<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20Transparency%20(Was%20Re:%20FreeNet%20downside)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000324211142.95804.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Its funny that people like you are the ones who say that Mutual Assured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Destruction is insane, when its the same exact principle. MAD assumes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neither party can be trusted, and only the external threat of instant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;annihilation is what keeps both parties in check. The MAD strategy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relied
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;completely on the idea that both sides had to keep as total a level of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance on the others activities as possible.
</EM><BR>
<P>And your point?  Mutually assured destruction in a vacuum *is* insane.  But 
<BR>
when your avowed enemy has amassed enough weaponry to utterly wipe you out 
<BR>
and the only way to keep him from doing that is to assure him that you've 
<BR>
got the weaponry to do the same to him, then MAD is the only viable 
<BR>
alternative.  If he wipes you out then you wipe him out and there is no 
<BR>
winner, only two losers.  Obviously the best outcome is a win-win situation. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But if my enemy is going to cause me to lose, I'd prefer a lose-lose 
<BR>
situation to a win-lose situation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;An honorable person needs no external consequences. A society that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;relies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only on external consequences has acknowledged that men are nothing but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;savages and have no honor or rights.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well as I'm sure you realize, it's not an all-or-nothing proposition.  Some 
<BR>
men *are* &quot;nothing but savages.&quot;  Others behave themselves in ways more 
<BR>
worthy of the title &quot;Citizen.&quot;  If there were no such thing as criminally 
<BR>
minded people, there would be no need to have this discussion.  The plain 
<BR>
fact though, is that that is not the case.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But you miss the point, transparency is not about treating people as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prisoners.  It's about treating people as family (which when you think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it is what they are).  I know almost everything about my wife.  Her
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; finances, her hopes, her fears, her weaknesses, her strengths.  I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; exactly how she'll react if I kiss the backs of her knees.  I know where 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;she
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is almost all the time.  Does that make her my prisoner?  Especially 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (1) she knows that I know these things about her and (2) she knows all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; same things about me?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You have that relationship and you know those things about each other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because you both trust each other, not the other way around.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think so.  You can't trust someone you don't know anything about.  I 
<BR>
don't trust you.  That doesn't mean you are a bad person.  All it means is 
<BR>
that I don't know enough about you to determine whether or not you are 
<BR>
trustworthy.  Sure all people are innocent until proven guilty, I just don't 
<BR>
make it a policy to give unknown people the opportunity to prove their guilt 
<BR>
on me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However, a true spousal relationship is based on the mutual trust that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comes from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;respect for the other, and the desire for respect from the other, such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could spend ten years apart from your spouse and they would trust that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would behave with respect toward them the entire time, even though they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have no idea what you are actually doing.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not necessarily.  If my wife just disappeared for 10 years without telling 
<BR>
me why and where she was going and when she'd be back, she would have to 
<BR>
come up with a *damn* good explanation when she got back in order to regain 
<BR>
my trust.  And to the extent that I would trust her while she was gone, that 
<BR>
trust would be based on the things I was able to learn about her before she 
<BR>
left.  In other words, my surveillance of her.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The thing is, I trust myself more than I trust you, this is a given.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However I do trust you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to an extent based on your record and based on the fact that you come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from a respectable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;background.
</EM><BR>
<P>In other words, you trust me to the extent that you've been able to do 
<BR>
&quot;surveillance&quot; on me.  Without the information gained regarding my record 
<BR>
and my respectable background, you'd have no basis for trusting me, right?  
<BR>
Thank you.  You have made my point better than I could have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The sort of people who beleive that Mutual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Assured
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Surveillance is the only option are the sort of people who beleive the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fascist &quot;People are no damn good and need to be controlled&quot; routine.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, not at all.  I believe in MAS, but I believe that people for the most 
<BR>
part want to be, and are, good.  But only an idiot could believe that there 
<BR>
is no such thing as cheaters.  MAS offers no threat to honorable people 
<BR>
because they have nothing to hide.  On the other hand, MAS encourages 
<BR>
dishonorable people to do the right thing.  In other words, we have the 
<BR>
highly sought after but rarely found &quot;win-win&quot; situation.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sureveillance is the worst sort of tyranny, it does not matter one whit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its all mutual.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sticks and stones...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Its the same thing with the socialist argument with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;property:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I don't trust anybody but myself to responsibly handly property, so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nobody has a right to property.
</EM><BR>
<P>Apples and oranges.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;back to the trust issue, we make a contract between us, where we both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;claim we are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;honorable, trust-worthy, and have integrity. Only those that break that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  contract can be judged to have no honor or integrity, and therefore
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have total surveillance. THis is the presumption of innocence. A total
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance society throws out the presumption of innocence, because by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;definition, the idea that all must be surveilled indicates that none
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can be trusted, that none have honor or integrity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, no.  MAS has nothing to do with the presumption of innocence.  I 
<BR>
presume everyone is innocent until proven otherwise.  MAS merely provides 
<BR>
*verification* of innocence, or the lack thereof.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The only difference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between a Mutual Surveillance Society, and a Big Brother Fascist Society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is that in the fascist society some (those in charge) are either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;presumed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by themselves or everyone to have honor and/or integrity, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;nobody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;else has any, while the Mutual Surveillance Society declares that no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has integrity or honor.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, again you miss the point.  MAS differs from an Orwellian fascist state 
<BR>
in one very important respect.  In the latter, only the government has the 
<BR>
power of surveillance over citizens.  The government itself is immune from 
<BR>
surveillance.  Therefore, all power follows the one-way flow of 
<BR>
information...to the government.  In my MAS society information flows 
<BR>
equally both to the government *and* to the people.  Therefore you know just 
<BR>
as much about the government as it knows about you, even more.  No more 
<BR>
fighting tooth and nail to get partial, misleading and redacted FOIA 
<BR>
information.  You just get on the web and point your browser to, say, 
<BR>
Clinton's bank records, or the full copies of all FBI, CIA, NSA, KGB, and 
<BR>
IRS records.  You can also access the name, address, telephone number and 
<BR>
location of anyone who accessed any of that information about you.  See 
<BR>
here's how it works:  Zero Powers looks up Michael Lorrey's bank records.  
<BR>
In order to do that I have to reveal my own identity so that, if he wants to 
<BR>
Michael Lorrey can (1) find out that I looked up his records, and (2) if he 
<BR>
wants to, he can do the same to me.
<BR>
<P>So now what?  I can say &quot;Hey Michael I see you just paid another $200 to the 
<BR>
ATF for another machine gun.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And you can say, &quot;Yes, I know that you know that.  And you also know that I 
<BR>
know you just paid $200 for another bullet-proof vest, but that wouldn't do 
<BR>
you much good if I decided to use my armor-piercing bullets on you.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And then I could say, &quot;Perhaps, but since I follow you around with the 
<BR>
ubiquitous public surveillance camera network, I would know the minute you 
<BR>
left your house with your machine gun and I could follow you as you got 
<BR>
closer and closer to my house.  As soon as you got within 100 feet of my 
<BR>
front door, I'd alert the AI police chief who would be ready to incapacitate 
<BR>
you with the nano-police the second you pointed your gun at me and put your 
<BR>
finger on the trigger.&quot;
<BR>
<P>And then you could say &quot;Yeah, I guess you're right.  So I won't kill you 
<BR>
today.  Hey wanna go check out a football game?&quot;
<BR>
<P>And then I could say &quot;Sure, but lets leave the machine guns at home this 
<BR>
time, OK?&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Trust is based upon respect, not intimate knowledge.
</EM><BR>
<P>Without at least some knowlege, what could there possibly be to base respect 
<BR>
upon?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;No, I would resent that you knew many private and embarrasing things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I would prefer that others did not know. You would know that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was a point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of embarrassment and would use it with your primate hard wired instincts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pecking order to humilitate and denigrate me in order to make yourself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;look better.
</EM><BR>
<P>Um, not quite.  See first of all you would not resent *me* because it 
<BR>
wouldn't be *my* fault that your private and embarrasing things are public 
<BR>
knowledge.  You might resent society, but that should not cause you to 
<BR>
direct that resentment toward me in particular.  More importantly, once you 
<BR>
found out that 95% of the people in your neighborhood had the exact same 
<BR>
private and embarrasing things contained in their public record, your 
<BR>
private and embarrasing things would cease to be either private or 
<BR>
embarrasing.  And once we found out that my private and embarrasing things 
<BR>
were even more private and embarrasing than yours, there'd be very little 
<BR>
incentive for my &quot;primate hard wired instincts&quot; to make much of a fuss about 
<BR>
your private and embarrasing things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Resentment leads to hate. You do not build trust on a foundation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah but you won't resent me.  See above.  Besides, I can be quite charming 
<BR>
when I have to be ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&quot;A society that would trade some freedom for security deserves neither
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;freedom nor security.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>MAS does not trade off any freedom.  MAS will give you *more* freedom than 
<BR>
you ever had before.  Imagine being free to go wherever, and do whatever, 
<BR>
you want without having to first get permission (no visas, licenses, 
<BR>
permits, nothing).  Imagine having instant access to *all* information all 
<BR>
the time.  No searching through remote and dusty archives, no paying a 
<BR>
private investigator.  Imagine having whatever your heart desires (a 
<BR>
supercomputer, a near-anything device).  All that and more for the small 
<BR>
price of making yourself as transparent as the rest of society.  Maybe it 
<BR>
seems like hell to you, but I can't wait.  (It is, after all, inevitable you 
<BR>
know?)
<BR>
