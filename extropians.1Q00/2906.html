<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And I predict you that although you may indeed find the correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; qualia theory someday you will never know for certain it's right, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact you'll never be able to prove that any qualia theory is correct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and you'll seldom even be able to prove that it's incorrect.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You missed what I'm claiming.  Just as we can say that our
<BR>
salty is not like our red, is not like our warm..., we will be able to
<BR>
augment our brains with generic qualia experience apparatus and throw
<BR>
additional sensations into our conscious awareness, undoubtedly some
<BR>
of which none of us have ever experienced or felt before (as in &quot;what
<BR>
is it like to be a bat?&quot;).  Just as our brain currently makes us able
<BR>
to know the differences between the ones it uses to represent
<BR>
information we will also be able to experience and to spiritually know
<BR>
and contrast what others use to represent information.  This is what I
<BR>
mean by &quot;effing&quot;.  The theory is that this kind of effing will be the
<BR>
proof that will end all these kinds of issues and that this will be
<BR>
the greatest scientific achievement of all time.  It will prove what
<BR>
you claim cannot be proven.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even you admit we don't have such a theory now so I wonder, are you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equally skeptical about the inner life of your fellow human beings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and if not why not?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though we can't yet know for sure, I have a good idea that
<BR>
others have inner lives.  Though I bet others do have spiritual inner
<BR>
lives, (and that todays computers only abstractly &quot;model&quot; such) I'd
<BR>
bet there are at least some people that use a different qualia to
<BR>
represent 700 nm light than the particular &quot;red&quot; one I use.  Again,
<BR>
the theory is that once we discover and can eff such and know why and
<BR>
how..., we will then finally objectively know and prove all this for
<BR>
sure.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That's why qualia theories don't interest me much.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This theory implies that we must be interrested in this and
<BR>
that we can go no place as long as we aren't interested in it.
