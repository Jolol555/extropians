<P>US Consumers Favor GM Crops to Curb Pesticides - Survey
<BR>
<P>HOUSTON (Reuters) - Nearly three-fourths of American consumers would support
<BR>
genetically modified crops if the technology means farmers can reduce
<BR>
pesticide use, according to a survey released Tuesday by the American Farm
<BR>
Bureau.
<BR>
<P>The private survey was commissioned at a time when some environmental groups
<BR>
have followed the lead of Europe and are pressing U.S. policymakers to
<BR>
tighten regulation of biotech crops because they say not enough is known
<BR>
about the long-term effects on human health.
<BR>
<P>Farm and food industry groups contend that the new technology improves crop
<BR>
yields and reduces the amount of chemicals needed to prevent insect and
<BR>
bacterial damage.
<BR>
<P>Some 1,002 consumers were interviewed for the survey in July and August,
<BR>
with the majority indicating they had heard more about the drawbacks of
<BR>
biotechnology rather than benefits.
<BR>
<P>More than half said they would support gene-altered corn, soybeans, squash
<BR>
and other crops if the technology would improve the taste and nutritional
<BR>
value of foods.
<BR>
<P>Some 73 percent of consumers surveyed favored biotech crops if they would
<BR>
help farmers cut back on pesticides.
<BR>
<P>``This research shows that many of us in agriculture have miscalculated
<BR>
where consumers' most pronounced concerns exist,'' said Jay Poole, vice
<BR>
president of agriculture for Philip Morris Cos Inc (NYSE:MO - news) Inc.
<BR>
<P>Philip Morris, which owns Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Post and Miller food brands,
<BR>
helped fund the survey.
<BR>
<P>Consumers also said they were willing to pay higher prices and have a
<BR>
smaller selection of foods in grocery stores if that would help reduce farm
<BR>
pesticide use.
<BR>
<P>``Some of these results really surprised us,'' said Dean Kleckner, president
<BR>
of the American Farm Bureau, which released the survey results at its annual
<BR>
meeting in Houston.
<BR>
<P>``It's clear that the agricultural industry has not done a good job
<BR>
educating consumers about the benefits of pesticide use. It's important we
<BR>
don't make the same mistake with biotechnology and other new farming
<BR>
practices.''
<BR>
<P>A related survey, conducted at the same time, asked 704 U.S. farmers to
<BR>
assess how well they have explained the benefits of biotechnology to
<BR>
consumers. Some 71 percent of farmers surveyed said they had done a fair or
<BR>
poor job.
