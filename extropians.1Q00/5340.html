<EM>&gt;wrote regarding Re: American Imperialism?:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Right, that is *not* imperialism.  Imperialism is extending a nation's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economic and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; political hegemony over other nations.  The US is not doing this.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; basically acting as the referee in the world's international wrestling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matches, and enforcing the rules when we notice low blows.  No, no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; appointed us as the referee, but we're the biggest kid on the block
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; assumed the role of shot caller by default.  Maybe its a good thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its not.  But it is definitely *not* imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I sincerely wish the U.S., was doing what you say, but unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the U.S. is still a very imperialist and interventionist country.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem with this discussion, perhaps, is carelessness with terminology. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree 100% that the US is &quot;interventionist.&quot;  I don't think *anyone* 
<BR>
denies that.  But &quot;interventionism&quot; and &quot;imperialism&quot; are not 
<BR>
interchangeable terms.  If the thrust of your position is that the US should 
<BR>
let the pendulum swing back a bit toward isolationism, I might not 
<BR>
necessarily disagree (although I have not fully considered the issue as it 
<BR>
has not specifically been raised in this thread).  But regardless of whether 
<BR>
or not you are a fan of US foreign policy the plain fact is that 
<BR>
&quot;imperialism&quot; is an untrue, unfair and perjorative description of US policy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But unfortunately when you live in America, you don't get all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about the things that happen in our regions of the world.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are not actually claiming that non-US citizens are more informed about 
<BR>
US foreign policy than Americans, are you?  If you are, I must beg to 
<BR>
differ.  Freedom of the press is one of our most cherished rights, and our 
<BR>
press is not shy in the least about putting Government policy (foreign or 
<BR>
otherwise) in a less than flattering light.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Speaking of my country (Mexico)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Although after the end of the usa/Mexico war when we lost more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;half our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;territory the usa has never invaded or threatened us militarily,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they've forced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;us to do what they think it's better using all sorts of resources or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;excuses.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is called foreign policy.  It's using your clout (political, economic, 
<BR>
or military) to induce your neighbors to act in your best interest.  *Every* 
<BR>
nation does it (or tries, or wants to do it).  But since the US has the most 
<BR>
clout it is usually the most successful at having other nations comply with 
<BR>
its wishes.  Again, like it or no, this simply is not imperialism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;An example of this is the certification measure, here in Mexico every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;time the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;congress up there is deciding if we'll get or not certified. it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;creates a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tension and hurts our relations because it's an unilateral procedure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;U.S. Interests only and not ours, but they still implement it, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;easier to use scape goats and pretend they are combating drug abuse by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;being tough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on poor defenseless countries instead of looking wiser alternatives to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this senseless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drug war, and I could quote several other examples (operation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;casablanca, etc.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the U.S. government does to force us their beliefs or systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And well to avoid unnecessary rants, I'll just say is not very fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for a country to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;use it's enormous military or economic power to force other countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do things they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't like, and that in my opinion is... imperialism, call it neo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imperialism if you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but it still doesn't make it any less worse.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not imperialism, neo-imperialism, retro-imperialism or 
<BR>
quasi-imperialism.  What you are talking about is mere &quot;influence.&quot;  
<BR>
Imperialism suggests exercising much more than mere influence upon a foreign 
<BR>
power.  Imperialism denotes &quot;hegemony.&quot;  At most the US attempts to impose a 
<BR>
moral or ideological &quot;hegemony,&quot; if you like, over its neighbors, but this 
<BR>
does not rise to the level of military, economic or political hegemony.  
<BR>
There is a big difference between the two, one is not imperialism, the other 
<BR>
is.
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Any comments?
</EM><BR>
<P>Octavio, don't misinterpret me, I'm not saying that US foreign policy is the 
<BR>
best.  I'm just trying to point out that it is *not* imperialism.  To call 
<BR>
America &quot;imperialist&quot; is merely to reveal your own displeasure over its 
<BR>
policies and to use the same sort of hyperbolic rhetoric as the pro-gun 
<BR>
folks who refer to gun-control proponents as &quot;fascists.&quot;  It doesn't further 
<BR>
your cause, it doesn't foster constructive dialogue, and makes you come 
<BR>
across as reactionary.
<BR>
<P>Just my dos centavos.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
