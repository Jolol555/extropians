<P><EM>&gt;  I've always scored off 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the scale (on the good side :-) in visualization and verbal skills, but am 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  basically a mathematical moron.  Thus I tend to translate almost all 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  intellectual problems into complimentary geometric and categorical terms.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Interesting.
<BR>
<P>I'm a mathematical moron as well. I've taken calculus two or three times.  AT 
<BR>
THE INSTANT the instructor was explaining it....I barely understood it.  A 
<BR>
week after the course was over it was as if I had never been exposed to the 
<BR>
subject.
<BR>
<P>Like you I'm basicly visual.  If I can't visualize 'what's going on&quot; then i'm 
<BR>
pretty well lost.  Consequently Quantum mechanics gives me fits.
<BR>
<P>To that extent I suspect that there ARE different types of &quot;intellegence&quot;.  
<BR>
Or maybe a different word is needed.  Perhaps your  term &quot;mental 
<BR>
archetecture&quot; is pointing us in a useful direction.
<BR>
<P>&quot;There's more than one way to skin a cat&quot;
