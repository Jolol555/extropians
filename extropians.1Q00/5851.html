<EM>&gt; Re flooding the rift valley:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; On the practical side, what do you [anyone] think about the impact of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  poor man's macroengineering project?  Would it be a net gain or loss for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  people living there and in adjoining regions?  What would its impact be in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  global climate and ecology?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the local humans, generally good: they'd get ocean access,  a milder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; climate, and more rain.  Some farmland and such gets flooded at the bottom,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it's probably replaceable.  Be a real headache keeping the pollution down,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the local ecology or paleontology, it's a catastrophe.  Desert critters do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very poorly in shallow seas and anything interesting gets covered up or eaten
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; :-/
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The rift valley isn't large enough to affect the whole world's climate or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ecology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; directly.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; The only thing separating the Rift Valley from being flooded is about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; 100 meters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; of rock on the shore of the Red Sea. I could fix that situation with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt; couple dozen pounds of C4.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not convinced that blowing a (relatively) small hole in the rock barrier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffice to flood the valley.  The flow rate would have to exceed evaporation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the entire flooded valley, and that's a lot.  There are several places
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where large river flows still don't suffice to raise a sea even close to sea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (e.g., the Caspian Sea) Flooding the rift valley is at most a mesoscale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; project,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but I think you'd need more than a few dozen pounds of conventional explosive.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Caspian sea is limited a) by the fact the Russians dammed off and
<BR>
redirected one of its main tributaries, and b) it is supplied by a
<BR>
limited water shed.
<BR>
<P>Compared to the size of the Rift Valley, the Indian Ocean is a virtually
<BR>
infinite watershed.
<BR>
<P>The sea level of the Indian ocean will not change, it will have a
<BR>
constant head pressure. Since the slope on the valley side of the
<BR>
separator has a significant drop to it, cutting one channel ten feet
<BR>
across from the sea to the slope would cause a significantly high flow
<BR>
and velocity, equal to a constant spring flood flow. The erosion will
<BR>
cause the channel to widen.  Granted that it needs to get bigger to get
<BR>
the Valley to equal sea level, but that isn't necessary, you aren't
<BR>
trying to make it a port. There is currently a small stream flowing into
<BR>
the valley from the sea, but the water seeps through the rock that
<BR>
blocks it off, but you are right, that small amount of flow that is
<BR>
existing evaporates off within a few miles. Making a large enough flow
<BR>
to cause significant erosion will create a self expanding channel.
