<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;Agreed. But why are you so certain there is no Supreme
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Being responsible for our creation?&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Simply by definition of a supreme not bound by physical laws
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is impossible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>You mean the physical laws that we have continually revised over
<BR>
thousands of years, indeed the same laws that have undergone half a
<BR>
dozen complete paradigmatic shifts? I wish I could share your certainty.
<BR>
I have no proof of a Christian god, and I would agree with all here that
<BR>
there is strong evidence that suggests the traditional story of God
<BR>
(Jaweh, etc.) is incorrect. However, this in no way precludes that we
<BR>
are the direct creation of creature(s) so far beyond our ken that they
<BR>
approach (are, or are beyond) our limited, &quot;known&quot; understanding of what
<BR>
it means to be Divinity. In much the same way it is always in the back
<BR>
of my mind that we could be running on a simulation (but I don't know
<BR>
for sure), I keep the answer to the question is there a   Creator as:
<BR>
Don't know, don't think so, but really, just don't know.
<BR>
<P>I try not to be middle of the road in most things, but when we are
<BR>
discussing things that are easily beyond my limited capacity to
<BR>
understand, then I have to. Anything else, one way or the other, and I
<BR>
think you are trying to sell me something.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;There are problems with all religions in that they try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make something that is by definition unknowable, knowable.&lt;&lt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One can't make something unknowable knowable, because by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first primes unknowable means cannot know. If you were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; referring to god in the above as the unknowable, then how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; does one conceive of the idea? And it is assumed unknowable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because it is make-believe.
</EM><BR>
<P>One can't conceive of the idea, but one can conceive of a limited
<BR>
portion of it. Which is what early religious thinkers/writers/speakers
<BR>
seemed to do. Even things that are arbitrarily large (massive, powerful,
<BR>
etc.) we can not wholly contain, but we have ways of bounding it,
<BR>
describing it, etc. And for the most part we only do so in pieces, and
<BR>
it's no wonder some of them don't work, contradict others, etc. Now, the
<BR>
big difference here is that I believe eventually we will be able to
<BR>
wholly and fully contain those things we can only partially describe
<BR>
now, but that would not be the case with something like the concept of
<BR>
God. Which is what I tried to indicate in my earlier post.
<BR>
<P>My only point of contention in all of this is my confusion that arises
<BR>
at your adamant stance. So you have no evidence for the existence of a
<BR>
God-like being that is your Creator. Does that automatically mean you
<BR>
have to believe the opposite? Isn't it a more rational choice to say
<BR>
that you don't know for sure, because, hey if something like that did
<BR>
exist, don't you think it could keep you in the dark about its existence
<BR>
for as long as it wished?
<BR>
