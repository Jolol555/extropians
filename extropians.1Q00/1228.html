<EM>&gt; &gt; Instead of pushing the valuation back towards the younger end of the

<EM>&gt; &gt; spectrum, it is probably much more rational to push it *ahead*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to the older end of the spectrum (though this flies in the face
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the emotional ties that soft wet cuddly babies generate).

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; This seems to be the real problem with the most extreme pro-choice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position, that it is tantamount to support for infanticide.  A mother
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who gives birth to a baby but finds after a few days that it is too much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; work should be able to smother it and throw it away, by this logic.

<EM>&gt;

<P>I would say that &quot;rationally&quot;, there probably are (rare) cases when
<BR>
infanticide is justified.  I don't think the case you cite however
<BR>
is one of them.  The mother has made a substantial investment in
<BR>
producing the child and there are many parents who have trouble
<BR>
having children.  So giving the child up for adoption is the logical
<BR>
choice.
<BR>
<P>Infanticide should only be considered in situations where the support
<BR>
of the child threatens the support of other children (who have a higher
<BR>
information content), or some careful analysis indicates that the
<BR>
support of the child would result in a net decrease of the resources
<BR>
of a society.
