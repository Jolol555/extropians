<EM>&gt; To my knowledge not. I'm working on memory transfer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hippocampus and cortex, and there is no real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evidence this can occur -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which makes life much harder for me :-) What seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to happen in my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasearch is that one part of the brain can train
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; another part to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same function, but this a rather special case
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and likely not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workable everywhere else.
</EM><BR>
oh well.... hmm.  If one part can train another part
<BR>
to do the same function... can this part be forced to
<BR>
do the training?  If you suppresed one section of the
<BR>
brain and had the hardware equivalent for it to work
<BR>
with... and if you did this with each section.... 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; As for uploading, I guess that if you integrate a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neural network to your mind, and learn how to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; integrate the network
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with your thinking, gradually more and more of your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thought processes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would exist within the computing matrix. The problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that &quot;you&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be growing - it would not be that your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memories and everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *moved* to the computer, but rather that new parts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developed inside it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enhancing your abilities. So the old brain would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; still be needed until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough interconnections had emerged to make it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrelevant - but that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might not happen for some functions.
</EM><BR>
Maybe at that point &quot;you&quot; would be more inside the
<BR>
computer than out... at which point, copying that one
<BR>
little original bit might be nothing more than
<BR>
minor... since your authentic self was now more inside
<BR>
than outside the computer, so to speak.  So I guess it
<BR>
wouldn't be &quot;you&quot; so much as &quot;mostly you&quot;... the
<BR>
question, I guess, would be how much is enough?
