<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the alleged stand Frito-Lay took as being against genetic
<BR>
engineering of food, I just received a seemingly generic response stating
<BR>
somewhat differently.  It is as follows:
<BR>
<P><P>--------------------------
<BR>
<P>Thank you for contacting Frito-Lay.  We are always pleased when our
<BR>
consumers 
<BR>
take the time to share their thoughts with us.
<BR>
<P>Now that there is a renewed interest in biotechnology by regulatory agencies
<BR>
<P>and some consumer concern exists, we did not feel it appropriate to ask our 
<BR>
growers to include bt crops in what they sell us.
<BR>
<P>Just like other food companies, Frito-Lay relies on and supports the
<BR>
regulatory 
<BR>
agencies charged with safeguarding our food supply when sourcing ingredients
<BR>
<P>for our products.  These agencies continue to report that genetically
<BR>
modified 
<BR>
ingredients are perfectly safe.
<BR>
<P>Since we are also a large buyer of agricultural commodities, and more than a
<BR>
<P>quarter of the North American crop is derived from biotechnology, just like 
<BR>
other food companies, we could have biotechnology ingredients in our
<BR>
products.
<BR>
<P>Thank you for taking the time to contact Frito-Lay.  We hope this
<BR>
information 
<BR>
is helpful.

<BR>
<P>Email Body:
<BR>
&nbsp;Dir Sir or Madam
<BR>
&nbsp;As the genetic engineering of foods is done on a very basic cellular
<BR>
level, it is an extremely far-fetched guess that any potential health
<BR>
concerns could come to fruition.  Though Frito-Lay is indeed a public
<BR>
company whose business relies upon the market's acceptance of the product,
<BR>
a premature stand against GE will likely be detrimental to the science as a
<BR>
whole.  By compromising the company's initial standards, you will give the
<BR>
public the impression that GE *is* harmful, and while Frito-Lay will likely
<BR>
see a raise in profits, these will only be attributed
<BR>
to misinformation and the compromising of any potential integrity the
<BR>
company has heretofore possessed.
<BR>
&nbsp;In the name of integrity and scientific justice, please withhold your
<BR>
stand until thorough tests prove the truth one way or another.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sincerely, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-E. Shaun Russell
