<P>( To my pretty bold statement that software engineers describe intelligence 
<BR>
in terms of software capabilities.)
<BR>
<P>&lt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;This was likely true, but if you look at what is going on currently in
<BR>
&nbsp;the congitive sciences and reinforcement learning community, people
<BR>
&nbsp;are definitely getting interested in emotions as essential part of
<BR>
&nbsp;intelligence.

<P>Thank you. It seems so obvious to an artist that they are essential to 
<BR>
thought, for my job is to bring out of my intelligence, the emotive material 
<BR>
I require, onto an image, into the visual arena,  where it can be processesd 
<BR>
by the cortex (eyes) into the brain in an entirely non-verbal way. 
<BR>
<P>But is humor actually an emotion? Of the same type as sadness, for example? 
<BR>
Is it not, rather a sensibility? 
<BR>
Are sensibilities and emotions really the same thing?
<BR>
<P>Is there a correcation between happiness and homor? 
<BR>
Psychologically, humor is sported often JUST when people are enduring pain 
<BR>
and sadness, sort of as a survival technique.
<BR>
<P>If humor is an emotion, then are other sensibilities, such as talent, taste 
<BR>
and aptitude emotions too?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From my rather lay-woman's point of view, the only emotion that science seems 
</EM><BR>
to have researched exhaustively are anxiety and chronic sadness (depression) 
<BR>
, in order to cure it. Aern't the more &quot; acceptable&quot; ones, like happiness, 
<BR>
bliss, boredom, rejection, satisfaction, caring, enthusiasm, love, 
<BR>
trepidation, curiousity, hope, greed, pity, gratefulness, uncertainty, etc. 
<BR>
etc. etc. etc, are still really un-understood.
