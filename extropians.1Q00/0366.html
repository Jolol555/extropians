<EM>&gt; .. and of course greatly preferable to using bacteria (there are bacteria

<P>All of the Mycobacteria and probably some of the ultra-micro bacteria
<BR>
strains are probably adaptable.  The &quot;control&quot; problem is easy to solve
<BR>
since you can engineer in suicide triggers.  I think the advantage to
<BR>
bacteria is that you can really &quot;engineer&quot; them to be high production
<BR>
factories.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) Immunoreaction takes time to gear to full response
</EM><BR>
<P>You are going to get some inflamation as soon as the proteins get
<BR>
displayed in the MHC complexes, that should only be a matter of
<BR>
hours after you turn on the protein production.  I agree a large
<BR>
reaction would take immune system amplification and that would
<BR>
take days to weeks.
<BR>
<P>Now how long you have to worry about this depends on how fast you
<BR>
can produce sufficient protein concentration to allow the next stage
<BR>
of the cool down.  You can't cool down too much while you are still
<BR>
producing the protein because you reduce protein production.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) Immunoreaction can be supressed (and, with a typical patient, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    not in the best shape anyway)
</EM><BR>
<P>This seems to be a good solution for cryonics but a bad solution for
<BR>
long-term gene &quot;enhancements&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; We're talking about the end of your biological life span, something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taking few days or weeks at best. The problem is having a quantitative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tranfection vector targeting neural tissue without destroying it.
</EM><BR>
<P>The real trick is &quot;quantitative&quot;, one of the reasons the cryoprotectant
<BR>
fluids are so viscous is because the concentrations are so high.
<BR>
What you would like is a low concentration fluid that &quot;sticks&quot; once
<BR>
inside.  Then you could pump it in at low concentrations but it would
<BR>
get selectively concentrated to higher and higher levels in the cells.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Doing it before (say, at birth) is very risky since gene
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; insertions are never quantitative and not as targeted as we would wish
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I don't think a walking bag of carcinomas is a tolerable side effect).
</EM><BR>
<P>Adeno-Associated Virus insertions are fairly specific, as would be
<BR>
insertions managed by the VDJ-recombinase (normally used in tuning
<BR>
the immune system).  What we need and currently lack (to my knowledge)
<BR>
is a general understanding of how one gets site (sequence) specificity
<BR>
for things like the AAV/VDJ insertion enzymes or even general gene
<BR>
promoters (Zn fingers, leucine zippers, etc.).  Once we understand that
<BR>
information we should be able to engineer factors that target insertions
<BR>
to highly specific locations.  The *real* problem however is that if
<BR>
you need anything more than a few 10's of kilo-bases for your
<BR>
cryoprotectant &quot;system&quot;, the current vectors are simply too small
<BR>
and will likely remain that way for some time.  Threading 100K
<BR>
of DNA through a nuclear pore into the nucleus is not going to be an
<BR>
easy problem to solve.  Given this fact, a bacterial system begins to
<BR>
look much more attractive.
<BR>
<P>This is the same problem we face in &quot;reversing&quot; aging in adults
<BR>
and is something I've devoted a lot of thought to.  Biobots with
<BR>
supplemental genomes are I think the way to go until nanobots become
<BR>
feasible.  Cryoprotectant manufacturing vehicles would be an interesting
<BR>
application because you don't have the normal approval headaches
<BR>
since the person is technically &quot;dead&quot;.  However, this isn't exactly
<BR>
a &quot;booming&quot; market.
