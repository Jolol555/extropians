<P><EM> &gt; I'd like to hear from anyone else here with odd internal-imagery

<EM> &gt; modalities. (I should add that I seem to use a kind of ancillary

<EM> &gt; space; so I can score fairly well on those

<EM> &gt; rotate-the-gadget-and-say-which-one-is-next tests in IQ trials, by turning
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; myself into one and dancing. I almost immediately knew the answer to one
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; famous question about tetrahedra, cited in an A. C. Clarke novel, that only
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; geniuses are supposed to get. But I'm damned if I can *picture* a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; tetrahedron in my head...)
</EM><BR>
<P>I've done a fair bit of dream-CAD to visualize things, and I always understand
<BR>
an equation better once I've graphed it out. While I've gotten proficient at
<BR>
writing HTML code on a text editor, and will use same to refine my pages, I
<BR>
still prefer the WYSIWYG editors like Composer or Front Page to hack out large
<BR>
tracts of rough pagespace. Sketching or writing things out always improves my
<BR>
comprehension and understanding, but my SAT scores were relatively even: 640
<BR>
verbal / 720 math. Calculus, OTOH, was very demanding, and graphical/spatial
<BR>
visualization helped immensely. High school calculus was first period (ugh) so
<BR>
my narcolepsy was a major hindrance, especially as my calc teacher was Mr.
<BR>
Templeton, whose voice  makes Ben Stein's seem dramatic and animated by
<BR>
comparison. I think his monotone frequency was right about on key to the note
<BR>
that makes me fall asleep. It took some doing to get him to understand that 
<BR>
some
<BR>
of us needed graphical association to understand some concepts.
<BR>
<P>Funny thing is that I'm a writer and graphic artist mostly, who is technically
<BR>
astute and can figger the maths and programs out all by my lonesome without
<BR>
looking stupid to engineers or programmers. Engineering is fun and demanding,
<BR>
but without the union card its hard to make a decent buck.
