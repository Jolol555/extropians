<P><P>This seems analogous to government (and other) power transitions.

In many countries and corporations, the dethroned leaders are
<BR>
not punished, but allowed to retire in luxury, even if their
<BR>
successors hate them and blame them for all evils.  The reason
<BR>
for nice treatment seems simple - they expect their own successors
<BR>
to treat them in a similar way.  The next stage has all the power,
<BR>
and often the anger - but doesn't hurt anybody.  This actually works
<BR>
to the degree that I often find disgusting - hardly any communists
<BR>
and fascists got punished, even when they could have been.
<BR>
That's only in recent history though...
