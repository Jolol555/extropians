&nbsp;One's value to others is generally based on how one acts with them,
<BR>
&nbsp;not how one believes.  Acting in ways that encourage others to value
<BR>
&nbsp;you is a good way to accomplish selfish goals.  &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>If you are &quot;acting&quot; then you will be found out. Selfish acts of kindness are 
<BR>
transparent.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;As far as overvaluing
<BR>
&nbsp;oneself, how is it possible to overvalue that which is the source of
<BR>
&nbsp;all values?
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>If you believe yourself to be the source of all values, because you set your 
<BR>
own values, that is a subjective lie. The trick is to see ourselves and our 
<BR>
value *accurately* within our subset of humanity. A selfish person has a hard 
<BR>
time taking an honest inventory of their value. If one takes into account  
<BR>
your value in relationship to what you present *objectively* to the 
<BR>
environment around you (what you bring to the table -- like your actions upon 
<BR>
the earth, how you treat your own family, what you achieve at work, the love 
<BR>
you mkae and take, the joy you give, how much you contribute to the 
<BR>
community, what you produce, how much you consume, etc.) their *is* a true 
<BR>
value as percieved by that environment, and it can be other than your own 
<BR>
self-made one. 
<BR>
<P>I repeat it' s hard to be objective, but an objective standard does exist. 
<BR>
<P>Selfish people always believe themselves to be more valuable than reality 
<BR>
reflects, and many are blind to it. 
<BR>
<P>N
<BR>
PS:
<BR>
This usually reflects in this way: they hold a different set of standards for 
<BR>
their own actions than for others.
