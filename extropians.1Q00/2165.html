<P><EM>&gt; Yes. But *some* of what he's pointing at scares the shit out of me anyway.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to know exactly what the patent claim allows. Presumably Geron can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demand a royalty on every natural conception (which is the sort of global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; claim over embryo creation Rifkin seems to be implying), but only over the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use of certain precise in vitro procedures. Right? E.g., a different but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perhaps related point: I *really* hate the idea of human DNA fragments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being `patented'; as well patent the idea of the eye.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is my understanding that patents must claim novelty (clearly not
<BR>
the case with human &quot;conceptions&quot;) and they may only be enforced
<BR>
for the &quot;claims&quot; in the patents (e.g. creating clones).
<BR>
<P>Now, we still have a fair number of years before cloning technology
<BR>
is *useful* for something.  Think of the industry that would have
<BR>
to be developed to grow brainless bodies for organ replacements
<BR>
and then think about the fact that the patent only lasts 20 years.
<BR>
As far as a real use for cloning, such as cloning cells for
<BR>
seeding lab-grown organs, you again have the infrastructure
<BR>
problem on top of the organ specific differentiation problem.
<BR>
If they can get this to the reality stage in 10 years, I don't
<BR>
think I'd mind paying Geron royalties to get a new set of organs.
<BR>
<P>The patents on human DNA aren't on the DNA itself, they are on
<BR>
the *uses* of the DNA sequences in specific applications.  If
<BR>
I come up with a different application that wasn't in the
<BR>
original claims, then I believe I can file a patent on that.
<BR>
[Someone with more legal expertise may want to comment on
<BR>
my perception in this area.]
<BR>
<P>Then there is the problem of polymorphisms.  If I patent a sequence
<BR>
of DNA, can someone use a naturally occuring sequence that is
<BR>
different due to polymorphisms that was not in the original patent?
<BR>
Proteins have a fair amount of tolerance for changes in their
<BR>
amino-acid sequence.  I doubt any of the patents filed thus
<BR>
far cover all of the possible substitutions that can be made
<BR>
in the original sequence to get a &quot;different&quot; unpatented molecule.
<BR>
<P>All of these things and some others I can't discuss provide
<BR>
good reason to believe that the DNA patenting discussion contains
<BR>
a large amount of noise.  Now, at the same time, novel *processes*
<BR>
such as invented for the cloning process are probably worth patenting.
<BR>
[Think of how much work went into that and how much it went against
<BR>
the conventional wisdom that cloning was &quot;impossible&quot;.]
<BR>
<P>Think of how many patents cover the CPUs in the computers on
<BR>
your desk.  Hundreds?  Thousands?  That doesn't in any way
<BR>
prevent you from enjoying the benefits of the ideas those
<BR>
patents protect.  In fact it probably helps you enjoy them
<BR>
since it allows corporate managers and investors to compute
<BR>
a 20 year ROI.  But jeeesh, from our perspective on &quot;20 years&quot;,
<BR>
why thats a scab on a tick on a mouse in your house.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and if cloned human embryos are, in fact, considered to be human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inventions, then what becomes of our notion of the Tooth Fairy?
</EM><BR>
<P>The embryos are not the &quot;invention&quot;, the &quot;cloning&quot; process is.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh no, waaaah--
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't cry Damien, I believe the Tooth Fairy comes under the &quot;prior art&quot;
<BR>
provisions.
