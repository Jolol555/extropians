<P><EM>&gt;As I hope folks are aware, the list I'm compiling is certainly not an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;enemies list&quot; per se, but rather an attempt to put together resources for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;monitoring the development of ideas and organizations that have one or more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;items of active anti-progress ideology or value in their make-up.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Never crossed my mind,  I don't see you as an enemy monger :)  You are far
<BR>
too &quot;divinely tall and most divinely fair.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It's also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not officially associated with Extropy Institute in any way - it's just a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;personal project of my own.  I'm simply looking to create a set of links to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make monitoring a wide spectrum of groups and movements easier.
</EM><BR>
<P>Frankly, I would like ExI to associate itself with debates, taking on those
<BR>
who oppose our stance on issues.  I hope your personal project is somehow
<BR>
integrated into an ExI protocol to be of help to us all.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Regarding &quot;greens&quot;, it pains me particularly to see what's happened to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;environmental movement&quot;, but the anti-science, anti-technology and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-enterprise tendencies of even most mainstream &quot;environmental&quot; groups
</EM><BR>
has 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;becomes quite clear-cut to me in the last few years, so much so that I've 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;come to describe myself with the older word &quot;conservationist&quot; so as to avoid 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;association with the likes of Greenpeace.  Folks who know me well will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;realize that this is particularly galling, because I'm more at home outdoors 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the wilderness than in any city.
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand what you are saying Greg, as I have been fighting this battle
<BR>
as well.  As an performer whose stage had been the Global environment, it
<BR>
pains me that my work must be put aside so not to be associated with the
<BR>
hounding and blabbing of environmental wet-ears. I lived with the Navajo
<BR>
Indians long before it was the &quot;in&quot; thing to do, before Carlos Castanada,
<BR>
and I performed in the Amazon Jungle long before the environmental loonies
<BR>
got their feet wet in the Black River.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As to the Green Party, I know that it has become the most effective 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-technology group in Europe, especially in Germany, the first country in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which party members hold ministerial posts.  I would personally include them 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on an &quot;anti-progress&quot; watch list here in the US because I fear they may 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;become the &quot;respectable&quot;, establishment front for more radical &quot;deep
</EM><BR>
ecology&quot; 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;types and Rifkinites in general.  One of the key developments I'm looking
</EM><BR>
out 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;for (and hoping I don't see) is an explicit opposition to ALL genetic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;engineering as part of official Green Party platforms.
</EM><BR>
<P>What you are saying is valid and it very may well be that the Green Party
<BR>
has folded so deeply in Rifkinite poverty of intellect that its world mark
<BR>
has become an anti-progress declaration in the guise of a respectability.  
<BR>
<P>I think your &quot;Opposition to Transhumans&quot; resource is essential and an
<BR>
excellent resource for us all.  We need such a resource and you are one of
<BR>
the most capable people to produce it.  We need to know facts and not be
<BR>
swayed by emotions triggered obstreperously.  I also think that opposing
<BR>
issues first and groups second is a good strategy. 
<BR>
<P>Thanks Greg!
