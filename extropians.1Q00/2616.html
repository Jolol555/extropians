<P><P><EM>&gt; Where have you been for the past decade? It's been done. Your observations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are not new, and are actually fairly naive in many ways. You need to read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some Nozick, for example. And Friedman, my own writings, those of other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cypherpunks, and so on.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have been active in cryptographic activities some time ago, including the
<BR>
creation of a national radio show to protest against what happened to
<BR>
Zimmerman and Clipper! Does that give me some starting credo ?
<BR>
<P>I agree that my observations are perhaps not new and are perhaps niave.
<BR>
Therefore I do have further reading to do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Your &quot;in a perfect society locks and ciphers would not be needed&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophy is...uninteresting.
</EM><BR>
<P>Tim, please do not misquote me. Perhaps from your perspective, it is
<BR>
uninteresting.
<BR>
<P>I make the assertion that 10000 years ago, locks and ciphers were not needed
<BR>
because at that time, society was not sufficiently constructed to need them.
<BR>
However, at that time, rights were needed, as society has always needed
<BR>
rights. At that time, society used physical implements and other
<BR>
constructions to maintain rights.
<BR>
I make the assertion that 0 years ago, locks and ciphers are needed, because
<BR>
at this time, society is sufficiently constructed to need them. At this
<BR>
time, rights are needed, as society has always needed rights. At this time,
<BR>
society uses cryptography and other mechanisms to maintain rights, and sees
<BR>
physical implements as an irrelevant historical artificat.
<BR>
I make the assertion that 1000 years henceforth, locks and ciphers _may not_
<BR>
be needed, because in such a time, society may be sufficiently advanced
<BR>
beyond these notions. In that time, rights will still be needed, as society
<BR>
has always needed rights. At this time, society uses some other mechanism to
<BR>
maintain rights, and sees both physical implements and cryptography as a
<BR>
historical artifact.
<BR>
<P>Therefore, I agree that at the present time, and for the forseeable future,
<BR>
based upon our realistic extrapolations of the developments of technology
<BR>
and society, that cryptography is needed. I agree with you Tim. Cryptography
<BR>
is not just needed, it is fundamental.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this seems pointless, what am I arguing about ? I am trying to argue
<BR>
about a bigger picture. What is the point of arguing about a bigger picture
<BR>
? A bigger picture helps frame what is happening now. What is the point of
<BR>
this ? It helps convince people that cryptography is the appropriate
<BR>
technology; people who may otherwise still perceive it as an esoteric
<BR>
technology but are convinced by reasoning that illustrates its place in the
<BR>
bigger picture.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I suggest that instead of trying to get someone to fund your stupid idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that you instead do some basic reading and then move on to more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issues.
</EM><BR>
<P>Firstly, Tim, please do not say that my ideas are &quot;stupid&quot;;
<BR>
- - perhaps I have not fully explained my self ? perhaps you have not
<BR>
comprehended me properly ?
<BR>
- - perhaps my totality of experiences puts me at a different perspective
<BR>
than does the totality of yours ?
<BR>
- - perhaps my ideas may be &quot;stupid&quot;, but perhaps that is not something that
<BR>
can be determined for a very long time ?
<BR>
- - perhaps the outcome of the pursuit of my &quot;stupid&quot; ideas is some
<BR>
&quot;non-stupid&quot; results ? (If I could remember a quote that suggest that
<BR>
philosophers think that their ideas are the absolute, but they should
<BR>
realise that the importance of their ideas are the way in which they can be
<BR>
broken down and used and developed by further philosophers).
<BR>
<P>In any case, perhaps also my comment about funding was a general comment
<BR>
that I realise I need to do further reading and investigation in order to
<BR>
determine something particularly worthwhile to spend time on. In fact, that
<BR>
was the intention of my comment. Perhaps I did not express it properly or
<BR>
perhaps you misinterpreted it.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps I have got my knickers into a knot again ?
<BR>
<P>Best regards,
<BR>
Matthew.
