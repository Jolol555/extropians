Damien Broderick:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;All those salesfolk and skyscrapers are not mainly there to move stuff
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;from factories to your home, or even to design the things the factories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;make.  They perform lots of other useful functions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What, though, when all is said and done?  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My question is, what economic functions must be performed in those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;skyscrapers when and if we have a combination of positional synthesisers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and human-level AI (not necessarily conscious, but the kind of thing that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happens due to Moore's curve, by general consensus in 20-40 years.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Assuming advanced AI is very different from just assuming early nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But hang on, you've snipped my key linking statement, where I claimed:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But of course this assumes bizarrely that *only* replicative nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;happens in the future.  Moore's Law hasn't shut down, the computers are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;getting better all the time, and nano is feeding into that curve with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;smaller and faster computers built at molecular scales
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So I assume any disagreement involves timelines for these innovations.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Which is where we came in.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think it is very productive to have a conversation about what the
<BR>
economy will be like in &quot;the future&quot;.  The future is very long and large,
<BR>
and there will be many different economies in different times and places.
<BR>
<P>Most people don't think you can have any useful discussion about the
<BR>
future, since so many things can possibly change.  If we are going to
<BR>
buck this convention, we should take care to be as disciplined as
<BR>
possible.  If we are careful, maybe we can say something about early
<BR>
nanotech, early AI, early uploading, or even early space colonization,
<BR>
at least when each of these things is among the first big new changes.
<BR>
But it is much harder to say things about late versions of these things,
<BR>
or or about early versions of these given that several of these other
<BR>
changes have already happened.
<BR>
<P>That all said, if you want to assume that nanotech happens in the next
<BR>
thirty years, but that computers just improve as they have been, I'd say
<BR>
this is *not* necessarily an AI scenario.  Thirty years of the same sort
<BR>
of improvement we've had in the last thirty years gives you fast machines,
<BR>
but not necessarily human level software.  That software is what is
<BR>
required to replace all those people working in skyscrapers today.
