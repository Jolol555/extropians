<P><EM> &gt; I'd go a lot further than this.  First off, accidents that destroy the brain
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; are fairly rare, so even if you die young your odds of getting a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; halfway-decent suspension are pretty good.  It is pretty hard to die in a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; way that prevents your body from arriving at a hospital within an hour or
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; less - just don't get yourself killed while you're off camping in the middle
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of nowhere.
</EM><BR>
<P>Uh, do you you have actual numbers for this brash assertion? Are you
<BR>
claiming that essentially all patients are suspended after one hour or
<BR>
less after death has occured (not pronounced)? Don't think so.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Second, and more important, most people have an excessively narrow view of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; what constitutes an adequate suspension.  Remember, if cryonics patients are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ever revived at all, that means we're positing nanotech advanced enough to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; repair any kind of physical damage.  The only thing that matters in that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; situation is whether the information that defines your memories and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; personality can be recovered from your brain tissue.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
This sentence is insoncistent. Clearly there is physical damage that
<BR>
is irrepairable (say, incineration, or a week stored at RT) which
<BR>
destroys essentially all information about a particular individuum.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Now, what people tend to overlook is that the problem of deducing the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; original information content of a scrambled brain is isomorphic to the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; problem of deducing the information content of an encrypted message.  Given
</EM><BR>
<P>Another assertion. Based on what?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; modern cryptographic techniques and abundant computing power, that means
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that no non-random form of damage can prevent a successful revival.  A
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, you're already immortal. Why bothering with a suspension at
<BR>
all? Future science will reconstruct yourself from trajectories of
<BR>
atmospheric CO2. Or from a piece of apple pie, whatever is closer at
<BR>
hand. 
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; completely random encryption is unbreakable, and so is a completely random
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; source of damage.  However, very few types of physical injury produce truly
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; random changes at the molecular level.  If the history of cryptography is
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, right.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; any guide, we should expect that even the most subtle kinds of regularity
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; can be used to reverse the effects of even the most radical perturbations.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; What does this all mean in English?  Basically, that burning your brain
</EM><BR>
<P>I could comment, but I don't want to offend anybody.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; destroys information, but dropping a rock on it doesn't.  Most of the damage
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; sources that cryonicists agonize over, like freezing damage and ischemic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; injury, are very regular in nature and hence should be very easy to reverse.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; So, your odds of getting an adequate suspension are very high no matter how
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you end up dying.
</EM><BR>
<P>I knew cryonics was a religion, but I never saw it demonstrated so clearly.
