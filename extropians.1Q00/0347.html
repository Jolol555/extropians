Current high-energy crops are optimized for profit maximization (and
<BR>
hence centralization), not optimal taste. _Truly_ (i.e. not just a
<BR>
marketing ploy) organically grown foods have typically a better taste
<BR>
(when cost is less an issue and goodies are grown locally, you can
<BR>
harvest at optimal ripeness) and less pesticide residues. They
<BR>
preserve energy (nitrogen fixation is still most efficiently done by
<BR>
legumes), don't contaminate the ground water and do not kill the soil
<BR>
(latter an important but often-overlooked factor), and are less a
<BR>
species diversity killer, which tends to stabilize ecosystems.
<BR>
<P>Of course if all you want is to provide calories cheaply (strangely,
<BR>
people are still starving out there) and do not care about
<BR>
environmental long term impact (Singularity aloha), fossil-fuel
<BR>
powered gene-tweaked turbocrops are the way to go. Beats soylent green
<BR>
or fidipur any time ;)
<BR>
<P>Personally I think if technology develops as expected the problem of
<BR>
food generation (and hence its very noticeable environmental impact)
<BR>
will not be an issue for very long.
