<EM>&gt;I don't know if anyone has thought of this before, but how about getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Right to Life individuals to support abortion by cryopreserving aborted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fetuses?  Surely, cryopreserving them would be cheaper.  If we can get them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to fund this sort of thing, it would be a way to both spread cryonics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;defuse a very deep conflict in Western societies.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting idea, but it would cost an extremely high amount of money per
<BR>
fetus (especially considering that most aborted fetuses are unwanted in the
<BR>
first place), and would still leave the problem of who would eventually
<BR>
reanimate and raise the child.  Chances are, when the technology to revive
<BR>
suspended clients arrives, we will already have the ability to overcome
<BR>
many of the genetic defects that prevent would-be parents from having a
<BR>
'natural' birth (i.e.: progeny with their own gene selection), and adoption
<BR>
of such aborted fetuses would be unnecessary.  Still, your idea has some
<BR>
seeds of possibility in other areas.  Eventually the price of cryonics will
<BR>
be driven down once more people begin to sign up; I foresee that cryonics
<BR>
may be an option for wealthier parents of babies born (or fetuses
<BR>
developing) with severe birth defects.  It would at least give the parents
<BR>
the peace of mind that a cure could arrive at any moment.  I suppose we'll
<BR>
find out soon enough.
