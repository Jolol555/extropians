Genesis 3:&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
22  And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
23    Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he was taken.&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
24    So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.&lt;p&gt;
<BR>
<P>I surfed into above.  I'd forgotten how important it is to the Christian version of God, that humans not live for ever.  Adam got evicted for disobedience, then locked out to prevent him from eating a fruit that that would make him more like God.  God should be stepping in any moment now, to kick extropian researchers out of their labs.:)  Keep a close eye on your landlords.&lt;p&gt;
