</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unfortunately, as the closest thing to a list moderator this anarchic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;community has, I do not have the luxury of killfiling anybody -- and I feel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an obligation to at least skim every post.  Imagine my annoyance in a busy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;week when I see another unproductive outbreak of discussion of guns that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;admittedly does appear to contain some calm and rational discourse, but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;contains WAY too many posts that amount to little more than rude, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hyperbolic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;name-calling.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;PLEASE exercise some discretion and sense.  PLEASE use a topic header that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;identifies your post as a &quot;gun debate&quot; post and PLEASE work to minimize the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;volume of your posts.  Finally, just because someone on the other side of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;issue from you acts like a jackass and uses the childish rhetoric of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;name-calling, don't think it does your own position any credit to fall to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;same level.
</EM><BR>
<P>As most of you know, I am a relatively new comer to this list.  As such, I 
<BR>
was not aware that the gun debate was a horse that has apparently been 
<BR>
beaten to death, revived and beaten to death again.  So I will not be 
<BR>
subjecting the list to any more of my opinions on the topic.
<BR>
<P>I do however want to make sure that I am not lumped in with those who 
<BR>
devolved to the level of name calling, even though I was the main instigator 
<BR>
of the debate.  What I was looking for was rational, if passionate, debate 
<BR>
about what I feel to be an important, and list-relevant, issue.  As I stated 
<BR>
at the outset of the thread, I don't do flamewars and the minute someone 
<BR>
resorted to that my replies to them stopped.  So, for what its worth, those 
<BR>
of you who felt the need to killfile me can safely undo (for now).
