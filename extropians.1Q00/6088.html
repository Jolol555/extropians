<EM>&gt;&gt;Does this mean you have a rekindled interest in the equity markets as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;sound investments, or are you still solidly behind certain real estate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;investments to the exclusion of stocks?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Huh?  If investors were rational and equally informed, *all*
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;You did suggest that many economists are less well informed than you
<BR>
about the questions you addressed. If Steve thought that that lack of
<BR>
information was peculiar to economists, he probably wouldn't have asked
<BR>
that question.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If people are not rational and if I think I have better info than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;others, then I need to compare the *price* of stocks to future
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Don't assume you need to know the price of an investmemt to have
<BR>
a better than random opinion on that price. A significant fraction
<BR>
of the investment strategies with good track records simply amount
<BR>
to observing that others are pessimistic or optimistic (i.e. if
<BR>
analysts underestimated a company's most recent earnings report,
<BR>
they were too pessimistic, and pessimism tends not to vanish instantly).
<BR>
&nbsp;Your observation that few people are interested in the possibility
<BR>
of a singularity provides a reason for expecting that investors are
<BR>
too pessimistic about growth rates, and this presumed pessimism
<BR>
provides information about how investments are likely to be mispriced.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If I knew we were about to see explosive growth in the next ten
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;years, that *still* wouldn't tell me to invest in stocks as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opposed to all the other forms of investment available.  A big
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Second-guessing investors about questions which they know are important
<BR>
is usually less productive than finding questions that they are ignoring.
<BR>
Lots of attention is currently being focused on whether to buy and hold
<BR>
the S&amp;P500.
<BR>
&nbsp;The most obvious implication of pessimism about long-term growth rates
<BR>
is that people are likely to underestimate what long-term interest rates
<BR>
should be.
<BR>
&nbsp;Another possible implication is that investors are underestimating the
<BR>
industries that would drive the increase in growth rates. If it is
<BR>
possible to guess what those industries will be, it seems likely that
<BR>
they are good investments. It also seems likely that there will be many
<BR>
&quot;old economy&quot; industries which can be expected not to participate in the
<BR>
increased growth rates, and that rising interest rates will hurt the
<BR>
prices of these stocks.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Caveat: as long as investors haven't started to notice these effects, it
<BR>
might be wiser to postpone agressive attempts to exploit these ideas.
