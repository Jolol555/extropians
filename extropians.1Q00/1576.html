<EM>&gt;Similarly, if a market said a given treaty made war more likely the treaty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could not be approved on the justification that it would keep us out of war,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought it might be approved on other justifications.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;The natural response of those who negotiated the treaty would be that they
<BR>
have nonpublic information which is better than the market's information.
<BR>
&nbsp;I said on another list (on the subject of corporate board decisions):
<BR>
<EM>      &gt;Many board members could answer this by claiming to have had too
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;little capital to fix it. Or, at least in the forseeable future, claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;to believe that such insider trading is unfair. This attitude seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>      &gt;sufficiently widespread that I don't see how it can be fully eliminated.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;To which you responded:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case, we might expect them to publicly declare their
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;best estimate, and to bet a lot for it.  If speculators don't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;believe them and move the price to their estimate, I think it
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasonable to say the decision should go with the market estimate,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not with what the board says is its estimate.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;In the case of treaties, I suspect that negotiators will find some hard-to
<BR>
-analyze argument for secrecy (based on ethical problems with insider trading
<BR>
and/or on the desire to prevent other nations from knowing how badly our
<BR>
government wants the treaty).
<BR>
&nbsp;A more achievable goal for using idea futures would be to have an open
<BR>
market for estimating which political party or presidential candidate would
<BR>
best minimize the risk of war, and then have private markets for those with
<BR>
inside information to estimate the effects of individual decisions such as
<BR>
treaties.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;3) Choose some official national objective function, something like GDP,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only more carefully measured and trying to include more contributions like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the value of leisure, etc.  Have some independent and well monitored agency
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continually update this estimate of the state of the nation.  Then have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rule be that decision D must be enacted whenever a market says that among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all the decisions markets are considering (including letting policy makers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do what they want), D gives the highest conditional estimate for this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;national objective.  I think this is the most promising approach.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;Given the problems experts have agreeing on how to quantify relatively
<BR>
well understood things like inflation, I wouldn't expect much agreement
<BR>
about how to quantify something for which you don't even have a name.
<BR>
I'd expect that measuring the value of unowned things like Linux or
<BR>
whales would be more subject to political manipulation.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I don't think a single official measure is wise. I'd prefer to use a
<BR>
handfull of different measures (an economic growth indicator, an inequality
<BR>
indicator, a leisure indicator, etc.).
