<P>Well, yes it does.  Folks have been working on this for quite some time,
<BR>
including me.  The trick is to get the material produced by thin film methods,
<BR>
and patterned onto MEMS devices.  There is a company that does this, and you can
<BR>
read all about it at:

<P>As part of a project for one of my customers in the nanotech development world,
<BR>
I have been working with this company to develop actuators small enough to
<BR>
handle molecules.  The first proof of feasibility paper has been sent to NASA
<BR>
for publication, and we have applied for funding to develop working prototypes.
<BR>
I will let you know when publication happens.
<BR>
<P>A big question is how small a crystal of alloy can be fabricated that still has
<BR>
usable lattice transition properties.  We have shown it is fine down to the
<BR>
micron range, and suspect that it will be good down to a lattice of a few tens
<BR>
of atoms, but we do not really know.  I will be quite happy with results on the
<BR>
100 nm scale.  With mussels this size, I can attach rigid structures that have
<BR>
working points down in the 10 nm range, which is small enough to move large
<BR>
molecular building blocks around.  The goal is to produce the worlds smallest
<BR>
robot hands, to help develope the first nanotechnology assemblers.  (After
<BR>
which, of course, they go on the junk pile.)
