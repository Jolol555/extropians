<P>
&lt;&lt; Hot sex however has connatations of
<BR>
&nbsp;sad old salary men addicted to internet porn - and I being thought to be of
<BR>
&nbsp;that ilk is slightly embarrasing. I certainly don't want to be put into a
<BR>
&nbsp;position of having to convince my kids that I'm not a sad old wanker. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>If an e-mail would lead the family  to that conclusion, communication needs 
<BR>
to be stepped up, dad...
<BR>
<P>As porn acitivist, I have to say again, that's sad...  I watch porn.
<BR>
Anyway EVEN if it was a spam about porn... porn... porn.... I get thousands!
<BR>
Who cares?You let something that simple hold that much power over you? \
<BR>
<P>Man, this whole thing, it's antithesis of freedom... nothing wrong with 
<BR>
sex... lots wrong with subverting it... lots wrong with pretending it's not 
<BR>
in your mailbox or on all over the net...
<BR>
<P>hey! Get a load of that guy who doesn't like the word sex, but still wants to 
<BR>
*have sex* as long as he  has a lofty bunch of words that explain WHY it isnt 
<BR>
sex! 
<BR>
<P><P>What exactly is wrong with Hot Sex? 
<BR>
Yikes, I feel like I'm in the Middle Ages and this is supposed to be a 
<BR>
FUTURIST list..
