<P><EM>&gt; But would we really learn then in an abstract and non-feeling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simulator?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would hope we could find a way to do it better than what
<BR>
occurs now.  I simply don't see why people are so insistent that there
<BR>
can't be some better way.  Why are people so quick to give up hope?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Will evil/injustice ever be totally eliminated?  I seriously doubt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that but it would be nice.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you go! YES! &quot;it would be nice&quot;!  That's the best anyone
<BR>
can do: &quot;seriously doubt&quot; that something so great is really possible.
<BR>
But even with &quot;seriously doubt&quot; there is still a small chance that
<BR>
just maybe, even if only a 1 in a million chance, some day, some way,
<BR>
people far into the future could find or discover some way to do all
<BR>
this.  What is wrong with hoping, planning, and striving in this
<BR>
direction forever or until it is possible?  What's wrong with hoping
<BR>
there isn't yet all powerful Gods, and that thereby all evil could
<BR>
possibly, even if only after working at it for billions of years, be
<BR>
completely overcome?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A french scientist of yesteryear said that Christ would return
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before humanity discovered all the keys to open the doors to all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; God's secrets, which would lead to our own destruction due to human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nature.  We will see...
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there really is a &quot;Christ&quot; and such a very powerful &quot;God&quot;,
<BR>
out their hiding, and this is proven by an event such as Christ's
<BR>
return from hiding, then that will be proof that nothing better than
<BR>
all the evil we now know is possible.  For if that all powerful God
<BR>
can't do or be any better, no matter how much we achieve, we also,
<BR>
will not be able to do any better.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't much know what the odds are of a second coming, but I
<BR>
know what I am hoping for and what I will forever strive for.
<BR>
