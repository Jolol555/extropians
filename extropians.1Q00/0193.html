<EM>&gt; When they do, don't forget assisted suicide as a plank in the Extropian

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the US public. It's a natural.

<P>This was the point of my &quot;Message&quot; exactly. Does membership in this group
<BR>
commit me to the support of what some fraction of current Extropians happen
<BR>
to espouse?  I see no relevance in the mention of public opinion. Suppose
<BR>
95% of the American people favored the national legalization of euthanasia,
<BR>
assisted or otherwise, and further suppose that 51% of the Extropian
<BR>
membership was of the same persuasion.  So what?  If I happen to feel
<BR>
strongly opposed to it, do you honestly feel I hold this view on statistical
<BR>
grounds, so that I will be dissuaded by the force of mere numbers?
<BR>
<P>When I joined this group, there was no understanding that I was appointing
<BR>
it my proxy or my public ideological representative, authorized to speak for
<BR>
me on social and political issues.
<BR>
<P>Finally, shouldn't that be &quot;Transhumanist/Extropian?
