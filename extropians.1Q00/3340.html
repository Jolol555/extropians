Hello All,
<BR>
<P>I'm a long-time lurker, first time poster, who wanted to get in on this
<BR>
discussion. At 22, I'm sort of between the dot.rich.kids and their parents'
<BR>
generation. I agree that technology and affluence has increased the
<BR>
generation gap, and that it's hard to impart values when many old values are
<BR>
irrelevant.  But I think there are three things all parents should do. The
<BR>
first is to teach their kids that change is constant and inevitable, because
<BR>
these kids are going to see lots of change. The second is to nurture
<BR>
creativity, through a wide range of experiences, because these kids will
<BR>
need to be resourceful. The third is to nurture individuality, and let the
<BR>
kids develop using their resources (including monetary). But despite these
<BR>
lofty goals, I wonder how much influence parents even have over
<BR>
dot.rich.kids. With both parents working, independent wealth and access to
<BR>
an increasing amount of information, how large a role are parents playing in
<BR>
shaping these kids? How much does it matter what the parents do, beyond
<BR>
providing the basic necessities?
<BR>
<P>Of course, I'm sure I'll be less cynical IF (&lt;--big if) and when I have
<BR>
children.
<BR>
<P>Simon Smith
