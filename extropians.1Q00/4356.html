<EM>&gt;Zero, how can you know or have confidence that you will never ever &gt;get 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bored as long as you have fresh questions to answer?  You may &gt;get fatigued 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the questioning, the endless searching? But its a &gt;big universe to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;learnn about and inhabit, so maybe the race goes to &gt;the curious?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, as with any prediction of the future, I can only extrapolate from 
<BR>
present conditions.  I have only been alive 37 years and, due in large part 
<BR>
to my voracious curiosity, I have rarely if ever suffered from any prolonged 
<BR>
period of boredom (so long as I have had access to materials with which to 
<BR>
attempt to satisfy my curiosity--namely an interesting book or access to the 
<BR>
internet).  Now, I know its a bit presumptuous to try to predict the next 
<BR>
37,000 years based upon only the past 37, but given my present significant 
<BR>
cognitive and experiential limitations its the best I can do.
<BR>
<P>Maybe I'm wrong, but right now I believe that as long as there are 
<BR>
unanswered questions and access to the data which may yield answers to those 
<BR>
questions, I'll always have something to do which will hold my interest, 
<BR>
i.e. I will not be bored.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;To infinity and beyond!&quot;
