<P>Nope- I have Netscrape 4.7 and it's the web designer's problem, not
<BR>
yours. I think ve wanted to replicate the look of a newspaper, but
<BR>

disabled!  Maybe he can get a patent on that...

<P>To read munged-up pages like this, you might select &quot;Open in Editor&quot;,
<BR>
and this forces everything to show within normal screen width.
