I walked past a woman in the metro tonight. She had one young child standing 
<BR>
beside her and another infant in her arms. The arm holding  the infants head 
<BR>
ended in an outstretched palm. At the end of the passage was a seemingly 
<BR>
talented flutist playing not sad, but not happy tunes. I noticed a 10 ruble 
<BR>
(~$.30) note in his flute case. Whom should I have helped -- both, neither? 
<BR>
I really don't know anymore.

If it doesn't break your bank, both. My childhood, was full of hardships, 
<BR>
and although, I live quite the opposite spectrum now, I will never forget: 
<BR>
genuine need. Now I have a sponsored child, retrieved a dog from the humane 
<BR>
society, things that keep me earthbound, and true to all facets of myself.

That is part of what I wanted to say to Robert in reply to the same post, 
<BR>
Gina. It is all, as you, suggest, full of para-dox and ambivalence. But it 
<BR>
is Robert's final sentence that for me was so full of pathos. I really want 
<BR>
to know why it is we don't know? Thank you for bringing your resolution to 
<BR>
my attention,
<BR>

<BR>
<P>I can understand how a person could suffer from compassion fatigue in a 
<BR>
society as troubled as Russia is at present.  Even in an American city this 
<BR>
can be a common problem.  Like Gina, if I could afford to at that time I 
<BR>
would try to help both even if only with small amounts of money.  Of course 
<BR>
that could be more to assuage a troubled conscience then to really turn 
<BR>
around their lives.  If I had to choose between them I would help the mother 
<BR>
with two children.  Of course we know the sociological reasons for a choice 
<BR>
like this.
<BR>
<P>I admire Gina for sponsoring a child.  Even as a poor college student I 
<BR>
could scrape the money ($20 a month) together to do it if I were really 
<BR>
intent on making a difference.  I have read how such programs over the 
<BR>
longterm hurt poor nations in that they add to overpopulation and its 
<BR>
adverse affects.
<BR>
<P>But thinking of &quot;population die-off&quot; in regards to human children gives me 
<BR>
chills.  The children that &quot;are here&quot; must not when at all possible suffer 
<BR>
the fate so many do from disease, malnutrition and lack of education.  If 
<BR>
only these poor nations got the resources to provide adequate birth control, 
<BR>
education and employment.
<BR>
<P>Far less important then a child but still a life, is a scruffy alley cat 
<BR>
that lives in my retired parents neighborhood.  Alaska in the winter is not 
<BR>
a good place for cats living on their own.  Every night my folks feed this 
<BR>
feline who knows to wait outside in the evening.  They even have to watch 
<BR>
over him as he eats because local foxes got in the habit of stealing his 
<BR>
food.  It's only a cat but my folks get a good feeling from looking out for 
<BR>
him and he gets a needed calories to not freeze to death.
<BR>
<P>I was impressed when Max More put forward the idea of having extro members 
<BR>
give to the microloan program that aids third world people.  We can't save 
<BR>
everyone but we can each do something.
<BR>
