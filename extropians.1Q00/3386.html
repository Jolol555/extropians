You're arguing that it is possible for cryonics arrangements to fall 
<BR>
through. Well, DUH. No system is 100% reliable. But your odds of actually 
<BR>
getting suspended if you are signed up are very high.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>You didn't quite understand the point I was making.  I am fully aware that 
<BR>
cryonics arrangements can fail.  I was not meaning when for legal or 
<BR>
financial reasons a suspension does not happen.
<BR>
<P>I was talking about how suspension is not so promising when the body has had 
<BR>
extended time to decay(hours and days, especially)  I agree that cancer and 
<BR>
auto accidents are more threatening to me then the odds of heart attack or 
<BR>
stroke where no one is there to help.  BUT, it is a possibility.  I don't 
<BR>
want any of us to be the exception to the rule!
<BR>
<P>Of course with new technologies like the lifeshirt, we can be much more 
<BR>
confident that even this possibility can be dealt with.  And by the time we 
<BR>
are old and in the &quot;prime years&quot; for such threats, this technology will be 
<BR>
much cheaper and refined.
<BR>
<P>I have done my homework in terms of reading about cryonics and discussing it 
<BR>
with leaders in the field.  Even prominent cryonicists can be surprisingly 
<BR>
negative about the odds.  But something is better then nothing and those 
<BR>
odds should improve as time goes by.  Again, I want the highest quality 
<BR>
suspension I can get.  I'll try to make it a little easier on those future 
<BR>
doctors and technicians! :)
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
