<EM>&gt; Second, with emergency medicine improving all the time, the circumstances

</EM><BR>
<P>I'd go a lot further than this.  First off, accidents that destroy the brain
<BR>
are fairly rare, so even if you die young your odds of getting a
<BR>
halfway-decent suspension are pretty good.  It is pretty hard to die in a
<BR>
way that prevents your body from arriving at a hospital within an hour or
<BR>
less - just don't get yourself killed while you're off camping in the middle
<BR>
of nowhere.
<BR>
<P>Second, and more important, most people have an excessively narrow view of
<BR>
what constitutes an adequate suspension.  Remember, if cryonics patients are
<BR>
ever revived at all, that means we're positing nanotech advanced enough to
<BR>
repair any kind of physical damage.  The only thing that matters in that
<BR>
situation is whether the information that defines your memories and
<BR>
personality can be recovered from your brain tissue.
<BR>
<P>Now, what people tend to overlook is that the problem of deducing the
<BR>
original information content of a scrambled brain is isomorphic to the
<BR>
problem of deducing the information content of an encrypted message.  Given
<BR>
modern cryptographic techniques and abundant computing power, that means
<BR>
that no non-random form of damage can prevent a successful revival.  A
<BR>
completely random encryption is unbreakable, and so is a completely random
<BR>
source of damage.  However, very few types of physical injury produce truly
<BR>
random changes at the molecular level.  If the history of cryptography is
<BR>
any guide, we should expect that even the most subtle kinds of regularity
<BR>
can be used to reverse the effects of even the most radical perturbations.
<BR>
<P>What does this all mean in English?  Basically, that burning your brain
<BR>
destroys information, but dropping a rock on it doesn't.  Most of the damage
<BR>
sources that cryonicists agonize over, like freezing damage and ischemic
<BR>
injury, are very regular in nature and hence should be very easy to reverse.
<BR>
So, your odds of getting an adequate suspension are very high no matter how
<BR>
you end up dying.
