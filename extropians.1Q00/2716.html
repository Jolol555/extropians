Dear Friends,
<BR>
<P>Please distribute this memo widely and ask your family and friends to
<BR>
visit <A HREF="http://www.forfeiture.org">http://www.forfeiture.org</A> as soon as possible. Thanks!
<BR>
<P>As you may know, historic forfeiture reform legislation has passed in
<BR>
the U.S. House of Representatives (H.R. 1658) and is now pending in
<BR>
the U.S. Senate (S. 1931).
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, S. 1931 is in danger of stalling in the Senate. If it
<BR>
doesn't pass this year, then it's back to square one when the next
<BR>
Congress convenes in January 2001.
<BR>
<P>Incredible as it may seem, current law allows federal agents to
<BR>
take your property without convicting you of -- or even charging you
<BR>
with -- a crime. (Under current law, government agents can seize your
<BR>
property if they believe there is &quot;probable cause&quot; that the property
<BR>
was used in a crime. Then, to get your property back, you must prove
<BR>
that your property is &quot;innocent&quot;!)
<BR>
<P>In 85% of federal asset forfeiture cases, the owner of the property is
<BR>
never charged with a crime, yet government officials can -- and
<BR>
usually do -- keep the seized property for their own use. This is
<BR>
nothing short of &quot;legal theft.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Please write to your two U.S. senators and ask them to vote for
<BR>
S. 1931 which, among other things, would require the government to
<BR>
prove that property was used to commit a crime before it can be
<BR>
forfeited.
<BR>
<P>Would you please visit <A HREF="http://www.forfeiture.org">http://www.forfeiture.org</A> as soon as possible?
<BR>
A national coalition of prestigious organizations has come together to
<BR>
support forfeiture reform in Congress, but we will not be able to pass
<BR>
S. 1931 unless your two U.S. senators hear from you and your friends,
<BR>
colleagues, and family.
<BR>
<P>With the click of a couple of buttons, you can send a pre-written
<BR>
letter to your two U.S. senators in less than two minutes. Thank you!

<P>Please visit <A HREF="http://www.forfeiture.org">http://www.forfeiture.org</A> as soon as possible to send a
<BR>
letter of support to your two U.S. senators. Time is of the essence.

<BR>
<P>When is the Senate Judiciary Committee expected to vote on S. 1931?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FEBRUARY 24
