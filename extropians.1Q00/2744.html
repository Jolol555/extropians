<P>&lt;&lt; I like it but I don't think it'll work.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Points in favour: Torvald's law applies (&quot;given an infinite number of
<BR>
&nbsp;eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&quot;) to spotting hazards.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Points against:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;* It's vulnerable to special interest groups trashing someone's project
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for irrational reasons. (Consider the current mess over GM crops in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EU for an instance of this sort of thing.)&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>This problem could be addressed in part by increasing the percentage 
<BR>
necessary to veto a project.  If 51% or more of the population veto a 
<BR>
project, then it is no longer a special interest group.  Note, however, that 
<BR>
this does nothing to stop irrational decisions from being made.  To do that, 
<BR>
you must make changes in the way people think and feel about issues, not in 
<BR>
the way the voting system is structured.  However, I do believe by having it 
<BR>
be a veto system instead of a positive vote, small projects will have a 
<BR>
better chance of going forward, since the burden to act is now on those who 
<BR>
would oppose the design.  This will likely allow people to follow their own 
<BR>
personal projects as long as they do not adversely effect others.  On the 
<BR>
other hand, with a positive vote of approval being necessary to go forward, 
<BR>
anyone who wishes to go forward with a design will have to give people a 
<BR>
compelling reason why they should bother to vote for their project.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&lt;&lt;* It's vulnerable to an effective denial of service attack. If you want
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to smuggle a bad design through, simply hit the approvals mechanism with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about ten million spurious design requests, all generated by making
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;variations off some core structure. This will overload the people
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;monitoring the designs, leading to designs being passed by default without 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough people checking them. (You could work around this by making
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;submitting a design a chargable expense, like filing for a patent, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then you end up saddling the nascent nanotech design industry with 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a very artificial cost structure and force legitimate inventors to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subsidize bull-goose loonies.)&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Or you could try to come up with a reasonable limit to how many designs one 
<BR>
person can submit in a period of time and/or a limit to how many total 
<BR>
designs may be submitted to the public for approval at any one time.  This 
<BR>
second strategy could be combined with having monitors go through the list of 
<BR>
designs waiting for approval and flag any irregularities in patterns of 
<BR>
people sending them (overloading the system) or throw out clearly fraudulent 
<BR>
designs (these would remain in a public domain file for oversight by the 
<BR>
general population).  These approaches would slow the rate of design 
<BR>
implementation, but this might be offset in part by decentralizing the 
<BR>
process and having local populations deal with local designs.  You might then 
<BR>
also incorporate some appeals process where if someone (or a sizable 
<BR>
minority?) is concerned about a decision it could be sent out to the entire 
<BR>
population for review.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&lt;&lt;* It's inimical to the currently understood concept of a patent -- in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect, it gives your business competitors an opportunity to veto your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;best inventions, rather than protecting them. I'm no fan of the current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patent system, but I think this is going rather too far in the opposite
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;direction!&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Again, if we keep the percent necessary for a veto above the majority level, 
<BR>
this will be somewhat offset as most business competitors will not likely be 
<BR>
a majority of your population.  This becomes more of a problem with a 
<BR>
decentralized voting system since I can see some &quot;company towns&quot;, but again, 
<BR>
an appeals process could be in place to offset that by kicking it up to the 
<BR>
general population.  Or you could simply move to a more friendly community 
<BR>
that wouldn't mind having a business in their area competing with that other 
<BR>
area's business&lt;g&gt;. 
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&lt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>Are they ever easy&lt;fg&gt;?  Thanks for your critiques, they were good points.
