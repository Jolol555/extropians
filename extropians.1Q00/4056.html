<EM>&gt;I want an uploading process that actually takes my brain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and transforms it into a form of energy without any loss to the &gt;authentic

<EM>&gt;me.

I could be wrong but I don't think pure energy alone can retain complex 
<BR>
information. To me one chunk of pure energy is the same as any other.

<BR>
<P>As I wrote the original post I wondered about that myself.  Does anyone have 
<BR>
an answer(at least conjecture) on that?  Despite all we presently know, the 
<BR>
technology I desire may be possible eventually but simply totally beyond 
<BR>
what we can solidly hypothesize about at present.

The point is if the mind or soul were &quot;vital&quot; no amount of damage to the 
<BR>
brain could affect behavior. We know it does.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>I believe a soul exists from a theological standpoint and that the flesh is 
<BR>
dominant, so while in this world physical injury causes physical limitation.

The problem with uploading as I see it is the term &quot;upload&quot;. It gives the 
<BR>
impression the data and not the pattern can be moved or copied.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>I agree. I think alot of people have gotten their impression of uploading 
<BR>
from films like &quot;The Lawnmower Man.&quot; lol  Which does happen to be one of my 
<BR>
favorite films.
<BR>
<P>I look forward to seeing what others have to say about the key matter you 
<BR>
brought up regarding uploading.  It should make for interesting reading.
