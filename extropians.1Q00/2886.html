<P>
As usual, I have limited time to write during the week.  Therefore, I will be 
<BR>
mercifully brief in addressing the questions that have been raised in this 
<BR>
thread.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  The &quot;gun ban&quot; WAS a temporary measure, undertaken with great reluctance 
<BR>
by ExI as the sponsor of this list.  It was instituted to address what had 
<BR>
become a pointless posting of an unreasonable number of messages that had 
<BR>
come to contain an unacceptably high level of personalistic attacks and 
<BR>
offensive language.  The temporary moratorium had NOTHING to do with the 
<BR>
subject matter and EVERYTHING to do with the way that the list was being 
<BR>
abused.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;  EvMick, as ExI's officer charged with enforcing that temporary policy, I 
<BR>
was required to &quot;unsubscribe&quot; you when you 1) failed to observe the temporary 
<BR>
moratorium on gun discussions and 2) failed to reply to my private 
<BR>
correspondence on the matter.  I am certain that the reason for this was the 
<BR>
irregular nature of your contact with the net in the first instance, and a 
<BR>
full mailbox in the second.  Although I therefore had good reason to believe 
<BR>
your transgression was completely unintentional, I had no choice but to 
<BR>
enforce the terms of the moratorium against you.  I was sorry to do so and am 
<BR>
glad you're back on the list.
<BR>
<P>&lt;&gt; We have had some extremely high quality discussion on the this list in the 
<BR>
last couple of years.  This is primarily because we have a lot of really 
<BR>
smart people on the list who value it as a resource and have the good 
<BR>
judgment to use it wisely.  As always, we are each of us dependent on the 
<BR>
common sense of other posters to maintain this quality environment.  Please 
<BR>
use good judgment in maintaining the value of the list.
<BR>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We never stop investigating. We are never satisfied that we know 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to get by. Every question we answer leads on to another    
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;question. This has become the greatest survival trick of our species.&quot;
