<EM>&gt;&gt; Ian Goddard
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;&gt; Happy New Year 2000!!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; 366 more days till the New Millennium!!!
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; *warning: useless argument inevitable*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some (inc. me) have argued this, but what's the use?
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately, talking about this at all now only results in dismissive 
<BR>
criticism and reactions of the sort that Mike has offered.  Many of you may 
<BR>
consider that anyone daring to challenge the idea that the millennium begins 
<BR>
today is only dragging out a completely trivial and &quot;useless&quot; argument.
<BR>
<P>I will be brief.  And I will try to relate a seemingly inconsequential point 
<BR>
to broader matters of interest in the hopes of maintaining the attention of 
<BR>
those who are still reading.
<BR>
<P>If the Gregorian calendar actually began in year 1 then the third millennium 
<BR>
does begin in 2001.  That is a fact.  No further debate is necessary.
<BR>
<P>People apparently know this.  A few months ago people were still discussing it 
<BR>
in public.  But it quite disturbs me that, by popular demand (facilitated by 
<BR>
constant repetition and assertion in every medium), an indisputable fact was 
<BR>
changed.  Now it is the third millennium.  Mentioning the logical objection 
<BR>
will do nothing to change that.  In fact, saying otherwise invites charges of 
<BR>
being a hopeless purist, nitpicker, or, worst of all, a party-pooper.
<BR>
<P>This should disturb you as well.  Do you really have no problem with the fact 
<BR>
that everyone in the world, apparently, intentionally ignored a basic fact?  
<BR>
How many journalists and news anchors have to say something before you accept 
<BR>
it?
<BR>
<P>Sure, the date is a social fact, not a scientific one.  The Gregorian calendar 
<BR>
was invented and is used by consensus in the first place.  (And some of us, 
<BR>
myself included, don't even want it or any system based on a mythology.  A 
<BR>
metric date/time system, in which seconds are simply counted and grouped, 
<BR>
would be much better.)
<BR>
<P>But social facts, whether we like or care about them or not, still affect us.  
<BR>
So it's fine that to the general public &quot;hacker&quot; now means &quot;cracker&quot;, despite 
<BR>
the resistance to that usage by many hackers themselves.  It's fine that &quot;free 
<BR>
software&quot; can have nothing to do with source code.  It's fine that enough 
<BR>
Luddite activists can impede work in genengineering or cloning.  It's fine 
<BR>
that evolution is &quot;just a theory&quot; and therefore ignorable, at least in some 
<BR>
U.S. school systems.  It's fine that certain facts can change if enough 
<BR>
newsmedia, money, uninformed banter, advertisements, corporations, activists, 
<BR>
or governments want it to.  &quot;What's the use?&quot;  The use is to exercise and 
<BR>
maintain rational, critical thought.
<BR>
<P>I am not disputing the fact that expressions of ideas and meanings of words 
<BR>
can change.  Why they change, who changes them, and what happens as a result 
<BR>
is another question entirely.  You've heard it before and, if you're still 
<BR>
reading, you're hearing it again.  It's not just about the date, as many of us 
<BR>
here who are watching transhumanist ideas reaching and even taking hold within 
<BR>
the public mind realize.
<BR>
<P><P>All right; enough.  Back to the real future, which all of us here are 
<BR>
manufacturing every day by individually and together exploring the visions and 
<BR>
ideas we share.
