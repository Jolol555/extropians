<EM>&gt; What stumbles occured with nuclear power? Even counting Chernobyl (more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a result of socialism than nuclear technology) and the two bombs dropped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Japan there are still fewer people killed by nuclear technology in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its entire history than are killed every year by the pollution of coal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burning technology, and coal burning plants put more radioactive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; materials into the environment every day than the entire US nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry has released in its history. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Remember &quot;electricity too cheap to meter&quot;? Possibly not, as that was
<BR>
rhetoric used in the UK to promote nuclear power in the 1950's.
<BR>
<P>Nuclear electricity was grossly oversold because when the second
<BR>
generation reactors were being introduced -- the first post-military
<BR>
generation -- they were installed without any thought about decomissioning
<BR>
costs. In some cases (e.g. the USSR) they were installed without
<BR>
any disaster planning -- as witness the RBMK reactors built with no
<BR>
containment vessels. (If Chernobyl had been equipped with a western-style
<BR>
containment vessel, the accident would have caused no consequences worse
<BR>
than Three Mile Island.)
<BR>
<P>To make matters worse, civilian reactors were based on military designs;
<BR>
for example, the PWRs used in the west were originally based on scaled-up
<BR>
naval propulsion reactors. This means essentially we have lightweight
<BR>
high performance reactors, not reactors optimized for (a) safety, (b)
<BR>
economical operation, and (c) easy decommissioning. (I'm inclined to
<BR>
ascribe this to the fact that most nuclear developments were government-
<BR>
led from the start, except that without government intervention it's hard
<BR>
to conceive of a commercial entity building the damn things in the first
<BR>
place.)
<BR>
<P>The upshot is that nuclear reactors today are a bit like space launchers
<BR>
-- hyper-evolved military spin-offs, expensive, powerful, but unreliable
<BR>
and not really suitable for low-cost, safe, civilian use. The problem
<BR>
with this picture is that there is no nuclear equivalent of ROTON or
<BR>
Beal or Kistler on the horizon; because nuclear technology has strategic
<BR>
military implications, no government is going to let some bunch of 
<BR>
eccentric whacko technology entrepreneurs reinvent it in a cheap, fast,
<BR>
and out-of-control format that can prove its merit on the open market.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; While some countries are shutting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down their nuclear plants, they are increasing output at their coal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plants, and are buring lower quality coal than ever before. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Or natural gas. In the UK, coal plants are being shut down and switched
<BR>
to methane-burning turbined at remarkable speed. Meanwhile, the nuclear
<BR>
industry is moribund.  The real exceptions are France and Japan, which
<BR>
for reasons of state policy are building potloads of nuclear reactors.
<BR>
By 2020, a much higher proportion of the UK's electricity will be nuclear
<BR>
than is the case today -- and it will be imported from France.
