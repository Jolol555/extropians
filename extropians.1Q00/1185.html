<P><EM>&gt; What makes human life special and worth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserving does not have anything to do with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; biological properties, it's our mental properties.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right: OUR mental properties, those of the discussants, not merely those of the
<BR>
life in question. Values aren't free-floating, they are HELD, they are values
<BR>
FOR particular people. My cats' lives are worth preserving mostly because of my
<BR>
mental properties, not my cats'. As my cats get more complicated, the &quot;mostly&quot;
<BR>
gets diminished, yes, but never eliminated.
<BR>
<P>[....]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Instead of pushing the valuation back towards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the younger end of the spectrum, it is probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much more rational to push it *ahead* to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; older end of the spectrum (though this flies in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the face of the emotional ties that soft wet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cuddly babies generate).
</EM><BR>
<P>Indeed, the characters &quot;Socrates&quot; and &quot;Glaucon&quot; in the
<BR>
philosophico-poetico-eugenic drama, _The Republic_, seem to make precisely that
<BR>
suggestion. [1]
<BR>
<P>[....]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; I remember reading about a controversial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; philosophy professor who has put forward the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; idea that children up to a certain time after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; birth should be  under &quot;probation&quot; as to whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; or not they are allowed to live by the  parents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; There have been protests at the college that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; recently hired him to try to kick him out. 
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Irrational people know no limits.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes indeed -- above all, those who call themselves purely rational know no
<BR>
limits, since they thereby forget that the very choice of rationality is itself
<BR>
irrational.
<BR>
<P>But still, I've always thought....
<BR>
<P>Oops Jehovah's Witnesses at the door. Gotta run.
<BR>
<P>Back to lurk mode,
<BR>
Brian.

My email was (mostly) down from ~1999.12.26 through
2000.01.02, and has been sporadic since then.
Things believed to have been sent to, or from me might
not have been. Sorry.
