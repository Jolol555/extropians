<P>
Well, there is the government.
<BR>
<P>What can we as individual citizens do, depending upon cause, among, for, or against the
<BR>
machinery of state?
<BR>
<P>First it is necessary to know what it is doing.  The government has its tendrils in most
<BR>
sectors of society.
<BR>
<P>The government is, in my opinion, more benign that not.  So, we turn to it to provide us
<BR>
information about it.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://ssdc.ucsd.edu/gpogate/budget00/">http://ssdc.ucsd.edu/gpogate/budget00/</A>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://w3.access.gpo.gov/usbudget/fy1999/maindown.html">http://w3.access.gpo.gov/usbudget/fy1999/maindown.html</A>
<BR>
<P>At the above locations are listed budget expenditure figures.  Of note, a high level of
<BR>
military spending.  I have downloaded many of these budget accounts and reviewed them.
<BR>
It is important to examine where Social Security funds are being spent.
<BR>
<P>One large organization collects taxes from the people:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.irs.gov/">http://www.irs.gov/</A>
<BR>
<P>The government (this note is in the frame of reference of the U.S.A.) has a series of
<BR>
laws pertaining to the public access to goverment operational and other data.  As
<BR>
discussed on this group, there are some exception for &quot;National Security&quot;.  In terms of
<BR>
these Acts, a web search yields beginning data:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&kl=XX&stype=stext&q=%22Freedom+of+Information+Act%22">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&kl=XX&stype=stext&q=%22Freedom+of+Information+Act%22</A>
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.fedworld.gov/">http://www.fedworld.gov/</A>
<BR>
<P>Then there is the historical and policy legislation.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://thomas.loc.gov/">http://thomas.loc.gov/</A>
<BR>
<P>Our legislators receive funding from a variety of sources.  There are guidelines in place
<BR>
as to how they are to receive and report donations to their campaign baskets.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.fec.gov/">http://www.fec.gov/</A>
<BR>
<P>So the government is willing to provide huge amounts of information, supposedly that
<BR>
which they are not rife to expose.  We can also turn to public watchdog groups to give us
<BR>
enlightenment towards understanding objectionable government actions.  Here are some, I
<BR>
vouch for them not:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&kl=XX&stype=stext&q=Government+watchdog">http://www.altavista.com/cgi-bin/query?pg=q&kl=XX&stype=stext&q=Government+watchdog</A>
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Now when there is a problem with the way the government is doing something, we must seek
<BR>
recourse.  There are constitutionally recognized methods of doing so.  A direct one is to
<BR>
contact your legislators and express your views:
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.senate.gov">http://www.senate.gov</A>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.whitehouse.gov">http://www.whitehouse.gov</A>
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.house.gov">http://www.house.gov</A>
<BR>
<P>A more indirect one is that of grassroots movement to garner weight to your statements to
<BR>
politicians.
<BR>
<P><A HREF="http://www.dogpile.com/texis/search?q=grassroots+organization&fs=web&to=thirty">http://www.dogpile.com/texis/search?q=grassroots+organization&fs=web&to=thirty</A>
<BR>
<P>I choose to examine more closely the first search result from AltaVista(C) search engine,
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.commoncause.org/">http://www.commoncause.org/</A>.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Common Cause supports improving the current system of electronic access to congressional
<BR>
documents by making available additional information, including timely availability of
<BR>
committee hearing and markup transcripts, testimony, Congressional Research Service
<BR>
reports, committee reports, lobbyist disclosure reports, and personal financial
<BR>
disclosure and office expense reports. &quot;
<BR>
<P>That sounds good to me.  Congress already has passed laws under Clinton to move all
<BR>
government agencies towards a &quot;paperless&quot; workplace.  We could examine those laws and
<BR>
their relative rates of enforcement for days on end.
<BR>
<P>One thing that I think about sometimes is the mining on federally owned lands.  I think
<BR>
that deserves investigation.
<BR>
<P>In the eighties, the defense contractors came under fire for $2,000 coffeepots.  Today,
<BR>
they charge the same for two hours of web development, without having to subcontract the
<BR>
coffeepot.
<BR>
<P>Well, that is my spiel.  As is my wont, I might later explode about privacy and other
<BR>
individual rights issues again.  Have a nice day,
<BR>

<EM>&gt;     &gt;I feel quite comfortable that  the defense lawyers were well funded and given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;adequate time to produce documents and edited video tapes, it's not my place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;to say if they were or not.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm not a lawyer so  I don't know or much care if the &quot;justice&quot; department's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actions against Microsoft were legal or not. I do know that the actions were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immoral and showed just as much intelligence as you'd expect from hack
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; politicians and civil servants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &gt;We Americans don't live in a completely socialist country
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fortunately that is true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &gt;it is not  completely capitalist either.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unfortunately that is true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;So then, if the government is to take some action, which it would be bound to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;upon ruling of antitrust violation sans rehabilitation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rehabilitation? Do you mean if they would only stop being so damn successful, if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would stop spending their own money so wisely,  if they would just stop making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products that people wanted to buy?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;       &gt;it should be to open it up  and &quot;level the playing field&quot;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's interesting, there are 3 common phrases that, although not offensive in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves,  have never, ever, been used in defense of anything I agreed with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The 3 are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1)Life is sacred.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2)you can't cry fire in a crowded movie theater.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 3)Level the playing field.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;The responses to this post mostly show a general sense of antipathy towards the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;government and specifically regulation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's because you're on the Extropian list and that's our thing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;The food  producers are regulated somewhat, so that all packaged foods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;have a list of ingredients and rudimentary nutrition information.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not needed. If people value such information then it's a good marketing tool
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and so the regulation is redundant, if they don't value it then the regulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is worthless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      &gt;Advertising is supposedly truthful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Government getting into the truth determining business makes me very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nervous, I'd rather do that little chore myself thank you very much.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;My opinion is that the people who pay to use this Windows to interoperate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;with the many others that use Windows have the right in cases to fully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;comprehend the functioning of this software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't see why they have that right, it's not what they bought. They knew, or they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should have know, that the software it was not open source, Microsoft never said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or even hinted that it was.
