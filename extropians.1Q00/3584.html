<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Share with us your methods to neurohack yourself!  I would like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; see just how different/same it is as compared to other cognitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enhancement techniques I am already familiar with.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If your interested, here's a neurohack I'd like to be able to
<BR>
do some day.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our brain has a fixed 3D space which is our conscious
<BR>
knowledge of the 3D space that surrounds us.  Our primary visual
<BR>
cortex some how produces a 3D model within this fixed space of what we
<BR>
are seeing.  As our eyes and head move around, changing the part of
<BR>
this fixed space our eyes are seeing, the model within the primary
<BR>
visual cortex pans around in this fixed 3D space.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This mechanism is what gives us conscious perception of a
<BR>
fixed world around us as our eyes scan within it.  Undoubtedly the
<BR>
inner ear is heavily used to maintain it's fixed stability as our eyes
<BR>
move.  Some evidence for this is the way this fixed space moves when
<BR>
the fluid in the semicircular canals is spinning or when we are
<BR>
dizzy.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, that is what we have today.  Here is the neurohack
<BR>
augmentation I'd like to some day achieve.  I'd like to have a second
<BR>
primary visual cortex integrated into this space.  I'd like to be able
<BR>
to monitor the data flowing through someone elses optical nerve, and
<BR>
use this as the data source for this second primary visual cortex.
<BR>
The entire system would have to have some complicated way, beyond just
<BR>
the inner ear, to map the data from both sets of eyes into the same
<BR>
fixed space, all within one consciousness, but surely such wouldn't be
<BR>
forever impossible.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I'd be aware of what I'm seeing, and at the same time,
<BR>
within the same space, be aware of what my partner was seeing.  If our
<BR>
eyes were close enough together, part of the imaged would fit together
<BR>
into a single image, just as usually occurs with our two eyes, more or
<BR>
less.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you imagine having this kind of link up with a sex
<BR>
partner?  And not only just a visual link, but also an entire body
<BR>
tactile merge with a complete representation of your partners body and
<BR>
what they are feeling in your consciousness?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only experience half the sexual experience is such a bummer!
<BR>
Wouldn't it be a trip to be able to experience it all!?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brent Allsop
