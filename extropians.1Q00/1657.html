<P>
Did my standard Spikish number last night at the local free Municipal
<BR>
Library, to a motley audience of 12 or 15. Several corpulent science
<BR>
fiction fans were in evidence, who looked at first like a support team if I
<BR>
started being heckled by the pensioners. Instead, 0ne of them, a youngish
<BR>
woman, soon began to mutter, smirk, roll her eyes and then declaim when we
<BR>
got to the AIs. The uploads took her over the edge. Her consort seemed
<BR>
slightly embarrassed by her fervor. 
<BR>
<P>All nonsense, she cried, you just want a world of soulless cyborgs. A
<BR>
computer can't do anything of its own accord, a computer can't have
<BR>
consciousness. Oh? Why not? *It's not alive! It can only do what it's
<BR>
programmed to do. I'm a sociologist! I'm a utilitarian! I'm a sociologist
<BR>
and I'm here to tell you that computers can't do anything unless they are
<BR>
programmed to do it.*  And so on. 
<BR>
<P>I mentioned that she was also programmed, by genes and culture, and she got
<BR>
highly indignant. I was trying to pretend she was a machine! She did things
<BR>
*just because she wanted to*! She'd broken away from the restrictions of
<BR>
her social upbringing etc etc. Not very much, you haven't, I said, and her
<BR>
face swelled attractively. No, I said, what I mean is... you're speaking
<BR>
English now, aren't you? You're wearing clothing not unlikely the garments
<BR>
we all wear. I see no Zulu hat upon your head. 
<BR>
<P>By this point I suppose I was patently a tool of hell, except that
<BR>
presumably she didn't actually believe in hell or souls, just in `life'. I
<BR>
went sideways. Suppose we insert a very thin tube into a person's head and
<BR>
replace a single neuron with a-- Ah, yes, you'd like to do that, wouldn't
<BR>
you, your type!  Chop people's brains up, turn them into machines without
<BR>
souls. No, hang on, let's say you just did this with a mouse-- I could see
<BR>
her delighted confirmation as my gleeful robotic cruelty to our dumb animal
<BR>
brethren was shamelessly revealed. And so on. Altogether frustrating,
<BR>
because presumably she wasn't stupid or unimaginative (she read some sort
<BR>
of sf, after all). It was a salutary experience, giving me some sense of
<BR>
what the *real* opposition might be like, out there in the world in its
<BR>
teeming blithering bigoted billions. Urp.
<BR>
<P>Damien (not a sociologist)
