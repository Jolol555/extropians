<P>The chiefest fallacy in criticising photovoltaics, is the assumption

that one needs extra land, and that land will be unavailable for other

purposes.

<P>In urban areas (where also most energy is consumed), the bulk of the
<BR>
surface is paved with dumb heat absorbers. The idea is to use roofs,
<BR>
facades, and free standing panels in already developed areas, with
<BR>
some additional areas at city periphery, and maybe extensive areas in
<BR>
the deserts (where the shading and the local abundance of energy can
<BR>
be utilized for raising crops on hitherton nonfertile ground).
<BR>
<P>Also, this does not include microwaved power from a fleet of
<BR>
photovoltaics satellites, built and launched by the kiloton in
<BR>
automatic lunar factories.
