<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The hordes of new internet millionaires throwing their money away to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the usual charities represent a new philanthropic impulse than we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;channel to important extropian research.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is of interest to me, since I'm one of the folks working hard in the hopes 
<BR>
of ending up on the list of Internet millionaires (why do I suspect I am not 
<BR>
the only one on this list?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;(1) A clearinghouse for important, underfunded science.  People could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;go to a web site, find appealing science and make donations.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;organization would be a middle man making it very easy for both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;philanthropists and scientists to use the site and provide the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;non-profit&quot; legal status needed for tax purposes, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>A friend of mine recently made a suggestion to me that we might consider going 
<BR>
into this buisiness (although he was thinking that it should support as many 
<BR>
charities as possible, suitably categorized). What do folks think of the 
<BR>
viability of this idea?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;(2) A foundation that raises money and distributes it according to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;its board's decisions.  This is a turn-key solution for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;philanthropist; he can write a check, feel good and forget about it.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are any number of philianthropic foundations set up like this. The 
<BR>
difficulty is ensuring that the vision of the board of directors stays 
<BR>
optimistic and eager to embrace new technology, while having enough technical 
<BR>
savvy not to be taken in by things like 'collapsed hydrogen'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;(3) An philanthropic incubator or venture fund.  This is perhaps the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;most novel idea.  People will not be giving away their money, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;will be making an investment in a good thing that might or might not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pay off.  The problem with this is that you may have to focus more on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;profits in some cases than you'd like.  The benefit is a potentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;huge endowment through the IPOs of some of the ventures.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is the idea that I have been leaning towards. I'm just enough of a 
<BR>
Libertarian that I think that most charities could be better replaced by 
<BR>
institutions that make investments in the infrastructures that charities merely 
<BR>
prop up. In a similar manner, if I'm going to give money to strangers, I would 
<BR>
like to think that there *might* be a profit in it somewhere. Still, we all 
<BR>
know how being profit centered can stifle innovation, so I curious to see if 
<BR>
anyone on this list have any ideas on how to provide scientists the freedom to 
<BR>
fail, while being able to capitalize on any successes.
