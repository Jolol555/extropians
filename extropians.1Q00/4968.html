From: Dana Hedberg &lt;<A HREF="mailto:dah@signalinteractive.com?Subject=Re:%20[GUNS]%20Re:%20What%20are%20the%20reasons%20for%20killing?&In-Reply-To=&lt;200003151531.HAA08133@well.com&gt;">dah@signalinteractive.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The reasons behind the second case occurring seem to involve a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lack of education or incapable mental hardware that can not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;understand the consequences of these actions. These are the cases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;where it seems likely that safety mechanisms should be targeted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Education can only go so far within the mind sets of these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals.
</EM><BR>
<P>Gun Safety, and gun safety education have always been a primary
<BR>
goal of the NRA, along with personnal responsibility for gun
<BR>
ownership.
<BR>
<P>Gun ownership means that they are safely locked away when you are
<BR>
not at home or when children are around. Some good friends of
<BR>
mine's father was a Chicago Firefighter, his motto was that there
<BR>
was nothing dumber than an unloaded gun, there was a loaded gun
<BR>
under every bed in the house. When they were teenagers just about
<BR>
every weekend during the summer their house was crowded with guests
<BR>
of all kinds. Most people  were aware of the situation. Not once
<BR>
was there an incident of any kind. Why? Because everyone knew you
<BR>
risked ostracism, plus a personnal asskicking.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;The first case is much harder to deal with. We can separate these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;events into a few, related, but different categories. A]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Assassination B] Criminal intent (i.e., mugging or robbery) C]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Killing spree.  These are by no means exhaustive, but I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;capture the majority of gun deaths/injuries (at least in the US).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, now the question becomes what are the person's reasons for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;doing the above acts and how can we work to eliminate or &quot;fix&quot; it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such that this will not occur? 
</EM><BR>
<P>The anti-gunners have a habit of being disingenuous if not outright
<BR>
dishonest. They clearly play &quot;the ends justify the means&quot;. A
<BR>
perfect example is the fact that they have always lumped suicides
<BR>
in as gun related crimes to inflate the numbers.
