<EM>&gt; &gt;Why can't one walk three blocks in their normal swimsuit from the Charles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;River to Harvard Square?  This is such a simple thing!  As long as this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is totally unacceptable, how can you expect acceptance of free play
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;with really serious genetic and physical modifications?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The more I hear about the bizarre restrictions in the Land of the Free, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happier I am that I'm living in Oz. Can't be certain, but I'm fairly sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you could stroll in a swimsuit or a feathered chickensuit or a giant
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>What if your normal swimsuit were no swimsuit at all?
<BR>
<P>....
<BR>
<EM>&gt; If you chanced to be in Sydney during Gay &amp; Lesbian Mardi Gras, you'd be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; joshed for *not* wearing gold lame arseless panties, inflatable bra and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wings, and glittery tiara, or full traditional nun's habit and bushy beard,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while strolling down the centre of the road. Do they do that in Harvard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Square? Even one day a year? If not, don't blame us anal Aussies.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>Well, having lived in New York and Cambridge, I would say that up
<BR>
until a few years ago anyway, New York was more like Sydney.
<BR>
Cambridge has more vestiges of the puritans I think (like bar closing
<BR>
at 1AM!).  However, about a year ago, on my daily commute from the
<BR>
Harvard Square train station to my house I had to seriously revise my
<BR>
view of the community.  I chanced to walk through Harvard Yard the
<BR>
night of the first snowfall.  As I got about to the middle of the
<BR>
yard, (near the pump, for people who know Harvard) I heard a loud
<BR>
banging of drums and a lot of cheering, followed by the glare of
<BR>
hundreds of camera flashes.  Immediately thereafter I observed several
<BR>
hundred students emerging from some campus building to take off in a
<BR>
footrace around the perimeter of the yard, all wearing nothing but
<BR>
running shoes and smiles.
<BR>
<P>I got to the far gate of the yard just in advance of the runners and
<BR>
proceeded on my route home thinking both &quot;You don't see that everyday&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;Gee, they must be cold&quot;.  Anyway, the kids are all right.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
<BR>
James Wetterau
