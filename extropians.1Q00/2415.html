... or to talk about existence of the player:

<P><A HREF="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/02/09/linuxdvd/index.html">http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/02/09/linuxdvd/index.html</A>
<BR>
<P>In any case, it's an interesting case of criminalization of
<BR>
source code, and speech about it.  So if you tell your friends
<BR>
that they can play their own DVDs on their own Linux machine,
<BR>
you all can shortly find yourselves raped in the democratic
<BR>
U.S. jails (funded at the expense of friends yet uncaught at
<BR>
other similarly horrible crimes).
<BR>
<P>It's still legal to talk about nuclear weapons though; the
<BR>
logic of criminalization of various things in this country
<BR>
keeps puzzling me, though the number of activities being
<BR>
criminalized doesn't anymore. 
<BR>
<P>And the limits of tolerance of the supposedly free American
<BR>
public are definitely not reached yet...
<BR>
<P>Also interesting fact is that you would be punished for mere
<BR>
existence of the tools that could allow you to commit crimes.
<BR>
In Russia, this was called &quot;preventive terror&quot;.
<BR>
<P>If this approach develops further, you may want to remove
<BR>
all tools from your possession that could allow you to commit
<BR>
any prohibited violent or sexual acts.
