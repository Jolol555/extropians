<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This is the kind of prejudice that has caused the problem of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;obesity to be ignored and even blamed on the victim.  Obesity, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;often age related. People who follow the same diet and exercise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;programs for years, suddenly reach a certain age, and start
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;packing on weight like mad.
</EM><BR>
<P>Only a very small minority of those who are obese are there because
<BR>
of a medical condition. For most it is a matter of more calories in
<BR>
than out.
<BR>
<P>And yes, as we age we require alot less in the way of food, so the
<BR>
same old diet and exercise will not do. The body quickly adapts to
<BR>
exercise, and is able to perform the same work expending less
<BR>
energy.
<BR>
<P>The U.S. Constitution aside, we are not all created equal. I'm the
<BR>
only endomorph in a family of ectomorphs. Everyone else in my
<BR>
family can eat like crazy and stay thin as rails, but they have a
<BR>
very difficult time adding muscle. Being a happy endomorph I have
<BR>
to count my calories, but thrice weekly weightlifting sessions have
<BR>
left my ectomorph brothers nearly 6&quot; and 75 lbs behind. I've been
<BR>
tossing both of them around like ragdolls since our early teens. 
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;And apparently, when they are encouraged to follow low fat/low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;calorie diets, their problems get worse.  Anyway,  for a rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lengthy and technical discussion of the subject, read
</EM><BR>

<P>Dieting does not work, you've got to eat to lose weight, but what,
<BR>
when, and especially how much is the trick . I checked out the site
<BR>
you mentioned, yeah alot of it has to do with genetics. We
<BR>
endomorphs create more fat cells and are better at filling them,
<BR>
but until the gene engineers come along and fix that we're on our
<BR>
own.
<BR>
<P>The trick is to stop waiting for a magic pill and get down to the
<BR>
hard work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Exercise is a good thing, it helps improve insulin resistance, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unfortunately it is not a solution.
</EM><BR>
<P>Weight loss is 80% diet (as in eating right) and 20% exercise. The
<BR>
best exercise to lose weight is the &quot;push away&quot; as in pushing away
<BR>
from the table.
<BR>
<P>Check out Roy Walfords books on eating for nutrient density
<BR>
regardless of calorie restriction.
