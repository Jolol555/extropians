I've enjoyed Damien's insight and comments for some time.
<BR>
For those wanting THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION now,
<BR>
you can order it like I did via
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.co.uk">http://www.amazon.co.uk</A>
<BR>
While amazon in the US did not list this book, amazon UK
<BR>
had it.  Surprisingly amazon UK also had all my info from
<BR>
the US already set up, making ordering easy.  Unfortunately everything
<BR>
is in pounds, so I only had a rough idea what I was paying.  Commerce
<BR>
websites could use an option to display final amounts in a variety of
<BR>
currencies.  It was delivered in less than a week, and the total cost
<BR>
was under $30.00 US.
<BR>
<P>I looked for the SPIKE about a year ago, and the only listings were in
<BR>
Australia.  Unfortunately, the sites were not set up for foreign orders,
<BR>
so I was not able to get it.  I'm amazed at how the web is opening up
<BR>
the world marketplace, and also amazed at how some companies do little
<BR>
to help those from outside their local geopolitical boundary.
<BR>
<P>Incidently Damien, reading Australian newspapers gives an interesting slant to
<BR>
the news for those accustomed to just the US.  There are stories the common
<BR>
media in the US totally ignore.  Though,
<BR>
I find it almost impossible to follow the internal politics and sports,
<BR>
both are apparently violent, confrontational, and involve lots of
<BR>
beer. :-)
<BR>
<P>I'm anxiously waiting to order the revised SPIKE. Hopefully electronic books
<BR>
like www.fatbrain.com  will speed up publishing in the future.  10 months
<BR>
to get a revised edition of a book to the stores is kinda slow in the
<BR>
wired world.

<EM>&gt; &gt;Is The Spike available in

<EM>&gt; Revised/updated version just dispatched to NY NY a week or so back, disk

<EM>&gt; should be with editor even as we speak.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But I guess Tor won't have it out until the end of the year or start of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2001 - an auspicious date, however. I sincerely hope it rips through the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; top of the best-seller list graph paper. (Until then, though, no, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; available; Amazon has the sequel, THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION, listed for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; April availability, so I'm guessing it's the dregs of the Oz print run

<EM>&gt; being shipped to the States.
