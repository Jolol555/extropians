<EM>&gt; Which is the only broadly accepted, complete analysis of the FBI

<EM>&gt; The anti-gunners have not been able to disprove any of his conclusions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with their own study. The best they can do is cherry pick 5 (count em:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5) counties in the US where their claims held up for short periods, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those abberrations John Lott has shown were entirely due to single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crimes (spree killings).
</EM><BR>
<P>Usually these arguments don't get as far as the cherry basket.  Lott did
<BR>
his analysis while at U.Chicago on a visiting scholarship funded by the
<BR>
Olin Foundation, which has ancestral links to the Olin Corporation,
<BR>
which makes ammo (among other things?); so the fascists crow that Lott
<BR>
is &quot;a paid whore for the death industry,&quot; and smugly retire from the
<BR>
field.
<BR>
<P>Never mind that the Olin Foundation (let alone the Olin Corporation)
<BR>
exercises no control over the scholarship.  The appointment is in the
<BR>
hands of people in the Chicago economics faculty.  The previous
<BR>
incumbent, David Friedman (who was on this list once upon a time), says
<BR>
he met someone from Olin exactly once, at a banquet or some such; she
<BR>
asked what he was working on, and blanched a bit when he told her the
<BR>
benefits of legalizing heroin (or some such thing), but said nothing.
