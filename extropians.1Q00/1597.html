<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; n's actual state of mind, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  example probably captures Robert's experience. For me, such an experience
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be frustrating enough to warrant a response like Robert's, perhaps even a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  stronger one. (I might also just join the drunkenness -- indeed, this might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be another way of understanding Robert's response, his favored drink being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  perhaps different from those of most.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If Extropians lost Robert, the overall caliber of the list would suffer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  immensely. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Losing people is not the point finally.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not sure I agree. No matter --&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Simply put: while ideas are fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; game, character bashing is not welcome anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the net, regardless of the florid prose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one uses. Mr Owen is undoubtably a fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fellow.
</EM><BR>
<P>You seem to think the difference between an attack on an idea and an attack on
<BR>
character is 1) easy to make in this case (or, if difficult, not worth publicly
<BR>
justifying) and 2) relevant.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure about neither of those two things, but then, I take myself to be my
<BR>
ideas, primarily; you may view yourself differently.
<BR>
<P>In any event, I see no significantly greater degree of personal attack in
<BR>
Robert's comments than in Shaun's.
<BR>
<P>That Shaun is the one who started the &quot;incivility&quot; (a term with which you might
<BR>
not agree, I know), yet Robert was the object of your, and others', moral
<BR>
attack, I find interesting. It may of course be that you see nothing whatever
<BR>
wrong with Shaun's tone. But perhaps it's a residue of Christianity: one must
<BR>
&quot;turn the other cheek.&quot; Most likely, it's simply a manifestation of personal
<BR>
allegiance, as most moral sentiments tend to be. I suggest that restricting
<BR>
yourself to the positive side of that allegiance might be more productive (if
<BR>
difficult, to the degree that A = not-B: &quot;A!&quot; can't help but also mean,
<BR>
implicitly, &quot;not-B!&quot; -- though I think Max pulled it off well).
<BR>
<P>Further, you are so certain of these aspects of your moral universe, that you're
<BR>
willing to make an astonishingly absolute statement about right and wrong
<BR>
behavior (&quot;anywhere on the net&quot;) -- one that, qua empirical claim, is clearly
<BR>
wrong, by the way.
<BR>
<P>Finally, one or two of your own statements about Robert look somewhat like
<BR>
character-bashing to me (though I'm still not sure precisely what you mean by
<BR>
&quot;character-bashing&quot;).
<BR>
<P>Ok, enough.
<BR>
<P>(Pardon rushedness.)
<BR>
Best,
<BR>
Brian.
