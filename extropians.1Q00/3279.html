<EM>&gt;&gt;I know the general consensus is that GM food is OK.  But the same &gt; &gt;thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;thought about such things as cigarette smoking, silicone breasts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;thalydomide (sp?) once upon a time.  Sure maybe GM stuff is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;harmless, but my goal is long life.  I ain't taking any chances ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thalidomide: As Jeff points out in another post, it has been shown to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beneficial drug in some instances.  Too bad it was completely banned for so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Smoking: I don't advocate smoking, but it is worth noting that smokers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;almost never get Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease.  Also, as has been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussed on this list, nicotine has been shown to be a potent nootropic.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can even remember consuming a Red Bull-type energy drink in Myanmar a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;couple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;years ago, which had nicotine as an ingredient.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Silicon breast implants, which is what I think you were referring to with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your comment about &quot;silicone breasts&quot;:  What makes you think silicon breast
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;implants are harmful, on a par with smoking?  Just because some trial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lawyers and non-scientist juries have said so?  In fact, I have yet to see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;compelling scientific evidence that this is the case, and I'm not aware 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;such was presented in any of those lawsuits against Dow.  If anyone on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;list has such, I would love to see it.  As far as I can tell, the massive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;litigation over these implants has been one of the greatest legal plunders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of our time.
</EM><BR>
<P>I never meant to imply that I was privy to any evidence (scientific or 
<BR>
otherwise) that smoking, thalydomide or silicone implants were hazardous to 
<BR>
one's health.  I have never conducted any scientific research on this or any 
<BR>
other question.  All I meant to convey is that there have been products in 
<BR>
the past that society has largely accepted as safe and have been widely 
<BR>
consumed, utilized, etc. and later on at least some of the consumers of 
<BR>
those products were *very* sorry that they did so.  My point is that I don't 
<BR>
want to be one of those sorry consumers, regarding GM foods or any other 
<BR>
product whose safety I question.
<BR>
<P>For those of you who feel that silicone breast implants, smoking and 
<BR>
thalydomide will enhance your health, please have at it with my compliments.
<BR>
