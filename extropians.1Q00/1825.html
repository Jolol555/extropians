<P><EM>&gt; Solar tech is not affordable because it is made unaffordable. Do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really believes that an Intel Pentium III 500 Mhz is cheaper to mass-produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a square meter of solar cells?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>*Yes*, a Pentium III is cheaper to mass-produce than a m^2 of solar cells
<BR>
simply on the basis that the materials and thickness are relatively the same,
<BR>
so the cost should scale with area.  While you don't *strictly* have to
<BR>
have the fine lines, quality level of silicon, etc. for solar cells that
<BR>
you need for computer chips, it does provide the greatest efficiency.
<BR>
Now, where chips start getting expensive is when you have to have dozens
<BR>
of processing steps over the same material (that ties up your factory)
<BR>
which ultimately translates into manufacturing equipment costs.
<BR>
<P>Currently the solar industry is getting a big boost from using the
<BR>
leftover (bad) Silicon from the semiconductor industry.  The growth
<BR>
in the semiconductor industry is probably helping to drive down costs
<BR>
in the solar industry.
<BR>
<P>Ultimately though this comes down to market size.  Once the market
<BR>
is large enough and the manufacturing methods productive enough and
<BR>
the materials costs low enough (due to large volumes or cheaper
<BR>
materials), then solar will become very available.  Nanotech makes
<BR>
solar inevitable because it makes the factories and materials, literally
<BR>
&quot;dirt&quot; cheap.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  So sorry, what is MEMS? Maybe I missed something on this thread?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>MEMS is MicroElectrical Mechanical Systems if I recall (someone please
<BR>
correct if I'm misreading my hard drive).
<BR>
<P>Its the process of building mostly mechanical parts with a little
<BR>
electrical or electrostatics thrown in using variants of the standard
<BR>
semiconductor manufacturing methods.  Its used to make the accelerometers
<BR>
that trigger your car air bags as well as a host of other emerging things.
<BR>
<P>Where it gets interesting is when the folks at MIT get micro-gas turbines
<BR>
and they get manufactured in mega-quantities that let you use arrays
<BR>
of them to power your Moller Air Car...  No nano required.  I don't
<BR>
know if I trust even 8 engines, but give me a few million and I think
<BR>
I'd feel pretty safe.
<BR>
<P>Commenting on some other comments.
<BR>
<P>As Hal observed the paper seems iffy.  My reading of it is that
<BR>
they think they can setup a oscillating membrane, but don't seem
<BR>
to discuss if its possible to harvest power from that.  Of course
<BR>
if you tie the center of a flexible membrane to a shaft that hooks
<BR>
a ratchet gear it would seem thats going to give you rotational
<BR>
mechanical energy.  This may be one of those things that works
<BR>
from a theoretical point (i.e. if the surfaces were &quot;infinate&quot; or
<BR>
you didn't have any frictional losses), but when it comes to
<BR>
actually designing it mechanically, it just doesn't fly.
<BR>
<P>In thinking about Michael's comment regarding tapping this energy,
<BR>
it seems the question is whether the harvesting of the quantum field
<BR>
energy and eventually dumping it into heat in this universe leads
<BR>
to it eventually flowing back down into the quantum field...
<BR>
Or another way of looking at this is - Is there a &quot;coupling&quot; between
<BR>
radiation in the universe and the quantum field?
<BR>
<P>Way beyond my level of physics...
<BR>
