<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Orwell never spent any time in a communist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; nation, he only knew what he heard by hanging out with the Cambridge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; bred aristo-communists popular in Britain in the 30's.  Ask Sasha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Chislenko what he thinks...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Orwell also spent some time in Spain during the Spanish Civil War
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (1936-1939).  He even joined a militia there.  He did get to see how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Communists, especially Stalinists, operate up close and personal.  In
</EM><BR>
fact,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; he wrote a book on it, _Homage to Catalonia_ in 1938.  This is a far cry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; from just hanging out in Cambridge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, I heard about that the other day on the anarchist newsgroup.
</EM><BR>
<P>How come it took Michael so long?:)  I've known about this because I've read
<BR>
some of Orwell's works -- and, well, because he's kind of a name in
<BR>
literature.  Not knowing about Orwell's time in Spain is almost akin to not
<BR>
knowing Stephen King lives in Maine.:)  If I were told to list, say, 100
<BR>
20th century writers I knew, he [Orwell and, yeah, King too:)] would
<BR>
probably be on it.  Also, if I were told to attack someone's character, I
<BR>
would do a little research about the person...  It's not like Orwell hid his
<BR>
life story.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; His
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; animosity towards Stalin was because Josef supposedly didn't keep his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promises to the spanish communists. However, Spain was hardly a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communist country at that point, it was merely a rather ravaged country.
</EM><BR>
<P>I never claimed it was a communist country, but the point is Michael's above
<BR>
quoted comments make it seem like Orwell lived a sheltered life.  (Ditto for
<BR>
other artists.  What of A. Solzhenitsyn (just about any book by him) or Ayn
<BR>
Rand (_Anthem_ and _We the Living_; the former should be compared with
<BR>
_Nineteen Eighty-Four_, especially in the area of Newspeak) -- two writers
<BR>
who wrote about communist countries who had an inside view of things?)
