<EM>&gt;Greg, I agree with you on the silicone implant business. But I think you're 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conceding too much here. I don't really know what people thought about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;smoking earlier, but I would *not* make a blanket statement that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Thalidomide is &quot;bad&quot;. It's actually a tremendously effective and safe 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;drug--for everyone *except* pregnant women. Banning it entirely was an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;overreaction that deprived many people of its benefits. The sensible 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;response would have been to require regular pregnancy tests (or only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;prescribe it for men) rather than banning it. I believe there have recently 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been some moves towards reintroducing it carefully.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, despite the potential uses of Thalidomide, it is the cases
<BR>
like this which help cement the public's fear of the sciences.  Not only do
<BR>
bans on drugs and other health\science products deprive any potential user
<BR>
of the good aspects of the products, but it also creates a widespread
<BR>
aversion to any similar products.  Due to the ban on Thalidomide (the
<BR>
ban...not the drug itself) any similar seeming cure-all will be viewed with
<BR>
great suspicion, and will be forced to spend far more time than necessary
<BR>
in research and development before the FDA will allow it to go to market;
<BR>
this could, depending on the nature of the drug, kill people due to
<BR>
governmental negligence.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In all sciences, it is apparently easier for the public to recall a
<BR>
negative precedent rather than a positive one.  With genetic engineering,
<BR>
Hitler's war-time experiments is the predominant thought association; with
<BR>
space travel, people think of the recent failures of the Mars probes rather
<BR>
than the euphoria of the moon walk thirty years ago.  With AI, the thought
<BR>
is of Hal...sentience gone awry, rather than the potential benefits.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though perhaps I am straying off topic, I believe that the main reason for
<BR>
the negative reaction of the public to new health and science research is
<BR>
the bias of the media.  Most people who read newspapers and watch or listen
<BR>
to news broadcasts only learn of the catastrophic stories as opposed to the
<BR>
ones which espouse potential benefits to mankind.  In the eyes of most
<BR>
media publications and broadcasts, the &quot;bad&quot; is far more newsworthy than
<BR>
the &quot;good.&quot;
<BR>
Even when scientific breakthroughs such as cloning make the headlines, the
<BR>
public only hear the facts through the grimy mirror of the reporter's bias.
<BR>
&nbsp;As a result, the general public accepts the bias itself as fact --as a
<BR>
clear reflection-- rather than the whole story itself.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Though I often hear Extropians and other futurists claim &quot;...we'll drag
<BR>
[the public] along with us whether they like it or not,&quot; I think the only
<BR>
way to really have mankind itself progress (not just those of us who will
<BR>
do our best to create these futures ourselves) is to keep people informed
<BR>
honestly.  I would like to see local and national newspapers and broadcasts
<BR>
with a positive bias, rather than a negative one.  It would take time, but
<BR>
I would rather have a society that is somewhat neutral or supportive of
<BR>
scientific progress than the one we have now which is constantly suspicious
<BR>
and against it.
