<P><EM>&gt; The Constitutional answer, that there has to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a law passed by a deliberative body *and* a willing jury, is probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as close as you can get without an observer-independent method of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distinguishing between good laws and bad laws.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree pretty much with what Eliezer says.  However, lets return to a
<BR>
subject I believe Sasha intiated.  That of the abundance of &quot;Blue Laws&quot;
<BR>
and other &quot;will-of-the-fantasy-believing-majority&quot; controlling the
<BR>
behavior of minorities.
<BR>
<P>Now, this came up perhaps 6-8 years ago when the FDA was trying to
<BR>
regulate the amino acid supplements market and supplement &quot;claims&quot;
<BR>
(before the Hatch bill was passed I believe).  Durk Pearson and
<BR>
Sandy Shaw (authors of &quot;Life Extension&quot;) got actively involved in
<BR>
the legal action in this case (being children of the Berkeley &quot;60's&quot;
<BR>
radical era).  In some of the literature, I read about this, it was argued 
<BR>
that there was a legal basis for a jury providing a 3rd trial outcome
<BR>
(other than finding the defendent guilty or non-guilty).  They could in fact
<BR>
find the law &quot;invalid&quot;.  Durk and Sandy argued that this would be the
<BR>
best way to get law under which the FDA was attempting to control
<BR>
supplement distribution and product &quot;claims&quot; thrown out.
<BR>
<P>Does anyone know whether or not this is the case and whether this
<BR>
defense has ever been tried for the people to &quot;take back the government&quot;?
<BR>
<P>Now, that question being asked, then one gets back to my original
<BR>
question regarding &quot;peers&quot;.  I would consider &quot;peers&quot; to be either
<BR>
agnostics or athiests.  When defense selects juries, can they
<BR>
only select people that fall into those categories since they
<BR>
are presumably the only people capable of coming to rational
<BR>
conclusions based on the evidence presented.
