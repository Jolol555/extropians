<P>
Iridium is not the only bad news.
<BR>
<P>The 17 ton Cpmpton Gamma Ray Observatory is one of the most fruitful
<BR>
scientific satellites in history, revolutionizing our understanding of Black Holes
<BR>
and Gamma Ray Bursters among many other things. The device is a jewel, it's
<BR>
still working fine, it's still producing priceless data.  Thus NASA has decided to
<BR>
destroy it on June 3.
<BR>
<P>It seems that one of its 3 gyroscopes has failed, this has no effect on observations
<BR>
but if another one dies they wouldn't be able to make a controlled re-entry. According
<BR>
to NASA's figures, in a uncontrolled re-entry there is one chance in a thousand the
<BR>
debris will hit somebody. There is enough fuel to boost it into a higher orbit so it won't
<BR>
re-enter for at least a century but this was felt to be unfair to our poor descendents,
<BR>
they just wouldn't be able to defend themselves from such a thing. So this typical
<BR>
government agency came up with a better idea, they will use the fuel to push one of
<BR>
the most marvelous instrument ever made in the opposite direction and crash it into
<BR>
the Pacific Ocean.
<BR>
<P>This solution gives insight into NASA's values and its idea of what the future
<BR>
will be like. We must take measures to make sure there is not one chance in
<BR>
a thousand of killing somebody in a 100 years, especially for a reason as trivial as
<BR>
scientific knowledge. Even in the year 2100 a re-entering 17 ton non-radioactive
<BR>
satellite in a very predictable orbit will still be an awesome danger to our powerless
<BR>
descendents.
<BR>
