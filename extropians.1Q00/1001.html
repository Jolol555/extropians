<EM>&gt;  &gt; &quot;So high, so low, so many things to know.&quot;  -- V. Vinge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What's you angle on OnOff btw? Is it a galactic halo or deep core
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; artefact?
</EM><BR>
<P>Given that the core is in the unthinking depths, and the elliptical orbit
<BR>
of the On/Off star would have it out in the halo most of the time, it's
<BR>
probably from the Beyond.  Perhaps if the time of the collapse of the ultra
<BR>
tech on the Spider world could be accurately dated, Pham would have a clue
<BR>
that it was the *core* where things failed- and thus the wrong place to
<BR>
look.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And is the magic machine really broken? When do you think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Powers have gotten their first good look on Pham Nuwen for AFUTD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reconstruction, during the OnOff episode, or during his later
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; campaigns?
</EM><BR>
<P>Not broken, but real sick- and I hadn't thought of the possibility of
<BR>
agents of the Powers recording Pham before he went deep- maybe the Pham
<BR>
rebuilt in the Transcend had never really been to the depths...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The Diamonds are the most obvious possible Transcend/core artefacts.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, yeah- and the diamond diatoms are broken nanoarbiters.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Btw, the law-tweaking cavorite from diamondoid nanocomputer (the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Emergents nor the Queng Ho really did take a look at the molecular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structure? And what was it powered with?) was imo the weakest part in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the thing. It is consistent with the high/low polarity in that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; particular universe, however.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really necessary to the story line, either, but evocative of The
<BR>
Blabber.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm hazy on AFUTD details, did the Power claim the body of Pham was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discovered after his expedition gracing the Mindless Depths, or was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this just a cover story?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, that's what it *claimed*, but Ravna had her doubts all along.  The
<BR>
idea the Pham was recorded at the Spider world before he went Deep has
<BR>
merit.
<BR>
<P>Damn, I like those books.  Sensawunda in spades... gotta reread AFUtD.
