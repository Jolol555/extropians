<EM>&gt; Yeah, but it's so messy. And who wants to get their leg sawn off?

<P>Between sawing off legs and playing with intersex sheep, I don't
<BR>
see how you aussies have time to go to the beer &quot;tastings&quot;...
<BR>
<P>At any rate, sawing off legs will probably not do the trick.
<BR>
Bone mass tends to be highly correlated with stress put on
<BR>
it, so it better reflects how much weight lifting you do.
<BR>
<P>Collagen cross linking has been used as an effective measure
<BR>
of &quot;biological&quot; age.  Steve Austad for example used it in his
<BR>
studies of &quot;aging rates&quot; in opposums.  However &quot;chronological&quot;
<BR>
age requires something in the body that grows continuously
<BR>
(perhaps only nose and ear cartilage).  But these don't
<BR>
grow on an &quot;annual&quot; basis.  They are controlled more by
<BR>
nutritional and genetic effects.  So in my mind that leaves
<BR>
perhaps only radioactive isotopes in non-recycled tissues.
<BR>
That probably means only teeth.  So you would need a *hyper*
<BR>
sensitive mass-spectrometer to deal with long lived isotopes
<BR>
like K40 (which I believe is present in the hydroxyapatite in
<BR>
teeth) or a lot of material to deal with short lived isotopes
<BR>
like C14 (if it is even remains in any quantities in teeth).
<BR>
<P>So, the answer to the best of my knowledge is that there is
<BR>
currently no reliable way of dating the age of a human.
