</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What do you think?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm afraid I really don't buy into this mapping.  Perhaps you're using a
<BR>
different definition of &quot;Atheist&quot; than I am.  I consider myself an atheist
<BR>
(meaning that I do not believe in any of the posited &quot;God&quot;s), yet:
<BR>
<P>1) I am friends with agnostics, christians, jews, wiccans, pagans, and other
<BR>
religious sorts.
<BR>
2) I am open to changing my opinion given evidence which contradicts it.
<BR>
3) I make no claim that those who believe other than I do will suffer for it
<BR>
for all eternity.
<BR>
4) I am not engaged in any aggressive evangelism of atheist views.
<BR>
<P>I believe there are a great many other atheists who share these traits.
<BR>
These traits seem radically different from the traits associated with
<BR>
fundamentalism:
<BR>
<P>1) Rigid adherence to beliefs and rejection of contrary evidence.
<BR>
2) Hatred of those with opposing beliefs.
<BR>
3) Evangelism.
<BR>
4) Frequent belief that those with different beliefs will be punished.
<BR>
<P>To me, agnostic means &quot;I would like to believe in a higher power, but am
<BR>
undecided.&quot; and atheist means &quot;I do not believe in a higher power.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I think what you are trying to map here under &quot;atheist&quot; is a position like
<BR>
&quot;I am adamantly opposed to any belief in a higher power, and will not
<BR>
consider any evidence for such a belief.&quot;  This is beyond atheism.
