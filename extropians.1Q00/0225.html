<P>
<EM>&gt; In one case you've got billions of people believing in an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absolute fabrication, in the other you've got billions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people trying to follow the possible insights of someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who may have been either a very wise man or a superior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolved life form.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Very very different things.  I guess in my mind, the question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is do you group Jesus with Plato or the individuals who committed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Watergate break-ins?
</EM><BR>
<P>My own guess at this is that Jesus (ignore for the moment that he 
<BR>
probably wasn't actually called that) was a fairly modest 
<BR>
religious philosopher and teacher with a small &quot;cult&quot; following, 
<BR>
who's legend grew all out of proportion to the reality. A very 
<BR>
large and complex myth with a nugget of truth in the middle.
<BR>
<P>Thomas Jefferson felt that many of the New Testament accounts of 
<BR>
Jesus words and deeds were so at odds with each other that they 
<BR>
could not be describing the same person. I think he was quite 
<BR>
likely right, and that this inconsistency was due to the stories 
<BR>
having been distorted to express the particular author's views 
<BR>
rather than those of Jesus himself.
<BR>
<P>This is, of course, mere speculation.
