<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Maryland Medical Center 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;UM researchers discover 'key' to blood-brain barrier 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Findings Could Lead to New Treatments for Brain Disorders 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in
<BR>
Baltimore have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;identified a receptor in the human brain that regulates the interface
<BR>
between the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bloodstream and the brain, which is known as the blood-brain barrier. This
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;breakthrough could lead to a better understanding of this nearly
<BR>
impenetrable barrier
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and to treatment of diseases that affect the brain, such as Multiple
<BR>
Sclerosis, brain
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tumors, meningitis, Alzheimer's disease, and HIV infection. The
<BR>
findings are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;published in the January issue of the Journal of Neurochemistry.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The blood-brain barrier is a collection of cells that press together to
<BR>
block many
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;substances from entering the brain, while allowing others to pass. For
<BR>
years, scientists
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knew little about how this barrier was regulated or why certain
<BR>
diseases are able to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;manipulate the barrier and infect the brain. Earlier research conducted
<BR>
at the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Maryland School of Medicine found that two proteins,
<BR>
known as zonulin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and zot, unlock the cell barrier in the intestine. The proteins attach
<BR>
themselves to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;receptors in the intestine to open the junctions between the cells and
<BR>
allow substances
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to be absorbed. The new research indicates that zonulin and zot also
<BR>
react with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;similar receptors in the brain.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The blood-brain barrier is like a gateway to the brain. It is almost
<BR>
always locked,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keeping out many diseases. Unfortunately, it also keeps out medications
<BR>
as well.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost nothing can pass,&quot; explains lead author Alessio Fasano, M.D.,
<BR>
professor of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pediatrics and physiology at the University of Maryland School of
<BR>
Medicine, and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;director of Pediatric Gastroenterology at the University of Maryland
<BR>
Hospital for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Children. &quot;First we discovered the key, and now we've found the lock
<BR>
that fits that key
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to open the gateway into the brain. This discovery could help us open
<BR>
that gateway,&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;explains Dr. Fasano.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Fasano and his team studied brain tissue samples obtained from a
<BR>
brain and tissue
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bank at the University of Maryland. The brain tissue was treated with
<BR>
purified zonulin
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and zot proteins, then examined under a microscope. Researchers
<BR>
observed the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;zonulin and zot proteins binding with the brain tissue. Next, they
<BR>
compared the results
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to tests on tissue samples from the intestines. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We've known about the blood-brain barrier for more than 100 years, but
<BR>
we've never
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;been able to figure out how it worked. Now we have a new piece to the
<BR>
puzzle,&quot; says
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Fasano. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The identification of these proteins in the human brain holds the
<BR>
promise of allowing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;us to deliver new types of medications across the blood-brain barrier.
<BR>
It would be a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;boon to humanity if the blood-brain barrier could be opened briefly,
<BR>
and safely, to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow passage of a new generation of drugs into the brain,&quot; says Ronald
<BR>
Zielke, Ph.D.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;co- author, professor of pediatrics and director of the brain and
<BR>
tissue bank at the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;University of Maryland School of Medicine. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Fasano adds that more research is needed to understand how zonulin
<BR>
and zot work
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during the formation and development of the brain. The current study
<BR>
was funded by a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;grant from the National Institutes of Health. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
