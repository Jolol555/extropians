<P>
My real issues with this thread is not whether or not people can get behind 
<BR>
this particular theory of Multiple Intelligences. 
<BR>
<P>The truly alarming part is that they don't want to redefine intelligence at 
<BR>
ALL, but adhere to the original definition a la 1905. This is the problem I 
<BR>
have with most conservative models, they prefer to look back on the tried and 
<BR>
true, preferably pre 1950, rather than make a stab at any future uncertainty.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It's normal for our species to create, as time goes by,  more comprehensive 
<BR>
definitions of Intelligence. This thread could be seen as a discussion that 
<BR>
encompass the many attributes that make up a human mind, but as usual, people 
<BR>
are looking at this as a political battle. It's almost comical.
<BR>
<P>If I disagreed with the theory I would see this thread as a challenge to 
<BR>
create a model
<BR>
that did encompass the whole picture, not just the limited ones within 1905 
<BR>
psychologists reach. It's like Harry Brown saying how wonderful the fifties 
<BR>
were, before everything went to hell!! I had to laugh out loud! 
<BR>
<P>Perhaps it WILL become apparent what intelligence is ONLY when we the 
<BR>
cognitive sciences discover all the brain/body processes. In the meantime, a 
<BR>
forward looking view is always better than looking back. Even if a current 
<BR>
theory is proven wrong, it's likely that in 1905 the psychologists did not 
<BR>
have as much evidence as researchers do now.
<BR>
The last post by Matthew brought up to me the thought that as we go forward 
<BR>
into technology a LOT of terms and values will have to be redefined, indeed 
<BR>
&quot;amplified upon&quot; not just the words &quot;selfish&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>No matter how we cling to the original definition, its not the whole picture 
<BR>
of a human mind.
<BR>
Perhaps we think a machine that could only think in logic and reason, and has 
<BR>
no other aspects of intelligence, would appear as intelligent in the same way 
<BR>
we do?
