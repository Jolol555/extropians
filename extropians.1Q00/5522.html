|By the way -- for a transhuman angle to all this -- I consider my
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P>I believe more in augmented reality (AR) than virtual reality (VR).
<BR>
VR technology might well become a major entertainment player for the
<BR>
``couch potato'', but then it'll just become a toy.  To use the power
<BR>
for something relevant, IMO AR would be the ticket. When some major corp.
<BR>
starts selling cheap AR sets (wearables), then the chip really hits the fan.
<BR>
<P>+                  I expect this sort of virtual reality (entertainment
<BR>
|for the masses is the supercilious way of looking at it, and notice
<BR>
|I didn't even mention pornography -- until now) to be:
<BR>
<P>|1) capable of sucking up the most advanced information technology
<BR>
|available in the commercial sector for the foreseeable future and
<BR>
<P>Virtual characters working as fronts for one computer system or another,
<BR>
like the virtual Japanese pop star and the virtual TV news anchor.  And
<BR>
random very-realistic games personae of games (watch out for Tekken 6).
<BR>
<P>|2) the most painless and &quot;fun&quot; way for artificial information
<BR>
|processing technology (whether intelligent or not) to infiltrate
<BR>
|and colonize human civilization (and perhaps even the human nervous
<BR>
|system, as Kurzweil suggests in _The Age of Spiritual Machines_).
<BR>
<P>I feel the stench of a Sceptic Tank.  VR would require one to immerse into a
<BR>
virtual world, and block out the real one.  Nah..  AR? Maybe. VR? No way!
<BR>
<P>|Medical applications, while more noble, are neither painless nor
<BR>
|fun (doctors give most people the willies), and the sort of
<BR>
|accounting applications that have been the bread-and-butter of
<BR>
|information technology ever since the Babylonians started
<BR>
|inscribing numbers on clay tablets are dull as dishwater
<BR>
|(that's what I do for my employer).
<BR>
<P>Heh heh..  Just wait 'til govt agents look like a cyborg unit of the major
<BR>
borganism of U.S.Govt.  The Augmented Men of Tomorrow, soon to strike terror
<BR>
in _your_ neighbourhood!
