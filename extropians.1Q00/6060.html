<P><EM>&gt; As you point out, Robert, huge sums of money are already being diverted to

<EM>&gt; health and longevity issues. In fact the desire for longevity is so obvious

<EM>&gt; and the profits so sure, that it doesn't seem to me that anything other

<EM>&gt; than the market is needed to make it happen.

<P>I don't think a substantial desire for longevity -- and following from
<BR>
that, substantial future profits -- is in the least bit obvious.  It may
<BR>
seem that way from spending enough time on this list, but in casual
<BR>
conversation, I find people are generally opposed (often vehemently) to
<BR>
the idea of indefinite lifespan.  However, I think the general
<BR>
population's opinions on death are highly swayable -- often deathist memes
<BR>
are incongruent with the host's own values and beliefs, particularly
<BR>
athiests.  Often, people's opposition to death is just a bunch of
<BR>
unconscious irrationalism: overpopulation concerns, &quot;I will live on
<BR>
through my children/ideas&quot;, &quot;Near Death Experiences prove the existence of
<BR>
an after-life.&quot;  They just haven't thought about it, and there is no
<BR>
widely available information to set them straight.
<BR>
<P>Which brings me back to what Natasha and Robert are saying.  People are
<BR>
acting against their self-interest.  They need to be educated,
<BR>
culturally.  Plain, old-fashioned marketing.  If there is any role for an
<BR>
NGO, it is education.  Once people are sold on the idea that a greatly
<BR>
expanded lifespan is highly valuable for both themselves and most of 
<BR>
the people around them, the market demand and investment dollars will flow
<BR>
naturally.  There is a mantra embedded in the collective consciousness,
<BR>
&quot;The Internet is the Future.&quot;  Seeing how that simple hypnotic phrase has
<BR>
transformed our economy overnight, I can only imagine what the effects
<BR>
would be after embedding a similar suggestion about longevity.
<BR>
<P>What the transhumanist movement really needs is a Strategic Marketing
<BR>
Thinktank.  The issues involved in promoting biological immortalism are
<BR>
not very different from selling a vacuum: identify a value in your
<BR>
customer that is fulfilled by your product, demonstrate this connection to
<BR>
your customer, assess the reaction of your customer to this connection, if
<BR>
the customer has reject your connection as invalid, reframe it or come up
<BR>
with a new connection.  Simple!  Okay, not so simple, but a highly
<BR>
creative and interesting art, and one that a lot of tranhumanists could
<BR>
gain a lot from learning, myself included.
<BR>
<P>There is precedent for philosophical marketing.  Christianity was so
<BR>
brilliantly packaged, it spread through the Hellenic and Roman Empires
<BR>
like wildfire.  I believe the same is possible for extropian
<BR>
memesets.  Facilitated by the Internet, I think we can expect even better
<BR>
results.
