Robert Owen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:rowen@technologist.com?Subject=Re:%20computers%20have%20no%20souls!&In-Reply-To=&lt;3.0.6.32.20000128221941.007b3e40@coastside.net&gt;">rowen@technologist.com</A>&gt; writes, in the thread about 
<BR>
&quot;Damien, spawn of Satan&quot; or &quot;The woman who couldn't handle the truth&quot;:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Questions: [1] what, specifically, is endangered by this thought?; [2]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what is it in the conscious organization that is viewed as irreconcilable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with this idea, such that if the unconscious correlate were to gain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conscious  ascendancy, any coexistence would be impossible and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;current conscious ego-constiuent would be driven into oblivion?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a parenthetical issue, if we assume that the threat entails, among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other things, a potential identity-crisis, what is the woman so identified
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with that its loss is anticipated as catastrophic?
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;unconscious correlate&quot;, &quot;identity crisis&quot;: Bingo!
<BR>
<P>Robert has homed in on the crux of the matter with dazzling precision.  If
<BR>
one combines this with the inbred machinery of human social behavior
<BR>
elaborated by Greg Burch in his &quot;Monkey God&quot; post--beautiful piece of work,
<BR>
Greg-- we have an almost complete picture.
<BR>
<P>I would add only this:  the human infant arrives preconfigured to receive
<BR>
its meme set, which establishes its identity, to itself and to others.
<BR>
This identity appears to have so potent a survival value--evolved in an era
<BR>
before cognition--that people will go ballistic, resort to bloody violence,
<BR>
to protect ideas which, when examined dispassionately are found to be
<BR>
irrational(dogma), or arbitrary(speech patterns, dress styles), not to
<BR>
mention inconsequential.  
<BR>
<P>When abstract thought emerged in the mammalian cortex, those memes found a
<BR>
very sweet little spot to call home, a fortress with built in 24/7
<BR>
gladiator at the battlements.  The rational &quot;I&quot;, meanwhile, remains a fly
<BR>
on the wall or, like Polonious, clueless, puffed up with self-importance,
<BR>
and out of his depth.  Keeper of the library for the beast, his master.
<BR>
But even there, though he keeps them, he is not yet master of &quot;his own&quot; ideas.
<BR>
<P>We modern day intelligent life forms have an abundance of &quot;culture&quot;--all of
<BR>
history, art, and literature--to anchor our tempestuous little drama in a
<BR>
comfortingly familiar context.  I keep thinking of how the Greeks must have
<BR>
felt, being the first (perhaps) to awaken to self-awareness.  How
<BR>
gloriously astonished they must have been, to know themselves for the first
<BR>
time. And then to discover that they were toys of the gods (their
<BR>
passions), in a passion-driven universe.  Talk about your &quot;shit happens!&quot; 
<BR>
<P>Forget about Prometheus, Faust, and Dr. Frankenstein.  That was myth (or
<BR>
literature).  We stand poised to REALLY AND TRULY screw around with the
<BR>
fundamentals.  God! am I jazzed!
<BR>
<P>Read Julian Jaynes' &quot;The Origin of Consciousness in the Breakdown of the
<BR>
Bicameral Mind&quot;.  Jaynes may not have gotten it quite right, but the
<BR>
question of the sequence of events leading from preconsciousness to
<BR>
consciousness is majorly fascinating, and fits right into the puzzle of the
<BR>
emergent synaptotronic noumenon decoder.  Enjoy.
<BR>
<P><P>--------------------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Damien, 
<BR>
<P>Short of reaching out with a defibrillator set on high, clamping the
<BR>
paddles to her temples, and electrically erasing her meme set, I don't see
<BR>
any way of persuading &quot;the woman who couldn't handle the truth&quot; to see it
<BR>
your way.  But, being a semi-professional wiseass, I can think of several
<BR>
fun ways to try.
<BR>
<P>First off, charge admission.  If they pay for it, they'll believe, or
<BR>
they'll believe they were ripped off.  Either way it's easier on you.  
<BR>
You can give freebies to the true believers, who, filling the hall, can
<BR>
then, mob-like, hound and menace any dissenters.  They may not believe, but
<BR>
at least they won't mouth off.  The silence of repression will seem like
<BR>
unanimous support.  Peer pressure can do wonders with the cognitively
<BR>
flaccid. 
<BR>
<P>Give her a bumper sticker that says: &quot;Call me Wormfood!&quot; (Or, the Herman
<BR>
Melville version, &quot;Call me fishmeal!&quot;)
<BR>
<P>I could go on, but, hey, I'm not gettin' paid either.
<BR>
<P>As always, with love,
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
