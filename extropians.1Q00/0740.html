Robert, like I, tends to be a fairly independent sort with a rather
<BR>
unusual CV.  His primary degree is in law with psychology and physics
<BR>
thrown in as minors or alternate degrees.  More of his work has been
<BR>
in more &quot;popular&quot; magazines than peer reviewed journals. Getting
<BR>
Xenology, plus the full text of the NASA self-replication study
<BR>
available (by spring) in combination with Nanomedicine I think
<BR>
provides a boost to his credibility.  We had applied for a
<BR>
grant under the NASA Advanced Technologies program to expand
<BR>
the study of &quot;Dyson Shells&quot; but it didn't get accepted.  It
<BR>
turns out that NASA may be back-peddling re: nanotech, as according
<BR>
to Ralph (via R.F.), Al Globus is no longer working on computational
<BR>
nanotech (if he is even still at NASA).  That leaves the CalTech
<BR>
group being the driving force on nanotech molecular modeling.
<BR>
<P>[If someone knows more about this, I'm sure the group would like to
<BR>
know.  In general, NASA needs a really serious wakeup call vis-a-vis
<BR>
long term planning and the consequeces of nanotech.  There will
<BR>
be a point in time when it makes no sense to continue planning
<BR>
non-nanotech missions.  When that will be isn't exactly clear.
<BR>
As something really off the subject, its interesting to consider
<BR>
that the recent Mars losses might be avoided in the future
<BR>
if NASA considers installing a set of micro-GPS satellites around
<BR>
Mars to be able to land the spacecraft more accurately.]
<BR>
<P>The McArthur Foundation and a few others are certainly worth
<BR>
considering and we may get to that point.  What would be really
<BR>
nice is if individuals would periodically contribute to the
<BR>
Foresight Nanomedicine fund (why not everyone consider donating
<BR>
something on your birthday as a present to themselves???) and
<BR>
those of us who know &quot;angels&quot; would work on getting them into
<BR>
the Matching Funds program, so the rest of our funds get amplified
<BR>
more.
<BR>
<P>IMO, one of the most leveraged things any of us can do is to
<BR>
support the writing of Nanomedicine and share it with our
<BR>
friends, physicians, etc.  For those of you that don't know
<BR>
Robert is planning to write a &quot;popular&quot; condensation of the
<BR>
Nanomedicine volumes, but only after they are all done.  He
<BR>
chose to take this approach since the order that Eric used
<BR>
with Engines of Creation followed by Nanosystems created
<BR>
a lot of negative impressions among the scientists, whom
<BR>
as Eric put it, &quot;... can't believe anything without an
<BR>
equation documenting it...&quot;.   Robert's current production
<BR>
rate is about a chapter a month.  For those of you who
<BR>
who have a copy of NM, you know that works out to hundreds of
<BR>
references per chapter that Robert has to organize and
<BR>
condense each month! 
<BR>
<P>The first printing of NM was 1000 copies.  It would be really
<BR>
nice to push it into its second printing within its first year.
<BR>
For comparison purposes, Nanosystems has sold 10000+ copies in
<BR>
the last 8 years.
