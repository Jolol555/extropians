Abortions and cryonics.... I doubt that joint idea will ever get off the 
<BR>
ground.  Most patients who have abortions have already gone through enough 
<BR>
psychological trauma prior to electing to have an abortion.  Its not an easy 
<BR>
decision.  I doubt that someone who wants to have an abortion would want to 
<BR>
add the tremendous,  added psychic trauma of having the aborted  embryo 
<BR>
'frozen'.  
<BR>
<P>However, I am sure the 'pro-life' people would be excited about it so not 
<BR>
only can they say they saved 'another life', but that they could have the 
<BR>
abortee reminded   everyday that, 'yes, there's the life you disallowed to 
<BR>
enjoy life.'  The fact that the embryo could be viable 10, 20, or 100 years 
<BR>
down the line via nanotech will in no way mitigate the tremendous 
<BR>
psychological trauma already a part of anyone considering and electing to 
<BR>
have an abortion.    And how do you think the recipients of incest-rape would 
<BR>
feel to have an embryo frozen?  Imagine a 15 year old teenager who is raped 
<BR>
(and teenage rape is not rare in this country.)  Just what she needs, to be 
<BR>
reminded of it the rest of her life.  
<BR>
<P>I know it is easy to 'armchair' this topic, but I doubt you will get very 
<BR>
many women who have had an abortion who would even consider such cryonic 
<BR>
suspension.
