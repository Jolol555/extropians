<EM>&gt; The one thought that kept running through my mind while reading
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _Nanosystems_ is that assuming that a single dislocated atom knocks out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a mechanism is not a &quot;conservative&quot; assumption.  It is vastly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; optimistic.  Even assuming that a single dislocated atom causes a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complete system crash is optimistic.  Speaking as a programmer, if every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; error produced an immediate and simple crash, life would be a lot easier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than it is.  Assuming that a single dislocated atom causes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; production of subtly wrong moieties that break or subtly corrupt the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rest of the system; now that's realistic.  Nanodebugging the declarative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design errors will be nightmare enough; debugging radiation damage will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be beyond imagining.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think this is quite right, because what he tried to show was that
<BR>
even if a part was considered broken if a single atom was out of place,
<BR>
these malfunctioning units would still be an inconsequential fraction of
<BR>
the whole.  This is conservative because many single-atom displacements
<BR>
would have only minor effects or no effects at all.
<BR>
<P>Drexler did not assume that all failures are passive, rather he showed
<BR>
that the number of failures could be made so small that the amount of
<BR>
trouble they can cause should be very limited.  Once you have a model
<BR>
for your error rate, you can look at your application and judge whether
<BR>
even rather dangerous failure modes in the failing units are tolerable
<BR>
if there are few enough of them.
<BR>
<P>A self-replicating system is an especially difficult case, because the
<BR>
total mass of such systems may grow to an enormous degree over the
<BR>
centuries, and so even an extremely small percentage of misbehaving
<BR>
replicators may cause considerable trouble to those people who are
<BR>
unlucky enough to be involved with their offspring, assuming that they
<BR>
could reproduce for a long time without their problems being detected.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There's no way - that I know of, anyway, correct me if I'm wrong - to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read out the atomic positions inside a complex molecular structure.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have enough trouble designing computer systems that will operate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spite of programmer errors.  Imagine the problem of designing a computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system that has to operate in spite of random bitflips, when there's no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way to examine outputs directly, just take a few simple measurements.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the time of assembly it is much easier to check for errors.
<BR>
Repeated insertion and verification steps can reduce the error to a
<BR>
very low level.  It is true that after assembly is complete, internal
<BR>
spontaneous or radiation generated errors may be difficult to detect.
<BR>
Nevertheless functional tests of the entire unit can be used to
<BR>
characterize and detect many failure modes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It seems to me that one of the major problems of nanotechnology will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; designing systems that fail reliably (or systems in which any error not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;measurable&quot; to a checking mechanism must automatically maintain all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design characteristics; after all, any error which shows up externally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; must be &quot;measurable&quot; in some sense).
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, or another approach would be to design systems which can be taken
<BR>
apart relatively easily for inspection (destructive inspection).  Then you
<BR>
can sample a certain percentage of your product (whether replicators or
<BR>
not) and determine whether they match the design specs.
