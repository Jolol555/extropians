<EM>&gt; Charles _has_ been harsh, but you should judge this from a long

<EM>&gt; history of provokation, and keep in mind his intent.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I myself have been somewhat rude to Bill Brown, and hereby
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apologize. I just got mad.
</EM><BR>
<P>S'okay.  I'm used to it.  But really, I think you guys have mistaken me for
<BR>
something I'm not.
<BR>
<P>I'm not one of these people who thinks that the Omega point has already made
<BR>
everyone immortal, and all we have to do is sit back and enjoy.  I don't
<BR>
think that the nanoclaus machines will arrive in 5 years, and instantly
<BR>
produce magical computers that can compute the entire past state of the
<BR>
universe by examining a hot cup of tea.  And I certainly don't think we
<BR>
should stop doing research.
<BR>
<P>I do, however, think that the few people who actually do research on
<BR>
suspension techniques spend all their time concentrating on how brains get
<BR>
damaged in the present, which leaves them with very little time to think
<BR>
about how they could be repaired in the future.  This is entirely
<BR>
appropriate, since the present is what we need to concentrate on now.
<BR>
However, it seems to result in an undue level of pessimism over the ultimate
<BR>
prospects for repair.  To be honest, Charles Platt's reply reminds me a lot
<BR>
of the things the cryobiologists like to say about cryonicists - totally
<BR>
true from his perspective, but essentially irrelevant from mine.
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless, I'm willing to take another shot at this if you are.  My basic
<BR>
points are simply:
<BR>
<P>1) The fact that a structure looks completely scrambled tells you almost
<BR>
nothing about how hard it would be to figure out what it originally looked
<BR>
like.  Look at image processing, or cryptography, or archaeology for that
<BR>
matter.  That doesn't mean that success is guaranteed in every case, but
<BR>
experience shows that it is always possible to deduce a lot more than a
<BR>
non-specialist would expect.  Unfortunately, computational brain
<BR>
reconstruction is a specialty that doesn't exist yet, so we can't just ask
<BR>
an expert about it.
<BR>
<P>2) Every repair scheme I've ever heard of relies on massive computing power
<BR>
and very limited intelligence.  This is totally unrealistic.  We should
<BR>
expect both the computing power and the intelligence of possible repair
<BR>
technologies to increase steadily over time, and it is not at all clear what
<BR>
the ultimate limits might be.  IOW, we should ask whether a team of
<BR>
scientists with unlimited time and funding could reconstruct the state of
<BR>
cell X, not whether we can see how to write a program to do the job.
<BR>
<P>3) Many people seem to think that there is no point in signing up for
<BR>
suspension, because they will never actually get frozen.  This is simply
<BR>
nonsense.  Most cryonicists do in fact end up being suspended when they die.
<BR>
So, people shouldn't use this as an excuse for dismissing cryonics - if you
<BR>
don't think it will work, argue that it won't work.  (Mind you, the system
<BR>
could be a lot better than it is if the money was there, but that is a
<BR>
different issue).
