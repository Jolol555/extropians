<P>
Friends,
<BR>
<P>I wrote 
<BR>
<EM> &gt;The older the universe, the more capable and community-minded the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &quot;residents&quot; are likely to be.
</EM><BR>
<P>and Anders replied:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Why? Capable may be likely, but community mindedness does not have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be greater. 
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Here's why I see more community-mindedness.
<BR>
<P>Aggressive behavior in a community of two or three or even half-a-dozen
<BR>
equally capable entities, might be sustainable.  One entity might surprise
<BR>
and overwhelm another, and enlarge its power. It then might continue, using
<BR>
its increased power succesfully against the remaining limited opposition.
<BR>
But in a community numbering over--you pick a number: 30?, 50?,
<BR>
100?,--there comes a point where the threat to all becomes known to all,
<BR>
and the combined strength of the community becomes their source of security.
<BR>
<P>Regarding human societies, there have never been more than a handful of
<BR>
nearly matched competitive regimes.  And these have often formed themselves
<BR>
into bipolar alliances.   Such bipolarity arguably maximizes the prospect
<BR>
of aggressive adventurism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;After all, see the complex behavior of cooperation in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;iterated prisoners' dilemma when run as a genetic algorithm - long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;periods of calm and cooperations, followed by breakdowns and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;restorations. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not thoroughly familiar with the prisoner's dilemma.  But as I recall
<BR>
there are two prisoner's held by a dominant power.  What happens when you
<BR>
change the underlying assumptions to fifty non-prisoners each dominated by
<BR>
the combined power of all the others?  Besides which, doesn't &quot;long periods
<BR>
of calm and cooperation&quot; describe &quot;community-mindedness&quot;, at least in
<BR>
behavior if not in inclination?   
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Just look around on this list, and ask yourself: would anybody here
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(given enough resources) start a replicator scenario without being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cautious? I think the answer is yes, there are a few of us who might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take the chance regardless of risks or due to a philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;position.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fair enough.  But once again, the community of communities on this planet
<BR>
would have resources and motivation to intervene in any action which could
<BR>
pose a significant risk to all.  Which brings us to the difficulty posed by
<BR>
having to pull it off covertly, by a small group, and with limited
<BR>
resources.  Admittedly, a nanoprobe scenario might not require much in the
<BR>
way of material resources, but there is a substantial difference between a
<BR>
lone-gunman nanoprobe scenario, and an imperial juggernaut nanoprobe
<BR>
scenario.  The lone-gunman scenario is likely to provoke a serious effort
<BR>
to clean up the mess, distribute &quot;nanoprobe-protection&quot; materials, and
<BR>
publish energetic apologies.  Which is to say, manifest community-mindedness.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;the probability of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;launching is nonzero.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  But we're still left with the question, &quot;How large?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;---------------------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Also, as 
<BR>
<P>&quot;Andrew R. Sujdak&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:arsujdak@midway.uchicago.edu?Subject=Re:%20*Bzzzt*%20Fermi%20Paradox&In-Reply-To=&lt;3.0.6.32.20000116220109.007b9510@coastside.net&gt;">arsujdak@midway.uchicago.edu</A>&gt; observes, 
<BR>
<P>the character of the probes is central to what--for good or ill-- they can
<BR>
accomplish.  And the discussion to this point suffers greatly from an
<BR>
paucity of these crucial details.
<BR>
<P>Practice safe interstellar intercourse.  Launch only approved probes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
