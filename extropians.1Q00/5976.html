<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;You have a strange and rather arbitrary definition of &quot;efficient&quot; (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;equitable&quot; for that matter).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;That you will &quot;never be convinced&quot; suggests a position that is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;rational in its basis.  In fact, dumping *is* more efficient and to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;benefit of *everyone* in the long-term than doing as you suggest.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;hardly call forcing a farmer to sell their grain at or below cost to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&quot;equitable&quot;; it sounds like theft to me.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would say that *you* have a strange and rather arbitrary definition of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;theft.&quot;  I'm no farmer, but I'm sure that as between selling my grain 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cost and just dumping it for nothing, I'd much rather do the former.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would *rather* sell it at a profit, but I would *not* consider someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; offering to pay cost for something that I otherwise plan to just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;destroy, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be a thief.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If farmers wanted to sell their product at or below cost, they would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already be doing it.  Since the only way this will happen is through force,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it can be called theft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;At cost&quot; is a strawman.  The market would handle the situation just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fine if it was merely &quot;at cost&quot;.  Margins are generally quite thin so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it isn't a case of price gouging.  Most of the countries receiving grain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get it free or substantially below cost.  If they could afford to pay at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cost it would be largely a non-issue, since it would allow the producers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to stay competitive with people re-selling their product.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Let me explain it again:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If producers give away excess capacity below cost, it lowers the average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;margin on the grain that they do sell for a profit, sometimes forcing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them out of the market.  The short-term effect may be beneficial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(recovering expenses), but the glut of too cheap grain creates a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;negative long-term effect on overall production because it decreases the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effective market size from a producers standpoint.  If the world worked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your way, the producers would quickly sink into unprofitability and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would shut down.
</EM><BR>
<P>So its just like OPEC.  They are destroying produce to artificially inflate 
<BR>
the price.  Perhaps this indicates that there are too many grain producers 
<BR>
and that society (and the grain market) would be better off if some of them 
<BR>
*did* shut down?  I realize that probably wouldn't go over too well for 
<BR>
those producers that had to do the shutting down.  But in general might it 
<BR>
not be better than the collosal waste that current practice creates?
<BR>
