<EM>&gt; &gt; Are you referring to the creep who shot at some Jewish children, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; killed a postman?  If so, this is the first I've heard that he didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; act alone.  I do seem to recall it was said that he intended his acts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be the signal for a pogrom -- but if that makes him &quot;a militia&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you might as well say the Black Panthers killed Sharon Tate.

<EM>&gt; Fact is that Bufford is a member of Phineas Priests which have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solid Militia ties.
</EM><BR>
<P>As solid as McVeigh's?
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the question wasn't &quot;has any crazed loner on some militia-fringe
<BR>
group's mailing list ever killed anybody&quot; but &quot;has any citizen militia
<BR>
ever killed anybody?&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The question is of dubious relevance anyway; the militia movement is not
<BR>
and never was monolithic.  It may well include racists; it also includes
<BR>
Blacks (like the spokesman for a prominent Ohio group) and Jews (like
<BR>
most of the San Diego group, or so it was said some years ago).
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; If the &quot;militias' don't seem to discriminate regarding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; klan allegience, why need I?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;To avoid the appearance of know-nothing bigotry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Klan and militias mix in well because they are the same identical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people who hold the same identical philosophies.  Why should I fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Johnny laws goons more then some self-appointed hayseed death-squad? 
</EM><BR>
<P>Because those self-appointed hayseed death-squads haven't attacked
<BR>
anybody yet; while pro-government extremists with badges harass, rob and
<BR>
kill innocent people year in and year out, and get away with it.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; As far as being a know-nothing bigot? So be it!  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By the by, MacVeigh trained with the Michigan Militia
</EM><BR>
<P>McVeigh was trained (and decorated iirc) by the US Army, and the
<BR>
Michigan Militia told him to get lost.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; which was filled with Klaners-fancy that? ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Anyone who questions the legitimacy of the current imperial regime in
<BR>
Washington sooner or later gets labelled &quot;White supremacist&quot;.  Some
<BR>
evidence on this point would be nice.
<BR>
<P>On another hand, the bombing was on the anniversary of the Waco fire,
<BR>
and is generally assumed to be retaliation for it (I don't know whether
<BR>
McVeigh has said anything to support that assumption).  Do you know what
<BR>
fraction of the Branch Davidians were White?
