<EM>&gt; Perhaps. But what about &quot;use-related damage&quot; or mechanical senescence that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might not be derived from aging itself. For example: presbyopia, molar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; erosion, hardening of joints, and menopause.
</EM><BR>
<P>These things are included of course.  Whether or not you classify them
<BR>
with &quot;aging&quot; is a semantic issue.  I would probably include vision
<BR>
changes (increasing the hazard function) and tooth loss as quite
<BR>
significant.  Elephants are supposed to go through many molars but
<BR>
the replacment function is limited (whether by genetics or failure
<BR>
of the replacement tissue is unclear), so for them this is clearly
<BR>
an age-related cause of death.  In humans it isn't so much tooth loss
<BR>
but failure of taste &amp; smell (leading to decreased interest in food)
<BR>
and failure of the gut (leading to decreased nutrient absorption).
<BR>
I'd put these as downstream from my previous reasons (telomere shortening
<BR>
being the most likely upstream source of the failures).
<BR>
<P>I'm less concerned with things that are not &quot;universally&quot; fatal
<BR>
(e.g. menopause) or can currently be treated (e.g. replacement joints
<BR>
or teeth).  If there is a reasonable strategy for fixing the consequences
<BR>
of the problem (e.g. hormone replacement in women), then I would
<BR>
want emphasis shifted to the next problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Species that appear not to age
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have different physiologies that allow them to cope with these situations.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, but the nice thing about nature is that we have examples of genetic
<BR>
programs that solve some of these problems.  Humans can &quot;borrow&quot; the
<BR>
tooth replacement strategy of elephants or even better sharks.  The
<BR>
anti-cancer program of elephants or whales also would be useful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even that we do not age, these problems might still affect us. Of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this depends on how you define aging but I think that senescence and certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; age-related changes might be independent of one another (as predicted from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolutionary theory).
</EM><BR>
<P>Precisely.  To solve aging you have to knock off the problems one by one.
<BR>
As you solve each, you will reveal something that was previously
<BR>
unnoticed.  Fortunately we have enough insights at this point that
<BR>
we can work on the problems simultaneously.
