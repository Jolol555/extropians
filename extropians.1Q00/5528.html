<EM>&gt;  The obvious hypothesis is that people who are unwilling to listen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kaczynski's arguments will more reliably reject his dangerous ideas.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I.e. people who are quick to point out that they disagree with him are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; either admitting they can't be trusted to distinguish between the reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arguments that Kaczynski makes and the unreasonable ones, or (more likely?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they don't have enough of a reputation for reasonableness that others
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can know whether they can be so trusted.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd be more inclined to phrase it this way:  Kaczynski is a bad guy. 
<BR>
You are only allowed to say bad things about bad guys.  Everyone who
<BR>
says bad things about a bad guy gets social bonus points.  If you say
<BR>
sufficiently bad things about a bad guy, you get extra status points for
<BR>
leading the mob.  Everything a bad guy says is bad.  Bad guys are not
<BR>
allowed to have any redeeming qualities (unless they're fictional bad
<BR>
guys, of course, in which case they are required); if you point out a
<BR>
redeeming quality, you're probably a bad guy yourself and a good target
<BR>
for the aforesaid social mob.
<BR>
<P>Logic and reality have nothing to do with it.  There are only behaviors;
<BR>
the behavior of saying something bad about a bad guy, and the behavior
<BR>
of saying something good about a bad guy.  The words spoken are not
<BR>
representational, semantic statements; they are behaviors.  One behavior
<BR>
is expected of group members, and the other is not.  Insofar as these
<BR>
behaviors denote anything, they denote group allegiances.  The odd and
<BR>
paradoxical 'behavior' of saying something bad about your own group, or
<BR>
something good about an enemy group, is a modern innovation confined to
<BR>
small groups of peculiar individuals; it is too infrequent to be
<BR>
considered as a possible interpretation in social interactions.
