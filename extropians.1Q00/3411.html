<P>Considering that there is still such disagreement about how much information
<BR>
would be needed to reconstruct a person (as well as about how much useful
<BR>
information there is in frozen tissue), I think it might make sense to
<BR>
conserve traces of one's mind's activities, for example by not deleting
<BR>
one's hard drive. Not as a substitute for cryonics, but as a dirt-cheap way
<BR>
of preserving additional information that could improve a cryonics
<BR>
reconstruction, or in the absence of cryonics give you at least some small
<BR>
chance of being reconstructed by a superintelligence, who may know enough
<BR>
about human psychology, genetics and the society you lived in to use the
<BR>
traces to reconstruct you. Having a videotape of yourself might also be a
<BR>
good idea.
<BR>
<P>In the future, it may be feasible to record everything that goes into your
<BR>
sensory organs and everything you do via your muscle movements. A
<BR>
superitelligence studying such a detailed record of your life history might
<BR>
well be able to reconstruct a great deal about how your mind was
<BR>
constituted. 
<BR>
<P>I have tried to think of some consideration or some test that could
<BR>
determine whether this would be possible to do in principle, but haven't
<BR>
come up with anything yet; it seems a wide open question. Any ideas on how
<BR>
one could settle the issue, short of building a superintelligence and
<BR>
trying?
