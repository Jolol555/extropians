<P>
Hal offered a very helpful summary of recent advances in ecash, concluding:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Whomever wins, once there is a widespread person to person payment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  infrastructure it should be possible to layer ecash on top of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  This might lead to a more decentralized solution which would be less of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a target for regulators.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  You'll notice that a lot of this has happened only in the last few weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and even days.  It's very exciting to watch.
</EM><BR>
<P>My $.02, from a legal/regulatory point of view: Internet gambling offers one 
<BR>
of the most likely vectors for the widespread use of ecash.  The compressed 
<BR>
analysis: Most Internet commerce to date has relied on credit cards, 
<BR>
notwithstanding their salient downsides, because consumers already have them 
<BR>
ready-at-hand.  Legal and policy developments will, however, increasingly 
<BR>
make credit cards unsuitable for Internet gambling.  See, e.g., lawsuits 
<BR>
brought against credit card companies that allegedly enabled illegal gambling 
<BR>
and proposed legislation outlawing many types of Internet gambling.  
<BR>
Consumers won't want to give up Internet gambling and Internet gambling 
<BR>
services will have strong incentives to push payment methods less susceptible 
<BR>
to regulatory interference than are credit cards.
<BR>
<P>Once Internet casinos help to establish ecash among their customers, network 
<BR>
returns will kick in and . . . voila!  We get a robust ecash economy.
<BR>
<P>T.0. Morrow
