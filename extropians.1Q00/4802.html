<EM>&gt; Lately I've been thinking that the period between the Franco-Prussian

<EM>&gt; War and WWI might have some lessons for the current time, in many ways.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That was also a long period of relative peace in the relations of the &quot;Great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Powers&quot;, and was also increasingly seen by contemporaries as a kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Golden(or &quot;Gilded&quot;) Age (see Twain's writings).  However, it seems that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military and geopolitical predominance of the US is greater now than that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enjoyed by the UK in that period.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I do think we are in a sort of golden age.  'Pax Americana' is now in force
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and god forbid any nation get in the way of our economic and political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interest.  Isn't neo-colonialism great when you're the one on top? ;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I hope the analogy does not hold up in the sense that by the mid 21st
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; century we will see an age of horrifying conflict.  'Down and out' former
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; great powers like China, Russia and India are hungry to play catch-up with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the United States and Europe.  How long will that take(if ever) and when it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happens what will they want from us??
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm thinking that either Euroland, Russia, or India, will move into the
<BR>
place of Teddy Roosevelt Era America and become a strong ally against
<BR>
the burgeoning Borg of Greater China.

<EM>&gt; One of the main characteristics of these kinds of vehicles is their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; significantly lower cost than current- and next-generation manned fighter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aircraft, since they 1) don't have to carry pilot-support systems and 2) can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be built with much lower service-life expectations in terms of numbers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hours of total system operation.  They also have significantly enlarged
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flight and tactical envelopes, since they don't have to be constrained by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the limit of g-forces a human can survive and can be risked in threat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environments much more dangerous than those to which a modern democracy will
</EM><BR>

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I remember how Arthur C. Clarke predicted such warcraft in his book _2019_
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which came out in the mid-eighties I believe.  Of course, I am sure long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before that these aircraft had been conceived of.  My question is, could the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software and hardware of a drone really equal the flying skills of a gifted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and experienced human pilot?  I suppose it could come close, and by not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being constrained by the limits of having a human on board, be much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deadlier.
</EM><BR>
<P>A local company I know, Creare, that works exclusively in developing new
<BR>
technolgies on contract, has been working for several years on a fluid
<BR>
rebreathing system for the US Air Force, presumably to enable pilots to
<BR>
be able to withstand much higher g forces. The only difficulty to date
<BR>
is training pilots to overcome the reflex against drowning on a regular
<BR>
basis...this is the sort of technology you saw in 'The Abyss' used by
<BR>
divers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whatever happened to so-called 'anti-gravity technology?'  I remember seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; old newsreels showing researchers flying several feet of the ground on what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought were devices that projected strong magnetic fields.  Where is this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research now?
</EM><BR>
<P>The 'old newsreels' were probably of the Avrojet vehicle. Current
<BR>
technology is dealing with superconductors, zero point field
<BR>
manipulation, and near-relativistic energy centrifuge inertial drives.
<BR>
Stay tuned, or to quote Eliezer....
<BR>
<P>near term technologies are the Moller Air Car and another personal one
<BR>
man VTOL aircraft.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If this were perfected I could see the navy becoming airbourne with aircraft
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; carriers taking after the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier which Nick Fury sometimes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lead his striketeam's from.  Now that would impress the neighbors!  And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could you imagine the bomb tonnage you could drop on someone with such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; craft?
</EM><BR>
<P>Vertical takeoff technologies of any kind tend to be less efficient at
<BR>
carrying heavy payloads than normal fixed wing aircraft. The largest
<BR>
helicopter in the world can lift some 26 tons, while the largest
<BR>
aircraft can carry some ten times that amount.

<EM>&gt; The point of this digression is that the military think-tank establishment

<EM>&gt; &quot;nano-war&quot;: The factors described above in connection with anticipation of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strategic and tactical environment characterized by a tiered deployment of

<EM>&gt; The present military mindset of the pentagon does seem to be very forward
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking.  I know they love to write reports about 'war in 2020' a great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deal!  The military has had a fascination with pilot-less weapon platforms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for awhile and now the tech is getting here to makes such things a reality.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Go Bolo!  For the glory of the Corps!! :)  I also see a natural process
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going on that will ultimately lead to nano-warfare.  And I am sure the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pentagon already has reports written on the big picture! lol
</EM><BR>
<P>They do do big picture stuff, and see individualist technophiles like us
<BR>
as a potential threat to the security of the power of the state.
<BR>
<P>They have put a big priority on developing nanotech and defenses against
<BR>
it.
