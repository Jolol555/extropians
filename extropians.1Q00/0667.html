<P>Indeed. As long as the government outlaws strong crypto[1] so
<BR>
that phones can be tapped more easily, they shouldn't be surprised
<BR>
that phones _are_ easily tappable. Outlawing the listening devices
<BR>
for the phone calls will make sure that only criminals (both within
<BR>
and outside the government) can tap phone calls...
<BR>
<P>Cracking down on Joe Random Hacker is _not_ going to influence
<BR>
phone tapping at all, but only serves as a pretense to the
<BR>
general public that the government is interested in privacy.

<P>It's comparable to what the movie industry is trying to do to
<BR>
the consumer with DVD region coding and crypto. For the unaware,
<BR>
`region coding' is marking a disk with a region code &quot;This disk
<BR>
may only be played in North America&quot; and enforcing that limitation
<BR>
in hardware or software -- players that obey the region code are
<BR>
illegal in New Zealand and rare in Europe because they infringe on
<BR>
consumers' rights...
<BR>
<P>As for the encryption, officially it is meant to stop piracy, but
<BR>
large-scale DVD piracy (where most of the pirated copies come from)
<BR>
is using DVD mastering equipment which simply bitcopies the disk.
<BR>
<P>What encryption _does_ stop is `fair use' copies, which consumers
<BR>
are entitled to make (both by law and by the `fair use' clause in
<BR>
the Berne Convention on Copyright), forcing consumers to spend more
<BR>
money than they'd have to or (illegally) limiting them in their
<BR>
opportunities to use the product they bought!
<BR>
<P>Visit <A HREF="http://www.opendvd.org/">http://www.opendvd.org/</A> and help this campaign, if only to
<BR>
make sure that this affair won't set the precedent that businesses
<BR>
can overturn our legal rights[2]!

[1] Yeah, not officially, but for all practical purposes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there's quite a crackdown on all things cryptology.
<BR>
[2] Which is what the movie industry is doing now, the excuse
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being that they cannot face competition with themselves!
