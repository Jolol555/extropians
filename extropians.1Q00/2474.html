<EM>&gt; This is one way things may go, but I'm not sure the &quot;Thompson hack&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be the preferred way to prevent assemblers from building dangerous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; objects.  The unique aspect of Thompson's idea was that the compiler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would recognize when it was compiling itself, and build the hack into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the new compiler, even though it wasn't present in the source code.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Yeah. What I'm thinking of is using the Thompson hack to ensure that any
<BR>
assembler created by _other_ assemblers will have some sort of hook for
<BR>
law enforcement/security monitoring built into it. This raises an
<BR>
obstacle to anyone trying to use an assembler to build tools suitable
<BR>
for creating nasties, because they have to build their first-generation
<BR>
assembler from scratch. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It does seem reasonable that assemblers would be limited in some ways,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but this particular method has disadvantages.  It relies on secrecy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and if everyone knows it's there you might as well do things openly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It also is somewhat brittle in that the code can't change much or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hack won't recognize where it has to insert itself in the new version.
</EM><BR>
<P>True: I'm assuming fairly standardized consumer items here, the
<BR>
products of a mature technology. I'm also assuming that *most* of the
<BR>
enforcement side of things will take place at the software level, in
<BR>
whatever nanocomputers control the assemblers.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I suspect it would be more likely that an assembler (by which I mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a large device which might be in a home and used to build clothes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; furnishings, electronics, etc.) will have a catalog of devices it can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; build, with variations that can be programmed in.  Maybe one assembler
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can build another, but you wouldn't have control at the level of making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changes to remove limitations on what it could build, any more than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; MUD program lets you drop into assembly language.
</EM><BR>
<P>And here we hit a terminology problem: what is an assembler?
<BR>
<P>I think we need to carefully distinguish macroscopic machines (capable
<BR>
of creating other macroscopic machines by use of molecular-scale
<BR>
subassemblies) from the molecular-scale assemblers. The security issues
<BR>
for each are different. Wearing a policeman's hat, my goal for the
<BR>
macroscopic machines (macros?) would be &quot;(a) stop them being used to
<BR>
assemble weapons of mass destruction&quot;. My goal for the nanoscale machines
<BR>
(nanos?)  would be &quot;(b) stop them from being used to assemble macros
<BR>
capable of (a)&quot;, and a secondary goal of &quot;(c) stop them from assembling
<BR>
a range of nasty molecules that we really don't want, like botulinum
<BR>
or Novichuk-B&quot;.
<BR>
<P>This gives us three distinct monitoring and prevention problems. And
<BR>
they do overlap: a MUD isn't _supposed_ to let you drop into assembly
<BR>
language, but if you have the source code to it you can go looking for
<BR>
a workable buffer overrun attack that lets you write arbitrary machine
<BR>
instructions on its heap.
<BR>
<P>Given the general-purpose capabilities of a macroscopic assembler, I'd
<BR>
expect that any attempt to market a black-box unit that only registered
<BR>
designs can be manufactured on will meet with consumer resistance (and
<BR>
hackers). Hell, people even hack Microsoft Barney! The precedents are
<BR>
not good; any security mechanism will need to be based on something
<BR>
much more solid than security through obscurity, or saying &quot;it is a 
<BR>
criminal offense to tamper with an ACME AnyFab machine&quot;. That's why
<BR>
I'm trying to think up a fail-safe approah.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; An interesting example though of where secrecy is used for somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; similar purposes to what you desribe: recently there have been articles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revealing that color copiers each have a unique digital &quot;fingerprint&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which they embed into copies.  Given a copy it is possible to trace it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back to the exact machine which made it.  This is intended as an anti
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counterfeiting measure.  Most people have been unaware of this (although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rumors have been around for years).  See the well respected Privacy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Forum Digest at <A HREF="http://www.vortex.com/privacy/priv.08.18">http://www.vortex.com/privacy/priv.08.18</A>.
</EM><BR>
<P>Seen it.
