<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;  o	Why do apparently reasonable and rational human believe in ``qualia''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;	as some kind of mystical, and un-explainable, semi-supernatural entity?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm sorry, I didn't inted to claim it was anything
<BR>
supernatural, unexplainable, non-scientific or anything.  I even think
<BR>
&quot;qualia&quot; can me modeled or abstractly represented by Turing machines.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only thing I am pointing out is that there are some
<BR>
fundamental phenomenal qualities of the physical stuff our brain uses
<BR>
to consciously represent information.  A binary number can abstractly
<BR>
represent the color of red, but there is nothing in an abstract number
<BR>
that is anything like such a phenomenal quality that we &quot;experience&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our brain uses a &quot;warm&quot; feeling to represent things of higher
<BR>
temperature.  When science studies &quot;warm&quot; things it discoveries that
<BR>
warm things are different because the molecules are vibrating more
<BR>
rapidly with more kinetic energy.  But such difference in behavior has
<BR>
nothing to do with &quot;warm&quot; other than our brain uses something with a
<BR>
warm quality to represent higher levels of kinetic energy.  Today,
<BR>
when scientists look at neurons firing in response to something that
<BR>
is a higher temperature, all they seem to be looking for is the
<BR>
behavior of the neurons.  They should, in addition to this, be looking
<BR>
for what it is like for such brain matter to do whatever it is doing.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because I'm saying we must look for something more than
<BR>
abstract or Turing behavior doesn't mean it must be something
<BR>
supernatural.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There must be real scientific ways to discover such phenomenal
<BR>
qualities and differences if we look in the right place and look for
<BR>
more than just abstract behavior.  A field of green leaves is
<BR>
different than a red cherry.  This phenomenal quality difference
<BR>
between the red spot in the field of green is what enables us to pick
<BR>
the cherry out of the green.  Just knowing how we are able to pick out
<BR>
the red cherry is only half of the science.  We must also look for
<BR>
what the qualitative and phenomenal difference is between the red, the
<BR>
green.... and the warm, the salty, the painful...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Simply pointing out that there are no such things out beyond
<BR>
our senses (other than the behavior they abstractly represent) doesn't
<BR>
imply that it must be something supernatural.  As I said, science will
<BR>
eventually discover these natural and real things so common in our
<BR>
physical brain.  But first, we must look for more than just the
<BR>
abstract Turing behavior.  We must also look for what it is like.
<BR>
Discovering this will be the greatest scientific discovery to date, I
<BR>
think anyway.  Once we do accomplish this, machines will be saying
<BR>
things like: &quot;Oh That's what salt tastes like.  Wow.&quot;  And We'll know,
<BR>
scientifically, that they are not lieing because we will know what and
<BR>
why such natural feelings really are.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     As a matter of fact, I have not seen any current FAQ on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     subjects.  Does one exist?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know of one yet, and I am working on one.  Does anyone
<BR>
want to help out?
<BR>
