<P>Hey, good plan!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;* Within a simulation, a weak-minded military officer receives a message
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from someone outside the simulation, informing him that his superior, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has recently been promoted under mysterious circumstances, is actually a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deadly criminal, who has uploaded into this simulation to avoid the death
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;penalty.  The man receives orders to &quot;kill&quot; his superior, ejecting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;criminal from the program, allowing him to be tried.  He hesitates doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so, and [at least appears to] go insane.  Fending off a number of attacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on his life, he ultimately &quot;kills&quot; his superior, though dying in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;attempt.  Emphasis on epistemology of &quot;knowing&quot; you're in the simulation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;[It'd be good to get the women in here somehow, but in thinking about it a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little while, I'm not sure how one would do it. &lt;shrug&gt;]
</EM><BR>
<P>No, this goes wrong toward the end. What happens (bringing in those absent
<BR>
women) is that the faux-mad officer, made incapable of action by lustful
<BR>
feelings for his high-born mother, is saved by his ferocious grrlfriend who
<BR>
kills the criminal superior for him (nicely fashionable feminist touch, you
<BR>
see), and then together, with the help of his own uploaded AI associate, he
<BR>
and she could transition into yet another virtuality, and have kids with a
<BR>
mysterious natural affinity for tweaking cyberspace, while preparing to
<BR>
return en famille and *really* set things right.
<BR>
<P>You could call it... I dunno... THE WIDE ABBOT'S CURSE.
