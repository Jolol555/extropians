<EM>&gt; &gt; If you've never felt pain you wouldn't know what pleasure is.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Perhaps this is not quite so, ie, there is a difference between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pleasure and ambiguity, but it is along the same lines as yin/yang,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; perhaps even Jungianism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I disagree. Pain is very different from pleasure (one is IMHO a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somatosensory alerting system, the other a motivation regulation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system) and not comensurable even if they tend to inhibit each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other. People with no pain sensitivity are able to be happy. I wonder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if there are any people lacking *mental* distress? Probably even more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handicapping than lacking pain sensors, but I don't see any reason why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they would be unable to feel pleasure (hmm, let's see... a lesion to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the amygdala, perhaps some to the periaqueductal grey, definitely one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the anterior cingulum... any takers? :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well said.  It is so that those without pain receptors might be happy on
<BR>
some scale of emotional well-being.  Yet, perhaps those happy people
<BR>
without pain receptors would not be aware of how good their pain-free state
<BR>
was compared to one with pain.
<BR>
<P>I am glad not to experience very much pain, and would not choose to
<BR>
experience pain, unless it were to have some higher purpose.
<BR>
<P>So, we might say pain is not necessarily the opposite of pleasure, and that
<BR>
pain vs. lack of pain are opposites, with House of Pain being a defunct rap
<BR>
group.  So, I would say that to experience pain, pleasure, and a variety of
<BR>
other emotions, and recognize them as such, and relate them to each other,
<BR>
it is necssary to have experienced them.
<BR>

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Am I getting too neuroscientifically narrowminded again? I have a flu,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so my stupidity-inhibiting subsystems are not performing as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they usually do. :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it is certainly so that brain physiology plays a large role in mental
<BR>
function, although the question of how much of a role ventures into &quot;nature
<BR>
vs. nurture&quot; development theory.
<BR>
<P>Ha ha, &quot;stupidity-inhibiting subsytems&quot;.  Separately, get well soon.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Side note:  political correctness is political correctness.

<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I appear to have drifted, the subject of this e-mail is about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; memetics thus memes.  Visually, the word &quot;memes&quot; looks like it could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be pronounced &quot;mee mees&quot; when it is pronounced &quot;meems.&quot;  The mass
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; media is its own meme.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I always think of the word as shouting &quot;Me! Me!&quot;. They are small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-referential critters, those memes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I only did as I wrote the above, and a few times before that, yet not
<BR>
within six months of first ever reading it, and more times since reading it
<BR>
as written above.

<P>I know not too much about pain, never having third degree burns or bearing
<BR>
children or more fictionally a Gesserit rite.  Not knowing much about it
<BR>
besides having been born, childbirth is a painful experience with often
<BR>
pleasant outcome, babies.
