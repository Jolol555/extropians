<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Orwell never spent any time in a communist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nation, he only knew what he heard by hanging out with the Cambridge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bred aristo-communists popular in Britain in the 30's.  Ask Sasha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chislenko what he thinks...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Orwell also spent some time in Spain during the Spanish Civil War
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; (1936-1939).  He even joined a militia there.  He did get to see how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Communists, especially Stalinists, operate up close and personal.  In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; he wrote a book on it, _Homage to Catalonia_ in 1938.  This is a far cry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; from just hanging out in Cambridge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Yes, I heard about that the other day on the anarchist newsgroup.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How come it took Michael so long?:)  I've known about this because I've read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some of Orwell's works -- and, well, because he's kind of a name in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; literature.  Not knowing about Orwell's time in Spain is almost akin to not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowing Stephen King lives in Maine.:)  If I were told to list, say, 100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 20th century writers I knew, he [Orwell and, yeah, King too:)] would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably be on it.  Also, if I were told to attack someone's character, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would do a little research about the person...  It's not like Orwell hid his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life story.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; His
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; animosity towards Stalin was because Josef supposedly didn't keep his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; promises to the spanish communists. However, Spain was hardly a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; communist country at that point, it was merely a rather ravaged country.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I never claimed it was a communist country, but the point is Michael's above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quoted comments make it seem like Orwell lived a sheltered life.  (Ditto for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other artists.  What of A. Solzhenitsyn (just about any book by him) or Ayn
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Rand (_Anthem_ and _We the Living_; the former should be compared with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; _Nineteen Eighty-Four_, especially in the area of Newspeak) -- two writers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who wrote about communist countries who had an inside view of things?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>WHile Orwell was wounded in the throat (shaving?) in the Zaragoza area
<BR>
after spending serveral boring months there, it turns out the group he
<BR>
had enlisted in (POUM) was considered to be allied with Franco.
<BR>
Additionally, in his own words, he was from the &quot;lower-upper middle
<BR>
class&quot; and was a graduate of Eton, so yes, he did live a sheltered life.
<BR>
Granted when he decided to become a writer, he intentionally spent a
<BR>
good amount of time living among the poor and destitute, washing dishes,
<BR>
etc. However the reason he used the pen name George Orwell, (rather than
<BR>
his given name of Eric Blair) was because he wanted to separate himself
<BR>
from his life of priviledge, as well as the fact that he had been
<BR>
employed as a policeman for the Colonial Office in Burma.
<BR>
<P>As for Solzhenitsyn, he actually spent time in the gulag for his
<BR>
dissident activities. When he finally got kicked out of the USSR, he
<BR>
settled here in Vermont, and has lived off of the western royalties for
<BR>
his books ever since, while also doing some stints as a college
<BR>
professor of literature. Now he's back in Russia, and I am told remains
<BR>
an object of adoration and hate, while continuing to poke his nose into
<BR>
dark places, at least figuratively.
