From: Fred Hapgood &lt;<A HREF="mailto:fhapgood@world.std.com?Subject=Re:%20NSG/%20Meeting%20Announcement&In-Reply-To=&lt;xxx200002261651.LAA23283@world.std.com&gt;">fhapgood@world.std.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P>Meeting notice: The 00.03.01 meeting will be held at 7:30 p.m. at 
<BR>
the Royal East (782 Main St., Cambridge), a block down from the 
<BR>
corner of Main St. and Mass Ave.  If you're new and can't 
<BR>
recognize us, ask the manager.  He'll probably know where we are. 
<BR>
<P>&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;&lt;-&gt;
<BR>
<P>Proposed topic:  The onset of the Singularity
<BR>
<P>The question has been lofted at previous meetings as to whether 
<BR>
we are seeing the first signs of 'the Singularity'.  This term, 
<BR>
introduced by SF author Verner Vinge in his novels _The Peace 
<BR>
War_ and _Marooned in RealTime_, refers to a phase of 
<BR>
technological change so rapid that historians or archeologists 
<BR>
examining the traces of a civilization passing through that phase 
<BR>
can make no sense of it at all.   They would be unable to 
<BR>
reconstruct the order of events or the patterns of cause and 
<BR>
effect. 
<BR>
<P>Vinge's thinking was that at some point technology would become 
<BR>
genuinely autocatylic or self- accelerating.  Machines would 
<BR>
accept instructions on the most general level ('amuse me', 'make 
<BR>
me some money', 'reduce the amount of suffering in the world', 
<BR>
'find some new physics'), and be able to go off and without 
<BR>
further input create strategies that satisified those 
<BR>
instructions, even when doing so required developing altogether 
<BR>
new technologies.  In a society like that it would be 
<BR>
inappropriate even to describe the pace of change as 'rapid', 
<BR>
since that term is usually taken as implying a direction, and no 
<BR>
such direction would exist.  
<BR>
<P>Obviously no one thinks such turbo-charged AI is anywhere in 
<BR>
prospect, but technological self-acceleration is not critical to 
<BR>
the model.   If the rate at which innovations appear and are 
<BR>
adopted is sufficiently high, society will enter a Singularity 
<BR>
phase, whether humans retain a role in the process or not.
<BR>
<P>At the moment current speculation about the onset of this phase 
<BR>
change reflects a subjective sense that the 'sound' of the flow 
<BR>
of developments coming out of such fields as molecular 
<BR>
engineering, biotech, MEMS, and computing has acquired a deeper 
<BR>
note over the past few years.  One senses something large and 
<BR>
violent happening downriver,  around the next few bends.   
<BR>
<P>There is another thread of evidence that bears on and confirms 
<BR>
the supposition.  Life inside a society passing through a 
<BR>
Singularity would almost certainly be experienced as profoundly 
<BR>
chaotic.  Generalizations that hitherto have legitimated and 
<BR>
rationalized development and investment decisions would break 
<BR>
down.  As a consequence people would start investing in companies 
<BR>
with business models that made no sense in traditional terms, or 
<BR>
even with no perceptible business model at all (if you don't 
<BR>
count 'and when we've run out of investors we'll get acquired' as 
<BR>
a model).  
<BR>
<P>Investment fashions would wash over the market, attracting vast 
<BR>
amounts of money, and then sink into the sands, losing equally 
<BR>
vast amounts, in days; equity prices would be driven by rumors of 
<BR>
rumors; CEO turnover would soar; marketing horizons -- the date 
<BR>
past which a market for a product is expected to have vanished -- 
<BR>
would shrink again and again.
<BR>
<P>Ring a bell?
<BR>
<P>There is a body of opinion that all the nonsense in the market 
<BR>
today -- in which investors riot to invest in companies losing 
<BR>
the largest possible amounts -- is a reflection of the moral and 
<BR>
intellectual rot that comes at the end of booms, and that once 
<BR>
the correction imposes itself we will return to the orderly 
<BR>
principles that have guided investors for centuries.
<BR>
<P>That might be, but it might have another meaning entirely.  It 
<BR>
might signal the onset of the Singularity.  It is in any case 
<BR>
worth thinking about what it would mean to live and invest,
<BR>
and for that matter, develop nanotechnology, inside a 
<BR>
radically chaotic culture.
