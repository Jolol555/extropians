<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Hey guys, look at this...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [Corel Linux on cheap Intel boxes...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do we really want the whole world using UNIX?  I'll answer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that question for you - no!
</EM><BR>
<P>Whats the matter Bryan? Bummed that unix users won't be so 'leet anymore?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But here's the trillion dollar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question, what OS will we be running in the near future if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not Windows?  Mac OS?  BeOS?  OS/2 Warp?  Anyone know of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promising non-UNIX open source projects?
</EM><BR>
<P>I suggest you look at the Corel linux offering before you toss it out the
<BR>
window. Its extremely easy to install, setup, and use, and comes with lots of
<BR>
good stuff.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It looks to me like Windows is almost ready to die and we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't have anything to take its place in the hearts and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minds of Joe Average (as far as Joe's concerned has there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been any innovation beyond the original Mac?  Does Mac OS X
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have enough eye candy to fool Joe in to thinking computing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has advanced, or will Joe have to continue to rely on id
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Software for that?).  Every company that could be developing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such an OS (I use OS here in the loose Microsoft sense, I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a fan of bloat) is either on the Linux bandwagon or on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'Internet Appliances' bandwagon; neither are going anywhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (I hope).  I don't think the right OS will emerge from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Internet, not in a timely fashion, but I do believe its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source should be open.
</EM><BR>
<P>here's where I have to take exception, Bryan. Corel has already ported its
<BR>
WordPerfect Office Suite to linux, and is close to unveiling the linux port of
<BR>
Ventura Publisher. I've been using the win version of Ventura for several years
<BR>
now, and its gotten to the point where it exceeds anything quark or adobe are
<BR>
able to product for DTP software. Since the x generation of the Mac is going to
<BR>
also be unix based, you will be seeing a Ventura port to Mac at that point.
<BR>
Corel Draw is also on linux, and corel has a whole host of other software makers
<BR>
porting to their linux brand (called COLOS) The corel linux graphical interface
<BR>
is on par with any other GUI, and linux's network capabilities are surperior to
<BR>
windows in all respects. Corel has really jumped onto linux full steam, as they
<BR>
got sick of getting the shaft from microsoft on development information, which
<BR>
repeatedly has caused initial releases of new versions of their software to be
<BR>
quite buggy.
<BR>
<P>I predict that what you will be seeing five yars down the road are three
<BR>
dominant consolidated PC/OS archituctures: Apple MacX, WinTerm/Webtv, and
<BR>
COLOS/Intel. COLOS will be making inroads into Mac's  publishing marketshare due
<BR>
to wider acceptance of Ventura in the traditional DTP world (as opposed to the
<BR>
corporate DTP world which has used Ventura all along), and it will sell well
<BR>
among disgruntled PC users, while the WinTerm will expand into the iMac market
<BR>
as well as into the webtv/home appliance market.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I recently read an article in which a journalist claimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that because of the Web, it doesn't matter what OS you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using as long as it can run a browser.  I've seen other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; journalists claim similar things.  When people genuinely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe bastardised hypertext is the pinnacle of human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; achievement it's time to innovate, and fast!
</EM><BR>
<P>Very true. In publishing, while Acrobat has helped considerably bridge the cross
<BR>
platform needs between the graphic artist publishers and the book publishers,
<BR>
there is no substitute for EPS files sometimes, especiallywhen you are dealing
<BR>
with higher resolution color separations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sometimes I wonder if the current dot-com madness, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; places the emphasis not on technology but on some vague idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a future business model, is simply due to a lull in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software development due to our underestimating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complexity of voice interfaces and other exotica.  Is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; room for something new or should we wait until there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough hardware to do more exotic forms of human-computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interaction, or perhaps even remove the human altogether?
</EM><BR>
<P>The dot com html mania is merely the expansion of the medium into the lower
<BR>
quality niches consumed by the masses, much as Gutenberg's press made the bible
<BR>
easily accessible to the masses, it degraded the quality of the theological
<BR>
debate in europe with high noise to signal ratios.
