<EM>&gt; &gt;So we must ask now:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- How do we begin serious design-ahead now?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- How do we encourage development (on an open-source basis)?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- How do we guide and organize the design-ahead results?  (Ad-hoc
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  organization, Web site, institute?)
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, my strategy as I think some of you can tell is Nano@home.
<BR>
And the next time I get Neil Jacobstein for a long enough face-to-face
<BR>
conversation, I'm going to push on him very hard to consider having
<BR>
IMM/Foresight support this.  A couple of more papers on my part
<BR>
or Anders part re: nanotech enabled SIs and the impact on the
<BR>
entire SETI frame of reference and we should be able to take a
<BR>
crack at creating some &quot;cognitive dissonance&quot; amongst the rather
<BR>
large, &quot;fairly&quot; technical SETI@home collective.  If we can switch
<BR>
even a reasonable subset of this to Nano@home {since it is probable
<BR>
nanotech enables rapid colonization, high power budgets, ubiquitous
<BR>
surveilance, etc. -- if they wanted to &quot;talk&quot; to us, they easily
<BR>
could, they aren't, so there must be a reason for that and the best
<BR>
way to confirm they aren't here or out &quot;there&quot; (meaning intelligent
<BR>
life is *very* hard) is to have nanotech, so we might as well get there
<BR>
as soon as possible and stop playing around with &quot;listening&quot; for
<BR>
sub-nano-tech civilizations...}
<BR>
<P>Now, if we switch enough people, we have the largest supercomputer in the
<BR>
world working on nanotech designs.  Then we have this huge debate about
<BR>
whether private designs first to build up a capital base or open designs to
<BR>
build up a comfortable level of security is the best approach.  In all
<BR>
probability, different people accept different sides of the argument,
<BR>
so we probably get both (as you see now in the biotech approach to
<BR>
the Human Genome Project).
<BR>
<P>It doesn't make sense to push it too hard right now because we first
<BR>
need a software package, and second need some more &quot;popular&quot; literature.
<BR>
So Damien's book getting published in the U.S. may be an added selling
<BR>
point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, of course, Drexler and Merkle and others at Foresight have been doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this, bit by bit, for years. The odd thing is the way their efforts still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appear to be despised by those in the `regular' or canonical-science/tech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; authorised nano community.  One scientist who read THE SPIKE declared flatly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that Eric was a flake (he'd seen him talking at a Foresight conference),
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the perspective of scientific &quot;convention&quot;, Eric is a flake (I mean that
</EM><BR>
in a very complementary way).  So what?  That doesn't affect his science.
<BR>
He has thought the ideas through much further than anyone.  Everyone else
<BR>
is doing 5-10 years of catch-up.  Most scientists, if they have a clue
<BR>
of Eric's range are probably green with envy.  There is also the fact
<BR>
that Eric generally refuses to play the games (teach or play popular
<BR>
grantmanship), that most scientists agree to play to do what interests them
<BR>
(research).  [Caveats -- I think teaching is a noble profession and
<BR>
grantmanship is a good natural selection process when it is working well.]
<BR>
For many &quot;typical&quot; researchers, Eric holds up the principle of questioning
<BR>
themselves about the compromises they make and that isn't a pretty picture.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and that my book should have extirpated all reference to Foresight and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dealt solely with, you know, scanning microscopes and buckytube tips and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like that. *Real* science.
</EM><BR>
<P>The Spike isn't about &quot;real&quot; science (as the other Nanotechnology book
<BR>
you recently mentioned, or Nanomedicine, or Nanosystems).  Its about
<BR>
communicating and understanding the possible impacts of probable science.
<BR>
And in that respect it is much more important.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even though Drexler and pals were there years in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advance of these recent discoveries; even though their projections and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; design-aheads seem (to me, in my comparative ignorance) fully consistent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with what's coming out of the labs. Maybe it's priority envy. Maybe it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; green monkeys again.
</EM><BR>
<P>Three design-aheads isn't a lot in my opinion.  I often wonder why we
<BR>
don't have a complete atomic resolution design of Eric's protoptype
<BR>
nanoassembler.  I think it comes down to a shift in interests from
<BR>
nanodesign to consequences.  Eric has also pointed out the need to
<BR>
step back from the field to allow others to fill the void (because if
<BR>
you really understand Eric's capacity, you wouldn't go near a field
<BR>
he was &quot;occupying&quot;). You are probably correct about the envy aspects.
<BR>
Even now, you can only look at a few of the top places -- CalTech,
<BR>
MIT, Harvard, Rice, IBM, etc., where the very brightest people work, as
<BR>
beginning to lay the foundations for this field.
