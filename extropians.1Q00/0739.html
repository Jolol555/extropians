<P>
Sasha,
<BR>
<P>I saw &quot;Black Mask&quot; also and though it was extremely corny even by Hong Kong 
<BR>
action film standards I did enjoy the performance by the lead actress who 
<BR>
was quite humorous.  I have read she is considered the Lucille Ball of Hong 
<BR>
Kong!
<BR>
<P>If you want to see an excellent film with normal but very skilled human 
<BR>
beings see &quot;Iron &amp; Silk.&quot;  It is based on the real-life experiences of Mark 
<BR>
Salzman who journeyed to Asia to master the martial arts and is based on his 
<BR>
book of the same title.  I could see Natasha really enjoying this if she has 
<BR>
not already seen it.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
