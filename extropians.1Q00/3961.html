<EM> &gt; &gt;&gt; Better to start briefing John McCain.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;I saw where McCain took a shot at Falwell, Robertson and
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt;Sharpton today.  I may hafta vote for him.  spike
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Yes, with Gore and Bradley to the left and Bush to the right,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; McCain has wisely staked out the center. McCain has also shown the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; most interest as far as Mars is concerned. Add in the fact that
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; he's a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment, and a Vietnam Veteran
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and former POW, and I think we have a winner.
</EM><BR>
<P>RANT MODE ON:
<BR>
He's not a strong supporter of the 2nd Amendment. He is a strong supporter of
<BR>
the 'good gun, bad gun' thin grey line mentality that those who keep giving up
<BR>
ground in appeasement to the gun controllers promote.  He says I have no right
<BR>
to own an AR-15 (a semi-automatic target and hunting rifle) because some people
<BR>
claim it has no 'sporting purpose' (a phrase created by the Nazis in their
<BR>
Riechsgeletsblatt), but that the military does (even though by the strict
<BR>
interpretation that the guncontrollers prefer, every member of the militia MUST
<BR>
own an assault weapon (and who is the militia, but every able bodied member of
<BR>
the electorate)). He says my local government can deny me my right to protect
<BR>
myself because police are supposed to protect me (even though dozens of Appeals
<BR>
and Supreme Court cases have maintained that no police agency has the authority
<BR>
or responsibility to protect individual citizens from crime).
<BR>
He says he's pro-2nd Amendment, but only the way he wants to interpret it.
<BR>
END RANT MODE

<EM> &gt; While the republician party is 25 to 30% social conservatives, it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; is also 15 to 20% social libertarians, a fact the religious right
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ignores.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Welcome aboard, enjoy the ride.... ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm hardly a religious conservative, but I far more prefer the Natural Rights
<BR>
arguments of Alan Keyes to the centrist poll driven moral relativism most major
<BR>
candidates pander to. I voted for Bush in the New Hampshire primary because 
<BR>
as I
<BR>
was waiting in line to vote at least half the democrats were busy changing 
<BR>
their
<BR>
registration to independents just so they could vote for McCain, then changing
<BR>
their registration back to Democrat right after voting, indicating they intend
<BR>
to vote democrat in the fall and were just trying to futz up the GOP process. I
<BR>
went in intending to vote for Keyes, but changed to Bush after seeing how much
<BR>
the Democrats were trying to ambush the GOP process. Its too bad there wasn't a
<BR>
useful holy fool on the Dem side to vote for, I might have changed my
<BR>
registration so I could futze up their process.... ;)
