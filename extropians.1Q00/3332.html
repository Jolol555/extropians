<P><EM>&gt; Stirling Westrup made some enlightened comments about how even the most

<EM>&gt; cruel and sadistic individuals in the future will be seen as &quot;sick&quot; and not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evil and worthy of severe punishments as in our day.  I do feel that some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people commit heinous crimes at least partially from mental illness and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;psychological demons&quot; while others are essentially healthy and simply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choose the wrong choice.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the &quot;happy happy joy joy&quot; world of some people's &quot;good good feelings&quot; idea of
<BR>
the future, all mental illness will be curable at a cost of next to nothing. In
<BR>
such a future, punishment will be even more paramount because nobody will go
<BR>
through life not knowing that they are insane, as they will have a high tech
<BR>
infrastructure that diagnoses them frequently. Refusing to take your medicine is
<BR>
just as concious and responsible a choice for the medicated patient as pulling
<BR>
the trigger of a gun.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In time they may become very mentally ill but they made the choice in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; healthy state of mind to go down that road.  I think with advanced neuronano
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we will be able to look into brains/minds and see what the case is for each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person to give them a fair punishment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Should all criminals be seen as &quot;ill&quot; and be treated and not punished?  I am
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not that enlightened yet and may never be, especially for crimes like murder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and rape.  Perhaps treatment and punishment can be fused together.
</EM><BR>
<P>Depends. Was the individual aware at any time that he/she was 'ill', or had that
<BR>
individual been previously under mental care? If that is the case, then the case
<BR>
can be made that an 'ill' person who is sane while on medication made the
<BR>
concious choice to stop taking medication, and thus assumed full concious
<BR>
responsibility for their actions while insane, just as the drunk assumes
<BR>
responsibility for his DWI or driving accidents when he tips back the first
<BR>
pint.
