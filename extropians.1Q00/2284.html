<EM>&gt; [Jeff Davis doesnt] recall quite how it happened, but the other day a method of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cooling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jupiter brains just popped into my head.

<P>I worked on the orbit mechanics and found that if the material were in
<BR>
the same orbital plane as the planet, then all you need to do is figure
<BR>
out how to stop the rotation of the planet, or rather, tide lock it with
<BR>
the sun.  The material could be rotating in the opposite direction as
<BR>
the planet.  The hole would be drilled on the equator from the dawn
<BR>
side to the dusk side.  The problem then is that any individual particle
<BR>
would not be in the tunnel very long, so it would not pick up much
<BR>
heat.  For instance, assume an earth sized planet [I know you said Jupiter,
<BR>
but assume earthlike planet in an circularized ~earthlike orbit] with
<BR>
particles in a counterrotating circular orbit about a sunlike star with
<BR>
no other planets to mess up the orbit.  Each particle would be in the
<BR>
tunnel only about 20 seconds.  Assuming they went in 50 kelvin
<BR>
cooler than the planet and heat transfer by radiation alone, would come
<BR>
out only a fraction of a degree warmer than it went in.
<BR>
<P>There is another way to do it: get the planet rotating with the axis
<BR>
of rotation parallel to the axis of orbit about the star, and the hole drilled
<BR>
north pole to south.  Then instead of a continuous stream of matter, have
<BR>
discrete chunks of matter orbitting in a plane at some angle to the
<BR>
orbital plane of the planet.  Then it could be arranged for a particle
<BR>
to be in the tunnel longer, but the amount of material available to
<BR>
carry away heat would be greatly reduced.  So, the problem is
<BR>
not so much working out the orbit mechanics as its an ineffective
<BR>
way to carry away heat.  spike
