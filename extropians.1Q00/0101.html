I was distressed this morning to see Robert Owen's comments wanting
<BR>
to distance himself from what he seemed to suggest was the messy
<BR>
muck of politics.  I was pleased to see Eliezer pointing out that
<BR>
we *do* have the painful problem of millions of people a year dying, not
<BR>
knowing that there *are* other options.  So there *is* a moral obligation
<BR>
in my opinion to be actively pro-political.  As I pointed out in the
<BR>
past, perhaps to John -- as much as we may want to save our parents
<BR>
and grandparents we may want to respect their right to &quot;go gently
<BR>
into that sweet night&quot;.  There are many mornings I get up, stare
<BR>
the singularity in the eye and say to myself, &quot;I'm really not going
<BR>
to enjoy this ride&quot;.  And this is from the guy who schleps halfway
<BR>
around the world to watch fireworks in the snow on the eve of the
<BR>
new millennia!
<BR>
<P>Greg is acting as the far-forward lookout scout, bringing our attention
<BR>
to and organizing information for that day we may need to confront the
<BR>
neo-luddites.  We can respect the opposition and their opinions but
<BR>
that by no means implies that we should retreat to the ivory towers
<BR>
of philosophy (grins to Robert...) and sacrifice those who may yet
<BR>
be saved.  And to save them will require awareness, diligence and
<BR>
perhaps action.  While on the one hand we have the New Mind &amp; Body
<BR>
piece in the Wall Street Journal, we also have the all &quot;Natural&quot;
<BR>
products on Swiss Air.  The battles are being waged on just what
<BR>
government researches may do with &quot;our&quot; tax dollars on stem cell
<BR>
research.  Most of us aren't aware of the subtle forces at play.
<BR>
They are little threads wandering through our society, hidden
<BR>
from obvious view.
<BR>
<P>What is the difference between &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot;?  Simply, we offer
<BR>
them the option of making rational choices.  We don't try to dictate
<BR>
what they must do.  And yet, some have seen me argue that &quot;Joe Public&quot;
<BR>
is ill-equipped to make a rational choice between the &quot;Natural&quot; and
<BR>
the &quot;Engineered&quot;.  Those who don't care or don't know must be &quot;told&quot;
<BR>
to fasten the seat belts of their children and perhaps their own.
<BR>
<P>There are paradoxes here, and it is difficult to hold them all.
<BR>
We must begin by putting the information on the table where people
<BR>
can see it and by raising our voices to educate and express concern.
<BR>
Most importantly we must *engage* in the discussion and follow that
<BR>
with action.  Because if we don't, those who do will most surely have
<BR>
the day.  If we have to call that politics, so be it.
<BR>
<P>Robert
