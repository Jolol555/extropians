<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Now everbody's ravin' -- Rave on!Target Extro 5 in 2000? Berkeley, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;California?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;J. R.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So you think the Extropian Institute should host a rave for the students of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Berkeley?  Some of the older extropians on the list may need to be signed up 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for cryonic suspension with a standby team ready for when they collapse 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after some intense dancing!!  Rather then have any totally illegal drugs 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; given out we could have David Pierce of &quot;The Hedonics Imperative&quot; be in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; charge of giving out various nutrients and pharmaceauticals to keep the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crowd dancing!
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, raves with &quot;smart(er)&quot; drugs and some other refinements
<BR>
could be a great way to spread extropian/transhumanist
<BR>
memes. Composing some kick-ass dance music with 
<BR>
transhumanist lyrics (you know, mostly just a few cool
<BR>
sentences that get repeated over and over) could also 
<BR>
greatly help to improve our image and thus attract new 
<BR>
members. We could also have some nerd raves just for 
<BR>
ourselves (so that the cool people won't be scared away). 
<BR>
<P>And after the dance all go (fully stoned) off into the 
<BR>
woods and blow the living crap out of eachother in a 
<BR>
dynamic game of paintball. It doesn't get much cooler 
<BR>
than this...
<BR>
<P>Old bunker complexes would be ideal for such events 
<BR>
(and of course for cryonic storage etc.), btw.
<BR>
Some of these are quite big yet relatively cheap,
<BR>
see: <A HREF="http://www.missilebases.com/missilebases/index.html">http://www.missilebases.com/missilebases/index.html</A>
<BR>
and <A HREF="http://www.missilebases.com/properties/index.html">http://www.missilebases.com/properties/index.html</A> for 
<BR>
example. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This whole idea is kind of cool.  I just hope there are enough women there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and that I can get some of them to dance with me!  I just had junior high 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; flashbacks. :(
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, that's the nice thing about raves; everyone just kind of
<BR>
dances for himself. You're together alone (in a positive way,
<BR>
that is).
