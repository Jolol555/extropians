<P>
<EM>&gt;I've always thought it would be a good idea to take a few pounds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marijuana, break it up into 1000 bags or so, and have 1000 people walk to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the pollice station with a bag each and turn themselves in 1 by 1.. day
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after day after day.
</EM><BR>
<P>At the rate of 1,000 per day, it would take more than five years to equal the
<BR>
number of people already in US prisons.
<BR>
Make no mistake, they would build more prisons, or put the prisoners in tents,
<BR>
as they do in Arizona.
<BR>
<P>*************************************************
<BR>
<P>2 MILLION INMATES, WITH NO SOLUTION IN SIGHT
<BR>
<P>As Americans, we're going to set a dubious mark in about six weeks.  For the
<BR>
first time, more than 2 million of our citizens will be in prison.
<BR>
What that means is that the United States will have more people incarcerated
<BR>
than any other country in the world, large or small, democracy or dictatorship.
<BR>
And, yes, that includes Russia.
<BR>
In just 10 years our prison population has risen by 70 percent.  With 2 million
<BR>
prisoners, we now have one-fourth of the world's incarcerated people.
