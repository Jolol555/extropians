<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Are you so sure that no organic foods are any more healthy than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conventionally grown ones?  Sure enough that you will say that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contrary belief is irrational?  I would think you would have to be an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expert on food to be so sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I'm not sure, and I concede that I'm a non-expert with a big loud mouth.  
<BR>
But nevertheless I maintain that the ''organic'' food movement does exhibit 
<BR>
irrationality.  What *is* organic food ?; to what degree should should food 
<BR>
production techniques use ''organic'' methods to be able to say that the food 
<BR>
obtained thereby is ''organic''; what would an ''organic'' (or ''natural'') 
<BR>
food production technique be ?  Consider a hypothetical farmer producing 
<BR>
apples, and suppose his apples are plagued by a parasite; then, say that to 
<BR>
combat these parasites this farmer instead of a chemical toxic uses a 
<BR>
genetically engineered bug that eats those parasites.  Would that make his 
<BR>
apples less, or more, ''organic'' ?  Say that he decides on using a toxic to 
<BR>
kill those parasites; then if he uses instead of an ''artificially'' produced 
<BR>
toxic (say, from some chemical factory) a more devastating poison extracted by 
<BR>
manual labor from ''organically'' grown funguses, would that make his apples 
<BR>
less, or more, ''organic'' ?  
<BR>
<P>What I'm trying to say is that the very idea of ''organic food'' (and/or 
<BR>
''natural food'') is an irrational, arbitrary and useless belief like a 
<BR>
religious myth.  Ever since the first prehistoric humans started farming 
<BR>
(which, by definition, involves manual, i.e., ''artificial'', selection and 
<BR>
cultivation by humans) instead of just gathering things which have 
<BR>
''naturally'' grown in the forest, the foods we humans eat have NOT been fully 
<BR>
''natural''.  The distinction between an ''organic'' and a ''non-organic'' 
<BR>
food (as I tried to show above through these two examples) is I think 
<BR>
similarly arbitrary and useless.  The commotion about ''organic'' foods is 
<BR>
brought about by the emergence of this arbitrary irrational 
<BR>
''organic-food-is-good'' belief. 
<BR>
<P>I wonder if sometime someone will come up with the idea that algorithms run on 
<BR>
computers constructed from ''naturally produced'' computer parts yield 
<BR>
''better'' results than when run on other hardware ? 
<BR>
<P>Very best greetings,    Menno (<A HREF="mailto:rubingh@delftnet.nl?Subject=Re:%20question%20on%20labelling%20genetically%20modified%20foods&In-Reply-To=&lt;Pine.LNX.3.95.1000109155358.497A-100000@localhost&gt;">rubingh@delftnet.nl</A>)
