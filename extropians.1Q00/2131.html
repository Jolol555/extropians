<P><EM>&gt; It seems pretty clear that HIV-1 and HIV-2 have different evolutionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; histories.  While you may make a case that HIV-1 may have come from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chimpanzees, it looks like HIV-2 came from Sykes' monkey or Mangabeys.
</EM><BR>
<P>Point granted.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Here are the questions to ask:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 1) How much have vaccines contributed to health?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While HIV may be the scourge now, clearly in the '50's Polio was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that caused a great deal of harm.  A brief glance at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Fields Virology indicates that in the early '50's, Polio was paralyzing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10-30,000 people a year.
</EM><BR>
<P>The US polio death rate was ~1/500 of the total US death rate when
<BR>
the vaccine was introduced.  Not a negligible factor, but surely much
<BR>
smaller than many other influences on health.  And the other vaccines
<BR>
had even smaller effects on total mortality.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 2) How much have great apes contributed to vaccines, over and above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; what could have been done with other animals?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also from Field's Virology it seems that the polio virus does not cause
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pathology in mice, only in monkeys and humans.  So it is an open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question whether you could have used anything but primates to develop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a polio vaccine.  Given the costs involved, I suspect researchers only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use primates when there are no other good alternatives.
</EM><BR>
<P>Primates were perhaps needed, but not great apes such as chimps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think you can attribute modern health to three things: (1) sanitation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (2) antibiotics, and (3) vaccines.   ... A fourth factor is the simple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; understanding of germ theory and communicability and getting medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; practicioners to follow practices that minimized transmission.  But these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; factors combined are what has extended average longevity from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ~30-40 years to ~75 years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
This is completely wrong.   I'm lecturing my health economics
<BR>
class on this topic this last week and this upcoming week, and
<BR>
have been reading up on it for fun &amp; preparation.
<BR>
(see Sources for:  <A HREF="http://hanson.gmu.edu/EC496S00.html">http://hanson.gmu.edu/EC496S00.html</A> )
<BR>
<P>Medicine overall seems to have very little effect on health.  This is the
<BR>
usual answer from statistical analyses, and from the few controlled
<BR>
experiments we have.  The mortality rates of most diseases treated by
<BR>
antibiotics didn't change noticably upon the introduction of that treatment.
<BR>
I don't think we have controlled experiments regarding sanitation, but the
<BR>
statistical analyses we do have don't show any effect of sanitation on health.
<BR>
<P>I'd guess that Medicine of all forms probably contributes less than 1 year
<BR>
to that 40 year increase in lifespan.  Since sanitation also doesn't seem
<BR>
that important, it is a big puzzle why exactly lifespan has increased so.
<BR>
It is also a puzzle why the US spends 14% of GDP on medicine.
<BR>
I have theories I've explored a little, but these are definitely open
<BR>
questions.
