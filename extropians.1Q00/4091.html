in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; exchange for goods, and I will exchange goods that I don't need and don't
</EM><BR>
value
<BR>
<EM>&gt; for goods that I would normally have to buy at retail. Since the value of
</EM><BR>
my own
<BR>
<EM>&gt; property to me is my cost, not the retail value, I gain 30-50% just on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transaction on that basis. Many people will give me a good discount as
</EM><BR>
well on
<BR>
<EM>&gt; their goods for doing a barter transaction, on the order of 10-30%. Almost
</EM><BR>
all
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of my computer equipment has been purchased in this manner.
</EM><BR>
<P>This gets very complex, and I'm not a tax accountant, so I can't tell you
<BR>
every detail.  However, it is my understanding that state, local and federal
<BR>
agencies are virtually unanimous in claiming that barter transactions are
<BR>
legally equivalent to monetary transactions.  If a particular transaction is
<BR>
not taxable in the first place it obviously doesn't matter, but if it is
<BR>
taxable you're supposed to pay the tax whether you use money or not.
<BR>
<P>The IRS has labyrinthine rules covering schemes for paying wages via barter,
<BR>
and how you are supposed to calculate the cash value of the goods or
<BR>
services involved.  States with income taxes mostly have similar rules.
<BR>
Sales taxes often don't cover small personal transactions in the first
<BR>
place, but where they do it usually doesn't matter whether cash changes
<BR>
hands or not.  Businesses, of course, are generally expected to collect
<BR>
sales tax even on barter transactions, and once again there are byzantine
<BR>
rules about how you are supposed to calculate cash values.
<BR>
<P>Mind you, a lot of these rules are not well enforced, due to the obvious
<BR>
problems involved in collecting evidence.  However, people who rely heavily
<BR>
on barter to avoid taxes do tend to get prosecuted, especially if the dollar
<BR>
value of the goods involved is large.  In essence, then, using barter may
<BR>
make tax evasion easier to get away with, but it doesn't mean you aren't
<BR>
breaking the law.
