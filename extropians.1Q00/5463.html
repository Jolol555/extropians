I suspect there might be several local extropian minded types that make the 
<BR>
scene for this.  Its on a Saturday, so afterwards maybe we can go do one of 
<BR>
the local eating establishments or something, or if its your pleasure get 
<BR>
into a bar fight. I volunteer to be the designated non-combatant, drive the 
<BR>
getaway car, provide the bandages, etc.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I had no idea what a rough and tumble group of people the extropians were up 
<BR>
close!  Why don't we just drive our hogs to the nearest biker bar(while 
<BR>
wearing our official Extropy Institute black leather jackets) and discuss 
<BR>
the our technophile enthusiasms with the local gentlemen there.  Surely, if 
<BR>
a fight breaks out we will find our 'superior intelligence' makes us better 
<BR>
combatants! lol!  I'm sure Eliezer or someone here has created a martial art 
<BR>
that makes karate pale by comparison!  We just need it instantly downloaded 
<BR>
into our brains at the moment of crisis. ;)
<BR>
<P>I'm glad to hear Spike that you abhor violence and simply want to be a 
<BR>
support to your fellow human beings.  Will you be wearing official Red Cross 
<BR>
markings so you are known as a noncombatant?  Of course, doing this may not 
<BR>
guarantee your physical safety! :)  Perhaps  having extropian women around 
<BR>
would result in a 'leavening influence' upon the rowdy males!
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
