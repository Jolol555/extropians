<EM>&gt; &gt; Right!  You almost said it here Greg.  *Why* do you think this attitude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; has finally changed?  It because we have good battle simulators 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;running...

That works for me.  The good guys are way ahead.  {8-]  Also, that is
<BR>
one rare example of military technology that really does have good
<BR>
commercial spinoffs: faster computers, more programmers, etc.  Take
<BR>
a look at some of the better flight simulators.  You might be impressed
<BR>
<P>with the realism: they sim such subtleties as the moment of inertia
<BR>
coupling, high speed sub-mach buffet, performace loss at altitude, the
<BR>
real performance characteristics of the planes.  Perhaps this will
<BR>
eventually be seen as a first step in creating sims good enough to
<BR>
fool an uploaded human.

<BR>
<P>Training for war has been revolutionized (and will be MUCH more so in the 
<BR>
future) by computer simulators.  My girlfriend's father just got his orders 
<BR>
to move to California where he will help lead a force of 'bad guys' to teach 
<BR>
visiting units how to fight by trouncing them.  He is so happy about it(or 
<BR>
could it be that he won't have to see me anymore?)!  Of course, simulators 
<BR>
will be used a great deal and are considered a cheaper and still effective 
<BR>
method of training armored units.
<BR>
<P>We have all read how the military has approached the Hollywood wizards of 
<BR>
special effects and computing to make much more realistic simulations and 
<BR>
have been warmly received.  From what I understand it is the infantry now 
<BR>
who will be addressed to really get ultra-realistic sims, since armor, naval 
<BR>
vessels, and aircraft have long the beneficiaries.
<BR>
<P>I never thought of an arms race in simulators!  It does make sense though.  
<BR>
This will make the gap between developed nations and those not so even 
<BR>
greater.  We should offer a simwar to Saddam the next time he threatens to 
<BR>
get out of line but then that guy is extremely dense.
<BR>
<P>One thing that makes me angry about the U.S. and European 
<BR>
military-industrial establishments is that we are willing to sell the rope 
<BR>
that later may hang us in the name of profit!  I have read that the pentagon 
<BR>
to an extent even 'encourages' this so that when a possibly hostile nation 
<BR>
gets a near-current weapons system, the pentagon can then say to congress, 
<BR>
&quot;we must have more funding, they're catching up!!&quot;  In the end, our 
<BR>
needlessly dead troops in some foreign land could be the losers.

Wouldn't it be great if we could pass an international law that said
<BR>
that nations had to fight their wars in simulators?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>It would be but do you remember the 'Star Trek' episode where two warring 
<BR>
peoples have computers keep track of casualties and if your area is hit you 
<BR>
MUST report to your local desintegrator chamber??  Count me out!  Of course, 
<BR>
Kirk fell for a local gal and blew up the computers.  He dared them to 
<BR>
continue the war for real!
