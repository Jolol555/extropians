<P>
I have followed avidly the posts about a nanotech-gift economy.  Seeing the 
<BR>
varying ideas from Robin, Damien, Greg and Robert gave me some new 
<BR>
understandings.
<BR>
<P>I feel a more grounded after the points made about how raw materials, energy 
<BR>
and designs will not be free as in the classic utopian scenario.  It makes 
<BR>
sense to me that open-source programming is at an obvious disadvantage in 
<BR>
terms of resources used to develop it and get it used by the masses.  But as 
<BR>
Robin said, an early nanotech economy is much easier to predict.  His 
<BR>
comment that even with manufacturing and design costs removed we would have 
<BR>
70% of the cost remaining wzs rather sobering!
<BR>
<P>Still, considering how powerful computers are supposed to be by 2030 and 
<BR>
later, I see common people if given the chance developing capable designs on 
<BR>
their own due to the huge A.I. power they would be wielding.  Of course for 
<BR>
this to be the methods and principles of nanoassembly would have to be 
<BR>
well-understood so the capable software could be developed.
<BR>
<P>The question is will governments allow their people access to such powerful 
<BR>
A.I. and the nanotech replicators we all want?  As I said in a previous 
<BR>
post, I see powerful reasons for governments to wish to restrain access to 
<BR>
the common people.  This could be a huge civil liberties question of the 
<BR>
next century.
<BR>
<P>There would have to be powerful safeguards or you could a twisted individual 
<BR>
or group cause mass carnage before being stopped.  I wonder how open-ended 
<BR>
the software and hardware would be?
<BR>
<P>Damien wrote:
<BR>
Many of the services ancillary to today's production and distribution 
<BR>
wouldevaporate if anything like anything boxes were plentiful, however
<BR>
circumscribed by protective regulation. What, then, are the salesstaff
<BR>
selling? What goods are being carefully stored and moved long distances?Who 
<BR>
fill the skyscrapers doing what? What vast trucksrumble over the bigbridges? 
<BR>
Feedstocks? Maybe, but modestly smart nano systems might well copewith what 
<BR>
suddenly becomes a provision of services on the order of pipingin water and 
<BR>
power and pipingousewage. (And even those will surely behandled nearer to 
<BR>
home, ideally by nearly-closed recycling).
<BR>
(end of post reproduction)
<BR>
<P>At the stage of relatively mature nanotech allowed by the government to be 
<BR>
shared with the common person; yes, I see this scenario happening.  
<BR>
Salespeople would sell designs and the reputation of their corporation.  
<BR>
Advertising would be more important then ever.  I do agree that production 
<BR>
(at least light manufacturing) and distribution would be hit hard.  We would 
<BR>
still need executives of many types to coordinate corporate activity in the 
<BR>
skyscapers.  Even more white collars over design and advertising and much 
<BR>
fewer over manufacturing and distribution.
<BR>
<P>Again, this is a scenario for a relatively mature nanotech that government 
<BR>
has allowed at least to a degree into the public's hands.  Of course like 
<BR>
Damien said this is all predicated on technological progress not stalling in 
<BR>
some crucial area and as I have pointed out not having the government use 
<BR>
it's power to stop &quot;anything boxes&quot; from getting into the hands of the 
<BR>
people.
<BR>
<P>In Robert's post I was impressed to learn that these horribly expensive 
<BR>
chip-making plants could be used for other then their original goal.  I had 
<BR>
read articles painting a very bleak picture with no bright side to it.
<BR>
<P>As for a doubling in market price for a halving in unit cost, I hope to see 
<BR>
this principle applied to the moller skycar so I can be zipping around in 
<BR>
one a decade from now for the price of a midsize car and not a yacht.
<BR>
<P>The view of three main steps in the development in nanotechnology was 
<BR>
eye-opening for me.  I think of nanotech always as the third form, molecular 
<BR>
assembly.  With the three-legged stool approach to nano it will take some of 
<BR>
the farfetched nature off it and as you said appeal to more and varied 
<BR>
groups of people.  And in time these forms of nanotech will merge.
<BR>
<P>&quot;Bloating&quot; in the nanotech age will definately be accellerated.  Just as 
<BR>
someone can buy software with the promise of getting a free upgrade later 
<BR>
on; I see companies that design for nanotech doing the same thing.
<BR>
<P>It sounds like &quot;Salvation Army&quot; will become very upscale in the future! lol  
<BR>
Things &quot;bludgeoned&quot; together in the old ways just may have that special 
<BR>
antique allure to them.
<BR>
<P>It is interesting to see that just as in the past, energy efficiency will 
<BR>
still be extremely important.  And nature once again happens to show us the 
<BR>
way in microorganisms.
<BR>
<P>I read the various posts I have commented on several times to try to soak up 
<BR>
what was there.  I wish I had the time to do this for most of the posts 
<BR>
here.  How nanotech will change our economy and society to me is endlessly 
<BR>
fascinating.
<BR>
<P>Again, what concerns me more about nanotech then even the technology is the 
<BR>
matter of whether our governments allow us free (or at least mostly free) 
<BR>
access to it.
<BR>
<P>As I stated in my last post I am very concerned that federal governments 
<BR>
will feel that for our own good these technologies (especially as they 
<BR>
improve and mature) should be utilized directly only be licensed corporate 
<BR>
and government bodies.
<BR>
<P>The excuses for this could range from wanting to prevent terrorism to 
<BR>
keeping a nanotech chernobyl accident from happening in someone's home.  
<BR>
Ulterior motives could be to maintain strong corporate control of the 
<BR>
economy and government control of society at large.
<BR>
<P>We see right now a fight going on for open-source code.  We see battles 
<BR>
going on in the U.S. and elsewhere over civil liberties.  Won't nanotech 
<BR>
(especially as it matures) be the ultimate example of powerful institutions 
<BR>
wanting to control access to technology to control the people??  I see this 
<BR>
as a much bigger question then even the development of the technology itself 
<BR>
which now seems very likely.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
