<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; You can be opposed against transhumanism and the things we hold dear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; without being fanatic about them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ...but not without being stupid.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not at all. I can imagine intelligent and well-educated non-stupid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people opposing transhumanism too, based on their values and knowledge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of how the world functions. 
</EM><BR>
<P>In other words, these otherwise intelligent people have some blind
<BR>
spots of ignorance which cause them to act contrary to their own 
<BR>
enlightened self-interest (which is what transhumanism is all about).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They are in many ways more troublesome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than fanatics.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, they can be very annoying indeed, but at least they don't go 
<BR>
around blowing stuff up...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For example, imagine a sociologist who has studied the incidence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burnout in our society who comes into contact with transhumanist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking. He will point out that the psychological effects of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tremendous changes and speed-ups we are proposing will lead to burnout
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and psychological distress on a massive scale, maybe so much that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society will desintegrate. The transhumanists will of course claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that this will be fixed by technology , the adoption of transhumanist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thinking and self-help as well as reconfigurations of human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychology. But the sociologist, drawing on his knowledge base in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social psychology and history, will regard this hypothesis as highly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unlikely to occur, in fact less likely than the hypothesis that this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just transhumanists defending their own worldview (you can do a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; completely correct Bayesian analysis of this situation and come to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this conclusion - given the priors of the sociologist). We of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have slightly different information, and regard the first possibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as more likely (even if we should always ask ourselves how much is due
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to possibility two). So in the end he will disagree with us and if he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; considers us dangerous, try to move against us.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In the above example both sides could try sharing their analysis and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; facts, trying to make an analysis together both could agree on.  
</EM><BR>
<P>The man in the above example clearly lacks some crucial data.
<BR>
He is a specialist, and has trouble with looking beyond his own
<BR>
narrow field of interest. He can't see the big picture, lacks 
<BR>
vision. A very common problem (even on this list). Anyway, your 
<BR>
example only seems to confirm that all opposition to transhumanism(*) 
<BR>
is either based on incomplete information (or even disinformation) 
<BR>
or on the failure of the subject to process correct and complete 
<BR>
information logically. Therefore, this kind of criticism is of
<BR>
little practical value (and it certainly isn't &quot;intelligent&quot;).
<BR>
I've yet to see relevant, intelligent opposition to core 
<BR>
transhumanist ideas.
<BR>
<P>(*) a desire to overcome the limitations of the human condition 
<BR>
by means of reason, science and technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even worse is if the basic values differ - a person valuing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eternal and unchanging would be opposed to us in principle, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but since the natural state of things (the world, the universe) is
<BR>
far from eternal and unchanging, that person would still need transhuman
<BR>
technologies to realize his dream. What sweet irony...
