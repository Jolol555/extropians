<EM>&gt; &gt;How would you define &quot;efficient and equitable&quot; distribution of the dumped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;grain?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Efficient and equitable distribution is obviously getting the grain to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; millions of people who are starving.  Granted this is much easier said than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done.  But you'll never convince me that letting it rot and dumping is more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; efficient or more equitable than giving it, or selling it at &quot;cost&quot; to those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who most need it.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have a strange and rather arbitrary definition of &quot;efficient&quot; (and
<BR>
&quot;equitable&quot; for that matter).
<BR>
<P>That you will &quot;never be convinced&quot; suggests a position that is not
<BR>
rational in its basis.  In fact, dumping *is* more efficient and to the
<BR>
benefit of *everyone* in the long-term than doing as you suggest.  I would
<BR>
hardly call forcing a farmer to sell their grain at or below cost to be
<BR>
&quot;equitable&quot;; it sounds like theft to me.  Also, who will pay for the cost
<BR>
of distribution, which is substantial?
<BR>
<P>Your proposed solution would destroy the agriculture industry within five
<BR>
years, and then no one would have cheap grain.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes I agree that the bulk of the problem with hunger in the 3rd world is the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lousy governance going on over there.  But how would it hurt the grain 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market here to give the grain to countries that can't afford to buy it?  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>You have not taken the economics into consideration.  This is what really
<BR>
happens with the current &quot;free/subsidized&quot; grain shipments to poor
<BR>
countries:
<BR>
<P>Usually, most of the &quot;free/cheap&quot; grain sent as aid to foreign countries is
<BR>
resold on the open market by those countries.  However, because these
<BR>
countries got the grain for below cost, they can undercut the prices of
<BR>
the American producers who gave them the grain to begin with.  The net
<BR>
result is that all the cheap/free grain is destroying the grain producers
<BR>
by artificially pushing the open market prices to levels that do not
<BR>
reflect the cost of production and in some cases are pushing US producers
<BR>
out of markets that they should legitimately have.  This is what your
<BR>
brand of meddling in the free market has done in the past.  
<BR>
<P>I don't see how you could legitimately condone this kind of market
<BR>
manipulation, given that it eventually makes grain less available and more
<BR>
expensive for everyone.  This really is a case of the free market being as
<BR>
efficient as is possible, thank-you-very-much.  
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Seems to me such a program might even be good for the US grain market
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the  long term.  Because if you give them a freebie while they're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; down on their  luck, by the time they are ready to buy they may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely to by from us rather than Europe, no?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Those &quot;freebies&quot; aren't free.  TANSTAAFL and all that.  The grain
<BR>
producers pay for it on the open market and in many cases lose money
<BR>
because of these policies.
<BR>
<P>They are likely to buy US grain anyway, based on cost and quality alone. 
<BR>
Grain is a commodity; countries usually buy from the lowest bidder unless
<BR>
they have laws that prevent them from doing so (which is relatively
<BR>
common).
