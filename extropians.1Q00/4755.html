&nbsp;The fact that the SSRI Prozac works on the brain in 
<BR>
&nbsp;a similar fashion as the violence-inducing drug PCP, 
<BR>
&nbsp;which is also an SSRI, makes the following findings 
<BR>
&nbsp;reported in London's Observer not too surprising:

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Spiral of violence blamed on Prozac
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugs in Britain: special report
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Anthony Browne, Health Editor
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Sunday March 12, 2000
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Observer
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Prozac, the world's best-selling anti-depressant, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is being blamed for turning healthy, placid people
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;violent. It is thought to have led to crimes that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;include murder.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical research to be published soon will show that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;up to one in 10 adults who take Prozac can become
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;belligerent and pose a risk to others and themselves.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The study is the strongest vindication yet of mental
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;health campaigners, who claim dozens of people have
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;been wrongly imprisoned because of the effects Prozac
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has had on their behaviour. In the US, school shootings
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have been linked to number of children given Prozac and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;other anti-depressants.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the first clinical trial of its kind, Dr David
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Healy, director of the North Wales Department of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Psychological Medicine at the University of Wales, gave
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prozac to a volunteer group of mentally healthy adults
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and found even their behaviour was affected. He said:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'We can make healthy volunteers belligerent, fearful,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;suicidal, and even pose a risk to others.'
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Healy says between one in 20 and one in 10 people who
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;take Prozac can be affected by akathisia, whereby they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;become mentally restless or manic and lose all
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inhibitions about their actions 'People don't care
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;about the consequences as you'd normally expect.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They're not bothered about contemplating something they
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would usually be scared of,' he said.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;The study is a potentially devastating blow for the US
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drug company Eli Lilly, which has made millions from
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Prozac. In a statement last night the company said:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'Since its discovery in 1972, Prozac has become one of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the world's most studied drugs. An extensive review of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;scientific evidence has demonstrated no causal link
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;between Prozac and aggressive behaviour.' Previous
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;studies linking Prozac to violence have been
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;discredited because aggressive behaviour could be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;caused by patients' personality disorders, not the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drug. Healy's study is the first to show Prozac can
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;affect even healthy individuals.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pam Armstrong, co-founder of the Counselling and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction helpline, said: 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'I have come across a huge number of cases, from 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;bizarre behaviour to aggression.'
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Stephen Bryson, a surgical nurse, was prescribed Prozac
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;after a close friend died, and his associates were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;alarmed by his increasingly bizarre behaviour. 'I was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;swearing, touching friends up in private parts and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would pick arguments for the sake of it and threaten
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;their lives. I ran around town stark naked and ran up
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;debts of £10,000. I became quite violent,' said Bryson.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'I had no awareness of ... right from wrong. I was high
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;as a kite.'
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Bryson eventually attacked his partner with a knife.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;'He was saved by the bell. If the phone hadn't rung, I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would have killed him.' Bryson was given a 12-month
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;jail sentence. Three months after ditching Prozac, he
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;was 'back to my old self'.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Ramzia Kabbani, who set up the Prozac Survivors Support
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Group a year ago, said: 'People are going to prison for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;what amounts to medical negligence. If they're throwing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the book at vulnerable individuals, they should be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;throwing the book at the doctors who prescribe the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;medicine as well.'
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, the widespread use of anti-depressants and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;easy availability of guns is thought to be responsible
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for mass killings. Eric Harris, 18, from Columbine High
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;School in Colorado, who last year shot 12 fellow
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;students and a teacher, had been taking Luvox, similar
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to Prozac. In 1998 Kip Kinkel, 14, killed his parents
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;before going on a shooting spree at his high school in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Springfield, Oregon, killing two and injuring 22. He
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;took Prozac.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Last month a US judge in Connecticut acquitted a bank
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;robber who blamed his behaviour on Prozac. In what is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;thought to be the first ruling of its kind, Superior
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Court Judge Richard Arnold freed Christopher DeAngelo,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a 28-year-old insurance agent, because the defendant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;was unable to appreciate his actions were wrong.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Defence lawyer John Williams said: 'This was someone
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;who was driven to commit crimes because of prescription
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;drugs.'
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Eli Lilly said it has been successful in helping defeat
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;70 other cases where alleged criminals blamed their
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;behaviour on Prozac. However, Healy said: 'Eli Lilly is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;legally trapped. They might like to admit that Prozac
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;causes violence, but they could open themselves up to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;all sorts of claims.'
