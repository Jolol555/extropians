<EM>&gt; A server is set up offshore. On this server is housed a sophisticated
</EM><BR>
barter
<BR>
<EM>&gt; exchange.  The way it works is simple.  If you have something to sell, you
</EM><BR>
post
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it online.  The catch is your selling your identity to the buyer for 300
</EM><BR>
'barter
<BR>
<EM>&gt; units'.  'Barter units' are fictitious units of value that are measured by
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; consensus of the people on it.  If you want to sell that used VW of yours
</EM><BR>
for a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; million barter units that's your business.  Keep in mind that another
</EM><BR>
individual
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is selling his brand new Lexus for 5000 barter units, so you're likely
</EM><BR>
never
<BR>
<EM>&gt; going to sell that used VW of yours.
</EM><BR>
<P>What you've actually done in this scheme is create a completely electronic
<BR>
floating currency system with only one bank (the 'barter' site).  Most
<BR>
governments won't let you do that, but I'm sure you could find someplace
<BR>
that would.  Once you cross that hurdle, though, you're doing exactly the
<BR>
same thing that Ebay already does.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The barter exchange company is very careful to maintain that these barter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; units are not currency, only an arbitrary measure of value online to
</EM><BR>
facilitate
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the barter process.
</EM><BR>
<P>That is all that any currency is.  The only unusual feature is that the
<BR>
value is allowed to float freely, instead of being tied to the supply of
<BR>
some physical good.  Which reminds me - you're going to have to somehow
<BR>
create an initial supply of 'barter units' (call them BUs) for people to
<BR>
spend, and some way for people to get an initial allocation of them.  That
<BR>
leads straight into the money-supply problems that all floating currency
<BR>
systems have to deal with (i.e. how many BUs do you start with, how quickly
<BR>
do you make more, how much currency does it take to get some, etc.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The question of the night is, with the easy and availability of public-key
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encrypted schemes for both users and the transaction of these fictitious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;units&quot;, what's keeping people from capitalizing on such a fantastic idea?
</EM><BR>
If
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the exchange assesses a mere 1% unit acquisition on each barter, the
</EM><BR>
exchange
<BR>
<EM>&gt; stands to make a considerable amount of units for themselves to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barter with.
</EM><BR>
<P>How about the fact that it doesn't offer any particular benefit to most
<BR>
people?  Small-time traders can avoid taxes even on dollar-denominated
<BR>
trades, and businesses can't get away with avoiding taxes in the long run
<BR>
even if they try this scheme.  If the dollar were less stable it might make
<BR>
sense as a private currency, but right now that isn't the case.
<BR>
<P>In essence, in order to compete with Ebay and the like you need some
<BR>
advantage for the customer that offsets the extra trouble of dealing in BUs
<BR>
instead of his native currency.  There isn't an obvious one, which is
<BR>
probably why no one is doing it.  If you can find a non-obvious advantage,
<BR>
then you may have something.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since it is conducted offshore and identities of all the participants are
</EM><BR>
only
<BR>
<EM>&gt; made available to matched buyers and sellers, how can it be taxed?
</EM><BR>
<P>The same way any other international transaction is taxed.  I don't know
<BR>
about other countries, but in the US a citizen is required to pay tax on
<BR>
income earned in other countries.  Obviously it is easy to hide an
<BR>
occasional transaction, but the same is true of Ebay.  Businesses, however,
<BR>
have to file so many cross-referenced documents that it would be virtually
<BR>
impossible to hide participation in such a scheme, and if they admit to
<BR>
participating then they would have to pay income tax.
<BR>
<P>You do get to avoid sales taxes, of course, but again so does Ebay.  Being
<BR>
offshore might help if the states succeed in spreading sales taxes to the
<BR>
internet, but then again it might not (what if the feds decide it counts as
<BR>
a real international sale, with all the attendant import/export hassles?)
