<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Mental modifications could turn out to be ultimately the most jarring to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others.  Remember in Star Trek episodes where McCoy and others are bothered 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by Spock's vulcan emotional control? 
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with this. Some people become very worried when others do not
<BR>
react the way they do (perhaps the best and funniest treatment is the
<BR>
scene in Sterling's _Distraction_ where one character becomes
<BR>
hysterical at the protagonist because he refuses to be upset by an
<BR>
assassination attempt).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I could see similar situations when some people decide to maintain a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strict control over their emotions to block out possible pain or for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; added focus in their life.  Others might move their emotional range
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the opposite direction.
</EM><BR>
<P>And since people tend to invest a lot of the way their emotions work
<BR>
into their self-image, they tend to get upset when they see radical
<BR>
alternatives. This is also my theory why some people become so upset
<BR>
about immortalism - it threatens *their* self images since they
<BR>
involve an acceptance of death. Of course, this behavior may not
<BR>
remain after some cognitive optimization... :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What could be very disturbing is when people decide to &quot;turn off&quot; their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conscience to do ethically malicious things.  Of course drugs and alcohol 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been used for centuries in this way.  Not just by individuals but also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments and militaries.
</EM><BR>
<P>To take an example that came up in my &quot;Big ideas&quot; sf campaign: a
<BR>
business leader being questioned about whether he had done some
<BR>
illegal things, and answered turthfully: &quot;I have no recollections of
<BR>
ever having done so, and I consider the act deeply immoral!&quot;. But
<BR>
earlier he had been much less ethical, and deliberately created an
<BR>
ethical &quot;Dr. Jekyll&quot; personality that had no memories and had very
<BR>
different values, and a &quot;Mr. Hyde&quot; personality with no such
<BR>
inhibitions that appeared at certain points or in certain
<BR>
situations. So he could continue his unethical dealings without his
<BR>
conscious knowledge. Of course the real problem here is juridical: is
<BR>
he guilty of his crimes, or a victim of mental insanity? Is it a crime
<BR>
to do this kind of restructuring? Should Mr. Hyde be punished but not
<BR>
Dr. Jekyll?
<BR>
