I think many of us have had this idea at one time or another.  The idea
<BR>
raises some problematic questions, the biggest of which, IMO, is probably
<BR>
this:
<BR>
<P>Assuming for the sake of argument that the big-mind hypothesis is right,
<BR>
what, if anything, does this imply that we ought to do differently, in
<BR>
light of this fact?
<BR>
<P>The answer to this question would imply answers to other important
<BR>
questions, like:  Does it matter if we can (dis)prove that this idea is
<BR>
right or not? If so, how would we begin to do so?  Does it matter what
<BR>
goals the big mind has?  If so, how would we begin to figure them out?  
<BR>
Given that we have some goals, can we make use of the big-mind idea to do
<BR>
some work?  Does it matter which goals we have?  How would we get the
<BR>
big-mind working on them?  Would these strategies hold even if there was
<BR>
no big mind? ... etc.
