'What is your name?'  'Eliezer S. Yudkowsky.'  'Do you deny having written 
<BR>
the following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Given both the technological difficulty of achieving simultaneous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfect uploading before both nanowar and AI Transcendence, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sociological difficulty of doing *anything* in a noncooperative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environment, it seems to me that the most rational choice given the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Otter Goals - whatever they are - is to support the creation of a Sysop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mind with a set of goals that permit the accomplishment of the Otter Goals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, there's a significant probability that the momentum-goals will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overridden by God knows what, but (1) as I understand it, you don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe in objectively existent supergoals and (2) the creation of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seed AI with Sysop instructions before 2015 is a realistic possibility;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; achieving simultaneous uploading of a thousand-person group before 2015
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why not get into space as fast as possible while working on the seed just
<BR>
as fast as possible?
<BR>
<P>Nanowar is a dangerous possibility, but, you know, life on Earth is
<BR>
dangerous.  Space, on the other hand, is comparatively boring and safe.
<BR>
Moreover, it's not at all obvious why you couldn't work on building your
<BR>
seed from space via radio.
<BR>
<P>You both concede the unstoppability of the other's enabling technologies.
<BR>
d.Otter thinks the first Mind would have good reason to strike first; if
<BR>
so, you're SOL anyway you look at it.  Any Mind bent on the destruction of
<BR>
all other potential Minds (especially one with access to nanotech, which
<BR>
seems pretty darn likely,) is going to hunt you down and have its way with
<BR>
you.  Uploading isn't likely to help matters much; the AI will be way
<BR>
ahead of you.
<BR>
<P>So getting into space won't help much against an AI, nor will it make
<BR>
coding the seed significantly easier/more difficult, but it will help a
<BR>
lot against all the other dangerous unpredictables you'll find at the
<BR>
Earth's surface.
<BR>
<P>Finally, we note that totally different specialists will be working on
<BR>
getting us into space from those who will be working on the seed.
<BR>
<P>So AI and space travel are totally compatible goals.  d.Otter may have
<BR>
good reasons to not want you to build the seed at all, but that's a
<BR>
totally unrealistic thing to hope for.  So where's the argument left?
<BR>
