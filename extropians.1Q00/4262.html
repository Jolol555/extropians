<EM>&gt; &gt; Herrstein and Murry, pointed out that people cannot all be treated
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; same way, because each person is in individual with inherent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; biological differences.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps I am mistaken but I got the impression they were dealing
</EM><BR>
with racial
<BR>
<EM>&gt; more so than individual differences. My comment must be taken in
</EM><BR>
context. It was
<BR>
<EM>&gt; directed at their apparent ulterior motives to support their own
</EM><BR>
conservative
<BR>
<EM>&gt; extreme right wing memes, as I understood from the post to which I
</EM><BR>
responded.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm against &quot;us vs them&quot; memes and rhetoric as being dividing and
</EM><BR>
promoting
<BR>
<EM>&gt; strife.
</EM><BR>

<P>The reason why it is called the Bell Curve is because it is about
<BR>
differences, differences between all kinds of groups, even brothers.
<BR>
The authors made the hard decision to include the racial data, despite
<BR>
the hate publishing that information would draw for a reason.  And the
<BR>
is because leftists interpret the fact that some racial groups do not
<BR>
do as well as others, as proof that America is racist.  As it turns
<BR>
out IQ has more to do with success; than race, education, or social
<BR>
economic background.
