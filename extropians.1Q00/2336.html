<P><EM>&gt; However, it did flesh out the relevancy of your &quot;academic&quot; citation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Titles and affiliations are not the point, tho, are they?

<EM>&gt;

<P>This brings up an interesting point.  While many academic journals
<BR>
do a fairly even handed job, there are lots of examples where they
<BR>
don't.  Probably every writer has a horror stories such as Amara
<BR>
recently pointed out.  And then of course you have things like
<BR>
the &quot;Society for Cryobiology&quot; and their journal Cryobiology.
<BR>
While they may be very good academics you wouldn't stand a chance
<BR>
of getting any serious work related to cryonics published in
<BR>
that journal.  Not because the science wouldn't be good enough
<BR>
but because they are so against the basic premises.
<BR>
<P>As Robin points out, any organization is likely to have its &quot;agenda&quot;.
<BR>
Journals often have review boards that are made of people who know
<BR>
each other and think similarly.  If you get someone from a different
<BR>
field, they may look at a paper published in a &quot;peer&quot;-reviewed Journal
<BR>
and view it as garbage because it doesn't take into account information
<BR>
from outside the narrow field on which the journal is focused.  I
<BR>
suspect this problem will only get worse as journals go after narrower
<BR>
and narrower fields of science.  Its only when you bring in something
<BR>
like &quot;Crit&quot; that allows anyone to comment on the material that you
<BR>
break through this limit.  Then of course that requires that the
<BR>
Journals be online and available for anyone to peruse.
<BR>
<P>We still have a way to go before we can get to the next level in
<BR>
knowledge production.
