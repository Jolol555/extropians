<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;The claim that  &quot;I am one person who is living one life&quot; is sufficiently
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt; well-justified in terms of physical facts as long as you don't start
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;messing with Xeroxes or  uploads.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but I was under the impression that messing around with such things
<BR>
was what we were talking about.
<BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;However, there is no way you can extend this to the latter  cases, without
</EM><BR>
<EM>    &gt;opening the door to all kinds of paradoxes and ambiguities
</EM><BR>
<P>Like what? I can think of all sorts of very strange things that would
<BR>
result, strange because they are outside my experience, strange because
<BR>
up to now only one chunk of matter in the entire universe has the John Clark
<BR>
property, but strange is not the same as illogical, I know of no paradoxes
<BR>
involved.
<BR>
<P><EM>         &gt;&gt;Me:
</EM><BR>
<EM>         &gt;&gt;Only one way to tell, ask them. I'll bet you already know what they'll say.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>    &gt;They will both claim to be the original person.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, I think you're right.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt; Which shows that the claims of either one are either false or meaningless
</EM><BR>
<EM>     &gt;(I say the latter).
</EM><BR>
<P>How does it show that?  Of course nobody will ever be able to prove that the claim is
<BR>
true or false, just as I can't prove I'm not the only conscious being in the universe,
<BR>
but the claim has meaning and is as clear as any other statement about the self.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>    &gt;I am a human being, and human beings are  physical objects,
</EM><BR>
<P>Not me. I am not an object, I am a process.
<BR>
<P><EM>     &gt;made of matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Matter (and energy) are generic but we know from personal experience that
<BR>
minds are not. Unless you believe in mumbo jumbo about an immaterial soul then
<BR>
the only thing left that could possibly make one mind different from another is
<BR>
information. Information can be duplicated.
