</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ammendment prohibiting access to extropian enabling technologies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (risk=0.125-0.20)....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and I chose this case because it illustrates what almost
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly is the Achilles' heel of Extropianism -- namely the dependence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on technology access to and utilization of which it cannot control.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is questionable.  Since most of the technologies are moving to
<BR>
smaller and smaller scales, the Achilles' heel is mainly one of timing.
<BR>
Bova dealt with the issues of &quot;state control&quot; over access to prolongevity
<BR>
research and technology in his recent book on Immortality.  I'd cite
<BR>
most of his arguments that the genie is out of the box and even extreme
<BR>
attempts at putting it back in the box will do nothing more than slow
<BR>
it down.  It would take a massive nuclear war or a meteor impact to radically
<BR>
impact the development rate.  Even some of the more radical things I think
<BR>
about doing, only bring forward the technology development curve 2-3 years.
<BR>
<P>One of the good things about Extropian-use technologies, is that they
<BR>
are the same technologies required to develop good defenses against
<BR>
things like Anthrax-B, so we get to leverage off of common sense
<BR>
defese stratagies and technologies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What this suggests to me is not a need for political action but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consideration of the possibility of private ownership of the requisite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology by an incorporation of Transhumanist interests. If you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reply that this leaves the possibility of expropriation by the State
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; open, I must agree.  But at what point do we desist from the pro-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jection of possible impediments and get on with it?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is being discussed.  It is also being examined from the framework of
<BR>
how to deal with possible efforts by states to regulate the technologies.
<BR>
<P>Given the relative efforts involved in (a) political activism vs.
<BR>
(b) controlling and developing technologies, I'll take (b) every
<BR>
time.  However, there are transhumanists/extropians whose skill base
<BR>
lies more in the arena of (a).  Given that fact, I do not see it
<BR>
as counterproductive for those who are skilled with word duels and
<BR>
debates of the legal/judicial kind to push on that front, while
<BR>
those of us with a more technical mindset use our skills equally
<BR>
appropriately.
<BR>
<P>We must keep in mind that we are dealing with people who have been
<BR>
programmed with memes, the acceptence of which they generally did not
<BR>
have conscious awareness of.  So their &quot;agenda&quot; is potentially harmful
<BR>
for both us *and* them.  We would be highly &quot;un&quot;-extropic if we were
<BR>
to take our toys and go play elsewhere if we could reasonably devote
<BR>
some energy to &quot;free the minds&quot; of those individuals.
