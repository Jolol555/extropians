From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com?Subject=Re:%20SPACE:%20The%20Case%20for%20Mars&In-Reply-To=&lt;200002221501.HAA03657@well.com&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com</A>&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Zubrin has clearly done his homework and clearly makes a valid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;case for Mars being perhaps the first place we should go on a long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;term &quot;occupation&quot; basis.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;However(!), he seems unaware of (or avoids) two key areas: AI and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;He mentions nanotechnology once in the book, classifying it with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other &quot;wishful&quot; technologies such as Faster-than-Light travel
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Oooppps...). AI is also avoided, so it isn't clear whether or not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he has thought very seriously about Moore's Law.  Since he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discusses terraforming Mars over 100-1000 years, he doesn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have much awareness of the singularity.  Biotech is mentioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;only in passing.  Thats the bad news.
</EM><BR>
<P>Zubrin is aware of both AI and Nanotechnology, but he is a &quot;get out
<BR>
the wrenches and build it now&quot; kind of pragmatist, in other words,
<BR>
an engineer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;His treatment of rocket fuel synthesis, chemical engineering, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;orbital dynamics are first rate however.  His philosophy is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;clearly libertarian and growth oriented but he seems to limit his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;concept of humanity to the standard issue human bodies.  Many of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;his economic arguments for colonizing Mars disappear if we even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get minimal AI for human worker equivalence. He mentions using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;space based solar collectors as a key requirement for accelerating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terraforming (but doesn't take it the next level that I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for using their exponetial growth to dissassemble the planet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entirely.)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So, if Zubrin's perspective is typical of the average case for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mars individual, we have fertile ground for the Extropian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;philosophy, they just need to have their vision expanded a little.
</EM><BR>
<P>He has this Extropian bending his ear at every opportunity.
<BR>
<P>So suppose we send a crew on to Mars, and during their journey the
<BR>
singularity occurs.
<BR>
<P>Just for fun we zot a nanoprobe ahead of them to Mars, and instead
<BR>
of arriving at a cold dead world, thay arrive to explore a lush
<BR>
blue/green world instead.....
<BR>
<P>What fun!
