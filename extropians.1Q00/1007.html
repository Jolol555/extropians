<EM>&gt; &gt;Can you clarify what form of child abuse these stats relate to, physical 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or sexual? I suspect that there is a large gender difference in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perpetrators, with the majority of child sexual abuse being at the hands of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;males.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;These stats refer to all abuse. Of course, identical forms of abuse may get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recorded as &quot;sexual&quot; abuse when a man does it, and &quot;physical&quot; abuse when a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;female does it. Furthermore, the general public tends to perceive abuse by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;men
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as more serious than identical abuse by females, which may partly explain 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;females comprise only 3% of those in prison for this crime, despite the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that females commit twice as much child abuse as do men.

I recall that my father, a major disciplinarian who took his army experience 
<BR>
as the model for how a family should be structured, was really quick with a 
<BR>
slap if I &quot;mouthed off,&quot; but would be appalled at seriously injuring me or 
<BR>
any child, I'm certain.  My mother, on the other hand, an early elementary 
<BR>
teacher by profession, once took virtually all the skin off my back, going 
<BR>
through an entire large stack of fresh pine boughs in the process.
<BR>
My sin was that I forgot that I wasn't supposed to leave the yard.  My 
<BR>
mother thought that I was faking having poison ivy lesions on my fingers in 
<BR>
order to avoid piano practice, which she forced me to endure for years, 
<BR>
although I had no talent and a cut nerve in one hand that precluded me from 
<BR>
ever being really good.  So she punished me by forbidding me from leaving 
<BR>
the yard.  But I forgot and wandered over to the neighbors.
<BR>
But... she didn't have the advantage of piano lessons when she was a kid, by 
<BR>
God!  So I had better be grateful - or else.  My dad found me with my entire 
<BR>
back covered in blood and bandaged it.
<BR>
... It is common in many primitive societies to let the women torture the 
<BR>
captives, as they are both better at it than men and also seem to enjoy it 
<BR>
more.
<BR>
... I also recall that on the half-dozen or so times that I have been 
<BR>
seriously in danger of being murdered (I live a somewhat strenuous life..) 
<BR>
it was always a woman, usually trying to convince some man to do it for her. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A couple of times, however, it was the woman herself.  I can't recall ever 
<BR>
initiating any violence against a woman, however.
<BR>
It's also worth noting that the sexual crimes against minors for which men 
<BR>
are often incarcerated would not be crimes in other jurisdictions.  Often 
<BR>
they are purely based on arbitrary age limits.  On rare occasions, women 
<BR>
have been prosecuted for the same offences, but I suspect that the 
<BR>
percentages are in line with the other stats quoted in this thread.
<BR>
... Then there are the gay bars that I used to see a bit of as a cab driver 
<BR>
in the '70's and mid'80's.  The lesbian bars were ten times as violent as 
<BR>
the gay mens bars.
<BR>
o'well - the point, I believe, has been made.  The same culture, however, 
<BR>
that puts people in cages for years for using the wrong inebriate, that 
<BR>
ignores a male prison rape rate much higher than the total number of rapes 
<BR>
committed against women throughout society, is not likely to recognize these 
<BR>
kinds of truthes until it hits them in the pocketbook, as M.L.King realized.
