<P><EM> &gt; I guess you missed my irony. I agree with you, but despite the fun logical tricks
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; of people like John Clark, an upload created from a scan is NOT the same individual
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; as the individual who was scanned.
</EM><BR>
<P>How can you say that? You sure can't compare that to the Real
<BR>
Thing(tm), because it's gone (the scan was destructive).
<BR>
<P>And in the hypothetical case you could create an exact clone, you're
<BR>
of course know that it bifurcates (gives rise to two individua) as
<BR>
soon as it is allowed to evolve (unless these are exactly synched
<BR>
deterministic clones receiving exactly the same input, which is a
<BR>
hypothetical in machina-only scenario).
<BR>
<P>This is all as clear as mud. I wonder what logical tricks you speak of.
