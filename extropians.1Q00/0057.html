<EM>&gt;&gt;This is a work in progress.  As you can see, I've developed three categories
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;of opponents of transhumanist values and goals: 1) Greens, 2) Religious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Groups and 3) Hate Groups and Opponents of Liberty. I would appreciate help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;from the list in compiling this list. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Those who work to educate others about transhumanism do us all a great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;service and those who work toward eradicating misconceptions do an equal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;benefit to transhumanity.  I'm glad you are also taking on the challenge of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;researching and revealing groups that can and do oppose our beliefs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In that your work is in progress and you will be specifying particular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;examples and issues within groups that oppose our views, I do have two
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thoughts:  (1) Using a political group as a target to oppose may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;overbroad, unless, however, the group is unarguably vindictive.  In that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was once a Green Party electee and a transhuman at the same time, I cannot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agree with you that Greens (in general) are a threat to our culture.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the alarmist environmentalists and alarmist anti-genetic engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advocates that are ridiculously and arrogantly obtuse.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'm still both a registered Green and a transhumanist; and while 
<BR>
I have little expectation of the Greens becoming a serious political 
<BR>
party  I feel a need to distance myself from the ruling  parties, and 
<BR>
am not ready to embrace a  Libertarian agenda.  Not all questions 
<BR>
about genetically engineered crops have been answered, and it may 
<BR>
still be possible to make technological errors that  lead to 
<BR>
environmental disaster.  Like Natasha, if I understand her correctly, 
<BR>
I reject the ignorant alarmists without rejecting rational 
<BR>
environmental concerns.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that many opponents of transhumanism reject it out 
<BR>
of ignorance and fear, and need to have their real if mistaken 
<BR>
concerns rationally addressed.  Lumping them all together as 
<BR>
&quot;enemies&quot;  and thereby placing them beyond hope of any real dialogue 
<BR>
seems to me to be politically mistaken.   I hope Greg's excellent 
<BR>
page will evolve from an &quot;enemies list&quot;  into a resource in which 
<BR>
those with honest concerns can find both the answers to their 
<BR>
questions and
<BR>
reassurance about our  sincerity.
