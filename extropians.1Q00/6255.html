What's Hot!
<BR>
-----------
<BR>
DRUG TO CONTROL INFLAMMATION MAY INCREASE ODDS OF SURVIVING HEART FAILURE
<BR>
More than four million Americans suffer from congestive heart failure
<BR>
(CHF); about half will survive five years. Researchers now say chronic
<BR>
inflammation may play a role in the disease. When the body senses it is
<BR>
under attack from foreign substances, the immune system releases
<BR>
complement proteins, antibodies and white blood cells to fight the
<BR>
invader. Tissues not receiving enough blood can also cause activation of
<BR>
complement proteins. Complement activation results in a series of
<BR>
reactions known as the complement cascade, byproducts of which can lead to
<BR>
destruction of tissue.

<BR>
<P>BRAIN SITE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR TRIGGERING OVEREATING
<BR>
Collaborating researchers at the Oregon Health Sciences University in
<BR>
Portland, Oregon and the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta
<BR>
(Canada) have identified an area in rat and mouse brains that may control
<BR>
eating. Located within the hypothalamus, the area of the brain that
<BR>
controls many aspects of behavior including food intake, the study
<BR>
unearthed individual neurons that are believed to serve as an &quot;adipostat&quot;
<BR>
or fat thermostat. Since dieting, starvation, and other eating patterns
<BR>
have seemed to affect the body's fat storage, metabolic rate, and energy
<BR>
output, experts have long believed that there must be a mechanism that
<BR>
regulates food intake and weight.

Protocols
<BR>

<BR>
COMMON COLD
<BR>
The common cold is caused by over 300 serologically distinct viruses
<BR>
belonging to many groups such as rhinoviruses and adenoviruses. Since
<BR>
there are so many different types, it is impossible to develop a single
<BR>
vaccine effective against them all.  The common cold is spread by airborne
<BR>
droplets from an infected person breathing, coughing, or sneezing. Viruses
<BR>
will not stay alive on inanimate objects long enough to be a problem, as
<BR>
on a phone for instance. The droplets must be inhaled. Infection is
<BR>
dependent upon three important aspects; virulence of the organism,
<BR>
inoculation size of the organism, and host resistance.
<BR>
In 1971, Linus Pauling carried out a meta-analysis of four
<BR>
placebo-controlled trials, concluding that it was highly unlikely that the
<BR>
decrease of common cold symptoms in vitamin C groups was caused by chance
<BR>
alone. Studies carried out since then have found that high doses of
<BR>
vitamin C alleviate common cold symptoms, indicating that the vitamin does
<BR>
indeed have physiologic effects on colds. However, despite the large
<BR>
number of placebo- controlled studies showing that vitamin C
<BR>
supplementation alleviates the symptoms of the common cold, widespread
<BR>
skepticism about vitamin C persists. A cup of hot tea taken one hour
<BR>
before consuming vitamin-c and an immune-boosting formula containing
<BR>
thymus may help at the very first sign of a cold.

<BR>
<P>JET LAG
<BR>
Fatigue will occur in a person who travels across multiple time zones. It
<BR>
usually takes one day to recover from each time zone that is crossed.  The
<BR>
person will be worn out and tired for days after arriving at his
<BR>
destination. Fatigue is usually accompanied by a lack of concentration and
<BR>
motivation. It's hard to deal with an activity that requires effort or
<BR>
skill, such as driving, reading, or discussing a business deal. Poor
<BR>
concentration, insomnia, daytime sleepiness, slowed reflexes, indigestion,
<BR>
hunger at odd hours, irritability, depression, lack of resistance to
<BR>
infections, headaches and muscle aches, mood disturbance, and loss of
<BR>
mental efficiency are other symptoms of jet lag.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>DEPRESSION AND DHEA TRETMENT
<BR>
DHEA is the only hormone besides cortisol that has consistently been
<BR>
linked with depression. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) turns into both
<BR>
estrogen and testosterone. It was studied as far back as the 1950s as an
<BR>
antidepressant. Back then, researchers reported that it gave people energy
<BR>
and confidence, and made them less depressed. While it seemed to work
<BR>
great, no one followed up on the original studies.
<BR>
DHEA emerged on the scene again in the 1980s when interest in anti-aging
<BR>
hormones geared up. It was noted then that anti-depressant activity was
<BR>
part of DHEA's overall anti-aging benefits. Then, in 1996, a report
<BR>
suggested that DHEA's antidepressant effects might be direct, and not just
<BR>
part of its overall anti-aging effect.  In the late 1990s, DHEA's
<BR>
mood-enhancing effect was confirmed in a study from the University of
<BR>
California at San Diego.
<BR>
DHEA also has anti-stress effects that may be part of its antidepressant
<BR>
action. Research shows that cortisol, the stress hormone, is elevated in
<BR>
major depression. DHEA counteracts cortisol.

<BR>
<P>PROSTATE ENLARGEMENT  (BENIGN PROSTATIC HYPERTROPHY)
<BR>
Saw palmetto has multisite mechanisms of action including inhibition of
<BR>
binding of DHT to androgen receptors in prostatic cells. In the prostate
<BR>
gland, saw palmetto interferes with conversion of testosterone to the more
<BR>
potent cell proliferating metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Saw
<BR>
palmetto decreases DHT concentrations in enlarged prostate tissues of
<BR>
treated patients. A marked decrease of epidermal growth factor, associated
<BR>
with DHT reduction, has also been observed. These biochemical effects,
<BR>
similar to those obtained with Proscar, are particularly evident in the
<BR>
periurethral region, where enlargement is responsible for much of the
<BR>
urinary obstruction seen in BPH.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>ANXIETY AND STRESS
<BR>
Conventional treatments for anxiety and stress include psychotherapy and
<BR>
medication. There are two types of psychotherapy: behavioral therapy and
<BR>
cognitive-behavioral therapy.
<BR>
Antidepressants are frequently used in combination with behavioral therapy
<BR>
to mitigate anxiety and stress. The two major classes of antidepressants
<BR>
are selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as Zoloft and
<BR>
Prozac, and tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), such as Elavil and Tofranil.
<BR>
Regular exercise including running, walking, and strength training three
<BR>
times a week for 20 to 60 minutes has been shown to have a positive effect
<BR>
on mental health.
<BR>
An extract of a deep sea fish, the garum, Adapton is a naturally occurring
<BR>
substance. Adapton contains omega-3 extract and is thought to contribute
<BR>
to stress-reducing effect. It functions at the cellular level to increase
<BR>
energy efficiency, resulting in improved concentration, mood, and sleep
<BR>
while promoting a general sense of well-being.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-011.shtml">http://www.lef.org/protocols/prtcl-011.shtml</A>
<BR>
<P>CONSTIPATION
<BR>
Most individuals with uncontrolled constipation develop a variety of
<BR>
symptoms, ranging from large bowel pain, rectal discomfort, abdominal
<BR>
fullness, nausea, anorexia, and a general feeling of malaise. These people
<BR>
feel like they never completely evacuate their bowels. Severe chronic
<BR>
constipation may be accompanied by fecal impaction resulting in severe
<BR>
diarrhea, ulceration of the colon, and intestinal obstruction. 
<BR>
Nutrients that induce healthy colon peristalsis work best when taken on an
<BR>
empty stomach. One combination is 4 to 8 grams of vitamin C powder and
<BR>
1500 mg of magnesium oxide powder taken with the juice of a freshly
<BR>
squeezed grapefruit. A convenient product sold by several vitamin
<BR>
companies is a buffered vitamin C powder product that contains magnesium
<BR>
and potassium salts mixed with ascorbic acid.

Product of the Week

<BR>
MEGA SOY EXTRACT
<BR>
MEGA SOY EXTRACT represents a major breakthrough in the prevention of
<BR>
cancer, osteoporosis, and a host of age-related diseases...via the health
<BR>
benefits of soy. 
<BR>
MEGA SOY EXTRACT provides more than twice the amount of dietary soy
<BR>
isoflavones typically consumed in Japan, where breast and prostate cancer
<BR>
are very low. 
<BR>
Menopausal symptoms and the incidence of osteoporosis also are reduced
<BR>
among those who consume soy. And one study shows that soy isoflavones
<BR>
promote an anabolic effect on bone density in post-menopausal women by
<BR>
binding to the estrogen receptors in bone tissue. 
<BR>
For general disease prevention purposes, one capsule, twice a day is
<BR>
suggested. Women seeking to use higher doses of the new soy extract for
<BR>
the phytoestrogenic effects should take two to three capsules, twice a
<BR>
day. 
<BR>
FOR CANCER
<BR>
Soy extracts have become very popular in the last few years as an adjuvant
<BR>
(assisting) cancer therapy. In fact the scientific literature makes a
<BR>
strong case that all cancer patients should take soy supplements. Treating
<BR>
cancer, however, is not simple, and some cancer patients are less likely
<BR>
to benefit from soy, while others should not use it at all. 
<BR>
Those considering soy extract supplementation should remember that it is
<BR>
not a cancer cure. It does have documented anticancer benfits that may
<BR>
work synergistically with other conventional and alternative cancer
<BR>
therapies. Please refer to the Cancer Treatment Protocol before using MEGA
<BR>
SOY EXTRACT as an adjuvant cancer therapy.
