<EM>&gt; &gt; Right.  Launching from a high altitude allows you to use a lighter

<EM>&gt; &gt; aeroshroud, but buys you surprisingly little other than that.

<EM>&gt; of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rocket- the expansion area ratio can be far higher, and the thrust goes

<EM>&gt; up dramtically for the same mass flow rate.  This implies an increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Isp- which reduces the mass ratio needed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, Doug is right again, damn him.  {8^D  The Isp of the shuttle goes
<BR>
from 3500-ish on the deck to about 4500 m/sec in vacuum if memory
<BR>
serves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The overall thermodynamic efficiency of rockets can be as high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as 50% -the kinetic energy of the total mass at high velocity is half of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the chemical energy of the fuels on the launch pad
</EM><BR>
<P>Now youve given me something to think about, Doug.  The classic
<BR>
rocket equation rule of thumb is that by the time you reach a delta
<BR>
vee equal to your exhaust velocity the remaining mass is 1/e times
<BR>
the initial mass, so in that sense the rocket is at best 37% efficient.
<BR>
<P>My notion was not exactly Carnot efficiency, at which the typical
<BR>
rocket does really well, since its peak temperature is so high.  Your
<BR>
cold gas thruster example shows why I say this: the carnot efficiency
<BR>
of cold gas is great, but the Isp is anemic.  The cold gas thruster does
<BR>
a great job of converting what little bit of energy is there, which isnt
<BR>
much (what is a typical  vac Isp of cold N2?  800 m/sec?  Cold
<BR>
hydrogen would be better, if you ignore the weight of the tank).
<BR>
<P>The skyhook idea allows a theoretical cheap lift, so long as you
<BR>
ignore the practical difficulties.  There would be less structure
<BR>
required, since you need no aerodynamic shroud, etc.  The biggest
<BR>
real world difficulty of a skyhook is one I seldom see mentioned:
<BR>
that planes and satellites would hit it.  Furthermore, it isnt a free
<BR>
ride at all.  When a payload is lifted, the center of mass of the
<BR>
cable is lowered, so unless you figure out a way to lift the CM
<BR>
back to geo the entire structure starts to drift east.  spike
