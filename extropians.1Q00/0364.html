<EM>&gt; Wasn't something like that already done?  The green revolution or some

<P>EvMick is right, there was a Rice Institute, in the Philipines I believe.
<BR>
It was I believe supported by the Rockefeller Foundation among others.
<BR>
It did develop very high yield rice strains, in part my making them
<BR>
&quot;shorter&quot; (i.e. grow faster, devote less energy to stalk production).
<BR>
They did require higher fertilizer levels which contributes to the
<BR>
high cost of &quot;commercial&quot; agriculture, contributes to ground water
<BR>
polution, algae blooms, ecosystem disruption, etc. that Eugene mentions.
<BR>
<P>I'm with Eugene that &quot;Agriculture&quot; as it is currently practiced (both
<BR>
the Natural/Organic and Commercial varieties) is about to get turned
<BR>
on its head.  This is a straightforward consequence of knowing the
<BR>
genetic programs of all of the food crops and animals and the developing
<BR>
ability to create designer species.  Its going to be back to the days
<BR>
of the wild-wild west and it will be interesting to see how governments,
<BR>
consumers, wealthy &amp; poor react to all of the coming changes.
<BR>
<P>Regarding the comments of whether or not current consumers are behaving
<BR>
&quot;rationally&quot;, I think we have been kidnapped by an inertia effect.
<BR>
Many of the people on the list are probably too young to remember the
<BR>
'60's and '70's when early environmental movement was just getting
<BR>
started.  Back then, it was true that industry was really laying
<BR>
waste to the commons (air, water, etc.).  The environmental laws were
<BR>
tough to get enacted and industry resisted them tooth and nail.  However
<BR>
the benefits are quite clear.  We still aren't quite there yet with
<BR>
air quality in some of the cities, but the technology for fixing
<BR>
this is in the pipeline.  However, we have the problem that environmental
<BR>
&quot;quality&quot; is a very loosely defined thing.  The general impression that
<BR>
people have is that if some is good, more is better.  That may be *true*
<BR>
to some degree, but it ignores the problem of diminishing returns and
<BR>
increasing costs for incremental improvements.  My suspicion is that
<BR>
you should have a careful analysis of the marginal costs &amp; benefits
<BR>
of each level of environmental milestones and implement each successive
<BR>
level only as the economy grows enough to support those additional
<BR>
quality improvements.  But this type of analysis is very hard.
