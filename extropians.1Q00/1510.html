<P>Not usually.  Most of the responses you see during disease are your
<BR>
body directly trying to rid itself of the pest.  Temperature (change
<BR>
environment, speed up metabolism), inflamation (attract more
<BR>
white blood cells to the infected areas), coughing (trying to get rid of
<BR>
debris resulting from engulfed and immobilized invaders), etc.

<P>The aspect of our genetics that is designed to minimize transmission
<BR>
is our pheromones.  You get attracted to people with different
<BR>
pheromones to allow immune system differences to prevent the spread
<BR>
of &quot;immune-type&quot; adapted diseases.  [Side note to Damien -- perhaps
<BR>
the problem is that all the Aussies have similar pheromones and so
<BR>
it is difficult for those inter-personal passions to take control?
<BR>
I'd suggest a move to Singapore or Hong Kong for some gene pool
<BR>
mixing...]

<P>It is generally considered true in microbiology that a very virulent
<BR>
(rapidly spreading, causing high rates of death) organism is a new
<BR>
entry and highly maladapted.  The best organisms, esp. viruses are
<BR>
those that evolve a stealth strategy.  Over time they evolve decreased
<BR>
pathology which promotes extended transmission.  Thus, disease
<BR>
producing organisms &quot;attenuate&quot; so as to become relatively unnoticed
<BR>
guests rather than annoyances to be thrown out of your house.
