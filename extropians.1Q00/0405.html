<EM>&gt;Most of the rich stay rich, most of the poor stay relatively poor, same as
</EM><BR>
it ever was.
<BR>
<P>I don't understand what you're saying. My question was: who will invest
<BR>
heavily in developing a magic mill that makes copies of itself for free?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It takes time to ship things through space.
</EM><BR>
<P>In the long run, feed stocks might be obtained in situ and gadgetry made so
<BR>
small or ubiquitous (Ufog, etc) that not much bulk needs to be shipped. But
<BR>
that's the longer term, and I need a path to widespread nano equal to the
<BR>
path from early spreadsheets to Office that can be stolen and burned or
<BR>
copied to multigig drive in seconds. I guess you're saying that in the
<BR>
meantime ancillary industries will still thrive - transport, etc - but
<BR>
those are not the ones who'd be needed to *invest* in making nano happen.
<BR>
(In an update, I've sketched Zyvex's and Ntech's plans, which seem
<BR>
plausible: build a clunky thing, then a better small thing, then a wicked
<BR>
cool smaller thing, etc, and sell them sequentially for the benefits they
<BR>
bring to existing productivity. And have enough money in yr swag at startup
<BR>
that you can afford some mistakes and missed targets.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; Once you have a working matter compiler, you can share out the job of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; writing the programs to a hundred million nano hackers on the Internet.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But there are nowhere near 10^8 people doing this, or even capable ofdoing
</EM><BR>
it. More like 10^3
<BR>
<EM>&gt;or 10^4 worldwide (a guess).
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but I'm supposing that advanced nano code-bootstrapping might happen
<BR>
at a time when a billion or so people are on the net. Even so, maybe I
<BR>
should change that to `a hundred thousand' or `a million'. Realistically, I
<BR>
guess it should be `a thousand'. :(
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; machinery (MEMs). He notes, as we saw above, that shrinking the scale of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; superconductors,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think you mean &quot;semiconductors&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, my clumsy bad. I'm pumping this draft out fast, will tidy later.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt; In the immediate future, Whitesides expects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; impacts from inexpensive microtechnology rather than nano. For example, he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; predicts that instead of a newspaper `you might buy a sheet of paper; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; back side of it would be a battery, the front side of it would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; display. You read it, scroll to find reference works on it, see animated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; illustrations, and when you're done, you throw it away.'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This already exists (it's not a prediction), but it's too expensive to
</EM><BR>
throw away.
<BR>
<P>That is, it *doesn't* exist yet (in the form he envisages).
<BR>
<P>Thanks for comments, folks.
