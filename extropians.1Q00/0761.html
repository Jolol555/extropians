<EM>&gt;Oh, now, don't be such a stick in the mud.  Wouldn't you really love

<EM>&gt;for the EI to have the funds to do a single 60 second spot during

<P><P>Well, that would be nice,but, of course, I was not, in my previous post, 
<BR>
referring to commercials, per se. I was referring to surrepititous/hidden 
<BR>
commercials that shape our ideas about the world.
<BR>
I think it likely that powerful interest groups pay money to persons in the 
<BR>
media and entertainment industries in order to have their constituents 
<BR>
painted in a favorable light.
<BR>
The most likely suspects are those interest groups that have a large chunk 
<BR>
of personal income and are well organized. I am not sure whether this is 
<BR>
good or bad, or should be allowed or whatever, but I do think that people 
<BR>
should be aware of it.
