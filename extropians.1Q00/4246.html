<EM>&gt; we talk about, and none of us even thinks it the least bit... strange?  It's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this, friends: most all of us here must have some mental architecture that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is wired seriously different,
</EM><BR>
<P>No, Spike, I think I have to disagree.  My feeling in interacting with
<BR>
Eric D. or Robert F. isn't that they are &quot;different&quot; from myself, but
<BR>
simply that they connect the dots much faster.  Because of that the
<BR>
conclusions they draw &quot;seem&quot; different.  So it is not so much what you
<BR>
believe that is important, but the rate at which you can accept or reject
<BR>
logical arguments.  If you make the dots very close together and draw the
<BR>
lines very slowly between them, I don't think anybody is going to fail to
<BR>
follow.  Those who do are invoking &quot;invisible&quot; lines and must simply be
<BR>
written off.  Those who accept &quot;real&quot; lines may be redeemable and you
<BR>
should work with them on getting the &quot;ah ha's&quot; as long as possible.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There must be something about each of us that causes a closer introspective 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; look at the changes technology will make to society and the individual.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I suspect it is a willingness to give up loosely cemented beliefs
<BR>
or a willingness to ignore the pressure of society for the pressure of
<BR>
&quot;logic&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It must be a combination of imagination and intellectual curiosity.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I can see how because many of you by being engineers, scientists and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer specialists would be here but it does take more then just that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or we would have many more people on this list.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, you have to allow that many simply aren't aware of us.  Others don't
<BR>
have the time or energy to get involved.  There is also a very subtle
<BR>
distinction between the engineers/computer people &amp; the scientists.
<BR>
One group puts things together, the other group takes things apart.
<BR>
People who put things together simply want to make something that
<BR>
works (and if they can see how to do that, it doesn't matter how
<BR>
complex it is).  People who take things apart are generally constrained
<BR>
that those things be &quot;simple&quot;.  But if you look at science, it seems
<BR>
clear that things aren't setup to be fundamentally &quot;simple&quot;.  So
<BR>
the perspective seems very &quot;iffy&quot;.
<BR>
<P>More than other things, I think Extropians are people who value
<BR>
rational thought over preconceptions.
