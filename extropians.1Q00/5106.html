<BR>
<P>FETAL NEURAL TRANSPLANTS OFFER HOPE FOR PARKINSON'S
<BR>
Parkinson's disease causes stiffness, tremors, poor balance and other
<BR>
neurological symptoms, partially due to a progressive loss of
<BR>
dopamine-producing cells. Drugs to boost dopamine levels help but may
<BR>
become less effective after five years. Pioneering research, reported in
<BR>
the journal Neurology, shows embryonic dopamine-producing pig cell
<BR>
implants have decreased symptoms in some patients.

<BR>
<P>HEART PATIENTS DON'T TAKE ASPIRIN AS OFTEN AS APPROPRIATE             For
<BR>
just a penny per day, patients with coronary artery disease could drop
<BR>
their heart attack risk by one third. Yet nearly three quarters of
<BR>
patients with a history of angina or heart attack do not take aspirin on a
<BR>
regular basis. While aspirin use has increased, researchers at
<BR>
Massachusetts General Hospital say more heart patients could benefit from
<BR>
the inexpensive, effective drug.

<BR>
<P>INSOMNIA
<BR>
Sleep is not a static condition but actually a fluid condition with
<BR>
changes occurring through the sleep period. These stages demonstrate
<BR>
different brain wave patterns. In particular, the period of so-called
<BR>
rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is when we dream. There are about five
<BR>
periods of REM during the night. The deepest periods of sleep, stages 3
<BR>
and 4 occur earlier in the night. It is the deeper phases of sleep which
<BR>
decrease in duration as we age.
<BR>
To find the cause of insomnia one first attempts to find out whether it is
<BR>
initiation maintenance of sleep that is the problem. One looks for the
<BR>
more common insomnia precursors, such as stress related factors. An
<BR>
increase in caffeine consumption includes not only tea and coffee, but
<BR>
carbonated beverages as well. Shift workers often have a problem resetting
<BR>
their biological clock to deal with a topsy turvy schedule. The use of
<BR>
alcohol as a sedative before bed can have the opposite effect resulting in
<BR>
further impaired sleep. 
<BR>
A common cause for insomnia in people over the age of 35 or 40 is
<BR>
deficiency of the hormone melatonin. Melatonin is the hormone released by
<BR>
the pineal gland that induces drowsiness, and enables the body to enter
<BR>
the deep-sleep patterns characteristic of youth.

<P>DOWN SYNDROME
<BR>
Down syndrome (DS) is one of the most frequent congenital multiple
<BR>
handicaps, occurring in 1 to 2 of every 1000 births. It is characterized
<BR>
as a chromosomal disorder, resulting in mental retardation and physical
<BR>
abnormalities. People born with DS have an extra chromosome, making three
<BR>
of a kind, known as trisomy. Ninety-five percent of all DS cases are
<BR>
caused from trisomy 21. People with this type of trisomy disorder
<BR>
generally live until their 30s or 40s. Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome) is
<BR>
characterized by delayed physical and mental development, with numerous
<BR>
physical abnormalities. Trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome) occurs in 1 of every
<BR>
3000 births. It is characterized by severe mental retardation and facial
<BR>
abnormalities. Other possible defects are cleft lip or palate, missing
<BR>
thumbs, webbed hands, clubfeet, heart defects, and genitourinary defects.
<BR>
Survival for more than a few months is rare. Trisomy 13 (Patau's syndrome)
<BR>
occurs in 1 of every 5000 births. It is characterized by severe mental
<BR>
retardation along with brain and eye defects. Other abnormalities may
<BR>
include cleft lip or palate, heart and genitourinary defects, and
<BR>
malformed ears. More than 80% of babies born with trisomy 13 do not
<BR>
survive past the age of 1 year.
<BR>
Children with DS who were supplemented for the first three years of life
<BR>
with a combination of vitamin B6 and 5-hydroxytryptophan improved in
<BR>
social maturity and accomplishment.

<BR>
<P>EMPHYSEMA AND CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE
<BR>
There are several lung diseases collectively known as Chronic Obstructive
<BR>
Pulmonary Disease (COPD), including asthmatic bronchitis, chronic
<BR>
bronchitis (with normal airflow), chronic obstructive bronchitis, bullous
<BR>
disease, and emphysema. About 11% of the population of the United States
<BR>
suffers from COPD, with the disease becoming increasingly common among
<BR>
older women. According to the Mayo Clinic, COPD kills 85,000 people a year
<BR>
in the United States. 
<BR>
The incidence of emphysema, the fourth leading cause of death in the
<BR>
United States, is up more than 40% since 1982. Emphysema ranks fifteenth
<BR>
among chronic diseases that contribute to limitation of physical activity.
<BR>
About 44% of those with emphysema report that their daily activities have
<BR>
been limited by the condition. According to the National Jewish Medical
<BR>
and Research Center in Denver, this chronic lung disease kills 13,000
<BR>
people a year in the United States alone, but up to 2.4 million Americans
<BR>
are estimated to be suffering from this debilitating condition. Emphysema
<BR>
permanently enlarges and irreversibly damages the alveoli, damages the
<BR>
ends and walls of the smallest bronchioles (the tiny breathing tubes that
<BR>
branch off from the trachea and bronchi), and diminishes the elasticity of
<BR>
the lung.

<BR>
<P>FEMALE HORMONE MODULATION THERAPY
<BR>
Concern about the life-threatening side effects of synthetic hormone drugs
<BR>
has caused many women to be deprived of the benefits of safe, natural
<BR>
hormone replacement therapy. 
<BR>
Proper hormone modulation can prevent degenerative disease and improve
<BR>
functioning in both the physical and emotional spheres of life, both at
<BR>
menopause and throughout life. For example, many sexual &quot;dysfunctions,&quot;
<BR>
including lack of desire can be mitigated when hormone levels are
<BR>
naturally restored to a youthful profile. Menopause might also be delayed
<BR>
and less traumatic if hormone adjustments are made in time. Numerous
<BR>
female health problems are tied to inadequate hormone balances, as we will
<BR>
show. 
<BR>
Forty-five million women are menopausal in the United States today;
<BR>
another 3.5 million women will become menopausal this year. Based on life
<BR>
expectancy trends, women face the prospect of spending the last one-third
<BR>
to one-half of their lives in a state of hormonal imbalance. The quality
<BR>
and quantity of life for these women will be determined by how well they
<BR>
(and their doctors) manage their hormone replacement.

<BR>
<P>CHOLESTEROL REDUCTION
<BR>
Elevated cholesterol is associated with a greater than normal risk of
<BR>
atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease. While antioxidants can inhibit
<BR>
cholesterol from oxidizing onto the linings of the arteries, knowing and
<BR>
controlling your cholesterol levels is still an important step in
<BR>
preventing cardiovascular disease.
<BR>
Low Density Lipoprotein (LDL) is called the &quot;bad&quot; form of cholesterol. LDL
<BR>
carries most of the cholesterol in the blood, and the cholesterol from
<BR>
LDLs is the main source of damaging accumulation and blockage in the
<BR>
arteries.
<BR>
High Density Lipoprotein (HDL) is called the &quot;good&quot; form of cholesterol.
<BR>
HDL picks up and transports cholesterol in the blood back to the liver,
<BR>
which leads to its elimination from the body.
<BR>
The following factors appear to have the greatest impact on cholesterol
<BR>
levels: heredity, diet, weight, age, sex, alcohol and stress.
<BR>
Curcumin , also known as turmeric root, an ancient spice in the ginger
<BR>
family, is gaining attention for its positive impact on a number of
<BR>
diseases, including cholesterol reduction. Scientific evidence has been
<BR>
building since the mid 1980s of curcumin's potential cholesterol lowering
<BR>
capabilities.

======================================================================
<BR>
<P>LIPAEN (CLA) 
<BR>
Conjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is a potent antioxidant, anti- carcinogen,
<BR>
and anti-catabolite, as well as a powerful immune system enhancer. The
<BR>
effect of CLA in preventing cancer is very specific. CLA is more powerful
<BR>
than any other fatty acid in modulating tumor development. CLA reduces or
<BR>
stops the negative effects of catabolism.
<BR>
CLA is the component of red meat that has been shown to prevent cancer.
<BR>
The FDA has published research attesting to the anti-cancer properties of
<BR>
CLA. CLA is used by body builders to drive glucose into muscle cells to
<BR>
produce anabolic effects. Dieters use this same sugar burning mechanism to
<BR>
prevent serum glucose from turning into body fat. The new CLA oil is about
<BR>
50% stronger in the cis-9, trans- 11, isomer (which scientists consider
<BR>
the most active isomer). 
<BR>
The CLA fraction is over 70% in the new CLA compared to 60% in the
<BR>
previous version. CLA is listed under the ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS section.
