<EM>&gt; &gt; See, now that's just what I mean!  There isn't any of this great,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dramatic indecision and hesitation.  The correct choice is usually an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; order of magnitude better than any alternative, and obviously so; I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; recall only one or two major decisions in my life when this was not the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; case, and neither of them were transhumanism-related.  (And hey, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; make the wrong decision, you make the wrong decision.  Obsessing over it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; won't help.)  I read _Great Mambo Chicken_ when I was eleven, and I did
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not &quot;decide&quot; that my life would be about ultratechnology; I simply knew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that it would be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; There was never a point, in all my life, where I could have plausibly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; refused the quest.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You too? I think the same holds true for me - I have as far as I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember (plus some supporting evidence from my parents from earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; periods) been aimed at space, ultratech and going beyond the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human. Beside some theme music I have never noticed anything like the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call to adventure, I guess either we are both suffering from poor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scriptwriting, have a modernist script not using the monomyth
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structure, or our lives so far have only been the beginning of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; story and the call to adventure is in our future.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course, we still don't know if the genre we are living in is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science fiction, thriller or socialist realism... :-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Both of you?  Well, I guess you're not special like me.  A few years ago, an
<BR>
SI from the future contacted me, gave me a choice*, and the rest is future
<BR>
history.:)
