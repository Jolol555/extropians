<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; To take an example that came up in my &quot;Big ideas&quot; sf campaign: a
<BR>
&nbsp;business leader being questioned about whether he had done some
<BR>
&nbsp;illegal things, and answered turthfully: &quot;I have no recollections of
<BR>
&nbsp;ever having done so, and I consider the act deeply immoral!&quot;. But
<BR>
&nbsp;earlier he had been much less ethical, and deliberately created an
<BR>
&nbsp;ethical &quot;Dr. Jekyll&quot; personality that had no memories and had very
<BR>
&nbsp;different values, and a &quot;Mr. Hyde&quot; personality with no such
<BR>
&nbsp;inhibitions that appeared at certain points or in certain
<BR>
&nbsp;situations. So he could continue his unethical dealings without his
<BR>
&nbsp;conscious knowledge. Of course the real problem here is juridical: is
<BR>
&nbsp;he guilty of his crimes, or a victim of mental insanity? Is it a crime
<BR>
&nbsp;to do this kind of restructuring? Should Mr. Hyde be punished but not
<BR>
&nbsp;Dr. Jekyll? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>An interesting example.  However, if such a restructuring is possible in the 
<BR>
first place, then it is likely that other changes could be made.  Offer Dr. 
<BR>
Jekyll the chance to rid himself of Mr Hyde.  This is of course assuming that 
<BR>
Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde are still in essence the same person, but with 
<BR>
differing moral constraints.  The real problem would be if they are truly 
<BR>
independent and individual personalities.  Of course, given your example I 
<BR>
would guess that the Mr Hyde persona is somewhat underdeveloped (though 
<BR>
perhaps quite colorful) compared to Dr Jekyll since it is the Jekyll persona 
<BR>
that is best for handling the majority of the day's events.  The more time he 
<BR>
spends as Hyde, the greater the chance of discovery, hence Jekyll is likely 
<BR>
the default personality.  Now then, if Jekyll is merely a glib shell used 
<BR>
solely for public appearances, this would not be the case, but also it would 
<BR>
be less likely that there would be a true working personality there.  Also a 
<BR>
question is &quot;how bad is bad?&quot;  Has Hyde killed?  Or does he just take in the 
<BR>
bribes to lose some of Jekyll's paperwork&lt;g&gt;.  The three factors most 
<BR>
important in dealing with such a person would be:
<BR>
1) How separable are the two personalities (are there really two different 
<BR>
people or just very different facets of one)?
<BR>
2) How well developed are the personalities?
<BR>
3) What kinds of crimes are being committed?
