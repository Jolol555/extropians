<EM>&gt; Howzabout THIS for not only pejorative, but irretrievably true?

<EM>&gt; The cruel and cynical actions of the NRA,
</EM><BR>
<P>namely?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; as distinguished from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Madison Avenue bullshit spindoctor-manufactured Hollywood (Prez
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Charleton Heston?  Yagottabekidding!)
</EM><BR>
<P>Why?  You reckon Heston doesn't really know how to shoot, or something?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; image, would lead one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; necessarily believe that the voting majority of their members are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soulless ghouls who have perpetual hard-ons for and wear their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; emotionally overwrought and bleeding hearts on their sleeves for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lifeless and engineered-for-the-express-purpose-of-death-dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hunks of metal,
</EM><BR>
<P>To pick a nit - the *purpose* of most guns is not to kill but to
<BR>
threaten, as in &quot;Let go of that nice lady before I do something
<BR>
permanent.&quot;  The threat, to be effective, requires the *ability* to deal
<BR>
death; but the ability and the purpose are not the same thing.  &quot;The
<BR>
most effective weapon is the one that need never be used.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; but cannot muster a shred of sympathy for dead little girls. 
</EM><BR>
<P>For every dead little girl who makes headlines, there's another (and
<BR>
another and another) who is alive because a gun was available.  You
<BR>
would condemn them, and feel good about it because they were bludgeoned
<BR>
or strangled rather than shot.
<BR>
<P>Forgive me if I don't see what's so damned superior about you because
<BR>
you can't appreciate the value of a reliable defense.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; They DO sociopathically, and quite obviously, care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more for killing machines than they do for their fellow human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; beings, although to call the rest of the race their &quot;fellows&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slurs the rest of humanity by association with pond scum. 
</EM><BR>
<P>(I'm reminded of Huxley's retort to Wilberforce.)
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; It might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; impolite to call sick, twisted, demented and bloodthirsty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (&quot;PLEASE, Lord, lemme meet a mugger today and legally kill 'im!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychopaths what they are, but the truth, by definition, can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NEVER be an insult!
</EM><BR>
<P>When I bought my first gun four years ago, my then housemate (a life NRA
<BR>
member who taught me to shoot) said, &quot;Congratulations. May you never
<BR>
need it.&quot;
<BR>
<P>He goes to the range every Sunday; he is quite fond of his Dirty Harry
<BR>
piece, and has had more than one occasion to show it to a mugger.  (His
<BR>
former place of business, a bookshop, was in a seedy neighborhood.) 
<BR>
They fled at the sight, so he didn't need to fire it.
<BR>
<P>Across this great land, similar encounters happen about a million times
<BR>
a year, by every credible estimate.  (Low end about 0.6 million, high
<BR>
end about three, if memory serves.)  What would you prefer?
<BR>
<P>Okay, I confess, every time I take public transport and have a gun with
<BR>
me, I imagine what I might do if that creep from the Long Island
<BR>
Railroad were to appear.  And sometimes I fantasize about getting the
<BR>
drop on Gianluigi Ferri, who shot eight people in the building where I
<BR>
now work (a year before I started there).  Guess that makes me one sick
<BR>
fuck, eh?
<BR>
