Subject: Re: The Value of Extremists
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Think of the analogy of wearing suits.  A simple story
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about wearing suits at work is that there are a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bozos out there who refuse, and they aren't desirable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; workers.  So everyone else distinguishes themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from these bozos by wearing a suit, even though they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't like it.  If there weren't such bozos, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wouldn't be a need to wear suits, and everyone would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be happier.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sort of.  If you have a smoothly running profitable operation, then that is a
<BR>
good strategy.  But if your organization is hitting bottom, and you need to
<BR>
bring in some fresh blood to invigorate it, then yes, hire the long haired
<BR>
radical.  The long haired is going to rethink things, come up with new ideas,
<BR>
instead of just going along with the way things have always been done.
<BR>
<P>There is a place for all different kinds of people in society.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Similarly with ideas, the reason most people I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resist exploring extreme ideas is that the only people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they've seen exploring them are these bozos they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not want others to confuse them with.  So they back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off, even though they find the ideas intrinsically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting.  Just yesterday I talked with a very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; smart colleague who did not want to hear about nanotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because once years ago some idiot at a party cornered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him and blathered on and on about it with very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poorly conceived ideas and arguments.
</EM><BR>
<P>And I can't really respect anybody who automatically rejects ideas because they
<BR>
seem far out.  That is why we need to have a libertarian political system that
<BR>
will allow people like me, to co-exist with people like that.
