<P><EM>&gt; Science doesn't explore laughter much. Perhaps there is an irony to that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere...

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Actually, that isn't entirely true. While it is true that concentrated
<BR>
psychological research into the area of laughter and humor didn't really
<BR>
start until the 1960's, there has been quite a bit of study conducted
<BR>
since then. And of course, this doesn't even count the historical and
<BR>
sociological analysis of humor.
<BR>
<P>A search on Google.com for the keywords: 'psychological studies of
<BR>
laughter and humor' produced about 1400 results. Obviously, each one is
<BR>
not a peer-reviewed journal article, but the majority of them looked
<BR>
like they would have something useful to contribute. Although, I will
<BR>
grant you that humor, laughter and their effects both psychological and
<BR>
physiologically haven't been studied nearly as much as anger or anxiety.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's often a &quot;surprise mechanism&quot; that triggers laughter, not only cruelty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and oddities.
</EM><BR>
<P>One of the things that has received a lot of recent attention has been
<BR>
the primary factors responsible for eliciting a laugh, or feeling of
<BR>
mirth, when perceiving a specific situation. And the &quot;surprise
<BR>
mechanism&quot; you mention above seems to be one of the major contributors.
<BR>
People have a certain expectation, or schema, with which they use to
<BR>
heuristically predict how a situation should go (&quot;garden pathing&quot; is a
<BR>
very simplistic example of this). When this schema is violated in a
<BR>
novel way, this can lead to laughter and our perception that something
<BR>
humorous just happened.
