<EM>&gt; &gt; Neal, although i would hate to think you could get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in trouble, and I would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; never want to offend anyone young... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *grin* I'm not offended.
</EM><BR>
<P>Me neither.

<EM>&gt;  well, first off, I'm fourteen. And I can discuss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sex with my parents, but I choose not to because
</EM><BR>
they
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have a curious reaction to things labelled 'hot
</EM><BR>
sex',
<BR>
<P>Me, I'm fifteen. And my parents aren't exactly what
<BR>
qualifies as &quot;open-minded&quot; :)

<EM>&gt; My mom *is* an atheist, and my dad's just fine with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; uploading and cryonic suspension...along with most 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the ideas expressed. Sometimes he even scans 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; through the list.
</EM><BR>
<P>~sigh~ *My* mom is... er... what could be politely
<BR>
referred to as a 'semi-fanatic' when it comes to
<BR>
religion. And that's pretty much the general attitude
<BR>
in this neck of the woods... There's a smattering of
<BR>
atheists, but it's quite the rarity around here. Just
<BR>
yesterday I got into a 'discussion' (which turned into
<BR>
a 'her screaming at me and running off' thing,
<BR>
unfortunately) with a girl at my school, when she
<BR>
started talking about how &quot;God's going to end the
<BR>
world&quot;, and &quot;Heaven&quot; and stuff like that. I was quite
<BR>
polite, kept the &quot;shocking ideas&quot; as low-key as I
<BR>
could, but she just couldn't handle the concepts and
<BR>
resorted to the usual righteous shouting of such
<BR>
highly intelligent arguments as &quot;You're just wrong!!&quot;
<BR>
(to which I responded &quot;How do you know?&quot;, triggering
<BR>
the next), &quot;The Bible says so!&quot; (&quot;Do you believe
<BR>
everything you read?&quot;), &quot;Of course not!&quot; (&quot;Then why do
<BR>
you accept everything you read in the Bible without
<BR>
the slightest doubts?&quot;), and so on. And as for my dad?
<BR>
He can't even stand to watch those 'future technology'
<BR>
shows on Discovery and stuff (like those ones they
<BR>
showed back around the end of December 99). He's one
<BR>
of those people who can't stand to not be in *control*
<BR>
of everything, and he does *not* like all this
<BR>
technology he can't control!! :)

<P>Better height-wise than me, I'm a year older than you

and five feet myself! :)

<EM>&gt; But as Eliezer/Neal/Ziana observe, it isn't our

<EM>&gt; subscribers who may not be especially happy with the

<P><EM>&gt; topics we so freely throw around.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, very well said. I want to comment on that, but I
<BR>
can't think of anything to say! Ah, well. :) --insert

thoughtful response I can't seem to think of at the

moment here-- :)

<EM>&gt; That's cool, i get a better picture now, and it's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good knowing that you will be able to talk about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this stuff with them - instead of getting &quot;in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trouble&quot; for having way out ideas.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're lucky, Neal :) Unfortunately, not everyone is
<BR>
so open-minded....

<P>Oh, if only! Everyone else in my family is highly
<BR>
religious; only recently have I made the only slight
<BR>
inroad of progress so far, talking my mom out of
<BR>
making me attend church (they're Catholics) every
<BR>
Sunday morning (although I'm supposed to spend that
<BR>
hour at home reading religious literature).
<BR>
Eventually....
