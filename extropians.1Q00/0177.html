<EM>&gt; How about just using the word &quot;fanaticism&quot;.... &quot;Environmental fanaticism&quot;, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Religious fanaticism&quot;, &quot;Political fanaticism&quot; that way the point is clear 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that this is not all inclusive to any and all religious or environmental 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activists but those who are know who your talking about by reading the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agendas.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't agree that only fanatics will be opposed to extropian and
<BR>
transhuman ideas.  Sincere, reasonable people may raise various sorts
<BR>
of objections that we would not agree with, but that does not make
<BR>
them fanatics.
<BR>
<P>I am not comfortable with creating what seems to amount to an &quot;enemies
<BR>
list&quot;.  (If this is not a fair description, I'd like to hear how
<BR>
it differs.)  Even more, I don't think we should demonize those who
<BR>
disagree with us by characterizing them as fanatics.
<BR>
<P>I would like to see us move beyond the politics of opposition, of point
<BR>
and counterpoint, thesis and antithesis, of winners and losers.  I agree
<BR>
with the earlier message that this was the framework of twentieth century
<BR>
revolutionary movements.
<BR>
<P>We don't need a Great Debate in which we seek to defeat our opponents (and
<BR>
must start by identifying them in order to plot our campaign).  This is
<BR>
the language of warfare, memetic warfare in this case but war nonetheless.
<BR>
<P>I see the 21st century memetic landscape as being far more diverse and
<BR>
complex than the mechanistic, rigid view of the past.  We don't need to
<BR>
capture and occupy territory.  Rather, we should expand the framework of
<BR>
ideas, seeking peaceful coexistence with those who have differing views.
<BR>
Our goal should not be to convert others to our memetic culture, but to
<BR>
embrace their differences.  In diversity there is strength.
