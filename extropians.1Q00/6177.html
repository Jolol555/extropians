<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Technotranscendence&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:neptune@mars.superlink.net?Subject=Re:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000330033253.89077.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">neptune@mars.superlink.net</A>&gt;

<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Come on.  Get real.  It is illegal to murder people, regardless of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they are gay or how much &quot;mind blowing anal sex&quot; they enjoy.  And the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of the matter is that those laws are enforced.  Sure there was a time 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if you were black in America you had no rights which any white man was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to honor.  Those days are passed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Depends on where you are, really.  Three people were recently murdered in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NYC by the police there.  In at least one of the cases -- the Diallo one --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the police were acquitted.
</EM><BR>
<P>No it doesn't depend where (in the US) you are.  It is the law of the land 
<BR>
that all humans are entitled to the protection (and punishment) of the law.  
<BR>
Now the law is not perfectly applied but that is only because humans are 
<BR>
imperfect and, as of yet, we haven't found anyone else to apply our laws for 
<BR>
us.  Just because those cops were acquitted doesn't mean that they got away 
<BR>
with murder.  They were arrested, charged and tried.  A jury of 12 people 
<BR>
decided that it was justifiable homicide.  I'm not saying they were right, 
<BR>
no one (other than the cops themselves) will ever know.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I never said transparency will necessarily bring about an end to all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;illegal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; behavior.  What it will do is *guarantee* that the perpetrator is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; identified, caught and convicted.  That's about all any social policy 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; hope to do.  To cure people of criminal tendencies you need to look to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; neuroscientists, and maybe the philosophers.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm not asking for ubiquitous surveillance to guarantee social perfection.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My point is that it would only accenuate current imperfections.  I think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;this is what some of Zero's other critics are getting at too.  The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thing ubiquitous surveillanca will guarantee, I believe, is, at least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;temporarily ubiquitous surveillance.  The rest depends on what people do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with it is what is at issue here.  But this is true of any social policy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If one advocates, e.g., capital punishment, one could argue that murderers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should die for their crime.  I would agree, but, as a practical matter, if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we wrongfully capitally punish (kill) an innocent, how do undo that?  We 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;disconnect things to examine them in our head, but when the tire meets the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;road, we have to look at what will most likely happen.  Human history is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;awash in blood -- mostly spilled by people who meant well and adopted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seemingly rational policies without examining what these policies might do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the real world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I'm waxing rhetorical here.:/
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, we could give examples and allegories from history from now till the 
<BR>
singularity.  But I think its pretty much a given that when people are being 
<BR>
watched by other people (and they know they are being watched) they tend to 
<BR>
behave themselves much better than when they are alone, in the corner, in 
<BR>
the dark.  So, rather than accentuate current imperfections, I think its 
<BR>
pretty clear that transparency will instead *diminish* current 
<BR>
imperfections.  Until we humans figure out how to be perfect, I think that's 
<BR>
the best we can do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Let me give a more realistic example.  Drug use in the US and many 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is illegal.  To a large extent, drug use is also unpopular.  With 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance, imagine how many pot smokers will be jailed, perhaps for long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terms.
</EM><BR>
<P>This *might* be a problem, but its not a problem with *transparency*.  If 
<BR>
anything its a problem with drug legislation and enforcement.  You could 
<BR>
keep pot smokers out of jail by only hiring deaf, blind and dumb cops with 
<BR>
no sense of smell too.  But I think there are probably better ways to solve 
<BR>
that &quot;problem.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(This is a good example because with D.A.R.E. programs in the US,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;there already are people turning in their relatives, friends, teachers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the police.  D.A.R.E. programs basically teach school aged kids that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cops are fine people and that if anyone is using drugs the police should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;told.  This is one step closer to ubiquitous surveillance in a basically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;democratic society.)  Surely, no one here thinks this a fine use ubiquitous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance, but it would be a likely use if we had it now.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah I guess there's a point there somewhere, but you have to keep in mind 
<BR>
the transparency I'm talking about is two-way.  If it were just one-way 
<BR>
surveillance of the populace I would not be advocating it so vociferously.
