<P><EM>&gt;It's curious, though, that you complain about overly demanding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;strangers as well.  Nothing is more honest than selfishness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Those are by far the easiest people to deal with (usually by just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ignoring them) and cause the fewest problems.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree completely with this. Most requests go immediately to
<BR>
my trash. I don't think about it much (except for the money and time costs).
<BR>
It's easy to sort out what these people want.
<BR>
<P>[One technical issue for me, is that I'm locked into my email
<BR>
system (Eudora+Mac+modem+PPP connection) because it saves me typing
<BR>
keystrokes. Therefore, even those requests where I don't answer
<BR>
and which I delete, still costs me money (time+Deutsche Telekom
<BR>
costs).]
<BR>
<P>Where I find I fail in my knowledge of what to do are those people
<BR>
who aren't clear or honest or know what they want. Yes, that's
<BR>
true in the Real World too.
<BR>
<P>It's the combination of the two that pushed me to my saturation
<BR>
point, to do my &quot;virtual suicide&quot; (as one of the list members
<BR>
called it.. it fits).
<BR>
<P>Amara
<BR>
<P>P.S. I suppose that I felt that my Web site was large extension of
<BR>
myself, like a child, perhaps, so then my attachment brought
<BR>
about complicated psychological factors. I'd rather my life be
<BR>
simpler rather than more complicated. Maybe that's a deeper
<BR>
reason why I had to clean it out for a while and give it a rest.
