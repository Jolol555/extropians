<EM>&gt; Enlightenment&quot; is vigorously being pursued on a daily basis.

<P>I'm very sorry I have to rush, Zero. But if we are earnestly searching for
<BR>
answerable questions and unquestionable answers, are we not already ON
<BR>
the Path?  Being a practicing SOTO Zen Buddhist, I have the bias that we
<BR>
are all already Enlightened but are abysmally ignorant of that fact because
<BR>
we are so frantically searching for Enlightenment. Grasping, clawing, nibbling,
<BR>
digging, tripping, talking to ourselves, agitated by our wild-eyed scanning
<BR>
of the heavens and all the depths that are less than meet the eye.
<BR>
<P>And yes, let me be blunt where you were diplomatic -- WASTE the icons
<BR>
and idols in Extropia.  And demolish everything that stands between us
<BR>
and insight -- THAT is the Path.  You don't need any special Rinzi koans
<BR>
-- just QUESTION EVERYTHING.
