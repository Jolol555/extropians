<P>
At least until a darkhorse technology (nanotech?) springs into existence 
<BR>
(from a market pov) my guess is that the future is going to be powered by two 
<BR>
success stories.  One is natural gas (which everyone outside the USA calls met
<BR>
hane); the other is windmills. Hopefully power storage media such as fuel 
<BR>
cells will extend the range and applicability of methane and wind, 
<BR>
derived-energy.  Even depending on methane alone, the amount of economically 
<BR>
viable natural gas is stupendous; and the non-conventional sources are 
<BR>
staggering. 
<BR>
<P>The other source, wind energy, has the possibility of supplying all USA needs 
<BR>
-economic viability set-asside, momentarilly.  Why  are photovoltaics and 
<BR>
fusion always 10-20 years away?  My guess is that nobody has seriously 
<BR>
challenged the physicists, and chemists who have touted these 'alternatives'.
