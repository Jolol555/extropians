<EM> &gt; I do, however, think that the few people who actually do research on
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; suspension techniques spend all their time concentrating on how brains get
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; damaged in the present, which leaves them with very little time to think
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; about how they could be repaired in the future.  This is entirely
</EM><BR>
<P>Let me try again. I have a couple of motley colored designer gummi
<BR>
bears, which I drop into a big beaker of cold water. Nothing dramatic
<BR>
happens. I now increase the temperature of the water. The little
<BR>
critters begin to swell and there is some dye diffustion, but they
<BR>
would still retain their relative geometric relations, and essentially
<BR>
return to the original shape when dried. I could also compute the
<BR>
original shape numerically, since this is a smooth transformation. The
<BR>
exact procedure doesn't matter.
<BR>
<P>Now I bring the solution to the boil. Soon after I have a homogenous
<BR>
gelatine solution, all traces about the gummibear's original shape and
<BR>
coloration erased. Now time stops in the beaker. Freeeeeze. 256 years
<BR>
later, time resumes, and the system is given advanced (but not
<BR>
Omega-grade) future intelligences for analysis and reconstruction.
<BR>
<P>Which information is still present about the shape and distribution of
<BR>
coloration of the original gummi bears? Would the type of technique
<BR>
used for reconstruction influence the result a lot?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; appropriate, since the present is what we need to concentrate on now.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; However, it seems to result in an undue level of pessimism over the ultimate
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; prospects for repair.  To be honest, Charles Platt's reply reminds me a lot
</EM><BR>
<P>This is not about pessimism at all. You aren't an engineer, are you?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; of the things the cryobiologists like to say about cryonicists - totally
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; true from his perspective, but essentially irrelevant from mine.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Nevertheless, I'm willing to take another shot at this if you are.  My basic
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; points are simply:
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 1) The fact that a structure looks completely scrambled tells you almost
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; nothing about how hard it would be to figure out what it originally looked
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; like.  Look at image processing, or cryptography, or archaeology for that
</EM><BR>
<P>If I use a true random generator (or a pseudorandom generator unknown
<BR>
to you) to scramble the picture, information is lost. Period. If
<BR>
enough noise is present, nothing can be said about the original
<BR>
picture. If the noise is considerable, the information content is
<BR>
degraded. 
<BR>
<P>If you think that dissipative physical processes are driven by
<BR>
pseudorandom number generators, you're in for a nasty surprise.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; matter.  That doesn't mean that success is guaranteed in every case, but
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; experience shows that it is always possible to deduce a lot more than a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; non-specialist would expect.  Unfortunately, computational brain
</EM><BR>
<P>You are surely aware that the position you question are held by the
<BR>
only specialists in the matter there are? There are no better ones
<BR>
yet. What are your credentials in the matter? Programmer, aren't you?
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; reconstruction is a specialty that doesn't exist yet, so we can't just ask
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; an expert about it.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
So we assume a best case as default. No further research needs to be
<BR>
done, because the information Is Still In There, Somehow.
<BR>
<P>Sorry, I don't buy it.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; 2) Every repair scheme I've ever heard of relies on massive computing power
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
<EM> &gt; and very limited intelligence.  This is totally unrealistic.  We should
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
This sentence makes no sense. It is also pure fabrication.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; expect both the computing power and the intelligence of possible repair
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; technologies to increase steadily over time, and it is not at all clear what
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the ultimate limits might be.  IOW, we should ask whether a team of
</EM><BR>
<P>The ultimate limits are very clear indeed: the information content
<BR>
present in the specimen. We're not interested in somebody a bit like a 
<BR>
patient, so plausible substituions do not count.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; scientists with unlimited time and funding could reconstruct the state of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cell X, not whether we can see how to write a program to do the job.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 3) Many people seem to think that there is no point in signing up for
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; suspension, because they will never actually get frozen.  This is simply
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see many problems in getting frozen, a number of precautions
<BR>
assuming. I see a lot more problems in staying frozen, mostly because
<BR>
of above attitudes. &quot;What, me worry?&quot; hits too close to the mark for
<BR>
comfort.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; nonsense.  Most cryonicists do in fact end up being suspended when they die.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; So, people shouldn't use this as an excuse for dismissing cryonics - if you
</EM><BR>
<P>Nobody is dismissing anything. You once again missed what this is all about.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; don't think it will work, argue that it won't work.  (Mind you, the system
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; could be a lot better than it is if the money was there, but that is a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; different issue).
