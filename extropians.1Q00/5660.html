<EM>&gt; (he

<EM>&gt; called it just &quot;syndicalism&quot;) not being &quot;anarchy&quot; at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all, because there is a government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I took it upon myself to look us &quot;syndicalism&quot; in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dictionary.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; syn·di·cal·ism (s n d - k - l z m) 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; n. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; A radical political movement that advocates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bringing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and government under the control of federations of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unions by the use of direct action, such as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strikes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and sabotage.
</EM><BR>
<P>Obviously not a dictionary written by anarchists.  A
<BR>
more useful definition comes from
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secI3.html#seci31">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/secI3.html#seci31</A>
<BR>
I.3.1 What is a &quot;syndicate&quot;? - &quot;As we will use the
<BR>
term, a &quot;syndicate&quot; (often called a &quot;producer
<BR>
cooperative,&quot; or &quot;cooperative&quot; for short, sometimes
<BR>
&quot;collective&quot; or &quot;association of producers&quot; or &quot;guild
<BR>
factory&quot; or &quot;guild workplace&quot;) is a democratically
<BR>
self-managed productive enterprise whose productive
<BR>
assets are either owned by its workers or by society
<BR>
as a whole. 
<BR>
&quot;It is important to note that individuals who do not
<BR>
wish to join syndicates will be able to work for
<BR>
themselves. There is no &quot;forced collectivization&quot;
<BR>
under any form of libertarian socialism, because
<BR>
coercing people is incompatible with the basic
<BR>
principles of anarchism. Those who wish to be
<BR>
self-employed will have free access to the productive
<BR>
assets they need, provided that they neither attempt
<BR>
to monopolize more of those assets than they and their
<BR>
families can use by themselves nor attempt to employ
<BR>
others for wages (see section I.3.7).&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It appears the imaginary person has a point. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government by federation of labor unions is still a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government. (Sounds like a branch of communism to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Your confusion is of a typical variety.  Reading what
<BR>
actual anarchists have to say about anarchism would be
<BR>
helpful.  <A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/">http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/1931/</A>
<BR>
is an excellent place to start.  The site in question
<BR>
also details the problems that anarchists have with
<BR>
State Socialism (Communism), among other things.
<BR>
<P>Later,
<BR>
