<EM>&gt; Ok thanks for sharing adolescent fantasies.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, what exactly is wrong with a man wanting there to be lots of beautiful
<BR>
women in the world?  (Or vice versa, of course.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (Now if you can also program them to tell you are the best lover in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; universe whether or not that's true....)
</EM><BR>
<P>How about if we combine the body mods with a little hedonic engineering, so
<BR>
that sex can actually be as good as we all wish it was?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ever hear of the Stepford Wives?
</EM><BR>
<P>Fictional treatments of this subject always assume that 1) the women are
<BR>
coerced, 2) the men are either scum or nitwits, 3) mental mods are only
<BR>
superficial, so the 'real you' is still in there somewhere, and 4) boring
<BR>
mediocrity is somehow better than ant fantasy.  None of these assumptions
<BR>
are likely to hold in the real world.  I'm not sure what the result will be,
<BR>
but I expect it will be far more complex (and interesting) than anything
<BR>
portrayed in fiction.
<BR>
<P>several people wrote (paraphrasing):
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Body mods!  Eeek!  Oh, no, everyone will become a soulless clone of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; latest trendy body style!  Evil corporations will take over our bodies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doom us to an eternity of bland sameness.  The sky is falling!  The sky is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; falling!
</EM><BR>
<P>Get a grip, guys.  This attitude is itself an example of mindless conformity
<BR>
to decades of bad science fiction and intellectual elitism.  The only
<BR>
segment of society where the herd instinct is that strong is teenagers, and
<BR>
that is obviously a temporary phase.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure most people will want to be good looking, but that does not imply
<BR>
they will all look the same.  It is already possible to have yourself
<BR>
altered to look like an attractive celebrity, but virtually no one does.
<BR>
What most people want is to look like themselves, only better.
<BR>
<P>So, the middle class gets in shape while the upper class goes looking for
<BR>
ways to stand out.  Since exceptional beauty requires that you look
<BR>
different than everyone around you, that means a whole new branch of art
<BR>
will arise to fill the demand for unusual and esthetically pleasing bodies.
<BR>
And lets not forget that standards of beauty vary a great deal from person
<BR>
to person, let alone between different cultures.
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, we have lots of subcultures that will probably diverge from human
<BR>
norms.  I predict that many Furries will actually become their favorite
<BR>
anthropomorphic form, many sci-fi and fantasy fans will want to look like
<BR>
humanoid aliens or fantasy races, and many fetishists will lavish great
<BR>
attention on whatever it is that they like.  Throw in a scattering of purely
<BR>
functional enhancements that happen to have cosmetic side effects and you've
<BR>
got a recipe for an explosion of diversity in human appearance.
