Dear Renee,
<BR>
<P>I was browsing the backlog of letters and came across yours. Regarding your
<BR>
request for book recommendations, two come immediately to mind:
<BR>
<P>The Future and its Enemies, by Virginia Postrel, editor of Reason magazine.
<BR>
She divides the political world in an interesting way-stasists vs.
<BR>
dynamists. The stasists come in two varieties, reactionaries and
<BR>
technocrats. These might seem to be strange ideological bedfellows, but what
<BR>
they have in common is fear of freedom. As I was reading her book I couldn't
<BR>
help thinking of Stuart Kauffman's books (so I have three authors, not two):
<BR>
The Origins of Order: Self Organization and Selection in Evolution (rather
<BR>
technical) and At Home in the Universe: the Search for the Laws of
<BR>
Self-Organization and Complexity. Kauffman analyzes systems. He finds
<BR>
'creativity' maximized at 'the edge of chaos': a balance point in systems
<BR>
between stasis and chaos. I would love to read an in-depth dialogue between
<BR>
the politically focussed Postrel and Kauffman, the mathematician and systems
<BR>
analyst. I think something productive could come out of that.
<BR>
<P>The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes-and its
<BR>
Implications, by David Deutsch (a major contributor to the development of
<BR>
the theory of quantum computation). This book is the ultimate 'adventure of
<BR>
the mind'. Deutsch believes strongly that the point and purpose of science
<BR>
is not prediction, but understanding, and he develops a strong case against
<BR>
instrumentalism, the view that we should be satisfied with the world as
<BR>
black box, as long as we can correlate inputs and outputs correctly. Chapter
<BR>
two, entitled 'Shadows' develops a compelling case for the reality of
<BR>
parallel universes without mentioning quantum mechanics in the argument. He
<BR>
identifies four main strands of explanation whose interwoven fabric provides
<BR>
a basis for understanding the world: quantum physics, epistemology, the
<BR>
theory of computation, and the theory of evolution. I read this book
<BR>
straight through twice when I came across it last year and I'm rereading it
<BR>
a third time to try to internalize what he has to say.
<BR>
<P>Hope you try them and enjoy them,
<BR>
Don Klemencic

Subject:	Fresh Meat
<BR>
<P><P>I recently signed into the extropian mailing list a few weeks ago and have
<BR>
been sifting through your abundant correspondances. I found it amusing how
<BR>
some people commented on the &quot;anger&quot; or &quot;aggressiveness&quot; of this list.
<BR>
<P>I say, &quot;AAAHHHH they're alive!!!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Be angry, be passionate, be compassionate also over another viewpoint. After
<BR>
all people that touch your life will either reaffirm your convictions or
<BR>
change them. The path to intellectual &quot;truth&quot; (which I have purposely
<BR>
encased in quotations, is to remark that what &quot;truth&quot; is is exclusively the
<BR>
given individual's perception of what it is) means you may build on a
<BR>
hypothesis then par hassard, be forced to tear that investment down in order
<BR>
to construct a more solid one. Ah there is such expenses involved....but the
<BR>
next will be even better, stronger in your life's goal.
<BR>
<P>Finding intellectual &quot;truth&quot; may also be attributed to making an honest try
<BR>
at being objective in cultivating ones interests.
<BR>
<P>How to be objective? One example is living in foreign countries (I spent 3
<BR>
years in Paris) and have regular daily contact with the native people. One
<BR>
realizes by discovery that while learning about this foriegn country, you
<BR>
are learning even more about your own (through cultural comparison and the
<BR>
natives' perception of your home country).
<BR>
<P>With that being said, I would like to comment on this education issue that
<BR>
seems to be maintaining a lively dialogue. To address the point of religion
<BR>
in schools- I read the Kansas resolution and to say the least, was chilled
<BR>
to the bone--I feel as many others, that it has no place there as per
<BR>
intent.
<BR>
<P>Church is free and abundant in the USA with 40% of the nation paying their
<BR>
respects at least once a week. And as far as their children getting
<BR>
religious education-- don't they have Sunday SCHOOL programs at church?
<BR>
<P>If religious folks want religion in school, to be fair all religions should
<BR>
be taught with equal attention to the subject, theology, to give all its
<BR>
honest due and as a subject to be studied not narrow-mindedly indoctrinated.
<BR>
(perhaps the Christian Coalition would not have this *quite* in mind.
<BR>
<P>I wouldn't actually mind it being taught in a manner taken for the ancient
<BR>
religions and religious dieties; (i.e. the Egyptian/Greek/Roman Gods) as
<BR>
myth with historical importance.
<BR>
<P>I would also like to comment on the &quot;reducing sex drive&quot; issue. Before that
<BR>
I should mention that I am a feminist. Wait don't sigh...I'm not one of
<BR>
those WASPy girls that are as much in touch with reality as our fairy tale
<BR>
maiden with the long red hair in a certain tower. I'm a
<BR>
Camille-Paglia-let's- be- real-
<BR>
and-face-it-that-with-freedom-comes-responsibility-wake-up-upper-middle-clas
<BR>
s-girls-I-grew-up-with- that-
<BR>
if-you-want-to-think-that-boys-will-behave-nice-like-girls-then-perhaps-you-
<BR>
need-a-chaperone-on-your-outings-my-lassies-because-testostrone-is-dangerous
<BR>
-!!!!-!!! kind of feminist.
<BR>
<P>It may be dangerous, volitale, but it's also the woman's &quot;ace in the hole&quot;.
<BR>
Men do &quot;strange things&quot; that go not only against their intellectual but
<BR>
biological nature as well. They assist in raising children, work extremely
<BR>
hard on their career (often something they may not enjoy) and live peaceably
<BR>
in a society.
<BR>
<P>If they don't their fundamental urges are denied. ANyone ever seen the movie
<BR>
&quot;Trading Places&quot;, where Eddie Murphy says, &quot;I lost my job, my wife won't
<BR>
make love to me no more&quot;? hmmmmm.
<BR>
<P>The male sex drive indirectly does alot of good for women (besides the
<BR>
obvious direct part). If we diminished it we would loose the female power to
<BR>
bend men to the will of women. (which fundamentally is bearing and nuturing
<BR>
children to adulthood). Occasional anti-societal manifestations, I believe,
<BR>
are a small price to pay for the overall benefits. I say, hail
<BR>
testosterone!! Keep it going until the last man has transfered his mind into
<BR>
his nano-immortality machine....
<BR>
<P>Once we have reached voluntary immortality. Sex will no longer be an issue
<BR>
anyway, right? Could loosing the sexual interest mean to loose the interest
<BR>
to think and be our clever pre-transhuman selves? I think not. We could
<BR>
loose the interest in sex simply through lack of hormones, but thinking is
<BR>
so fundamentally tied to the conscious mind that it may be happy to plod
<BR>
along ad infinitum learning its fancies. Those who loose interest could
<BR>
always &quot;unplug&quot; themselves.
<BR>
<P>Before everyone nods off, I want to mention some of my favorite authors and
<BR>
would like to hear of any recommendations. Matt Ridley, Richard Dawkins (I
<BR>
noticed others share my interest there). ALso Carl Djerassi for his
<BR>
science-in-fiction novels--lots of fun. For real feminism (not
<BR>
-nazism)Camille Paglia. Political freshness??, Aldous Huxley (no not just
<BR>
&quot;Brave New World&quot;).
<BR>
<P>In further regard to Huxley's novels: One can learn alot more from ficitious
<BR>
dinner parties in the 1920s then through political debates on television
<BR>
today. It was a time of hope, worry, and major political turmoil. The mixing
<BR>
of many intellectual minds and their repsective  political parties. A period
<BR>
on the brink of National Socialism that fell on the Industrialized world. As
<BR>
we move into the new century/millineum this grey cloud still looms over
<BR>
us.......
<BR>
<P>Best Regards,
<BR>
