<P>This is an &quot;endotheliocyte&quot;.  There is already a fairly large paper
<BR>
on it done by Robert Freitas in conjunction with his development of
<BR>
some of the concepts outlined in Nanomedicine.  NM documents about
<BR>
a dozen different kinds of nanobots to be used in medical applications.
<BR>
So far extensive operating principles, rough architectures, etc. have
<BR>
only been worked out for 2, the respirocyte for O2/CO2 storage and
<BR>
the endotheliocyte for artery cleanup.  There is a lot of work to
<BR>
be done in this area and volunteers are welcome.

<P>This too is covered in Nanomedicine.  The capabilities of diamondoid
<BR>
based nanobots are so great however, you don't have to drag in viruses.
<BR>
They could do chemotherapy, but the simplest thing is to simply induce
<BR>
apoptosis in tumor cells causing them to die away cleanly.  Alternately
<BR>
you could replace the genome entirely using &quot;nuclear abortion&quot;.  Interestingly
<BR>
one of the things nanobots would have a hard time with is finding
<BR>
specific mutations in your DNA and correcting them.  They would have
<BR>
to do it with nano-endoscopes with DNA reading and repair &quot;tips&quot; and
<BR>
that seems a bit &quot;iffy&quot; to me.  Of course if we ever get virus based
<BR>
biotech so it accomplishes a little cut, paste and splice manipulation
<BR>
in specific locations it could presumably be managed by the nanobots
<BR>
as well.  But I assure you that this is going to be a real &quot;feat&quot;
<BR>
of genetic engineering.  (On the other hand simply adding back in
<BR>
functional copies of mutated p53 genes is already being done.)
