<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; But did MAD work?  Angelo Codevilla, in _Informing Statecraft_ (see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/IP1_Know.html">http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/IP1_Know.html</A>), tells of how a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; evidence came up in the 1980s and early 1990s that the Soviets, in fact,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; were preparing for an all out nuclear war.  Whether this was paranoia on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; their part or the planning stages of a first strike remains to be seen.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; That the Soviets also continued a military buildup -- in both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conventional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and nuclear forces -- seems to support the latter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Whether it worked or not is irrelevant. The Soviets are the example of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; individual without honor or integrity. My position is that it was and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unreasonable and unconstitutional for our nation's leaders to place US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; in the same position as a bunch of untrustworthy thugs and tyrants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You do not structure your society expaecting everyone to behave as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; poorly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as the worst member, because given such expectation, many surely will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; behave in such a manner. Expecting people to behave honorably as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; default
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; raises the standard of performance, and you only treat those who do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do so (criminals) by a different standard once they have done so.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't completely disagree with Michael here.  My comments were only anent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Mutually Assured Destruction.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would say one thing though regarding &quot;structuring&quot; society, one would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to beware of uncouraging certain forms of behavior by allowing hgih pay offs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for bad behaviors.  For instance, and to stick with international relations,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you make treaties in good faith with, say, the Soviets (or the Nazis),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then you have to expect them to break the treaty.  It's almost pointless to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make treaties with such states.  The high pay off for them is it legitimizes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their form of government and it usually puts those who would hold to such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treaties at a disadvantage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You argument that this is insufficient in a world where an individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will have the capability to destroy the earth does give one pause as to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whether this is still rational to expect, since it only would take one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; bad apple.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Not exactly my argument.  Who is Michael arguing with here?  My only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contribution to this thread was the part on MAD.  I'm mad about MAD.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For the record, I do not and have not ever argued that any or all the Cold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; War powers had the ability to destroy the Earth.  The Earth and life are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much tougher than that.  Of course, life would have been miserable for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little while after a total nuclear war, but the Earth would not vaporize a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; la &quot;Beneath the Planet of the Apes.&quot;:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would rather live in a world where the bad apples are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; weeded out early, a la, David Brin's concept of declaring Propationary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Personalities (see his Uplift War trilogy), than to have a wholesale
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; abrogation of the rights of the individual, and I think that since we do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have a bit of a 'ramping up' period ahead of us, that this be tried
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would rather move to space and watch from a safe distance to see if Brin's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society comes about and works according to the lines he (or Michael) has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (have) laid down.:)  The Uplift Trilogy is not my manual for political
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science.  (Not that i'm about to offer one either.:)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An honorable person needs no external consequences. A society that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only on external consequences has acknowledged that men are nothing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; savages and have no honor or rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Honor does not pay the rent.  Anyway, if one looks at honor as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desire to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; be moral, and if one doesn't accept the kind of Platonic morality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; hints at, but the more worldly, Aristotelean or Objectivist one I tend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; toward, then the goal of morality is successful life -- not to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; honorable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in spite of what will be, but to be honorable in hopes of what will be.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Ah, but it does keep the landlord and tenant both on their best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; behavior,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; without the extortion of overwhelming force, or the might of public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; humiliation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree, but it not the sort of Platonic honor Michael hints at.  I try to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep my word because that's the kind of person I want to be.  But I suspect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many (not most, but enough) people keep their word because they either fear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the penalties of getting caught or they are paranoid.  It would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting to see how much real honor a society needs to keep going versus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;The Fable of the Bees&quot; type compromises.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Also, if honor always had bad consequences, any person following it or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society based on it, would soon cease to exist.  My point being:  Michael
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has yet to answer me on this one.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>It was me extolling honor, not the reverse...
