<P><EM>&gt; United for a Fair Economy has an interesting report out...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.stw.org/assets/DivDec.pdf">http://www.stw.org/assets/DivDec.pdf</A>
</EM><BR>
<P>It was interesting seeing the growth in &quot;zero or negative net 
<BR>
worth&quot;, from 10% to 20% of the population.  You'd think we ought to 
<BR>
start setting property requirements for voting.  Next thing, it'll 
<BR>
be time for bread and circuses.
<BR>
<P>In _The Virginian_, a character asks what a foreman is, and is told 
<BR>
that it must be a sort of high-class house servant.  From the owners'
<BR>
point of view, a CEO isn't much more than a sort of high-class
<BR>
foreman.  So why the big bucks?  Is it because ownership in public
<BR>
entities is so scattered that CEOs can wholeheartedly pursue their
<BR>
own interests?
<BR>
<P>I couldn't seem to reach the FoRK archives tonight, so I can't check 
<BR>
what results I came up with in our estate tax thread.  Anyway, this 
<BR>
report claims that only about 2% of households wind up subject to 
<BR>
estate taxes, and that the actual median household net worth is $50K.
<BR>
It seems that having estate taxes cut in at $2 million (for a married
<BR>
couple) wouldn't be a widespread burden.
<BR>
<P>I can't say I agree with many of the conclusions; most of the 
<BR>
figures quoted seem to arise because:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- wealth and income have long-tailed distributions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- inflation and interest drive everything to larger
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;figures and greater disparities (how would things
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;look on a log scale?)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- interest rate changes drastically shift &quot;wealth&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;between asset holders and wage earners.  A look at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cash flow/equivalent income might show a steadier
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pattern.
<BR>
<P>However, I do have to agree that it is silly to tax capital gains 
<BR>
differently from wages.  (Perhaps it is an attempt to discourage 
<BR>
rent-seeking?)  In the middle ages, financiers proved smart enough
<BR>
to outwit the church's prohibition on usury by disguising interest 
<BR>
income as exchange profit; today financiers are probably smart
<BR>
enough to outwit the tax system by disguising income as gains.
