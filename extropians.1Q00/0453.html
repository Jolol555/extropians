<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;The largest study ever done on domestic violence, involving detailed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;interviews with 23,000 victims revealed that in 70% of the cases, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;woman instigated the violence.  Typically she would keep escalating
</EM><BR>
until
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;the man responded, at which point the police would be called and the man
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;arrested - about 98% of the time back then (this was three or four years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;ago, as i recall).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Have a cite for this study?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
[...]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Bottom line:  it's not politically correct (read economically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feasible, when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; women account for 85% of consumer purchases in the U.S. and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mass media
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caters to the purchasers of advertized products, right?) to label
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; women as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potentially just as violent as men, given opportunity.
</EM><BR>
<P>A few points, then a more general discussion:
<BR>
<P>1. It is sometimes the case that people who feel that they have been
<BR>
aggrieved in same way, want to see acknowledgement and response from the
<BR>
aggressor. I can recall (no cite, sorry) reading about this, which is
<BR>
embodied in the hypothetical dialogue &quot;he did this and this, and i got
<BR>
really angry, but there's no response from him, nothing. he doesn't even get
<BR>
upset when i'm upset, can't he see i'm angry, why doesn't he acknowledge me,
<BR>
he just stands there, it doesn't even affect them, that really pisses me off
<BR>
...&quot;. This was in the context of domestic disputes, where the female
<BR>
acknowledged that she continually provoked the male until the male snapped
<BR>
and hit back: the provocations were either verbal or physical. I can relate
<BR>
this to observation of my own parents disputes as I was a child. That's not
<BR>
to say that there are also many cases where men beat up on women just for
<BR>
the sake of venting frustration, anger and whatever other purposes, which is
<BR>
also very wrong. I would like to see a study that takes into account several
<BR>
models and categorisations of behaviour. There are also submissive men that
<BR>
are at the behest of dominant women partners, that suffer in the same way
<BR>
that submissive women suffer in the hands of dominant male partners.
<BR>
2. Observational experiences at high school have shown situations where
<BR>
tough females have beaten up less-than-tough males. There were not as many
<BR>
cases as there are of males beating up males, mind you. However, the general
<BR>
credo is that &quot;a physical male&quot; never beat up a &quot;physical female&quot;,
<BR>
irrespective of differences in psychological composition. However, it was
<BR>
overlooked when a female beat up a male, and in fact, the female was given
<BR>
kudos, and the male relegated to being a &quot;wimp&quot; for not living upto his
<BR>
&quot;expected social conditioning&quot;. While I disagree with violence in general
<BR>
(but, in extreme cases, it may have its uses, when all other avenues have
<BR>
been exhausted or are assessed as unworkable), there is an inconsistency
<BR>
about the way it is viewed and accepted based upon &quot;physical gender&quot; as
<BR>
opposed to &quot;psychological gender&quot;, in the context of &quot;expected gender
<BR>
behaviour&quot; due to social conformance and conditioning.
<BR>
<P>I think that females have suffered far more at the hands of men, than
<BR>
otherwise. I also think that females have suffered due to the roles that
<BR>
society places upon them (Greer's assertion). I also think that men have
<BR>
suffered for the same reason (the male breadwinner, the relationship between
<BR>
work and self-esteem, etc).
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, and a good dose of Chomsky is required here, the debate is
<BR>
sometimes often stifled because of narrow mindedness at times. For instance,
<BR>
if I make a statement of the form &quot;females can be as violent as men&quot;, then I
<BR>
am categorised as fitting into the group of people that generally want to
<BR>
see a return to the dark ages; rather than having my comment assessed in and
<BR>
by itself.
<BR>
<P>Personal experience, through observation and reading, has illustrated
<BR>
anecdotally to me, that there are many effeminte males, and many masculine
<BR>
females, and many anywhere in the spectrum between the poles. It may be the
<BR>
statistical case that there are more effeminate females, than there are
<BR>
masculine females, though. In the same way, there are males attracted to
<BR>
males and females, and females attracted to females and males. Sometimes I
<BR>
have to wonder at whether physical gender is an appropriate categorisation,
<BR>
or pyschological nature/composition is a more accurate categorisation.
<BR>
<P>Contemporary society -- some do it better than others, and some segments do
<BR>
it better than others -- and future society, should recognise that
<BR>
individuals are in themselves a unique combination of various learning
<BR>
experiences and backgrounds. There is perhaps an argument that all
<BR>
individuals should conform to &quot;basic&quot; rules (i.e. some basic ethical rules
<BR>
about how to act in relationship with other people), but above that, each
<BR>
individual can be a unique being with any combination of behaviours, whether
<BR>
&quot;traditionally&quot; referred to as masculine or feminine.
<BR>
<P>It is interesting, for example, to find Jung discuss the reason why first
<BR>
marriages often fail -- and, this can be applied to many human-human,
<BR>
human-entity relationships -- which is because the person may be in &quot;love&quot;
<BR>
with a perception that they &quot;think&quot; the other person embodies. However, over
<BR>
time, they come to realise that the other person does not live up to these
<BR>
perceptions. Jung indicates that in marraige, it is due to people having
<BR>
models of behaviour they inherit from observation of opposite-sex parents,
<BR>
and their own observations of parental marraiges; hence they may expect
<BR>
their partner and marriage to operate similarly.
<BR>
<P>This may occur in some cultures more than others. I am Australia by
<BR>
background, so in our heterogenuous multi cultural society, this is more of
<BR>
an issue than it may be in other homogenous and stable cultures.
<BR>
Contemporary Australian cinema plays on these themes quite a bit.
<BR>
<P>Matthew.
