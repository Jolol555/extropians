<P>
While hunting down Damien's reference I found a short note in the Sep
<BR>
2, 1999 issue of Nature about a paradox I have often experienced while
<BR>
driving, so I thought I would share it here:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; From these results, we suggest that drivers are responding to an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illusion: namely, that the next lane on a congested road appears to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be moving faster than the driver's present lane, even when both lanes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have the same average speed. This occurs because vehicles spread out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when moving quickly and pack together when moving slowly. A driver can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; therefore overtake many vehicles in a brief time interval, but it takes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much longer for the driver to be overtaken by the same vehicles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Other aspects of human perception may accentuate the impression that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the next lane is moving faster. Differential surveillance can occur
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because drivers look forwards rather than backwards, so vehicles that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are overtaken become invisible very quickly, whereas vehicles that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overtake the index driver remain conspicuous for much longer. Moreover,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a driver is more likely to glance at the next lane for comparison when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he is relatively idle while moving slowly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even if attention was not focused in particular directions and was evenly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spaced in time, human psychology may make being overtaken (losing) seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more salient than the corresponding gains.  Furthermore, misconceptions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about randomness can make runs of overtaking and being overtaken seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unduly prolonged. Our study highlights the effects of congestion and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the increasing importance of the illusion, given that the number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; miles travelled by vehicles is increasing at a much faster rate than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the amount of roadway.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have in fact found that if I keep a running count, plus or minus, as
<BR>
cars pass me and I pass them back, I do find that the actual progress
<BR>
of the other line relative to my own is much less discouraging than my
<BR>
instincts suggest.  This has helped me stay calmer while driving.
<BR>
