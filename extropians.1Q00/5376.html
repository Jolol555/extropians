<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Actually most New Zealanders are women

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;Why is that?  Where have the men gone?

<EM>&gt; &gt;More boy babies are born than girl babies everywhere.

<EM>&gt; &gt;They die there after more rapidly.

<EM>&gt; This is what happens in general in primates where

<EM>&gt; females do more child raising than men.

<P>J Allman, A Hasentaub / Neurobiology of Aging 20 (1999) 447-454:
<BR>
&quot;Natural selection will tend to favor genes that enhance survival in adults
<BR>
in the sex that provides the most care for offspring. ...The death of a
<BR>
noncaretaking parent might even enhance the survival of its offspring by
<BR>
removing a competitor for scarce (food) resources. ...However, the human
<BR>
female survival advantage is smaller in percentage terms...probably due to
<BR>
the larger role of human males in parenting. ...The differential mortality
<BR>
between caretakers and noncaretakers comes in part from the former being
<BR>
risk-averse and the latter being risk-seeking. Risk-seekers constantly probe
<BR>
their world, seeking out new opportunities and detecting hazards in the
<BR>
constantly changing environment. Through their probing, they generate new
<BR>
information that they communicate to close kin, thus enhancing their kin's
<BR>
survival and the propagation of their shared genes....&quot;

<P>Excellent article in several different ways. Pointer provided by Anders many
<BR>
weeks ago.
