<EM>&gt; If a nano-gift economy evolves, it will be because open-source nanotech

<EM>&gt; outcompetes proprietary nanotech, an outcome I find easy to imagine.  As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Eric S. Raymond points out at considerable length, especially in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; truly excellent _The Magic Cauldron_, the best reasons for open-source
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have nothing to do with altruism.  Open-source code develops faster and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; works better.  Who wants to buy a clunky private spacewagon when they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can get a much more reliable one for free?
</EM><BR>
<P>Eliezer, while I applaud Eric and Open Source in general, as a programmer
<BR>
I must simply tell you that Open Source *does* have limitations.  If
<BR>
the complexity is too great, or the underlying architecture too poor
<BR>
or the number of people trying to simultaneously modify the same code
<BR>
too large (requiring someone to interpret the spagetti that results),
<BR>
then open-source may not be faster, nor work better.   This comes down
<BR>
to a fundamental problem that one programmer of the 100 lines of debugged
<BR>
code per day type is worth a lot more than 10 programmers of the 10 lines
<BR>
per day type.  Anyone who has worked on truely large software projects
<BR>
knows this to be true.  What makes software much better today and allows
<BR>
things like open-source to work is that we have built up the tool base
<BR>
so that we have programs to do the stupid stuff (like merging single
<BR>
line changes with no conflicts into open source) and better tools
<BR>
(perl + lots others), that make the 100 line/day programmers produce
<BR>
100 lines of much more productive code.
<BR>
<P>Now, returning to Damien's &amp; Robin's discussion about nano-gift economies.
<BR>
It *is* useful to look at combined government/philanthropic efforts and
<BR>
the industry sub-base that develops around those efforts.  In particular
<BR>
I am thinking of all the research funded by NIH (~$17 billion/yr now).
<BR>
Most of this research is only &quot;profitable&quot; on time scales much longer
<BR>
than those that would be considered by industry.  Yet, all of the money
<BR>
going into thousands of ideas proposed by individual researchers and
<BR>
approved by grant committees, does end up producing an &quot;industry&quot; of
<BR>
organizations (who actually make money), supplying the chemicals,
<BR>
reagents, instruments, etc. to do that research.
<BR>
<P>I look at NASA (where the initial motivation was largely political) or
<BR>
say the high-energy Physics community (where the interest was partially
<BR>
military and partially pure science) and how they have &quot;suffered&quot; over
<BR>
the last ~20 years and contrast that with NIH (where the politicians are
<BR>
falling all over themselves to throw money at them).  The major difference
<BR>
I see is the concrete personal benefits people see from the trickle-down
<BR>
effects of the NIH research.  One drug like Viagra (where the underlying
<BR>
science was funded by the NIH) is worth as much as a moon landing and there
<BR>
will be dozens of Viagras.  Another model worth considering is funding for
<BR>
vaccine development.  BigPharma &quot;generally&quot; doesn't like vaccines because they
<BR>
usually don't have high repeat sales.  So the government has to contract
<BR>
with BigPharma to produce the vaccines, or philanthropies like the
<BR>
Gates Foundation have to get into the game.
<BR>
<P>So, I think you might want to examine what will happen if the public
<BR>
at large, or a core group of scientists with political throw weight (e.g.
<BR>
the human genome project), or the Rockefeller/Gates/Ellison/etc.
<BR>
foundations get really &quot;convinced&quot; that nanotech is going to provide
<BR>
*huge* personal benefits.  The human genome project is a case in
<BR>
point, because you get people like HGS/Incyte/Celera developing
<BR>
ways to try and turn patents or database information into ROI and
<BR>
working really hard to run faster than the public researchers &amp; government.
<BR>
<P>You also want to look at the billions in VC money now available that
<BR>
has to go someplace.  I think the Internet/eBusiness trend should play
<BR>
out in a few years.  At that point the trend has to swing back to
<BR>
either Biotech or Nanotech.
