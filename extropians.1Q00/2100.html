<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I suppose it must have made some difference for some lives,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; but I have doubts that it is much difference for most lives.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; What evidence would you offer for this claim?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Foundation for Biomedical Research &lt;<A HREF="http://www.fbresearch.org">http://www.fbresearch.org</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a good place to start; they are an advocacy group, but they do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generally have their facts straight.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is true that most medical research on primates is not done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with great apes but rather with monkeys like tamarins and macaques
</EM><BR>
<P>That page's facts are mainly: <A HREF="http://www.fbresearch.org/nobels.htmOnly">http://www.fbresearch.org/nobels.htmOnly</A> one of
<BR>
the Medical Nobels listed from 1901 to 1998 used a great
<BR>
ape: chimps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; [insert generic &quot;slippery slope&quot; argument here].  It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is also true that the number of people who can specifically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trace improvements in their lives to specific uses of primate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; medical research are probably few.  But to judge the true impact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of this research, you have to include everyone who might have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contracted a disease but for a vaccine tested or researched on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; apes (AIDS is a major one but not the only), or who had any such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ancestor, or who benefited from an advance by one of those people,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or who benefited from an advance by someone who was affected by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one of those people...
</EM><BR>
<P>Since you mention AIDS, I'll mention that AIDS may have been causedby
<BR>
developing polio vaccine from chimp livers (see Hooper's book
<BR>
The River.)
<BR>
<P>Here are the questions to ask:
<BR>
1) How much have vaccines contributed to health?
<BR>
2) How much have great apes contributed to vaccines, over and above
<BR>
what could have been done with other animals?
<BR>
<P>The answer to the first question seems to be: suprisingly low.
<BR>
I suspect the answer to the second question has a similar answer.
