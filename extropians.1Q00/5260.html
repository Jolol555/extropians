I don't want to answer this post, I really don't. But a man's gotta do what

a man's gotta do.

<P><EM>&gt;Now surely Damien, you enjoy firing a gun?  Even if it

<EM>&gt;has been a long time?  
</EM><BR>
<P>I fired a cap-gun for a while about 45 years ago. My parents were furious,
<BR>
but I'd nagged my grandfather into buying it for me. He'd killed plenty of
<BR>
humans in France with his machine gun, and was full of shrapnel. I used to
<BR>
wash his lumpy back when I stayed with him because he couldn't reach, but
<BR>
he didn't sexually molest me or do anything to me with actual guns. His
<BR>
son, my uncle, had killed a few humans over Germany with his airplane. He
<BR>
couldn't talk about it and went mad after a while and died. My father
<BR>
killed nobody. He just precision-machined some gauges used to make machines
<BR>
that killed humans, so they didn't let him go into the line of fire. My
<BR>
mother made some too. That's how they met. They liked each other because
<BR>
they both played tennis. I can't play tennis, because I have no depth
<BR>
vision. This would be a big problem if I wanted to kill humans with
<BR>
firearms. Luckily, very few people in Australia have access to sidearms,
<BR>
because most of us regard possessing such lethal things somewhat the way we
<BR>
feel about the scene in FUTURAMA where the big ugly future dude at the
<BR>
weapons show shills a vial of Anthrax, `just for hunting purposes, naturally'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What is going on in Australia??  I thought you folks 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were as fierce on gun freedom as Americans but that is not what I am 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hearing.  
</EM><BR>
<P>You're probably thinking of Austria.
<BR>
<P>People who live in the country, or the bush as we call it, maybe 10 percent
<BR>
or less of the population I guess, often own those big long weapons you use
<BR>
to kill animals with. They tell the policeman about them, and he writes it
<BR>
down. Then when they kill humans  the policeman knows who did it. This
<BR>
doesn't work very well, because a while back a young sociopath shot dead a
<BR>
lot of humans because he felt sad and rejected. Now he lives in jail and
<BR>
everyone hates him even more. They don't let him have his weapons in there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The New Zealanders will invade and steal all your nation's women!! 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually most New Zealanders are women, and most of them aren't all that
<BR>
interested in Australia's women, who are also more than half of all
<BR>
Australians.
