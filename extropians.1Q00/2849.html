<P>
I thought Daniel Ust brought up some good thoughts on how resolving to live 
<BR>
longer and healthier can be hard and take a great deal of resolve.  I would 
<BR>
ask the people on the list, what are your &quot;rules to live by for life 
<BR>
extension&quot; that you both live now and also down the road?
<BR>
<P>I have been reading an excellent book,&quot;Dare to be 100&quot; by Walter Bortz, M.D. 
<BR>
and I recommend it.  The book is not a dull read.
<BR>
<P>Among his recommendations are...
<BR>
1.  Read &quot;Well to Eat Well&quot;
<BR>
2.  Know when to eat.
<BR>
3.  Count cholesterol.
<BR>
4.  Be fat aware.
<BR>
5.  Push carbos.
<BR>
6.  Examine the pros and cons of protein.
<BR>
7.  Have a proper exercise program.
<BR>
8.  A little salt is enough.
<BR>
9.  Keep your fiber up.
<BR>
10. Vitamin supplementation is good within limits.
<BR>
11. Calcium matters.
<BR>
12. Take it easy on the coffee.
<BR>
13. Look at alcohol, foe and friend
<BR>
14. Watch for &quot;chemical cuisine&quot;
<BR>
15. Beware of free radicals
<BR>
16. Use your diet to fight cancer
<BR>
17. Buckle up.
<BR>
18. Have an annual physical.
<BR>
<P>psychological factors
<BR>
19. Be necessary for those around you
<BR>
20. Find meaning in your life.
<BR>
21. Be an optimist.
<BR>
22. Take risks.
<BR>
23. Stay in control.
<BR>
24. Maintain the creative spark.
<BR>
25. Seek wisdom.
<BR>
26. Be a good neighbor.
<BR>
27. Cherish experience.
<BR>
28. Get high on helping.
<BR>
29. Learn to learn.
<BR>
30. Build memory.
<BR>
31. Keep order.
<BR>
32. Be attractive.
<BR>
33. Recognize that sex is for life.
<BR>
34. Stay in touch.
<BR>
35. Have pets.
<BR>
36. Keep family strong.
<BR>
37. Don't take yourself too seriously.
<BR>
38. Recognize depression.
<BR>
39. Recharge yourself.
<BR>
40. Think travel.
<BR>
41. Think when, where, and why retire?
<BR>
42. Make your last nest your best.
<BR>
43. Be wealth fit-Save.
<BR>
44. Lobby for yourself.
<BR>
45. Sleep enough.
<BR>
<P>I certainly have a ways to go but am proud of myself in some of these areas. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, the doctor who wrote the book did not mention things like 
<BR>
severe calorie restriction diets or cryonics but he did give a foundation 
<BR>
that could lead to a very long life or at least one that is not prematurely 
<BR>
shortened.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>

That said, life style changes often have to be made too. I think this can 
<BR>
include changes in diet and activities as well as attitudes, place of work, 
<BR>
place of residence, and the like. Those changes are harder to make, 
<BR>
especially since they often require a constant drive.
