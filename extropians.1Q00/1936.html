<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt; I recently rented (and subsequently bought) a videotape of the Truman 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sow.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Incredible movie. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     You mean you haven't got a DVD player yet?  Oh Randy get with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;times
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;video is sooooo 2nd Millennium.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I forget who came up with that line but I thought it was priceless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     That is a great movie though isn't it.  As far as acting, Carrey blew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Truman away when he played Andy Kaufman in Man on the Moon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt;When Truman came up against the wall at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the end of his world, it reminded me of my own revelation that death,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;although accepted as inevitable by all those around me, may not be so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inescapable as it appeared to everyone else.&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     I can relate to that too.  Very often when people bring up the &gt;topic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of death, I will inevitably mention that death &quot;may&quot; not be &gt;inevitable.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;When I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;try to explain that it is really just a problem with biology and it &gt;can be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;corrected, I usually get a look as if I just tore off my face and &gt;revealed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some terrifying Sci Fi creature.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hear you. We are quite different from the ordinary run of people. That's 
<BR>
all there is to it. Somehow we took another path to being people.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;I never understood why this should come as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a shock to people these days.  As a species human kind has been &gt;searching 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for the answer to immortality from the moment we realized &gt;that we are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;alive.
</EM><BR>
<P>Somehow when we (as opposed to all those others) read something, or come 
<BR>
across some knowledge, we understand it in a different way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have been searching for answers and now we are coming up with answers that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't involve having to die to get there.  Seems to me that there should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;less &quot;faith&quot; involved in physical immortality than the leap of faith or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gamble that there may be a spiritual after life involving a transference 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;another dimension, an alternate reality or even an unseen UFO in the tail 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a comet.  To me these are no longer valid options.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Then there is the old why would anyone want to live forever refrain. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;someone truly does not care if they die than they are not really living to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;begin with.  Ask the same person if they would be willing to die tomorrow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the answer is almost always &quot;no&quot;.  It should be obvious... That is the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;point!  Perhaps it's just another step in evolution or natures way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;choosing it's Immortals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I read a fascinating article today in Science News about how different modes 
<BR>
of reasoning are used by people of different cultures/continents. The 
<BR>
researchers tested reasoning skills of some people in Bumfuck Mongolia (East 
<BR>
Uzbeck). They posed a situation where they said that all bears in the 
<BR>
northern part of the world were white. They said that a man from the 
<BR>
northern part of the world had seen a bear. The researchers then asked the 
<BR>
tribesmen what color the bear must have been. Without exception, to the 
<BR>
growing  frustration of the researhers. all the men replied, &quot;Well, how 
<BR>
would I know?! Ask your friend who saw the bear!&quot;
<BR>
The study concluded, citing numerous other examples of typical cultural 
<BR>
reasoning, that analytical reasoning is a learned skill, and not something 
<BR>
innate, or something to that effect....
