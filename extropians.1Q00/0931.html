<P><EM>&gt; At least with topical pesticides you can wash them off, but if they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; built into the cells of the plant you can't help consuming them.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is that the complete biochemical profile of most of
<BR>
our food crops (esp. the many varieties) is poorly known.  They
<BR>
have a hard enough time with the 200+ chemicals in coffee alone.
<BR>
The *average* consumer still doesn't understand (a) the natural
<BR>
carcinogenicity of their food &amp; drink consumption; (b) whether
<BR>
there is a linear dose response or a threshold above which things
<BR>
are dangerous; and (c) the variability of the detoxification genes
<BR>
in individuals (that for example in some individuals make some
<BR>
of the compounds in cigarette smoke *more* carcinogenic!).
<BR>
<P>Getting public education up to this level is a goal to move towards.
<BR>
If you had public service anouncements in just these three areas
<BR>
it would at least get people &quot;thinking&quot; about this stuff.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know plants produce their own natural pesticides, but people will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; support engineering them to produce extra ones that they must consume.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Here again it is an education problem.  The Bt toxin, to my knowledge
<BR>
has been shown to be innocuous to human biochemistry.  Anyone know
<BR>
otherwise?  Similary with roundup.  Sure, if you consume kg of these
<BR>
substances they might be harmful, but so is water in similar quantities.
<BR>
<P>But, generally, I would agree.  In wealthy contries, they would support
<BR>
&quot;mega&quot;-vitamin vegetables (so they don't have to purchase the 1-a-days)
<BR>
a lot more than they would support increased yields/cheaper food prices.
