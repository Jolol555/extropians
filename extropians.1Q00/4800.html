Well, John, to be *blunt* (oh no, I hope the blunt police
<BR>
aren't around...) it depends a great deal on your
<BR>
&quot;rate-of-living&quot;.  I've been bicoastal (NY/LA &amp; NY/SF)
<BR>
in times past, and am now bicontinental (Nrth.Am.(SEA)/Eur(MOS)).
<BR>
While I don't recomend this as a life-extension strategy
<BR>
(even with melatonin), it does tend to push you to the
<BR>
limits of reality of the real rate-of-change in societies.
<BR>
<P>Now, I suspect the definition of fun in Alaska is
<BR>
a little different tnan SEA/NY/LA/SF/MOS.  Where you are living,
<BR>
it may take 30+ years to watch the restaurants turnover
<BR>
(once per generation????) &amp; that is probably interesting.
<BR>
Where I've lived the &quot;hot&quot; site is viable a few years or less.
<BR>
After you have seen a couple of turns, it makes sense
<BR>
to snooze for a while until something completely different
<BR>
comes along (e.g. I can't believe the degree to which
<BR>
young people, now-a-days, are getting various accessories
<BR>
put into or onto their bodies).  In a fast-turn environment
<BR>
that may take decades, in a slow-turn environment that may
<BR>
take centuries.  Arguably, information transfer will compress
<BR>
the lag-time from the fast-turn to the slow-turn environments.
<BR>
<P>However, the *main* point to my &quot;freeze young&quot; proposal
<BR>
was in the context where &quot;young&quot; means mentally &quot;adept&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;flexible&quot;.  It is an open question regarding the degree
<BR>
to which the brain &quot;solidifies&quot; as one accumulates experiences,
<BR>
but it is clear that diseases like Alzheimer's, if allowed
<BR>
to progress, give you a *clearly* different brain than the
<BR>
one you might like to be able to recover.
<BR>
<P>My comments regarding &quot;youth&quot; were primarily intended to
<BR>
direct attention to the problem of preserving functionality
<BR>
and identity rather than some chronological age.
<BR>
<P>Robert
