<BR>
<EM>&gt; Question please: is there a term for the point in history where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life extension technology is increasing our life expectancy one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year for each year one lives, such that the mathematical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; expectation of ones remaining life stops decreasing?  That
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point I suspect is 20-30 yrs away.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's a good question.  Maybe you could call it the &quot;longevity
<BR>
break-even point&quot; or something similar.  Or you could define the
<BR>
&quot;longevity ratio&quot; as the rate at which longevity is increasing
<BR>
per elapsed time.
<BR>
<P>One thing to keep in mind, official life expectancies are calculated by
<BR>
taking the death rate at each age TODAY, and combining them.  This tells
<BR>
you how long person born today would live if, as he aged, he had the same
<BR>
probability of death at each age that a person of that age does today.
<BR>
<P>This is a pretty unrealistic model because even if medicine (or whatever
<BR>
it is which gets credit for longevity) were somehow frozen at today's
<BR>
level, some of the health improvements at younger ages would probably
<BR>
cause decreased death rates when older, just because of less damage to
<BR>
the body.  However it is a figure that can be derived unambiguously
<BR>
from current statistics, and it does serve as a benchmark to measure
<BR>
longevity improvements from one decade to the next.
<BR>
<P>&quot;The average American life span rose to 76.5 years in 1997, up from
<BR>
76.1 years in 1996.&quot;  <A HREF="http://onhealth.com/ch1/briefs/item,46909.asp">http://onhealth.com/ch1/briefs/item,46909.asp</A>.
<BR>
This would give us a longevity ratio of 0.4 that year.  However I think
<BR>
this may have been be a statistical glitch, I saw something about them
<BR>
changing how longevity was calculated in 1997.  Here is a table from
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus_95.pdf">http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus_95.pdf</A>, to which I have added the &quot;LR&quot;
<BR>
or longevity ratio, calculated by dividing the increase by the number
<BR>
of years.
<BR>
<P>Year  Life    LR
<BR>
1900  47.3 
<BR>
1950  68.2    0.41
<BR>
1960  69.7    0.15
<BR>
1970  70.8    0.11
<BR>
1980  73.7    0.29
<BR>
1984  74.7    0.25
<BR>
1985  74.7    0.0
<BR>
1986  74.7    0.0
<BR>
1987  74.9    0.2
<BR>
1988  74.9    0.0
<BR>
1989  75.1    0.2
<BR>
1990  75.4    0.3
<BR>
1991  75.5    0.1
<BR>
1992  75.8    0.3
<BR>
1993  75.5   -0.3
<BR>
&lt;add two figures from above&gt;
<BR>
1996  76.1    0.2
<BR>
1997  76.5    0.4
<BR>
<P>Obviously there has been considerable variation in the longevity rate
<BR>
figure from year to year and from decade to decade.  The trend has not
<BR>
been very stable.  Generally we have been in the .1 to .3 range for the
<BR>
last several decades.  At this point it looks to me like we would need
<BR>
a major new breakthrough to start this figure heading up towards 1.0.
