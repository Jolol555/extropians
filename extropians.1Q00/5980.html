Friends (and I really, really do mean that),
<BR>
<P>My apologies in advance.  Political rant coming.  Memetic defenses to maximum.

<P><EM>&gt;Its been conclusively shown that there IS no third world hunger problem,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;at least as far as food production is concerned. The agricultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;production in the 3rd world is sufficient for a 3500 calorie diet for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every man, woman, and child. What the problem is is that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;transportation, processing, and storage infrastructure is either poor or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;non-existent, so much or most of that food goes to waste. Additionally,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;most ALL 'famines' are the creations of governments as tools of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;opression and/or warfare. You want to 'solve' world hunger, solve those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;problems. The food is already out there.
</EM><BR>
<P>The following is not to be taken as FACT, it is my impression, my suspicion...
<BR>
<P>It is my impression that the &quot;kleptocracies&quot; (the phrase I use is &quot;dominant
<BR>
elite&quot;) which dominate these countries, so that they may enjoy a standard
<BR>
of living close to that of the developing nations, quite naturally control
<BR>
any and all income-producing resources, including the best agricultural
<BR>
land.  On that land they choose to produce cash crops.  That is,
<BR>
agricultural products that they can sell on the international market for
<BR>
hard currency.  So, they control the land, produce and sell the crops, and
<BR>
keep the money.  Private property economics at its most basic.  The people
<BR>
with the guns (supplied by the &quot;foreign aid&quot; of the nations whose
<BR>
corporations want to purchase the agricultural products) &quot;own&quot; the
<BR>
property, and the &quot;little&quot; people get to use whatever land--marginal or
<BR>
submarginal--is left over (until improvements in agricultural technology
<BR>
make formerly marginal land newly viable economically--at which time it's
<BR>
&quot;move on, you squatters; you don't &quot;own&quot; this land.&quot;)  Classic (unfettered)
<BR>
capitalism, the ruthless enemy of humanity.   (Er, sorry.  Ignore that
<BR>
last.  I was once a socia... er, ...human being.)
<BR>
<P>One additional note.  When all those old colonial powers left and went
<BR>
home, you think they abandoned all that they had gained?  Yeah, right!
<BR>
Consider that they left in place all the legal structures which defined
<BR>
property ownership, specifically, who it was that owned anything,
<BR>
everything, of value.  Then, though they had left, they maintained
<BR>
relationships with the &quot;new owners&quot;, continuing at some remove the flow of
<BR>
benefits achieved through the earlier &quot;colonial&quot; conquest.
<BR>
<P>Mike's right..  There's plenty of food.  It's human decency that's in short
<BR>
supply.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Everything's hard till you know how to do it.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ray Charles
