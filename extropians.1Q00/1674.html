<P>
<EM>&gt; All nonsense, she cried, you just want a world of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soulless cyborgs. A computer can't do anything of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its own accord, a computer can't have consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh? Why not? *It's not alive! It can only do what 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's programmed to do. I'm a sociologist! I'm a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; utilitarian! I'm a sociologist and I'm here to tell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you that computers can't do anything unless they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programmed to do it.*  And so on. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Far too many people tend to assume that just because
<BR>
they're a student/grad/teacher/worker in such-and-such
<BR>
a field, they know everything - for some, just
<BR>
'everything in that field', but for the even more
<BR>
frighteningly close-minded, it's 'everything, period'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I mentioned that she was also programmed, by genes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and culture, and she got highly indignant. I was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trying to pretend she was a machine! She did things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *just because she wanted to*! She'd broken away from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the restrictions of her social upbringing etc etc. 
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Aaack! A new idea! Get rid of it, quick, before it
<BR>
disrupts my karma any further!&quot; (Just joking here... I
<BR>
hope) :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; By this point I suppose I was patently a tool of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hell, except that presumably she didn't actually 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe in hell or souls, just in `life'. 
</EM><BR>
<P>....as long as that 'life' doesn't try to improve
<BR>
itself ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I went sideways. Suppose we insert a very thin tube
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into a person's head and replace a single neuron 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with a-- Ah, yes, you'd like to do that, wouldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, your type!  Chop people's brains up, turn them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into machines without souls. No, hang on, let's say 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you just did this with a mouse-- I could see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; her delighted confirmation as my gleeful robotic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cruelty to our dumb animal brethren was shamelessly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revealed. And so on.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, so now we're a 'type', hmmm? :) &quot;Aaah! Swat that
<BR>
idea! Back, back, I say! Down! Bad idea! No biscuit!&quot;
<BR>
;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Altogether frustrating, because presumably she 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wasn't stupid or unimaginative (she read some sort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of sf, after all). 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah. Not stupid or unimaginative, just... what's a good
<BR>
word for people like this? Stuck in their own concepts
<BR>
of things, and anything that encroaches on one of
<BR>
their reality-bubbles gets a resounding cry of &quot;Back,
<BR>
vile thing!&quot; :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It was a salutary experience, giving me some sense
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; what the *real* opposition might be like, out there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the world in its teeming blithering bigoted 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; billions. Urp.
</EM><BR>
<P>'Teeming blithering bigoted billions'. Quite a
<BR>
(far-too-much, I fear) apt description! :)
<BR>
<P>Onward,
<BR>
