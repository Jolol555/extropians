<EM>&gt;From: Dan Fabulich &lt;<A HREF="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20Surveilance%20was:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000330012038.24493.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I never said it would be a &quot;simple system.&quot;  It will likely take the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;help of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; strong AI and nanotech.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I see.  Allow me to refine my argument then.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You seem to agree with me that a Whole Lot of Data Crunching would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessary to make this system viable.  Now, clearly, if I have access to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;data-cruncher and you don't, even if we both have access to all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cameras, I'm getting a lot more use out of the system than you are.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Indeed, without a data-cruncher, the system is almost useless to you in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comparison to its utility to me.  This point can be generalized: if I can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;crunch data better than you can, then I'll get more use out of the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than you can.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think I addressed this in my earlier reply.  You know the bit about &quot;think 
<BR>
distributed computing, intelligent agents reporting back to you&quot; and all 
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;But let's recall how this point came up in the first place.  The assertion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was that this system would be more useful to someone with more power than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would to someone with less power.  The reason given was because the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people with more power would be able to crunch data better, and thereby
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get more use out of the system.  You countered that people wouldn't have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to crunch the data at all.  But, clearly, SOMEONE has to crunch the data.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;If you'd have it that a strong AI would do the work, fine, but strong AIs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;require fast processors as their substrate.  Whoever owns the processors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;owns the results which this AI would put out.  This someone will be the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;powerful, and not the weak.
</EM><BR>
<P>I addressed this earlier too.  You know, (1) it doesn't matter who's running 
<BR>
the system as long as its sufficiently and verifiably transparent (2) the 
<BR>
web analogy (&quot;tons of data, hardly any data crunching&quot;) (3) 
<BR>
government-civilian oversight committees, etc., etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; In a truly transparent society there would be no &quot;despots&quot; unless we the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; people collectively decided to turn our fates over to a despot.  I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know about you, but I ain't voting for any despots anytime soon.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;But I am your king!&quot;  &quot;Well, I didn't vote for you.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Look, I'm trying to be civil here, but I can't make any sense of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;claim.  How the hell do you think despots get to power, anyway?  By
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;popular vote?  They sure as hell don't go around knocking on doors and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kissing babies and asking for your support.  Instead, they kick someone's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ass, and then make the plausible claim that they'll kick the ass of anyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who tries to harm them.  Nobody &quot;turns their fates over to a despot.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They simply don't rise up, out of fear that they'll be squashed like a bug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if they do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure I might be worried about that if I lived someplace other than the US or 
<BR>
sometime other than 2000 a.d.  But the fact of the matter is that if you 
<BR>
plan to take over the US and overturn our democratic republic you will have 
<BR>
to (1) control the military and (2) somehow convince the military to (a) 
<BR>
attack their friends and families and (b) do away with the civil liberties 
<BR>
that we as a society have fought and died to preserve for over 200 years, 
<BR>
all for the privilege of being able to call you King.
<BR>
<P>How would you *possibly* do that?  How could you possibly form the military, 
<BR>
economic and strategic alliances necessary to accomplish that ludicrous goal 
<BR>
in a transparent society without somebody getting wind of what you're up to 
<BR>
and ruining your party?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Despotism doesn't, at any step of the picture, rely on secrecy in any way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;whatsoever.  On the contrary, perfect transparency is in the despot's best
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interests.
</EM><BR>
<P>What?!?  Are you kidding??  How long do you think Saddam Hussein would stay 
<BR>
in power in a transparent society?  I'll tell you, approximately 2 minutes.  
<BR>
The despot keeps the populace in constant fear because they never know who 
<BR>
to trust because your neighbor might be one of the despot's secret police 
<BR>
henchmen.  Why do you think every oppressive, despotic government *always* 
<BR>
*ALWAYS* has a secret police.  Why do you think that establishing the secret 
<BR>
police is one of the *first* things a totalitarian government does?  Why do 
<BR>
you think they call secret police &quot;secret?&quot;  How would you set up a &quot;secret&quot; 
<BR>
police force in a *transparent* society?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;That way you can be quite confident that when the despot
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;claims that he'll squash you like a bug, he *really will* squash you like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a bug.  Knowing that someone is a despot does not help you get rid of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;despot in any way whatsoever.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, but knowing who his sympathizers are and who the opposition is, and 
<BR>
the fact that the opposition outnumbers the despot and his henchmen will 
<BR>
give you a hint as to what to do to regain your freedom, don't ya think?
<BR>
