unrestricted in your ability to do repairs at molecular scale, and in

your ability to kickstart a reconstructed organism. If you are, then

uploading wins house high. There are no such obvious restrictions on

complexity of bit twiddling. Digital filters can be made to do

anything doable, and numerical crunch is truly cheap if you have

computronium computronium, especially if processing time is of little

freezing/vitrification has a subthreshold (loosely defined) inflatory

effect on the size of the target area in persona space you're trying

to reconstruct.

<P>That information is irreclaimably destroyed, thus introducing

uncertainty into/removing constraints from the to-be-reconstructed

persona space, is not open to doubt. It's still debatable, however,

how many bits actually go into the big bitbucket in the sky. Is it

enough, that the amount of constraints left indicate more that merely

that you've been a human?

<P>You're guessing here. You optimistically assume that the mind is

pretty engramic/holographic, and ubiquitous but limited-scale damage

just degrades your hologram very slightly. Try running your
<BR>
interference fringes through an FFT, then a high-frequency filter and
<BR>
inverse FFT, then see how your hologram looks like.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; practical question is extracting the information without causing exactly

<EM> &gt; the sort of atomic-scale disruption that would destroy that level of

<P>I am in the process of scanning some EM slides, depicting neurotissue

damage occuring on all scales (forget about microns), both in the
<BR>
typical cryonics patient, and the unrealistic best case (rabbit

vitrification/controls). After I get some people (F*hy, Darwin) to
<BR>
write interpretations of these, I'll put them online, for your
<BR>
edification/little screams of horror.

<P>While there will be still copious room for denial, at least we can

then restrict proliferation of pure fabrication.
