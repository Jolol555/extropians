<EM>&gt; &gt; I was thinking that &quot;stuff vitamin pills down your neck&quot; might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; closer to the mark, but I am suspicious about how many of us actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; try practical life extension, and how many of us just wait for the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; miracle cure...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If there _were_ such a thing as practical life extension, many of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us would no doubt do that.  But while there have been many studies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showing some correlations between diets containing certain nutrients
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and certain health benefits, there has not been a single study I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aware of to show that popping vitamin pills has any positive health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; benefit at all.
</EM><BR>
<P>What about the UCLA study of vitamin C published in 1992?  This was not the
<BR>
most rigorous study, but it tracked over 11K individuals over about a
<BR>
decade.  The findings?  Men taking 800 mg of vitamin C per day lived about 6
<BR>
years longer than those taking 60 mg of the same per day.  Another 9 year
<BR>
study completed in 1996 with a similar population size seemed to confirm
<BR>
this, though the study focused on vitamins C and E, rather than just vitamin
<BR>
C.  Granted, those are only two studies, but that beat Lee Daniel's above
<BR>
statement.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure others can dig up more studies.  The problem is long term studies
<BR>
of these things in humans take a long time.  (I know:  Big suprise!:)  A lot
<BR>
of short term studies of vitamin C and other supplements also seem to back
<BR>
the claim that people in general should strongly consider supplementation.
<BR>
<P>It's also notable that in many of these studies, the doses used are often in
<BR>
excess of what one can reasonably get from one's diet.  I consume several
<BR>
grams of C, e.g., a day.  If I was to try to get the same from oranges, I'd
<BR>
probably wouldn't be able to eat much else.:)
<BR>
<P>Vitamin C is only the tip of the iceberg, though, in supplements.  And,
<BR>
again, I don't supplements should be viewed as the first and last word in
<BR>
life extension.  Diet and other life style modification should be included.
<BR>
<P>And I also freely admit that a lot of supplements are overhyped and
<BR>
sometimes consumer expectations are very high.  There's, e.g., no pill you
<BR>
can take, I know of, that will make you twenty years younger (which would
<BR>
put me back in diapers... almost:) overnight.
<BR>
<P>Another thing that is important is medical testing.  Getting involved in a
<BR>
life extension regimen should involve such testing to make sure the patient
<BR>
is getting the right amounts and also, in the cases of substances which are
<BR>
toxic at high doses (not many supplements are, but don't take that as a
<BR>
blanket statement that everything is safe), not doing any damage.  One also
<BR>
wants to make sure one isn't wasting time and money.
<BR>
<P>I urge people on this list to look up the studies, some of which are cited
<BR>
at www.lef.org , and make your judgment based on knowledge -- not on the
<BR>
above quoted passage.:)  (No offense, Lee Daniel, but you sound like the
<BR>
stypical cynic here.:)
<BR>
<P>Also, where is Doug Skrecky!?!:)
