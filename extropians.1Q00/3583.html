<EM>&gt;  &gt; I guess you missed my irony. I agree with you, but despite the fun logical tricks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; of people like John Clark, an upload created from a scan is NOT the same individual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; as the individual who was scanned.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How can you say that? You sure can't compare that to the Real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thing(tm), because it's gone (the scan was destructive).
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, I was under the impression that we were talking about non-destructive scans. However,
<BR>
be that as it may, even with destructive scans, I know who is who. The original is dead.
<BR>
Thanks to scanning technology, there is an almost exact copy who thinks he is the original
<BR>
but is not. The original may have set a will naming the future scanned copy as his heir,
<BR>
and all of the original's friends and associates would not be able to tell if the copy is
<BR>
or is not the original. As I said, the rest of the world may think the copy is the
<BR>
original, but to the original individual, the rest of the world can suck eggs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And in the hypothetical case you could create an exact clone, you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of course know that it bifurcates (gives rise to two individua) as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; soon as it is allowed to evolve (unless these are exactly synched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deterministic clones receiving exactly the same input, which is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hypothetical in machina-only scenario).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is all as clear as mud. I wonder what logical tricks you speak of.
</EM><BR>
<P>Johns old short stories about the guy who makes a copy of himself, one kills the other
<BR>
(not sure which), etc... All John illustrates is that the rest of the world can't tell the
<BR>
difference, and if the original is too forgetful using John's magical duplication process,
<BR>
it may lose track of or not be able to prove that it is the original, but I say there is
<BR>
an easy way to tell, so long as the duplication process does not duplicate to the exact
<BR>
isotopic ratios. In addition, any one who has been a corpsicle and revived will have
<BR>
carbon 14 ratios that are markedly different than a new chick, at least for some period of
<BR>
time after revival.
