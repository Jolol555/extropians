<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   By raising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   enough money to implement such a strategy against multiple
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   companies, a few are bound to hit for the big bucks, given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the statistics of invalidity of most software patents.
</EM><BR>
<P>What is he referring to here regarding statistics?  Is it the case that
<BR>
most patent suits against software patents go against the patent holder?
<BR>
Or a substantial percentage?  I had always heard that defeating patents
<BR>
was a costly and highly uncertain process, since the presumption is on
<BR>
the validity of the patent once it issues.
<BR>
<P>Of course, given the huge number of software patents and the tiny
<BR>
percentage that could possibly be litigated, even if a considerable
<BR>
percentage were overturned this could be because these are the weakest
<BR>
.01% of all the software patents.  It may not be easy to find patents
<BR>
that can be defeated in this way.
<BR>
<P>In my field, cryptography, there are a lot of patents.  But I wouldn't
<BR>
say that many of them could be overturned on the basis of prior art.
<BR>
Obviousness might be more questionable, utility even more so, but those
<BR>
are relatively fuzzy criteria.
<BR>
<P>People are creative, and there is no shortage of new ideas coming out all
<BR>
the time.  There is no reason a priori to expect most software patents
<BR>
to be invalid.  Someone creative enough to get a paper published in a
<BR>
refereed journal is capable of coming up with a patentable idea.  There
<BR>
are hundreds of thousands of people like this.
