<EM>&gt; &gt; When talking nano, the best defense is an infallible, impenetrable and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; non-hackable offense.  For your plan to work, your offense would have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to be practically perfect and everyone else's offense would have to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; imperfect.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;No, you DONT need a *PERFECT* defense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Lets assume an active shield defense made out of a large amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;separate bots. Then what you need, to overcome any enemy attack, is :
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;More resources at standby than the attacker, and a way to detect if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your own defense bots are not secretly modified by the attacker.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Your defense bots may be less efficient in destroying and detecting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;enemy bots, as long is this is compensated by a larger amount of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;defense/attack resources.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe I'm dense, but it seems to me that if the attacker has *replicating* 
<BR>
bots, your shield would have to be so tight as to prevent even a single bot 
<BR>
from getting through your defenses.  Because if just *one* gets through, it 
<BR>
can fairly quickly become billions.  And then you are in trouble, no?
<BR>
<P>And how would you possibly build a shield so tight that not a single 
<BR>
attacker could get through without turning every available atom into part of 
<BR>
your shield?  Obviously if every available atom is part of the shield, there 
<BR>
is nothing left for the shield to shield.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;For example if you have a hundred times as many defensebots (and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bots are of the same order of size as the attacker) then all your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;defense bots need to do is seek out and destroy the enemy bots.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Because you have a hundred times the amount of bots, you dont need a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perfect way to destroy the enemy bots. Your defense bots only have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be more than 1% effective in destroying the enemy bots than vice versa!
</EM><BR>
<P>That seems like a big if.  How can you be confident that the &quot;good guys&quot; 
<BR>
will have such a huge disparity in their favor?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think its quite unlikely that (assuming you try staying informed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about the latest technology) your enemy can get ahead in technology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by such a large amount that its bots are a hundred times more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;effective at attacking. (It could even be fundamentally impossible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to make a hundred times more effective attacking bots.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Seems to me that these issues will really assert themselves as we approach 
<BR>
the Singularity.  And, by definition, you cannot say what will happen past 
<BR>
that point.  When you throw things into the mix like self-evolving machine 
<BR>
intelligences and the resulting acceleration of the exponential growth of 
<BR>
technology, a .001% technological advantage by your enemy could well spell 
<BR>
your doom.
<BR>
<P>And remember, these will be *knowledge* based weapons and defenses.  It 
<BR>
won't take a huge economy or brick-and-mortar infrastructure to take 
<BR>
advantage of them.  All it takes is a revolutionary *idea* to give you a 
<BR>
significant advantage over the competition.  Look at how Craig Ventner got 
<BR>
the drop on the huge international Human Genome project with what turned out 
<BR>
to be a very good idea.  He didn't have nearly the human or financial 
<BR>
resources of the Human Genome project.  All he basically had was a good 
<BR>
idea, and now he's got the international genetics community on the run!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Of course, you will have to keep an eye on your potential enemies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to check if they are not trying to create more resources than you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can overcome with your own defense resources available.
</EM><BR>
<P>Chances are your enemies will not take kindly to your keeping an eye on 
<BR>
them, and will use all their available resources to prevent you from doing 
<BR>
that.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The most difficult detail could be in the mechanisms used for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;detection of modification to your own defense bots. Maybe some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kind of public key certificate system could be used, where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;secret key is destroyed by the bot when its integrity is expected
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be violated. (When all public key systems are rendered useless,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because of for example quantum computers, a secret key system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with some heavily guarded central lookup systems could be used
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in stead. However this last option is more vulnerable and less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;efficient.) These will be used together with external
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;recognition mechanisms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;However all these detection mechanisms dont need to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;perfect 100% efficiency. In case of a 100 times more resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would already be sufficient to have more than 1% efficiency!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(When assuming the same destruction efficiency as the enemy.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Again you are assuming a huge resource disparity between you and your enemy. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you base that on?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Im fairly confident that detection mechanisms with a certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;limited efficiency are possible.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So ultimately it all comes down to who has the most resources
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(e.g. the most defense/attack bots at hand). And the one who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;starts first creating these resources will thus have the edge.
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, if you start first you will probably have the edge (although see my 
<BR>
argument above about Craig Ventner and revolutionary ideas in the age of 
<BR>
information-based weapons systems).  But if you look around, you will see 
<BR>
that *everyone* is starting first.  The US, Europe and Japan (and perhaps 
<BR>
others) all have very active nano-research programs underway.  There is no 
<BR>
way to tell who is closest to creating an assembler.  The first to develop 
<BR>
the assembler can take over the world.  How do you prevent that if you are 
<BR>
not the first assembler maker?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(However this is assuming that no fundamentally new physics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will be discovered by your enemy that you are not aware of.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really worried about that.  We're not talking about making things *that* 
<BR>
small.
