<P>I can remember how in the eighties, companies would boast of flextime and 
<BR>
providing childcare to show how progressive they were.  I would like to see 
<BR>
the pseudo company become common if it could be competitive by being well 
<BR>
run.  I remember a 60 Minutes story about a steel mill where the workers 
<BR>
actually bought it and then ran it for a profit.

alternatively, &quot;work&quot; will cease to take center place in our lives, in the 
<BR>
same way that &quot;farming&quot; has gone from 98% of the economy to 2% of the 
<BR>
economy.

<BR>
<P>Cool!  So we only work for personal satisfaction and for status?  Sounds 
<BR>
good to me!  The farming analogy is interesting.  I suppose you meant 
<BR>
working for the base necessities of life.  I could see powerful gov't and 
<BR>
corporate interests wanting to stop this level of prosperity and personal 
<BR>
freedom from ever happening, though.
