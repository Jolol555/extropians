NOTE: This is a reply to a private correspondence I received
<BR>
from Robert; it bounced, however, using the address that
<BR>
Robert provided me. I have decided to publically post my
<BR>
reply, with Robert's message largely deleted.

<P><EM>&gt; Whether or not we have differences regarding strategies,

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such ideas is probably of benefit... 
</EM><BR>
<P>Dear Robert,
<BR>
<P>I completely agree.  Perhaps it would be well for me to
<BR>
make a distinction between my sometime intention to
<BR>
advocate, and at others to test, ideas. My latest post
<BR>
is of the latter kind: in response to your suggestion that
<BR>
memetic re-education is required, I found myself thinking
<BR>
&quot;that is correct&quot;, but what would the community need to
<BR>
DO, be WILLING to do, to actually implement this mission?
<BR>
<P>This illustrates what I mean by &quot;test&quot;; not the validity,
<BR>
organizational &quot;fit&quot;, feasibility or philosophic virtue, but
<BR>
the WILLINGNESS OF THE MEMBERSHIP TO ACT, WORK
<BR>
RISK AND SACRIFICE for the idea (rather than in effect
<BR>
referring it back to committee for further study).
<BR>
<P>Where are the genuine ACTIVISTS in this population --
<BR>
not polemicists, not opportunists, not wannabes, but 
<BR>
individuals who really want to accomplish something
<BR>
other than rhetorical victories?
<BR>
<P>Finally, I want you to believe that however assertively
<BR>
I may present my current views on directions, approaches,
<BR>
tactics and strategies, I am in every case most willing
<BR>
to compromise, or relinquish, as necessary for the  success
<BR>
of our endeavor.  I would much rather cooperate with a plan
<BR>
I am not optimistic about than do nothing. I feel, as you can
<BR>
sense, disturbed about what I see as a tendency of this group
<BR>
to lose focus on action* and rather dissipate themselves in
<BR>
interminable debate, frivolous projects, mind-games or pleasur-
<BR>
able but irrelevant chat that costs them nothing.
<BR>
<P>This means that I'm seeking a tough-minded group that will
<BR>
be known publicly, not as people who desire to live forever,
<BR>
but as dedicated idealists who fully intend to do precisely that
<BR>
--despite mindless opposition, ridicule, personal risk and
<BR>
daunting trials.
<BR>
<P>Sincerely,
<BR>
<P>Bob

*I include under the rubric of &quot;action&quot; the onerously difficult and
<BR>
incredibly exhausting work of formulating doctrine that meets
<BR>
the highest possible intellectual standards.
