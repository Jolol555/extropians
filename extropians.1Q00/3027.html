I think a Deep Anarchy list is a very good idea provided
<BR>
there is an interest in such a list.  Even if it starts out
<BR>
relatively small, it could still be useful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;A main point of Max's article is that we already have anarchy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so there's no need to establish it. To me it seems that coercive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political systems are complete hoaxes. Deep Anarchy is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;view you have once you recognize the deep nature of coercive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political systems.
</EM><BR>
<P>Max's idea in the Deep Anarchy article (&quot;that we already
<BR>
live in an anarchy&quot;) is a very important insight.  Just because
<BR>
some individuals masquerade as &quot;government&quot; (so-called)
<BR>
doesn't change that fact (that we already have anarchy).

<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; I'm toying with the idea of setting up a Deep Anarchy list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; (In DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;THE STATE&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml</A>&gt;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; Max coined the term &quot;Deep Anarchy.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; According to Max T. O'Connor (aka Max More):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt; &quot;Deep Anarchy&quot; is the view that results from these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; thoughts; it is the idea that we already live in an anarchy.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Its not totally a bad idea. Considering how much libertarian thought has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;been shaping politics the last ten years, it does seem to be working a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;bit. The problem is that in joining the establishment, your goals become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;diluted, and the people wind up with a sweetened, more palatable and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;managable version. Witness how socialists in the democratic parties of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the west were able to turn former laissez faire economies into compound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;economies of mercantilists using socialist governments to manage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;dopify the people, and to allow and organize the externalization of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;mercantilists costs. Because of this, there was never a revolution of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the proletariat in the west.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;To establish a true anarchy a 'Deep' anarchy, the nihilistic methods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;must be used as taught in the ChiCom schools.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;A main point of Max's article is that we already have anarchy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so there's no need to establish it. To me it seems that coercive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political systems are complete hoaxes. Deep Anarchy is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;view you have once you recognize the deep nature of coercive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;political systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Entice the establishment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;of powerful police forces and the abuse or negation of civil rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Atrocities ensue which trigger further rebellion and calls for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;fascism. There are key points where events can be interrupted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;establish either fascist totalitarianism or anarchy, and the key to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;which way the population chooses all depends on the propaganda war.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;This does not necessarily need to mean actual physical violence in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;real world. Since more of the economy is moving to the net, cyber
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;terrorism takes on new power, as seen by events in the last few weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;with DoS attacks on prime dot com websites. The problem is figuring out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;how to entice opressive measures by government over the net. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;currently seems that the government is resisting the reprisal/repression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;urge.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The purpose of the list probably needs to include exploring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;what strategies and tactics may be necessary to persuade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people to adopt the Deep-Anarchy view. And once people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have the Deep-Anarchy view, what freedom strategies should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they practice?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Anyone who looks at the back seat of my Cherokee knows I at least live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;in one... ;) I'm not so sure about the rest of you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; The purpose of the list might be to explore the deepest aspects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; of coercive political systems, including the possibility that all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; current coercive political systems are complete hoaxes.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maybe, what needs to be looked at and seen is that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;individuals who masquerade as &quot;government&quot; (so-called)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are engaged in a gigantic hoax. How can anyone form a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;different conclusion after studying Max's article?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; &gt; Anyone interested?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Certainly, so long as it doesn't get inundated by anarchists who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;closet socialists (the whole Eugene gang).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Mike Lorrey
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Initially the list could be promoted to libertarian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarcho-capitalist types. After it has 100+ subscribers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and has been going for a month or two, it could also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be promoted to other anarchists.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Maybe means can be found to bridge the gap between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right and left anarchists. In an anarcho-capitalist world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with property rights, left anarchists can acquire property
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and can, on that property, implement socialist systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Provided they don't attempt to coercively impose their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;systems on others, they wouldn't disturb harmony.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The list guidelines could spell out how right and left
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anarchists might coexist harmoniously. Attacks between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;right and left anarchists would be discouraged. The list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be moderated.
