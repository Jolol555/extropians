<EM> &gt; &lt;&lt; To denigrate the weakening of the definition of intelligence &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; You keep saying 'including abilities denigrates, or weakens intelligence'.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Explain how this happens. I see no reason that adding other abilities to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; intelligence somehow magically waters mathematical / verbal abstract 
</EM><BR>
symbolic
<BR>
<EM> &gt; reasoning down. It doesn't makes that behavior less valuable, inherently, it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; just raises other behaviors up. That's like saying if other people get
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; taller, you'll be shorter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not at all. Lets say that the Anti-Grey Defamation League decides that grey is
<BR>
discriminated against because its not considered a real color by publishers,
<BR>
graphic artists, painters, etc... Since white is considered a color, and 
<BR>
there is
<BR>
so much use of white everywhere (its the default color on a blank page), the
<BR>
proponents of grey decide that they will promote the idea that pure white is
<BR>
merely one type of white, and that there are many other whites out there,
<BR>
including all the different types of grey. Grey won't be called grey anymore,
<BR>
because thats demeaning. Instead grey will be called 'a shade of white'. This
<BR>
becomes popular in academia and the popular media, as well as with major
<BR>
pro-grey-ist organizations like the teachers unions, etc. who propagandize the
<BR>
concept to all of the different publications in the libraries of the world,
<BR>
saying that all colors are merely different shades of white, and that white has
<BR>
no real meaning. At this point, its obvious that white NO LONGER has any real
<BR>
meaning, because the nut jobs have used their propaganda to destroy the whole
<BR>
concept of white.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Two, you also assert &quot;the universal all-importance of symbolic reasoning&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Are you asserting that the universe  has an interest in this particular
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; value? (or perhaps you are in communication with other, more advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; civilizations, on the planet Xeroc who have unlocked the chemistry of the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; brain in advance of our limited efforts here on earth; -)
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, here we go again. I suppose you are one of the sort of people who think 
<BR>
that
<BR>
other intelligent species on other planets will develop mathematical 
<BR>
systems that
<BR>
make them unable to understand our math.
