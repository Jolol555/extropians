<P>Ron, my matter-world friends and I used to discuss science, philosophy,
<BR>
religion, technology, politics, all kindsa interesting stuff.  In the 90s
<BR>
they
<BR>
all [yes, all of them] invested in stocks and now they are rich.  They
<BR>
talk about nothing but economy and investing, stuff I know little about.
<BR>
<P>Please, is there a URL that explains the basics of M1, M2 etc, and the
<BR>
other buzzwords regarding investing and economies?  One that a rocket
<BR>
guy could understand?  Looks like I either learn their world or find
<BR>
new friends.
<BR>
<P>thanks!  spike
<BR>
<P>ps: As an interesting aside, one of my friends invested in some
<BR>
stocks for his daughter's college the day she was born.  He reasoned
<BR>
that college costs were growing about as fast as the market, so he put
<BR>
down the amount that would cover 4 yrs of Berzerkely tuition at that time.
<BR>
Reasoning that she had plenty of time for her money to recover from
<BR>
temporary setbacks, he put it all in rather agressive growth funds.
<BR>
Today she is not yet 7 yrs old and is well on her way to becoming a
<BR>
millionaire, looong before her freshman orientation.  {8^D  Is this not
<BR>
a crazy time in which we live?  spike
