<P>Hey cool!  Once in a very blue moon we get an opportunity to have a
<BR>
philosophical debate which has an actual test case unfolding before our
<BR>
eyes, so that we might all make predictions and see them fulfilled or
<BR>
demolished.
<BR>
<P>We have seen that Lockmart is providing traffic signal cameras to cities
<BR>
at no up front cost, only a cut of the fines collected.  Under those
<BR>
circumstances
<BR>
we will all likely agree on one immediate outcome: the traffic cams will
<BR>
sprout like daisies after a spring rain.
<BR>
<P>Then what will happen?
<BR>
<P>We all will likely agree that since the ability of the city government
<BR>
to catch red light runners has suddenly and dramatically increased, and the
<BR>
cost of each apprehension has decreased, then immediately the city's
<BR>
coffers will begin to fill with newfound lucre.
<BR>
<P>But then what will happen?
<BR>
<P>Zero Powers and I might argue that city governments will be forced to
<BR>
reduce the fine for red light running!  I predict this.
<BR>
<P>What do you predict?
<BR>
<P>Mike Lorrey might predict that someone will figure out a way to
<BR>
defeat the cams.  I agree this will likely happen, in fact I might
<BR>
participate in that activity.  It has been years since I have received
<BR>
a traffic fine, however I have been known to blow a stop sign
<BR>
at 80 kph, as can be testified by Jeff Davis who was with me
<BR>
last time I did so.  If the city put up an intersection cam I would
<BR>
be toast.  I would have fun figuring out how to defeat the thing.
<BR>
<P>Billy Brown might predict that the temptation by the city to
<BR>
become a miniature tyranny would be too much, and they
<BR>
would keep the fines the same as they were when it was
<BR>
difficult to bag scofflaws, or perhaps even increase the fines.
<BR>
<P>I predict that if the fines are not substantially reduced, enough
<BR>
people will get mad as hell, decide not to take it anymore
<BR>
and refuse en mass to pay up.
<BR>
<P>This test case is important, for it will be a foretaste of how future
<BR>
governments might be expected to behave in the future with
<BR>
increased surveillance abilities.
<BR>
<P>Everybody who is following this thread, think this over and post
<BR>
a prediction.  {8-]  spike
