<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;-So far, hundreds of topics are discussed in this mailing list, among the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;most important is obviously the concept of Singularity. I know there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;several possible paths to the singularity, such as stemming from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;creation of AI systems which then suppresses their creators. Or the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;singularity will be initiated by the human merging with the technology and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;evolve into greater than human intellects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;-What other possible paths are there? Which one do you think is the most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;likely outcome?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Personally, I think the most likely outcome is a convergence of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; independently developing technologies.  I don't know (obviously) which will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come to fruition first, but it is fairly obvious that once we have (1)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sufficiently workable nanotech, or (2) powerful and flexible AI, or (3)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extremely fast, small and powerful computers with extremely large storage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; capacity, the other two will follow shortly.  That, my friend, will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; called Singularity.  My own personal (unscientific) belief is that once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those three areas of technology are developed, they will, of their own
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;volition,&quot; converge on the internet (or its descendant) to turn the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; global/orbital communications network into a huge, semi-sentient, virtual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain.  I for one, can't wait!!
</EM><BR>
<P>My own opinion, as long time list members know, is that bio-electronic
<BR>
interface technologies, which are developing fast, will within ten years
<BR>
allow significant bandwidth communications between electronic systems
<BR>
and human minds. Current research shows that when such circuits are
<BR>
hooked up to neurons, humans percieve the additional capability not as
<BR>
something separate, but as part of their own mind, their own self
<BR>
awareness (see optical and auditory implants). I see this as excellent
<BR>
news. I beleive that as the technology develops, the first 'uploaded'
<BR>
persons will be those people who have lost large parts of their brains
<BR>
to accident or disease, and medical researchers augment their minds with
<BR>
electronics. Eventually one of these individuals will augment their
<BR>
minds sufficiently that when they die, the mind does not notice because
<BR>
so much of the mind is now on the artificial systems. This is what is
<BR>
called a 'soft' upload. Once this phenomenon happens, and becomes
<BR>
public, you will see a large percentage of the aging baby boomers
<BR>
clamoring to upload their minds so they don't die.
