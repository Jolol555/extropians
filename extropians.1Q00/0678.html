<P>More generally people should be aware of different types of computability
<BR>
systems, and the appropriate fit of problems to systems.
<BR>
<P>DNA based computing devices are excellent for graph based problems (Adleman
<BR>
demonstrated the travelling salesperson problem), as the problem class fits
<BR>
naturally to the characteristics of the environment (i.e. the reaction
<BR>
processes). Try a graph based minimisation problem on a classic
<BR>
(linear/harvard/algorithmic) computer, and it'll take several orders of
<BR>
magnitude more than it would take in a DNA based computer. Conversely, try
<BR>
undertaking a numerical calculation in a DNA solution!
<BR>
<P>You can extend this to quantum computing environments, and parallel systems,
<BR>
and so on. Even analog systems have their place in feedback control
<BR>
applications, as they perform faster and more accurately than digital
<BR>
systems. It follows a general principle of choosing the right vehicle for
<BR>
the right path.
<BR>
<P>It is a most interesting development to see these platforms emerge. There
<BR>
are many computing applications that can find time/space benefits by use of
<BR>
computing environments more suitably matched to the application class (e.g.
<BR>
optimisation processes in design and simulation systems). I can forsee,
<BR>
somewhere in the future, buying a VME type form factor DNA computing card,
<BR>
and beyond that, even smaller DNA &quot;daughterboards&quot; or chips. In the short
<BR>
term, there's a _lot_ of work to do to reach those targets.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps someone more versed in computability metrics, universal (turing),
<BR>
theoretical (graph, numerical, parallel) and realisable (dna, biological,
<BR>
silicon, etc) machines could shed more light into this area.
<BR>
<P>Matthew.
