<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I wrote about the Landis Tsiolkovsky Tower design paper in JBIS.

<EM>&gt; I htmlized it... See:

<EM>&gt; and pointers from that.  Geoffrey Landis is a very serious engineer, so...

<P>Robert, I got to the same point Landis did in my 1993 paper.  I will snail
<BR>
mail you a copy if you wish, or better yet, I will scan and email it.  I
<BR>
derived the formula for the cross sectional area in terms of altitude, then
<BR>
could not integrate, for the expression is quite complicated.  I did the
<BR>
same thing Landis did: numerical integration.  {8-[    I used excel for
<BR>
that purpose.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if anyone has managed to perform that integral and get a closed
<BR>
form solution for the mass of a skyhook in terms of specific strength of
<BR>
the material and the mass and rotation rate of the planet about which it
<BR>
orbits.  Have you heard of such a solution?  That paper was shortly before
<BR>
the web changed everything.
<BR>
<P>When I did my paper, I mentioned spider silk, but not diamond.  I didnt
<BR>
have a theoretical tensile strength of diamond.  Do you have that?  Also,
<BR>
I think someone mentioned a isosynchronous cable on Mars.  I concluded
<BR>
in 1993 that it is faaar more feasible there than on Earth.  spike
