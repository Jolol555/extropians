</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gave where cameras were everywhere and privacy was violated in a world of

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Institute and it's membership to fight for.

<P>Cameras *are* everywhere, John.  They are everywhere now.  Check
<BR>
it out next time you get cash from the machine.  Next time you go into any
<BR>
convenience store.  Next time you go into pretty much any store.  Next
<BR>
time you go visit the local elementary school.  The kids are totally accustomed
<BR>
to cameras, doesnt bother them one bit.  They know nothing else.
<BR>
<P>This camera thing is one example of where our beloved technology may
<BR>
have turned on us.  I dont know what to think on this.  As you know I
<BR>
have flip flopped several times on cameras.  But I am pretty much convinced
<BR>
that stopping them will be like fighting back waves at the seashore.  Cameras
<BR>
are tiny, they are cheap, people *will* use them.
<BR>
<P>There is a book that I am tempted to agree with, Transparent Society.  The
<BR>
author (forgot the name) argues that so long as everyone has access to it,
<BR>
ubiquitous surveillance is really an OK thing, .  Or if not, get over it,
<BR>
because
<BR>
its here anyway.  {8-|   spike
