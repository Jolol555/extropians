<P><EM>&gt; On the other hand - ethically, if i did a Suess rip-off, no matter how cute

<EM>&gt; and charming, *I* would feel like I was stealing, not to mention, unoriginal!!
</EM><BR>
<P>Nooooo!  If people wrote new material in Suessian style, the late author
<BR>
would be *honored* and his family would be proud, and everyone wins.
<BR>
We could do with more Suess-styled literature.  His last book, BTW is
<BR>
to come out today.  His widow says this is *the end* and is officially out
<BR>
of material.  {8-[
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'd love to publish a children's atheist/agnostic book though... someday,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sigh.... when I have time... yeah right!
</EM><BR>
<P>Queene if you were to do so, it might be the very most influential work
<BR>
one could do.  Consider the much loved children's book Go Dog Go.
<BR>
Of all things, this silly little volume has perhaps had more influence than
<BR>
any other, since it is aimed at the very young, 2-4 years.  Jillions of children
<BR>
have seen it, owned it, translated into dozens of languages, and the
<BR>
thing has practically no *memes* in it.  Well, does it?  And yet, how
<BR>
many of us had a copy of Go Dog Go?  Did you?  Do you still have it
<BR>
somewhere?  I have one.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>Nowthen, an old meme on this list was &quot;If one book, which and why?&quot;
<BR>
wherein I proposed that one interpret the intentionally-vague question any
<BR>
way one likes.  Several back then decided to post what they thought was
<BR>
the *influential* book, and since influence of a book decreases exponentially
<BR>
as one ages, then a strong candidate would be one of the first, and trust
<BR>
me, the bible is seldom one of the earliest books one tackles.
<BR>
<P>If we somehow managed to get a book with extropian memes, perhaps
<BR>
one that promoted free thinking, into competition with Dr. Suess, or
<BR>
Go Dog Go, then creating such a book might be the most important
<BR>
thing we could ever do to promote our vision of the future.  spike
