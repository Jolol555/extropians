Women over seventy five would rather be dead than be in a home with a hip
<BR>
fracture

<BR>
<P>This article seems pretty timely given the recent discussions on the lack of
<BR>
a mass desire to live for a good long time.  I think it's important to keep
<BR>
in mind that, for many of the elderly, aging really does lead to situations
<BR>
like this, and it is at least somewhat understandable if they don't relish
<BR>
the idea of immortality.  We will need to make some serious inroads against
<BR>
the debilitating effects of aging before we can expect much of the populace
<BR>
to start taking seriously, and ultimately supporting, the kinds of increases
<BR>
in life expectancy we're...well...expecting.
