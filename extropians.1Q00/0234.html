<P>
<EM>	&gt; Is there any actual historical evidence that JC even existed?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
While I don't know the answer, I have an idea for where one may learn
<BR>
the answer, if one has the time and the resources: From the
<BR>
singing-stories of the &quot;ashokhs.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Ashokh was the name given in Asia and the Balkan peninsula to the
<BR>
local bards, who composed, recited or sang poems, songs, legends,
<BR>
folk-tales, and other stories. These people have (had? I'm not sure if
<BR>
many/any exist any more) incredible memory and alert minds. They knew
<BR>
by heart many very lengthy narratives and poems, and they sang those
<BR>
narratives from memory. They also improvised, making up new verses
<BR>
that rhymed, on the fly. When these bards travelled from village to
<BR>
village, they would sometimes compete in contests that lasted weeks or
<BR>
months.
<BR>
<P>In the first chapter of the book: _Meetings with Remarkable Men_,
<BR>
G.I. Gurdjieff describes some of the stories that he remembers his
<BR>
father, an ashokh, singing to him while Gurdjieff was a boy.  One of
<BR>
the singing-tales was the legend of the &quot;Flood before the Flood&quot;,
<BR>
where the words are the following:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will tell thee, Gilgamesh,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of a mournful mystery of the Gods:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How once, having met together,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They resolved to flood the land of Shuruppak.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clear-eyed Ea, saying nothing to his father, Anu,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor to the Lord, the great Enlil,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor to the spreader of happiness, Nemuru,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor even to the underworld prince, Enua,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Called to him his son Ubara-Tut;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said to him: &quot;Build thyself a ship;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take with thee thy near ones,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what birds and beasts thou wilt;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Irrevocably have the Gods resolved
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To flood the land of Shuruppak.&quot;
<BR>
<P>When Gurdjieff was a little older, he read an article in a magazine
<BR>
that said that there had been found among the ruins of Babylon some
<BR>
tablets with inscriptions which scholars were certain were no less
<BR>
than four thousand years old. The magazine printed the inscriptions on
<BR>
the tablets and the deciphered text was the legend of the hero
<BR>
Gilgamesh.
<BR>
<P>Gurdjieff became excited when he read that, because he saw in the
<BR>
magazine-deciphered-text, the 21st song of the legend of the &quot;Flood
<BR>
before the Flood&quot;, and realized that this tale had been handed down by
<BR>
ashokhs from generation to generation for thousands of years, and had
<BR>
reached Gurdjieff's day almost unchanged.
<BR>
<P>I don't know what percentage of the songs were about factual events
<BR>
and people, and which were symbolic events/people that had been
<BR>
formulated in myths and legends, but I think that these ashokhs are a
<BR>
good place to start.
<BR>
<P>But I really don't know where one would find ashokhs today, if they
<BR>
even exist. Does anyone know if this singing tradition still exists in
<BR>
that part of the world?
<BR>

<BR>
<P>(..now back in Germany. Many thanks to those California extropians who
<BR>
showed me such warmth and generosity during my last month of travels.)
