<P>&lt;&lt; As I have my doubts about uploading and jacking and VR. I don't think
<BR>
&nbsp;that an uploaded mind alone can perceive sensory information as richly as 
<BR>
when
<BR>
&nbsp;it was wet ware. I have an open mind though and wouldn't presume to know 
<BR>
enough
<BR>
&nbsp;about the dreamed of methods and technologies of uploading to rule it out. I
<BR>
&nbsp;only wish to help with a unique perspective.  &gt;&gt;

<P><P>Hey James, thanks.  That is good info, I have thought about this &quot;wetware&quot; 
<BR>
information system dilemma a lot..  It's also good to know you a little.
<BR>
We're seeing more and more transhuman cyborgs these days... thank god
<BR>
<P>Good luck on your surgery!!!
