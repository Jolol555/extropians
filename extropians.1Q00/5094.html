<P>
Below is my letter to NPR, regarding the show tomorrow.
<BR>
<P>[snip - background info...]
<BR>
<P>Which comes to my first point - adopting the Joy &quot;go slow&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;stop&quot; perspective, is literally writing death sentences
<BR>
for millions of people.  It of the same moral class, in my
<BR>
opinion, as that of the Catholic Church and many others who
<BR>
ignored what the NAZI's were doing to the Jews in WWII.  We
<BR>
look back at those times now and believe that was inexcusable.
<BR>
Mr. Joy's position is incomplete unless he clearly justifies
<BR>
holding back what might be considered &quot;natural evolution&quot;
<BR>
for the sake of preserving the human species, while at the
<BR>
same time condemning many members of that species to
<BR>
unnecessary deaths.
<BR>
<P>This problem has raised its head in the recent debate on
<BR>
gene therapy.  The research problems that may be responsible
<BR>
for accidental deaths must be balanced against those individuals
<BR>
who are doomed to premature deaths, should the research not
<BR>
continue as quickly as possible.   The medical principle
<BR>
of &quot;First, do no harm&quot;, must be balanced against the problem
<BR>
of &quot;By not doing, you do a greater harm&quot;.  I would argue that
<BR>
the most fundamental right is that of seeking &quot;self-preservation&quot;.
<BR>
To conduct research and test products necessary to achieve
<BR>
that should be considered a natural extension of that right.
<BR>
I have little moral obligation to the human &quot;species&quot;. I do have
<BR>
a moral obligation to myself and indirectly thru emotional
<BR>
ties and commitments to those with whom I am close.
<BR>
<P>The perspective that we should slow or stop GNR research
<BR>
will lead people who believe that the research is necessary
<BR>
to simply do the research in other countries, or eventually
<BR>
on other planets.  You see this today as many German scientists
<BR>
who want to conduct genome research leaving the inhospitable
<BR>
climate in Germany for other European countries or the U.S.
<BR>
You cannot stop this train, you do want to constructively
<BR>
manage it.
<BR>
<P>Joy's fear of the loss of humanity, is an issue of timing.
<BR>
Humanity is ultimately doomed anyway, if not by an asteroid,
<BR>
then by the oceans evaporating, or by the sun becoming a
<BR>
red giant and incinerating the planet, or by a nearby passing
<BR>
brown dwarf pulling the Earth out of orbit, or the probability
<BR>
that, in the long run, all of the protons in the universe
<BR>
will decay.  He seems to be hoping that the &quot;end&quot; of &quot;humanity&quot;
<BR>
will not come in his lifetime.
<BR>
<P>His arguments have been proposed before.  In the mid-1970's
<BR>
the development of biotechnology raised concerns that the
<BR>
escape of engineered microorganisms could doom humanity.
<BR>
The solution to that was the Ansilomar conference, and the
<BR>
development of laboratory practices that have for the last
<BR>
20-25 years, demonstrated that these technologies can be
<BR>
handled safely.  The history with Iraq and the Gulf War
<BR>
show that, yes, when people threaten to use these technologies
<BR>
in aggressive, anti-humanitarian ways, that it may be necessary
<BR>
to exert extreme efforts correct those situations.  But
<BR>
the people that die in those corrective efforts are few
<BR>
compared to the numbers that will be saved by having
<BR>
the technologies available.  It is worth noting that the
<BR>
anti-genetic-engineering people rarely mention the millions
<BR>
of people a year who die from hunger and starvation, whose
<BR>
lives will eventually saved by more productive agriculture.
<BR>
<P>Mr. Joy may be unaware that the Senior Associates of the
<BR>
Foresight Institute do have a working document &quot;A Policy
<BR>
on Nanotechnology&quot;, in part, based on the Ansilomar principles.
<BR>
The first principle of that document is that you shall not
<BR>
release self-replicating nanaomachinery into an uncontrolled
<BR>
environment.  Until we have a much better understanding of the
<BR>
relative risks and can develop *very* reliable methods for failsafes
<BR>
and self-destructs, any uncontrolled release would be a foolhardy
<BR>
thing to do.  Rockets don't work all the time, but we seem to
<BR>
launch them with fairly high frequency to the benefit of mankind.
<BR>
Only occasionally do we have to destroy one and clean up a mess.
<BR>
<P>The technologies being developed *will* be complex, they may
<BR>
sometimes fail.  However, movements such as the Open Source
<BR>
Software initiatives, have shown how allowing greater numbers
<BR>
of human minds to look at designs and find their flaws should
<BR>
allow highly reliable systems to be engineered.  Committees,
<BR>
such as the NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee (RAC) (a panel
<BR>
of experts reviewing safety aspects of gene-engineering
<BR>
efforts) combined with things like Open Source seem to provide
<BR>
potential solutions for the potential problems Joy proposes.
<BR>
Ansilomar, RAC and Open Source offer an important counterpoints
<BR>
as how we should proceed.  They stand in contrast to the &quot;behind
<BR>
closed door&quot; development of nuclear weapons, used by Joy to
<BR>
argue that we must not proceed with GNR.
<BR>
<P>It is worth noting, that I'm editing this document using a
<BR>
computer program known as &quot;vi&quot;, developed by Bill Joy, almost
<BR>
25 years ago.  Its longevity seems to suggest that software,
<BR>
once debugged, is not as fragile as Joy's Wired article
<BR>
suggests.  Of course we must take prudent precautions to
<BR>
see GNR does not develop in the wrong way.  One nightmare
<BR>
that I fear, that is discussed a great deal by Extropians and
<BR>
Transhumanists is the possibility of an *amoral* artificially
<BR>
intelligent &quot;entity&quot; developing from self-replicating,
<BR>
self-evolving (artificial life) then proceeding to invent
<BR>
nanotechnology to suit its purposes.  Whether that possibility
<BR>
has a higher or lower probability than a near-earth asteroid
<BR>
hitting the planet in the next 20 years is an area where attention
<BR>
should be focused.  If that is however possible (after all nature
<BR>
has produced humans that are almost at that point), then we *will*
<BR>
need GNR to defend ourselves.
<BR>
<P>I have spent the last 8 years thinking almost exclusively about the
<BR>
problems posed by GNR.  Rather than be afraid of them, I believe that
<BR>
they offer an opportunity significantly greater than that promised by
<BR>
many of the religions of the world (&quot;Everlasting life in Heaven with God&quot;).
<BR>
The technologies being developed seem to allow the possibility for people
<BR>
to evolve into something greater than what nature has produced thus far,
<BR>
or, for those who prefer the human path, an indefinate healthy lifespan,
<BR>
until such time as a rare accident catches up with you or you choose to
<BR>
end your existence.  The exclusive Kurzweil/Moravec path (humans turn into
<BR>
Robots), or the exclusive Joy path (humans turn into pseudo-luddites
<BR>
and/or self-handicapped space explorers) are not an either-or-situation.
<BR>
There is enough matter and energy readily available for a Chinese-like
<BR>
&quot;one-solar-system&quot;, many &quot;species&quot; to evolve and coexist.
<BR>
For humanity to ignore or retreat from these opportunities, would
<BR>
in my opinion represent the definitive breaking of the human spirit.
<BR>
And that would truly doom us to a fate worse than those imagined
<BR>
by Bill Joy.
<BR>
<P>If you would like more background information on issues involved
<BR>
with lifespan extension, I have an essay on the net:
