<EM>&gt; THREE suns?

<P>Please. That's most scientifically likely bit of the
<BR>
movie. A trinary system is, at least theoretically
<BR>
possible, but it wouldn't likely be stable enough to
<BR>
develop a planet capable of sustaining life, or
<BR>
capturing a rock tht might bear dormant, hibernating
<BR>
life.
<BR>
<P>Given the right masses, a Lagrange like point of
<BR>
stability may exist between two of the stars, and one
<BR>
might well be a very large gas giant. What could be
<BR>
really interesting is the orbit our theoretical
<BR>
planetoid could take. It could full well wind up
<BR>
transiting *between* the three stars.
<BR>
<P>No, the most glaring flight from science in this movie
<BR>
is biological. These critters scour all the biomass
<BR>
from the planet, then go dormant, cicadalike for 22
<BR>
years, until it gets dark again (presumably they react
<BR>
to the temperature), when they arise and scour all the
<BR>
biomass from the planet once again. It might work if
<BR>
they were cannibalistic: the critters arise once night
<BR>
falls, the females find a suitable male in which to
<BR>
inject their eggs, the male, now mated returns to
<BR>
ground, while the female goes on to chow on however
<BR>
many of the other critters she can find, probably
<BR>
preferring other females, and hopefully preventing
<BR>
them from reproducing. In the next 22 years, some of
<BR>
the eggs hatch, and the young feast on each and their
<BR>
host while they grow, and the females grow new
<BR>
clutches of eggs. In such a cycle, they're not likely
<BR>
to recognise humans as food unless there's a really
<BR>
common basis for life.
<BR>
<P>A more likely environment would allow for the presence
<BR>
of plant life: the young hatch, feast on grasses and
<BR>
flowers and insects for 22 years, and the ones that
<BR>
have the seismic hearing gene proceed to go to ground
<BR>
and cocoon for the next 22 years when night falls,
<BR>
while their deaf brethren get eaten by their parents.
<BR>
22 years later, they come out of the cocoon when night
<BR>
falls, to mate and feed. Of course, once you have
<BR>
plant life, you have the possibility of a much more
<BR>
complicated ecosystem.
