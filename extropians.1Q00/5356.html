<P><EM>&gt; &gt; [Owen] Perhaps if we substitute for &quot;imperialism&quot; the word &quot;power&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; things might be less muddy.  After all, technically there are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;empires&quot;  in the world anywhere at this time.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now you’re talkin’!  I never really had a problem with the position that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US is too busy sticking its nose in where it doesn’t belong.  My only point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was that “imperialism” is an untrue and hyperbolic characterization of US
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foreign policy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Now, let's ask the question: can we assign actual centers of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;power (or control) geographic locations anymore? Does the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;power-grid, if any, &quot;float above ground&quot;? On the other hand,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I am currently reading Gregory Stock’s _Metaman_.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; <A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067170723X/qid=953451989/sr=1-2/104-2403997-4904450">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/067170723X/qid=953451989/sr=1-2/104-2403997-4904450</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Stock proposes that we humans are merely cellular constituents of a global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superorganism “Metaman” made up of the society of the developed world and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the technical infrastructure which supports it.  In this view there is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; real world power save that of the organism itself, and the various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governmental entities are but mere vital organs of this emerging global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; entity.  If this is a legitimate viewpoint, saying that the US is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imperialist is akin to saying that your heart or your liver is exercising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imperial authority over the rest of your body.  Whaddya think?
</EM><BR>
<P>I think, Zero, that you have expressed precisely, by means of your
<BR>
author's thesis, what I have concluded and pointed to the reason I
<BR>
used the phrase &quot;floating power grid&quot;.  As your author indicates, this
<BR>
floating grid is only &quot;docked&quot; at various location, which is becoming
<BR>
more and more a convenience rather than a necessity.  The verb
<BR>
&quot;anchored&quot; probably expresses the current phase of this relation of
<BR>
power to individual nations, while the process is leading to the
<BR>
&quot;docked&quot; concept, eventually perhaps to only an electronically net-
<BR>
worked connection that is more virtual than tangible.
<BR>
<P>I'm passing over your interesting comments on the relation of political
<BR>
freedom and global power except to say that bodies do get cancer
<BR>
and before metastasizing, it must being at a specific location. I only
<BR>
mention this because a county can be internally liberal but quite
<BR>
fascistic, totalitarian or exploitative in its treatment of other nations.
<BR>
Phoenicia was a case in point, as was to a degree Athens in the
<BR>
classic period -- Crete could also be cited.  Rome was I suppose
<BR>
a mix, but much more internally libertarian than most modern people
<BR>
believe -- in fact, they were remarkably tolerant of individualism
<BR>
as long as it did not create a problem for them that would sooner
<BR>
or later demand an expensive military solution.  Great Britain during
<BR>
its imperial period, while internally rather rigid as it is today. was
<BR>
highly dictatorial with respect to its colonies -- hence the good old
<BR>
U.S.A.  Today its relationship with Ireland provides another example.
<BR>
I'm sure you can think of many more.
