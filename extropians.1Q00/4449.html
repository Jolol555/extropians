<P>Tom replied:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It's a real business, Adam -- I wrote about the company in August of 99 --
</EM><BR>
<P>That it's a real business, I have no doubt.  The wonderful thing about
<BR>
all of these &quot;New Economy&quot; companies is that they are populated by smart
<BR>
people doing real things to change the way the world works.  And the
<BR>
potential stock market gains available for a successful endeavor
<BR>
incentivize the smartest people in the world to work on all kinds of new
<BR>
ideas.  It really is a great time in human history to be an entrepreneur.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and a $12 million investment is pretty modest.
</EM><BR>
<P>I can remember long long ago when $12 million was a lot of money, but
<BR>
you're right, in the &quot;Nasdaq 5000 World&quot; $12 million is now just &quot;Round A
<BR>
Money&quot;.  When an idea like AllAdvantage -- that's the company that pays
<BR>
you to surf the web -- can get $100 million from Softbank and others in
<BR>
Round C money, you realize just how much money is out there to be thrown
<BR>
at ideas nowadays.  It is at once amazing and obscene, but like I said,
<BR>
it does inspire the smartest people in the world to go out and try to do
<BR>
interesting and radical things. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And as for Portland, Me: The whole pont of doing REAL business on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Net is that it will happen in real places--Portland happens to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; key place for the fish business. (And Portland does have two big
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; semiconductor fabs.)  
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't knocking on Maine, we're indebted to the state for giving us LL
<BR>
Bean and Stephen King.
<BR>
<P>What I was knocking on was the fact that it USED to be easy to follow
<BR>
all of the startup activity in America -- it was pretty much centered in
<BR>
Silicon Valley and Boston.  Then, we added Seattle and Austin Texas to
<BR>
the map.  Now we have to keep track of activities in a dozen cities if
<BR>
we want to be &quot;up&quot; on what's going on.
<BR>
<P>We used to just have to read the New York Times and the Wall Street
<BR>
Journal.  Now we have to stay on top of The Industry Standard, Red
<BR>
Herring, Forbes, and about a dozen more niche newsletters.
<BR>
<P>I'm not lamenting the fact that the amount of stuff we need to keep
<BR>
track of is growing exponentially.  What I'm lamenting is that with this
<BR>
exponential growth of information, my productivity tools have gotten no
<BR>
better: I have nothing better for searching, filtering, and organizing
<BR>
information now than I had, say, in 1997.
<BR>
<P>One hobby I enjoy is watching CMGi (the company) because, as I said in
<BR>
an earlier post, they are always chasing whatever is hot.  CMGi of
<BR>
course had a conference call today and the feedback from it was
<BR>
illuminating.  Here's their long term plan:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?id=1080158007564000">http://boards.fool.com/Message.asp?id=1080158007564000</A>
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; From CMGi's conference call today:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Question: What are the top 3 priorities over 4-6 quarters and 2-3 years?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Answer: Top is to launch the 2 new businesses (a global web platform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company and a caching company) -- each of which promises to be as much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or greater value than current holdings 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  - Next is to move companies to profitability 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  - Next is acquisitions 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  - Next is organic growth 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  - Stay ahead in global perspective (investments, r&amp;d)
</EM><BR>
<P>Regarding the caching company, we know from his message board posts that
<BR>
CMGi's CEO David Wetherell has a lot ofrespect for Mirror Image and
<BR>
Akamai (in fact, CMGi owns a bunch of Akamai shares), so it seems
<BR>
intuitive that CMGi would want to start its own caching company.  [Also,
<BR>
from the press release: &quot;Akamai Technologies Inc.  will collaborate with
<BR>
CMGI on the development of new technologies to create and deliver
<BR>
dynamic content and applications. Additionally, CMGI and Akamai
<BR>
announced an increasing number of cooperative efforts to enhance the
<BR>
performance of company sites within the CMGI network.  CMGI-related
<BR>
companies currently partnering with Akamai include NaviSite, AltaVista,
<BR>
1stUp.com and NaviNet.&quot;]
<BR>
<P>I'm still not quite sure what CMGi means when it says it wants to build
<BR>
a &quot;global web operating system&quot;.  I posted CMGi's last comments on this
<BR>
matter a few weeks ago:
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Holy knockers, in that post (February 27) MicroStrategy was only an
<BR>
$11.5 billion company?!  As of its close today (March 9) MicroStrategy
<BR>
is now a $22 billion company.  That's a solid double, folks, in just
<BR>
two weeks.  Unbelievable.  [Meanwhile, the Strategy.com service that's
<BR>
piping junk to my Nextel phone has gotten this strange bug where it
<BR>
sometimes feeds me stock quotes that are negative...]
<BR>
<P>CMGi's a really interesting company to watch; three of its most recent
<BR>
spinoffs are Engage, Venator (was Chemdex), and NaviSite.  Each of them
<BR>
IPO'd in the middle of 1999 with market caps around $500 million apiece,
<BR>
if I recall correctly.  Now Engage is an $10 billion company (once it
<BR>
completes its acquisitions of Flycast and Adsmart), NaviSite is an $8
<BR>
billion company, and Venator is a $6 billion company.  And they're
<BR>
taking AltaVista public in early April, they claim.  Hmmm.  CMGi's stock
<BR>
price compared with its siblings is looking really low again...
<BR>
<P>Well, relatively speaking, at least.  But see, this gets back to the
<BR>
point Tom was making, that $12 million is pretty modest as an investment.
<BR>
In the &quot;Nasdaq 5000 World&quot;, $12 million *is* a modest investment, just
<BR>
like CMGi having a market cap of $39 billion &quot;looks&quot; low compared with
<BR>
the value of its public holdings (must be about $24 billion now and
<BR>
rising, especially with AltaVista IPOing around the corner...):

<P>But how can you NOT root for a company that just announced that its
<BR>
&quot;Internet Segment Revenues Grew 2251% Over Prior Year Second Quarter&quot;?
<BR>
<A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/000309/ma_cmgi_2.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/000309/ma_cmgi_2.html</A>
<BR>
<P>And heck, CMGi is already making good on their plans to &quot;go wireless&quot;.
<BR>
[From the press release: &quot;Since the quarter end, CMGI announced its
<BR>
participation in SoftNet Zone, a major initiative designed to bring
<BR>
mobile computing and Internet services, both wired and wireless, to
<BR>
business travelers worldwide. Under the agreement, CMGI and Compaq will
<BR>
provide funding, expertise and technology to SoftNet Zone, which will
<BR>
operate local area networks and computing business service centers
<BR>
throughout public facilities such as major airports, convention centers,
<BR>
and hotels. In addition, Nokia Corp. and Cisco Systems Inc. will provide
<BR>
technological and equipment support to SoftNet Zone.&quot;]
<BR>
<P>Okay, I admit it, CMGi-watching is a hobby is as productive as my
<BR>
hanging out on Napster all day.  That is to say, it FEELS productive,
<BR>
but at the end of the day I still have real work I need to do... :)
