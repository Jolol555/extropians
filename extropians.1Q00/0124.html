Hello from the year 2000!,
<BR>
<P>I didn't have access to the net over the holiday and so missed out and 
<BR>
responding to the online email celebration here!  I really enjoyed going 
<BR>
over the many posts which were introspective and joyful.

<EM>&gt;It came! We survived! And we flashed our joyous colors here and &gt;throughout 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the world. Round numbers aide, what a wonderful day, to &gt;see everyone 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;celebrating being alive.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Let's do our best to be around in another thousand years in some form &gt;to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;continue celebrating life, day by day.  Now it starts to get 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;*interesting*.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Merry Millennium.
</EM><BR>
<P>It is a mind-boggling thought that when the year 3000 gets here some of us, 
<BR>
in fact many of us, may still be around to share our thoughts and dreams.  
<BR>
The final line was the best, &quot;now it starts to get *interesting*.&quot;
<BR>
<P>I liked how Skye Howard put it...
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Hee hee... my hopes we'll all be seeing each other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;*next* millenium;) Whether uploaded, immortal, robotic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;or otherwise.
</EM><BR>
<P>It will make for quite a New Year's Eve party!  Every few hours Natasha will 
<BR>
be changing her form to outdo herself. :)
<BR>
<P>Though the new millennium does not start quite Yet (lol!) I feel the 
<BR>
excitement that has permeated our society.  And I have expanded my horizons 
<BR>
by being in the company of people such as the Extropians.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
