<EM>&gt; that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; rapid climate change followed by stable periods might be the rule.  (See

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Snowball Earth&quot; by Paul F. Hoffman and Daniel P. Schrag in _Scientific
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; American_ 2000 Jan for the former (now at

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; <A HREF="http://www.sciam.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html">http://www.sciam.com/2000/0100issue/0100hoffman.html</A>) and &quot;Rapid Climate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Change&quot; by Kendrick Taylor in _American Scientist_ 1999 July-August.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; is by no means like a highly elliptical orbiting planet scenario, say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Poul Anderson's _A Circus of Hells_, or the OnOff Star scenario in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Vernor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Vinge's _A Deepness in the Sky_, but it should give one pause.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Actually, the basis of the earth's deep freeze occilations were due to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the travels of the continents. With most continental areas on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; equator and periods of heavy vulcanism, such periods were a natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; consequence. During this period, antarctica was not at the south pole,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; so it was not sequestering 3/4+ of the ice on the planet. No land locked
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ice cap meant sea levels 200 meters higher than they are now. Higher
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pressure at the bottom of the ocean allowed greater sequestration of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; methane hydrates under the ocean floors, and thus less methane in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; atmosphere(methane is about 6x more effective as a greenhouse gas) The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; loss of methane causes a cooldown, increases in ocean ice caps, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; glacial buildup, the vulcanism of the newly spreading continents kept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the dust levels high. The CO2 concentrations and global climate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; temperature are linked only by a log relationship, such that CO2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; concentrations variances at low levels have wide impact on temperature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; fluctuations, but as concentrations increase, this effect falls off.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; According to my geologist cousin, essentially if we dropped the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; atmospheric CO2 levels by 50%, we'd drop global temps by 20-30 degrees,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; while if we increase them by 50% from the current levels, global temps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; will go up by less than 5 degrees.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; According to Drew, the antarctic ice cap (the large one, not the small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; one on the coast) is stable over the long term, and its been that way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; since the last major extinction/possible impact period of 22 million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; years ago. The winds flow outward from the cap (the catabatic winds),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and are replenished from cold upper atmospheric air that drops down from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; high altitudes (and the higher altitudes are cooling down while the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; surface levels of temperate climates is warming up.) The Greenland ice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; cap may collapse, and the arctic ice cap will most likely vanish in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; few decades. If the Greenland ice cap collapses, it will result in sea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; level rises of 3-9 meters at most. If only the arctic ice cap melts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; away, there will be little or no sea level changes, because that ice is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; already floating in the water. Any rise will simply be due to thermal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; expansion of the oceans.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael's point being?  I was merely trying to focus attention on some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recent work that shows the Earth's climate  is not as stable as some might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think.  The actual instabilities now being theorized are much greater than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was once thought.  E.g., the &quot;Snowball Earth&quot; scenario posits that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; oceans completely froze over to a depth of about a kilometer and surface
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temperatues of about -50 degrees C.  This is a much more drastic than former
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ice age scenarios.  (Of course, according Hoffman and Schrag to it did not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen all that often either.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>THe point being that so since such deep freezes are the apparent result
<BR>
of the positions of the continents with regard to the poles. Given such
<BR>
slow moving phenomena, I doubt that any intelligent species would be
<BR>
wiped out by such a change, they would see it coming from a long ways
<BR>
away. Given also the theories that planets need occasional catastrophes
<BR>
to keep spinning the genetic slot machine in order to come up cherries
<BR>
at least once (intelligence).
