Collision Course: Gold and Greenspan
<BR>
<P>By Reginald H. Howe
<BR>
www.GoldenSextant.com
<BR>
March 14, 2000
<BR>
<P>Alan Greenspan has not always had as much difficulty
<BR>
defining money and differentiating it from credit as he
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
did in his Humphrey-Hawkins testimony quoted in my
<BR>
prior commentary. In his 1966 essay &quot;Gold and Economic
<BR>
Freedom&quot; (reprinted in A. Rand, &quot;Capitalism: The
<BR>
Unknown Ideal&quot;), the future Fed chairman discussed the
<BR>
consequences of the Federal Reserve's decision in 1927
<BR>
to reduce interest rates in response to a mild U.S.
<BR>
contraction and continuing losses of British gold due
<BR>
to politically inspired lower rates in Britain:
<BR>
<P>The Fed succeeded: It stopped the gold loss, but it
<BR>
nearly destroyed the economies of the world in the
<BR>
process. The excess credit the Fed pumped into the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
economy spilled over into the stock market, triggering
<BR>
a fantastic speculative boom. Belatedly, the Fed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
attempted to sop up the excess reserves and finally
<BR>
succeeded in braking the boom. But it was too late; by
<BR>
1929 the speculative imbalances had become so
<BR>
overwhelming that the attempt precipitated a sharp
<BR>
retrenching and a consequent demoralizing of business
<BR>
confidence. As a result the American economy collapsed.
<BR>
Great Britain fared even worse, and rather than absorb
<BR>
the consequences of her previous folly, she abandoned
<BR>
the gold standard completely in 1931, tearing asunder
<BR>
what remained of the fabric of confidence and inducing
<BR>
a worldwide series of bank failures. The world plunged
<BR>
into the Great Depression of the 1930s.
<BR>
<P>Today the Fed's critics see wild speculation,
<BR>
particularly in the technology sector, where stock
<BR>
market valuations exceed all historic norms of
<BR>
rationality. But the Fed chairman is among the most
<BR>
influential propagandists for the so-called &quot;new&quot;
<BR>
economy. Cogent commentaries on the new economy by
<BR>
Veneroso Associates (www.venerosoassociates.com)
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
suggest not only that the new economy's claimed
<BR>
productivity increases are greatly exaggerated, but
<BR>
also that no one should be more aware of the shaky
<BR>
statistical foundations that underlie them than Alan
<BR>
Greenspan himself. (See &quot;The Myth of the Productivity
<BR>
Miracle: Part III,&quot; Sept. 20, 1999, pp. 2-3.) Indeed,
<BR>
the Fed chairman must know, the United States is the
<BR>
only major country that uses the hedonic price deflator
<BR>
to adjust its gross domestic product statistics for the
<BR>
increased power of computers. (See &quot;The Myth of the
<BR>
Productivity Miracle: Part II,&quot; Sept. 20, 1999, p. 7.)
<BR>
While the distortions of GDP resulting from this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
practice are difficult to quantify precisely, there can
<BR>
be no question but that the result is a significant
<BR>
overstatement of GDP relative to both historic
<BR>
experience and other nations.
<BR>
<P>Wide availability of high speed computer power has
<BR>
given birth to a huge business in financial
<BR>
derivatives. Indeed, the Black-Scholes option pricing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
formula in combination with dynamic or so-called
<BR>
&quot;delta&quot; hedging has revolutionized financial markets.
<BR>
Highly complex trading strategies based on these
<BR>
concepts produced the 1998 Long-Term Capital Management
<BR>
debacle (www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/stockmarket), which
<BR>
threatened the world payments system enough to scare
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
the Fed into three interest rate reductions when it
<BR>
should have been moving in the other direction.
<BR>
Nevertheless, both Greenspan and the secretary of the
<BR>
U.S. Treasury Department have portrayed financial
<BR>
derivatives as useful financial stabilizers not
<BR>
requiring further regulation by Congress. (See, among
<BR>
others, Statement of Board of Governors of the Federal
<BR>
Reserve System, House Banking Committee, March 25,
<BR>
1999, www.house.gov/banking/32599fed.htm.)
<BR>
<P>Black-Scholes and delta hedging require estimates of
<BR>
volatility based on historic experience and operate
<BR>
properly only in fully liquid markets. Whatever the
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
benefits of financial derivatives in normal markets,
<BR>
unexpected volatility or loss of market liquidity can
<BR>
raise havoc with them, leading not just to large losses
<BR>
but to market destabilizing events. Like LTCM, the
<BR>
problems of Ashanti, Cambior, and certain gold banks
<BR>
brought on by the Washington Agreement illustrate what
<BR>
can happen when financial derivatives crash on wrong
<BR>
assumptions or abnormal conditions. With his usual
<BR>
insight, John Hathaway gives an update on the gold
<BR>
banking situation in his most recent article,
<BR>
&quot;Apocalypse No&quot; (February 2000,
<BR>
www.tocqueville.com/brainstorms/brainstorm0057.shthm).
<BR>
<P>Similar incidents are possible in interest rate or
<BR>
stock market derivatives, particularly under the
<BR>
unusual conditions that could follow from the
<BR>
Treasury's bond repurchases or an unwinding of current
<BR>
egregious overvaluations in leading NASDAQ tech and net
<BR>
stocks. But far more frightening would be the
<BR>
consequences of a panic flight from the dollar on
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
almost all financial derivatives.
<BR>
<P>A statistical analysis of recent gold price movements
<BR>
provides further evidence of Anglo-American
<BR>
manipulation of the gold market. (See H. Clawar, &quot;A New
<BR>
Gold War?&quot; (March 13, 2000, www.gold-
<BR>
eagle.com/editorials_00/clawar031300.html). While
<BR>
Greenspan denies that the Fed is trying to control
<BR>
gold, he must know whether the United States and
<BR>
British treasury departments are actively involved in a
<BR>
coordinated scheme to cap the gold price. Indeed, the
<BR>
vehemence of the denial that Greenpsan made in a letter
<BR>
to U.S. Sen. Joseph I. Lieberman regarding possible Fed
<BR>
interference in the gold market suggests an effort to
<BR>
distance both the Fed and its chairman from an expected
<BR>
scandal over manipulation of the gold price.
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
<P>Yet as long as this manipulation takes place sub rosa,
<BR>
gold's usefulness as a monetary indicator is
<BR>
compromised. One result is unwarranted criticism of the
<BR>
Fed's efforts to restrain credit growth. See, among
<BR>
others, J. Wanniski, &quot;The Numeraire&quot; -- Supply-Side
<BR>
University: Spring Semester, Lesson 6, March 10, 2000
<BR>
(www.polyconomics.com/searchbase/03-10-00.html) (&quot;There
<BR>
can be no 'inflation' or 'deflation' with gold
<BR>
constant,&quot; and only a &quot;noodlehead&quot; would think
<BR>
otherwise.)
<BR>
<P>The Fed chairman acts as if the new economy is the
<BR>
productive miracle that its fans assert, that financial
<BR>
derivatives are the generally benign stabilizers that
<BR>
their promoters claim, and that the gold price is as
<BR>
sensitive as ever to monetary debasement. In the
<BR>
process he has put himself in the same position as his
<BR>
predecessors in 1927-29. Speculative imbalances, fed by
<BR>
grossly excessive credit creation and abetted by
<BR>
dubious financial hedging strategies, are allowed to
<BR>
grow. At the same time, the gold market -- with British
<BR>
connivance -- is rigged. But what is different this
<BR>
time is that the gold standard cannot be made the
<BR>
scapegoat for the Fed's errors.
<BR>
<P>Domestically, of course, the currency is no longer tied
<BR>
to gold. Going off gold was supposed to give the
<BR>
central bank greater flexibility in managing the
<BR>
nation's money supply. Instead, the result has been to
<BR>
undercut not just its ability to regulate money and
<BR>
credit but also the very foundation of the banking
<BR>
system itself. Banking depends on a workable
<BR>
distinction between money and credit. Without it, the
<BR>
Fed cannot control the growth of the broad monetary and
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
franchise separate and distinct from other financial
<BR>
intermediaries.
<BR>
<P>Money market funds buying commercial paper, government
<BR>
agencies like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securitizing
<BR>
loans, and brokerage firms making margin loans all act
<BR>
effectively to expand credit, but they do so outside
<BR>
the constraints of bank reserve and capital
<BR>
requirements. For an interesting discussion of this
<BR>
process and its effects on the monetary aggregates, see
<BR>
D. Noland, &quot;The Credit Bubble Bulletin -- Commercial
<BR>
Paper,&quot; March 10, 2000
<BR>
(www.prudentbear.com/markcomm/markcomm.htm).
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Banking
<BR>
based on gold is a demanding business that done
<BR>
properly is a public good; banking without gold is a
<BR>
crippled business that, however done, has heretofore
<BR>
always ended in an orgy of paper and national ruin.
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
<P>Internationally, the euro is poised to assume many if
<BR>
not all of the settlement functions that since 1971
<BR>
could be performed only by the dollar notwithstanding
<BR>
the breakdown of the Bretton Woods system. What is
<BR>
more, unless the European Central Bank and European
<BR>
Union nations lose their nerve, the days of the United
<BR>
States and Britain dictating international monetary
<BR>
arrangements are over. There is no practical bar today
<BR>
to the euro bloc's declaring full independence from the
<BR>
dollar by linking the euro to gold in some meaningful
<BR>
fashion. Indeed, a simple declaration that henceforth
<BR>
most of the EU's international monetary reserves will
<BR>
be held in gold rather than foreign currencies would
<BR>
likely have major adverse consequences for the dollar
<BR>
and the pound.
<BR>
<P>Nor is monetary confrontation with the euro the only
<BR>
possible nightmare scenario for the dollar. A problem
<BR>
for any world reserve currency is that major external
<BR>
holders of the currency have a potential weapon they
<BR>
can use against the reserve currency country. The
<BR>
importance of this weapon is magnified when the
<BR>
domestic financial structure of the reserve currency
<BR>
country is overextended or its external accounts are
<BR>
out of balance. Thus today, for example, any major
<BR>
confrontation between the United States and China over
<BR>
Taiwan would inevitably be complicated not only by
<BR>
questions about what China might do with its very
<BR>
substantial dollar reserves, but also by what other
<BR>
large holders of dollar reserves might do to counter
<BR>
any threat to the value of their holdings.
<BR>
<P>What was once known as the Great War became the First
<BR>
World War largely due to the unwillingness of Western
<BR>
democracies to face hard facts at domestic political
<BR>
cost. What Greenspan was able to call the Great
<BR>
Depression could well become the First World Depression
<BR>
for fundamentally similar reasons. Although another
<BR>
global depression would almost certainly knock the
<BR>
dollar from its reserve currency perch, it would mark
<BR>
not so much the end of a dollar-based financial world
<BR>
as the end of an illusion: that paper can replace gold
<BR>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<BR>
as permanent, international money.
<BR>
<P>Just as the Second World War forced a return to greater
<BR>
realism in the conduct of international relations, a
<BR>
Second World Depression should bring about restoration
<BR>
of a more normal gold-based international monetary
<BR>
system. But in this event, Greenspan, having set out to
<BR>
play Winston Churchill, is likely to end in the role of
<BR>
Neville Chamberlain -- the man run over by realities
<BR>
that he could not see or would not admit.
