<EM>&gt; You can't get 1,000 people to do that.  But in Berkeley every year, there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a pot smoke-in where a few dedicated activists pass out marijuana on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; middle of the campus.  Also, marijuana is smoked openly on the street and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the cops turn a blind eye; it's the law here that the police must place
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; marijuana law enforcement at the bottom of the priority list.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well on my recent visit to San Francisco, I remember I was getting out of a club
<BR>
<P>and people were offering me marijuana and other drugs, and police were there
<BR>
and they just turned a blind eye, I was scared that they would try to warn me
<BR>
not to be with these persons, or even search and arrest them, but they didn't
<BR>
even tho they know they had drugs with them, but they didn't even warn the
<BR>
&quot;dealers&quot; or anything, they were just staying there.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There was a big controversy over laws requiring the wearing of clothes a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years back; to my surprise, the city council passed or confirmed a law
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; forbidding nudity.  Groups of naked people regularly protested and to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; knowledge still do.  I don't think they ever got arrested but I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remember for sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>I heard that in San Francisco, some people still protests naked, and that before
<BR>
<P>people was seen naked regularly on parks and some other places, that you can
<BR>
still see some people, some times but it's getting rare now, any SF local that
<BR>
can
<BR>
confirm this?
