Ok thanks for sharing adolescent fantasies.  Ahem.  Ever read Stepford 
<BR>
wives?
<BR>
(Now if you can also program them to tell you you are the best lover in the 
<BR>
universe whether or not that's true....)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I am familiar with Stepford Wives.  I would not want that.
<BR>
<P>she continues:
<BR>
I HOPE TO GOD modifications will be adopted to make people *more* of an 
<BR>
individual and not bring even more soulless clones into existance. Fish eyes 
<BR>
and feathers, bring it on....
<BR>
But more bland female model types, and isipid GQ types and we can all
<BR>
...CONFORM!! CONFORM!!! More more : Monotony, tedium, banality.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I get tired of seeing nonconformists being so conforming to their 
<BR>
subcultures! lol  I understand what you mean, though.  I think Loree hit it 
<BR>
on the head with this comment.

Eventually, everyone will want a &quot;unique&quot; look.  Body mod designer
<BR>
houses will spring up to fill the gap... and like the fashion industry
<BR>
today, their biggest successes will come from commercial interpretations of 
<BR>
&quot;street&quot; fashions.
<BR>
<P>Perfect &quot;model&quot; looks will become the sign of a person who lacks taste
<BR>
or isn't able to afford the good stuff.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Commerciallism will of course want to cash in on any counterculture 
<BR>
movement.  I hope we don't end up like 18th century French nobility obsessed 
<BR>
with having the right look to please others and make their mark.
<BR>
<P>I think that a person who does not want anything to far out but simply a 
<BR>
very improved version of what nature gave them could be a mark of class, in 
<BR>
it's own way.  It would be interesting to see people who are products of 
<BR>
germline engineering who still don't like their looks.  But then how many of 
<BR>
us would agree with our parents view on what is goodlooking and how we 
<BR>
should look?
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
