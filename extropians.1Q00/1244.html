<P><EM>&gt; A few of you probably already know that sometime last year, there was a news

<EM>&gt; report that some form of faster than light travel was possible.  The source

<EM>&gt; material for the story was in some technical journal, but now the latest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; issue (January 2000) of _Scientific American_ has a lay level article on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subject.

<P>Daniel wanted some discussion on this...
<BR>
<P>First, S.A. with their annoying policies doesn't have the article online.
<BR>
See: <A HREF="http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0100issue/0100quicksummary.html">http://www.scientificamerican.com/2000/0100issue/0100quicksummary.html</A>
<BR>
Since I will not see that physical issue of  S.A. for a few more days,
<BR>
I can't comment on their article.
<BR>
<P>Second, I believe that the technical journals have pretty much ruled
<BR>
out FTL travel on the basis of time paradox.  The ability to go FTL
<BR>
also gives you the ability to go back in time and I believe that
<BR>
possibility has been strongly constrained by the physicists.
<BR>
<P>Finally, I believe the S.A. summary got it right with:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;...by harnessing the *elusive* force of negative energy...&quot;
<BR>
<P>They ought to have the &quot;We believe in Magic Physics&quot; warning
<BR>
in front of that article!
<BR>
<P>In response to Daniel's commentary on environmentalism &amp; government
<BR>
subsidies, I agree with much of what was said.  The problem we have
<BR>
in most circumstances is the discontinuities that would result in
<BR>
the radical shifts in the current system he seems to propose.
<BR>
The people who don't own homes, who want to buy them would scream
<BR>
fairly loudly if the cost of wood were to jump due to an elimination
<BR>
of the subsidies.  Looking at it another way, our taxes are going
<BR>
to decrease the cost of home buying or fresh fish.
<BR>
<P>Should it be that way?  Probably not.  The question becomes where
<BR>
to draw the line.  Should we eliminate the &quot;subsidies&quot; to the
<BR>
NIH and NSF as well, so private industry can take over those areas
<BR>
as well?  If I believed that would occur, I would argue for this
<BR>
but given the reality of current economic markets that focus on
<BR>
short term ROI, I would have to say that this would greatly slow
<BR>
down the rate of technological innovation.  Celera would *not* be
<BR>
in the position it is in today if the government hadn't invested
<BR>
millions of dollars in developing the technologies required to speed
<BR>
up DNA sequencing.
<BR>
<P>One thing is for sure, if the government didn't supprt physics research
<BR>
to the degree that they do, we wouldn't have as many clever people
<BR>
thinking about stuff like &quot;negative energy&quot;.
