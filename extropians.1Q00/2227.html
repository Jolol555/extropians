<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the 27'th update on my fly longevity experiments. Run #22
<BR>
investigated the effect on aging of the artichoke, and leucoselect
<BR>
grape extract supplements, which had reduced ethanol induced mortality
<BR>
in run  #21.  Also some supplements (eg sage) were retested, which had
<BR>
increased longevity in earlier experiments, that had not included citric
<BR>
acid to eliminate pathogen growth. I included blueberry juice as well,
<BR>
since this appears to have a potent brain antiaging effect in rodents.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No benefits on 50% survivals were found, a few supplements
<BR>
headed by artichoke extended maximum lifespan. This increased
<BR>
maximum survival to a surprising degree, from 62 days to 95 days. I
<BR>
can think of two possible explanations for this strange finding. Either
<BR>
artichoke genuinely slows fly aging, or it slows fly food deterioration.
<BR>
This second possibility exists due to the fact I do not change the fly
<BR>
food after a run is started. Although, protein, carbohydrates, and
<BR>
minerals may not deteriorate to a serious degree, in the absence
<BR>
of pathogen growth, vitamins are known to be unstable in solution.
<BR>
Thus it is probable that aged flies were suffering from vitamin
<BR>
deficiencies. If artichoke extract somehow helped prevent the
<BR>
deterioration of these vitamins, then this might account for the positive
<BR>
impact on maximum survival, without any advantage on 50% survival.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The results with sage were quite disappointing, and indicate that
<BR>
most of the longevity promoting effects of sage found in earlier
<BR>
experiments were due to an antipathogen effect. Thus these old experiments
<BR>
are of doubtful value.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally this run discovered a new phenomena, which I had never
<BR>
seen in any of my previous experiments. On the day 17 census the flies
<BR>
in  the prune juice bottle, showed almost complete absence of any movement.
<BR>
They were joined on the day 24 census by flies in the blueberry bottle. I
<BR>
usually had to examine the flies in these bottles under magnification to
<BR>
be determine whether they were dead or alive. I speculate their extremely
<BR>
low metabolic rate might be of some interest to cancer patients. Lowered
<BR>
body temperature is known to inhibit tumor growth. If high doses of these
<BR>
juices could lower the metabolic rate in humans, they might reduce body
<BR>
temperature, and thereby extend the lives of cancer patients.

<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The high early survival with vitamin E succinate was mildly interesting.
<BR>
So in run #23, I tested this on alcohol induced mortality. This proved to
<BR>
be a dud, and I am inclined to think the good initial result in run #22 was
<BR>
mere chance.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that once again leucoselect comes through with good results. A higher
<BR>
dosage of this proved to be optimal in retarding alcohol induced mortality, 
<BR>
than that found to be best for anti-aging in run #22. The higher free 
<BR>
radical generation in alcohol stressed flies may account for this.
