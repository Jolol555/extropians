<P>&lt;&lt; Stirling Westrup made some enlightened comments about how even the most 
<BR>
&nbsp;cruel and sadistic individuals in the future will be seen as &quot;sick&quot; and not 
<BR>
&nbsp;evil and worthy of severe punishments as in our day.  
<BR>
<P>Some of the Native American tribes have had that philosophy for eons. They 
<BR>
see people as being taken up by a &quot;dark wind&quot; -- where sometimes good people 
<BR>
do horrible things. Punishment is an odd topic anyway. What good it does, 
<BR>
what merits it has, of cost vs. effect ... of prevention vs. punitive damage, 
<BR>
etc., really!! ..it can be discussed Ad Nauseum by any group of Mensas any 
<BR>
day of the week without conclusive results.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;

<P>Within the culture they come from, gang and criminal activity may not only be 
<BR>
&quot;healthy&quot; it may be the only path to survival. We are not usually looking at 
<BR>
a Ted Bundy when we see murder. That is an aberration. The most common types 
<BR>
of crime are related to environment and poverty, as well as lack of family, 
<BR>
education and reasoning skills. *Bad upbringing, testosterone, macho cultural 
<BR>
memes, institutionalized racism, lack of opportunity, no skills and a wide 
<BR>
assortment of debasing, abusive domestic situations* usually cause the 
<BR>
&quot;mental aberrations&quot; that form most young criminals' mindset. 
<BR>
<P>Look: I doubt if neurosurgery will be available to them if they can't afford 
<BR>
a meal at MacDonalds any given day of the week.
<BR>
Especially if the rampant Libertarian politics espoused on this list are made 
<BR>
real. That would make one responsible for one's own medical bills. 
<BR>

<BR>
Leonard Cohen may be right  ( I've seen the future, brother, it is murder.)
<BR>
; - )
<BR>
&lt;&lt; In time they may become very mentally ill but they made the choice in a 
<BR>
&nbsp;healthy state of mind to go down that road.  I think with advanced neuronano 
<BR>
&nbsp;we will be able to look into brains/minds and see what the case is for each 
<BR>
&nbsp;person to give them a fair punishment.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;Should all criminals be seen as &quot;ill&quot; and be treated and not punished?  I am 
<BR>
&nbsp;not that enlightened yet and may never be, especially for crimes like murder 
<BR>
&nbsp;and rape.  Perhaps treatment and punishment can be fused together. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>Again .. just ask your local nerd discussion group, they can toss this around 
<BR>
for ever.
