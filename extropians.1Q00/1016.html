<P>
Genetic engineering would also tend to make most drug policy irrelevant.
<BR>
<P>Want to keep narcotics illegal, fine, someone could just splice in a few more 
<BR>
endorphin genes.
<BR>
<P>Want hallucinations, just adjust the ratios of some brain receptors.
<BR>
<P>Want some speed, just crank up epinephrine and norepinephrine in the brain.
<BR>
<P>It will be impossible to outlaw these since they already occur in the human 
<BR>
body.  All that could be done is regulate the levels at which you could set 
<BR>
receptors and/or production.  Or outlaw human genetic engineering 
<BR>
altogether...but of course it will be hard to contain biotech since it can be 
<BR>
very low profile.  And if the method of genetic engineering is elegant 
<BR>
enough, it might be impossible to prove that any changes had been made at all 
<BR>
(unless you want to require everyone have their genome recorded at birth).  
<BR>
Of course, genetic alterations which currently fall outside the human gene 
<BR>
pool would be detectable.  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bottom line, trying to outlaw and search for these kinds of mind 
<BR>
alterations would require a very invasive government, and I think for very 
<BR>
little return.  On the other hand, if we could master such internal mood 
<BR>
alteration (I think I hear echos of the Hedonistic Imperative in my head), it 
<BR>
might be wiser to make such activities legal and simply subject to 
<BR>
regulations for safety.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last thing.  When you add to genetic technology more nanotech that 
<BR>
might give anyone the ability to alter their genes at will...well, now you 
<BR>
might as well just admit it is coming.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, maybe that wasn't the last thing.  I just want to say that I 
<BR>
against the use of most illicit drugs at this time.  It seems to me that 
<BR>
using current pharmaceutical technology to try to alter the mind is like 
<BR>
using a sledgehammer to hammer a screw into a precision clock...its a really 
<BR>
bad idea unless you're desparate and that is all you have.  If you already 
<BR>
have a fairly healthy brain and functional mind, it seems like a poor 
<BR>
risk/benefit trade-off to try to use current tech to improve it.  That's why 
<BR>
I would by and large limit drug use to treating illness.  Now the above 
<BR>
mentioned future techniques of localized, endogenous changes to brain 
<BR>
chemistry will likely have the necessary level of finesse to try to upgrade 
<BR>
conscious mood and experience.  So for now, I recommend staying off drugs 
<BR>
unless you need them, and work on biotech and nanotech (or are they one in 
<BR>
the same&lt;g&gt;).
