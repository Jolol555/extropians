oh... I didn't get to see your web site:(.  Well, sad
<BR>
to hear that you're shutting it down anyways- so far,
<BR>
in my much shorter experience of the web in general, I
<BR>
have had a fairly pleasant experience- probably mainly
<BR>
because the guestbook on my page has only been working
<BR>
for a few days, from the sound of it, though:).  I
<BR>
hope your jadedness at least simmers itself out a
<BR>
little bit- there are &quot;good&quot; people on the web, but
<BR>
sometimes it does dehumanize things quite a bit.

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dear Extropes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am wondering how representative is the World Wide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Web of what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exists in the Real World? Do you think that the way
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behave in that medium is representative of their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior in real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life? I have participated in that &quot;experiment&quot; for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the last 5 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by providing a large Web site with very valuable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; content (so I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; told), and after these years, it's time for me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take a break from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Web for a while. I'm really cynical and jaded
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and disappointed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in what I've learned about people who use the Web,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so it's time to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stop, and be &quot;empty&quot;, in that Zen way. I reached a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saturation point, I think.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Today, I wiped my Web site clean. All 25 Mb and 300+
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; files. I didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give notice or put forwards on any of my pages, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I know that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few thousand people today (and every day for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; while) may be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little bit unhappy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of my largest disappointments with the Web, was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that folks who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visited and wrote me often didn't connect that there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is a real live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human being, with a real life on the other side of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those pages. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seldom were considerate or courteous. Since 90% of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the folks that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote me, wanted me to do something for them (help
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them with their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; homework, help them with their research project,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give them other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information, etc.), I would say that at least half
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't bother to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address me by my name (those of you who saw my site
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know that my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name was everywhere), or sign their own name, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even say &quot;please&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many people also mistakenly thought that, because my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Web pages were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there for their use, that _I_ was a free resource
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for them too. One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (college-age, I would say) person who wrote me a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; couple of years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago, bluntly told me: &quot;You should add compression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; links to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wavelet pages&quot;. When I wrote him back and said that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;if he pays me a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot of money, I will consider it&quot;, he sent me an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indignant letter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telling me how rude I was! I've also faced strangers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; calling me, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showing up at my door with their questions that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wanted me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer. I know that the proper response is: &quot;My
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hourly fee is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $XMegaBucks&quot;, perhaps we can discuss it then&quot;, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprised by their actions that I became flustered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and annoyed, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't think of a good response fast enough. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never thought that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks would have that audacity, yet they did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even when I made it quite clear in several texts at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my site that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't have the &quot;resources&quot; (time, money, my old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; repetitive strain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; injury limited my computer usage, etc.), I still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; received alot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; queries for my help. I suppose that those folks were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in too much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a rush to read that, or to care.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last year I put notice on some of my more active
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pages that I needed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donations to help me with costs, since I am living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a student
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stipend, and it was difficult to maintain the pages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100,000 or so visits since I added my notice, only 6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donated money (none from any of the very wealthy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporations that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know use my site). While I am very appreciative of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those 6 people's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donations, something seemed really wrong with this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since I considered my Web pages the &quot;shape&quot; I gave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; myself in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; World Wide Web, I always wondered what was &quot;enough&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give for my purposes, and what was &quot;too much&quot;. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phrase &quot;the map
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not the territory&quot; seems particularly apt. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; encountered some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situations where some people figured that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;knew&quot; Amara enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from my pages, and didn't need to ask me questions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and learn in real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life, who Amara was, and they proceeded to judge and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criticize.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In my opinion, those actions were laziness or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fear-based, but those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actions caused me quite a bit of grief, anyway. So I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; caution folks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about how many &quot;pointers&quot; to give about oneself on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their Web pages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if you are as &quot;open&quot; as I am, then maybe the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; World Wide Web is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wrong forum, or maybe you should just provide a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; minimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have to say that I really like how the Web enables
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people to meet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each other from far-away places, but I also wonder
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if this extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media layer promotes a less-than-honest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; representation of oneself. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confess that I have a soft spot for bright,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interesting people, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are offering me interesting conversational topics,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stories, poetry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gifts...:-) , if I have the time, or I'm in town,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read their messages, but I've encountered more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my share of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people (OK, men), who don't describe who they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accurately, or who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are unable to state what they want and need, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when I ask direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questions (and I am very direct). Several times I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found myself in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty painful situations because of that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dishonesty. (Sometimes, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that I'm too naive for the Web, or maybe even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world. That's why astronomy is a good field for me
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; :-))
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So while I hear about all of you transhumans &quot;moving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on up&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting your positions and places visible on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; World Wide Web,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here is one jaded extrope who is &quot;moving on out&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; taking a break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the Web for a while.
