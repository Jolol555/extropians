<P>
Neal Marin made me feel old(I'm 32) by writing:
<BR>
A pity...I've never liked either Oprah Winfrey or marshmallows. Perhaps my 
<BR>
history has been neglected in that I've never heard of the 'A-team'.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Never heard of the A Team television show!  The horrors! lol  I considered 
<BR>
this &quot;trash tv&quot; at it's best.  In this Glen A. Larsen production(the mark of 
<BR>
quality, lol), there is an army special forces team that are wrongly accused 
<BR>
of a crime and have to run to escape prison.  They are a nutty but fun bunch 
<BR>
who help people in trouble while just one step ahead of the military cops 
<BR>
who are after them.
<BR>
<P>It would always say in the beginning of each episode:
<BR>
&quot;Ten years ago a crack commando unit was sent to prison by a military court 
<BR>
for a crime they didn't commit. These men promptly escaped from a maximum 
<BR>
security stockade to the Los Angeles underground. Today, still wanted by the 
<BR>
government, they survive as soldiers of fortune. If you have a problem, if 
<BR>
no one else can help, and if you can find them, maybe you can hire the 
<BR>
A-Team.&quot;
<BR>
<P>There were four main characters.  Murdock (Dwight Schultz) was a tall, 
<BR>
skinny guy who was crazy but a gifted pilot.  The actor also is occasionally 
<BR>
on Star Trek as Ensign Barkley.  He was also the foil for..  B.A. Baracas!  
<BR>
This was the team tough guy and was played by Mr. T.  You do know who that 
<BR>
is(Rocky)??  B.A. had an irrational fear of flying and would have to be 
<BR>
knocked out to be flown.  Murdock was his foil on the show.  Face, was the 
<BR>
ladies man of the group.  He was also a natural born con man who could get 
<BR>
whatever the team needed.  Dirk Benedict played this role.  Starbuck, from 
<BR>
&quot;Battlestar Galactica?&quot;  Finally, the leader of the group is Hannibal 
<BR>
(played by George Peppard) who was a brilliant Colonal in Viet Nam and will 
<BR>
of course look death in the face and laugh.
<BR>
<P>In a typical episode some old man and his pretty daughter are being squeezed 
<BR>
by mobsters.  The A-Team find out and of course come to the rescue.  They go 
<BR>
nose to nose with the bad guys telling them to stop.  Then they come up with 
<BR>
a plan of action.  The bad guys then chase them into a warehouse or scapyard 
<BR>
where the A-Team holes up and miracuosly build out of junk a war wagon or 
<BR>
some other major weapon!  You would almost think they had nanotech at their 
<BR>
disposal!
<BR>
<P>During the battles, despite machine guns being fired at point blank range, 
<BR>
no one got seriously hurt.  As an A-Team member you could easily beat up a 
<BR>
guy twice your size by just grabbing him by the collar and lightly hitting 
<BR>
him once!  At some point in the episode Baracas would say to Hannibal, &quot;Got 
<BR>
to love that jazz!&quot;  The show ran from 1983 to 1987.  It was a guilty 
<BR>
pleasure but I did enjoy it.  There is talk of an A-Team reunion feature 
<BR>
film.
<BR>
<P>Well, now you are caught up on the A-Team!  I was reliving a little of my 
<BR>
early youth by telling you about the show.  It was corny but for me, fun 
<BR>
stuff.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
