<P>
I'm forwarding this here because we have occasionally had debates about
<BR>
the wisdom and morality of allowing people to &quot;own&quot; the airwaves.  This is
<BR>
a form of abstract property that is different from the tangible stuff you
<BR>
can hold in your hands, but not as elusive as intellectual propertly.
<BR>
<P>You can argue that you get efficient utilization of the frequency
<BR>
spectrum by allowing people to buy and sell it as they do for other forms
<BR>
of property.  On the other hand, why should a property decision made by
<BR>
people thousands of miles away affect whether I can make and operate a
<BR>
transmitter from my own back yard?

<EM>&gt; F.C.C. to Promote a Trading System to Sell Airwaves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By STEPHEN LABATON
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  WASHINGTON -- As the airwaves grow ever more congested with modern
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wireless communications, the federal government is developing plans to open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up the spectrum by, in effect, treating its frequencies as commodities to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be bought and sold as routinely as pork bellies or soybeans in the open
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Officials at the Federal Communications Commission say they are preparing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rules that would create a trading system in which telecommunications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies of all kinds, from old-fashioned radio stations and telephone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies to purveyors of wireless Internet services, could bid for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; underused slivers of the spectrum that are already under the control of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other companies.
