<P>Robin, I've looked at your page and unfortunately those sources don't
<BR>
seem to be in my library.  However, the strength of your opinion made
<BR>
me start reading through some of sources I do have, and is causing
<BR>
me to modify the &quot;standard opinion&quot; one gets in microbiology classes
<BR>
(which do of course tend to be oriented towards PreMeds).
<BR>
<P>Citing, John Cairns, MD (Harvard School of Public Health), from
<BR>
&quot;Matters of Life and Death&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&quot;It was aobut then, at the end of the eighteenth century or early in the
<BR>
nineteeth century, that life expectancy started to climb upward.  For
<BR>
those lucky enough not to be in large cities, life expectancy had been
<BR>
roughly forty for hundreds or even thousands of years (except, of course,
<BR>
in times of famine and pestilence).  Over the next 150 years, however,
<BR>
the industrial nations of the world were to see average life expectancy
<BR>
move up to 75 and beyond&quot;.  [p. 15]
<BR>
<P>&quot;The first half of the nineteenth century was therefore a time for
<BR>
assembling statistics, arguing about causes, and preparing for a reform
<BR>
in public health.
<BR>
&nbsp;The main causes of death were certain infectious diseases that the
<BR>
industrialized nations have now almost completely eradicated (table 1.2).&quot;
<BR>
[p. 22]
<BR>
<P>&quot;If therefore we look back over the history of this one disease (diphtheria),
<BR>
we would have to say it was largely conquered by prevention--first as part
<BR>
of the general reduction in mortality from many diseases at the end of the
<BR>
nineteenth centuury (perhaps because of improvements in nutrition),
<BR>
somewhat later as the result of direct efforts to restrict the spread of
<BR>
disease, and finally as the result of a specific program of immunization.
<BR>
Advances in the treatment of diphtheria (as opposed to its prevention),
<BR>
in particular the discovery of antibiotics, have had only a minor effect
<BR>
on mortality.&quot; [p. 29]
<BR>
<P>&quot;... we should remember that half of the reduction in mortality from
<BR>
diptheria had already been achieved before the technological solution
<BR>
was available.&quot;  [p. 31]
<BR>
<P>Based on Cairns comments, I would change my previous statement
<BR>
that modern longevity is due to: (1) Education; (2) Nutrition;
<BR>
(3) Sanitation; (4) Vaccines and (5) Antibiotics.  His discussions
<BR>
regarding the health and infant mortality rates in modern countries
<BR>
would seem to confirm that public knowledge (e.g. prenatal nutrition)
<BR>
and government health regulations (e.g. for clean drinking water) probably
<BR>
contribute much more to longevity than do medical practices.
<BR>
<P>However, when I originally cited antibiotics, I was mainly thinking of
<BR>
rural farmers having accidents that get infected and require antibiotic
<BR>
treatment (or alternatively vaccinations).  Of couse since more
<BR>
and more of the population is in the cities, this has a relatively
<BR>
low impact on the overall mortality rate.
<BR>
<P>But considering his Table 1.2:

<BR>
<P>I don't think you can discount sanitation and vaccines entirely.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Medicine overall seems to have very little effect on health.  This is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usual answer from statistical analyses, and from the few controlled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiments we have.  The mortality rates of most diseases treated by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antibiotics didn't change noticably upon the introduction of that treatment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I don't think we have controlled experiments regarding sanitation, but the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; statistical analyses we do have don't show any effect of sanitation on health.
</EM><BR>
<P>I attribute the reduction in Cholera deaths &amp; other food &amp; water borne
<BR>
diseases directly to sanitation.  Tuberculosis in large part seems to
<BR>
be due to a reduction in crowding in cities, generally higher economic
<BR>
levels (witness the increase in TB in Russia with the declining economic
<BR>
conditions), changes in building heating, etc. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd guess that Medicine of all forms probably contributes less than 1 year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to that 40 year increase in lifespan.
</EM><BR>
<P>If by medicine, you mean antibiotics, I would likely agree.  If you include
<BR>
vaccinations I think I would need some stronger evidence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since sanitation also doesn't seem that important, it is a big puzzle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; why exactly lifespan has increased so.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, we may &quot;split&quot; hairs as to exactly what we call sanitation.
<BR>
Cairns cites the availability of washable cotten clothes allowing
<BR>
people to actually bathe more frequently.
<BR>
<P>Sanitary practices (or medical knowledge) are also responsible for
<BR>
the huge reduction in female mortality following birth in the mid-late
<BR>
19th and early 20th centuries as physicians learned to wash their
<BR>
hands between deliveries.  It is certainly true that poor hygene
<BR>
by physicians and irrational practices such as blood-letting probably
<BR>
contributed to the high mortality rate in cities.
<BR>
<P>Nutrition (esp. the variety of foods available and/or refrigeration)
<BR>
may have also played important roles.  I can't believe that you get
<BR>
the MDR for vitamins or minerals (esp. Zn for the immune system) on
<BR>
a diet of potatoes in the winter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is also a puzzle why the US spends 14% of GDP on medicine.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cairns alludes to the # of doctors...
<BR>
<P>&quot;And market forces will lead to an overabundance of doctors, becuase
<BR>
there is almost no limit to the opportunities for lucrative medical
<BR>
practice in countries with a rich aging population.  (Incidentally,
<BR>
there does not seem to be much benefit in going above about 10 doctors
<BR>
per 10,000 population, because an extension of the analysis to other
<BR>
groups showed that no one, except possibly the very old, benefits
<BR>
from the presense of a large number of doctors.)
<BR>
<P>If this is true, the best thing the government could do is reduce
<BR>
subsidies to medical schools for educating physicians and increase
<BR>
support for &quot;bioengineering&quot; so we can make increased progress on
<BR>
designer organs, artificial genomes, etc. (those causes of death
<BR>
that standard medical practice will be unable to impact).
