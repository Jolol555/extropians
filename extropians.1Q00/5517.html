<P><EM>&gt;I wonder if, based on the totality of the FLIR tape, you might be able
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to answer some of the questions I raised after seeing the Rules of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Engagement video:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - All of the gunshots (assuming that is what they are) shown in the video
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   appear to be shooting from left to right.  This is the result of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   fact that the shooters are all on one side of the building, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the camera angle is approximately the same for all shots.  In the full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   video, are there flashes seen with a significantly different geometry?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   In particular, is the airplane ever at the opposite point in its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   circle above the building, or near that point, when a flash occurs?
</EM><BR>
<P><P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: The shots appear to be visible only from one
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;side of the building, which is because the primary 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;indicated sniper location is behind the building 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;when viewed from the other side -- I'm looking 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at the video now. From the visible side, the shots 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are visible across a range of angles to the left
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the indicated gun muzzles. I don't believe any 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shots are seen from the angle that would be viewing 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the guns from the rear. There are some flickering 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pixels, particularly in multi-generation copies, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the first few moments of viewing the tape I 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thought maybe that's what folks are talking about, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but when the shots happen, they are dramatically 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;distinct from noise, and they occur in the some 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spots on the ground even as the camera moves around. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It's clear the &quot;shots&quot; are something on the ground.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The question then is: are these flashes on the FLIR
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the reflections of sunlight off debris on the ground? 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was a big debate that the FBI abandoned not too 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long after it was decisively proven by Maurice Cox, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a retired IR-imagry analyst, that the flashes can't 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be sunlight reflections. His fairly simple analyses 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in &quot;The Sun Reflection Geometry Report&quot; show several 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(<A HREF="http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/B9-Report.htm">http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/B9-Report.htm</A>) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasons why the flashes cannot be sun reflections. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported one of those 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reasons as follows: &quot;Cox demonstrates in the film, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;using geometry, 'That the FLIR plane would have had 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to circle the compound at a speed of Mach 1.8 to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;capture reflections in the manner in which the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flashes appear on the tape.'&quot; That pertains to the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;necessity of reflective objects replicating the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rate at which the flashes flash, which is at a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rate roughly equal to 8 flashes per second, or 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;500 flashes per minute, which is consistent with 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gun-muzzle flashes from a machine gun and isn't
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consistent with any other identified phenomena.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here's a summary of the reasons why the sunlight-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflection theory for the Waco FLIR flashes fails:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/B3-NotPoss.htm">http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/B3-NotPoss.htm</A> 
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; - Are there other flashes which are less bright, so that it is harder to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   judge whether they are just part of the overall &quot;flickering&quot; of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   background, versus whether they are gunshots?  If the flashes are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   due to reflections we'd expect to see a full range of brightness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   from just barely above the background noise level up to the bright
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   flashes shown in the video.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Most flashes are consistent in brightness and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;appear to be shaped like gun-muzzle flashes are known 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;look on FLIR, albeit much smaller than this close-up
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;example: <A HREF="http://users.erols.com/igoddard/FLIRshot.jpg">http://users.erols.com/igoddard/FLIRshot.jpg</A> 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;All flashes reach full white, which is &quot;extremely hot.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;A few flashes are larger than the others and the claim 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is that those flashes may be ferret round or grenade shots.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt; - In the script at
</EM><BR>
<A HREF="http://www.mnsinc.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/burial/doc/wre_scr4.html">http://www.mnsinc.com/SkyWriter/WacoMuseum/burial/doc/wre_scr4.html</A>,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;   page 38, Allard says, &quot;These are embers that are flying off the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   building, but you can see up in here that this is rapid gunfire. When
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   we analyze the tape, we found out that there's two people there in this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   area here. And they're firing for about thirty seconds in this area
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   where we have the burning dining room area. And it's almost continuous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   gunfire. And toward the end of this particular section, we find out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   that the people doing the shooting are actually retreating away from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the fire and shooting as they're retreating.&quot;  He points with his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   hand to the left in the McNulty video to show the direction they are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   retreating.  Can you see this effect on your tape, so that the flashes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   are actually moving to the left as if the gunmen are retreating?  This
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   part is not shown in the McNulty video.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: I believe Allard's statement that the gunmen 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;are retreating is based on the fact that the gunman's 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;position appears to be further back as the fire starts 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and grows larger, but I don't see any shots that I've 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;noticed as occurring as such movements would be taking 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;place. Perhaps he's noticed a detail or two I haven't.
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;You are the only person I have had contact with who has actually seen the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;FLIR film so it would be interesting to get your take on these questions.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: The video, &quot;Waco: The Rules of Engagement&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is available in some video stores, like Blockbuster.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It shows some of the gun shots. It's regrettable 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that we all don't see this at the same time. I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;hope that those answers address your questions.
