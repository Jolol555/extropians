Yes... but the chip doesn't know anything about it's
<BR>
counterfactualness.  It *is* here-and-now, and to it,
<BR>
*you* are the future.  Perhaps consciousness is
<BR>
relative.  You could say that &quot;to itself&quot; or to
<BR>
anything else that coexisted with it in the same
<BR>
counterfactual universe that it &quot;is&quot; conscious... and
<BR>
that to you it isn't.  Just as, to a being (SI?) able
<BR>
to predict your every move and thought, you are just
<BR>
living the inevitable, and are therefore, to it,
<BR>
undergoing something equating a counterfactual
<BR>
existence... it's mind is already preparing for a
<BR>
reaction a few years down the road, and you are merely
<BR>
experiencing the here and now... the past, in a way,
<BR>
and so relatively counterfactualesque.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That last arguement seemed a bit shaky to me, but
<BR>
I think it doesn't necessarily mean that my main point
<BR>
is ill-spoken.  Perhaps one could consider
<BR>
consciousness to be relative to the observer.
