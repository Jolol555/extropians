<EM>&gt; It is really unfortunate that all the usable algorithms for digicash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a lock on them, in legalspace. Someone oughta rescue all these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poor bits, and bring them into circulation.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a few things going on which are at least somewhat encouraging.
<BR>
<P>DigiCash, which had all the original ecash patents based on work by David
<BR>
Chaum, went out of business last year.  But the patents have been bought
<BR>
by ecashtechnologies.com, and they are apparently trying to get a bank
<BR>
interested (still following the DigiCash model it seems).
<BR>
<P>One of Chaum's old students, Stefan Brands, developed some really fancy
<BR>
technology which could do ecash and some other neat stuff too and arguably
<BR>
evaded Chaum's patents.  Unfortunately he turned around and patented it
<BR>
all himself (having learned from the master, I guess).  However last
<BR>
week it was announced that cypherpunk company Zero Knowledge Systems
<BR>
had hired Brands and licensed his patents.  These seem to be good guys
<BR>
so I am hopeful they will do something beneficial with the technology.
<BR>
<P>A few years ago David Wagner, a really sharp guy, invented a way to do
<BR>
ecash that also arguably avoids Chaum's and Brands' patents.  And, being
<BR>
also a nice guy he did not patent it.  Ben Laurie has been working on an
<BR>
implementation of this called Lucre.  At this point he is looking for
<BR>
lawyers to give him a judgement on whether the technology does succeed
<BR>
in navigating around the patent barriers.  It looks very promising.
<BR>
<P>Somewhat surprisingly the market for person-to-person payments has
<BR>
suddenly sprung into being in the past year, centered around eBay,
<BR>
the online garage sale.  eBay has rolled out its own payment system as
<BR>
of yesterday, but the two main competing payment companies, x.com and
<BR>
paypal, said today that they would merge.  Presumably they hope that
<BR>
with a united front they can carve out a niche on eBay.
<BR>
<P>Whomever wins, once there is a widespread person to person payment
<BR>
infrastructure it should be possible to layer ecash on top of it.
<BR>
This might lead to a more decentralized solution which would be less of
<BR>
a target for regulators.
<BR>
<P>You'll notice that a lot of this has happened only in the last few weeks
<BR>
and even days.  It's very exciting to watch.
<BR>
<P>Hal
