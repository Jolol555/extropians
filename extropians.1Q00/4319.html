<EM>&gt; An internet based barter system would evade all of these bases:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) the internet (at least in the US) is completely private, the government owns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; none of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) the barter marketplace is a privately maintained entity that provides for its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own security and indemnification through encryption and insurance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; c) barter transactions will not use the fiat money issued by the federal reserve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or securities offered by the Treasury
</EM><BR>
<P>etc.
<BR>
<P>Despite these philosophical arguments, be aware that there are specific
<BR>
laws which apply to barter exchanges.  Some of us were looking into
<BR>
starting an Internet based barter service several years ago.  It turns
<BR>
out that barter services are well regulated entities.  The service must
<BR>
get the SSN of each participant and report transactions to the government,
<BR>
I think on a form 1099 or equivalent.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps by running the barter exchange in an offshore domain which
<BR>
does not collect income taxes, the server could avoid these regulations.
<BR>
Then it would be up to the individuals to voluntarily report their income,
<BR>
which in practice would be hard for the government to audit.
