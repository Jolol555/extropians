</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;By the way it would be interesting to know your opinion, and that of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the rest of the list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about us foreign policies, specially the ones that hurt the relation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between America and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it's neighbors or commercial partners. Specially how different it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;between us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and non us citizens.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well I tend to be one of those &quot;born on the 4th of July&quot; 
<BR>
proud-to-be-American types who is overall fairly pleased with US foreign 
<BR>
policy.  I mean when you think about it, US foreign policy is designed to be 
<BR>
palatable to the voting US public.  Actually doing right by citizens of 
<BR>
foreign states is really something of an afterthought as far as our 
<BR>
politicians are concerned.  As well, I suppose, it should be.
<BR>
<P>To the extent that any particular foreign policy &quot;hurts&quot; America's 
<BR>
relationships with its neighbors, it probably helps some influential 
<BR>
American special interest, if not the US general populace (which is less 
<BR>
likely).  And to be bluntly honest, while I whole-heartedly yearn for 
<BR>
universal prosperity, if my government has a choice between a policy which 
<BR>
is going to benefit Mexicans and one which is going to benefit Americans, I 
<BR>
want my government to choose the latter.
<BR>
<P>Your question (my opinion of US foreign policy) is almost unmanageably broad 
<BR>
since there is no single US foreign policy, but a whole collection of them 
<BR>
for different interests and different areas of the world.  But generally I'm 
<BR>
in favor of the US asserting the role of global cop where no other nation or 
<BR>
organization has the resources or political will to do so.  I'm also in 
<BR>
favor of US attempts to foster democracy and free market capitalism in the 
<BR>
world as I personally believe that would be a boon to everyone, particular 
<BR>
those freed from the confines of communism and totalitarianism.  As to 
<BR>
specific foreign policy issues such as GATT and NAFTA, I'm really not well 
<BR>
versed in them and haven't given them much thought.
<BR>
<P>Hope this helps.
<BR>
