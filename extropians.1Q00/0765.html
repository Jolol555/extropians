<EM>&gt; let them compete in the market of ideas and may the best method win.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyway I'll tell you one thing for sure, I'd much, much, rather have Bill Gates

<P>Well that last statement is quite obvious, and I would agree.  The problem is, we
<BR>
don't know that she or her cronies aren't writing it already.
<BR>
<P>So I would use Linux operating system and its host of GNU software, in fact I do,
<BR>
every day.  I also use Microsoft operating system software, and program
<BR>
applications for that machine, and as I hope that others can use it, the very large
<BR>
percentage of them using Windows, it is in my interests that this software works on
<BR>
Windows, and having paid good money for this copy of Windows that came bundled with
<BR>
this machine, I want to customize it to my specifications as a regular and &quot;power&quot;
<BR>
user of this computer, not some distanced user interface designer writing for some
<BR>
denominator, although I do like the interface.
<BR>
<P>That last statement was a run-on sentence.
<BR>
<P>Now about the government, nobody likes overregulation.  The ruling against
<BR>
Microsoft came as a result of lawsuits brought upon by the federal and more than a
<BR>
few representative state governments.  So, it came as result of a trial in court
<BR>
officiated under the rules of conduct of the land.  I feel quite comfortable that
<BR>
the defense lawyers were well funded and given adequate time to produce documents
<BR>
and edited video tapes, it's not my place to say if they were or not.  We Americans
<BR>
don't live in a completely socialist country, by the same token, it is not
<BR>
completely capitalist either.
<BR>
<P>So then, if the government is to take some action, which it would be bound to do
<BR>
upon ruling of antitrust violation sans rehabilitation, it should be to open it up
<BR>
and &quot;level the playing field&quot;, not split up the entity making all of the money off
<BR>
of it which would only engender confusion in the marketplace and 2^3 new ways to
<BR>
know their customers.
<BR>
<P>My opinion is unchanged, that pro-competition would be best served through casting
<BR>
light upon the workings of Microsoft software to the people that pay for it, not
<BR>
giving those people thrice the company to pay.
<BR>
<P>Why do I choose to forward this opinion?  No reason, but it is an honest opinion.
<BR>
<P>The responses to this post mostly show a general sense of antipathy towards the
<BR>
government and specifically regulation.  Regulation is good and bad.  The food
<BR>
producers are regulated somewhat, so that all packaged foods have a list of
<BR>
ingredients and rudimentary nutrition information.  Meat producers have some
<BR>
oversight, although the allowed conditions are disgusting, but would presumably be
<BR>
worse.  Drug producers have purity controls.  Advertising is supposedly truthful.
<BR>
<P>Then there is the bad part.  The government, as the organization to which we trust
<BR>
regulatory and enforcement privileges, will, like any organization with power,
<BR>
attempt to expand that sphere of influence as much as possible.  Our democracy was
<BR>
designed with checks and balances, yet the blight of bureaucracy still leaves us
<BR>
with problems.  So, it requires oversight and really pruning like an overgrown weed
<BR>
or kudzu.
<BR>
<P>So, in terms of the government, the problem appears to be that it regulates itself.
<BR>
<P>Back to this software issue, it may be misconstrued that I proffer the &quot;Open
<BR>
Source&quot; of Windows.  This is not so, specifically.  My opinion is that the people
<BR>
who pay to use this Windows to interoperate with the many others that use Windows
<BR>
have the right in cases to fully comprehend the functioning of this software, so
<BR>
that it inhibits them not.  I do not advocate that others should be able to
<BR>
redistribute this source code, although they should be able to make changes and
<BR>
share or sell those.  Microsoft would still be the only ones to regulate permanent
<BR>
changes to or sell their software.
<BR>
<P>Here's an interesting exercise, get the file format specification of Word 7 or Word
<BR>
2000.  Rhetorical, difficult.
<BR>
<P>Finally, about the government, the government deserves continual inspection and
<BR>
(in)validation.  As a beneficiary of approaching a third of the gross domestic
<BR>
product, in the most simple economic terms the government owes its people, who
<BR>
should feel secure in owning a part of it.
<BR>
<P>Back to more interesting technical issues.
