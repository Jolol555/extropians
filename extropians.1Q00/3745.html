Type II Error in the Bell Curve 
<BR>
<P>or
<BR>
<P>Racists, Damn Racists, and Charles Murray
<BR>
<P>by Jake Shannon
<BR>
<P>&quot;A null hypothesis is always one of status quo or no difference... A Type II
<BR>
error occurs if the null hypothesis Ho is not rejected when in fact it is
<BR>
false and should be rejected.&quot;
<BR>
(David Levine, 1998)
<BR>
<P>While thumbing through The Bell Curve, I found problems with surveying errors
<BR>
in the book. It is essential to examine the purpose of the survey, why it was
<BR>
conducted, and for whom. Technically speaking, there are four types of survey
<BR>
error (Groves, R. M., Survey Errors and Survey Costs, New York: Wiley, 1989):
<BR>
<P>1. coverage error- results from the exclusion of certain groups of subjects
<BR>
from this population listing so that they have no chance of being selected in
<BR>
the sample.
<BR>
<P>2. nonresponse error- results from the failure to collect data on all subjects
<BR>
in the sample.
<BR>
<P>3. sampling error- reflects the heterogeneity or &quot;chance differences&quot; from
<BR>
sample to sample based on the probability of subjects being selected in the
<BR>
particular samples.
<BR>
<P>4. measurement error- refers to inaccuracies in the recorded responses that
<BR>
occur because of a weakness in question wording, an interviewer's effect on
<BR>
the respondent, or the effort made by the respondent.
<BR>
<P>Murray and Hernnstein commit at least the first and fourth errors IMHO. The
<BR>
fact that they get a normal distribution when they sample a large group of
<BR>
subjects should be no surprise to anyone familiar with statistics. The problem
<BR>
is GIGO (garbage in, garbage out). I met Murray once while he was speaking in
<BR>
front of a decent sized libertarian audience at Laissez Faire Books where he
<BR>
caught a lot of flack.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This book is about differences in intellectual capacity among people and
<BR>
groups and what those differences mean for America’s future&quot;, so begins The
<BR>
Bell Curve. This benign looking sentence doesn't just have &quot;issues&quot;, it has an
<BR>
entire subscription. 
<BR>
<P>This sentence is correct until the first coordinating conjunction. It is
<BR>
obvious that intellectual capacity differs among individuals. Thomas Sowell’s
<BR>
intellectual capacity is very different from say, Pauly Shore’s intellectual
<BR>
capacity. What is not so obvious is the word sandwiched between &quot;and&quot;s in the
<BR>
aforementioned quote. The word &quot;groups&quot; makes Murray and Herrnstein’s premise
<BR>
guilty of the fallacy of composition. Is it true that if intellectual capacity
<BR>
among individuals varies, then intellectual capacity among groups of
<BR>
individuals must vary too? Of course not, it is not necessarily true that if
<BR>
something is true of the parts, then it is also true of the whole. (Dustin
<BR>
Hoffman and Warren Beatty are both good actors but did that make Ishtar a good
<BR>
movie?) Ask yourself, &quot;How are these groups determined? What is the
<BR>
differentia in defining who belongs to which group?&quot; Shoe size? Skin color?
<BR>
Baldness?
<BR>
<P>Are the East Asians superior to Europeans cognitively? Murray and Herrnstein
<BR>
say, &quot;[t]he universality of the contrast in nonverbal and verbal skills
<BR>
between East Asians and Europeans whites suggests, without quite proving,
<BR>
genetic roots.&quot; What business do they have to make such a claim without proof?
<BR>
None, it just shows that they have no qualms about parading arbitrary
<BR>
categories in order to justify political ends.
<BR>
<P>Sure, individuals differ cognitively, but do groups? No, a race cannot think,
<BR>
and if it cannot cognate how can it differ cognitively from other races?
<BR>
Murray and Herrnstein go so far as to rank races anyway with the help of
<BR>
psychometricians. According to them, ethnically the order from highest to
<BR>
lowest is Ashkenazi Jews, East Asians, Europeans, and African Americans.
<BR>
Female philosopher/novelist Ayn Rand said it best. &quot;The question of whether
<BR>
one alleges the superiority or the inferiority of any given race is
<BR>
irrelevant; racism has only one psychological root: the racist’s sense of his
<BR>
own inferiority.&quot;
<BR>
<P><P>With Liberty and Justice,
<BR>
