<EM>&gt;From: <A HREF="mailto:ronkean@juno.com?Subject=Re:%20Singularity%20information&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000212220214.17873.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">ronkean@juno.com</A>

<EM>&gt;It seems that the rate of development of technology would necessarily be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;limited by the rate at which the new technology can be assimilated by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;users, assuming that the users are directing the development.  So long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humans are in charge, it seems that they would not allow technology to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advance any faster than they wish it to advance.  And if humans were not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in charge, and technology were advancing on its own, as for example by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the actions of intelligent robots, it seems that humans would seek to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;isolate themselves from the new technology so long as it is too advanced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for them to use or to benefit from it.

<P>Two thoughts:
<BR>
<P>(1) Seems obvious to me that we humans have *always* wanted technology (at 
<BR>
least our own, as opposed to our enemies') to advance as fast as possible, 
<BR>
no holds barred.  Given the fact that, to us short-sighted humans, better 
<BR>
technology means more power, wealth and convenience there has hardly ever 
<BR>
been any resistance to technological advancement.  (Yeah I know about the 
<BR>
Luddites and the Amish, but what effect did either of those movements have 
<BR>
on the advance of technology?)  Thus, unless humanity suddenly changes its 
<BR>
tune, the rate of technological advance will proceed as fast as our 
<BR>
scientists and engineers can push it.
<BR>
<P>(2) Given that better technology has historically meant more prosperity with 
<BR>
less effort, I doubt that humanity will want to isolate itself from 
<BR>
intelligent robots.  Assuming the robots are (1) not hostile to us and (2) 
<BR>
willing to allot some of their prodigious resources to the care and feeding 
<BR>
of us humans, I think the majority of humans will be glad to live side by 
<BR>
side with them.  I think that even when technology is “too advanced for [us] 
<BR>
to use or to benefit from it” we will still be intellectually curious enough 
<BR>
to be interested in the dumb-downed summary explanations the robots will 
<BR>
give us of the progress they are making.  Given their intimate knowledge of 
<BR>
human intellect, I’m sure they’ll be able to explain it to us so that at 
<BR>
least are best scientific and technical minds can grasp it somewhat.  As for 
<BR>
the rest of us idiots, what difference will it make to us, all we will know 
<BR>
and care about is that we are free to do whatever we want in an open ended 
<BR>
world.  Who cares if we don’t understand it.  Personally, I don’t understand 
<BR>
the mechanics of jet technology, but its good enough for me that I know I 
<BR>
can fly to Europe in a matter of hours whenever I want to.  I may not 
<BR>
understand it, but I have no desire to isolate myself from it.
<BR>
<P>Your mileage, of course, may vary.
<BR>
