to think&quot;:&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Hmm. I'm a very deep thinker, in that I 'always' read 
<BR>
between the lines. My own mother hates me because I can 
<BR>
quote &quot;read her thoughts&quot; and bluntly tell her what she 
<BR>
really feels and means despite what she think she says or 
<BR>
wants me to think. She claims it's not fair, that she should 
<BR>
be free to lie to me whenever she wants. Words to me are 
<BR>
only references to thought, like a line in space. So the 
<BR>
point is I will read into every gesture and word for 
<BR>
interpretation of what I think is the real thought 
<BR>
(conscious or otherwise). 
<BR>
<P>With that thought descriptive profile of myself out of the 
<BR>
way (for future reference if wondering what's the validity) 
<BR>
here is how I linked &quot;I just figure I don't have enough data 
<BR>
to think further than the data&quot; to &quot;I like to be told what 
<BR>
to think&quot;:
<BR>
<P>&quot;I just figure I don't have enough data to think further 
<BR>
than the data.&quot; I associated 'the data' with 'known facts in 
<BR>
relation to what is being addressed'. I then thought of the 
<BR>
example case, &quot;What if I'm trying to explain a phenomena or 
<BR>
other unknown?&quot; The data I have is not enough to come to a 
<BR>
conclusion so I make an educated guess as to the data I 
<BR>
would need and to what properties it would contain.
<BR>
<P>You see, I thought beyond the data. If no one thought beyond 
<BR>
the data we wouldn't have useful scientific theories, using 
<BR>
the data we have to guess about data we don't have then 
<BR>
testing those guesses when/if the data is ever found or is 
<BR>
found for a different guess. People who do this think for 
<BR>
themselves, people who don't rely on others to think for 
<BR>
them.
<BR>
<P>Because you said &quot;I just figure I don't have enough data to 
<BR>
think further than the data,&quot; this implies you actually 
<BR>
don't think further than the data. (It implies because you 
<BR>
said you don't have enough info to think further, NOT 
<BR>
therefor you don't think further).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From this implied premise I concluded that sense you don't 
</EM><BR>
think beyond the data you must get data from somewhere, 
<BR>
which means you must get it from people who tell you.
<BR>
<P>Note: This does not mean you couldn't stumble across the 
<BR>
data, but it does mean you couldn't look for the data. You 
<BR>
couldn't look for the data because you don't know what 
<BR>
you're looking for (which means you couldn't make the valid 
<BR>
association needed for a correct conclusion), and you 
<BR>
couldn't know what you're looking for because you don't know 
<BR>
the properties of the data for which you would have thought 
<BR>
of if you thought beyond the original data.
<BR>
<P>I made the association from 'I' to 'we' because 'we as a 
<BR>
group' usually discuss ways of living and philosophies to 
<BR>
hold which work for us and the whole reason for sharing such 
<BR>
issues is for others to adopt them.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, so there it is. I wasn't trying to be rude (which 
<BR>
I'm sure you already know) just looking for confirmation or 
<BR>
clarity, which is why it was the form of a question  not a 
<BR>
statement. I don't butter up my statements or clarify my 
<BR>
thoughts too often because it would take hours sometimes. 
<BR>
For example this writing took over 20 minutes and I made and 
<BR>
understood the associations in a half second. I think most 
<BR>
people do this though which makes for speedier discussions, 
<BR>
but I don't mind clarifying things, when people have no clue 
<BR>
what I'm talking about or what my point is, etc.. as long as 
<BR>
they're first reading between my lines. Thanks.
