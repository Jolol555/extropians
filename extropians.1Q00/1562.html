Seriously though, for years I've always wondered if there was an institution 
<BR>
for dedicating your life to science/reasoning. Like the religious 
<BR>
monasteries, a placeto eat/sleep and breath scientific research. Any one 
<BR>
know of any such institutions/groups? Or anyone share my thoughts?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>M.I.T. or Caltech are what come to mind for me!  If you are a professor who 
<BR>
lives in on-campus housing then you would be that much more immersed in the 
<BR>
academic environment.  I realize you are visualizing something more intense 
<BR>
and enclosed and so the monastery
<BR>
model is a good one.
<BR>
<P>I would think that a researcher would need down time so a scientific 
<BR>
research &quot;monastery&quot; might create burnout.  Like with other endeavors, 
<BR>
doesn't the researcher need outside interests and activities (sports, 
<BR>
cultural events, family) to spark or replenish the intellectual and creative 
<BR>
batteries?  Or for the dedicated researcher are those all just diversions or 
<BR>
even obstructions to their progress?
<BR>
