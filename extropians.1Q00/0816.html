<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  The Gulf is a nice place to put
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;  an island.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; ... commented on the problems of building within Exclusive Economic 
</EM><BR>
Zones..
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Ok, Greg, I'll bite on this one.  Is there an instance of an oil platform
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  in the world that is not within an EEZ?  
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know if there's a PLATFORM outside of any country's EEZ (I doubt it, 
<BR>
since the continental shelf is by and large within 200 miles of a coastline), 
<BR>
but there IS drilling activity in &quot;true&quot; international waters - it's just 
<BR>
done on floating structures (semi-submersible rigs and drillships - which, 
<BR>
BTW, is wickedly cool technology).
<BR>
<P>Some clarifying points: Under UNCLOS, the &quot;territorial sea&quot; extends to 12 
<BR>
miles beyond the coastline.  The contiguous coastal state has true 
<BR>
sovereignty in all aspects of that area (in, on, under, etc. the water, 
<BR>
airspace and seafloor).  The coastal state may regulate all aspects of 
<BR>
transit through or other operation within the territorial sea.  
<BR>
<P>The EEZ extends from 12 to 200 miles offshore.  The WATERS of the EEZ are 
<BR>
&quot;international&quot;, but the coastal state has the exclusive right 1) to reap the 
<BR>
economic benefits from those waters and the underlying seafloor and 2) to 
<BR>
regulate certain activity within the EEZ (such as scientific or 
<BR>
resource-exploratory activity), but NOT to exclude &quot;innocent passage&quot; through 
<BR>
the EEZ (thus, the famous Lybian/US &quot;Line of Death&quot; confrontation in the Gulf 
<BR>
of Sidra in the early 1980s - which also concerned the arcana of defining 
<BR>
when a Gulf is so enclosed by the land of the coastal state as to become 
<BR>
territorial waters - a bit of nit-picking that also bears on such bodies as 
<BR>
the Gulf of California).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  If so, who owns it, what legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  jurisdiction does it fall under and were the corporations clever enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to create some offshore subsidiary as the owner to shelter any income
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  it might generate?
</EM><BR>
<P>UNCLOS defines a FIXED &quot;artificial&quot; platform in the EEZ as being &quot;territory&quot; 
<BR>
of the coastal state (although not for purposes of defining coastline - only 
<BR>
&quot;natural&quot; islands do that).  A fixed platform is not &quot;flagged&quot; for purposes 
<BR>
of application of law, but rather is considered native territory.  Vessels 
<BR>
and movable, &quot;unfixed&quot; structures are subject to &quot;flag&quot; law.  Thus, for 
<BR>
instance, a US-flagged semi-submersible operating in Mexico's EEZ is subject 
<BR>
to US 'flag&quot; law regarding non-economic activity aboard the vessel, but its 
<BR>
economic activity of extracting hydrocarbons is (or may permissibly be) 
<BR>
subject to Mexican law to the limits allowed under UNCLOS.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; I believe that slice is in pretty deep water ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  So what?  With bio/nanotech you are better off building a floating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  island anyway.   This of course segues into a fundamental question of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  when does the oil platform you are towing around become an &quot;independent&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  land mass?  Do you simply have to tie it down to the bottom or do you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  need to convert some large fraction of the material below it into coral?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yow!  You're asking some tough questions.  Much of the jurisdictional and 
<BR>
&quot;choice-of-law&quot; jurisprudence of admiralty law turns on whether the subject 
<BR>
is a &quot;vessel&quot; or not.  As far as I know, things are considered either 
<BR>
&quot;vessels&quot; or &quot;platforms&quot;; I know of no case where a court couldn't make the 
<BR>
determination eventually.  To the untrained eye, a drillship is clearly a 
<BR>
vessel (it has a pointy end and a round end) and a fixed platform is clearly 
<BR>
that (stout legs that extend down to the seafloor and are more or less 
<BR>
permanently attached to the bottom and the structure at the top).  &quot;Jack-up&quot; 
<BR>
rigs and semi-submersibles may look like hard questions to laymen, but in 
<BR>
fact the principles of admiralty law lead to rational and logical answers 
<BR>
fairly quickly.  Both are considered vessels (even though they may not have 
<BR>
their own motive power - although they almost always have really cool 
<BR>
swiveling positional thrusters).
<BR>
<P>A &quot;grown&quot; island that is held in position like a semi-submersible (i.e. with 
<BR>
anchor lines held taught by counter-buoyancy) will be a TOUGH question.  
<BR>
While the physics are the same as a semi's, the INTENT is clearly to leave 
<BR>
the structure in place indefinitely (which is definitely NOT the case with 
<BR>
semis - one of the determining factors in the cases which decided their 
<BR>
&quot;vessel&quot; status).  I could certainly make arguments on both sides of the 
<BR>
question.  Perhaps we shouldn't say more in a public forum until we figure 
<BR>
out which characterization best suits our needs :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I guess this is related to the question of -- if a volcanic island
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  arises in international waters -- who gets to own/claim it?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure, but I think this hasn't come up in modern times.  I recall a 
<BR>
new piece of territory arising in the North Atlantic (near Iceland?) within 
<BR>
the last 30 years . . . but I think it may have been within a coastal state's 
<BR>
territorial sea - not even pressing the EEZ line (and also before the 
<BR>
adoption of UNCLOS - which was an era of governed primarily by international 
<BR>
customary law insofar as such questions were concerned)
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  We need to get started now on slipping into some UN treaty some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  wording that &quot;islands&quot; grown in international waters are recognized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  as independent nation-states when the following criteria are met ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Having researched the history of UNCLOS' drafting and adoption in 
<BR>
excruciating detail many years ago (and having gotten to know one of it's 
<BR>
primary draftsman), all I can say to this suggestion is &quot;good luck&quot;!  The 
<BR>
process makes the typical NATIONAL legislative process look swift, efficient 
<BR>
and transparent . . .
