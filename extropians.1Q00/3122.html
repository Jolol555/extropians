<P><EM>&gt; Before I signed up with Alcor I did some fairly thorough due dilligence and

<EM>&gt; involvement with Alcor versus other uses of the money.  I concluded that 1)

<EM>&gt; the people involved with Alcor had put a lot of thought into making a small,

<EM>&gt; non-profit organization as sustainable as possible, even if the idea never

<EM>&gt; &quot;catches on&quot; and 2) that the relative value of the investment in a cryonics

<P>This is all understood, however someone my age (32) with no health risks is not
<BR>
likely to die anytime in the near future in a manner that is likely to leave the
<BR>
brain in any condition to be worth preserving. This is IMHO the main reason why
<BR>
cryonic suspension does not gain more adherents, combined with the perception by
<BR>
the public that even if you are preserved and revived that you will be revived as
<BR>
an old person, not as a young person. Others I have talked to have said that they
<BR>
couldn't imagine being considered sane by a future society when they are revived,
<BR>
due to their current attitudes as well as due to pure culture shock. I don't buy
<BR>
those excuses, except for my first one, and I'm leaning toward getting a
<BR>
suspension deal set up.
