Note:
<BR>
<P>Wired magazine and Wired News aren't related anymore. Wired News was 
<BR>
purchased by Lycos a while ago; Wired magazine is now owned by Conde 
<BR>
Nast.
<BR>
<P>I mention it because Wired magazine would not publish an article 
<BR>
touting homeopathy.

Executive Editor, Wired
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Wired has an article this morning about a supposed scientific theory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;explaining why and how homeopathic medicines could work.  I have done
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;some web research though and found an even more interesting story behind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the story.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,33749,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/technology/0,1282,33749,00.html</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;In homeopathy, materials are diluted repeatedly, to an astronomical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;degree.  One drop of solution is mixed with 99 drops of pure water and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shaken to form a more dilute solution.  This may be repeated dozens of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;times, until statistically there is no chance that even a single molecule
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the original remains (unless it stuck to the glass, I suppose).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Homeopaths say that the MORE diluted it gets, the STRONGER it gets,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exactly the opposite of conventional medical reasoning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Wired writes, quoting a homeopath's book:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Validation of the dilution process came in a roundabout way, thanks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    to research by California Institute of Technology chemistry professor
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Shui Yin Lo, who was performing experiments on how to improve car
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    engine efficiency.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Lo found that water molecules, which are random in their normal state,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    begin to form a cluster when a substance is added to water and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    water is vigorously shaken -- the exact process homeopaths use to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    create their medicine.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Lo said every substance exerts its own unique influence on the water,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    so each cluster shape and configuration is unique to the substance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    added. With each dilution and shaking, the clusters grow bigger and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    stronger. This water, which homeopaths call &quot;potentized,&quot; is considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    &quot;structured water,&quot; because the water molecules have taken on a shape
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    influenced by the original substance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The clusters start to assume a form that mimics the structure of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    original substance itself. So even though the chemical can no longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    be detected, its &quot;image&quot; is there, taken on by the water molecules.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This would be remarkable if true.  Now for the really interesting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;part.  I found a web page devoted to debunking these claims,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/ATG/">http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/ATG/</A>.  It seems that Dr. Lo, presently a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;visiting professor at Caltech, is Director of R&amp;D at a company called ATG
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which is exploiting his technology with some very questionable products,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;including an additive for your air filter that will improve your car's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;performance, and the &quot;Laundry Ball&quot; which will clean your clothes without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;detergent (both of these products have been forced off the market as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fraudulent in some states).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Lo's research has been described as involving the discovery of &quot;room
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;temperature ice&quot; (shades of Kurt Vonnegut!).  A press release from ATG
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;from the site above reads:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    A Unique Non-Melting Ice Crystal Found in Room Temperature Water:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Significant Implications for Medicine, Manufacturing, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Environment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    New research by a group of California scientists at the American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Technologies Group have discovered, identified, and characterized a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    unique type of stable (non-melting) ice crystals that maintain an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    electrical field. These scientists and several leading university
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    professors are finding significant applications of these unique ice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    crystals in medicine and pharmacy, in combustion enhancement, and in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    surfactants and cleansing agents.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Specifically, they have been found to increase significantly the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    antibody and cell-mediated immune responses to infection and cancer.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    They have been found to improve gas combustion and reduce pollution
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    emissions. They have also been found to improve significantly the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    efficacy of large industrial furnaces used to make ingredients for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the manufacture of plastics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    Shui-Yin Lo, PhD, a visiting professor at the California Institute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of Technology and an internationally respected theoretical physicist,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    has led a team of scientists to confirm the existence and significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    of the ice crystals and their electrical fields.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    The existence of these ice crystals has been verified with photographs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    from an electron microscope, providing two-dimension al pictures of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    the ice crystals, and the newly developed Atomic force microscope
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    which provides three-dimensional photographs of the crystals. Dr. Lo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    calls these ice crystals, IE crystals (&quot;I&quot; stands for ice, and &quot;E&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    for the electrical field that is emanated from them). The IE crystals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    look a bit like a lentil bean and have a flat disc configuration. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    crystals congregate into clusters that range from 15nm to several
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    microns in size and can even be seen with a light micrscope using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    high power magnification.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Read the site for more surprises: the Scientology connection, a possible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stock scam, board members who were involved with another scam company,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and other miraculous technologies coming soon from ATG (including the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;health products hinted at above).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Oh, it also turns out that Lo got into the dilution research with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;specific intention of copying homeopathic procedures.  He didn't just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stumble into it as the Wired article implies.
