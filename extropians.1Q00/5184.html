<EM>&gt; I eagerly read &quot;Engines of Creation&quot;...and the sequel...as well as &quot;mambo 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chicken&quot; and anything else i could find on MNT....I haven't seen anything 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lately....why not?
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a couple of books on my Reading List page, and I'm sure
<BR>
you are aware of most of the authors discussed on the list - Bear,
<BR>
Stephenson, etc.  Robert Freitas is going to write a popularization
<BR>
of Nanomedicine that I expect will be very cool, but he has to finish
<BR>
the other two technical volumes first.  There are an increasing number
<BR>
of academic books, e.g. Nanotechnology by G. Timp, these are high-throw
<BR>
weight books that will give Nanotech an increasingly legit image.
<BR>
I've heard that Nordly is working on an interstellar nanoprobe
<BR>
book.
<BR>
<P>If you really like nanotech, you can always lurk out on sci.nanotech.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But anyway...what you were saying about nitro bricks...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Basicly it would work but it would just cost too much?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Yep, you gotta put more energy in to manufacturing the bricks
<BR>
than you can get out by having a cooler sink.  Your engine
<BR>
is normally going to operate at 95 C (368K) [slightly less than
<BR>
the boiling point of water], you are sinking that to 21C (294K),
<BR>
so your efficiency is (368-294)/368 = ~20%.  Going to LN2 bricks
<BR>
as the sink @ 63K gives you (368-63)/368 = 82%.  So your engine
<BR>
efficiency goes way up.  Maybe you get 3-4x the MPG?
<BR>
<P>Actually, there might be some problems with doing the calculation
<BR>
this way since the operating temperature that should be used
<BR>
might need to be closer to the fuel-air temperature in the cylinder.
<BR>
[Guess I need to read the books a little more...]
<BR>
<P>I'd have to spend more time than I have today to calculate the costs
<BR>
of making the N2 bricks, but I'm pretty sure the manufacturing costs
<BR>
for the bricks would be much more than the fuel savings.  Figure
<BR>
it this way -- I've heard that Liq. N2 costs about as much as milk.
<BR>
As a very gross estimate, I'd bet you need fill up with several
<BR>
times as much Liq. N2 as gasoline.  N2 bricks would be slightly more
<BR>
expensive and you would have to shovel them into your &quot;locomotive&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Now the interesting thing, if the calculation done the way I've
<BR>
outlined is correct, is that you would win quite a bit by being
<BR>
able to operate your engine at a higher temperature.  (The boiling
<BR>
point of water is way below the ~70% the melting point of steel,
<BR>
which is where metals start getting soft).   You could run at a higher
<BR>
temperature by finding a fluid that boils at a higher temperature
<BR>
and remains liquid wherever you are driving the truck.  In
<BR>
glancing around the net a little, it appears that poly-ethylene
<BR>
glycol (the main ingredient in raditor additives I believe),
<BR>
comes in various molecular weights (more or less &quot;poly&quot;).
<BR>
The higher MWs, presumably have higher boiling (and freezing
<BR>
points).  So if you want to put high MW PEG in your radiator
<BR>
in Florida and low MW PEG in your radiator in Minnesota, you
<BR>
should be able to pick up some efficiency.  You might
<BR>
also need a variable speed pump between the engine and the
<BR>
radiator, so you can precisely control the temperature by
<BR>
varying the rate at which the fluid circulates.
<BR>
<P>For a really good design, you would have to include a centrifuge
<BR>
that would spin the fluid with taps in the inner/middle/outer sections
<BR>
so it could pump the high/mid/low-MW PEG into or out of the circulating
<BR>
mixture, then you wouldn't have to change the fluid as you move
<BR>
around the country.  [This is based on &quot;biology&quot; techniques known
<BR>
as sucrose or cesium chloride gradient centrifugation, where you
<BR>
centifuge the liquids to get different densities at different
<BR>
levels in the test tube so you can separate materials of different
<BR>
molecular weights.]
<BR>
<P>Given what trucks cost and how much fuel they use, I'm surprised
<BR>
someone hasn't thought of this.  The next time you are talking
<BR>
with some engine people Mick, you might ask them about this.
<BR>
Maybe the problem is that you don't have any biologists doing
<BR>
design at the engine companies... :-)
<BR>
<P>The really advanced engines though are totally ceramic, so they
<BR>
didn't need coolant at all and could operate at very high temperatures
<BR>
and efficiency.  Most of that work though has been sidelined by the
<BR>
fuel cell research because of the requirements for reducing pollution
<BR>
levels.  Comparing the efficiency of fuel cells to combustion
<BR>
engines would be an interesting effort (for another day).
