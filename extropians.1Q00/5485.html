<P>Hello John,
<BR>
<P>Zero and I reached the same conclusion on Saturday:
<BR>
<P>[Owen]
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps if we substitute for &quot;imperialism&quot; the word &quot;power&quot; things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be less muddy.  After all, technically there are no &quot;empires&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the world anywhere at this time.
</EM><BR>
[Zero]
<BR>
&lt;Now you're Talkinn’!  I never really had a problem with the position that the
<BR>
US is too busy sticking its nose in where it doesn't belong.  My only point
<BR>
was that “imperialism” is an untrue and hyperbolic characterization of US
<BR>
foreign policy.&gt;
<BR>
<P>My concern regarding this thread is that it might become, as the issue
<BR>
of firearms regulation did, highly emotionalized and thus polemicized.
<BR>
We may want to discuss American foreign policy,  international law
<BR>
and trade in more general terms and that will become unproductive
<BR>
if we get swamped by the feelings we have been taught to feel, think
<BR>
we should feel or have committed ourselves to relative to these topics.
<BR>
<P>So please don't hold it against me if I make a suggestion of a practice
<BR>
that applies to us ALL, while using ONE post (yours) as an example.
<BR>
<P>In MY opinion, your post contains instances of the best approach and
<BR>
the worst.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;BEST:                 &quot;...manipulation in internal matters...&quot;
<BR>
<P>WORST:               &quot;...cruel exploitation of poor...workers...&quot;
<BR>
<P>You see the difference; manipulation is not TOO pejorative, although
<BR>
perhaps &quot;attempts to influence domestic policy&quot; is, I believe, much
<BR>
more unevocative emotionally. But in the worst case, terms like &quot;cruel&quot;
<BR>
are considered in rhetoric and debate as &quot;ad populum&quot; and are used
<BR>
deliberately to inflame feelings. Your phrase contains THREE ad populum
<BR>
words in succession -- a triple whammy!
<BR>
<P>Without putting words in your mouth, or suggesting anyone use vapid
<BR>
euphemisms, in fact &quot;cruel&quot; could be replaced by &quot;insensitive&quot; or &quot;unfeeling&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;exploitation&quot; by &quot;utilization&quot; and &quot;poor&quot; by &quot;underemployed&quot; or &quot;low-income&quot;
<BR>
without loss of information-content and without inflammatory effect.
<BR>
<P>Doesn't &quot;an insensitive utilization of low-income workers&quot; convey your
<BR>
meaning  perfectly well, assuming it is NOT your deliberate intention to
<BR>
be oratorically provocative? And the virtue of it is, you are much more
<BR>
likely to pesuade others to agree with your position if you avoid making
<BR>
them angry.
<BR>
<P>No offense intended, John,
<BR>
<P>Bob
