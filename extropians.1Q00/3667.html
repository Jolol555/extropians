It wasn't meant to be a reply to that particular
<BR>
string... *winces* I just hit reply to make the
<BR>
message sending quicker and forgot to wipe the subject
<BR>
line at the last minute.  *mutters and goes back to
<BR>
playing with worlds*.
<BR>
Oh, hey... Eleizer?  If you're reading this...I've
<BR>
been thinking about your posts on Neurohacking
<BR>
recently... and about some articles I read on Autism,
<BR>
not to mention autistic people I've spoken to.  I was
<BR>
thinking how interesting it would be to be able to get
<BR>
the brain to automatically switch into an autism-like
<BR>
mode for whatever particular subject you were focusing
<BR>
on.  What I mean is, a mode where one subject or
<BR>
problem holds your attention strongly to the exclusion
<BR>
of all other objects... just so long as you were able
<BR>
to operate this &quot;superattentiveness&quot; like a switch, I
<BR>
think it would be a fairly usefull trait to develop. 
<BR>
The only methods that occur immediately are things
<BR>
like biofeedback and autohypnosis... perhaps teaching
<BR>
yourself to lock off certain regions of the brain. 
<BR>
Now I know you're mostly interested in hardware level
<BR>
neurohacking, so here's my idea, somewhat.  One of the
<BR>
articles stated that there seemed to be a portion of
<BR>
an autistuc person's brain that was underdeveloped or
<BR>
missing... I can't remember what specific section
<BR>
right now, but my thoughts are: if it was possible to
<BR>
create a site-specific timed neurodepressant, you
<BR>
could get the same sort of increased focus you get
<BR>
from, for example, caffeine, to a much higher degree
<BR>
for a short time... by depressing the brain's
<BR>
&quot;interrupt factor&quot;.  Or, you could play with
<BR>
stimulating it, to keep yourself out of a rut...
<BR>
*shrugs* it would be a fun thing to play with if you
<BR>
had such a chemical.
