<EM>&gt;     &gt;Each of us exists AT THE PRESENT  MOMENT as a unique physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;construction of atoms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That happens to be true, but it expresses no profound truth, it's just an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accident
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of history. No reason to expect it always to be true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt; It is possible to say this, but that does not make it unambiguous.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;example, what if you make two copies simultaneously? Which one,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;then is &quot;you&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Only one way to tell, ask them. I'll bet you already know what they'll say.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Your entire paragraph of rhetorical questions, that I'll reframe from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;quoting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can be answered if you just stop thinking of yourself as a noun. You are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;an adjective, an adjective modifying matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>Right.  It's all semantics anyway.  If &quot;you&quot; means your *exact* atomic or 
<BR>
neuroligical make-up, then there is no such thing as you, because you are 
<BR>
constantly changing.  The &quot;you&quot; who was you yesterday no longer exists and 
<BR>
there is a new &quot;you&quot; living in your house and driving your car today.
<BR>
<P>You can look at yourself in the mirror and at a 10 year old picture of 
<BR>
yourself and call them both &quot;you&quot; *only* because there have been no 
<BR>
duplicates made of the 10 year old you.  If an exact copy of you were ever 
<BR>
made, *both* copies would be you, but only for the microsecond that they 
<BR>
both had the exact atomic or neuroligical make-up as the &quot;original&quot; you.  
<BR>
But the minute the first atom changed location, or the first cell died, or 
<BR>
the next synapse was formed, neither of them would be &quot;you&quot; and you would 
<BR>
have ceased to exist.
<BR>
