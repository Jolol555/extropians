<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Joe E. Dees&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:joedees@bellsouth.net?Subject=Re:%20near%20anything%20boxes%20allowed%20to%20br%20in%20the%20hands%20of%20the%20public?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000314001152.69842.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">joedees@bellsouth.net</A>&gt;

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Howzabout THIS for not only pejorative, but irretrievably true?  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;cruel and cynical actions of the NRA, as distinguished from their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Madison Avenue bullshit spindoctor-manufactured Hollywood (Prez
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Charleton Heston?  Yagottabekidding!) image, would lead one to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;necessarily believe that the voting majority of their members are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;soulless ghouls who have perpetual hard-ons for and wear their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;emotionally overwrought and bleeding hearts on their sleeves for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lifeless and engineered-for-the-express-purpose-of-death-dealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hunks of metal, but cannot muster a shred of sympathy for dead
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little girls.  They DO sociopathically, and quite obviously, care
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more for killing machines than they do for their fellow human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beings, although to call the rest of the race their &quot;fellows&quot; slurs the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rest of humanity by association with pond scum.  It might be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;impolite to call sick, twisted, demented and bloodthirsty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(&quot;PLEASE, Lord, lemme meet a mugger today and legally kill 'im!)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;psychopaths what they are, but the truth, by definition, can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NEVER be an insult!
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I don't think I would have put it *quite* so bluntly.
