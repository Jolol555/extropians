<EM>&gt;There's a chain of individuals: each fooled into believing he's all the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one's who've passed before him.  This is what I mean when I say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'consciousness' is instantaneous.  You're a sequence of instances, still 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frames, with the happenstance of memory the only connection between them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This is why death doesn't matter - you've already died an infinite number 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of times.  You're being uploaded a trillion times a second.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(end)&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I do see how in a sense the person I was especially ten or fifteen  years 
<BR>
ago is mostly dead.  The natural processes of human development cause  
<BR>
&quot;death and rebirth&quot; even within the lifecycle.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Still, the Star Trek transporter analogy, or the one regarding uploading, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;do unnerve me.  I do not want a perfect copy of myself from a second  ago.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I want me!  Some would philosophically argue that it does not matter  but 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for ME it does.  I would want some sort of interdimensional conduit that  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would whisk me to another location rather then a molecular  reconstruction.
</EM><BR>
As for uploading, I do not want merely a perfect softclone copy of  myself 
<BR>
being made.  I want ME.  I suppose some sort of process where the  matter in 
<BR>
my brain is converted to a pure energy form where it can still  function as 
<BR>
my consciousness with no loss of self-integrity.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
I will be one of those people who will wait a long time to be
<BR>
convinced that uploading does more then kill and then perfectly reconstruct 
<BR>
the individual.&lt;end quote&gt;
<BR>
<P>Consider now the process of action.  Whatever action you chose to take, even 
<BR>
the act of choice, occurs over a span of time.  Thus, the actual act either 
<BR>
has not happened or else has already happened.  From the view that you only 
<BR>
exist in some infinitesimal &quot;present,&quot; there is no reason to act or not act. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;If you mean by consciousness, some kind of process involving a system of 
<BR>
actions, results, feedback and correction resulting in a correct modeling of 
<BR>
reality, then you cannot really claim that you are conscious, as you are not 
<BR>
aware of the next future instant, and will never really be conscious of 
<BR>
anything.  Thus, this line of analysis leads to complete nihilism, the 
<BR>
denial of consciousness, knowledge, etc.
