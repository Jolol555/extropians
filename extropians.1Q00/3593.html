<P><EM>&gt;What I would like *someone* on this list to do is come
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;up with a better definition of what we are arguing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about.  It seems this arguement has downgraded from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;scientific to semantic and philosophical in nature.
</EM><BR>
<P>That would be very difficult. What we are arguing about
<BR>
is whether a particular alleged phenomena is
<BR>
&quot;semantic and philosophical in nature&quot;, or whether it is a
<BR>
concrete, physical, non-mystical, rationally examinable
<BR>
pattern in ordainary, simulatable, computable matter.
<BR>
The instant both sides agree on a rationalist, symbolic,
<BR>
computable definition, the non-computationalists have
<BR>
just abandoned the field.
<BR>
<P>In general, computers can simulate any process that can be
<BR>
described completely and accurately using symbols. (Yes,
<BR>
I _know_ there are pathological cases :). Any rebuttal on
<BR>
those grounds will necessarily include a proof of relevance.)
<BR>
This is the equivalent of defining them. Once qualia are definied
<BR>
in a non-philosophical sense, they are(in all likelyhood) computable,
<BR>
and thus, by some people's definition, cease to be qualia.
<BR>
<P>Not that I understand why, entirely. I see no reason why qualia
<BR>
are necessarily non-computable. Granted that my perception
<BR>
(note the small &quot;p&quot;, Dan :)) of &quot;red&quot; is WAY more complicated
<BR>
then a 64 bit number describing that particular wavelength of
<BR>
light. To use that as an argument against my perception being
<BR>
computable is a strawman. I am not a paint matcher. My brain
<BR>
has millions, possibly billions of interacting subsytems. That's
<BR>
room for a lot of complexity in my mental structures, including the
<BR>
mental structures that shuttle perceptions from one end of my
<BR>
brain to the other. My perception of &quot;red&quot; is more complicated
<BR>
then the aforementioned 64 bit number. This is obvious. But is it
<BR>
_so_ obvious that my perception is more complex then a multi
<BR>
gigabyte strongly interlinked symbolic structure of the colour,
<BR>
pointers to the semantic primitives and actual hardware of the
<BR>
visual cortex, links to memories, links to knowledge of associated
<BR>
phenomenon (the siren of a fire engine), etc...?? The answer is a
<BR>
very firm &quot;not really&quot;. This isn't obvious at all. And so neither is the
<BR>
non-compuatbility of qualia.
