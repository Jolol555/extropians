<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; I define evil as simply abject selfishness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Funny, that's pretty much how I define what's good and noble.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The sine qua non of evil for me is dishonesty. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Clearly many people will consider your philosophy of abject selfishness evil.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Do you enjoy taunting them with that construct? Some selfishness is healthy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but complete abject selfishness is boring, teious and painfully gauche. It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-social and associated with all of the &quot;evils'&quot; YOU decribe below
</EM><BR>
<P>There is a distinct difference between selfishness and self-centeredness. Also
<BR>
different are ego-centric, megalomaniacal, and sociopathic. Many traits of these
<BR>
other characteristics are politely refered to as 'selfish' but are actually far
<BR>
less rational, and far more malignant and rapacious.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  &lt;&lt;Now I think we probably mostly agree on the specific acts we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  would classify as &quot;evil&quot;: murder, torture, etc.; but I can't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  view these as acts of selfishness, because if one were truly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  selfish and educated emself on the best techniques to profit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  from others, &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ahh. So you are not talking ABJECT selfishness, but &quot;educated&quot; selfishness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One that is tempered by a need to plese others. If only to better serve one's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own goals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps your words do not describe your ideas plainly, but in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preachroneous fashion.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ha. Well, for those who value selfishness as a good thing, it is presumed that
<BR>
the listener understands the difference between rational selfishness and petty or
<BR>
irrational selfishness (the polite terms for the more malignant behaviors
<BR>
referred to above.) This is perhaps some supporting evidence to Lee's argument
<BR>
that politeness is not always a good thing as a rule. I much prefer the 18th
<BR>
century English practice of calling things by their right names. Rather than
<BR>
calling a man 'suave', he would be called a whore-monger.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ey would choose to cooperate and trade because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  that's a more profitable strategy than predation in the long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  run.  Most acts that are described as &quot;selfish&quot; are not evil
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  because they are selfish, but because they exhibit irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  short-term thinking. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So abject selfishness perhpas is not entirely rational?
</EM><BR>
<P>abject, or petty selfishness, is not rational because it completely discounts
<BR>
negative returns beyond the short term gains that might be accrued, and is
<BR>
performed merely for petty self-aggrandizement of the moment, its a instant
<BR>
gratification thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &lt;&lt;The truly selfish individual takes the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  long view, because ey wants to live forever and be obscenely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  rich, not just make a few bucks for the moment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Long or short viewed, the truly selfish individual is not valued by others,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and is often over valued by his/herself.
</EM><BR>
<P>I value selfish people much, at least rational selfish people. I know that they
<BR>
value themselves as highly as I do myself. Because of this mutual understanding,
<BR>
we are able to treat each other as free and equal human beings who are
<BR>
responsible for themselves. There are no issues of dependency, and I know that
<BR>
the word of such individuals is good because they value their own integrity as
<BR>
one of their core assets, and are unwilling to compromise it.
