<P>&lt;&lt; This is great stuff!  This needs to be fleshed out into a full-size book 
<BR>
&nbsp;with Seussian style artwork to go along with it!&gt;
<BR>
<P>Thanks! I am not much of a writer, I just like to play!

PS
<BR>
This is a good example of deriving vs. stealing. If I did publish such a 
<BR>
book, it would be *more* than derivative, yet it would not be stealing. Not 
<BR>
enough to get sued anyway, since I am not copying his verse verbatim, just 
<BR>
snagging his &quot;style&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Now if Lee was to clip and paste *my* poem into his own book and sell it - 
<BR>
THAT would be stealing, and I hope you guys would back me up on that, 
<BR>
libertarians or not!!!
<BR>
<P>On the other hand - ethically, if i did a Suess rip-off, no matter how cute 
<BR>
and charming, *I* would feel like I was stealing, not to mention, unoriginal!!
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; Please consider what I've said.  You have created a seed that should be 
<BR>
&nbsp;allowed to sprout and not die.

<P>(Thanks again for the lovely compliments, however I could not sustain enough 
<BR>
interest in this project to finish it, and I have so much to do these days!!)

I'd love to publish a children's atheist/agnostic book though... someday, 
<BR>
sigh.... when I have time... yeah right!
