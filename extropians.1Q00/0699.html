<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
I've been talking to the producer of the BBC television programme Heart of
<BR>
the Matter, and it now looks like they want to do a show on life-extension
<BR>
(maybe touching on cloning as well).
<BR>
<P>The show takes itself quite seriously, it is broadcast prime time, and the
<BR>
producer seems relatively knowledgable and positive. The format is as
<BR>
follows: The show starts out with a &quot;polemics&quot;: about 8-minutes of arguments
<BR>
and soundbites in favour of some position or proposal. This is then followed
<BR>
by a studio debate, where maybe half a dozen people argue about the issues
<BR>
raised by the polemics. The general style is quite serious and (for being
<BR>
TV) intellectual.
<BR>
<P>I've been asked to prepare a few-hundred words draft for the polemics, and I
<BR>
may also take part in the studio debate. I'm working on getting them to
<BR>
invite my friend David Gems, who is a geneticist and life-extension
<BR>
researcher, and, shall we say, open to the transhumanist point-of-view.
<BR>
<P>Since the show is on prime time BBC national television, and we might get up
<BR>
to eight minutes of free air time (what would that cost in advertising
<BR>
money?), it is worth putting some effort into this. The draft for the
<BR>
polemics need to be available for the producer when he arrives at his desk
<BR>
on Monday morning, so we need to get to work right away. There is no
<BR>
guarantee that they will use it, but if we do it well, I think there is a
<BR>
50% chance.
<BR>
<P>So what I need help with from knowlegable people here is to prepare the &quot;few
<BR>
hundred&quot; words polemics. It doesn't matter if it's longer, because they will
<BR>
have to trim and modify it anyway if they decide to use it. I want it to
<BR>
achieve two basic things: 1) explain to the viewer that radical life
<BR>
extension can be made possible, it's only a matter of time; and 2) make the
<BR>
viewer activly desire life-extension for herself. I have not yet decided
<BR>
whether or how to: introduce cryonics; talk about extreme life-extension
<BR>
(abolition of ageing) or only moderate life-extension; explain
<BR>
nanotechnology; introduce uploading; broaden it to include some other
<BR>
transhumanist themes as well. 
<BR>
<P>As a starting point, we may use the following section from the FAQ (sorry
<BR>
this message is getting a bit long - those who aren't interested in
<BR>
participating may tune out at this point):
<BR>
<P>==
<BR>
Why do transhumanists want to live longer?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Have you ever been so happy you almost wanted to scream? Was there a
<BR>
&nbsp;moment in your life when you felt something so deep and sublime that it
<BR>
seemed
<BR>
&nbsp;like all your everyday life was but a dull gray slumber?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;It is so easy to forget how good things can be when they are at their best.
<BR>
But on
<BR>
&nbsp;those rare occasions when you do remember---whether it's through being
<BR>
totally
<BR>
&nbsp;absorbed in creative work, or it's the sense of achievement, or the ecstasy
<BR>
of
<BR>
&nbsp;romantic love---you realize just how valuable every single minute of
<BR>
existence can
<BR>
&nbsp;be. And you may have said to yourself: &quot;It ought to be like this always.
<BR>
Why can't
<BR>
&nbsp;this last forever?&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;Well, what if it could?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;When transhumanists seek to extend human life span, they are not trying to
<BR>
add
<BR>
&nbsp;a couple of extra years of senility and sickness at an old persons' home.
<BR>
That
<BR>
&nbsp;would be pointless. No, what they want is to create more healthy, happy,
<BR>
&nbsp;productive years. Ideally, everybody should have the right to choose when
<BR>
and
<BR>
&nbsp;how they want to die---or not to die at all. Transhumanists want to live
<BR>
longer
<BR>
&nbsp;because they want to do, learn and experience more than they can in a
<BR>
normal
<BR>
&nbsp;human life span. They want to continue to grow and mature and develop for
<BR>
&nbsp;much more than the meager eight decades allotted to us by our evolutionary
<BR>
&nbsp;past. As the sales pitch for one cryonics organization goes:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&quot;The conduct of life and the wisdom of the heart are based upon time; in
<BR>
the last
<BR>
&nbsp;quartets of Beethoven, the last words and works of 'old men' like Sophocles
<BR>
and
<BR>
&nbsp;Russell and Shaw, we see glimpses of a maturity and substance, an
<BR>
experience
<BR>
&nbsp;and understanding, a grace and a humanity, that isn't present in children
<BR>
or in
<BR>
&nbsp;teenagers. They attained it because they lived long; because they had time
<BR>
to
<BR>
&nbsp;experience and develop and reflect; time that we might all have. Imagine
<BR>
such
<BR>
&nbsp;individuals---a Benjamin Franklin, a Lincoln, a Newton, a Shakespeare, a
<BR>
Goethe,
<BR>
&nbsp;an Einstein---enriching our world not for a few decades but for centuries.
<BR>
Imagine
<BR>
&nbsp;a world made of such individuals. It would truly be what Arthur C. Clarke
<BR>
called
<BR>
&nbsp;'Childhood's End'---the beginning of the adulthood of humanity. You could
<BR>
be a
<BR>
&nbsp;part of this. And you should be. Join us. Choose life.&quot; (The Cryonics
<BR>
Institute)
<BR>
==
<BR>
<P>Depending on which other themes we choose to introduce, other FAQ sections
<BR>
may also be relevant. But at a minimum, we need to extend these paragraphs
<BR>
with an argument for why life-extension is feasible. (The producer
<BR>
explicitly said that he wanted that.) So we should explain what the most
<BR>
promising avenues of research are and probably mention some of the
<BR>
following: gene therapy (somatic or germ line), as following on the human
<BR>
genome project; stem cells research; organ replacement; antioxidants;
<BR>
caloric restriction; nanomedicine; some recent exciting findings (DAF-genes
<BR>
etc.); other interesting data.
<BR>
<P>If someone could write a few paragraphs about these things, that would be
<BR>
most helpful. Other people, who are not expert in this area, can also help
<BR>
by providing sound bites, quotes, interesting points or arguments, or any
<BR>
other resource that can help. It has to be done immediately. I need to have
<BR>
it by tomorrow noon, so I can post a draft for feedback tomorrow evening.
<BR>
<P>A crucial consideration: we can't use anything dry. It has to make people
<BR>
&quot;sit up &amp; take notice&quot;, the producer said. So we want snappy, witty,
<BR>
fascinating stuff that takes us into the &quot;WOW this is it!&quot;-zone. If anyone
<BR>
can deliver something on such short notice, I'd appreciate it very much.
