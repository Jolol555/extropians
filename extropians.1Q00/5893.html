<P>That freaking cool!  It's more productive than just telling jokes.:)  (I
<BR>
worked for a trucking company a few years ago and I knew a few truckers who
<BR>
were readers, though most were not.  (Heck, most people are not!  I know a
<BR>
lot of people who work in my current venue who do not read anything for
<BR>
pleasure.)  One trucker always had a novel with him.  His son was an English
<BR>
major at a local college...  That people were surprised at this only shows
<BR>
how powerful the stereotypes are.)
<BR>
<P>EvMick might also consider like keeping an extra copy of something really
<BR>
accessible to all -- like _The First Immortal_ -- to give away.  I would
<BR>
not, if I did this, act like a salesman with free samples.  Instead, I would
<BR>
just always have a copy in my truck and pass it along.  At about $7 a pop,
<BR>
it's not too expensive and the novel itself, though not the best in terms of
<BR>
new ideas per page, is probably good for anyone, even if the reader is not
<BR>
all that interested in science fiction.
<BR>
<P>My two bits!
