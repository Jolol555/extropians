<EM>&gt; [once again, only time for a brief comment . . .]  Hal, this sounds like a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very attractive way to address potential opposition to transhumanist goals.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but let me ask you, how would you apply these principles into action if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic engineering humans for the prupose of augmentation were outlawed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everywhere on the planet?  I'm not saying that's likely, but I DO believe 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it is at least POSSIBLE.  Can women in Afghanistan &quot;peacefully coexist&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the Taliban?
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree that this would be an undesirable outcome, but I also agree that
<BR>
it is not very likely.
<BR>
<P>Modern communications media like the internet foster greater diversity.
<BR>
I hope and expect that diversity will breed tolerance, both because more
<BR>
tolerant communities will be able to thrive in a diverse environment,
<BR>
and correspondingly, intolerant communities will find it difficult to
<BR>
enforce their restrictions on the net.
<BR>
<P>Keep in mind that those who fear change have their own nightmare: a world
<BR>
in which genetic engineering and augmentation is used universally, and
<BR>
everyone is effectively forced to do so just to survive the competition
<BR>
that results.  In many ways this is just as bad an outcome.  Complete
<BR>
memetic victory is no better than total defeat.
<BR>
<P>Better to seek for ways to coexist, to have a world where some people
<BR>
experiment with new ideas and new ways of life, while others retain
<BR>
the traditions of the past.  Religion has a place in the future, as
<BR>
do environmentalism, communism and other forms of social cooperation,
<BR>
and many other meme sets which we tend to see as our opponents.
<BR>
<P>My ideal world is not one in which everyone is just like me, and I am
<BR>
sure most of us feel the same way.  Practicing tolerance of those with
<BR>
different views is an important step towards that world.  Think of it
<BR>
as Gandhian non-violence brought into the memetic world, memes which
<BR>
attempt to coexist without defeating their rivals.
<BR>
<P>I realize that this is pretty fuzzy in terms of specific prescriptions
<BR>
for action in the real world.  I don't claim to have a fully fleshed
<BR>
out philosophy here; these are ideas which I am exploring and offering
<BR>
for consideration.  It has long seemed to me that the traditional mode
<BR>
of discourse, argument and rebuttal, is not very successful.  I believe
<BR>
we have seen mostly failures in our own debates here.  We are much more
<BR>
successful when we are working cooperatively, brainstorming together,
<BR>
bouncing ideas off one another.  I would like to see us find a way to
<BR>
bring this kind of approach into a larger arena.
<BR>
<P>Hal
