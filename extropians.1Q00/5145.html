<P><EM>&gt; In this day where almost every citizen has a large and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rapidly growing stock portfolio, and the ability to purchase huge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; amounts of computing power...
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you really think that is true, even in America (let alone the developing
<BR>
world)? The _minority_ of citizens have a stock portfolio, and the minority
<BR>
have the ability to purchase huge amounts of computing power. No doubt the
<BR>
demographic on this list is different, but don't extrapolate it to 'every
<BR>
citizen', without first calling in at your local benefits agency, charitable
<BR>
hospital, shelter for the homeless, etc. and asking the people there whether
<BR>
they prefer PC or Macs, or how their bonds are performing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ...every individual is going to have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability to do and get almost anything they want, completely ignoring
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any central government elite or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As above: no, they're not.
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But there is no logical reason why any advanced, able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become anything he wanted being would even want to do such absurd and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrational kinds of &quot;bad&quot; things...
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since people of this type do not necessarily act on 'logical reason' when
<BR>
they carry out atrocities today, the lack of a 'logical reason' in the
<BR>
future will not stop them continuing to carry them out.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Now that we've finally achieved the ability
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to grow intentionally and intelligently, rather than via unintelligent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; survival of the fittest random mutations, there is no reason to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; selfish, domineering, or whatever.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there is. Technology is not cost-free, and resources are not (yet)
<BR>
unlimited. Nor are intention and intelligence guarantees of agreement. I'm
<BR>
not sure what the reaction to GM foods in the US has been like, but in the
<BR>
UK it serves to illustrate that technological advancement is far from
<BR>
controversy-free, and thus necessitates a degree of selfishness and
<BR>
domination on behalf of both its 'pros' and its 'antis'.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	Once we (machines included) can really feel whatever we want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to feel, and not what our creator hard wired us to want to feel, we'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all really want to wire these feelings to do only good things.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(A personified creator?)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why will we want to wire feelings to do only good things? Or, perhaps, why
<BR>
will we _all_ want to do that? If someone has a rabid desire for power,
<BR>
domination and territory, and sees technology as a way to achieve those
<BR>
aims, why would that individual choose to remove those feelings, rather than
<BR>
carpe his diem? And who will decide which things are 'good' and which are
<BR>
'bad'?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Pure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cold hard logic will dictate that all of our ancestors that died
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; before making it to this future glorious immortal heaven are our real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creators and the ones that gave us this glorious gift for free.  They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are the ones that really deserve it... &lt;snip&gt;... The only way to really do
</EM><BR>
this,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; according to cold hard logic, is to find some way to resurrect every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; last one of our ancestors, to completely achieve a perfect history...
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so welcome back to Stalin, Hitler, Jack the Ripper, Vlad the Impaler...
<BR>
whom cold, hard logic dictate to be a few of our glorious creators.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I make it to that future time, I will always feel lonely without, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indebted to all of my ancestors which are my real creators.  To think
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that a more intelligent being than myself will have less of such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; desires, especially logical machines, seems to me to be completely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; absurd, illogical, and irrational.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I don't know. Perhaps 'guilt' and 'loneliness' will be considered
<BR>
negative, 'bad', emotions, and someone will have decided to wire them out,
<BR>
as you suggested.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 	We are about to overcome the evil of all future death and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suffering.  That's the easy part.  But, there will still be people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that are still dead, the only real &quot;evil&quot; that will remain.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are not about to overcome all future suffering, and the removal of
<BR>
death, and resurrection of the dead, will not end all evil.
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in summary. At some point in the future, the dead will be resurrected,
<BR>
and will join the living. A judgement will be passed to decide what is good
<BR>
and bad, and the bad things will be removed. Then everyone will live in
<BR>
heaven where everyone is happy and there is no suffering. I can't help but
<BR>
find this has a familiar ring to it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But things that are good have an obvious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advantage over all that is bad, namely, that which is &quot;Good&quot;, is by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition, that which everything and everyone one wants.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are very few things indeed which &quot;everything and everyone wants&quot;.
<BR>
Therefore, almost nothing is good. As an example, in talking to people, I
<BR>
find that many are happy to die, and consider it unnatural and undesirable
<BR>
to live forever. The problem in your definition is made evident, as you
<BR>
continue:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which is &quot;bad&quot; is, by definition, what everyone and everything wants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to overcome.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You are dichotomizing good and bad. What of all those things which, by your
<BR>
definition, are neither good nor bad: those things which some people want,
<BR>
and others do not. &quot;Good&quot; and &quot;bad&quot; are subjective concepts, and any
<BR>
assessment of good/bad for a population of greater than one can take place,
<BR>
at best, on a majority basis. Your argument started by claiming that
<BR>
individuals would become self-governing. If that is the case (which I would
<BR>
dispute), then there will be disagreements, not perfect, tranquil,
<BR>
happiness.
