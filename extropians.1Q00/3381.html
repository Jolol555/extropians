but why not find a way of changing our emotional state into that &quot;noble&quot; 
<BR>
state - of humility and resignation or whatever - directly, rather than go 
<BR>
through the inefficient and horrendous process of getting to that state 
<BR>
through having long series of painful experiences. That would be lot more 
<BR>
transhumanist in my book
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I can't help but say on a kneejerk level that I find this somehow a quickfix 
<BR>
that offends me.  And as Anders pointed out, to really affect personality 
<BR>
and &quot;lifescript&quot; the technology must on a very deep and complex level 
<BR>
restructure the brain.
<BR>
<P>And yet the world would be a better place if people could choose early in 
<BR>
life certain neuro mods that gave them the type of maturity and emotional 
<BR>
makeup they wanted for themselves.  I have known so many people who dearly 
<BR>
wish as youth they had the wisdom and maturity they have now in their later 
<BR>
years.
<BR>
<P>But even in a world of neuro mods, some questions remain.  What mods are 
<BR>
really right for you to have a quality life that fulfills your own unique 
<BR>
potentials?  You could choose the wrong one's?  A person might decide early 
<BR>
on that ambition and status are key and create a driving and relentless 
<BR>
personality.  They might never or too late realize how at least for them 
<BR>
this was a mistake.  I would still take the chance for myself but try to be 
<BR>
balanced in my approach.
<BR>
