<P>
So substitute the word &quot;operator&quot; pr &quot;shooter&quot; for the word &quot;sniper&quot; or
<BR>
&quot;sharpshooter&quot; and the discussion can continue. 
<BR>
<P>One with better 3D models than I might be able to deduce if the &quot;hide&quot;
<BR>
or &quot;blind&quot; was improvised by operators out of fallen housing materials,
<BR>
and if its placement was consistent with establishing a field of fire
<BR>
sufficient to control the (expected?) exits in that area, possibly
<BR>
including parts of the building opened up by the fallen materials.
<BR>
<P>I don't know if there were any windows, etc. facing that putative
<BR>
&quot;courtyard&quot;, nor do I know anything about the intelligence available to
<BR>
the operators. It's possible they knew where every threat was, all the
<BR>
time. They surely weren't short on surveillance gear. So, though high
<BR>
risk, perhaps it didn't need to be highly defensible. Or maybe there
<BR>
were Spectra-laid trauma plates just behind the wood. I don't know if
<BR>
the Davidians were in any shape to make excursions enough to account for
<BR>
the appearance of this whatever-it-is.

<EM>&gt; &gt;I spent several hours studying the earlier Waco video a few months ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I agree that, based on these photographs, a structure of some sort is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;present in the courtyard on the day of the fire, which was not there a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;few days ago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;However I question whether this would be a &quot;sniper's nest&quot; for a couple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;reasons.  The main one is that this does not seem to be a very reasonable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;position for a sniper to hide.  It is in the courtyard, surrounded on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;three sides by buildings occupied by the people he would be sniping at.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;It does not appear to be a very defensible position, as he could have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;bullets coming at him from three directions.  Further, he would himself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be firing at virtually point-blank range.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;&quot;Sniping&quot; usually connotes a somewhat long-distance firing activity.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Placing your &quot;nest&quot; in the middle of the enemy's courtyard, mere yards
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;from the walls, just seems utterly absurd.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   IAN: Your analysis seems reasonable on its face.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   We should note that the tank's penetration around
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the rear of the gym, with supplemental machinegun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   fire, was obviously providing cover for the close-in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   sniper(s). The thermal flashes in the courtyard are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   very pronounced, and can be broken down into rapid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   fire of machine guns. The vast majority of expert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   analysis says they are gun shots, and the initial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   counter explanation of sunlight reflections has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   been invalidated and abandoned by the FBI. Now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the FBI says (1) that FLIR can't pick up gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   shots and (2) the flashes are glitches on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   tape. (1) is false, &quot;Waco: A New Revelation&quot; shows
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   FLIR tape of a gun fight where gun shots are visible
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   in the exact same way seen at Waco. (2) is improbable,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   since the locations of flashes over time remain fixed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   with respect to the ground, even as the camera changes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   it's location. In short, flash locations are not random.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   Why shots would be fired so close is odd, but I believe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the evidence indicates that they were. There must be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   reason why they needed to get so close, maybe we'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   figure it out. As for the snipers nest. I got word
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   from one of the lawyers that the tank punched the wall
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   out at that point (not visible on the FLIR) and a sniper
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   or snipers used the punched-out-wall as a makeshift hide.
