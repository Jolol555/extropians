<EM>&gt; Hi, Loree. I was also a nuke (ETRO). I was on a fast attack sub out of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; San Diego in the late 70s. Hated it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I was on the Pintado (SSN 672) out of San Diego in '76, Transfered to
<BR>
the Queenfish (SSN 651) out of Pearl Harbor from '77 - '80.
<BR>
<P>I didn't hate it.  The work was challenging (electronic control circutry
<BR>
can fail in strange ways...) and at times it was even exciting
<BR>
(dangerous) and when the boat was underway there was plenty of time to
<BR>
read.  Visiting places like the Philipines, Guam, Adak Alaska, Korea,
<BR>
Thailand, NZ and Australia is something I might never have done
<BR>
otherwise.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Well, I don't suppose I have ever thought of it that way, but yes I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; guess transgendered people are in the vanguard of transhumanism.
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;G&gt;  Especially the do-it-yourselfers who only do a partial transition.
<BR>
There isn't much that is transhumaninst in nature in going from
<BR>
traditional male to traditional female (or vice versa) along a clearly
<BR>
defined path monitored by a pshrink.  The &quot;sex-change&quot; industry seems to
<BR>
enforce the rigidity of gender, rather than allowing individuals to
<BR>
transcend it.
<BR>
<P>Now that I've got my body where I like it, I want to hang on to it for
<BR>
as long as possible, ya know?  Also, mental enhancements sound good to
<BR>
me.  I suppose I'm bright enough by gausian human standards, but I feel
<BR>
a little out of my league in this group.  As real enhancements become
<BR>
possible, I want to be in the vanguard.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;From your website pix, it looks as though you have successfully 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;crossed the gender line.
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks.  I don't know if &quot;crossed the line&quot; is the right terminoloy,
<BR>
however.  To me gender is more of a spectrum, with hypermasculine at one
<BR>
end and hyperfeminine at the other. 
<BR>
<P>I'm somewhere near the middle.  
<BR>
