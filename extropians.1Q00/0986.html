<EM>&gt;from an Extropian standpoint, most of us would strongly agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the one-man-one-vote principle.  But, &quot;rationally&quot; can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you make an argument that this will result in the best government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;when the people are either educated by &quot;sound bites&quot; or not at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all?  One might look more at something like the judicial system
</EM><BR>
<P>Funny, this very topic came up in a class last night (a class in which I 
<BR>
introduced transhumanism). My vote is for replacing the current system with 
<BR>
a working Foresight Exchange (ideas futures). I suppose you can still have 
<BR>
one-warm-human-body/one vote, but you'd be voting for representatives who 
<BR>
would have to take into account the results of the Foresight Exchange. Any 
<BR>
ideas on how, constitutionally, you could force the representatives to use 
<BR>
the Exchange results in their legislation? If we could get the idea futures 
<BR>
process widely accepted, it would tend to put pressure on legislators to 
<BR>
follow it (especially if you could easily go on the web and check a 
<BR>
representatives voting record against the ideas market's recommendations). 
<BR>
But it would be good if there were a way of compelling reps to follow 
<BR>
this--and a good democratic argument can be made that this would mean a 
<BR>
more pure form of democracy in the sense of following the informed will of 
<BR>
the people. (Given how much Americans love to gamble, I suspect that 
<BR>
participation rates would be higher than we see in many elections too.)
<BR>
<P>Onward!
