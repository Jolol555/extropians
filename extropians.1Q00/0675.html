<EM>&gt; I recommend Julian Simon's &quot;The Ultimate Resource&quot; as a good starting point
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for this topic.  He deals at least breifly with just about every significant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environmentalist claim of the last few decades, and (being an economist) he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bases his arguments on numbers rather than emotion or philosophy.  The book
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also has lots of usefull references to sources of data on environmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; degradation, resource consumption, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>This book is available online at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Colleges/BMGT/.Faculty/JSimon/Ultimate_Resource/">http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Colleges/BMGT/.Faculty/JSimon/Ultimate_Resource/</A>
<BR>
<P>My impression, having read a few chapters (alas, the diagrams are
<BR>
missing from the online version), is that Julian Simon deals only with
<BR>
the human side of pollution, by which standard, of course, any Western
<BR>
civilization produces infinitely less pollution than any Third World
<BR>
country.  But I would call that cheating.
<BR>
<P>As near as I can figure, Julian Simon simply ignores the question of
<BR>
damage dealt to the actual planet, as opposed to living conditions. 
<BR>
Part of this may be justified on the grounds that no damage whatsoever
<BR>
is being done to the planet - he points out that all the expected waste
<BR>
production of the US during the 21st century (Singularitarian note: har
<BR>
har) would fit in a nine-mile by nine-mile square dump, which is not a
<BR>
significant amount of land.  Likewise, the years since the big
<BR>
waste-disposal scare, people built better, higher-tech dumps and now
<BR>
waste disposal is simply no longer a problem.  Some states, he says, are
<BR>
trying to pass regulations that would prevent people from hauling waste
<BR>
*out* of the state to cheaper dumps, since existing dumps are suffering
<BR>
from lack of business.  I'm not entirely sure I believe him, but it
<BR>
sounds like a plausible outcome.  Scarcity, high prices, overinvestment,
<BR>
surplus, low prices.  (God, I hate this economy.)
<BR>
<P>As for consumption of resources like copper, his case is that we should
<BR>
expect the supply to keep increasing forever, just like it always has. 
<BR>
Projecting the actual future for the, what, two decades we have left, I
<BR>
see no reason to dispute this.
<BR>
<P>Julian Simon doesn't discuss the greenhouse effect or any other sort of
<BR>
atmospheric pollution in planetary terms, only human terms; thus, his
<BR>
whole argument is that modern pollution is infinitely better than the
<BR>
six-inch layer of horsemanure over nineteenth-century London, or the
<BR>
disease-ridden conditions of poor countries, which is certainly true
<BR>
from an individual perspective, but doesn't address &quot;damage to the
<BR>
planet&quot; at all.
<BR>
<P>Julian Simon does demonstrate, convincingly, that higher-tech is
<BR>
cleaner, but that's only progress *within* Western civilization.  Damage
<BR>
to the enviroment, rather than damage to living conditions, is never
<BR>
considered explicitly; nor is Western damage compared to Third World
<BR>
damage rather than lower-tech Western damage.  So if someone could
<BR>
demonstrate that there is no possibility of actual damage being done to
<BR>
the planet, which Julian Simon only attempts explicitly in chapter 18,
<BR>
then Julian Simon would constitute the whole of the argument.
<BR>
<P>This was definitely a very useful resource which answers at least half
<BR>
the problem.  Thank you, Billy Brown.  Nonetheless, I'd still like to
<BR>
know about Western and Third World emissions of carbon dioxide and so
<BR>
on, in the hopes that it will turn out that the Third World has a higher
<BR>
prima facie pollution rate, which would settle the issue entirely.  So
<BR>
I'm still accepting references.

<BR>
<P>Quote of the day by absolutely anyone's standards:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;    ???BCE: Running out of flint. Worries about running out of resources have been with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us since the beginning of time.  Shortages surely occurred in many places. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Archaeologists studying two Mayan villages in Central America found that about 300 BCE 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the village far from plentiful flints supplies, there was much more conservation 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and innovation by reusing the flint in broken implements, compared to the village with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plentiful flint nearby.  The Neandertals could produce five times more cutting edge 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from a block of flint as could their predecessors.  And successors of the Neandertals 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increased their efficiency to be produce 80 times as much cutting edge per block as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Neandertals predecessors. Eventually, flint was replaced by metal, and scarcity 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; declined.  This is the prototype of all resource scares.
</EM><BR>
<P>And more:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    Late 1700s: With the invention of lightning rods came fear of electricity 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accumulating in earth (B. Franklin's time).
</EM><BR>
<P>And the hideous tragedy:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;    1945:  DDT, sensationalized by Rachel Carson in 1962.  Said to cause hepatitis.   
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Discontinued in U.S. in 1972.  Known then to be safe to humans (caused death only if 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eaten like pancakes).  Some damage to wildlife under special conditions. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    With the aid of DDT, &quot;India had brought the number of malaria cases down from the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; estimated 75 million in 1951 to about 50,000 in 1961. Sri Lanka...reduced malaria from 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about three million cases after World War II to just 29 in 1964&quot;. Then as the use of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; DDT went down, &quot;Endemic malaria returned to India like the turnaround of a tide&quot;.  By 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1977 &quot;the number of cases reached at least 30 million and perhaps 50 million&quot;.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   In 1971, amidst the fight that led to the banning of DDT in 1972, the president of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the National Academy of Science - distinguished biologist Philip Handler - said &quot;DDT 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is the greatest chemical that has ever been discovered&quot;.  Commission after commission, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; top expert after top Nobel prize-winning expert, has given DDT a clean bill of health.    
</EM><BR>
<P>Is Rachel Carson still alive?  Let's have her tried at Nuremburg and hung.
