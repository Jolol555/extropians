<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;What about the UCLA study of vitamin C published in 1992?  This was not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;most rigorous study, but it tracked over 11K individuals over about a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;decade.  The findings?  Men taking 800 mg of vitamin C per day lived
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about 6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;years longer than those taking 60 mg of the same per day.  Another 9 year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;study completed in 1996 with a similar population size seemed to confirm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;this, though the study focused on vitamins C and E, rather than just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;vitamin
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  &gt;C.  Granted, those are only two studies, but that beat Lee Daniel's above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt; &gt;statement.

<EM>&gt;&gt;      The problem with  these studies is that there's no way to control
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  for other variables.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  The kind of person who takes 800 mg of vitamin C probably does a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  great many other things to enhance life extension: e.g. exercise, eat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  a low-fat diet, and of course take other vitamins.  The person who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  takes 60 mg probably isn't too serious.  Until it's possible to do an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  extensive long-term study of individuals so isolated that every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  possible variable affecting their health is controlled it won't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;  possible to take these studies seriously.  And who would volunteer?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TechnoT:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I think that while long term such studies are not perfect, they indicate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something.  Also, the particular studies I mentioned are not the only ones.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;There are plenty of short term studies with vitamin C where the variables
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;are controlled much more fully and other factors are measured (e.g.,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;homocysteine levels in blood) and the lot of these seem to point in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;direction of the two I mentioned.  Extrapolation is not forbidden...:)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Long term studies, if not &quot;perfect&quot; (i.e. replicable), prove 
<BR>
nothing;  what they &quot;indicate&quot; is in the mind of the believer.  Short 
<BR>
term studies by definition can't tell anything about life extension. 
<BR>
Extrapolation is not forbidden in science fiction, but in science...?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Also, the mechanisms by which that particular nutrient works are becoming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;more well known.  Ultimately, what one wants is a causal explanation of why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it works at all.  (This is typically how one finds out why it does not work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in all cases and how one can develop a regimen.)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your first two sentences appear to contradict each other and  I 
<BR>
don't understand your third.  Maybe it's just me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;There are plenty of short term studies on other supplements which show them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;working to alleviate one problem or another.  One must study them and make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;judgements regarding the costs and benifits.  But anyone who says there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aren't any studies on this (as Lee Daniel did several posts ago) is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;misinformed.  (Or a lot of what I've read on the subject for the past decade
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is all wrong.  I sure hope not.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please cite the peer-reviewed  studies that appeared in 
<BR>
professional journals.
<BR>
&quot;Prevention&quot;  and news articles don't count.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Also, remember, my original post in this thread was _not_ in advocacy of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;popping pills, but of a broad spectrum, informed approach to life extension.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My goal -- and I hope the goal of all or many of you reading this -- is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;live longer, healthier, and happier -- not merely to adhere to some doctrine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of self-medication.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually take vitamins myself (just bought more ester-C  today) 
<BR>
because I've never heard of a reputable study showing that anything I 
<BR>
take is *harmful*, and I can afford to waste the money if they don't 
<BR>
really help.   I'm still waiting for the research that will &quot;prove&quot; 
<BR>
any vitamin supplement to be helpful for anything,  but I remain 
<BR>
(forgive me Robert Owen) a hopeful agnostic.
