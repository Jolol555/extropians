<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars Polar Lander Mission Status
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;January 25, 2000
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mission managers have decided to send another set of 
<BR>
commands to Mars to investigate the possibility that a signal
<BR>
detected by a radio dish at California's Stanford University
<BR>
came from Mars Polar Lander.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The commands were sent at 10 a.m. PST today.  They will 
<BR>
instruct the lander, if it is operating, to send a signal 
<BR>
directly to Earth to the antenna at Stanford on Wednesday, 
<BR>
January 26, at approximately 1 p.m. PST.  The Stanford receiving 
<BR>
station will listen again during the window on Wednesday to see 
<BR>
if it picks up a signal that could originate from Mars.  The 
<BR>
results of this test will not be immediate and it will take the 
<BR>
team several days to process the data.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mission managers sent commands several times in December and 
<BR>
January instructing Polar Lander to send a radio signal to the 
<BR>
45-meter (150-foot) antenna at Stanford. Although no signal was
<BR>
detected in real-time, the team in charge of the Stanford antenna
<BR>
says that after additional processing of the data they may have
<BR>
detected a signal that could have come from Mars during tests
<BR>
on December 18 and January 4. Because the signal was so weak, 
<BR>
it took several weeks for the Stanford team to process their 
<BR>
data and reach this conclusion.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This week's test is a real long-shot, and I wouldn't want 
<BR>
to get anyone too excited about it,&quot; said Richard Cook, Polar 
<BR>
Lander project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
<BR>
Pasadena, CA.  &quot;The signal that the Stanford team detected is 
<BR>
definitely artificial, but there are any one of a number of 
<BR>
places it could have originated on or near Earth.  Still, we need 
<BR>
to conduct this test to rule out the possibility that the signal 
<BR>
could be coming from Polar Lander.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If in fact the signal were from Polar Lander, two failures 
<BR>
would have had to occur.  First, the lander's X-band radio that
<BR>
it would use to transmit directly to Earth would have to be broken.
<BR>
Second, there would have to be a problem somewhere in the relay
<BR>
with Mars Global Surveyor that prevented the signal from being 
<BR>
picked up and relayed by the orbiter.  It is unlikely that a broken 
<BR>
transmitter on the lander could be fixed, and unclear whether a 
<BR>
problem with the relay could be resolved.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although the Stanford data from the previous tests took 
<BR>
several weeks to process, the team expects to have results within 
<BR>
several days now that they know what they are looking for.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if the signal were coming from the lander, there is 
<BR>
little hope that any science could be returned. However, it would 
<BR>
give the team a few more clues in trying to eliminate possible 
<BR>
failure modes.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mars Polar Lander is managed by the Jet Propulsion 
<BR>
Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science, Washington, DC. 
<BR>
Lockheed Martin Astronautics Inc., Denver, CO, is the agency's 
<BR>
industrial partner for development and operation of the 
<BR>
spacecraft. JPL is a division of the California Institute of 
<BR>
Technology, Pasadena, CA.
