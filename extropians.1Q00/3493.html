<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If you insist on a low level definition of such a fundamental mental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; phenomenon then you must first explain what &quot;means&quot; means and give a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; non circular definition of &quot;definition&quot;. Good luck, you'll need it.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can't get off this easy!  This is what I hate about the
<BR>
way so many people approach this debate.  So many people get lost in
<BR>
the complexity of intelligence, the entirety of all possible
<BR>
definitions..., and they think that somehow consciousness is hidden in
<BR>
all this, and that perhaps we will somehow not be able to comprehend
<BR>
it all ourselves.  I'd argue that a non circular definition of
<BR>
&quot;definition&quot; and of &quot;meaning&quot;... is possible, but it would be so
<BR>
complex that our conscious abilities can't quite represent it all.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as I see it, the important part of consciousness and their
<BR>
phenomenal qualities has nothing to do with all this.  Let's take, for
<BR>
example, the pencil in a clear glass of water for discussion purposes.
<BR>
I think even this is way to complicated for our purposes since the
<BR>
trivial case is simply to say that a &quot;red&quot; sensations is defined to
<BR>
represent 700 nm electromagnetic radiation and that its meaning comes
<BR>
out when this is added to the diversity of all other colors and such.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with the pencil in a clear glass of water example, at
<BR>
least we can get some simple &quot;spatial&quot; meaning or definition which is
<BR>
hopefully a bit easier to relate to and relative to what you seem to
<BR>
be asserting.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The spatial meaning of my conscious percept is simply: The
<BR>
pencil is bent.  My conscious model of the pencil is a 3D replica that
<BR>
means precisely what it spatially is.  It &quot;seems&quot; to mean to me that I
<BR>
can reach in and touch the pencil in the water at a certain location,
<BR>
when in fact when my finger enters the water, my visual representation
<BR>
of the finger, too, becomes incorrectly modeled.  It *seems* to be in
<BR>
a different location when in water.  In order to actually touch the
<BR>
part of the pencil in the water, I must compensate for my incorrect
<BR>
conscious representations and move my finger accordingly.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is all very simple, all sufficiently defined, and all has
<BR>
clear spatial meaning.  This is a very simple model.  We have proved
<BR>
this is possible because we can make robots with identical
<BR>
representational problems and incorrect internal representations or
<BR>
&quot;seemings&quot;.  Even though representations used by today's robots are
<BR>
merely abstract while ours are &quot;phenomenal&quot;.  Also computer
<BR>
representations have numerical 3D information but other than that, are
<BR>
not in any related way 3D (why today's spatial robots are so inept?).
<BR>
While I'm betting that our 3D representations are actual 3D in nature
<BR>
within the neural structure of our primary visual cortex.  (I've got a
<BR>
paper describing some of this by Steve Lehar and myself if anyone is
<BR>
interrested. &lt;URL: <A HREF="http://www.frii.com/~allsop/pcave1.ps">http://www.frii.com/~allsop/pcave1.ps</A>&gt; Let me know
<BR>
what you think of it if you read it!)
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you saying there is something relevant to whether or not
<BR>
qualia exist outside of such simple examples of spatial meaning and
<BR>
definitions?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There isn't much complexity at all in what red is like.  Red
<BR>
is simply phenomenally Red, and can be used to mean whatever we want
<BR>
it to mean, from 700 nm light, to stop, danger, warmth, love, my
<BR>
favorite color or whatever.  This debate is simply about what red is
<BR>
like, not what it means or could be defined to be and how complex
<BR>
intelligence uses such representations.  Just as the nature of a
<BR>
single bit, inside a robot's brain, doesn't have much to do with it's
<BR>
intelligence, meaning, perception algorithms, and so on and so forth.
<BR>
I believe it's a critical mistake to get unnecessary lost in the
<BR>
complexity (and even worse to in a hand waving kind of way claim that
<BR>
the missing parts of one's theories are some how hiding within such)
<BR>
when thinking only about what, why, and how qualia are or even if we
<BR>
really have them.
