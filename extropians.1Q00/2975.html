<EM>&gt; &gt; A little off the subject but can someone explain to me why people promoting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; terraforming of Mars still think it will hold a man made atmosphere despite the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; believed theory that it lost it's atmosphere in the first place due to it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; diminutive size and thus lack of sufficient gravity?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, here goes my tri-monthly de-lurk...
<BR>
<P>In Greg Egan's &quot;Diaspora&quot;, a group of post singularity aliens accomplished this
<BR>
(weighing an atmosphere down) by inserting extra neutrons into the nuclei of
<BR>
everything on the planet. One of the characters described it as &quot;... they inserted
<BR>
the changes at the lowest level, beneath the ecosystem.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Would this actually work? In other words, would Terran biochemistry (as distinguished
<BR>
from any other kind, 'natch :)) continue to work if everything was the next stable
<BR>
isotope up?
<BR>
<P>More to the point, can _unmodified_ humans breathe a heavy oxygen/heavy nitrogen
<BR>
atmosphere without developing lung cancer, or asphyxiation, or similar
<BR>
unpleasantness?
<BR>
<P>Furthermore, what would this do the the half-life of the atmosphere? My knowledge of
<BR>
gas behavior (does this fall under chemistry, physics, or celestial mechanics? ) is a
<BR>
little weak (CS degree). Actually, it consists almost entirely of what I've learned
<BR>
here. Say for example in the simple case, where each particle in the atmosphere is
<BR>
twice as heavy as it was before. How does this affect atmospheric dissipation rates
<BR>
due to Brownian motion and/or insufficient gravity?
<BR>
<P>As a first approximation, a particle at the top of the atmosphere will dissipate if
<BR>
it exceeds the escape velocity of the planet at that altitude. The average velocity
<BR>
of all the particles in the atmosphere is simply another way of expressing the
<BR>
temperature of the atmosphere. Conclusion number one: if the atmosphere was all heavy
<BR>
atoms, the particles would move less for the same energy input, and would therefore
<BR>
be colder. (unless I'm wrongly conflating the vibration identified as heat with the
<BR>
vibration identified as Browning motion. Anybody feel free to jump in :))
<BR>
<P>So if the rate of dissipation of the atmosphere is proportional to the temperature of
<BR>
the atmosphere, then doubling the mass of the particles should roughly double the
<BR>
atmosphere's half-life.
<BR>
<P>Anybody feel free to tighten this up somewhat?
