Here's a story about reaction to a plan to set up a pharmaceutical ranching 
<BR>
project in New Zealand.  Two things of note here.  First, take a look at the 
<BR>
language used by the reporter: &quot;Many New Zealanders are outraged by the 
<BR>
project, which they have dubbed  'Frankenstein's farm'.&quot;  Who are these &quot;many 
<BR>
New Zealanders&quot;?  How many?  What are the bases of their &quot;outrage&quot;?  We don't 
<BR>
really get any answers to these questions, but no public SUPPORT for the 
<BR>
project is even mentioned.
<BR>
<P>Second, note this: &quot;Protest groups such as Revolt Against Genetic Engineering 
<BR>
(Rage) are gaining support and the Green party - which holds the balance of 
<BR>
power in a coalition with Labour - is pressing the government to impose a 
<BR>
moratorium on field trials of cloned and genetically altered animals.&quot;  The 
<BR>
Green Party is explicitly identified as the &quot;legitimate&quot; political front for 
<BR>
anti-biotech action and is linked with a group that seems proud to go by the 
<BR>
acronym &quot;RAGE&quot; . . .

<EM>&gt;   'Dolly' man to clone herd of 1,500 cows

<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  SCIENTISTS are building the world's first clone farm. A researcher from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, which created Dolly the sheep, has moved to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  New Zealand to help build up a 1,500-strong herd of genetically engineered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cows.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The cows, intended to produce medicines in their milk, will mark the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  attempt to use cloning in commercial agriculture. Eventually clone farms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  could be set up throughout the world to help combat diseases including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  multiple sclerosis and cystic fibrosis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Many New Zealanders are outraged by the project, which they have dubbed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &quot;Frankenstein's farm&quot;. They say that it and another scheme for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  10,000-strong flock of &quot;transgenic&quot; sheep will destroy New Zealand's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  reputation for being free of genetic engineering.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  AgResearch, the New Zealand government agency behind the farm, has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  established its cloning programme at Ruakura, on the North Island, using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  friesian holstein cattle. The cloning programme is led by David Wells, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  formerly worked at the Roslin Institute with Ian Wilmut, one of the 
</EM><BR>
creators
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  of Dolly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Dolly was created by destroying the nucleus of a sheep's egg cell and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  replacing it with another taken from an adult cell of an entirely different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  sheep. The cell divided and grew into an embryo that was implanted into a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  surrogate mother.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Wells has used a similar technique to create 16 cloned friesian heifers. He
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  has added a further refinement, also perfected at Roslin, by inserting 
</EM><BR>
human
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  genes into the cloned embryo.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The result is that each heifer contains the human MBP gene which, in 
</EM><BR>
humans,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  enables the body to manufacture myelin. This substance surrounds nerve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  cells, enabling them to conduct impulses, and is absent or faulty in people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with multiple sclerosis (MS).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  When the heifers are mated, their female offspring produce milk containing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  human myelin basic protein (MBP). This can be extracted and could prove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  useful as a treatment for MS, a neurological disorder that affects about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  85,000 people in Britain. AgResearch also hopes to introduce the human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  myostatin gene - responsible for controlling muscle growth - into other 
</EM><BR>
cows
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  to produce compounds to help people with muscular dystrophy, a crippling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  genetic condition that stops muscle development.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Dr Harry Griffin, a spokesman for Roslin, confirmed that it had close links
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with AgResearch. &quot;There is a small community of scientists in this area and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  David Wells and Ian Wilmut are following each other's progress and working
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  closely,&quot; he said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Roslin also has close links with PPL Therapeutics, which is seeking to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  establish a 10,000-strong milking flock of transgenic or genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  modified sheep on a hill farm at Mangakino, in the central area of the 
</EM><BR>
North
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Island.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  The sheep have been genetically modified to contain the human gene for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  alpha-1-anti-trypsin (AAT). This can be extracted from their milk to treat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  conditions such as cystic fibrosis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  PPL likes to operate in New Zealand because, as well as its freedom from 
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  sheep brain disease scrapie, land is cheap and rules governing genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  engineering are relatively weak.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  That attitude could change rapidly. Protest groups such as Revolt Against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Genetic Engineering (Rage) are gaining support and the Green party - which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  holds the balance of power in a coalition with Labour - is pressing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  government to impose a moratorium on field trials of cloned and genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  altered animals.
