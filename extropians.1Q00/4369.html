<P><EM>&gt; Michael, if constitutionality actually mattered most of the government would

<EM>&gt; downloaded MP3 files as income at the retail price of the equivalent CDs,

<EM>&gt; irrelevant to the issue.

<P>Hi.  I know I'm probably jumping into this conversation a bit late, but its been
<BR>
over 6 months since I was last on the list.  Here is a simple proposal.  Please
<BR>
feel to improve upon it or attack its basic premise:
<BR>
<P>A server is set up offshore. On this server is housed a sophisticated barter
<BR>
exchange.  The way it works is simple.  If you have something to sell, you post
<BR>
it online.  The catch is your selling your identity to the buyer for 300 'barter
<BR>
units'.  'Barter units' are fictitious units of value that are measured by the
<BR>
consensus of the people on it.  If you want to sell that used VW of yours for a
<BR>
million barter units that's your business.  Keep in mind that another individual
<BR>
is selling his brand new Lexus for 5000 barter units, so you're likely never
<BR>
going to sell that used VW of yours.  Very soon, as more people begin to buy and
<BR>
sell items online using this fictitious currency, it will soon reflect a
<BR>
reasonable value. The other catch is that barter units have no legal value
<BR>
outside of the online environment of this offshore barter exchange.  In the end
<BR>
you are not buying that car with units, only the opportunity to acquire it.  The
<BR>
seller in turn gets barter units to acquire opportunities elsewhere on the
<BR>
exchange. Of course, people can start trading these fictitious barter units for
<BR>
things in the real world, and that's where things get really fun!
<BR>
<P>In the meantime, as more and more items are available online, more people will
<BR>
will want to participate - a predictable result of a networked economy.  As more
<BR>
people join, the more value is added, and thus even more people are enticed to
<BR>
join.  Before too long, big players like Amazon.com, Buy.com and even the
<BR>
emerging ECN's start &quot;trading&quot; on this new offshore barter system. The barter
<BR>
exchange company is very careful to maintain that these barter units are not
<BR>
currency, only an arbitrary measure of value online to facilitate the barter
<BR>
process.  And yet in essence the boundary between barter and currency becomes
<BR>
completely blurred, as it ironically has always been.
<BR>
<P>The question of the night is, with the easy and availability of public-key
<BR>
encrypted schemes for both users and the transaction of these fictitious
<BR>
&quot;units&quot;, what's keeping people from capitalizing on such a fantastic idea?  If
<BR>
the exchange assesses a mere 1% unit acquisition on each barter, the exchange
<BR>
stands to make a considerable amount of units for themselves to barter with.
<BR>
<P>Since it is conducted offshore and identities of all the participants are only
<BR>
made available to matched buyers and sellers, how can it be taxed?  Unless I'm
<BR>
overlooking something, such a system could eventually mature into a full-fledge
<BR>
online e-conomy where everything is available tax free and anonymous.
<BR>
