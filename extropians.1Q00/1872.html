<EM>&gt; One other item in the book that bothered me.  I've heard it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;gloom and doom&quot; types on radio and I've pretty much 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discounted it.  The idea 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is that were the Ross Ice Shelf in Antartica to be released 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so that it went 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; floating off it would destabilize the earths rotation with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ugly results.... 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Kinda like a tire out of balance.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My feeling is that the mass disparity is too great.  The  mass of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Antartic Ice in comparison to the mass of the earth is less 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than comparing  a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pebble in the tread of one of my trucktires......no big 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deal....and besides 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my autobalancers would compenstate...as would the ocean compensate...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Don't know if it's so far fetched.  my personal knowledge in the matter is
<BR>
nill, but i read an article in new scientist (either 28/11/1998 or
<BR>
5/12/1998, can't remember) about someone proposing that 600 million years
<BR>
ago the earths tilt was at around 51 degrees (they were using this to
<BR>
justify the fact that there used to be glaciers around the equator at that
<BR>
time), but since the earths tilt is &quot;known&quot; to have been around 23 degrees
<BR>
about 430 million years ago they needed  to find a quick way of changing the
<BR>
earth's tilt by that amount in that short (170 million year) period.  one of
<BR>
them suggested that ice formation around the current poles would have
<BR>
shifted the tilt by the needed amount.  the contention from other geologists
<BR>
seemed to be the difficulty in the creation of the ice in the right places,
<BR>
not in the maths of the tilt shift which suggests that the calculations in
<BR>
that department were correct.  i'll see if i can find it again.
