analogies meant to subvert the point of view she'd posted earlier):
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'm open to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any possibilities. :) (I didn't say that's what *I*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thought would happen, just that I recalled someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;saying that before. I was just trying to bring up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;multiple viewpoints. :) )
</EM><BR>
<P>Okay, but what I was presenting in rebuttal had nothing to do with how *you
<BR>
personally* felt about the objection you raised. In fact, I probably
<BR>
wouldn't have been so sarcastic - and hence potentially hurtful - unless I
<BR>
felt I was directing my scorn at an idea rather than a specific person.
<BR>
<P>More generally: I suppose everyone here likes to suppose that we're open to
<BR>
more wild possibilities than usual, but the whole point of science is to
<BR>
*throw bad ideas out* (although they can always be brought back later, if
<BR>
we get an ah-ha! and understand that they're *not* such `bad' ideas after
<BR>
all). Science winnows out the dried crap and disposes of it, freeing up the
<BR>
mind to focus on useful, corroborated approaches that are not madly
<BR>
inconsistent with everything else that's been established with such
<BR>
tremendous communal effort.
<BR>
<P>(Mandatory bow, for all that, to the ghost of Kurt Godel, and to the
<BR>
apparent incompatibility of relativity and quantum theory, and the still
<BR>
inexplicable data of lab parapsychology...)
