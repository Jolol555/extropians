<EM>&gt;Yes, but suppose half a `primitive' population (such as California) were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paid to pray to the gods and perform fertility sorcery, and then a cultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;shockwave abolished this faith. What follows? They weren't making or doing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anything truly useful (except keeping themselves occupied and perhaps
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;raising morale), now nothing has changed except the readiness of the other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;50 percent to pay for them. (Is that a useful analogy? Maybe not.)
</EM><BR>
<P>The world economy doubles every fifteen years, and that is in effect
<BR>
what happens when the economy doubles.  For this change to make a real
<BR>
different in world growth, it has to happen faster than in fifteen years,
<BR>
or the world has to keep growing in other ways as it happens.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What, then, are the sales staff selling? What goods are being carefully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stored and moved long distances?  Who fill the skyscrapers doing what?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What vast trucks rumble over the big bridges? Feedstocks?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think you have a clear picture of the economy you live in.
<BR>
All those salesfolk and skyscrapers are not mainly there to move stuff
<BR>
from factories to your home, or even to design the things the factories
<BR>
make.  They perform lots of other useful functions.  Maybe you should
<BR>
go visit a skyscraper someday and ask people what they do :-).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The fraction of software effort now using the open source route is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;miniscule, the gains to specialization in production are now enormous,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That was now, this is then.
</EM><BR>
<P>Whether this is now is the open question we are discussing.
<BR>
It is far from obvious that gift production will dominate design or
<BR>
that gains to production specialization will disappear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;With AI agents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;taking over most of the scut-work of filing and organizing and perhaps even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;entertaining, and praying to the gods for us, many service industries will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;go the way of that 30 percent of manufacturing etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>Assuming advanced AI is very different from just assuming early nanotech.
