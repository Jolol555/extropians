<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; What are the tax rules for exchanging houses?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  How about international exchanges?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;  What are the barter-regulating laws in general?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;I'm no tax lawyer (perhaps THAT is the lowest form of life), but the US tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;system is designed -- in theory -- to &quot;capture&quot; income and capital gains from in-kind exchanges.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So if you and I bought houses in Bay Area 50 years ago for $30K apiece,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and now want to swap them (while they have the estimated market value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of $1M each), each of us will have to pay about $300,000 ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And for that, each of us would have to sell the house and move
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to some God-forgotten area like Boston?
</EM><BR>
<P>Capital gains on home sales, so far as I know, are not incurred if the
<BR>
money is re-invested back into real estate, if its a primary home, or if
<BR>
you put that money into oil well exploration (wildcatting).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What if people swap &quot;usage rights&quot;.  I still &quot;own&quot; my house,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and you owe yours, but we swap usage rights for them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - Shadow ownership of sorts.   Same for everything else.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You still &quot;own&quot; the groceries, I am just digesting them  :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (Maybe the govt. could also collect its duties in barter?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For every 3 family members you would have to host one bureaucrat)
</EM><BR>
<P>This all goes to what the IRS tried to institute a few years ago. They
<BR>
tried to say that you could potentially be earning income on your house
<BR>
by renting it out (if you were'nt living in it), so you are implicitly
<BR>
enjoying that income by not charging yourself rent. If you lived in
<BR>
Gregs house, and he lived in yours, charging each other no rent, the IRS
<BR>
might claim you were earning an income on that house equal to the
<BR>
marketable rent value.
<BR>
<P>So far as I know, the courts have thrown out this argument, and the
<BR>
Taxpayer Bill of Rights explicity forbids the IRS to do this.
