</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Sorry, but most of the books of the New Testament were letters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; written by Paul, who never met Christ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, Paul converted to Christianity a couple of years after Christ was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; killed, after he had been dispatched to Damascus to put down a Christian
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; community which he subsequently joined, but it might be fair to say that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he was a contemporary of Jesus, was closely associated with the some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the earliest Christians, and was able to recount the life and teachings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Jesus.
</EM><BR>
<P>You claimed that most of the books of the New Testament were written by
<BR>
Apostles who personally knew Christ.  Paul is not an eyewitness to Christ.
<BR>
He cannot recount the life and teaching of Jesus.  He can only repeat what
<BR>
he has been told, as do modern believers today.  Paul cannot give historical
<BR>
evidence for the existence of Jesus.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The Jews consider Jesus to have been a Rabbi (religious teacher),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I would like to see some evidence of this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I can't provide a specific quotation from a Jewish authority, but it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not surprising to me that he could be called a Rabbi, since he was a Jew
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who instructed Jews on religious matters, and had many followers, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is pretty much the definition of a Rabbi.  A controversial Rabbi, to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sure.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are using the Christian bible as evidence again.  There are no Jewish
<BR>
sources that list Jesus Christ as a recognized Rabbi.  You are not citing
<BR>
any Jewish historical evidence for Jesus.  You are repeating what the Bible
<BR>
says again.  You are citing the bible as evidence for itself.  This is not
<BR>
independent historical evidence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and Islam lists Jesus as a prophet, one of many prophets who came
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; before&gt; Mohammed,&gt; &gt; the Seal of the Prophets (the last prophet).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Mohammed was born around 570AD, and died around 632AD.  The writings
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; attributed to him occurred after that date, over 600 years after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Christ.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even though Mohammed lived centuries after Jesus, it would not preclude
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jesus being recognized by Muslims as a prophet.  The holy building called
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Kabaa, which looks like a black cube, located in the center of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; religious compound at Mecca, was built by Abraham (according to legend),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so that suggests that Islam reveres Abraham, who long pre-dates Jesus,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and who is part of the Jewish tradition.  The Muslims call Jews and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christians 'People of the Book', meaning that Jews and Christians adhere
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the holy scriptures which pre-date the Koran, and Muslims allow that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Jews and Christians worship the one true God.  That suggests that Muslims
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respect the scriptures of the Christians and the Jews, just as Christians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respect at least some of the scriptures of the Jews.  I don't have a copy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the Koran, much less one with an index, so I can't easily look up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whether any mention Jesus actually appears in the Koran.
</EM><BR>
<P>You make my point for me.  The Muslims respect the scriptures of the
<BR>
Christians.  They quote the New Testament passages as saying Jesus existed.
<BR>
Again, you cite quotations of the New Testament as evidence for Jesus.  The
<BR>
Muslims do not have independent historical evidence for Jesus Christ.
<BR>
<P>All three of your examples boil down to quoting the New Testament references
<BR>
to Jesus.  You have not presented any historical evidence outside of the
<BR>
Christian scripture itself.  We all are aware of the Christian scripture.
<BR>
The question is whether there is any historical evidence outside of the
<BR>
Christian claim that Jesus actually existed.
