<EM>&gt; &gt; What stumbles occured with nuclear power? Even counting Chernobyl (more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a result of socialism than nuclear technology) and the two bombs dropped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; on Japan there are still fewer people killed by nuclear technology in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its entire history than are killed every year by the pollution of coal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; burning technology, and coal burning plants put more radioactive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; materials into the environment every day than the entire US nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; industry has released in its history.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Remember &quot;electricity too cheap to meter&quot;? Possibly not, as that was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rhetoric used in the UK to promote nuclear power in the 1950's.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nuclear electricity was grossly oversold because when the second
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation reactors were being introduced -- the first post-military
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generation -- they were installed without any thought about decomissioning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; costs. In some cases (e.g. the USSR) they were installed without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; any disaster planning -- as witness the RBMK reactors built with no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; containment vessels. (If Chernobyl had been equipped with a western-style
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; containment vessel, the accident would have caused no consequences worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than Three Mile Island.)
</EM><BR>
<P>If the Chernobyl reactor had been of western design, it would not have been able
<BR>
to go as far as it did.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To make matters worse, civilian reactors were based on military designs;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for example, the PWRs used in the west were originally based on scaled-up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; naval propulsion reactors. This means essentially we have lightweight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; high performance reactors, not reactors optimized for (a) safety, (b)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economical operation, and (c) easy decommissioning. (I'm inclined to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ascribe this to the fact that most nuclear developments were government-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; led from the start, except that without government intervention it's hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to conceive of a commercial entity building the damn things in the first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; place.)
</EM><BR>
<P>You are forgetting that the breeder reactors that France uses are actually of
<BR>
more military value, in addition to having the advantage that they burn off all
<BR>
of their high level nuclear waste. The anti-nukers here didn't want such plants
<BR>
because then there would not be a waste problem, and they'd have to get real
<BR>
jobs.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The upshot is that nuclear reactors today are a bit like space launchers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; -- hyper-evolved military spin-offs, expensive, powerful, but unreliable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and not really suitable for low-cost, safe, civilian use. The problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with this picture is that there is no nuclear equivalent of ROTON or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Beal or Kistler on the horizon; because nuclear technology has strategic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; military implications, no government is going to let some bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eccentric whacko technology entrepreneurs reinvent it in a cheap, fast,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and out-of-control format that can prove its merit on the open market.
</EM><BR>
<P>And they won't be allowed to develop it without fulfilling every government
<BR>
bottleneck and triplicate form, or without billions of dollars in legal fees
<BR>
fighting the greens in court. The number one reason why nuclear power is
<BR>
uneconomical in some parts of the country is that the legal fees have increased
<BR>
the cost of the project to such a large extent.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; While some countries are shutting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; down their nuclear plants, they are increasing output at their coal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; plants, and are buring lower quality coal than ever before.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Or natural gas. In the UK, coal plants are being shut down and switched
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to methane-burning turbined at remarkable speed. Meanwhile, the nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry is moribund.  The real exceptions are France and Japan, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for reasons of state policy are building potloads of nuclear reactors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By 2020, a much higher proportion of the UK's electricity will be nuclear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than is the case today -- and it will be imported from France.
</EM><BR>
<P>Who have no waste problem. However, you didn't comment on my main assertions
<BR>
about the coal industry.
