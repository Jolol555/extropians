You raise some interesting points, but I think there's another way of
<BR>
looking at it. I tend to think of consciousness as an instantaneous
<BR>
phenomenon: In every instant we are alive, and in every instant we die and
<BR>
are then reborn. It's only memory that generates the illusion of
<BR>
continuity - in every resurrection we inherit the memory of an infinite
<BR>
number of previous fleeting lifetimes, from which we construct
<BR>
subjectively continuous experience.
<BR>
<P>Take, for example, Star Trek style transporter rays. You take me apart, an
<BR>
atom at a time, throw the remnants away and reconstruct a copy at a
<BR>
distance. In at least an intuitive sense, the copy 'isn't me.' You've
<BR>
murdered me, albeit in a peculiarly baroque way. The fact that there's
<BR>
someone else walking around who thinks he's me is, from my oblivious
<BR>
perspective, neither here nor there. I'm dead - just as dead as if you'd
<BR>
shot me or cut off my head. For the copy, of course, the experience is of
<BR>
course one of displacement. The copy would quite happily be transported
<BR>
again, since he's already done it and knows it's safe.
<BR>
<P>What if, in every instant of our lives, we are the copy? I have a
<BR>
subjective experience for every letter I type - I'm a living qualia soaked
<BR>
thing for a single quantum of time - but I'm dead before I lift my finger
<BR>
off the key and someone else, with all my state and memories, finishes the
<BR>
word. He remembers the person who started the sentence, he remembers him
<BR>
so well that he thinks it was himself, but, really, he isn't. That person
<BR>
died.
<BR>
<P>-matt, having a much harder time expressing himself than usual.
