<EM>&gt; Do we really want the whole world using UNIX?  I'll answer

<EM>&gt; that question for you - no!
</EM><BR>
<P>It would be a huge improvement over the whole world using Windows.
<BR>
It's not clear whether you feel that Unix is architecturally
<BR>
insufficient for future needs (perhaps, though being well understood
<BR>
and having decades of field testing are huge advantages) or that the
<BR>
currently available UIs are no good (Irrelevant, you can put any UI on
<BR>
top of Unix you want.  Hopefully soon open source UIs will achieve ease
<BR>
of use parity with Windows (e.g., &lt;<A HREF="http://www.eazel.com/">http://www.eazel.com/</A>&gt;) and some
<BR>
developers will move on to more radical interfaces.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But here's the trillion dollar
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; question, what OS will we be running in the near future if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not Windows?  Mac OS?  BeOS?  OS/2 Warp?  Anyone know of any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promising non-UNIX open source projects?
</EM><BR>
<P>Look around at
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Open_Source/">http://dmoz.org/Computers/Software/Operating_Systems/Open_Source/</A>&gt;.
<BR>
<P>EROS &lt;<A HREF="http://www.eros-os.org/">http://www.eros-os.org/</A>&gt; looks very interesting and GNU/Hurd
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html">http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd.html</A>&gt; continues to make slow
<BR>
progress.
<BR>
<P>I don't expect any of these to be running on many comuters anytime
<BR>
soon.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I recently read an article in which a journalist claimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that because of the Web, it doesn't matter what OS you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; using as long as it can run a browser.  I've seen other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; journalists claim similar things.  When people genuinely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; believe bastardised hypertext is the pinnacle of human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; achievement it's time to innovate, and fast!
</EM><BR>
<P>Who is claiming that HTML/HTTP is the pinnacle of human achievement?
<BR>
The journalists you mention have a very valid point.  In the past the
<BR>
most used applications were word processors and spreadsheets, all of
<BR>
which used closed data formats and tied users to a single platform.
<BR>
Office applications are changing very slowly, but now the most
<BR>
frequently used applications are the web and email.  For the most part
<BR>
it really doesn't matter what platform you use for these applications.
<BR>
<P>I don't see this changing anytime soon.  I expect that the vast
<BR>
majority new applications rolled out in the near future will reuse
<BR>
parts of the existing XML/HTTP infrastructure and be platform neutral.
<BR>
Some will even be truly innovative.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sometimes I wonder if the current dot-com madness, which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; places the emphasis not on technology but on some vague idea
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a future business model, is simply due to a lull in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; software development due to our underestimating the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; complexity of voice interfaces and other exotica.  Is there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; room for something new or should we wait until there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough hardware to do more exotic forms of human-computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interaction, or perhaps even remove the human altogether?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't see voice or even near-term VR interfaces as revolutionary.
<BR>
They just provide more ways for a single human to interact with a
<BR>
computer.  Some people will prefer them to typing and clicking, some
<BR>
won't.
<BR>
<P>The net and technologies build on top of it were truly revolutionary.
<BR>
They turned glorified filing cabinets and calculators into
<BR>
communication enablers.  It isn't surprising that years and $billions
<BR>
of new business models have arisen from this revolution.
<BR>
<P>I'm no visionary, so the near future looks to me like the recent past++
<BR>
(more bandiwdth and more ubiquity).  More value-producing
<BR>
communications not involving humans at all could be revolutionary.  Of
<BR>
course people have been talking about agents for a long time.  I want
<BR>
my distributed AI!
<BR>
<P>BTW anyone know anything about or have an opinion of
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.processtree.com/">http://www.processtree.com/</A>&gt;?  They claim to be building
<BR>
infrastructure for a for-pay distributed processing network (and
<BR>
are collecting email addresses in a multilevel fashion) but
<BR>
don't make available any substantial information about their
<BR>
technology or who they are.
<BR>
<P>BTW2 the subject of this thread may be a bogus rumor generated by the
<BR>
infamous Corel CEO's big mouth.  See
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/000309/corel_1.html">http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/000309/corel_1.html</A>&gt;.  Can't complain too much
<BR>
though, I bought into CORL when it first got involved in Linux and was
<BR>
practically worthless.
