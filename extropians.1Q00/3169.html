Subject: Re: MS Funded/Founded by NSA?
<BR>
<P>Very well, your rebuttal would be an informative addition
<BR>
to the file, if you don't object.
<BR>
<P>To pick up on a couple of your points:
<BR>
<P>There should be a sustained burst of activity from Europe
<BR>
on the Echelon affair as EuroParl deliberates on it, guided by
<BR>
the four 1999 Echelon reports prepared by its technological
<BR>
research department, STOA. The one most recently featured
<BR>
for its allegations about Wintel is, &quot;Development of Surveillance
<BR>
Technology and Risk of Abuse of Economic Information (an
<BR>
appraisal of technologies of political control):&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://cryptome.org/stoa-r3-5.htm">http://cryptome.org/stoa-r3-5.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>The Cukier CFP99 report Matthew cited presents a useful summary
<BR>
of Echelon-like activities by nations other than the US.
<BR>
<P>Wayne Madsen is quoted today in Canada's National Post that
<BR>
the EU hearings are a joke. That all nations spy on each other
<BR>
and only a fool thinks otherwise:
<BR>
<P><P><A HREF="http://www.nationalpost.com/news.asp?s2=worlds3=observer&f=000219/210021.html">http://www.nationalpost.com/news.asp?s2=worlds3=observer&f=000219/210021.html</A>
<BR>
<P>And Wayne Madsen wrote yesterday of Net intrusions and attacks
<BR>
by the USG, with the probability that it carried out the US &quot;hacker
<BR>
attacks:&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://cryptome.org/madsen-hmhd.htm">http://cryptome.org/madsen-hmhd.htm</A>
<BR>
<P>Which of these charges and countercharges and dismissals
<BR>
are conventional bread and butter propaganda and which are
<BR>
new revelations, that may never be known for certain.
<BR>
<P>Would that San Diegian be the gent who bragged of snagging
<BR>
Mitnick?

<P><EM>&gt;It's probably a boullaibaise (sp?) of paranoid conspiracy theory,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;journalistic sensationalism, piling on, French nationalism, and a desire to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;distract attention away from French industrial espionage. (Recall the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;confirmed report that Air France was bugging commercial travellers.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;PC-DOS was so primitive in 1980, when IBM's Boca Raton division--itself a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;backwater, led by Phil &quot;Don&quot; Estridge--that it is inconceivable that it had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any &quot;spying&quot; hooks built in. I mean, come on! Besides which, it was written
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;initially by Tim Patterson, of Seattle Computer, and only bought hastily by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;MS when it looked like they would get the IBM contract. (So the French
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;paranoids would claim that Tim Patterson was operating his little company
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in Seattle with the intent of selling his spy software to MS. Get real.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;PC-DOS, later MS-DOS, was also small enough in those days that nearly every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;function could be analyzed in detail, and the code could be dissected.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Ditto for the chips. I worked for Intel during that period when this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;supposed NSA &quot;Operation Wintel&quot; was being developed, and I can assure you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the chips of the day had no particular features of interest to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;NSA, save for some of the well-known bit twiddling instructions wmight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;otherwise have been. (But a lot less well-suited than it _could_ have been.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Most compellingly, until fairly recently the Net was primarily run off of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sun and similar computers...we all know that, of course. Sniffers on Sun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;networks would have been more interesting (and there's anecdotal evidence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that a certain San Diegan developed precisely those tools for the NSA).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Arghh..where to continue? Consider that at least several other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;manufacturers of Intel-compatible chips exist. AMD, obviously. But also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Cyrix/National/Via, and Texas Instruments, and IBM. Did all of them design
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in the &quot;special NSA sections&quot;? Without any of them talking?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(And these are only the recent deals. In the past, Matra/Harris, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;French-affiliated company, was a producer. Ditto for a bunch of others,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;American, European, and Asian. All of them in on the conspiracy?)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As a paranoid theory, it's not even interesting.

<P>[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  Tim May asked that I include his comments

if I fowarded his rebuttal:  &quot;...but tell them I won't respond to any

e-mail. (I hate it when my words show up on some list and I get a 
<BR>
bunch of questions from East Bumfuck, Nebraska asking what I &quot;meant.&quot;

People on other lists don't have context for my comments.) And tell

them if they crosspost to me, I'll reply with 500 messages for each

of theirs.&quot; --Tim May]
