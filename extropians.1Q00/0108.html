<EM>&gt;Almost a year ago Ian Goddard wrote a convincing update on the TWA 800
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;downing.  I was at a party yesterday, talking to a 747 freight pilot, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discovered he knew a great deal about the TWa 800 saga as he had taken a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deep interest in it.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: The sad thing is that, while the missile 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;theory is strong inside the aviation industry,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;almost nobody will talk about it in public. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;They know all too well what happens to people 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;who do. The cover-up will probably succeed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;by shear intimidation. An eyewitness who had 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;been interviewed by the FBI and who lives on 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the LI shore recently spoke out, but observed: 
<BR>
<P>&quot;I watched the negative official and press reaction 
<BR>
to the reports by Mr. Salinger which more accurately 
<BR>
describe my observations. I have reasoned that if 
<BR>
Mr. Salinger, who is a former prestigious government 
<BR>
official, could be treated so poorly, what is in store 
<BR>
for me if I speak out. I am concerned for my security 
<BR>
and fear Government reprisal against me for what I 
<BR>
have seen.&quot; See <A HREF="http://twa800.com/pages/eyewitness.html">http://twa800.com/pages/eyewitness.html</A> 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Early on I said that the abuse of Pierre Salinger,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;James Sanders, and of myself by both the major
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;media and the government served primarily to send 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a message to those who may want to speak up, that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if you do speak, you'll be sorry. The testimony 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;above confirmed that theory, since the abuse did 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;intimidate a witness with something important to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;say. A witness I spoke to said that the others 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with him don't want to speak about what they saw
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(<A HREF="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/witness.htm#Runyan">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/witness.htm#Runyan</A>). 
<BR>
<P><P><P><EM>&gt;He said also that had there really been the remotest suspicion of a problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;causing the fuel tank to have exploded, every single 747 throughout the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;world would have been grounded instantly until the problem was either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proven, and then rectified on every plane, or established to be unfounded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This was not the case.  Not one single 747 anywhere was grounded for checks.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Why not?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: They did check wires on many 747s under 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the pretext that frayed wires may have caused 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the fuel tank to explode. However, nobody at 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the NTSB has been able to explain how wires 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;outside the tank could ignite vapors inside 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the tank. The NTSB simulated the alleged 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ignition by placing an igniter inside a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mock-up tank, and even then, to get it to 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;explode they had to add hydrogen and propane 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to the Jet A1 fuel! Clearly, the relationship 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the NTSB's test to reality is about zero.
