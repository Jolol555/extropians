<P>Bio-based microbes will be relatively easy to develop defenses against

<P><EM>&gt; We have no

<P>Relatively easy, just make them smooth on the outside or very sharp.
<BR>
The main line of defenese, antibodies, will only work well on
<BR>
bumpy (proteinoid) surfaces.  Sharp things like asbestos
<BR>
fibers make a mess when the macrophages try to injest them.

<EM>&gt; defenses capable of stopping them.
</EM><BR>
<P>If you can make nanobot attackers, you should be able to make nanobot
<BR>
defenders.  It is probably numbers issue, to launch a good attack, the
<BR>
attackers would have to deliver a significantly greater mass than
<BR>
the defenders.  Over time, people might develop stealth-nanobots
<BR>
(carefully disguised as your own cells?), but there are probably a
<BR>
lot of sensor techniques (optical, acoustic, chemical gradients, etc.)
<BR>
that can be use to spot the imposters, so they can't build up to
<BR>
threatening levels over time.
<BR>
<P>There is an interesting line here though that involves the use of
<BR>
replicating nanobots (Something being carefully avoided in Nanomedicine).
<BR>
If you can design *really* small assemblers and fit them in cell-sized
<BR>
packages and have a internal chemical factory that turns bio-feedstock
<BR>
into diamondoid feedstock, then the only good defense will be an equivalently
<BR>
armed immune system (which minus the diamondoid is what we have now!).
<BR>
The nice thing, is that I doubt there will be a &quot;viral&quot; equivalent in
<BR>
nanobot systems.  At the scales we are talking about, using the materials
<BR>
we are talking about, with the intricate designs we are talking about
<BR>
(with things like encrypted bot-programs), I can't see there being any easy
<BR>
ways (other than security leaks) to &quot;divert&quot; your own nanobots against you.
<BR>
<P>Billy's comments about scales was interesting.  We typically think in
<BR>
terms of threats and responses to things on our scale (people, cars,
<BR>
tanks, etc.).  However it is clear that at the nanoscale and the megascale
<BR>
there are already &quot;wars&quot; going on -- viruses &amp; bacteria against your
<BR>
immune system, and giant gas planets against the comets.  I don't think
<BR>
it gets any different as intelligence moves downscale and upscale.
