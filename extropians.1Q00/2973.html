<BR>
I decided to try to write down some of my reasons for signing up for
<BR>
cryonics after I was caught without a ready explanation a little while
<BR>
back.  I had nonchalantly mentioned being signed up to someone whom I
<BR>
had thought would find it ordinary.  She was surprised, and I was
<BR>
unprepared to defend my choice.
<BR>
<P>It seemed to me that I handled the conversation poorly; I think I gave
<BR>
her the impression at first that I thought it was an easy decision,
<BR>
because I thought it was obvious that cryonics will work.  It isn't
<BR>
obvious, and it's not a simple decision.  But I think the chances are
<BR>
good enough that if you want to live a long life even in an uncertain
<BR>
future, it's a reasonable wager.
<BR>
<P>Please take a look at my explanation at 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://discuss.foresight.org/~hibbert/WhyCryonics.html">http://discuss.foresight.org/~hibbert/WhyCryonics.html</A> and let me
<BR>
know what you think.
