<P>IBM Scientists Discover Nanotech Communication Method 
<BR>
&quot;Quantum mirage&quot; may enable atom-scale circuits 
<BR>
SAN JOSE, Calif. (February 3, 2000) -- IBM scientists have discovered a way 
<BR>
to transport information on the atomic scale that uses the wave nature of 
<BR>
electrons instead of conventional wiring. The new phenomenon, called the 
<BR>
&quot;quantum mirage&quot; effect, may enable data transfer within future nanoscale 
<BR>
electronic circuits too small to use wires. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;This is a fundamentally new way of guiding information through a solid,&quot; 
<BR>
said IBM Fellow Donald M. Eigler, IBM's lead researcher on this project.. &quot;We 
<BR>
call it a mirage because we project information about one atom to another 
<BR>
spot where there is no atom.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>As computer circuit features shrink toward atomic dimensions -- which they 
<BR>
have for decades in accordance with Moore's Law -- the behavior of electrons 
<BR>
changes from being like particles described by classical physics to being 
<BR>
like waves described by quantum mechanics. On such small scales, for example, 
<BR>
tiny wires don't conduct electrons as well as classical theory predicts. So 
<BR>
quantum analogs for many traditional functions must be available if 
<BR>
nanocircuits are to achieve the desired performance advantages of their small 
<BR>
size. 
<BR>
<P>IBM's new quantum mirage technique may prove to be just such a substitute for 
<BR>
the wires connecting nanocircuit components. 
<BR>
<P>The quantum mirage was discovered by three physicists at IBM's Almaden 
<BR>
Research Center here: Hari C. Manoharan, Christopher P. Lutz and Eigler. They 
<BR>
reported their findings in the cover story of the February 3 issue of Nature, 
<BR>
a prestigious international scientific journal published in London. They used 
<BR>
the same low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with which 
<BR>
Eigler and Erhard Schweizer first positioned individual atoms 10 years ago, 
<BR>
spelling out the letters I-B-M with 35 xenon atoms. 
<BR>
<P>To create the quantum mirage, the scientists first moved several dozen cobalt 
<BR>
atoms on a copper surface into an ellipse-shaped ring. As Michael Crommie 
<BR>
(who is now a professor at the University of California-Berkeley), Lutz and 
<BR>
Eigler had shown in 1993, the ring atoms acted as a &quot;quantum corral&quot; -- 
<BR>
reflecting the copper's surface electrons within the ring into a wave pattern 
<BR>
predicted by quantum mechanics. 
<BR>
<P>The size and shape of the elliptical corral determine its &quot;quantum states&quot; -- 
<BR>
the energy and spatial distribution of the confined electrons. The IBM 
<BR>
scientists used a quantum state that concentrated large electron densities at 
<BR>
each focus point of the elliptical corral. When the scientists placed an atom 
<BR>
of magnetic cobalt at one focus, a mirage appeared at the other focus: the 
<BR>
same electronic states in the surface electrons surrounding the cobalt atom 
<BR>
were detected even though no magnetic atom was actually there. The intensity 
<BR>
of the mirage is about one-third of the intensity around the cobalt atom. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;We have become quantum mechanics -- engineering and exploring the properties 
<BR>
of quantum states,&quot; Eigler said. &quot;We're paving the way for the future 
<BR>
nanotechnicians.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The operation of the quantum mirage is similar to how light or sound waves is 
<BR>
focused to a single spot by optical lenses, mirrors, parabolic reflectors or 
<BR>
&quot;whisper spots&quot; in buildings. For example, faint sounds generated at either 
<BR>
of the two &quot;whisper spots&quot; in the Old House of Representatives Chamber (now 
<BR>
called Statuary Hall) in the U.S. Capitol Building in Washington, D.C., can 
<BR>
be heard clearly far across the chamber at the other whisper spot. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;The quantum mirage technique permits us to do some very interesting 
<BR>
scientific experiments such as remotely probing atoms and molecules, studying 
<BR>
the origins of magnetism at the atomic level, and ultimately manipulating 
<BR>
individual electron or nuclear spins,&quot; said Dr. Manoharan. &quot;But we must make 
<BR>
significant improvements before this method becomes useful in actual 
<BR>
circuits. Making each ellipse with the STM is currently impractically slow. 
<BR>
They would have to be easily and rapidly produced, connections to other 
<BR>
components would also have to be devised and a rapid and power-efficient way 
<BR>
to modulate the available quantum states would need to be developed.&quot; 
<BR>
<P>The IBM scientists have built and tested elliptical corrals up to 20 
<BR>
nanometers long with the width as little as half that. (A nanometer is one 
<BR>
billionth of a meter -- about 40 billionths of an inch -- or about the size 
<BR>
of a five atoms placed side-by-side.) The electron density and intensity of 
<BR>
the mirage depends on the quantum state, not the distance between the foci. 
<BR>
<P>IBM Research operates in eight locations worldwide: the Thomas J. Watson 
<BR>
Research Center in Yorktown Heights, NY; the Almaden Research Center in San 
<BR>
Jose, Calif.; the Zurich Research Laboratory in Zurich, Switzerland; the 
<BR>
Tokyo Research Laboratory in Yamato, Japan; the Haifa Research Laboratory in 
<BR>
Haifa, Israel; the China Research Laboratory in Beijing, China, the Austin 
<BR>
Research Laboratory in Austin, Texas, and the India Research Center in Dehli, 
<BR>
India. 
<BR>
<P>IBM Research has long been a leader in studying the properties of materials 
<BR>
important to the information technology industry. In 1981, Gerd Binnig and 
<BR>
Heinrich Rohrer of IBM's Zurich Research Laboratory in Switzerland invented 
<BR>
the scanning tunneling microscope, which enabled scientists to see -- and in 
<BR>
1990, position -- individual atoms. For this achievement, they shared the 
<BR>
1986 Nobel Prize in Physics. In 1984, Binnig co-invented the Atomic Force 
<BR>
Microscope, which led to a variety of new instruments that used various tiny 
<BR>
cantilevers to extend near-atomic resolution imaging to many to many new 
<BR>
forces, including friction and magnetism. IBM's Almaden (San Jose, Calif.), 
<BR>
Watson (Yorktown Heights, N.Y.) and Zurich (Switzerland) laboratories 
<BR>
continue active and complementary nanotechnology research efforts.
