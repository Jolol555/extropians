<EM>&gt;  ZDTV interview
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;Ray Kurzweil was interviewed this week on ZDTV.  Made a number of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;transhumanesqe predictions.  I would move his timeline up a couple years.
</EM><BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;The man has serious credentials.  Far from a loopy fortuneteller with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tarot cards and a crystal ball, Kurzweil has built and sold four
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;successful companies during the past 25 years, and won numerous accolades
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for creating technology to aid the disabled.
</EM><BR>
<P>Strange.  This is apparently a series on &quot;High-tech Thinkers&quot; by a
<BR>
computer industry news service and the journalist feels a need to clarify
<BR>
that her subject is not a fortune-teller.  Do they have to offer this
<BR>
disclaimer every time they ask their visionary guests to offer a few
<BR>
predictions?  Or just when the subject mentions nanotech and advanced AI
<BR>
(and not, say, vitamin-dispensing miniskirts of the year 3000)?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;His omens may seem startling, but Kurzweil sees them as conservative.
</EM><BR>
<P>This use of &quot;omen&quot; does not correspond to any available.  How about
<BR>
&quot;prediction&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;By the year 2099
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - There is no longer any distinction between humans and computers.
</EM><BR>
<P>By the year 2000
<BR>
&nbsp;- There is no longer any distinction between journalism and mush.
<BR>
<P><P>This prediction of mine could certainly have been moved up by a few years.
