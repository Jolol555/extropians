<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, but they are.  While people who are dead may have had an extremely
<BR>
valuable life, the truth is that no new ideas, thoughts, feelings or
<BR>
notions can be evoked from them.  The only thing that keeps such people
<BR>
important is the magnitude of value they once possessed conveyed by those
<BR>
who are currently alive.  Take Heinlein, for instance: famous writer and
<BR>
visionary, but his importance is only cemented by the fact that people
<BR>
still read his writings and convey his values.  This is the sense of
<BR>
&quot;immortality&quot; that most driven people have classically wished to possess.
<BR>
However, if someone such as Heinlein were alive today the continual
<BR>
creation of ideas would make him perpetually or kinetically important,
<BR>
rather than important only in the eyes of his conveyors.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is for this reason, and many others, that I'm shooting for the real
<BR>
immortality --why would I want to be an important part of the past when I
<BR>
could be an eternally kinetic part of the future?
