<EM>&gt; Funny, this very topic came up in a class last night (a class in which I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introduced transhumanism). My vote is for replacing the current system with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a working Foresight Exchange (ideas futures). I suppose you can still have 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one-warm-human-body/one vote, but you'd be voting for representatives who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have to take into account the results of the Foresight Exchange.
</EM><BR>
<P>Idea Futures are good for predictions of future events.  They can also
<BR>
provide conditional predictions (e.g., what will the murder rate be if we
<BR>
do/don't have gun control?).  But by itself this doesn't let you choose
<BR>
policies or say what is the &quot;right&quot; decision in any particular situation.
<BR>
Should we raise or lower taxes?  What should the criteria be?  Greater
<BR>
income equality?  Higher economic growth?  Greatest average income for
<BR>
the poorest 20%?  The choice of what values should govern decisions will
<BR>
remain a political matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Any 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas on how, constitutionally, you could force the representatives to use 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Exchange results in their legislation? If we could get the idea futures 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; process widely accepted, it would tend to put pressure on legislators to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; follow it (especially if you could easily go on the web and check a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; representatives voting record against the ideas market's recommendations). 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think this would have to be a change which was voluntarily adopted.
<BR>
For example, the CBO could be required by the legislature to use IF
<BR>
predictions as the basis for their forecasts.  The voters would have to
<BR>
elect representatives who would put these policies into place.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But it would be good if there were a way of compelling reps to follow 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this--and a good democratic argument can be made that this would mean a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more pure form of democracy in the sense of following the informed will of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the people. (Given how much Americans love to gamble, I suspect that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; participation rates would be higher than we see in many elections too.)
</EM><BR>
<P>It sounds like you may be thinking of an IF claim like &quot;Should we raise
<BR>
taxes?&quot;  I'm not sure how this would work, what basis people would have
<BR>
for valuing the claim.  It seems more like traditional voting than IF.
