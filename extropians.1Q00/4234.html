Eternity tending gardens on bended knee worshipping their deity, no worries,

no woes, need something just wish it into existence! I want problems to 
<BR>
solve! If eternity were too easy I would be bored to insanity! I would beg 
<BR>
for oblivion!
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I can understand the frustration of visualizing such a Heaven.  You are not 
<BR>
the only one who has thought this.  I remember once a speaker in the Mormon 
<BR>
church who spoke on the nature of Heaven.  He said a prominent Protestant 
<BR>
minister said in a sermon how when he died he wanted to hug his wife and 
<BR>
then spend the next ten million years looking at and worshipping God and 
<BR>
doing nothing more.  Then he would turn to his wife and hug her, to be 
<BR>
followed by ten million more years of looking at and worshipping God!
<BR>
<P>This Mormon speaker said he felt God would have better things for him to do 
<BR>
then that!  Like paying more attention to his wife! lol!  I have always 
<BR>
liked the Mormon view of Heaven, which is in a theological sense similar to 
<BR>
extropianism.
<BR>
<P>The view is that those who live for God and are sealed in their marriages 
<BR>
for all time and eternity will eventually in the next life become gods.  
<BR>
They will create worlds and have children to people them.  Their offspring 
<BR>
will in turn be tested to see if they will live in a way to allow them to be 
<BR>
worthy to become gods and repeat the divine cycle.
<BR>
<P>And those who did not get the chance to hear the gospel in this life will 
<BR>
get the chance in the next, with no blessings lost.  Only those who felt the 
<BR>
spirit of God in hearing the message in this life and then rejected it will 
<BR>
lose opportunities.
<BR>
<P>&quot;As God once is, man may become.  As man is, God once was.&quot;  This is a very 
<BR>
popular couplet in the Mormon faith.  This is often villified though, and 
<BR>
seen as blasphemous within the evangelical realm.  In the Doctrine and 
<BR>
Covenants (Mormon scripture) there is the saying that, &quot;the same sociality 
<BR>
that exists here will exist in the next life but coupled with eternal glory&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So the best of this life will continue on.  It would be a life of ever 
<BR>
expanding ties of family and friends with the goal of bestowing divine power 
<BR>
upon one's worthy progeny.
<BR>
<P>I realize there are obvious and vast differences between Mormon and 
<BR>
extropian thought.  But I do like the similarities.  It will be interesting 
<BR>
to see how Mormon doctrine and practice develop over the coming century with 
<BR>
the technological transformations that are coming.
<BR>
I want to be around to see these things happen.
<BR>
<P>best wishes to all,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
