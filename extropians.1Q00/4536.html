<EM>&gt; &gt; ....collect every stupid thing that person ever posted, ever, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; searching
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thru achives, etc.  Does this change the way we post?  spike

<EM>&gt; I was more boisterous and silly in some of my Usenet posts before the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advent of Dejanews....
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, Ive an idea.  We can intentionally corrupt the never-forgetting
<BR>
permanent internet database with a little game: we can declare a
<BR>
specific day for writing parodies of each other and posting them.
<BR>
Then at any time in the future, if Dan F. asks &quot;do you deny having
<BR>
written the following...&quot; then we must truthfully answer, I dont know,
<BR>
let me see it.  This scheme will provide truthful deniability, forever.
<BR>
<P>Heres how it works.  Since April fools day is coming up and extropians
<BR>
do everything a little more than others, let us declare Sunday 2 April
<BR>
extro fools day.  On that day we pick our favorite extropian(s), write
<BR>
a parody of their posts, immitating their style, etc, preferably with
<BR>
a comic twist.  We send that person the parody at which time, if
<BR>
they are in a playful mood, they post as is, or modify, etc.
<BR>
<P>Ill give you an example of what I have in mind.  I send Eliezer the
<BR>
following:
<BR>
<P>Eliezer may or may not have written the following:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Extropian friends, it has occurred to me that I am running out of
<BR>
time for making those fondly regretted memories of foolish things
<BR>
done during my misspent youth.  I have found that my elders
<BR>
(e.g. Everyone) always get a wry smile while recalling some long
<BR>
repented-of incident from their wild days.
<BR>
<P>I have decided to have a wild misspent youth, but I am constrained
<BR>
to use only one day on this endevour (the Singularity waits, you know)
<BR>
and so I solicit your ideas.  How shall I generate all those fond memories
<BR>
of youthful indiscretion under these time constraints?  Eliezer&quot;
<BR>
<P>etc.  Then I send this to Eliezer on April 2, if he decides it is
<BR>
sufficiently Eliezerlike, he posts it under his own name.  Everyone
<BR>
does this.  For all eternity thereafter, just because something is
<BR>
posted under your name does not mean you wrote it.  spike
