Hi--Yes, I'm a newbie, hope it's OK--
<BR>
<P>I think that the three little pigs story should possibly be conditionally changed, at least on the condition that the piglet with the brick house is unaware of the other two being eaten for building the crappy HUD style abodes. If the 3rd piglet was aware of his brothers' folly and still let them die without offering help, then they should bring him up on &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; charges. They might also charge him with violating bacon-producer's price-control agreements as well as quite a few FDA standards on the consumable quality of Pork products.
<BR>
<P>Does anybody know about any substantial news or developments with cryogenic freezing processes? I heard that they were working on improving the whole &quot;anti-freeze&quot; concept a little more, but I don't know if it's going anywhere.
