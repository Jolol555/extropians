<EM>&gt; The REAL Definition of &quot;IS&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, most people have heard this quote out of context.  The way this
<BR>
sound bite was spread around, it sounds ludicrous..  The actual
<BR>
interrogation was much more logical and lawyerly legalistic.  Not to defend
<BR>
Clinton, but just to provide &quot;the rest of the story....&quot;.  (These are gross
<BR>
paraphrases from my memory, not real quotes, but the meaning is the same.)
<BR>
<P>Prosecutor:  From the previous court transcript, you were asked &quot;Is there
<BR>
any affair with Ms. Lewinski?&quot;  To which you answered, &quot;No, there is no
<BR>
affair with Ms. Lewinski.&quot;  In a later deposition, when reviewing that same
<BR>
question,  you admitted that there was an affair at one time with Ms.
<BR>
Lewinski.  Doesn't this prove that you committed perjury, and didn't you
<BR>
admit to it while under oath to tell the truth?
<BR>
<P>President:  Not at all.  The answer to the question depends on what the
<BR>
definition of the word &quot;is&quot; is.  If you take the word to mean its proper
<BR>
English meaning of present-tense existence, then my answer was correct.  At
<BR>
the time the question was first asked, my involvement with Ms. Lewinski had
<BR>
long been terminated.  I could not say &quot;There is an affair&quot;, because that
<BR>
would have been untrue.  I could only say &quot;There was an affair&quot;.  That would
<BR>
have been true, but that question was never asked.
<BR>
<P>Prosecutor:  Weren't you sworn to tell the truth, including the whole truth?
<BR>
<P>President:  Yes, but only in response to questions asked of me.  No
<BR>
defendant is required under law to answer questions that have not been
<BR>
asked.
<BR>
<P>Prosecutor:  Then why did you expand your answer to admit to an earlier
<BR>
affair when you were asked the identical question at a later deposition?
<BR>
<P>President:  The question was reinterpreted.  Although the question was read
<BR>
out of the prior transcript so that it would be the same question again, I
<BR>
was instructed to interpret the word &quot;is&quot; to also include all past-tense
<BR>
occurrences as well.  This was a different interpretation of the question,
<BR>
since I had not previously interpreted the word &quot;is&quot; to be a past-tense
<BR>
verb.  The reinterpreted question now asked if I currently had or ever
<BR>
previously had an affair with Ms. Lewinski.  I answered that question
<BR>
truthfully.  I said &quot;At one time there was an affair with Ms. Lewinski.
<BR>
Presently, there is no affair with Ms. Lewinski.&quot;  Both answers were
<BR>
truthful and complete.  The change was in the redefinition of the question,
<BR>
not in a redefinition of my answer.
