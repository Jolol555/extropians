<P>These points appear to relate to the question why anyone would set up free
<BR>
street corner food and clothing compilers (say) after the fashion of
<BR>
DIAMOND AGE *give that* nanoassembly is already up and running. Actually,
<BR>
the trajectory of likely development suggests to me that this might be a
<BR>
brief transitional period before *everyone* owns an anything box. (Unless
<BR>
that is centrally prohibited as far too risky to the health of the planet.)
<BR>
<P>I still wonder about the steps to early and effective nano. In brief, I
<BR>
suspect something like Eric Raymond's gift economy theories (primarily
<BR>
relevant to open source code) will generate a lot of the software needed to
<BR>
compile many goods, given an industrially-initiated molecular assembler. (I
<BR>
suggested this in print, or something like it, back around 1969, BTW.)
<BR>
However, there's still doubt in some people's minds about the economics of
<BR>
creating an industrial base for nano mints. 
<BR>
<P>It's like saying in 1880 `We'll have these horseless carriages in the 24th
<BR>
century and every family will be able to afford them, and they will first
<BR>
be designed and built and distributed by wealthy landowning philanthropists
<BR>
and hobbyists.' Hmm, for all I know, the key first steps to cars *were*
<BR>
taken by just such people. Hmm. Even so, it's generally agreed that, unlike
<BR>
tinkering a crystal set or even a crude motorized car in the garage,
<BR>
*shitloads* of $$$ will be needed to make the first desktop matter
<BR>
compiler. Then you've got one, and where's your future profit? Remember,
<BR>
open source only works if your income stream comes from *service*.
