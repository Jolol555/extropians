<EM> &gt;     &gt;Each of us exists AT THE PRESENT  MOMENT as a unique physical
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;     &gt;construction of atoms.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; That happens to be true, but it expresses no profound truth, it's just 
</EM><BR>
an accident
<BR>
<EM> &gt; of history. No reason to expect it always to be true.
</EM><BR>
<P>The truth expressed here is sufficiently profound that you missed it
<BR>
entirely.  I did not mean that we each exist now as a unique physical
<BR>
construction of atoms, but might at some future time exist as something
<BR>
else.  I meant that the meaning of the phrase &quot;our existence as persons&quot;
<BR>
is absolutely unambigous ONLY in reference to the existence of our unique
<BR>
bodies AT THIS TIME, and any attempt to extend this to an existence
<BR>
extended in time as a &quot;unique individual&quot; is problematic.  The claim that
<BR>
&quot;I am one person who is living one life&quot; is sufficiently well-justified in
<BR>
terms of physical facts as long as you don't start messing with Xeroxes or
<BR>
uploads.  However, there is no way you can extend this to the latter
<BR>
cases, without opening the door to all kinds of paradoxes and ambiguities
<BR>
which make it clear that the claim, to the extent that it modifies a bare
<BR>
description of physical facts, is either meaningless, or false.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;     &gt; It is possible to say this, but that does not make it 
</EM><BR>
unambiguous.  For
<BR>
<EM> &gt;     &gt;example, what if you make two copies simultaneously? Which one,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;     &gt;then is &quot;you&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Only one way to tell, ask them. I'll bet you already know what they'll say.
</EM><BR>
<P>They will both claim to be the original person.  Which shows that the
<BR>
claims of either one are either false or meaningless (I say the latter).
<BR>
Ditto if only one copy is made.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Your entire paragraph of rhetorical questions, that I'll reframe from 
</EM><BR>
quoting,
<BR>
<EM> &gt; can be answered if you just stop thinking of yourself as a noun. You are
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; an adjective, an adjective modifying matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am not an noun or an adjective, I am a human being, and human beings are
<BR>
physical objects, made of matter.  Show me a counterexample if you differ.
