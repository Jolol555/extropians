<P><EM>&gt; The big problem I always had with the Gaia idea is that organisms can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; control their internal environmens only because they have evolved this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability over many generations.  Early organisms were probably bad at it,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but those which were slightly better survived and reproduced, and over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time the ability improved.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, it is pretty clear that it is valid to the degree that the
<BR>
organisms convert the CO2 to O2 (because they want the carbon).
<BR>
The C gets bound to Ca (because CaCO3 is a good shell (defense)
<BR>
when you can't make SiC or diamond).  The planet itself through
<BR>
plate tectonics seems to be the fundamental recycler of the
<BR>
C by converting it back into CO2 released by the volcanoes.
<BR>
Of course as Rare Earth does discuss there are numerous
<BR>
ways for this to get messed up.  It would be interesting
<BR>
to know how many living organisms, the average C atom has
<BR>
been through at this point.
<BR>
<P>It turns out Rare Earth does have a chapter on Snowball Earth.
<BR>
They also touch briefly on the possibility that &quot;extinction&quot;
<BR>
events might be good for organisms if there are many species
<BR>
in a phyla (high diversity) since if even a few species can
<BR>
survive the event, they can rapidly repopulate the empty
<BR>
environmental niches.  One thing that seems clear is that
<BR>
that evolution starts slow and seems to speed up over time.
<BR>
For example, bacterial &quot;sex&quot; seems to be much less effective
<BR>
than higher order sex, because less genetic material is shuffled.
<BR>
An interesting idea is that retroviruses and gene shuffling
<BR>
may have arisen in response to extinction events.  They
<BR>
allow nature to adapt to high stress situations and readapt
<BR>
more quickly to emptied niches.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I find myself leaning towards the view that we simply got very,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very lucky.  Life's survival on earth was an incredible fluke, a one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in a trillion chance.  Most planets kill off their life before it gets
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this far.
</EM><BR>
<P>They don't say that in Rare Earth.  They say that primitive life
<BR>
is likely to be very abundant.  The evidence would seem to suggest
<BR>
that life keeps getting knocked down to its knees over and over
<BR>
again.  But to my mind, that is just a recipe for nature developing
<BR>
the genetics that let it climb back up faster and faster after
<BR>
each knock-down.  Once you develop a machine that is useful
<BR>
(be it antifreeze proteins, crocodillins, reverse transcriptase,
<BR>
etc.) unless you entirely wipe out the phyla it is going to
<BR>
around for use during the next climb out of the pit.
<BR>
<P>Rare Earth cites 5 major extinction events since the Cambrian breakout.
<BR>
Only one, the C/T meteor/comet can be pinned on astrophenomena.
<BR>
They also say that estimates for planet sterilization events
<BR>
have been estimated at 1 in 2 billion years.  So we may be overdue.
<BR>
Conversely 2 billion years seems to be more than enough to be enough
<BR>
time to evolve from bacteria to intelligent life.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly they point out that events like the Tunguska event
<BR>
in Siberia in 1908 may occur roughly every century.  So if we
<BR>
solve the longevity problem and get average spans of 2000 years
<BR>
you have a significant probability of living to see one of these
<BR>
in relatively close proximity.  Now if they can only get them
<BR>
timed for 4th of July, that would be really cool.
