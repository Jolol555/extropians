Africa is dying, but it isn't AIDS, it isn't dying of famine or wars. It is 
<BR>
dying of politics. When the colonial powers left Africa, they had installed 
<BR>
huge bureaucratic systems, while commerce was either in the form of huge 
<BR>
corporations (like the plantations) and small scale tradesmen. The only ways 
<BR>
open to success in African societies were either to become a politician or a 
<BR>
military. A politician could control peoples lives and rule over the only 
<BR>
existing institution: the state. Tribalism started to flourish since control 
<BR>
of the state was the only option for survival, and then it quickly bogged 
<BR>
down into coup d'etats. The generalissmo became the only viable option for 
<BR>
people that wanted to make a career, to control the shrinking state.
<BR>
<P>Have you noticed that most First World businesses in Africa are mines, oil 
<BR>
fields and such natural resource gatherers? Why aren't there any computer 
<BR>
business in Libreville or toy manifacturers in Kampala? They should be 
<BR>
lining up according to the &quot;social dumping&quot;  preachers (no wages, no social 
<BR>
benefits)? Well then you would have to deal with African society, and that 
<BR>
is chaos, snatchocracy and corruption in the extreme. All your prospective 
<BR>
African business partners WILL try to trick you (apologies to all honest 
<BR>
African businesses, but you are very few indeed), and worst of all you'll 
<BR>
have to get into contact with the local government on a regular basis, a 
<BR>
government that thinks that a private industry only exists to be bled by 
<BR>
them so they can gather resources for their civil wars.
<BR>
<P>Read the Frazier report on the economic freedom of 119 of the world's 
<BR>
nations and territories. Africa made quite dismal reading.
