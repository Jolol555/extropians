<P>
<EM>&gt; Rob responds:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether it's &quot;true by definition&quot; or whatever else is not relevant to my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point.
</EM><BR>
<P>As you say.  In that case, I fully concede that qualia
<BR>
fuckingexistsandso'syourmother.  Now.  Does science have anything to tell
<BR>
us about this predicate?  Now that we've all come into agreement that all
<BR>
qualia have this property, have we agreed to anything other than a name to
<BR>
call it?
<BR>
<P>Sorry, I'm being a little glib here.  The problem is this.  If the
<BR>
predicate holds by definition, then I can't contest it, but it's also very
<BR>
restricted in terms of its effect.  Definitions can't change facts, they
<BR>
just change the words we use to refer to the world.  I could say that all
<BR>
unicorns beautifulexist and that God exfaithists, and so long as I
<BR>
restricted my claims to definitions, then I can't make a false claim: all
<BR>
unicorns DO beautifulexist, since &quot;beautifulexist&quot; just means whatever
<BR>
property it is that fits of unicorns.
<BR>
<P>Definitions are a call for translational charity (in the Quinean sense);
<BR>
by making a definition, I'm necessarily right about whatever it is I'm
<BR>
talking about, because I'm changing the meaning of my words to be whatever
<BR>
it is they're true about.
<BR>
<P>So if qualia existmotherfucker by definition, then I can agree to it
<BR>
without weakening my claim in the slightest that qualia don't exist.
<BR>
<P>More to the point, if this is your move to attempt to demonstrate how
<BR>
qualia are debatable after all, I take it to have failed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I'm merely pointing out that someone somewhere observed what is known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as qualia, and labelled it such. If IT doesn't compute according to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current paradigm, that's just tough, the paradigm will have to shift. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; originally noted effect will never go away, regardless of any attempts to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get the fly out of the ointment.
</EM><BR>
<P>What if the effect is just &quot;people saying they have qualia?&quot;  How does
<BR>
this argument differ from the &quot;Well, I Appear to have qualia...&quot; argument,
<BR>
which is totally undebatable?  (Not that it's uncontroversial, or even
<BR>
right, just undebatable.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I do realise that effects such as consciousness are extraordinary from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the perspective of empirical science, but this method is not the only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one available - sometimes one just has to accept that it's just a tool
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; - the true discoveries, that is, the ideas that guide the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; implementation of the empirical method, come from good old fashioned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophising.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah!  Go team!  Now, where do we begin?
<BR>
<P>Hmmm...
<BR>
<P>What were we looking for, again?
<BR>
