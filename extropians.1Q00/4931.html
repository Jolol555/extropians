<P>That is interesting information.  So the pressure will be on for Eli
<BR>
in May.  Even in disguise, I think we will recognize the memes
<BR>
unless he is totally silent (and somehow I don't expect that to
<BR>
be the case...)  :-)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure, it's cheery to mention each other in such glowing terms, but it might 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be preferable to see some code that does something in the world, or to make 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the world jump up and down waving dollar bills, before we assume that one 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of our number is the new Knuth.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not so much &quot;glowing terms&quot; as respect for education in an area where
<BR>
you know the waters are deep and I might sink before I swim.  Now
<BR>
at the Contact conference, both Minsky and Lenat gave presentations
<BR>
and they seem to be of a similar mind.  (I.e. you have to think
<BR>
*really* hard about representations, heuristics and algorithims
<BR>
to do AI and that most &quot;current&quot; AI research (ala robotic dogs and
<BR>
facial expressions) was in no way going to advance the field.)
<BR>
<P>One thing that seems clear is that once the &quot;robotics&quot; aspects of
<BR>
the brain get encoded into $6.00 chips (ala the recent vision-tracking
<BR>
chip), the only thing left for the researchers will be to return 
<BR>
to the difficult parts of AI (knowledge representation, algorithms
<BR>
that actually produce decent results, etc.).
<BR>
<P>Now, setting aside that debate (please), I will simply offer the
<BR>
comment that both individuals showed examples of how damn complex
<BR>
human &quot;intelligence&quot; really is.  It isn't a single algorithm or
<BR>
method that gets us over, its a grab-bag of alternatives that
<BR>
we can use when one or more methods is utterly insufficient.
<BR>
<P>Lenat did offer an interesting example where Cyc could come up
<BR>
with an answer to a question that stumped the collective experts at an
<BR>
&quot;unnamed&quot; agency.  [The questions involved the breakout of war in the Mideast
<BR>
and the impact of blockades on the shipping/delivery of oil supplies.]
<BR>
It seemed to me that the essence of the solution consisted
<BR>
of two parts (a) having access to a very wide information base;
<BR>
and (b) having a logical reasoning process that exceeds typical
<BR>
human abilities.  [E.g. the reasoning to solve Fermant's Last
<BR>
Theorem that involved both a very wide information base and the
<BR>
ability to connect very diverse areas of thought.]
<BR>
<P>Now what Lenat did not show was what fraction of the questions
<BR>
whare Cyc did not come up to the level of human conclusions.  Still,
<BR>
one has to bear in mind that computers are still slow and Lenat
<BR>
has not had the &quot;unlimited&quot; budget that nature has had.
