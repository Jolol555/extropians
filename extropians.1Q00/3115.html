1)      On the topic of being kicked out of my confirmation class, it wasn't 
<BR>
just me, just a few weeks prior, my good friend got kicked out because he was 
<BR>
wearing a Bad Religion shirt. And the summer before that, I wasn't allowed 
<BR>
into me step mom's church because my pants were to wide around the ankles and 
<BR>
the pockets were to big.  They thought that I might steal from the collection 
<BR>
plates.
<BR>
<P>2)      Every time I go to a church, except the one I'm going to now 
<BR>
(Unitarians rock!!) I have been told I'm going to hell.  You know what I say? 
<BR>
&nbsp;If I'm going to hell, I may as well drive the bus there!!
