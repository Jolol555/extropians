<P>I didn't see _The 13th Floor_, but I did see _The Matrix_. Fun enough,
<BR>
now if only The Matrix's entire plot could have fulfilled its initial
<BR>
promise of conspiracies, intrigues and plot twists. Instead, we got
<BR>
virtual martial arts masters dodging bullets, with only the flashiness
<BR>
of the special effects to save the movie from being another _Johnny
<BR>
Mnemonic_ style dud. Say, when it comes to people dodging bullets, does
<BR>
anyone remember how they played this in the old _New Avengers_ TV series
<BR>
-- now, *there* was a show that could mix fantasy silliness with
<BR>
surprising bits of realism! You can bet that super agent John Steed was
<BR>
able to arrange a big &quot;surprise&quot; for the bullet dodging Russian guy in
<BR>
one episode of *that* show, hehe.
<BR>
<P>As for fixing _The Matrix_' plot, it's not hard to imagine that the
<BR>
&quot;real&quot; world of Morpheus and his heroes could have turned out to be just
<BR>
as much unreal as the Matrix itself, or maybe even *less* real. I
<BR>
presume that poor Morpheus would have been genuinely fooled. That seems
<BR>
like a better emotional setup for the audience, if the most central
<BR>
characters are fooled as much as the viewers, while if anyone would know
<BR>
the actual truth it would have to be the mysterious, seldom seen Oracle.
<BR>
Notice that when the freedom fighter heroes got killed in the Matrix,
<BR>
they automatically died in the &quot;real&quot; world, kinda strange, unless of
<BR>
course, Morpheus's world wasn't the real one after all. If you want to
<BR>
toss some technical content into this, say that Morpheus' world was just
<BR>
an encrypted patch or hidden module in the Matrix wiring diagram. The
<BR>
freedom fighters would then be exposing their software selves every time
<BR>
they re-entered the Matrix proper, or something like that. As for why,
<BR>
how about the Matrix as a study session in psycho-history, a misguided
<BR>
effort to save the *real* real world *before* some final collapse or
<BR>
catastrophe? On second thought, nah, that'd never be Hollywood enough,
<BR>
look for more &quot;copper tops&quot; in any coming sequel . . .
