&nbsp;I think that particular scenario will be a self limiting problem.  When
<BR>
&nbsp;model types are a dime a dozen, they lose their appeal, both as a
<BR>
&nbsp;&quot;fashion statement&quot; and as a sex partner.  If everybody looks the same,
<BR>
&nbsp;the ones who get all the attention will be the ones that look different,
<BR>
&nbsp;exotic... intriguing...&gt;&gt;&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I hope so. I truly do, but may I remind you that when it's a &quot;street&quot; fashion 
<BR>
(like tattoos) ii's intriguing, and gets attention, BUT it is usually 
<BR>
considered too daring for most. Only the fringe elements: gangsters, hoodlums 
<BR>
and artists (and the first transhumans?) will wear anything radical at first. 
<BR>
99% people DO want to look the same and fit in, *not* to get attention based 
<BR>
on uniqueness. Their choice (looks, car, etc.) is made by judging how &quot;cool&quot; 
<BR>
they are in the current trend. 
<BR>
<P>Even within the street gangs and hipster cults there's a HUGE element of 
<BR>
sameness. Look at the hipster/rockabilly, punk or Gangsta looks, all have 
<BR>
rules, all have conformity now as their base. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And:
<BR>
If a street &quot;look&quot; catches on in Mainstream America, it has long before been 
<BR>
watered down to the point of boring, sedate, sameness. It isn't until 
<BR>
&quot;everyone's doing it&quot; that it becomes fashion. By then it's pabulum. Fed to 
<BR>
the masses for mass consumption.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Eventually, everyone will want a &quot;unique&quot; look.  Body mod designer
<BR>
&nbsp;houses will spring up to fill the gap... and like the fashion industry
<BR>
&nbsp;today, their biggest successes will come from commercial interpretations
<BR>
&nbsp;of &quot;street&quot; fashions.&gt;&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You said it yourself: &quot;commercial&quot; interpretations. Packaging. Marketing. 
<BR>
This is what we are responding to when we, as a trend, grab onto a particular 
<BR>
look, not the uniqueness of it. God forbid we should do something &quot;uncool&quot; 
<BR>
and look foolish.
<BR>
<P><P>&lt;&lt; Perfect &quot;model&quot; looks will become the sign of a person who lacks taste
<BR>
&nbsp;or isn't able to afford the good stuff. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Yeah except in the world of cars, and in fashion, this tasteless lemming 
<BR>
formula has been already been proven time and time again. Money is no object 
<BR>
when it comes to selecting the largest and most expansive S.U.V.'s , and they 
<BR>
are in incredibly bad taste when driven in a crowded city setting, yet our 
<BR>
streets and parking lots are full of them. Being &quot;perfect&quot; is merely doing 
<BR>
what others do, but more of it and bigger.
<BR>
<P><P>Harleys ceased being cool when all the lawyers and accountants bought them.
<BR>
Body art has now become cliche and housewives and business women sport roses 
<BR>
on their asses. I see them at the spa on lawyers and professionals. Los 
<BR>
Angeles is now suddenly sprouting full-lower-back flower tattoos. I am 
<BR>
grinning when I think of all these chicks thirty years from now all wearing 
<BR>
hip huggers to show off their tats at sixty years old, and people will say 
<BR>
&quot;Look! She's stuck in the nineties&quot;.
