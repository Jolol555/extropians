<P>&lt;&lt; Both statements point at the same phenomenon (have the same denotation)
<BR>
&nbsp;but may generate different emotional overtones, subjective interpretations,
<BR>
&nbsp;socio-cultural values, and ideological assumptions in humans reading them
<BR>
&nbsp;(have different connotations). &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Yes, indeed, each person comes with a lot of pre-formed concepts, wide range 
<BR>
of experience! Good point, interpretations vary highly!! The trick is to be 
<BR>
aware and avoid miscommunication!
<BR>
<P>I think you are talking about a wonderful skill called &quot;Interpersonal 
<BR>
Communications&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt; 
<BR>
&nbsp;Extropians should learn to avoid the connotational traps, so they can
<BR>
&nbsp;infect the optimum number of humans with their Extropian ideas.
<BR>
<EM>  &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Not only that, but &quot;Extropians&quot; can (and should) have varied ideas. 
<BR>
Convincing someone else of my ideas is not my idea ; ) of a pleasant debate. 
<BR>
I have said this before and I will say it again. I go into conversation to 
<BR>
learn, to think, and to express myself. Not to &quot;infect&quot; people. 
<BR>
<P>I also believe have a good Meme Immune System. It is insulting to tell me 
<BR>
otherwise. Even if it was true, one would have to start out presenting ones 
<BR>
ideas first, exposing some of the flaws in my perceptions, and carefully and 
<BR>
kindly (perhaps with humor or loving ways) - finally allowing me to see it 
<BR>
for myself.  
<BR>
Listen: 
<BR>
I look at the source of the idea, the ideas *behind the idea* so to speak. 
<BR>
<P>It is not inappropriate to judge the character of the person giving the idea, 
<BR>
as well as the so called &quot;rationale&quot; behind it. If I find that a person's 
<BR>
thinking is rude, rigid, uninformed, or perhaps just unskilled at 
<BR>
&quot;interpersonal communications&quot; I will think that they are not a good source 
<BR>
-- or that their argument is based on personal bias. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
No matter how well they argue, it will be harder for them to 'convince' me.
