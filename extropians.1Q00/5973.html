Are there any web sites out there for people who share our vision of 
<BR>
technology, but who don't share our political vision -- and who are what we 
<BR>
would classify as fascists or something along those lines? Sort of like the 
<BR>
skinheads, only pro-techno progress, life extension, space colonization, 
<BR>
nanotechnology?
<BR>
<P>I also know there are a wide variety of political views among transhumanists 
<BR>
and Extropians, but I don't think anyone fits into the latter category.)  
<BR>
Merely curious.

<P>Racist transhumanists?  I have found such a group with a list, though the 
<BR>
membership is small, thankfully.  They prefer to call themselves 'racialist' 
<BR>
and not 'racist.' lol!  I grew tired of arguing with them.  Not all list 
<BR>
members there are racist and so they have had some real flamewars.
