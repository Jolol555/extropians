<P>Well, I can see some of us haven't been keeping up with what's happening on
<BR>
the other side of the fence.
<BR>
<P>The DCOM standard is pretty much comparable to CORBA or JavaBeans -
<BR>
preferences between them will have more to do with personal taste and
<BR>
OS/language ideology than anything real.  However, there is a *lot* more to
<BR>
COM+ than just DCOM.
<BR>
<P>First off, you get a run-time environment for your components (this used to
<BR>
be called MTS) that handles all your cross-process communications and
<BR>
networking issues for you.  It also does component pooling (so thousands of
<BR>
clients can share  a few hundred component instances), connection pooling
<BR>
(so hundreds of components can share a few dozen database connections), and
<BR>
distributed transaction management (so components can participate in
<BR>
transactions that span multiple applications and multiple database servers).
<BR>
All of these features are automated to the point that you can actually use
<BR>
them in VB code, and the most complicated thing the component programmer
<BR>
ever has to do is invoke a 'commit/roll back transaction' method.
<BR>
<P>Also, the system is very tightly integrated with lots of neat OS features.
<BR>
You get dynamic load balancing across an arbitrary number of servers without
<BR>
any programming, you can invoke components from scripting code on a web
<BR>
server, you can configure security on components the same way you would
<BR>
secure a file, etc.
<BR>
<P>Plus, they give you all that automation without preventing you from doing
<BR>
things a different way.  I can write a quick VB component if their
<BR>
automation does what I want (which it generally does), or I can write it in
<BR>
C++ and build my own resource dispensers, do security checks
<BR>
programmatically, control how the component is pooled, and so on.
<BR>
<P>As for Eugene's performance questions, the answers are yes.  COM+ on Windows
<BR>
2000 delivers the same high stability, fast performance and high
<BR>
availability as competing Unix-based standards.  It also offers much better
<BR>
scalability than most offerings, thanks to that dynamic load balancing
<BR>
feature. I've even implemented a couple of components that let you make
<BR>
major changes to the database while the system is running.
<BR>
<P>Now, I'll readily concede that this isn't what you want to use for
<BR>
high-performance scientific simulations, but that's because what you want
<BR>
there is a naked CPU and a bunch of hand-coded assembler.  For anything else
<BR>
(and in particular, for the database-oriented apps that constitute the vast
<BR>
majority of business software) there is nothing around that is comparable.
