I'll second that... my mom walked into the room as I was cruising my 
<BR>
inbox...fortunately I managed to switch to another folder before she saw the 
<BR>
subject line 'hot sex'...but that was still a trifle...close.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Whew!  Closecall!  Just explain to her about the list if she comments.
<BR>
<P>Other subject headings I have thought of are...
<BR>
<P>&quot;get your hot steamy sex right here!&quot;
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>&quot;God's wrath is upon this list for the wickedness of it's members!&quot;
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>&quot;DO NOT let your parents read this!!&quot;
<BR>
<P>and
<BR>
<P>&quot;Sasha says, &quot;talk to your kid's about masturbation!&quot;
<BR>
<P>(Sasha, if you were ever put in charge of national public service 
<BR>
announcements, you would make Jocelyn Elders, the former surgeon general, 
<BR>
seem boring by comparison!)
<BR>
<P>Maybe Max should make one of his public service announcements among us and 
<BR>
let us know that young impressionable extropian minds need mature examples.  
<BR>
Hey, I'm working on it!
<BR>
<P>One reason I enjoy this list is because we can kid around but keep it fairly 
<BR>
clean.
<BR>
<P>best regards,
<BR>
