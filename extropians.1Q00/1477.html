<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Aargh - I just worked out what was going wrong in this exchange:
</EM><BR>
[...]
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Damien (not fluent in American)
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Don't be too hard on yourself, Damien! Sometimes, someone may not even
<BR>
think that English is your native tongue!
<BR>
<P>Late last Fall, I received a referee comment on my big paper,
<BR>
(that comes out of part of my thesis):
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;The English, while clear, is a little awkward in a few
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;places, and would benefit from proofreading by a native
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;English speaker.&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>Imagine the crushing blow...! Not only because English _is_ my
<BR>
native language, but in addition, I've been actively practicing my
<BR>
science journalist writing skills for the last decade, and now
<BR>
consider myself to be somewhat of a science journalist.
<BR>
<P>What could I say to comment like that? The best I could do was
<BR>
find some humor in the whole ego-crushing experience, and
<BR>
so, I said the following in my response:
<BR>
<P>------
<BR>
&quot;I (Amara) _am_ a native English speaker, the only native English
<BR>
speaker out of the author list, actually. Perhaps my California
<BR>
roots lend to my speech sounding foreign (as California is
<BR>
considered by many Americans to be like a foreign country).
<BR>
<P>I proof-read our paper, and I edited it to read as smoothly as
<BR>
possible, given the English that I know.&quot;
<BR>
-------
<BR>
<P>Some of my co-authors were scratching their heads trying to figure
<BR>
out what this referee was talking about, and they began to conclude
<BR>
that perhaps this referee wanted me to get a &quot;true&quot; native English
<BR>
speaker to proof-read my paper -- that is, a proof-reader from England!
<BR>
<P>I have to say that this referee's comment and the upheaval to my
<BR>
sense-of-self turned my rather grinding
<BR>
editing/writing/calculating/time-sink paper into a big humorous
<BR>
experience. Years from now, when this paper is at the bottom of my
<BR>
dust-heap of science papers, I will remember this particular paper
<BR>
most by this one referee's comment.
<BR>
<P>------
<BR>
<P>By the way, a couple of years ago I discovered a really interesting
<BR>
and entertaining book about the English language. You might like
<BR>
