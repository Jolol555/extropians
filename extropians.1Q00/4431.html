<EM>&gt; Oh, I'm sure there's a way round it. Just figure out how to convince

<EM>&gt; him that it's unclean -- you can manufacture pork in it, for example.

<EM>&gt; Then you'll have to threaten him at gunpoint to get him into the same

<EM>&gt; We may consider some belief structures to be irrational, but that

<P>Here's some fun ideas for the scene of Osama bin Laden and an autoreplicator:
<BR>
<P>a) autoreplicate a Koran. An agent of satan could not possibly repeat the words
<BR>
of God or of the Prophet and still exist (this stunt was used to get phones into
<BR>
Saudi Arabia, where Abdul Aziz bin Saud heard the words of the Koran over the
<BR>
phone and declared that a tool of the devil could not speak the words of god.)
<BR>
<P>b) if you want to get Osama out of the way, force him into the replicator, so
<BR>
that you wind up with two Osama bin Ladens. Each will be conviced the other is a
<BR>
demonspawn of Satan, and will try to kill him off.... give each a gun and they
<BR>
will shoot each other...
<BR>
<P>c) use an autoreplicator to replicate an exact copy of Mecca, only put it in
<BR>
Washington DC, so that Osama will have to pray to both places.....
