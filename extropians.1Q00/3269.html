<P>
How does one go about entering a simulation, minus the knowledge that
<BR>
it's a simulation, without violating the constraints of informed
<BR>
consent?  Setting up your exoself to reprogram yourself &quot;ab initio&quot; and
<BR>
then lock you in an unbreakable hell would obviously appear to violate
<BR>
the informed consent standard, just as copying yourself and then
<BR>
torturing the copy would.
<BR>
<P>Since I'm one of the people who may wind up actually deciding the seed
<BR>
AI's default motivations (in the event there isn't a forced solution),
<BR>
I've given some thought to the issue.  I have two possible solutions:
<BR>
<P>1)  Subjunctive informed consent.  You can reprogram yourself to be
<BR>
Buffy, forget your external self, and send yourself through the second
<BR>
season of _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_ (this was NOT a happy season).  The
<BR>
invariant that establishes informed consent is that *if*, at any time,
<BR>
you knew the truth, you would still choose to go back in.  The question
<BR>
is what &quot;knowing the truth&quot; and &quot;you&quot; consist of, and how you and Buffy blend.
<BR>
<P>2)  Overlay informed consent.  We may find it very difficult to conceive
<BR>
of simultaneously &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;not knowing&quot; something, but I can
<BR>
imagine a cognitive architecture which would &quot;protect&quot; the core Buffy
<BR>
processes while maintaining the awareness and processing of the external
<BR>
self.  Any given sequence of cognitive events, including emotional
<BR>
bindings dependent on the belief that Sunnydale is real, would proceed
<BR>
as if the knowledge that the world is a simulation did not exist, and
<BR>
memories of that experience would be formed; however, a smooth blend
<BR>
between that untouched core and the external awareness would be
<BR>
maintained.  Thus you could remain &quot;you&quot; while being someone else.
<BR>
<P>The task is not programming either of those solutions into the AI, of
<BR>
course.  Nobody can foresee all the problems, so specifying solutions is
<BR>
inadequate as a method.  The task is creating a mind such that the SI,
<BR>
faced with the problem of informed consent, comes up with that sort of
<BR>
creative and satisfying solution, or at least a reasonable solution as
<BR>
opposed to a stupid or crystalline one.  Since the human intuitions are
<BR>
knowable and even explicable, this should be possible.  Of course, I'm
<BR>
hoping that all the moral questions have objective answers, which
<BR>
introduces the additional task constraint of not doing anything that
<BR>
would screw up the SI (or initial stages thereof) if the human
<BR>
intuitions turn out to be wrong.
