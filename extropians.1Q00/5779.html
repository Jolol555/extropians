<P>Great quote Ken, I didn't realize Shakespere was so enlightnened!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 	I think this is blatantly and obviously BS.
</EM><BR>
<P>I hate to say this Brent, but Ken is correct.  There is a saying
<BR>
in eastern philosophy -- &quot;Do not change your beliefs, transform
<BR>
the believer&quot;.  Until you become the system which &quot;has&quot; the perceptions
<BR>
and beliefs, rathern than the one that &quot;is&quot; the perceptions and beliefs,
<BR>
you are always ruled by it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; My Grandmother is dead!  I miss her horribly and feel huge amounts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pain because of this.
</EM><BR>
<P>So too are both of mine.  One was kept alive for many years, a virtual
<BR>
shell of herself who should have been allowed to die.  The other promised
<BR>
me (and she was a woman who would keep her promises), that if there were
<BR>
a way to come back and let me know the &quot;other side&quot; existed, she would
<BR>
do so.  To date, she hasn't.  I am glad that both of them lived and
<BR>
contributed to me what they could.  Sometimes I miss them.  But
<BR>
I am rarely sad for them (other than with regard to the pain one
<BR>
had to experience in dying of cancer).  They lived their lives and
<BR>
played their hands.  I would not, and I really doubt they would not, have
<BR>
had it any other way.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; She deserves this world she gave to me much more than I do.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why would you say such a thing?  I understand that you care, but
<BR>
given the gradual evolution of society, and the increase of knowledge,
<BR>
what you can create, etc.  I would rank people alive today as being
<BR>
more valuable than people alive in yester-year.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fact that she is now dead is BAD!
</EM><BR>
<P>There is no inherent BADness to death, you perceive the loss as bad
<BR>
because you miss her.  Unfortunately because this exists in the realm
<BR>
of your experience, probably nothing I could say will change your mind.
<BR>
There are exercises that I might be able to do with you to get you
<BR>
to see this, but it is fundamentally a Zen &quot;aha&quot; experience, that
<BR>
people must arrive at on their own.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No thinking any being could possibly do, whether emotional or purely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; abstract rational thinking like a computer could do, make this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anything other than BAD, and the fact that we are still alive Good.
</EM><BR>
<P>The fact that we are alive is *not* good.  It is just what is so.
<BR>
We perceive it as good, since we think being dead would feel bad.
<BR>
In fact, being dead, we cannot feel anything, so feeling good about
<BR>
being alive would seem to be accepting an illusion.  Accepting
<BR>
illusions as real, leads to the dark side.
<BR>
<P>I deeply empathise with those list members who have lost or may
<BR>
lose someone they care very much about.  I hope that you remember
<BR>
and perhaps tell stories about them and honor their memory.  We
<BR>
*will* lose some of the people on this list.  The best we can do
<BR>
is cherish them, honor them and share their wisdom and insights
<BR>
with others.  In that way they are never really gone.
<BR>
