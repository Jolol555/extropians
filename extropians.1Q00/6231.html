<P>
'What is your name?'  'Zero Powers.'  'Do you deny having written the
<BR>
following?':
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Look, my whole argument is that you can't guarantee yourself access to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;server, even if you can assure yourself access to the cameras. Remember,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;these servers are government owned and government run.  The government can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;take away the servers, and THEN where would you be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now you are assuming that the servers would be government owned and run.  I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never suggested this.  I don't even know that the sytem would need to depend 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on any central &quot;servers.&quot;  Even if some sort of central server were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; required, it would seem to make much more sense to me if the servers were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distributed, robust and redundant without any one hierarchical controlling 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; body.  Think Usenet.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am.  Part of the trouble here is that Usenet distributes information,
<BR>
without much processing after people type it in.  This is comparatively
<BR>
easy and cheap.  In addition, Usenet is a system where the more people who
<BR>
are using it, the more useful it becomes.
<BR>
<P>The servers you're describing are quite the reverse.  Relevance servers
<BR>
run best when it's only serving up the information relevant to me,
<BR>
(because it's searching the same data only once, for only one list of
<BR>
&quot;relevant&quot; things) works about half as well when it's serving up
<BR>
information relevant to both of us, etc.  With Usenet, I get some benefit
<BR>
from sharing it with you.  With the Relevance servers, I get much more
<BR>
benefit from keeping it away from you.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And even if it was necessary to have some sort of central oversight 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; committee (which I doubt) there is no reason why it would have to consist 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; solely of government employees.
</EM><BR>
<P>You're right.  Some private citizens could own a few Relevance servers as
<BR>
well.  But since they'd be a scarce resource and more useful the fewer get
<BR>
to use it, you can bet that they'd be expensive.  So, once again, only the
<BR>
powerful (this time the rich) get access to the Relevance servers.  But
<BR>
that still means that the gov't could shut them down if they wanted to;
<BR>
or, barring that, simply that the poor get monitored with no access to
<BR>
Relevance whereas the rich and gov't officials get monitored with lots of
<BR>
access to Relevance.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And, further, assuming that (1) it is necessary to have a centralized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; server
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't need it to be singular; I just need there to be a small number of
<BR>
centers, which is likely, because, unlike the Internet, this resource is
<BR>
less useful as it is shared.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; system and (2) it is necessary to have a single hierarchical controlling 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; body
</EM><BR>
<P>That needn't be the case.  So long as there are only a few centers, the
<BR>
gov't could seize control of them if it wanted to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; again as long as the body and its personnel and its decisions and its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actions were sufficiently transparent, it would not matter.
</EM><BR>
<P>You keep insisting on that.  But even if you doubt my claim that a
<BR>
despotism could arise, you must admit that if it DID arise, transparency
<BR>
wouldn't matter.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Have you ever *heard* of the US?  Have you ever been there?  I don't know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what you have read about democracy, but you obviously have never seen ours 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in action.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, I have.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;The most vivid example we have of a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;despot rising to power where there was once a democracy was Hitler.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you wanted to be a despot in America, you'd do it the way he did it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well much as that might make for an interesting thought experiment, I'm not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to pursue it further.  I don't see any despot rising to power in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US or in *any* similarly constitutional democracy.  Keep singing that same 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; song if you want, fact of the matter is it ain't gonna happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Look at it this way.  If you're right about our country, then it's not a
<BR>
fact about transparency that makes you right.  It's a fact about the way
<BR>
the citizens of the United States are.  In a different place, or at some
<BR>
other time, you'd be wrong about what the people were like, and under
<BR>
those circumstances, a despotism *could* happen.  So I could even concede
<BR>
to you that, right now, a despotism in America is unthinkable, even with
<BR>
ubiquitous surveilance.
<BR>
<P>However, American culture need not always be like that.  It could one day
<BR>
be more like China, or Soviet Russia, or France, or India, or Germany or
<BR>
Tibet, or who knows what.  So insisting that despotism will NEVER happen
<BR>
in this country seems much too strong a principle for anyone to support.
<BR>
(I actually DO think that America is prone to despotism today, but I think
<BR>
that's too strong a cultural claim to support here; besides, I don't need
<BR>
that argument to justify my point, so it's not relevant.)
<BR>
<P>Finally, I've argued time and time again that the powerful get more use
<BR>
out of this system than the weak.  I'll now weaken my claim to the
<BR>
following: in the sort of state where despotism is possible, a system
<BR>
which empowers the powerful and weakens the weak makes despotism easier
<BR>
and more likely.
<BR>
<P>But if you bought my line of argument above, despotism is *possible*
<BR>
everywhere, though it may be fifty or even 100 years down the road.  So
<BR>
the fact that this system would make despotism easier when (not if) the
<BR>
time is ripe for it implies to me that this system should, to whatever
<BR>
extent possible, be avoided.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Not if the despot manages to get a mandate from the people first.  Hitler,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;you'll recall, had the popular vote.  How would a transparent society have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;prevented Hitler from rising to power?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A constitutional democracy like that in the US (transparent or not) would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have prevented Hitler from rising to power.  Because it is simply 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unconstitutional to become a despot in the US.  The only way to do it is to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1) *drastically* amend, or throw out the constitution or (2) militarily 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take over.  One *last* time, that is *NOT* going to happen.
</EM><BR>
<P>Even if I agreed with you here: do you think the Constitution will last
<BR>
forever?  What happens when the US federal gov't as such is replaced?
<BR>
What will become of this country?
<BR>
<P>Take the long view on this one.
