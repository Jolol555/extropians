<P>Policing the Internet: Anyone but Government
<BR>
<P>By STEVE LOHR
<BR>
<P>The attacks on eBay, Yahoo, E*Trade and other big Web sites earlier this
<BR>
month showed the Internet to be surprisingly vulnerable to a few
<BR>
laptop-toting cyber-vandals. This is a pressing public concern, surely, as
<BR>
the nation increasingly comes to rely for commerce and everyday
<BR>
communication on this chaotic, global computer network.
<BR>
<P>But when President Clinton met last week with more than two dozen
<BR>
representatives of the Internet community, a big role for government was
<BR>
not on the agenda. The president asked what could or should the Government
<BR>
do. Not a lot, the Internet elite told him. The message: It's an industry
<BR>
issue.
<BR>
<P>&quot;No one in that room was asking the government to fix this problem,&quot; said
<BR>
Nicholas Donofrio, senior vice president for technology at I.B.M., who
<BR>
attended the meeting.
<BR>
<P>The gathering epitomized the main thrust of Government policy in the
<BR>
Internet arena. Government, the theory goes, should offer a forum and be a
<BR>
cooperative partner, so as to facilitate the rapid rise of Internet
<BR>
commerce. That stance was set in a July 1997 policy document on E-commerce
<BR>
written by Ira Magaziner, a senior White House policy adviser at the time.
<BR>
His document extolled the &quot;breakneck speed of change in the technology&quot; and
<BR>
stated, &quot;Government attempts to regulate [the Internet] are likely to be
<BR>
outmoded by the time they are finally enacted.&quot;
<BR>
<P>The hands-off approach, however, will be challenged more and more as the
<BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;

<BR>
<P>What should we do to avoid repeats of  the recent denial-of-service (DOS)
<BR>
attacks on Websites such as Yahoo! and eBay?
<BR>
<P>As I've said, the Net gives economies of scale to individuals - even to
<BR>
criminals.  And a further creepy aspect of these attacks is that they came
<BR>
from the machines of unsuspecting third parties whose machines had earlier
<BR>
been compromised by the attackers. That is, some people's poor security was
<BR>
used to attack third parties - whose security was not compromised but whose
<BR>
machines couldn't function because of the volume of traffic sent their way.
<BR>
Thus, we can't just say that the victims deserved it because of their own
<BR>
loose security.
<BR>
<P>Most of the solutions suggested for such security problems (and future ones)
<BR>
involve strong government regulation and surveillance. And many of the
<BR>
reactions to the solutions justifiably point out the dangers to individual
<BR>
freedom if we create a Police Net - the virtual equivalent of a police state.
<BR>
<P>But we don't necessarily need to make a one-dimensional choice between
<BR>
security and freedom.  A more fruitful approach is to look at public  as a
<BR>
kind of public health/safety problem, and ask how we can improve public
<BR>
hygiene/safety.  For starters, people - at companies, universities, and any
<BR>
other organization that uses computers - need to be encouraged to secure
<BR>
their machines, both for their own safety and so they cannot be compromised
<BR>
to launch an attack on someone else.
<BR>
<P>How to make this happen? Regulations would probably set a minimum and a
<BR>
clear target that criminals would take delight in working around.  And
<BR>
government surveillance, limitations on anonymity, required registration of
<BR>
all users…..the cure might be worse than the disease.
<BR>
<P>Instead, there are a number of paths to pursue; there's no single solution.
<BR>
To start, consider what the insurance industry and liability laws did for
<BR>
fire safety. The insurance companies should get involved, since every large
<BR>
company has been calling its insurance company this month (or looking for
<BR>
one). And they *will* get involved, since it's a nice line of business.  Of
<BR>
course, the point is for them to take the trouble to *reduce* the risks
<BR>
rather than simply charging high premiums for high risks. Insurance
<BR>
companies need to get the expertise to assess their clients' security
<BR>
systems. And they will probably also turn to all those consultants and
<BR>
experts who no longer have Y2K to worry about/bill for. Security consulting
<BR>
is a nice new line of business - and it's socially responsible!
<BR>
<P>And a final step, one which could benefit from government/regulatory action:
<BR>
Require that companies disclose their security practices and potential
<BR>
liabilities in financial statements. ISPs and computer vendors would have to
<BR>
disclose the security provisions of the systems and services they sell, and
<BR>
could also be sued for negligence.
<BR>
<P>Then we could let the market (and yes, the lawyers!) take care of it, far
<BR>
more flexibly than formal regulations and requirements could. Yes, it's a
<BR>
pity to bring in lawyers and liability, but that is an easier cost to bear
<BR>
than the loss of freedom.
<BR>
<P>In short, we  need to understand that electronic security costs money, just
<BR>
like regular security (locks, guards, alarm systems).  Power implies
<BR>
responsibility; if you buy a computer that can be used as a weapon, you need
<BR>
to make sure that it is designed and installed safely. Of course your
<BR>
average user doesn't know how to set up a safe system, but he needs to
<BR>
demand service from someone who does.  Smaller businesses (who don't file
<BR>
financial statements with the public) need to understand that they are
<BR>
liable, just like the guy who doesn't bother to shovel his sidewalk after
<BR>
the snowstorm.
<BR>
<P>Yes, it's a pity to rely on the legal system, but better that than
<BR>
government surveillance. Government-sponsored *education* (and due-care
<BR>
precedents set in court) could be very valuable, but self-interested
<BR>
companies will also provide education in the form of advertising outlining
<BR>
the dangers and their solutions. May the best solutions evolve to match the
<BR>
evolving risks!
