<EM>&gt;Robert, thank you for putting so well into words the value of religion in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;human lives.  You can say things so much better then I can.  Religion can 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be a healthy and powerful structure to achieve mental discipline and try to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reach out to something greater then oneself.
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<P>I am a former fundamentalist Christian, turned humanistic-rationalistic 
<BR>
agnostic.  What does that mean?  It means I’ve come to realize that there is 
<BR>
no possible way of rationally satisfying myself that “God” exists and so, 
<BR>
for me, his existence is irrelevant.  My efforts now center on trying to 
<BR>
figure out a rational basis for my moral judgment and ethical behavior (no 
<BR>
easy feat).  On the one hand I am thankful for my years of religious study 
<BR>
and training, as I believe it has imbedded in me some values that I find, 
<BR>
well, of value.  Stuff like loving your neighbor has become second nature 
<BR>
for me, and I’m glad about that.  However, when I think of all the time I 
<BR>
spent in church and studying what amount to ancient fairytales and behaving 
<BR>
in a way that I hoped would be pleasing to God, rather than doing more 
<BR>
constructive things with my time, I do feel robbed of a good deal of my 
<BR>
life.
<BR>
<P>When I think of the collective time and energy we spend behaving in ways 
<BR>
that are not rationally ideally suited to deal with modern human 
<BR>
circumstances simply because that behavior conforms to the not-necessarily 
<BR>
rational Judeo-Christian ethic, again I feel that we are being robbed.  For 
<BR>
instance, why all the fussing and fighting about gay marriage, teenage 
<BR>
contraception, abortion, euthanasia and legalizing marijuana (which 
<BR>
unquestionably has medicinal benefits and is less harmful than either 
<BR>
alcohol or tobacco)?
<BR>
<P>So, in some ways for me personally religion hath both given and taken away.  
<BR>
But, all things considered, I wish religion would just go away so that we 
<BR>
humans could do what we do best...use our cognitive skills to solve our 
<BR>
problems, rather than modifying our behavior to suit the whims of a 
<BR>
non-existent Old Man in the sky.
<BR>
