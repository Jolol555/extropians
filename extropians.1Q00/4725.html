<P><EM>&gt; The problem here is that most &quot;uploaders&quot; seem to consider only the pattern 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of neural impulses, their storage, tranmission, the particulars of the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neurons and how they process input to produce output.  In fact, this is only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one aspect of consciousness.  Transmisssion and storage of information also 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takes place on totally non-&quot;digital&quot; levels, as in the focusing and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activations of groups or systems of neurons via hormonal discharge or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; takeup, which may be experienced as emotion or various states of general 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attention or preparedness.  Or the physiological feedback from your own body 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as it serves to cue or clue.  You could then totally mimic the logic and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; miss attaining a real upload at all.  But, in reality, you aren't mimicking 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the logic, but only what that limited linear processing model takes into 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account.
</EM><BR>
<P>No serious upload proposals leave this out. Fortunately hormone
<BR>
interactions and similar chemical information processing seems to be
<BR>
computationally fairly simple to simulate (albeit of course incredibly
<BR>
messy). They might not be digital, but that doesn't make them hard to
<BR>
simulate (in fact, biological realistic neuron simulations treat the
<BR>
internal states of cells in an analog way and then calculate the
<BR>
resulting behavior from this - an action potential might look like any
<BR>
other action potential and appear quite digital, but in a compartment
<BR>
model simulation they are caused by analogue ion permeability
<BR>
changes). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; A friend who has spent most of his life trying to create real uploads 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recently put it that the real Turing test is satisfied only when and if the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual involved is convinced that he or she really is there in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; upload.
</EM><BR>
<P>Interesting friend you have, what kind of methods and models does
<BR>
he/she use? I agree that the definition of a successful upload in my
<BR>
opinion would be that the *upload* consider itself to be the
<BR>
original. What the original (if it still exists) thinks is irrelevant.
