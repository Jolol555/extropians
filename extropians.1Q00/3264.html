It is pretty hard to die in away that prevents your body from arriving at a 
<BR>
hospital within an hour or less - just don't get yourself killed while 
<BR>
you're off camping in the middle of nowhere.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Really? lol  A person could easily die in their home if they live alone and 
<BR>
be lying there decaying for several days before someone comes for them!  So 
<BR>
a dedicated cryonicist must be married with eight kids or have a bunch of 
<BR>
roommates or boarders!  Take your choice! :)

Most of the damage sources that cryonicists agonize over, like freezing 
<BR>
damage and ischemic injury, are very regular in nature and hence should be 
<BR>
very easy to reverse. So, your odds of getting an adequate suspension are 
<BR>
very high no matter how you end up dying.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>What do you mean by regular in nature?  The processes by which decay of 
<BR>
brain structure happens?  Again, I find myself thinking that I hope an 
<BR>
optimist in this area is right but I think more research is necessary.  Both 
<BR>
for cryonics and for an understanding of just how hardy or fragile the 
<BR>
nature of memory is.  I look forward to Eugene Leitl's report that will have 
<BR>
pics and various experts interpretting what is there.  Then, we can have 
<BR>
quite a discussion on this list!
