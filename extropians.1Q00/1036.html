<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; of a soul before they're willing to view life as just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  &gt; a collection of molecules. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Life _is_ &quot;just a collection of molecules&quot;, in exactly the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way that the Mona Lisa is just some smudges of colored oil on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; piece of cloth, or that the Declaration of Independence is just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some squiggles of black liquid on pounded plant fibers.  It is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the _information_ about how those molecules are arranged that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unique and valuable; and it is that information that we wish to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; preserve, not the mere physical substrates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;Unique and valuable&quot; to whom? It could be argued that the arrangement of
<BR>
those molecules that make up the Mona Lisa or the Declaration of Independence
<BR>
is no more unique and valuable than the information content of a rock, or
<BR>
more appropriately a person-made rock.  It is your &quot;interpretation&quot; that
<BR>
assigns value and the quality of uniqueness to the information contained in
<BR>
those structures. Who's to say that my interpretation of the Mona Lisa as a
<BR>
piece of junk (not my actual belief) is any &quot;better&quot; than yours?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The only information value of a zygote is its genome.  A human
</EM><BR>
<P>I might be splitting hairs here, but I think that statement is far too bold.
<BR>
There is plenty of &quot;informational value&quot; associated with the structures that
<BR>
comprise the zygote outside of just its genome.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being that was born and lived contains far more information: all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of eir life experiences and ideas and successes and failures.  A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; raw genome can't be anywhere near as valuable as that.  Our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intuition and legal system that sees zygote as something less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a full human being is a correct application of this fact.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>So, where do you draw the line and for what application of the rules within a
<BR>
system? Is the person that you were yesterday &quot;less of a human being&quot; than
<BR>
you are today? Where do children fit along the continuum, not to mention
<BR>
other species that are significantly related humans? What is the *objective*
<BR>
criteria that can be used to lay down the threshhold line that says: On this
<BR>
side you are not &quot;human&quot; and over on this side you are? I think this issue is
<BR>
a lot more complicated than your summary posting would indicate. Hence the
<BR>
controversy associated with abortion, animal rights, etc.
