<EM>&gt;That is interesting information.

<P>No, it just follows from the fact that they each have a copy of a book 
<BR>
dedicated to them that highlights some of Eliezer's early position 
<BR>
statements and cites his urls. As it happens, I've also asked Vernor 
<BR>
directly for his opinion of Eli's schemata, and he replied quite recently 
<BR>
(as I mentioned privately to Eliezer) that he hadn't yet looked at the 
<BR>
relevant pages. I can't recall whether Hans has commented specifically on 
<BR>
this, but I get the strong impression that he hasn't been in touch with 
<BR>
Eliezer, as one might expect if he were enthusiastic. (I do know that Hans 
<BR>
has read THE SPIKE, since he tells me it had some small impact on his final 
<BR>
revisions of ROBOT.) Dr Hanson, of course, can speak for himself.

<P><EM> &gt;Yes, I'm annoyed.

<P>You have no reason to be. I must stress that what I wrote was not--and was 
<BR>
not meant to be read as--any kind of denigration of Eli or his efforts, but 
<BR>
was a response to an off-hand comment by someone else. (Perhaps my jokey 
<BR>
subject head lent itself to misreading; it was meant lightheartedly, after 
<BR>
the manner of, you know, Buffy and the gang). I'm prepared to take 
<BR>
Eliezer's case far more seriously than, say, any of us (I assume) take the 
<BR>
Lorrey Drive, because its goal does not fly in the face of what we know to 
<BR>
be true and its advocate is one exceptionally smart puppy.
<BR>
<P>And as Eli suggests in his own comment (`estimates of what I can do will 
<BR>
have to  depend on your own ability to read _Coding_ et. al.'), and as I 
<BR>
freely declared in my original note, I'm certainly incompetent to gauge the 
<BR>
worth of any programmer's code or project design. Let's not jump the gun, 
<BR>
is all. (Oh no, I said the g*n word.)
