<EM>&gt; Hey guys, look at this...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [Corel Linux on cheap Intel boxes...]
</EM><BR>
<P>Do we really want the whole world using UNIX?  I'll answer
<BR>
that question for you - no!  But here's the trillion dollar
<BR>
question, what OS will we be running in the near future if
<BR>
not Windows?  Mac OS?  BeOS?  OS/2 Warp?  Anyone know of any
<BR>
promising non-UNIX open source projects?
<BR>
<P>It looks to me like Windows is almost ready to die and we
<BR>
don't have anything to take its place in the hearts and
<BR>
minds of Joe Average (as far as Joe's concerned has there
<BR>
been any innovation beyond the original Mac?  Does Mac OS X
<BR>
have enough eye candy to fool Joe in to thinking computing
<BR>
has advanced, or will Joe have to continue to rely on id
<BR>
Software for that?).  Every company that could be developing
<BR>
such an OS (I use OS here in the loose Microsoft sense, I'm
<BR>
a fan of bloat) is either on the Linux bandwagon or on the
<BR>
'Internet Appliances' bandwagon; neither are going anywhere
<BR>
(I hope).  I don't think the right OS will emerge from the
<BR>
Internet, not in a timely fashion, but I do believe its
<BR>
source should be open.
<BR>
<P>I recently read an article in which a journalist claimed
<BR>
that because of the Web, it doesn't matter what OS you're
<BR>
using as long as it can run a browser.  I've seen other
<BR>
journalists claim similar things.  When people genuinely
<BR>
believe bastardised hypertext is the pinnacle of human
<BR>
achievement it's time to innovate, and fast!
<BR>
<P>Sometimes I wonder if the current dot-com madness, which
<BR>
places the emphasis not on technology but on some vague idea
<BR>
of a future business model, is simply due to a lull in
<BR>
software development due to our underestimating the
<BR>
complexity of voice interfaces and other exotica.  Is there
<BR>
room for something new or should we wait until there's
<BR>
enough hardware to do more exotic forms of human-computer
<BR>
interaction, or perhaps even remove the human altogether?
<BR>
<P>BM
