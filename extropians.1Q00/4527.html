<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think this list is the place to recount the many reasons
<BR>
Unix sucks much less than Windows.  Not a very forward looking
<BR>
discussion, and one that can be found repeated zillions of
<BR>
times on the net.  See &lt;<A HREF="http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/">http://www.unix-vs-nt.org/</A>&gt; for one
<BR>
perspective.  And yes, the fact that there are non-proprietary
<BR>
implementations of Unix is a major reason why its widespread
<BR>
use would be preferred by me to Windows even disregarding
<BR>
all technical issues.
<BR>
<P>Now, invoking Godwin's law, Bill Gates is powerful, Hitler
<BR>
was powerful, you appear to be defending Windows, therefore
<BR>
you're a Nazi sympathizer.  The end.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Both, they're interrelated.  To do anything useful with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; UI requires changes to the architecture.  And vice versa.
</EM><BR>
<P>They aren't interrelated at all (well, perhaps they are in
<BR>
the case of Windows, and that's a major problem).  Unix doesn't
<BR>
require what is usually thought of as a UI at all.  All I
<BR>
need is port 23 (telnet) or some more secure alternative and
<BR>
I can do 100% of what I need to do day to day on a Unix box,
<BR>
including running any graphical applications remotely.
<BR>
<P>X has &quot;won&quot; the Unix display for the most part, but it has
<BR>
been clearly demonstrated that X can be replaced with no
<BR>
changes to the Unix architecture.  See Display Postscript
<BR>
systems (e.g., NextStep and NeWS) for example.
<BR>
<P>X itself is a very low level set of primitives, and wildly
<BR>
divergement UIs may be built on top of it, again with no
<BR>
architecture changes.  See the zillions of X toolkits,
<BR>
window managers, and desktop projects for undeniable 
<BR>
evidence.
