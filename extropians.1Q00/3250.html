<EM>&gt;Pain and death should lower GWP.  I agree that in principle GWP could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be improved to measure individual preferences for &quot;freedom&quot;, but I'm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;skeptical that this choice is close enough to the border line that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;adding freedom in would actually change the decision.  How much larger
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than the pain and death effects do you think the freedom effect would be?
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;It isn't obvious that there is any correlation between pain and GWP.
<BR>
The correlation between GWP and the value most people place on avoiding
<BR>
death is probably much closer to zero than to one. I assume it's possible
<BR>
to estimate this by comparing the present value of a person's income to
<BR>
the value of life implied by how much that person will pay for safety. I
<BR>
suspect such comparisons will indicate that GWP underestimates the value
<BR>
of life by one or two orders of magnitude.
<BR>
&nbsp;I suspect the freedom effect is roughly the same magnitude as the other
<BR>
effects.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;You spoke of giving a single agency responsibility for measuring the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;objective function. Such agencies always have some ability to add their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;own biases into the decisions involved in producing such indicators. ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I could go for having several competing agencies measure things with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;official measurement being some combination (e.g., median) of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;That would certainly improve the incentives and remove the random biases,
<BR>
and would substantially reduce my objections.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;The later doesn't preclude the former.  The public is only willing to attend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to a small fraction of decisions.  So the key is how to let the public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;control all the decisions they don't attend to.  I imagine the public using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decisions like whether to bomb Serbia to tweak existing weights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;That is, you might see that using the current weights the decision is to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bomb Serbia.  Since you don't like this decision, you might &quot;trace&quot; this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;decision by examining the different components, such as GWP up .001% and 100
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deaths of innocents.  You might see that increasing the weight on innocent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deaths by 20% could tip the decision the other way, and so you might lobby
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for such a change.  The people who would oppose you are those who see this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;change reversing other decisions that they like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Given some rough equilibrium of political pressure, the weights would settle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;down somewhere.  And the big benefit is that all the other decisions, the
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;They would settle somewhere, but I'm unconvinced that it would have much
<BR>
connection with the average person's values.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I'd rather use something like a science court approach - have economists
<BR>
compete to see whether they can produce an indicator that reliably predict
<BR>
what a randonly chosen group of people would decide if paid to study the
<BR>
question carefully.
<BR>
&nbsp;For areas where such predictions have been proven reliable, I expect voter
<BR>
pressure would be sufficient to produce the right result without a
<BR>
constitutional rule. For the forseeable future, I expect there will remain
<BR>
subject areas for which the indicators have not been shown to make reliable
<BR>
predictions.
