Hey, I'm having some troubles joining this list...Hi, I'm on my friend's 
<BR>
account right now, writing this...I've been trying to join this 
<BR>
extropians-list for some considerable time, but I either can't find the 
<BR>
correct name for this particular list or I'm just not being sent the 
<BR>
messages. Inso far I have joined three different lists, but either found 
<BR>
that they did not send me e-mail or found that it was the wrong one...for 
<BR>
some time I received messages but very few of my postings were actually 
<BR>
listed....but anyway. If someone could send me the details on this, I would 
<BR>
be *extremely* grateful.- -Neal

<P>This is a very difficult list to join.  We purposely have multiple &quot;front&quot; 
<BR>
lists to throw people off!  It is purposely a labyrinth of confusion to 
<BR>
discourage those who are not truly dedicated and pure in heart.  And of 
<BR>
course not all your posts have gotten through, we have a committee that 
<BR>
reviews ALL posts to check them for intrinsic extropian value!  It would be 
<BR>
wrong to send you the details on how to subscribe to the list, you must 
<BR>
endure and overcome to be worthy!
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg :)
