FLIR recreation, people are visible next to all the fired weapons, whereas

people unless other people are firing them, and such people being visible

in EVERY instance of the &quot;recreational&quot; gunfire, but in NO instance of the

the Branch Davidians' attorney that such glints represent gunfire.  
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IAN: Where does it say shooters were &quot;visible in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;EVERY instance&quot;? But actually, they should be for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the reason Mike Lorrey stated. I was sure to check 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the high temperature yesterday in Waco for just that 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reason, and it was 69 degrees. However, it was in the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mid 80s on April 19, 1993. There's a very big difference
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here. A person laying in a sun-drenched field most likely 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wearing heavy camouflage gear with air temps in the 80s is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably not going to be much warmer than the ground, and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;their clothing will probably be the same temperature as 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ground. To a FLIR camera, this temperature identity
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;means that the person on the ground will be invisible. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as McNulty's latest video shows, two gunmen 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAN be seen with muzzle flashes occurring exactly in 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;front of them, and these gunmen just exited a tank,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unlike the gunmen inherently in the other positions. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These gunmen can be seen as black, human-shaped objects 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;since their clothing is cooler than the ground because
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they just exited the air-conditioned tank. The fact
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is if you see these flashes of light, they're quite
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obviously gun shots, they flash a rates equal to a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;machine gun and you can see their pear shape, ie, they 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are wide at the muzzle end and taper in the direction 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the gun is being fired. As the fire starts, you can also 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;see embers flashing as they blow in the wind. There is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an unmistakable difference between the gun flashes 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the flashes of embers blowing away from the fire.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never see any glints of light in the large fields 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of building debris, nor do you ever see reflections of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sun in the pool of water from the many angles of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;view as the plane circles above, but you do see the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reflection of the sun in the same pool with a visible- 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radiation video taken overhead. I have the whole FLIR 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;tape (not just the segments shown in McNulty's videos) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and have watched them extensively. I'll bet that there 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is a reason they wanted these tests secret. Amazing 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;how CNN is spinning this toward the favor of the FBI 
<BR>
