<P>Robert I could have done a better job explaining myself.  I was at
<BR>
a nanoschmooze last evening.  The K. Eric and crew were having
<BR>
an office warming for the new Foresight Institute in Los Altos.  I
<BR>
didnt say much, I merely stood by and listened to some of the
<BR>
conversations that went on there, and it was most enlightening.
<BR>
I imagined bringing my brother to one of these gatherings, without
<BR>
forewarning him what might be discussed there.  I can assure you,
<BR>
he would not grok it.  And hes normal.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>Consider an attitude that many of us have, so self evident
<BR>
that it scarcely needs stating, summarized as follows:
<BR>
<P>If humanity manages to defeat tyranny and superstition, unlimited
<BR>
technological achievement is as inevitable as the sunrise.
<BR>
<P>Blindingly obvious, right?  NO!  This notion is not even the majority
<BR>
opinion of... the rest of humanity.  Robert, why is this?  What am I
<BR>
missing?  Or what are they missing?  spike

<P>Hey I wrote this, I think Ill use it as my tagline:

*************************************************

If humanity manages to defeat tyranny and superstition, unlimited

technological achievement is as inevitable as the sunrise.
