Background:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/03/14/florida.vouchers/">http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/03/14/florida.vouchers/</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/03/14/florida.school.voucher.ap/">http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/03/14/florida.school.voucher.ap/</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/1999/US/12/20/school.vouchers.02/">http://www.cnn.com/1999/US/12/20/school.vouchers.02/</A>
<BR>
<P>So, in both Florida and Ohio the voucher programs are down.
<BR>
But the reasons are quite different.  In Cleveland they are saying
<BR>
its a violation of the separation between Church and State, while
<BR>
in Florida they are saying that it violates the state's constitutional
<BR>
requirement to provide a &quot;high-quality system of free public schools&quot;.
<BR>
<P>However, the voucher supporters seem to be vowing to pursue this.
<BR>
The articles seem to suggest that given the variability of the
<BR>
state constitutions, unless the Supreme Court says &quot;no vouchers&quot;, we
<BR>
are likely to get some split between voucher and non-voucher states.
<BR>
<P>Given the recent newspaper article, where I think it was claimed
<BR>
<EM>&gt;60% (!) of Americans supported teaching both the theories of
</EM><BR>
creationism and evolution side-by-side, of course it doesn't take
<BR>
much to realize that if parents move their children en-mass to
<BR>
&quot;religious&quot; education, we are going to end up with a larger fraction
<BR>
of the population who cannot think &quot;rationally&quot;.  [Unless you
<BR>
believe in the pipe-dream that a &quot;religious&quot; education will
<BR>
promote rational thought and downplay &quot;miracles&quot;.]
<BR>
<P>Now, fairly often the finger-of-blame for the poor-quality public
<BR>
education goes to the teacher's unions.  How do extropians reconcile
<BR>
the freedom people should have to organize for collective barginning
<BR>
with the result (which seems to be the freedom to teach poorly)?
<BR>
