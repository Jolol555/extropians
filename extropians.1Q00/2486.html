<P><EM>&gt;Let's make a fruit salad from the trees of knowledge and life! I guess
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it would be delicious with a little bit of whipped cream.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm sure, if you like fruit salad.  Just the other day I was walking by
<BR>
the Tree of Life.  I leaped past the rotating flaming sword (you know,
<BR>
it's just like in Dragon's Lair---you just wait until the right moment,
<BR>
listen carefully for the grunts, then tap the joystick just right. . . .)
<BR>
and got some of the fruit.  The apples make a particularly nice chutney.
<BR>
But God showed up and was a little bothered.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;God: Hey!  What do you think you're doing?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me: Uh, freely partaking of the Tree of Life.  Why?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;God: How did you get past the flaming sword?  They told me that thing was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;guaranteed!  I mean, there are flames on it!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me: It says how to somewhere in an old issue of [Electronic Games], I
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;think.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;God: Well, I don't care.  The patent laws in the Garden are pretty
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;strict.  Do you think that this is the Free Fruit Foundation or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something?  My one-pick shopping method means that you can only take
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one piece of fruit.  Then you're out.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me: What about a pointed stick?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;God: Shut up!
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me: Look, I've got better things to do than argue with imaginary beings
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;about magic fruit.  When I get nanotech I'll be able to make all the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fruit I want from snow and paper towels.  But I won't even bother
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because I'll be busy doing things like carking myself into the black
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hole at the center of the galaxy and figuring out how to get myself
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off of Banana Republic's catalog mailing list.  So get rid of that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;silly sword and those pretentious white robes and do something
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;useful.  Zyvex could use a synthetic organic chemist.  Think you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might be interested?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;God: Uh, y--yeah, actually.  I--I'll apply right away.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me: Good.  You'll need new bibles; they can found through links at
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;www.foresight.org.
