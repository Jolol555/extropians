<P><EM>&gt; AGNOSTIC AND ATHEIST:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I just see no positive reason to believe this, many strong reasons to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt it, and so lack belief.
</EM><BR>
<P>Is it therefore not possible for an atheist to make life easier to himself by 
<BR>
simply reformulating the statement &quot;I doubt the belief in God&quot; into a more 
<BR>
positive statement like &quot;man is on his own without any God to help him, to 
<BR>
trust in, or to blame&quot; ?  
<BR>
<P>The second, more positive, formulation above makes it easier, for example, to 
<BR>
make positive predictions like &quot;Jesus will NOT resurrect, and will NOT visit 
<BR>
Jerusalem, in the year 2001&quot;.  The first, doubtful, formulation above of 
<BR>
atheism doesn't allow direct predictions like this -- but any atheist would (I 
<BR>
think) be very willing to bet a large sum of money on this prediction !  I 
<BR>
think that any atheist who SAYS he only supports the first, more doubtful, 
<BR>
statement, in practice very probably uses the second, more outspoken, 
<BR>
statement anyway. 
<BR>
<P>Lack of evidence either way makes it (I think) *possible* to reformulate one's 
<BR>
&quot;beliefs&quot; into positive statements in this way without any change in one's 
<BR>
claims about the 'truth' of these theories.  So, when doing so might turn one 
<BR>
into a more effective entity, why not exploit this and -- purely as an act of 
<BR>
'memetic engineering' of the theories one uses as one's 'operating system' -- 
<BR>
reformulate atheism/agnosticism (when these stop more or less after saying &quot;I 
<BR>
don't know and I can't make any predictions&quot;) into a more outspoken statement 
<BR>
that 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Presents the same thing as a *positive* item of &quot;knowledge&quot; and which 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;therefore (I think) is easier to use as a basis for one's actions, 
<BR>
<P>and/or that
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- Drags into the open the assumptions one uses in practice anyway ?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Onward!
</EM><BR>
<P>Excelsior !
