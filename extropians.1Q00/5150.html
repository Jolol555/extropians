<EM>&gt; &gt; I find it interesting that this great social initiative is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; coming not from the democratically elected government of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; wealthy nation, but from a private individual...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  If I understand the slant of your remark  it would be appropriate to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; respond by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; asking where the Library of Congress, as well all most of the libraries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; around the country come from?
</EM><BR>
<P>If my memory's correct, the Library of Congress is in the Constitution -- I
<BR>
don't have my copy handy right now  (I know I could look it up on the web,
<BR>
BUT I've got to get to work in a few minutes) -- or by an act of Congress
<BR>
very early on.
<BR>
<P>As for the rest of the nation's libraries, aside from the private ones, many
<BR>
were started by Andrew Carnegie earlier this century.  He provided the seed
<BR>
money for them.
<BR>
<P>I don't know what you guys are getting at as I did not keep copies of this
<BR>
thread.  Anyway, libraries on the whole tend to be useless these days --
<BR>
unless you get a good one with up to date references material and technical
<BR>
works.  (The difference between having the latest issues of the journal you
<BR>
need versus some popular publication like _Scientific American_ or, worse,
<BR>
_Discover_.)  My local one -- and perhaps the local one in every place I've
<BR>
lived -- had inadequate collections for most of the research I do.  I've had
<BR>
to purchase or borrow materials from other sources over the years.  If I did
<BR>
not do this, my understanding of certain topics -- mathematics, biology,
<BR>
computer science -- would be decades behind actual research.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
