<EM>&gt; Sure, a lot of folks could gripe about &quot;somebody done done me wrong.&quot;  And
</EM><BR>
I
<BR>
<EM>&gt; suppose many people would argue that they are just as entitled to some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handouts as Indians and blacks.  I'm sure there are a million and one
</EM><BR>
points
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to be made on each side of the issue and admittedly I haven't thought them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all through.
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem is not that &quot;a lot of folks could gripe&quot; or that &quot;many people
<BR>
would argue that they are just as entitled to some handouts&quot; based on some
<BR>
unfair treatment of their ancestors.  I bet almost every last person on the
<BR>
planet can!  I could argue that my ancestors in Europe were poorly treated,
<BR>
which is why they left for America.  Am I now owed something by those
<BR>
descendants of the then rulers?  (Likewise, I'm sure if I look hard enough,
<BR>
I could find ancestors of mine who did some ill to someone whose descendants
<BR>
are still around.  Do I now owe them for it?  Do the sins of the parents get
<BR>
visited on the offspring?  (The gender neutral way of putting this lacks
<BR>
flair!:))
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But to me it would just feel right giving poor Indian and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; black kids an educational leg up.  But, then again, I suppose that with
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; new tuition free Cyber-University we'll soon have...tuition?!?  We don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; need no stinkin' tuition!
</EM><BR>
<P>If it feels right for you, then no one is going to stop you from donating
<BR>
money to a college fund or something else.  You might persuade others to do
<BR>
so.  Heck, I'd like to see more Native Americans and Blacks moving into
<BR>
science and technology research -- rather than welfare rolls or jail.  But I
<BR>
am vehemently against forcing people to pay for this, especially on the
<BR>
shakey grounds that their ancestors were done wrong and, therefore, everyone
<BR>
else owes them a living.
<BR>
<P>The one difference, however, with Native Americans, is that their nations
<BR>
are still recognized.  The right thing to do in their case, would be to give
<BR>
as much land as is possible back to them and allow them to find their way in
<BR>
the world.  We can't undo the last 500 years, but we can give all that
<BR>
Federal land in the US back to them -- where it can be proven that it is
<BR>
their land.  Then recreation (skiing, boating, etc.), mining, and logging
<BR>
concerns would have to pay a more equitable price for its usage and be less
<BR>
likely to damage it in the process.
