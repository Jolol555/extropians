but truth be told, global corporations play both sides of the game. Nor do I 
<BR>
think of CEOs as &quot;the new conquering Caesars[sic]...&quot; There are some 
<BR>
unscrupulous business people out there, but a Caesars is not so petty and 
<BR>
small.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Caesars(spelled it right this time! lol) were not at times petty and 
<BR>
small-minded?  I find that impossible to believe!  Or were they 'grand' in 
<BR>
the magnificance of the terror they inflicted on groups while our 
<BR>
present-day international execs just do not operate with such flair?
<BR>
<P>I think I understand you to be saying that a usual international exec has a 
<BR>
much more narrow focus of power and interest, so even when doing harm, it is 
<BR>
in the name of particular business interests.  He or she may not even have a 
<BR>
'big-picture' understanding of the trouble they are causing.
<BR>
<P>Daniel continues:
<BR>
The problem here is that John is taking the metaphor too far. Granted, there 
<BR>
are parallels between US behavior and that of many other empires, but it's 
<BR>
not just another production of the great &quot;Tragedy of Empire.&quot; China, e.g., 
<BR>
is an empire in its own right. It controls Tibet and has a sphere of 
<BR>
influence on its periphery. It's by no means a disorganized horde. (I'm not 
<BR>
about to glaze over taking about the Yellow Peril. I'm just recognizing that 
<BR>
China is organized and has its own agenda apart from reacting to US policy.)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I agree that the United States is not another great &quot;tragedy of empire&quot; 
<BR>
story.  The Roman or British examples do not really compare to us.  I was 
<BR>
just going on a riff inspired by Robert Owens comments.  China is an empire 
<BR>
in its own right but when I compared them to'barbarian hordes' I meant just 
<BR>
in the sense that they were a oncoming challenge to us (Visigoths coming our 
<BR>
way) in that they are economically, technologically and militarily behind us 
<BR>
but hell-bent to catch up and become a major power that has similar global 
<BR>
clout.  'Rival power seeking parity' would be the better term.
<BR>
<P>I have really enjoyed reading the many posts on this topic.  Is this simply 
<BR>
a case of the most powerful nation in the world looking out for its 
<BR>
'national interests' rather then engaging in 'neo-imperialism' or 
<BR>
'neo-colonialism'?  And because we are so powerful do we simply achieve our 
<BR>
'national interests' that much more effectively then other, less-powerful 
<BR>
nations?
<BR>
<P>When I see U.S. corporations exploiting third world people by having them 
<BR>
work long hours in dangerous conditions and for at best low to average wages 
<BR>
based on the local area, I wonder how this cannot be economic 
<BR>
neo-colonialism?  Of course we are not the only nation to do this but does 
<BR>
that make it right?
<BR>
<P>I love my country very much (even if it is politically incorrect to say so) 
<BR>
but know there is much room for improvement.  Many U.S. citizens are just 
<BR>
too complacent in a nation where our politicians are largely cowed under by 
<BR>
soft money election funds that can make or break them.  Then again, many 
<BR>
citizens are so busy in their own lives making a living and raising a family 
<BR>
that they do not have the time or interest to get involved in the big 
<BR>
picture.

Thanks to greedy corporations and a corrupt government our country  that has 
<BR>
an ample territory, endless natural resources, and a key position, we are 
<BR>
the bridge between north and latin america and now we are also the bridge 
<BR>
between Europe, Asia and the usa, and our country and economy has been 
<BR>
modernizing at a giant step, however our economy hasn't fulfilled it's 
<BR>
potencial yet, because nobody cares about the needs or desires of our 
<BR>
population, everybody just wants to get rich quick, and they manipulate our 
<BR>
economy to fill their needs and U.S. Corporate world plays a big role on 
<BR>
this.

<P>Mexico is a very blessed land and you are very self-aware that many of its 
<BR>
problems have been brought on by itself.  The old saying goes, &quot;a nation 
<BR>
gets the government they deserve.&quot;  This says alot about both Mexico and the 
<BR>
United States for both good and bad.
<BR>
<P>In latin America especially though, there tends to be a lack of loyalty and 
<BR>
common identity to bind together the populace in working together and 
<BR>
mutually benefitting eachother.  Is this a by-product of the class 
<BR>
structures introduced by the initial European colonizers?  Loyalty only to 
<BR>
one's own social class?  This is becoming a real concern in the U.S. also.
<BR>
<P>I read in a recent issue of _The Futurist_ magazine about three possible 
<BR>
paths Mexico could take over the next few decades.  One scenario was very 
<BR>
positive and encouraged economic growth and democracy, the other was 
<BR>
business as usual and the last was a nosedive into economic and political 
<BR>
squalor.  I hope you can read the article yourself at their website if it is 
<BR>
available.
