The Christians are likely to paint it as part of the great world domination 
<BR>
plot of the anti-Christ and attempt to have it illegalized (or at least turn 
<BR>
a blind eye to anti-abortion style bombings of nano-labs).)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>To be fair to Christians I will say that the majority would see nanotech as 
<BR>
a great boon for humanity which would eventually be perverted by the 
<BR>
antichrist who would use it in his bid for world domination.  I don't see 
<BR>
militant antagonism from mainstream Christianity, such as has occured over 
<BR>
abortion.
<BR>
<P>I have an evangelical friend who was reading a book published from one of 
<BR>
the major Christian publishing houses.  I cannot remember the title or 
<BR>
author but I read on the back how the writer felt Christianity as a whole 
<BR>
had a negative view of science that needed to be changed.  I found that very 
<BR>
interesting.
<BR>
<P>I think most would cautiously welcome the tide of advances.  I could see Hal 
<BR>
Lindsey and the Lalonde brothers producing numerous tv shows and books to 
<BR>
explain their take on these developments in light of their beliefs.
<BR>
<P>Nanotech and A.I. could be used so extremely well to explain the types of 
<BR>
horrors described in Revelation.  For instance, consider the description in 
<BR>
scripture of a creature that causes such agonizing pain that people beg for 
<BR>
death but just cannot kill themselves.  A nano weapon could inflict such 
<BR>
horror to bring a population to it's knees.
<BR>
<P>Also the Bible talks of a giant statue of the antichrist that comes to life 
<BR>
and the people of the world are astonished.  Again, nano and A.I. could do 
<BR>
this task.
<BR>
<P>Lastly, the antichrist is said to be assassinated but rises from the grave.  
<BR>
Medical nano could allow such a happening.  If the technology is still 
<BR>
experimental and not widely known about it would cause shockwaves.  Even if 
<BR>
widely used it would be a momentous event for a world leader to defy death 
<BR>
and an assassin like that.

The Christian on the other hand... only cares to preserve the meme of God's 
<BR>
&quot;mysterious ways&quot;, in other words, non-interference by man. They fear being 
<BR>
caused to question their ideas, and would easily discount even the most 
<BR>
logical argument for technology, if it threatened the meme itself.  It's 
<BR>
inherantly anti-reality and therefore much more difficult to combat.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Christians along with just about everyone else love the fruits of applied 
<BR>
science, especially to spread their message and also to be fair, to reach 
<BR>
out to the poor and sick throughout the globe.  While much evil has been 
<BR>
done in the name of religion, also so much good has been done too.
<BR>
<P>Christianity may go through some interesting changes over the next century 
<BR>
as technology transforms society.  And Christianity may have some very 
<BR>
transforming effects on society also...
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
