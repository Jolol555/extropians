<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt; What I'm fairly certain [uploaded life] *won't* be like is Captain
</EM><BR>
Future zooming
<BR>
<EM>&gt; through the asteroid belt in her souped-up space chariot, having
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stereotyped visceral thrills galore, or even teleporting to the stars for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more of the same.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;why not? zooming should be easy wihtout the physics.... or are we going to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mock physics?
</EM><BR>
<P>Work with me here, QM. What I'm asserting - since trying to prove the
<BR>
almost imponderable is a waste of time - is that quite quickly the
<BR>
condition of the uploaded will be so very strange that such comic strip
<BR>
fantasies will have as much plausibility as the speculations of two
<BR>
bacteria discussing life as a kidney.
