<P><EM>&gt; Elephants are supposed to go through many molars but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  the replacment function is limited (whether by genetics or failure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of the replacement tissue is unclear),
</EM><BR>
<P>Elephants are born with 5 molars; each wears out
<BR>
and is replaced by the next.  When the last wears
<BR>
out, the elephants dies.  So it's both, really;
<BR>
the proximate cause is failure of the replacement
<BR>
tissue (the extra molars) but clearly a genetic change 
<BR>
(probably a small one; molar count varies among great 
<BR>
apes) could give them an extra 1 or 2.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In humans it isn't so much tooth loss
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;but failure of taste &amp; smell (leading to decreased interest in food)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and failure of the gut (leading to decreased nutrient absorption).
</EM><BR>
<P>In us, yes, but in our hunter-gatherer ancestors tooth loss might have been
<BR>
a big problem.  Since their lives are largely responsible for our genes, our
<BR>
&quot;aging&quot; genes might be tuned for near-certain death shortly after middle
<BR>
age even though that no longer applies to us.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Yep, but the nice thing about nature is that we have examples of genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;programs that solve some of these problems.  Humans can &quot;borrow&quot; the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tooth replacement strategy of elephants or even better sharks.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;anti-cancer program of elephants or whales also would be useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Very.  We have tolerable mechanical replacements for teeth, but cancer
<BR>
is still very bad news.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Precisely.  To solve aging you have to knock off the problems one by one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;As you solve each, you will reveal something that was previously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;unnoticed.  Fortunately we have enough insights at this point that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we can work on the problems simultaneously.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true even if there *is* a single genetic cause for &quot;aging&quot;.
