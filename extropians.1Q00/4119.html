I'm afraid I can't completely share your optimism, at least initially. Many 
<BR>
things on the Extropian agenda could potentially come under legal purview. 
<BR>
Christian groups have been shown to be highly effective lobbyists, and have 
<BR>
not been hesitant to block the approval of medical innovations which 
<BR>
challenged &quot;traditional values.&quot; Good examples of this would be RU486, late 
<BR>
term abortions, and assisted suicide. And the problems won't be just with 
<BR>
evangelists. The bozos that were sounding the alarms about the UPC code 
<BR>
(and remember Ronald Wilson Reagan = 666?) weren't the same heavy hitters 
<BR>
(e.g. bishops and leaders of major denominations) that would get into the 
<BR>
fray when you start talking about totally redefining basic terms such as 
<BR>
&quot;life&quot; or &quot;intelligence&quot; and even assigning god-like attributes to 
<BR>
machines. Various legitimate ethical questions will undoubtedly be 
<BR>
approached from biblical perspectives, as absurd as such a juxtaposition 
<BR>
may seem, which could well have at least a da!
<BR>
!
<BR>
mpening effect. Like it or not, the religious types are very effective 
<BR>
organizers, and can do much to influence our freedoms. I think we'd better 
<BR>
get really used to hearing the accusation &quot;playing God.&quot;

I think there would initially be an outcry from the Christian fringe.  But 
<BR>
eventually it would probably quiet down.  I remember reading some Christian 
<BR>
propaganda about 20 years ago warning the faithful about the dangers of 
<BR>
computers and raising a ruckus about the fact that there was a 
<BR>
supercomputer in Europe nick-named &quot;The Beast.&quot;  Later the big scare was 
<BR>
UPC codes as precursors to the prophesied &quot;mark of the beast.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Eventually the panic died down and now that everything you buy has UPC 
<BR>
codes on it Christians are as big consumers as any other segment in the 
<BR>
US.  Also, any televangelist worth his holy collection plate now has his 
<BR>
own web site.  So much for the holy technophobes.
