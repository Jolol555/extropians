<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;This does not even touch on the issue of whether voting districts 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;neutral to all these differences.  I believe they should be -- viz., 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;the government should NOT legally recognize races, ethnics groups,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;etc. --
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;though I do not here offer an alternative plan.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The obvious alternative plan is to completely *ignore* race.  The color 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; your skin should have the same impact on your voting district (as well 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; every other right, privilege, opportunity, etc.) as the color of your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eyes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and hair.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Didn't I write that above!?!  Reread it.  Let me retyped it:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;I believe... that the government should NOT legally recognize races,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ethnics groups, etc.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My saying I did not offer an alternative plan meant that I do not have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plan for districting.  What this means is, Yes, I'm against basing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;districts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on race, ethnicity, and the like, but this does not tell me or anyone how 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make districts.  Should they be based on what districts were in the past?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Should they be random?  Should they be geographical?  Should people living
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in, say, Manhattan be placed in the same district with people in the Bronx?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How should all this be decided?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Being against racial and ethnic voting discrimination does not magically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conjure up a plan.
</EM><BR>
<P>Oh, so you can't figure out how to reconfigure voting districts irrespective 
<BR>
of the racial component of the constituents?  Me neither.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Although I must admit that I'd be in favor of granting certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; historically exploited peoples (native americans, slave descendants)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;reparations&quot; in the form of reduced (or even free) college tuition for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;kids
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; who academically qualify but cannot afford the tuition.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I would be against this.  Native Americans should have as much land 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;returned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them as is possible and can be found to belong to them.  Slavery was over a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;long time.  Can't undo the past and there's no justification to tax people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who had nothing to do with it -- such as, e.g., the descendants of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Europeans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who immigrated to the US after the Civil War.  (Not to mention, if you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to talk slavery, When will the Irish sue the English for reparations?  How
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about all those peoples the Soviets dominated for all those decades?  What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about Mexicans and Cubans litigating against Spain?  Etc.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Instead, I advocate rabid individualism and foaming at the mouth free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;markets to overcome all these problems.  (Of course, this won't overcome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all, but it will do much better than wealth redistribution and new welfare
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;programs.  Look, after all, at what the War on Poverty did for the people 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was supposed to help.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, a lot of folks could gripe about &quot;somebody done done me wrong.&quot;  And I 
<BR>
suppose many people would argue that they are just as entitled to some 
<BR>
handouts as Indians and blacks.  I'm sure there are a million and one points 
<BR>
to be made on each side of the issue and admittedly I haven't thought them 
<BR>
all through.  But to me it would just feel right giving poor Indian and 
<BR>
black kids an educational leg up.  But, then again, I suppose that with the 
<BR>
new tuition free Cyber-University we'll soon have...tuition?!?  We don't 
<BR>
need no stinkin' tuition!
