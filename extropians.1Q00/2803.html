[ Sasha talking to himself on The List:   :-) ]
<BR>
<P>Usually, medical procedures performed on the elderly
<BR>
are associated with life extension.  My previous message
<BR>
suggests that life can be extended and enriched better if
<BR>
this money was spent in younger years.
<BR>
<P>The same can be said about long-term effects of the
<BR>
&quot;longevity research&quot;.  There is definitely more life
<BR>
extension potential in studies how to keep people
<BR>
healthy, happy and strong for as long as possible
<BR>
(and hopefully getting better and better at everything
<BR>
imaginable as time goes on), and on cryonics for those
<BR>
(soon to be increasingly rare) cases when people still
<BR>
can't be cured, than on equipment maintaining painful
<BR>
lives of rapidly and irreversibly decaying bodies.
<BR>
<P>If at least younger people started spending their money
<BR>
on their own health and education, and on research in actual
<BR>
life extension technology, instead of investing into
<BR>
disability insurance, conventional life extension industry,
<BR>
social security, and retirement funds, they would most likely
<BR>
not need disability support, social security, and retirement -
<BR>
they would have indefinite life spans filled with fun and
<BR>
productive work.
<BR>
<P>- You get what you invest into...
<BR>
<P>(Unfortunately, as in vaccinations and democracy, the results
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;here depend on the numbers, and everyone gets what the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;majority deserves.)
