<P><EM>&gt; What is the BIG solution?  Is that the resurrection of everybody who has 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  ever lived?  I've heard a little bit of discussion on that.  But I'm not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  convinced.  In order to do that it seems to me that you'd have to recreate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  almost all of a person's subjective experiences.  Sure a lot can be 
</EM><BR>
inferred 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  from accurate data about the person's recorded or remembered words and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  deeds.  But once the brain has undergone dissolution, the great majority 
</EM><BR>
of 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  its patterns are in all likelihood lost forever.  I'd like to think it 
</EM><BR>
ain't 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  so, but I just can't wrap my brain around any convincing argument to that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  effect.

Yes, most people are sane enough to abandon that pursuit, and wisely so.  Yet 
<BR>
I chose to suspect, for want of a better word, that there may be some variety 
<BR>
of storage process embedded in the cosmos. Its just a hunch. For example, 
<BR>
physicist, Leonard Susskind, toyed with the idea if information was 
<BR>
permanently lost within Black Holes? His answer, from a mathematical physics 
<BR>
point of view is that it was, indeed, recoverable; at least conceptually.  
<BR>
Now would Susskind state that the human personality, memory &amp; and physical 
<BR>
structure could be resurrected, given the immensely advanced technology of 
<BR>
the Year Trillion?  My guess is  that the good professor would run shrieking 
<BR>
down the hall to get away from such non-sense.  He might be right.
