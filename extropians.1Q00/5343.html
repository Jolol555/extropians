<P>
<EM>&gt; Octavio, don't misinterpret me, I'm not saying that US foreign policy 
</EM><BR>
is the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; best.  I'm just trying to point out that it is *not* imperialism.  To 
</EM><BR>
call
<BR>
<EM>&gt; America &quot;imperialist&quot; is merely to reveal your own displeasure over 
</EM><BR>
its
<BR>
<EM>&gt; policies and to use the same sort of hyperbolic rhetoric as the 
</EM><BR>
pro-gun
<BR>
<EM>&gt; folks who refer to gun-control proponents as &quot;fascists.&quot;  It doesn't 
</EM><BR>
further
<BR>
<EM>&gt; your cause, it doesn't foster constructive dialogue, and makes you 
</EM><BR>
come
<BR>
<EM>&gt; across as reactionary.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Just my dos centavos.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; -Zero

<P><EM>&gt; &quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; --Thomas Jefferson
</EM><BR>
<P>Zero, your point is valid, maybe the word imperialism isn't the most 
<BR>
appropriate
<BR>
and due to the connotations it has it doesn't really define what the 
<BR>
U.S. Does
<BR>
with foreign countries. Although I still disagree with a lot of the 
<BR>
policies
<BR>
it would be a lot worse if it was true imperialism.
<BR>
<P>And by the way concerning free press you are right, our press is a lot 
<BR>
worse
<BR>
and at least the press in the usa, isn't completely controlled by the 
<BR>
government
<BR>
and the information is more veritable. However the press still
<BR>
likes to exaggerate or condemn some things depending a lot of 
<BR>
interests or
<BR>
the bias of the writer (like all the gm foods fud, etc.) fortunately
<BR>
with thereabouts uncensored, multicultural Internet, people is 
<BR>
starting
<BR>
to know more about the bad things our governments do than before, and 
<BR>
I believe
<BR>
the chances in our society this technologies (and the ones that are 
<BR>
still emerging)
<BR>
bring won't have precedents with anything we've seen before... And 
<BR>
it'll be very funny
<BR>
to see how the governments try to control them (like Chinese 
<BR>
government does with the
<BR>
Internet)
<BR>
<P>By the way it would be interesting to know your opinion, and that of 
<BR>
the rest of the list
<BR>
about us foreign policies, specially the ones that hurt the relation 
<BR>
between America and
<BR>
it's neighbors or commercial partners. Specially how different it is 
<BR>
between us 
<BR>
and non us citizens.
