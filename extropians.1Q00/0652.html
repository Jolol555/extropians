<P>I'd agree with most of what you said.  You have to factor in that the
<BR>
astronomy capabilities of advanced civilizations do let you very
<BR>
rapidly determine go (meaning really &quot;dead&quot;) or no-go (posessing
<BR>
potential for or having life) status for observable objects.  Computational
<BR>
capacities probably let you project this into the future (at least
<BR>
the delivery time for any probes).  So you likely know ahead of time
<BR>
whether you would be sending a &quot;development&quot; probe, or an &quot;observation
<BR>
&amp; potential contact&quot; probe.  This process extends out to the limits
<BR>
of dust limiting your observations and/or computational projections
<BR>
relative to probe delivery times.  The constraint is the uncertainty
<BR>
thrown in by pre-tech civilizations going that are *nearer* to the
<BR>
destination going through the Spike before your probes can arrive.
<BR>
That probably limits your predictability and therefore your colonization
<BR>
horizon.

<EM>&gt; I have not had the pleasure of reading Robert Freitas's &quot;Xenology&quot;, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would most certainly like to.  Robert (Bradbury), is it available online?

We have just about finished the hypertext conversion process.  I'd guess
<BR>
it would be semi-polished by Feb 2K.  One of the things we were trying
<BR>
to do is figure out how to publish it.  When it was written (~1979)
<BR>
it was way ahead of its time.  It still holds most of its value though
<BR>
needs some updating in places.  Unfortunately, neither I nor Robert have
<BR>
the time to go through it and rewrite it.  So the question is how do
<BR>
you publish a dusty manuscript and use it for the Author's benefit?
<BR>
There are several e-book publishing ideas coming out from MSoft &amp; Adobe
<BR>
but we aren't sure whether these will be the right approach.  We are
<BR>
thinking perhaps electronic pay-for-access.  Or perhaps we just
<BR>
do something where if you contribute to the Nanomedicine support fund
<BR>
at the Foresight Inst. you get free access.  (My main interest here
<BR>
is in seeing the Robert gets supported enough to spend the next 5+
<BR>
years finishing Nanomedicine volumes II &amp; III.)
<BR>
Any suggestions or pointers are appreciated.
<BR>
<P>Robert
