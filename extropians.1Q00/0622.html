In response to my comments:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, on the biotech front, we are going to have progammable, self-replicating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; machines *very* soon (1-3 years).  The only problem will be they will not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; general purpose...

<EM>&gt; I think you're way too optimistic here. If we can get protein folding
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; licked, then modification is suddenly doable. Then you can look at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protein/DNA interaction, design new enzymes from scratch, etc.

<P>I may be, but so were the Wright Brothers... :-)
<BR>
Let me be clear about what I am saying.  I'm not talking about designing
<BR>
any *new* capabilities (new enzymes, etc.).  I'm only talking about
<BR>
taking existing tools and putting them together in novel and useful ways.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Before that you can't predict the impact of your changes without doing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actual (expensive, slow) experiment.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the typical experiment is slow (a day or two), but if you can do 1000
<BR>
of them in parallel, then all you are concerned with is what 1000 to do and
<BR>
how to do them cheaply.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You still need a full cell model
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to tackle the hard stuff like embryomorphogenesis and such, but that's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the logical next step after solving PFP.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm going to let the Zebrafish people work that all out before I go near it.
<BR>
For my purposes, I don't think I need to understand it, I simply have to
<BR>
put the pieces together so they work well together.  Its a children's
<BR>
puzzle where you have to build a cube out of a little of funny 3D pieces.
<BR>
You simply have to prune the problem appropriately so you don't have to
<BR>
try all of the possible assembly combinations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If I'd hazard a timeline I'd place reasonably competent genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering capability at two decades downstream.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would probably agree, if you mean &quot;comptency&quot; implies understanding what
<BR>
the pieces you are working with actually &quot;do&quot;.  However, I don't care what
<BR>
they do so long as I can get them to work together effectively.  The nice
<BR>
thing about nature is that many &quot;standard&quot; problems have been solved
<BR>
multiple times, if one approach doesn't work, just choose another.
