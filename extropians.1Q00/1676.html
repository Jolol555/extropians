<EM>&gt; &gt;what is it in the conscious organization that is viewed as irreconcilable

<EM>&gt; &gt;with this idea, such that if the unconscious correlate were to gain

<EM>&gt; I don't find the background psychodynamics in this formulation all that

<EM>&gt; convincing, so I can't usefully comment. But clearly something along at

<P>What would be your explanation of the classic case of Saul of Tarsus?
<BR>
Obviously, he felt threatened by the Primitive Christian Movement, and
<BR>
the notion that Jesus was the Messiah. His corresponding behavioral
<BR>
peculiarity was his ruthless and &quot;*extremely angry*&quot; persecution of
<BR>
Christians, so excessive that even some Pharisees thought it was a
<BR>
bit much.  Then, lightning, the horse, blindness, the Voice, and, presto
<BR>
chango, we have Paul the Christian Knight (or Zealot) whose new mission
<BR>
in life was to liberate Christianity from onerous Hebrew customs and
<BR>
oppressive Pharisaic legalism.  Innumerable similar examples can be
<BR>
cited -- from the sublime to the ridiculous (&quot;There is nothing worse than
<BR>
a reformed drunk.&quot;)
<BR>
<P>The &quot;psychodynamic&quot; I mentioned is basically the human-all-too-human
<BR>
fatal fascination with the unthinkable. Scratch any fanatic or zealot and
<BR>
inside you will meet the enemy who is himself.
