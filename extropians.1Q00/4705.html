<EM>&gt; Speaking of that...  How about patents and copyrights on bad ideas to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them out of circulation?:)  Pruning the meme tree?  Sounds like an idea for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science fiction farce....
</EM><BR>
<P>I recall a famous case of this a decade back, when someone patented a
<BR>
machine to keep a human head alive.  The head would be hooked up to a
<BR>
heart-lung machine, the blood would go through dialysis, etc.  The stated
<BR>
intention was to make sure this horrible-sounding technology would never
<BR>
be used (at least not for 17 years).
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately in my searches of the web and of patent databases I have
<BR>
not been able to come up with keywords to locate the patent.  Does anyone
<BR>
know the number or name, or any more details?
