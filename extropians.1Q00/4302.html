<EM>&gt; Like I said before, I'm sure barter could be an effective technique for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting away with tax evasion.  My point, however, was that simply using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; barter instead of cash changes nothing at all about the legality of failing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to report any given transaction.  If you want to give it a try that's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly your call, but less intrepid souls should be aware of the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that simply avoiding money doesn't exempt them from prosecution.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>I suggest you look over this page and its linked pages before you make such a
<BR>
conclusion.

<BR>
<P>The whole problem with taxing barter exchanges is the presumption that the
<BR>
government has a right to part of your property, which is clearly
<BR>
unconstitutional. The government has a right to tax transactions involving money
<BR>
because the money is a security instrument of the government. The traditional
<BR>
right of government to tax interstate trade is threefold: a) because money from
<BR>
different financial institutions or governments was involved, and b) because
<BR>
trade flowed through the publicly owned waterways which were maintained by the
<BR>
Coast Guard and the Corps fo Engineers, and c) the government typically provided
<BR>
police protection on the roads and in the markets.
<BR>
<P>An internet based barter system would evade all of these bases:
<BR>
a) the internet (at least in the US) is completely private, the government owns
<BR>
none of it.
<BR>
b) the barter marketplace is a privately maintained entity that provides for its
<BR>
own security and indemnification through encryption and insurance
<BR>
c) barter transactions will not use the fiat money issued by the federal reserve
<BR>
or securities offered by the Treasury
<BR>
d) any real goods would be transported via private shipping companies.
<BR>
c) because no government issued money is involved, there is no rational basis to
<BR>
evaluate the value of a given exchange, and it is illegal for the government to
<BR>
arrive at its own arbitrary evaluations without a factual basis for the
<BR>
valuation. Given the obvious variability in the value of the items or services
<BR>
exchanged it is impossible to calculate a rational amount of capital gains or
<BR>
profit, and exchanges without profit (i.e. both parties received 'fair value' in
<BR>
what they regarded as an even trade) cannot be taxed in any event.
<BR>
<P>There is a distinct difference between a 'trade' and a 'sale'. A 'sale' implies
<BR>
the use of money as a media of exchange, and a government has a right to tax
<BR>
such transactions. A government also has the right to tax any profit made on
<BR>
such transactions. However if you have an apple, and I have an apple, and we
<BR>
each like each other's apple more than the one we have, and we trade evenly,
<BR>
then there is no profit, and no exchange of money, and no sale.
<BR>
<P>Given these criteria, there is no legal basis for a government to claim a right
<BR>
of taxation over modern barter transactions
