<EM>&gt; I already tossed my census form in the garbage, but if I hadn't, this report
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; certainly would make me do so.  Of course, reports like this are merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indicitive of our government in less enlightened, less progressive times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nothing like this could ever happen now, right?

<EM>&gt; Census Bureau Role Reported in Internment of Japanese-Americans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; By STEVEN A. HOLMES
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; WASHINGTON -- Two scholars say in a new research paper that despite earlier
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; denials, the Census Bureau was deeply involved in the roundup and internment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Japanese-Americans at the onset of American entry into World War II.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like the propaganda war has begun. Which way do asian americans
<BR>
(esp japanese americans) lean? Dem or GOP? Who ever they tend against is
<BR>
probably putting out these stories to reduce the reporting from these
<BR>
demographic groups, since congressional district remappings are
<BR>
determined by census data. Considering that the census is trying to
<BR>
really discriminate (emphasis) between members of the different asian,
<BR>
polynesian, and hispanic groups, I wouldn't be surprised that some
<BR>
disinformation comes out about how bad the census is for those groups
<BR>
too.
