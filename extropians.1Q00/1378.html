<EM>&gt;          &quot;[nihilism] is essentially an anti-monarchical/

<P>Correct; I had read the sentence as &quot;[atheism] is essentially, 
<BR>
etc.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;This sentence is true in fact and not true by definition.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll take your word for that, although that's not a connection
<BR>
that pops up in may mind.
<BR>
<P>However, I still question why you would place nihilism and 
<BR>
atheism closely together.  The sentence above is the evidence
<BR>
you provide for this assertion.  So a discredited, now-unpopular
<BR>
movement was both nihilistic and atheistic.  So?  You can
<BR>
find *some* marginal movement combining almost any two concepts.
<BR>
The Communist movement defined neither atheism nor nihilism,
<BR>
and now that it's basically on the ash heap of history, I
<BR>
don't think it's redefinition attempts are relevant.
