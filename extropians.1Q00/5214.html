<EM>&gt; &quot;EvMick is cruising down the road in his new hypertruck, one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things going is his new GPS based ECN. (electronic commerce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; network) As he drives along he not only gets route info, but every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fuel stop is displayed along with it's real time prices. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; display is colorcoded (red,yellow,green) so EvMick can see at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; glance which stations are in range. Noting that he's going to need
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a fillup, Mick spots a likely vendor on his screen, with a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quick keystrokes he submits a bid for a hundred or so gallons at a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; price a few cents below his posted price.
</EM><BR>
<P>This would be great, even without the haggling.  I'd love it if I could
<BR>
get price comparisons for gasoline and other products while travelling.
<BR>
In fact, I'd like to be able to do it at home.  Do the various
<BR>
&quot;sidewalks.com&quot; type local portals provide this kind of information?
<BR>
Probably not, that would require some actual work by the portal rather
<BR>
than just passing on what the vendors tell them.
<BR>
<P>By itself this kind of information would help to keep prices down and make
<BR>
the market more competitive.  It is already happening with online sales.
<BR>
Hopefully we will see some progress in this direction for local physical
<BR>
sales in the next few years.
