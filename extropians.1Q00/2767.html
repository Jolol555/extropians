<EM>&gt; &gt; If the government defaults on its debt, which is to some extent made up of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; T-bonds bought by the should-be Social Security escrow, then when that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; happens then there would be no more Social Security, and all of those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; citizens having given the government peacefully their FICA taxes in return
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for expectation of minimal retirement income would find themselves bereft.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's my point, the way the system is setup, the government is promising
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to take from the future generations to support the retirement of the current
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or past generations).  Now, I believe they will worm out of this by allowing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an expansion of retirement accounts and a pseudo-privitization of the S.S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system allowing you to manage your own retirement.
</EM><BR>
<P>INdexing the retirement age to the average life expectancy will also be a
<BR>
necessary reform to stabilize the system as longevity increases. I do hope though
<BR>
that they apply as much of these surpluses to paying down the debt as soon as
<BR>
possible. Reducing the interest overhead by paying down the principal will go a
<BR>
long way to staving off instability when the boomers retire.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now, if at some point the government hands you or sees the development of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an &quot;almost anything&quot; box forthcoming, then it may feel free to eliminate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social security.  [It would have to substantially change the form anyway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because there may be *many* fewer people working. (see below).]  Sure,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some people will be annoyed, but the government can point out that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is no longer needed.  Since much of the National Debt has been bought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by the S.S. trust funds, the accounts cancel each other out.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd like to see a breakdown of the fraction of the National Debt owed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to private citizens or corporations vs. the amount the government owes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the S.S. fund(s).
</EM><BR>
<P>As I recall, the big year that SS started buying federal debt in earnest was 1987
<BR>
or 88, which was a big question I was bugging Bush with during the primaries
<BR>
here. As I recall, we were at 3.5 or 4 trillion  in debt at that point. SS
<BR>
typically buys up all of the debt that isn't sold at auction. private (corporate
<BR>
and union) and state pension funds are supposedly the largest stakeholders in
<BR>
federal debt.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I agree that growth is in a long term upswing, but planning on it is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; invitation to inflation.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No!!!  The huge productivity increases allowed by the &quot;A.A.&quot; boxes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should prevent any inflation.  The key thing is do you have *growth*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in excess of inflation. You might even get &quot;deflation&quot; because once
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;A.A.&quot; boxes make you one of everything you need, you aren't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going to be buying much in terms of raw materials.
</EM><BR>
<P>The only invitation to inflation is built in COLA raises that are in excess of
<BR>
the true increases in the CPI.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Properly directed government funding is that towards research and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; development, as far as I know the only indicator of increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; productivity, that is the rate of increase in productivity is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; linearly and positively linked to R&amp;D.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Nope, we've discussed this before, the rate of increase in things
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like Medline articles is exponential (with a moderately low exponent).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You can probably go back through the archives for last year and find
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discussions by Robin or myself on this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Well, people will grow older, and be older longer.  Social Security will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have to be reformed, as is evidenced by rising retirement ages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yep, raise them now to make it &quot;look&quot; good and not send people into
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a panic and then eliminate the entire program sometime down the road.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Health care costs would be a rising burden, that would have to be solved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's why its important to distinguish between health care treatments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that &quot;fix&quot; problems (e.g. replacement organs or gene therapies) vs.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; treatments that &quot;manage&quot; problem (e.g. drugs).  You have to invest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in &quot;fixes&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; At least by that time contemporary drug patents would be expired so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the government could be mandated to purchase &quot;generic&quot; drugs in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; majority of necessary cases.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, but you still want investments (public &amp; private) in things that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; eliminate problems on a long term basis.  Think about a syn-immune
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; system that recognizes all known viruses and bacteria and deals with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them efficiently without causing things like septic shock (which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kills a fairly large number of people each year).
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not one to advocate socialization of medicine, but has anyone noticed that
<BR>
drugs which are WAY past the expiration date on their patent rights now cost ten
<BR>
to twenty times what they cost when they were patent protected? Pennicillin is
<BR>
one good example.
