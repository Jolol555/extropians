<P><EM>&gt;Just shows to go you how subtle language is -- what you took as the primary 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and obvious meaning of your phrase would be a secondary and very 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;context-driven one in American English (but would have been consistent with 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the British usage, I believe). 
</EM><BR>
<P>Not wishing to beat this horse into the ground... but--
<BR>
<P>I should have reminded everyone that *my* odd (?) use of the phrase was
<BR>
just a direct, unaltered recycling of *Sasha's*. He had written:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;(I like reminding people that out of millions of animal 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species, humans are the only one who have any problem seeing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;each other naked
</EM><BR>
<P>Now I assume that while Sasha is a Russian-American (right?) whose English
<BR>
usage therefore might be a bit skewed, Americans surely didn't suppose that
<BR>
he was saying that humans are plagued by a high frequency of nakedness, or
<BR>
hysterical blindness. He meant, as I meant, that (many/most) humans are
<BR>
*worried by it*. The difference was that Sasha took this worry to be
<BR>
neurotic; I was trying to situate it in a social context that made it more
<BR>
understandable/functional. E.g., we worry about people cheating on term
<BR>
papers (something few lions or ants get their knickers in a twist abt)
<BR>
(`knickers' are underpants), not just because we are obsessively anal types
<BR>
but because there's something at stake.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I'm blaming Sasha for all this. :)
