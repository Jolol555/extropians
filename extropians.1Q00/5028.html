<EM> &gt;      &gt; Remember, one of the first acts of the Klinton administration was to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; cancel
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;      &gt; Argonne Labs' Integral Fast Reactor project, just before the 
</EM><BR>
technology
<BR>
<EM> &gt;      &gt; demonstrator unit was to go on line.

<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; A good move, otherwise it would have been an even bigger white elephant than
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the space shuttle. It just makes no economic sense. The thing's claim to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; fame is its
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ability to turn common U238 into Plutonium in a very big way, but there's
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; already a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; glut of Plutonium in the world. Unfortunately.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;      &gt; This design was touted as being inherently safe,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I don't think that's true. A breeder has a much higher energy density than
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a regular
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; reactor and that means it's inherently more dangerous.
</EM><BR>
<P>John, you are making an assertion without evidence. France's entire nuke 
<BR>
program
<BR>
is made up of breeder reactors, which are also capable of burning off nuclear
<BR>
waste. Thats why France has nowhere near the waste problem we do, even 
<BR>
though they
<BR>
have far more plants than we do.
