<P>
So, it appears from the mass media that Microsoft is under consideration
<BR>
of being split.  This would be the wrong approach to promoting
<BR>
competition.
<BR>
<P>Splitting Microsoft horizontally or vertically would not benefit any
<BR>
other company or group.  Any kind of enforcement of non-collusion among
<BR>
the resultant entities would be impossible.
<BR>
<P>The correct route would be to open Microsoft's, and therefore, a large
<BR>
percentage of computer users', software source code.  What this means is
<BR>
providing free reference entry-level compilers and tools and the source
<BR>
code of the operating system and reference documentation and
<BR>
specifications of the entire operating system and commodity office
<BR>
software.  This would benefit competition by allowing the majority of
<BR>
programmers outside of Microsoft, and thus, their related business
<BR>
competition interests, better ability to develop software for their
<BR>
mission critical applications.
<BR>
<P>When it comes to development tools, there should be made available a
<BR>
freely distributable fully-functional reference compiler and requisite
<BR>
tools.  Microsoft and others could still sell their higher level
<BR>
development environments.
<BR>
<P>In terms of the operating system itself, &quot;Windows&quot;, the source code
<BR>
should be made available to any licensee upon request.  They could
<BR>
expressly disclaim any liability of recompiled or source code, which is
<BR>
not much different from the case now.  Also, enforcement would be as
<BR>
simple as compiling the source code and comparing the checksums to
<BR>
release software.  Also, Microsoft would still be selling this software
<BR>
for a very large profit, as is the case now, considering that an OEM
<BR>
CD-ROM and a hologram sticker cost less than a dollar.
<BR>
<P>That is my opinion, and that of others, who care little about
<BR>
Microsoft's corporate structure or restructure, and want the best in
<BR>
software engineering.  These enforceable actions would be
<BR>
pro-competitive.
