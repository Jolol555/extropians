Spike on bikes:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  I had a thought while riding the other day.  Recumbents have never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  caught on much, but if they had been invented first, I wouldnt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  imagine the now-traditional knd would have caught on . . . .
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  [R]ecumbents are safer, faster, and more comfortable.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Bicycle people, why dont you ride a recumbent?
</EM><BR>
<P>The story of bikes v. 'bents reveals something of the problems facing 
<BR>
technological innovations.  Here's a brief version told from the 'bent point 
<BR>
of view, lifted from the FAQ of the International Human Powered Vehicle 
<BR>
Association &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ihpva.org/FAQ/#around">http://www.ihpva.org/FAQ/#around</A>&gt;:
<BR>
<P>* * *
<BR>
<P>In 1933 Charles Mochet built a supine recumbent named the &quot;Velocar&quot;. Between 
<BR>
the years of 1933 and 1938 pro racer Francois Faure, while riding the 
<BR>
Velocar, set several speed records for both the mile and kilometer. In Paris 
<BR>
on July 7, 1933, Francis Faure broke the 20 year-old hour record of 44.247 
<BR>
km. by going 45.055 km.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately Faure's hour record created a controversy amongst the Union 
<BR>
Cycliste Internationale (U.C.I.), the governing body for bicycle races. The 
<BR>
controversy was based on whether the Velocar was a bicycle and whether the 
<BR>
time records were legal. In February 1934, the U.C.I. decided against Faure's 
<BR>
record and banned all recumbents and aerodynamic devices from racing.
<BR>
<P>That is the reason why recumbents have not gained popularity in the racing 
<BR>
scene, and why they have not been mass produced by bike manufacturers. 
<BR>
<P>* * *
<BR>
<P>Fuller accounts of the tale relate the ugly roles played by nationalism and 
<BR>
industrial protectionism.
<BR>
<P>That said, allow me to note that the diamond frame bike exhibits well-evolved 
<BR>
engineering.  It's a design tested by time and many iterations to satisfy 
<BR>
pretty stringent criteria.  Not for nothing did the Wright brothers run a 
<BR>
bike shop.
<BR>
