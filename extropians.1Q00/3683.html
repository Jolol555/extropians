What I mean is, a mode where one subject or problem holds your attention 
<BR>
strongly to the exclusion of all other objects...

<P>This state is known as &quot;hyperfocus&quot; and is sometimes common for people with 
<BR>
learning disabilities and attention deficit disorder.  They can have trouble 
<BR>
getting focused to begin with but once they do, they lock on like a pit bull 
<BR>
and don't want to let go to the exclusion sometimes of other tasks and even 
<BR>
eating.

if it was possible tocreate a site-specific timed neurodepressant, you could 
<BR>
get the same sort of increased focus you get from, for example, caffeine, to 
<BR>
a much higher degree for a short time... by depressing the brain's 
<BR>
&quot;interrupt factor&quot;. Or, you could play with stimulating it, to keep yourself 
<BR>
out of a rut...
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Prescription only drugs such as ritalin, adderall, cylert and dexadrine 
<BR>
already are designed to do this to at least some extent.  The theory is that 
<BR>
a part of the frontal lobe is underactive for some people and the rest of it 
<BR>
tries to overcompensate for this which creates attention deficit disorder.
<BR>
<P>My understanding is that ritalin and other drugs do not have the beneficial 
<BR>
effects for those without the a.d.d. challenge.  Also ritalin is a 
<BR>
controlled substance being is a central nervous system stimulant, similar to 
<BR>
amphetamines in the nature and duration of its effects.
<BR>
<P>Many people with a.d.d. love their coffee because they find the coffee does 
<BR>
give increased focus where for others it would simply overstimulate.
<BR>
<P>There are other methods to gaining focus.  They range from meditation, 
<BR>
biofeedback (which takes training and some fairly expensive equipment), and 
<BR>
various tapes of white or pink noise that are said to put the mind in a 
<BR>
focused state.  Good luck with finding better ways to focus.
