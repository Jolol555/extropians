It was written:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; I'm not saying that qualia do or do not exist, but if they do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; then it seems reasonable to suggest that there is a mechanism in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; your brain that fools you into thinking you Experience the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; If such a mechanism were found then it would be evidence against the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt; existence of qualia.
</EM><BR>
<P>Brent responded:
<BR>
<EM>&gt;I'd be happy if there we even some rational theory of how this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could be, let alone some way that it actually is.  This doesn't even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seem logically possible to me.  Whatever the representation is, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;is our knowledge, whether it is incorrect or not, these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;representations have phenomenal qualities.  And it is these internal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conscious phenomenal qualities of our knowledge that we are talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about.  It's as if one is arguing that there isn't really any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;representation that is our conscious knowledge, we just consciously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;know things, and this knowledge is mistaken.  How is saying we don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have qualia, it just seems to us that we do, any different?

I'm with you here, Brent. The words &quot;Experience&quot; and &quot;Qualia&quot; are pointers
<BR>
to observed entities. Someone someday decided to name an observed effect
<BR>
&quot;experience&quot; this observed effect still &quot;exists&quot; (contraversial!) and always
<BR>
will. Quibbling with definitions will not make the original observations go
<BR>
away, and saying that &quot;qualia does not exist&quot; will only nullify the label
<BR>
&quot;qualia&quot;, and will simply require a new label for the effect which caused
<BR>
the creation of the word &quot;qualia&quot; in the first place. I propose
<BR>
&quot;Itdoesfuckinexistyoustupidbastards&quot; as the new term. Now back to finding
<BR>
out what it's function might be and what &quot;IT&quot; IS, rather than allowing
<BR>
threatened sophists to remove it from their formerly simplistic model of
<BR>
reality with rabid psuedo-religious denial due to the mind-boggling
<BR>
freakyness such effects present. You never know, seriously hardcore
<BR>
technology may sprout from a calm and humble approach to studying such
<BR>
effects. What's certain is that it is in this direction that the far future
<BR>
of science lies.
<BR>
<P>Also, Dan - you might have guessed from some of the above that I wasn't
<BR>
satisfied with your breakdown of the debate situation - I'll get back to you
<BR>
on it v. soon!
<BR>
<P>Cheers,
<BR>
Rob.
