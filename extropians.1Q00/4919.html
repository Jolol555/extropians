<EM>&gt;From: &quot;John Clark&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:jonkc@worldnet.att.net?Subject=Re:%20Luddites%20are%20everywhere!&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000314225250.47462.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">jonkc@worldnet.att.net</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;In the current issue of Wired magazine is an article I did not expect to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;author expresses great fear over Nanotechnology, computers smarter than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humans, and of course genetic engineering.  After expressing sympathy for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ideas if not the methods of Ted Kaczynski, the mad Unibomber, the author 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;advises
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;limiting our pursuit of certain kinds of knowledge&quot;. The really strange 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thing is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not the content, it's pretty standard Luddite stuff, the bizarre thing is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;author is Bill Joy, chief scientist and cofounder of Sun Microsystems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;It's a little sad to see an attitude like that in the very heart of Silicon 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Valley.
</EM><BR>
<P>I am glad to see this point of view being aired, if for no other reason than 
<BR>
that it will spur further debate.  I am as pro-way-out-tech as anybody on 
<BR>
this list.  But I do share Joy's concern that our pursuit of this tech is 
<BR>
not without *significant* dangers.  I know there are people more 
<BR>
technologically and scientifically literate than me who feel that the 
<BR>
potential dangers are not worrisome enough to warrant stepping back long 
<BR>
enough to make sure that what *can* be done *should* be done.
<BR>
<P>Drexler seems to be very confident in the viability of his nano-shields.  I 
<BR>
am not so confident.  But one thing is certain.  The dangers we face are 
<BR>
potentially extinction-level-event serious.  Drexler, Moravec and Kurzweil 
<BR>
all acknowledge the potential dangers this tech could bring.  That alone is 
<BR>
enough to convince me that we cannot be assurred of smooth sailing as we set 
<BR>
out into these waters.  We probably cannot fully appreciate these dangers 
<BR>
until they are almost upon us.  But it certainly cannot hurt to debate and 
<BR>
debate and debate these issues until we are blue in the face.
<BR>
<P>Kurzweil seems to give us a 50% chance of avoiding our own extinction.  
<BR>
Personally, I don't like those odds.  Heads you get immortality and 
<BR>
unlimited wealth.  Tails you get global sterilization.  I need a little more 
<BR>
convincing before I vote to flip that coin.
