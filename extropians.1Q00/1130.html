<EM>&gt; I used to think that a similar strategy could be employed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against any company whose valuation is based on proprietary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology which could be reengineered for substantially less
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; money than the technology adds to the company's valuation:  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reengineer the technology in secret, short the stock, give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the technology away.  I'm quite skeptical of this idea now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because I think you'd need to create a perfect substitute
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (bug-for-bug in software terms) and do lots of marketing to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ensure your success, both of which require lots of capital. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I love this idea.  I could imagine doing it in the software
<BR>
field specifically, because the cost of engineering a piece
<BR>
of software with certain functionality goes down with time
<BR>
as tools and methods improve, the opportunity for adding
<BR>
features grows, and it is often cheaper to re-engineer a
<BR>
piece of software from scratch than to update it--yet many
<BR>
companies persist in updating software for non-technical
<BR>
reasons to their detriment.  You also have the advantage of
<BR>
not having to support a user base with old hardware, etc.
<BR>
<P>Here's how I'd do it: find one or more companies who have a
<BR>
large market share for a specialized software application
<BR>
that's horribly overpriced (AutoCAD comes to mind for some
<BR>
reason:).  Create a substitute using modern engineering
<BR>
methods.  Make it if not completely compatible at least
<BR>
easy to migrate to from the older system (requiring minimal
<BR>
data translation and retraining).  Short the stock, and
<BR>
start selling it for the minimum price necessary to sustain
<BR>
advertising it.  Short the stock some more, then start
<BR>
giving it away completely.  Invest the money in startup
<BR>
user-support businesses that start springing up to support
<BR>
the free software, then retire.  Simple plan, no?
<BR>
<P>You might not even have to create the software from scratch.
<BR>
Imagine, for example, just cleaning up something like GIMP
<BR>
and porting it to Mac and Windows to undermine Photoshop.
