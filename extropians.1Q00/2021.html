Been there.  My first 20 years were almost entirely spent in an community
<BR>
whose objective was and is, to hasten the rapture by reaching the last
<BR>
unreached indigenous tribe with the Gospel.  This is done at great personal
<BR>
sacrifice.  Many of the most honourable and courageous people I know, choose
<BR>
this way of life, which generally involves a lot more charity than it does
<BR>
preaching.
<BR>
<P>Nevertheless, I now feel kind of silly that we were so carried away with the
<BR>
Rapture.;-D
<BR>
<P>Here's a great doomsday link.

<BR>
<P>P.S.  They only have to be right once.

P.P.S.  Me, me, Regis!  I want to be a millionaire!

Subject: RE: The end of Apocalypses?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;He opined that popular predictions of the apocalypse, the Rapture, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;End of the World, tend to peter out after 2000. In fact, there are no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;religious -- presumably he meant Christian -- predictions of the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the world with deadlines after 2012.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The obvious response to this is a reminder that religions have always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had apocalyptic expectations and mythology---long before, of course, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; approached the year 2000 on a standard calendar.  They faded, were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; revised, or whatever but the apocalyptic inclination persisted.  With
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Christianity particularly intense periods of apocalyptic fervor have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appeared and disappeared; these sometimes centered on dates (for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example, the years 666 and 1000) which, of course, passed without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incident.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Magic dates don't always have to be the focus, though.  Consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Millerites, a vocal Christian sect which was absolutely sure for some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reason that the Rapture would occur on a particular date in 1843, then,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when nothing happened, in 1844.  After a while some people stopped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; listening and the Millerites, fragmenting, learned to not be so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; specific. . . .
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;But the point that interests me is that if the Christians stop jumping
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;up and down shrieking &quot;the sky is falling!&quot; because they're run out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;messianic deadlines, politics and cultural life will take an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;interesting turn.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Doubtful.  If they move away from immediate millenarianism it won't be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because they've given up on the basic idea.  Same for the possibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they accept certain technologies---some religious people have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accepted new technologies in the past because they become ubiquitous and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; part of the culture's fabric.  Many devout Christians today accept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bicycles, movies, and various basic facts about medicine and astronomy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even though these things were once considered abhorrences or heresies by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some.  Certain technologies, however, such as the ones we are expecting,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; challenge religious assumptions more substantially than your average
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Twentieth-century appliances.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The (S/s)ingularity, of course, is a notion which has many of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; qualities of a classic apocalyptic program.  All the religious believers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assure us that their apocalypse is the true one and that yes, this time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it really will happen.  Those of us expecting a singularity or something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like one say the same thing.  But we probably really are right.  At the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very least we have a chance of being right.
</EM><BR>
