<EM>&gt; &gt; The belief system of other people is only a problem for you when, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;because of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that belief system other people feel the need to impact your life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I can't argue your point, Zero, on a purely pragmatic basis.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What you say is true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But I am inclined to hedge here a bit -- what we are talking
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about are &quot;religious&quot; belief systems, and I am not aware that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in any sacred scriptures in the world there is an unambiguous
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;moral command to destroy human life.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Not that these metaphorical documents are not capable of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;infinite interpretation -- certainly the Torah was the basis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the attempted genocide of the Philistines by the Hebrews.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;But this was war, and in a war politicians, generals and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;rest invariably try to legitimize the use of lethal force by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;citing some passage in something that seems to provide
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;religious&quot; justification, i.e. to prove killing is the right thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to do in this case. There is no scriptural basis of any kind
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that states unequivocally that Christians should  bomb
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abortion clinics.  In my view, this is mere rationalization by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sociopaths to justify what they would probably do anyway
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in another connection if they could feel righteous about it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Perhaps this distinction has no practical meaning at all, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for me at least it is quite important spiritually.
</EM><BR>
<P>As you have alluded to, the scriptures are really open to almost *any* 
<BR>
interpretation.  The Bible has been used to support everything from the 
<BR>
Inquisition to conquest of the Americas to the Supremacy of the white race 
<BR>
to mass suicide by poison Kool-Aid.  And the only real &quot;unambiguous moral 
<BR>
command&quot; contained in the Bible is to love God and your neighbor.  Go 
<BR>
figure.
