<EM>&gt; Abominable! Absurd!

I don't consider it to be a &quot;twin&quot; until it begins to accumulate a unique
<BR>
information set (after birth).  Before that it is a collection of cells
<BR>
with a unique (or semi-unique in the case of a identical twin fetuses)
<BR>
genetic program that depending on the length of time in the womb and the
<BR>
environment there *may* contain some interesting developmental history.
<BR>
The quantity of unique information that would eventually be &quot;important&quot;
<BR>
in the developmental path of the future individual is probably fairly
<BR>
small relative to the genomic information.  [In those cases where
<BR>
the developmental process is significantly impacted (i.e. there is
<BR>
an increase in information content due to divergence from the natural
<BR>
developmental program), the consequences are generally negative
<BR>
(e.g. thalidomide babies).]
<BR>
<P>No, I do not believe this information specific approach would justify
<BR>
killing one of a pair of twins.  It simply may be used to *minimize* the
<BR>
loss of information involved with an abortion.  You could extend
<BR>
this argument, that I as an SI, might dissassemble you, Damien,
<BR>
carefully recording the position of all of the molecules so that I
<BR>
could later reassemble you (to speak at the 1000th anniversary party of
<BR>
the publication of The Spike).  There is no *loss* of Damien
<BR>
in this, there is only the loss of the free expression of Damien's
<BR>
conscious *will* for a period of time.  Since you may argue
<BR>
that a fetus doesn't have a &quot;conscious will&quot; this loss does not
<BR>
occur in the case of an abortion.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the other hand, the puzzle I proposed in LAST MORTAL GENERATION has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; never received an answer from god-botherers, to my knowledge. Squish two or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three early embryos together in vitro, and they form a single moasaic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; individual. [snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

Hmmm, I don't remember seeing this discussion in LMG.
<BR>
Could I have missed it or is it in an updated edition?
