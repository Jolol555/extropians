<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I just signed on to receive the message service so that I may find out more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the Extropian movement. It has been interesting. I have been somewhat 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concerned about the rampant elitism running through the postings. Something 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that seem quite out of keeping with  people who purport to be acting in the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; best interest of humanity. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've always thought that the word &quot;elitism&quot; is fairly ambiguous: Does it mean 
<BR>
that the object of the description is only intended for a small, 
<BR>
highly-qualified group, or is it used with the more negative connotation of 
<BR>
exclusiveness and therefore exclusion?  While I am very happy that many 
<BR>
transhumanist and extropian ideas are moving into the mainstream (once again 
<BR>
I refer to my editorial in Extropy Online magazine 
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.extropy.com/eo/editorial2.htm">http://www.extropy.com/eo/editorial2.htm</A>), in reality the ideals, values and 
<BR>
goals that define extropians are still not widely held.  
<BR>
<P>As I've written before, far from being finished, the work of the 
<BR>
Enlightenment is actually barely begun.  Most of the world lives in ignorance 
<BR>
of the scientific method and it's real fruits.  The core values of individual 
<BR>
liberty and tolerance that energized the Enlightenment have only barely begun 
<BR>
to be accepted in the political and cultural sphere and most of the human 
<BR>
race continues to firmly believe that their own group - ethnic, social, 
<BR>
religious, linguistic - should enjoy special legal privileges and cultural 
<BR>
hegemony.
<BR>
<P>When you look at the sway that superstition and intolerance still hold over 
<BR>
the world, you come to realize that only a tiny minority of the human species 
<BR>
has really passed through the cultural transformation of the humanist 
<BR>
Enlightenment.  Transhumanists - who take the values and goals of the 
<BR>
Enlightenment to their logical conclusions - are yet a further minority 
<BR>
within that minority.  Thus, one might well apply the term &quot;elite&quot; to us, in 
<BR>
the non-pejorative sense of the word.  But for its unhappy association with 
<BR>
violent revolutionary movements in general and Bolshevism in particular, the 
<BR>
word &quot;vanguard&quot; might be appropriate.
<BR>
<P>Like all cultural pioneering movements, transhumanism and extropianism can be 
<BR>
seen as a tender shoot, in need of both nurturing and protection.  Seen as a 
<BR>
minority within a minority, transhumanists might be best viewed as an 
<BR>
experimental memetic creation, barely ready to be tried outside the hot house 
<BR>
of its birth within the unique environment of late 20th century West Coast 
<BR>
technological optimism and post-countercultural social experimentation.  As 
<BR>
optimistic memetic gardeners, we need to be willing to make that trial, but 
<BR>
we should also be aware that this is a new creature, encountering a well 
<BR>
established ecology of ideas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even so, I have viewed this to be due to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excesses of some members as I have not heard anything similar from Max 
</EM><BR>
Moore. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; So, I was beginning to believe that it would be something worthwhile to be 
</EM><BR>
a 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; part of. However, when Greg Burch wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;I've decided that a more systematic approach to concern about sources of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opposition to our ideals and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;goals is necessary.  To this end, I've begun work on a website in which I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;will collect links to groups and resources that appear to present a 
</EM><BR>
current 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  &gt;or potential threat to the transhumanist agenda.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  This gave me pause to reconsider. This is the Vice President of the 
</EM><BR>
Extropy 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Institute whom I assume has leadership support for this announcement. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I hope my post yesterday made clear that my &quot;watch list&quot; isn't an official 
<BR>
Extropy Institute endeavor.  Rather, it is merely a personal project, 
<BR>
motivated by my own study of the history of ideas.  (When Bill Clinton plays 
<BR>
the saxophone, should we take it as an official government endorsement of 
<BR>
jazz?)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Eliezer Yudkowsky in quite correct in his response to Robert Owen's note 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we exist in a political environment. Of course. Any relationship 
</EM><BR>
between 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; people is in the broadest sense political, but this different. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, I consider the notion that transhumanism and extropianism are 
<BR>
somehow &quot;apolitical&quot; quite strange.  We are advocating that human beings can 
<BR>
and should have the right to re-write their genetic code, create synthetic 
<BR>
intelligences, employ technology to augment their mental power, lengthen 
<BR>
their life spans indefinitely and migrate from Earth.  Every one of these 
<BR>
agenda items implicates public policy and, in many countries runs counter to 
<BR>
some powerful legal prescription.  The fact is that there are more or less 
<BR>
well-established ideological and political groups who oppose all of these 
<BR>
things in principle and, once our goals become widespread, will oppose them 
<BR>
in the political process.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Even so, it is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unclear what the opposition is. 
</EM><BR>
<P>That you can make this statement indicates to me that studying the cultural 
<BR>
environment in which transhumanism and extropianism will grow is all the more 
<BR>
necessary.  My personal opinion is that the opposition will come from three 
<BR>
ideological &quot;zones&quot;: &quot;Naturism&quot;, fundamentalist religion and racism.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Already people are buying into the program in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many ways and values are changing. 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is true and is a very, very good thing.  But even a cursory study of 
<BR>
history reveals that cultural change is neither smooth nor monolithic.  It's 
<BR>
not as if people in Europe woke up one morning in the middle of the 15th 
<BR>
century and all realized that the &quot;Middle Ages&quot; were over and that the 
<BR>
Renaissance had begun.  Likewise with the coming of the Enlightenment 200 
<BR>
years later.  In fact, the progress of both of those eras took place 
<BR>
relatively slowly, and not without substantial opposition.  There were false 
<BR>
starts, reversals and wrong turns.  Only by coming to know the cultural 
<BR>
environment in which our ideas exist and the historical dynamic that has both 
<BR>
given rise to them and will create opposition to them can we have a hope of 
<BR>
ultimately prevailing in our goals.  I've said it before and I'll say it 
<BR>
again: There is no such thing as historical inevitability.  Belief in 
<BR>
historical inevitability is in fact superstition.  Clothing it in the garb of 
<BR>
science is the worst perversion of the insights gained in the Enlightenment.  
<BR>
The bloody legacy of the 20th century is in large part due to this error.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; All I can see is that some do not feel 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things are going fast enough. This is &quot;youth&quot; talking. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, at my age, I'm glad to be accused of youthful error :-)  Things are NOT 
<BR>
going fast enough in my opinion, at least in a few key areas.  One of the 
<BR>
insights we offer to the world is that in technological development lies the 
<BR>
hope for resolution of many of the problems we have inherited from earlier 
<BR>
times.  Only by developing a more sophisticated biological science can we 
<BR>
remediate the damage that has been done to this planet's biosphere.  Only by 
<BR>
developing tools for more rational living can we overcome the violent 
<BR>
prejudices we have inherited from our primate ancestors.  Only by augmenting 
<BR>
our own intelligence can we hope to solve the complex problems that the 
<BR>
development of technology itself has bequeathed to our age and to our 
<BR>
children.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Greg's posting stands 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out all the more because it is the thinking and tactics of agrarian and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industrial age plotters and revolutionaries, something the world is 
</EM><BR>
learning 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; to leave behind. I strongly suggest that members become aquatinted with the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; history of some of the leaders and participants of the political and social 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; movements of the last 200 years. It is most instructive.
</EM><BR>
<P>With respect, I suggest that you take a look at the annotated bibliography at 
<BR>
my web site.  In addition to the material you'll find identified there, the 
<BR>
shelves of books here in my study not documented at my site (reading dating 
<BR>
from the geological eras before my web site) include dozens of works about 
<BR>
revolutionary periods in history - the main subject of my own personal 
<BR>
education for the last 30 years.  You will find no more vehement opponent of 
<BR>
&quot;revolutionary&quot; politics than me: A study of such periods as the end of the 
<BR>
Roman Republic, the American and French Revolutions and the Bolshevik and 
<BR>
Chinese communist revolutions (the eras in which I can claim at least some 
<BR>
expertise) all teach that revolutionaries almost always do more harm than 
<BR>
good.
<BR>
<P>A belief that we have somehow completely transcended history has been an 
<BR>
error too common in the modern era   Yes, technological developments in each 
<BR>
period of human history have created unique new social dynamics and unique 
<BR>
new problems and issues.  But some characteristics of life in society are 
<BR>
constant, transcend even human history and are shared by our biological 
<BR>
ancestors.  One of these constants is that no new thing develops in isolation 
<BR>
or without a &quot;dialectical&quot; process of interaction - often in the form of 
<BR>
conflict - with structures and processes that already exist.  I agree with 
<BR>
you most deeply that we must study history to avoid the mistakes of the past. 
<BR>
&nbsp;This endeavor is perhaps most important for transhumanism, because our 
<BR>
values and goals DO have &quot;revolutionary&quot; potential.  It would be far too easy 
<BR>
to fall into the traps of &quot;revolutionary thought&quot;.  We must avoid that kind 
<BR>
of mentality at all costs, because at best it would consign us to the 
<BR>
cultural margins and, at worst it would make us into monsters.  Only with a 
<BR>
solid knowledge of history can we navigate between these two extremes.
