<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Regarding what one can morally do to a future segment on oneself, that is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trickier issue. You have to specify in what sense this future mind would be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;you&quot;. In the case you describe, with this mind having no memory of who the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; present self is, and no control over what decisions the other direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuations of your present self are making, it seems hard to see in what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sense this mind is you. In this case, it seems you have no more right to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; coerce this other mind than you would have to coerce a genetic clone of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself.
</EM><BR>
<P>In this scenario I assumed the future mind would be me minus the
<BR>
awareness of the experiences being simulation. I don't know if that
<BR>
really can be viewed as a different person than me, after all the
<BR>
difference is just a lack of knowledge. Do I have the right of putting
<BR>
myself through torture? Obviously yes. Do I have the right to
<BR>
temporarily erase my knolwedge of French Classicist drama and then
<BR>
subjecting myself to torture? Seems to be very much the same as
<BR>
before. What if I erase my knowledge of the torture being simulation
<BR>
and bounded in time and then subject myself to it? What is the
<BR>
difference here?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 		&gt;Maybe this kind of extreme experience cognitive engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is &gt;going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		&gt;to be a popular thing among the posthumans? A kind of dare,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;passage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 		&gt;rite/education or just entertainment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A silly right of passage that would be. Why not do something difficult but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pleasant instead? And if it is the education we are after, couldn't we get
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that information in a less painful way, say by downloading the memory of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pain, or just learning about pain in general. Presumably, you think that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pain might somehow &quot;ennoble&quot; us emotionally; - but why not find a way of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changing our emotional state into that &quot;noble&quot; state - of humility and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resignation or whatever - directly, rather than go through the inefficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and horrendous process of getting to that state through having long series
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of painful experiences. That would be lot more transhumanist in my book!
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps. Remember, this isn't my own idea, I was just repeating it
<BR>
from a friend (Andreas Svedin). But I think he has a point with his
<BR>
thought experiment, not just because it involves interesting ethical
<BR>
questions. Adding new knowledge to a mind isn't just a question of
<BR>
downloading it, it has to be integrated into the network of
<BR>
connections that forms our worldview, our personality, our selves
<BR>
(sorry, no clean RPM modules :-). Just adding memories isn't possible
<BR>
unless we adopt an extremely different mental architecture. This means
<BR>
that experiences, real or simulated, will be important to change us in
<BR>
desired directions. These experiences can involve not just traditional
<BR>
sensory information but also direct neural modifications, but they
<BR>
have to integrate new information into our networks.
<BR>
<P>The way we achieve the end state is not important, I agree completely
<BR>
with you in that respect. The methods we use can be more or less
<BR>
crude, and are limited by available resources and technology. Assuming
<BR>
this pain experience has a worthwhile result (which remains to be
<BR>
seen) different methods have to be judged by their efficiencies and
<BR>
perhaps personal aesthetics. I don't see any reason to call one method
<BR>
more transhuman than the other.
