<P>
<EM>&gt; I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm sick of seeing such basic and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grevious conceptual errors as the above being made.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It's identical to for instance, stating that chocolate is an organisation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans and machines mixing various compounds. This is of course ridiculous.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The organisation of humans etc.. BRING ABOUT the chocolate - but they ARE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NOT *IT* !!!!! DAMMIT!
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I think you're the only one who's quite this upset.  ;)
<BR>
<P>Seriously, though, that claim is definitely a misreading of Dennett's own
<BR>
argument, which is eliminitivist, not reductivist.  That is, he thinks
<BR>
that there ARE no qualia, not that qualia are &quot;really&quot; physical phenomena.
<BR>
<P>However, the reductivist and the eliminitivist arguments are really just
<BR>
two different rhetorical approaches to materialism.  If you agree that
<BR>
materialism is right and that therefore qualia can't be NON-physical, it's
<BR>
only a matter of definition/semantics whether you decide to call some
<BR>
physical phenomena qualia or whether you decide not to call anything
<BR>
qualia.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps the stronger point to be made here is that nobody's making a
<BR>
conceptual error.  The reductivist/eliminitivist/materialist argument
<BR>
usually begins by establishing that qualia can't be non-physical.
<BR>
Certainly, then, the eliminitivist isn't making a mistake: he takes it
<BR>
that qualia are, by definition, non-physical, and therefore, since nothing
<BR>
non-physical exists, no qualia exist.  But the reductivist isn't making a
<BR>
mistake either: she can argue that certain physical phenomena have enough
<BR>
properties in common with qualia that almost all of the sort of things
<BR>
that we say about qualia are also true of the chosen physical phenomena.
<BR>
If you believe that enough of these properties are shared, you might be
<BR>
convinced to say that the physical properties could inherit the name
<BR>
&quot;qualia,&quot; since its original definition is empty.
<BR>
<P>It all resolves around the inherent problem that there's no way (even in
<BR>
principle) to tell which of the following two claims are correct:
<BR>
<P>1)  Almost everything you say about X is wrong, but is true of Y; you must
<BR>
REALLY be talking about Y.
<BR>
2)  You're talking about X alright, but everything you say about it is
<BR>
wrong.
<BR>
<P>Example:  &quot;Of course I know what a horse is.  A horse is a rounded edible
<BR>
fruit, coming usually in either red or green.  Fresh ones make a crunch
<BR>
noise when you eat them.&quot;  Am I talking about horses or not?
<BR>
<P>Reductivism, then, just assumes 1 is right with regards to your claims
<BR>
about qualia.  You're not REALLY talking about the non-physical, she
<BR>
argues: you're REALLY talking about these physical phenomena.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is this blatantly obvious to anyone else?
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if you take it as a definition that you're right.  ;)
