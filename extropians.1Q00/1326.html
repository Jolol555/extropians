<P>
Dogs don't have much problem exhibiting sexual interests
<BR>
in front of anybody, but would drag food into the bushes.
<BR>
<P>One of my favorite dance places last year was in a basement of a gay
<BR>
bar.  Two of my women friends tried to dance topless - freedom and 
<BR>
spiritual openness, it was for them.  Nobody had much of a problem with it, except for the people less familiar with the group the usual problem
<BR>
of making believe they are not paying as much attention as they would
<BR>
love to pay if they didn't have to make believe they are not interested...
<BR>
But then the manager came down and said that this should be stopped,
<BR>
or they would have to close the whole thing.  At the same time, at the
<BR>
entrance upstairs the TV screens were showing hard-core gay pornos.
<BR>
Go figure...
<BR>
<P>I am not saying that taboos are unnatural.  Not that it's that relevant.
<BR>
Nature, restrictions, and good are largely mutually independent, IMO.
<BR>
<P>I am just saying that persecution of people in the absence of rational
<BR>
discussions of what restrictions are reasonable in what settings, and
<BR>
denial that any irrational repression takes place, is a crime against
<BR>
both freedom and reason.
<BR>
<P>And the more complex and diverse the society, the more harm and tension
<BR>
will follow from illogical repressions, and the harder it will be to
<BR>
untangle the psychological and social knots.
