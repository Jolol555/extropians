<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Until a reliable way exists of rendering harmless ALL the badguys
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (including the ones with badges), I'm content to let everybody have a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gun.  Yea, even unto the nutcases and the ex-cons; for the alternative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is to put my safety at the mercy of some bureaucrat.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The above comment says it all:  you are anti-safety, not pro-safety, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if you're in favor of granting criminals and the insane packing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privileges.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, that is rather the crux of the matter: if your use of the
<BR>
term &quot;anti-safety&quot; means &quot;opposed to the idea that people have a right
<BR>
to be safe&quot;, then yes, I'm there too.  No one has a right to be safe.
<BR>
Reality doesn't come with that feature.  What reality does give us,
<BR>
though, is the judgment, intelligence, and free will to take charge
<BR>
of our own lives and create our own future through their use.  People of
<BR>
vision and courage have used those gifts to give us technology: fire,
<BR>
agriculture, language, transportation, construction--and weapons.
<BR>
Short-sighted people try to control the misuse of those technologies by
<BR>
restricting their use with government.  What that generally accomplishes
<BR>
is to limit their good uses while ensuring that they will still get into
<BR>
the hands of criminals and the insane--especially those working for the
<BR>
government.
<BR>
<P>It's no wonder this is a hot-button issue among Extropians; we are
<BR>
the architects of the future and proponents of technology.  How do we
<BR>
expect to address the public's fears about its misuse when we still
<BR>
have so much fear and misunderstanding of centuries-old technology?
<BR>
<P>If it seems like we are beating a dead horse with this issue, it's
<BR>
because it is so central to our core values--to what it means to be
<BR>
an Extropian--that we can't simply gloss over it.  We need to decide
<BR>
how access to future technologies will be controlled, and the best
<BR>
way to do that is to examine how present ones are being controlled,
<BR>
and how well current methods work.
<BR>
