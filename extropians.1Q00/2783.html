(John, to keep the other John in his chair you may want to snip more unless 
<BR>
its fairly old and people may not have the thread in their inbox.)

<P>I did read with interest what John Clarke said.  I found his remark 
<BR>
interesting that if a person had focused thoughts they did not need to cut 
<BR>
and paste, that used to be my approach too.  I got the cut and paste habit 
<BR>
by being on this list! lol  I do go overboard with it, I admit.  I just want 
<BR>
to be sure people know what I am referring to in detail so there is no 
<BR>
misunderstanding.  I want to make it is easy for them in case they have 
<BR>
already deleted the post I am discussing.  Also, some posts are so 
<BR>
exceptional to me I want to hold them up.
<BR>
<P>I am trying to change.  My first impulse was to cut and paste Queenemuse's 
<BR>
entire Seussian riff but I caught myself and just copied the part most 
<BR>
appealling to me.  Again, it shocked me when I first got on the list and saw 
<BR>
all the cut and pasting.  In time I picked up the habit.  I'm glad we don't 
<BR>
all meet at a nearby restaurant everyday where there is drinking and smoking 
<BR>
for hours!  You folks are a terrible influence on me. :)
<BR>
