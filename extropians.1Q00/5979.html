<EM>&gt;  Since you recognized it as sarcasm, you understand completely--you're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  just too stubborn to admit it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  
</EM><BR>
<P>That hurts my feelings, but then I suppose you may have intended to cause me 
<BR>
minor ego pain...
<BR>
<P>No, I did not know what he meant. I had never heard of that &quot;law&quot; against 
<BR>
contradiction. In fact I still don't really know what he was saying since he 
<BR>
said he couldn't really put it into words if I didn't already believe it, but 
<BR>
I SHOULD.
<BR>
<P>Confused the heck out of me, to tell you the truth, Lee.
<BR>
<P>On the Internet, sarcasm does not really work, since it relies heavily on 
<BR>
tone of voice and facial expression to get the desired result. Which should, 
<BR>
if properly used, include humor. This lacked humor, as far as I could tell, 
<BR>
but had some obscure meaning. Perhaps he was striving to enlighten me about 
<BR>
his way of seeing things!
<BR>
<P>In social situations sarcasm (when presented as a comeback) makes me laugh, 
<BR>
followed by an instant spontaneous response of &quot;...why the sarcasm?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Which opens up conversations?
