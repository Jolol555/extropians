<EM>&gt; So - how about the Revolution Foundation?  A well-funded group develops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both a business plan - and an invasion plan - for a target country.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ineffective leadership is forced out in one way or another.  The group
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comes in with sufficient resources (mostly trained staff, this isn't to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be another throw-money-away venture) to build up needed institutions -
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; courts, schools, etc.  Our favorite sort of minimal-interference,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; market-respecting government is instituted.  It doesn't have to be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; democratic, day one likely it can't be.  &gt;Now&lt; buy the land. Sit

Point of order: it's been done.
<BR>
<P>The company in question went into a number of states, between 1950 and
<BR>
1980, installed a new government and set up economic policies according
<BR>
to their own idea of how things should be run.
<BR>
<P>The results included, of course, the Iranian revolution of 1979. How 
<BR>
do you think Reza Pahlavi came to power in the first place?
<BR>
<P>(This leaves aside all the other instances where such intervention wasn't
<BR>
as spectacularly disastrous, but nevertheless left behind a legacy of
<BR>
unmarked mass graves and political turmoil.)
<BR>
<P>Clue: if you do this with government backing, it's called covert ops
<BR>
and has a _very_ bad smell these days because it tends to backfire
<BR>
a generation down the line. When the children of the dissidents
<BR>
your revolutionaries &quot;disappeared&quot; grow up, for example. Or when the
<BR>
economic/educational improvements filter through enough for the locals
<BR>
to realise fully just how they've been shafted. Or when your heavy-handed
<BR>
attempts to retain control loosen up just enough to permit a popular
<BR>
uprising.
<BR>
<P>And that's being optimistic -- it assumes that all your reforms work
<BR>
precisely as advertised, and the initial seizure was successful. If
<BR>
there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that nobody has a handle on The
<BR>
Truth. If your scheme works, it merely leaves you running a developed
<BR>
country full of people who hate you because you shot their parents'
<BR>
leaders. If it fails ...
<BR>
<P>Have you considered a career in the State Department or the CIA?
