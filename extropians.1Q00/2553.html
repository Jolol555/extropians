<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That's for sure :)

<P>Hmmmm... this raises a whole host of confusing issues.
<BR>
<P>As Ken pointed out, we now have cases where our email
<BR>
agents are &quot;hiding&quot; things from our attention because
<BR>
they look like things we think are irrelevant (gosh
<BR>
isn't that what the brain does much of the time???)
<BR>
<P>Then as Sasha pointed out, we should have some strength
<BR>
vis-a-vis our convictions.
<BR>
<P>But as Eliezer/Neal/Ziana observe, it isn't our convictions
<BR>
that are so much the problem but the convictions of the
<BR>
non-extropian overlords of list subscribers who may not be
<BR>
especially happy with the topics we so freely throw around.
<BR>
<P>One sees in the [distant?] horizon a lawsuit from parents
<BR>
against members of the Extropian list for contributing to
<BR>
the suicide of a list subscriber who became excessively
<BR>
depressed upon encountering discussions of Damien's &quot;Spike&quot; and
<BR>
Hanson's &quot;There Shall Be Only One&quot; uploading economics and
<BR>
Bradbury's proposed deactivation of obsolete sub-SIs (e.g. humans).
<BR>
<P>As recent discussions regading DeCSS (see Slashdot.org and
<BR>
pointers from it to Linux World) indicate, though their
<BR>
may be no merit to these legal actions, the net effect
<BR>
would be stifle free speech (and force conformance)
<BR>
among the list subscribers.  We only have to consider
<BR>
the can-of-worms that Keith Henson is in for evidence
<BR>
of this situation.
<BR>
<P>Should we start an Extropian Legal Defense Fund now?
<BR>
<P>Related to this, most humans are easily fooled by
<BR>
relatively primitive encryption...  Should we develop
<BR>
simple programs that would allow the list-server to
<BR>
transmit &quot;temperature adjective of physical act between
<BR>
two individuals&quot; for subsequent translation on the
<BR>
reader's machine only when the magic key sequence
<BR>
is entered?
<BR>
<P>The problem with being &quot;rationally conscious&quot; is that sometimes
<BR>
we must use that capacity to avoid the consequences that might
<BR>
be generated by the &quot;irrational&quot; or &quot;unconscious&quot;.
<BR>
