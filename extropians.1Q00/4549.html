<EM>&gt; I'm very far behind in my correspondence and I know that Robin has said he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has to drop out of this discussion for work reasons.  I've had time to
</EM><BR>
only
<BR>
<EM>&gt; read this interesting thread quickly and so make only this one comment
</EM><BR>
from
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the peanut gallery: I don't see Robin's points addressing the fundamental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;is-ought&quot; gap that I think Dan is talking about.
</EM><BR>
<P>We could discuss Rand's way of bridging the gap, i.e., by looking for what
<BR>
facts gives rise to values.  After all, it would appear only certain kinds
<BR>
of beings have or pursue values and only under certain circumstances.  That
<BR>
might be better than wondering what someone could possibly believe, etc.  (I
<BR>
haven't followed this discussion too closely either.  Hard to do with so
<BR>
many competing things on and off the list.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To me, it's one thing (and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a very important and good thing) to come up with increasingly accurate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; descriptive and predictive models of behavior,
</EM><BR>
<P>It would also be nice to see actual models of human behavior that are highly
<BR>
predictive, especially ones that can not only predict, say, habits or
<BR>
genetic stuff, but what the effects of a given change will be.  Granted, to
<BR>
some extent we all have this.  We interact with other people and expect
<BR>
certain ranges of reactions from them.  We even expect certain norms in film
<BR>
and fiction.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and quite another to develop
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PRESCRIPTIVE systems of analysis.  As I've written here before, I do not
</EM><BR>
see
<BR>
<EM>&gt; any fundamental inconsistency between scientific materialism and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;determinism&quot; on the one hand and the notion that sentient beings are
</EM><BR>
moral
<BR>
<EM>&gt; actors capable of making (and required to make) moral choices.  In brutal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; summary, my reconciliation of these two notions derives from complexity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory: above a certain level of complexity, mental systems cannot be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accurately enough modeled in practical terms to completely predict their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behavior, requiring such systems to employ generalizing heuristics that
</EM><BR>
map
<BR>
<EM>&gt; satisfactorily onto a traditional notion of the realm of &quot;ethics&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are a few problems here.  One, I question whether materialism is or
<BR>
can be scientific.  Science is typically taken to be a method of gaining
<BR>
knowledge or knowledge gained via that method.  Materialism is an
<BR>
ontological position.  I'm not claiming the twain never doth meet, just that
<BR>
one does not imply the other.
<BR>
<P>Two, the problem for morality of determinism is not about prediction per se,
<BR>
but about responsibility and choice.  To wit, if an alleged actor cannot
<BR>
choose any of her actions, then the typical -- and, to me, correct -- view
<BR>
is that she's not responsible for her actions.  In other words, we can't
<BR>
praise or blame her for doing right or wrong, good or ill, this or that.
<BR>
But that does not exhaust morality either.  After all, intentions as well as
<BR>
actions and results have to come into play.
<BR>
<P>Three, the complexity argument doesn't resolve the issue the way Greg wants
<BR>
it to be resolved -- with all sides being right and everything taken up into
<BR>
to some greater whole.  Instead, if a system is deterministic, it is
<BR>
deterministic, whether to itself it cannot be modeled or not.  (I would also
<BR>
submit that when we model our and other people's actions, we need not be
<BR>
complete or total -- any more than in trying to predict where to point the
<BR>
cameras on the Galileo probe presumes a complete knowledge of celestial
<BR>
happenings.  But that's what Greg meant by &quot;generalizing heuristics,&quot;
<BR>
right?:)
<BR>
<P>That a system is complex does not clear up everything either.  After all,
<BR>
paradigmatic complex systems tend to magnify small pertubations.  That being
<BR>
so, imagine a determined determinist who despite his scrutiny overlooks one
<BR>
small disturbance that happens to be completely undetermined.  Soon, that
<BR>
disturbance might affect the whole system.  What I'm saying is that
<BR>
complexity should make us a little humble -- though we should not retreat
<BR>
before it like some savage before a graven idol.:)
<BR>
<P>Too tired to write more!
