<EM>&gt; You are automatically assuming that the original works of the artist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were a clear perspective.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would not assume so, though, by the same token, I'd rather not have the
<BR>
government deciding these things, especially since its interests might never
<BR>
be in line with a clear perspective.  Witness last years campaign against
<BR>
Serbia by the US government.  Didn't the State Department do its best to
<BR>
paint the Serbs as bloodthirsty demons and the Albanians as helpless
<BR>
victims?
<BR>
<P>But aside from this example, one might claim, well, there are people who
<BR>
slant things in other ways, so why is the government doing so worse than any
<BR>
others?  First, the government is, sadly, assumed by many to be the correct
<BR>
point of view in anything.  This means the government line is taken to be
<BR>
correct.  You know how people trust the FDA to regulate drugs and the like?
<BR>
So, government is not an equal player here.  When a company slants
<BR>
something, generally, most people are suspicious if not cynical.  With
<BR>
government, this is not so.
<BR>
<P>Second, government is not equal in other ways.  Since it makes and enforces
<BR>
laws, it cannot be equated to others players in the information market.  It
<BR>
has an interest in staying in that position of rule making and rule
<BR>
enforcement -- one in making itself appear to be doing a great job or the
<BR>
best possible job and to also appear as a knight in shining armor when any
<BR>
problems do arise.  (On the latter, note how Hillary Clinton recently headed
<BR>
up the government campaign against giving Ritalin and Prozac to kids.  This
<BR>
is the same government who approved it for such uses!  There was no talk
<BR>
along the lines of, &quot;Oops, we made a mistake.&quot;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Orwell never spent any time in a communist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nation, he only knew what he heard by hanging out with the Cambridge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bred aristo-communists popular in Britain in the 30's.  Ask Sasha
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chislenko what he thinks...
</EM><BR>
<P>Orwell also spent some time in Spain during the Spanish Civil War
<BR>
(1936-1939).  He even joined a militia there.  He did get to see how
<BR>
Communists, especially Stalinists, operate up close and personal.  In fact,
<BR>
he wrote a book on it, _Homage to Catalonia_ in 1938.  This is a far cry
<BR>
from just hanging out in Cambridge.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
