The idea of transfecting animal cells with vectors causing switched
<BR>
expression of antifreeze proteins in situ is not exactly new (have a
<BR>
gander at <A HREF="http://cryonet.org">http://cryonet.org</A> ), and of course greatly preferable to
<BR>
using bacteria (there are bacteria which can exist within animal
<BR>
cells, but not too many, and they will be definitely hard to control).

2) Immunoreaction can be supressed (and, with a typical patient, is

<BR>
<P>We're talking about the end of your biological life span, something
<BR>
taking few days or weeks at best. The problem is having a quantitative
<BR>
tranfection vector targeting neural tissue without destroying
<BR>
it. Doing it before (say, at birth) is very risky since gene
<BR>
insertions are never quantitative and not as targeted as we would wish
<BR>
(I don't think a walking bag of carcinomas is a tolerable side effect).
<BR>
<P>Of course it should be possible to do vertical gene engineering

(antifreeze expression as heritable trait).
<BR>
<P>But why bother? It doesn't help the living, and those born when we

have the skills won't need the technology anyway.

<EM> &gt; but you will have to suppress that arm of the immune system on cryonic

<EM> &gt; reanimation until you purge those proteins.  In Greg's approach, you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; either have to suppress that arm of the immune system entirely (not good
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; from the perspective of cancer &amp; viral disease prevention) or find a way

<EM> &gt; to train the immune system to tolerate any &quot;new&quot; proteins.  Not impossible,

<EM> &gt; but at the edge of current science.
