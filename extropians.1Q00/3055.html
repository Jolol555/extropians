<P>There's also a temperature problem with living on mars. Maybe people filled
<BR>
with early generation nanotech to adjust for chemical problems with Martian
<BR>
atmosphere might also stay warm from the additional heat output of the
<BR>
little critters.
<BR>
<P>This thread brings to mind the question of people living in a gravity well.
<BR>
Not my cup of tea particularly, but then I'd like to be built into a little
<BR>
starfighter and zoom around fighting aliens, which is just soooo derivative
<BR>
and unimaginative.
<BR>
<P>Roberts scenario (chop up the planets and make post-singularity stuff)
<BR>
appears quite solid to me; there does seem to be a good argument that
<BR>
nanotech will come before Mars colonies, either because Mars colonies
<BR>
require nanotech, or because nanotech is easier and will come together more
<BR>
quickly.
<BR>
<P>People are people, however; not all of us will manage transhumanity
<BR>
immediately. This means you need something familiar, to cushion the impact,
<BR>
even when coming up with really funky solutions to problems like
<BR>
overpopulation. Mars colony, while useful for redundancy (backing up
<BR>
humanity) in the face of an uncertain nanotech future, doesn't seem viable
<BR>
for easing over-population; it is more likely to be settled by a seed
<BR>
population (not helping earth overpopulation at all), which would then
<BR>
develop on its own.
<BR>
<P>Given nanotech, maybe we could just shrink everyone? Dissassemble, then
<BR>
reassemble them really little (with attendant changes to anatomy - left as
<BR>
an exercise for the reader). We could shrink all the biolife, just
<BR>
reassemble it on a much smaller scale. Then hey-presto, we've got lots more
<BR>
living space, and we minimize the impact on the confused and bewildered
<BR>
(most everyone).
<BR>
<P>No-one mention uploading. How many suburbanites can you fit on the head of a
<BR>
pin?
<BR>
<P>More on my recent reading: Stats from '96 said 90% of Americans believe in
<BR>
God. Whatever. But the same surveys revealed that 70% believe in the Devil.
<BR>
That's a worry.
