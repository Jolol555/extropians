<P>Using a comment by Robert as a departure onto a new thread,
<BR>
I wish to ask a question I and my friends have been pondering
<BR>
for some time:  How do we teach children born in the 90s values
<BR>
appropriate to their times?
<BR>
<P>Background:  my regular social group consists of 4 couples:
<BR>
6 engineers, 1 computer scientist, 1 CPA.  We all went to
<BR>
college together.  Two couples have one child, I have none,
<BR>
4 kids total.
<BR>
<P>All the adults grew up in times where money was not plentiful.
<BR>
Now, money *is* plentiful, at least for those who invested
<BR>
aggressively (I didnt  {8-[  dammit.).  We were all taught to
<BR>
work hard, save money in the bank, buy the biggest house
<BR>
you can possibly afford because inflation will come along and
<BR>
make you a hero, etc.  These advises turned out to be...
<BR>
well, you decide.  Inappropriate for our times.
<BR>
<P>My grandfather told me the two very most important skills for
<BR>
any young man to have are: auto mechanics and self defense.
<BR>
OK.  One has been marginally useful, mostly as a hobby,
<BR>
the other totally useless.  Grandpa never saw a computer,
<BR>
so I would not expect him to understand the usefulness of
<BR>
learning to use one, however:
<BR>
<P>How can we avoid passing on similarly inappropriate values
<BR>
to the next generation?
