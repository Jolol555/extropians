<P>Well, they all _have_ to come down eventually. But with six
<BR>
independent engines (rotary type, redundant airborne capacity), the
<BR>
parachute emergency and large extent of automation these things are
<BR>
probably safer than a helicopter, or even a small private airplane. In 
<BR>
this case I would use them, if given the opportunity.
<BR>
<P>What is still missing is swarm collision avoidance. With digital pulse
<BR>
radio (plus 3..6-axis MEMS accelerometry and GPS) one could do very
<BR>
accurate realtime mutual measurements in a swarm of airborne machines,
<BR>
and feed that into the thrust vector/trajectory predictor to compute
<BR>
the optimal trajectory (the one which doesn't end in a small crater/in
<BR>
other skycars). Also there is SAR and lidar, to find where the ground
<BR>
is. 
<BR>
<P>In theory, the system could be very safe. In practice, it will depend
<BR>
on implementation/legislation. Primarily legislation.
