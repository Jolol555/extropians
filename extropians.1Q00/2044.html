From: Technotranscendence 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Though your proposal has merit, the police forces in the US 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; internal affairs divisions which are supposed to do just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Unfortunately Internal Affairs divisions ultimately report to the Chief of
<BR>
Police.  Here in Seattle there's been a long standing effort to have a wholy
<BR>
autonomous entity created to review citizen complaints against police.
<BR>
Citizens are frustrated precisely because the police Internal Affairs
<BR>
division is not responsive and does not seem to follow up cases of abuse
<BR>
with sufficient vigor.  Unfortunately the police department and mayor have
<BR>
continually refused to create such an entity.
