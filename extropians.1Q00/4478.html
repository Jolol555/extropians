<P>Ahem: Big Brother is being installed right now, as I type, in
<BR>
this very country -- the UK. Want a legislative framework? See
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.stand.org.uk/">http://www.stand.org.uk/</A> for the full gory details. Want cameras on
<BR>
every streetcorner? The British government is installing something like
<BR>
a thousand public CCTV cameras *a week*, while in many high streets it's
<BR>
impossible to get planning permission to open a shop unless you agree to
<BR>
install CCTV surveillance (and make it available to the cops, of course).
<BR>
<P>Meanwhile, we have a legislative stampede to ban evil -- on the grounds
<BR>
that Something Must Be Done, and the way to do it is to Pass A Law.
<BR>
The intersection of an over-legislated society with omnipresent
<BR>
surveillance is not a pretty prospect -- imagine the methods of the War
<BR>
On Drugs extended to cover equally jaywalking, illicit parking in disabled
<BR>
parking spaces, tax evasion, wilfully uttering obscenities in public, bank
<BR>
robbery, allowing a dog to foul the sidewalk, rape, and sexual harassment
<BR>
(eyeballing an attractive member of the appropriate sex while in public).
<BR>
<P>We have the technology, and we have the excuses. Be afraid: be very afraid.
