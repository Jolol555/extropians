<EM> &gt;I have reproduced his two posts here to share with you all the thoughts of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;this man.  I could have recommended going to the archive but then many might
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;not get around to read his words.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm on Cryonet.  I'll respond on this list but will deal with his plight
<BR>
separately.
<BR>
<P>We are each held prisoners of our bodies.  Some of us have more
<BR>
difficulties than others, but each of us has to deal with aches and pains
<BR>
and the threat of disease and death.  I do not know anyone who does not
<BR>
have some sort of physical ailment or disability and has to deal with it on
<BR>
a daily basis in some manner and to some degree.
<BR>
<P>His cry for help saddens me greatly - as my father's cry for help when he
<BR>
was dying which I can still hear.  I can feel my own terrible deep sadness
<BR>
at the possibility of  loosing any of my dear friends to disease and my own
<BR>
anguish at why the hell we have to put up with this horrible crippling
<BR>
dilemma!
<BR>
<P>Disease holds us captive while our spirits want to fly free.  No one should
<BR>
have to suffer so.
