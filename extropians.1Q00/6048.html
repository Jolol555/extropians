<EM>&gt; Do we really have a civil right to privacy?

<P>Our rights against search and seizure, self-incrimination, etc. are

based on it, and in any event, any rights not specifically enumerated
<BR>
are retained by the people as per the 9th amendment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I know we have always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assumed that we do, but suppose I have one of those cool airplane
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; thingies with the 18 gram camera in it, 15 cm wingspan, 75 gram
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; total.  I fly it over your house and for some reason I like to gawk
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at you.  Have I actually broken any laws?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since aerial photography is a licensed activity regulated by the FAA,
<BR>
they must recognise some limits, and the fact that its illegal to fly
<BR>
any airplane in many areas less than a given altitude above the ground
<BR>
indicates that there is some presumed minimum airspace that belongs to
<BR>
the property owner. Observing with the naked eye is legal. Using tools
<BR>
to spy on other people's property is not.

<EM>&gt; Dont worry Mike, I dont want to spy on you.  {8-]  spike

<P>I'm sure you don't, I have good anti-air defenses for flying things 15
<BR>
cm in size. My 20 guage shotgun that is perfect for woodcock, with #9
<BR>
shot, would take our your little spy plane at anything less than 50
<BR>
yards, and with magnum loads I could make shots of around 75-100 yards
<BR>
altitude. Anything higher and I'd have to bring out the goose gun.... 10
<BR>
guage #6 magnum loads....    Happy flying....
