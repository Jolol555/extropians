<HR NOSHADE><P>
<!-- body="start" -->
<P>
I've seen some comments that some (many?) extropians in spite
<BR>
of an awareness of Cryonics, don't believe it can work.
<BR>
<P>What I want to know is are there people who have read Ralph's
<BR>
technical essay:
<BR>
&nbsp;The Molecular Repair of the Brain
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html">http://www.merkle.com/cryo/techFeas.html</A>
<BR>
and who *still* believe cryonics is infeasible?
<BR>
<P>By infeasible, I mean do you have concrete reasons to believe
<BR>
that something Ralph says is in gross error or missing in the
<BR>
details of how one would molecularly reassemble the damage caused by
<BR>
freezing?  Another way of asking the same question is -- How
<BR>
can you believe that trillions of nanobots with collective
<BR>
ultra-human intelligence could *not* reassemble the 3D jig-saw
<BR>
puzzle left by your frozen brain?
<BR>
<P>The only thing I know to be somewhat questionable is the quoted
<BR>
lifetimes for DNA (hundreds of thousands of years).  Robert Freitas
<BR>
has worked this out in more detail and the times are shorter but
<BR>
the high redundancy in the body (and Celera's &quot;proof in reality&quot;
<BR>
of disassembled human genome reassembly) provide ample reason to
<BR>
believe we can reassemble functional genomes.
<BR>
<P>Now, perhaps people read Ralph's paper and said, &quot;Well thats all
<BR>
fine and good, but we don't have nanobots&quot;.  While we still don't
<BR>
have nanobots, we *do* have Nanomedicine and it seems to document to
<BR>
a large degree the capabilities required by Nanobots in Ralph's paper.
<BR>
One of the future Nanomedicine volumes, should have a chapter or
<BR>
so devoted to cryonics related issues.
<BR>
<P>Now, if you believe it is feasible, but are not signed up, then you
<BR>
are simply playing Russian roulette (which is fine IMO, just consider
<BR>
leaving your frozen head to me, so I can harvest meme-sets from it).
<BR>
But if you don't believe it will work, given the analysis that
<BR>
are thus far available, it seems you have some internal demons
<BR>
to wrestle with.  You can't simply say you want &quot;proof&quot; that
<BR>
it *will* work, you have to *assert* that it can never work.
<BR>
<P>Hekimi (discover of the clock genes) once observed to me --
<BR>
&quot;Anything man can conceive, he will eventually do.&quot;  I believe that
<BR>
is correct unless there are overwhelming reasons not to do it
<BR>
(I can't see that being the case with cryonic reanimation).
<BR>
So the only logical positions are to (a) claim it is infeasible and
<BR>
provide justification for that claim; or (b) allow that it is feasible,
<BR>
and will likely work at least for some people.  In the (b) camp,
<BR>
you have to justify why you are playing Russian roulette.
<BR>
<P>The position of &quot;believing it will not work&quot; *and* not having any
<BR>
good reasons for that seems pretty indefensible to me.  I'll take
<BR>
on any 3 people with that position at the next Extro conference.
<BR>
<P>Robert
<BR>
<P>Addendum.  In re-reading this note, it occurs to me that a great
<BR>
future-venture startup would be a company that offers to pay
<BR>
cryonics non-believers now for rights to their brain meme-sets after 
<BR>
death. A company that got financing for this would really *force*
<BR>
the issue into the public light.  I'm offering you $5000 for
<BR>
the right to take your brain (after death), freeze it and
<BR>
subsequently dismantle it for meme-experiences.  Think
<BR>
of the bidding wars you could get into for people with
<BR>
&quot;novel&quot; experiences.
