There's a chain of individuals: each fooled into believing he's all the 
<BR>
one's who've passed before him.  This is what I mean when I say 
<BR>
'consciousness' is instantaneous.  You're a sequence of instances, still 
<BR>
frames, with the happenstance of memory the only connection between them. 
<BR>
This is why death doesn't matter - you've already died an infinite number of 
<BR>
times.  You're being uploaded a trillion times a second.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I do see how in a sense the person I was especially ten or fifteen years ago 
<BR>
is mostly dead.  The natural processes of human development cause &quot;death and 
<BR>
rebirth&quot; even within the lifecycle.
<BR>
<P>Still, the Star Trek transporter analogy, or the one regarding uploading, do 
<BR>
unnerve me.  I do not want a perfect copy of myself from a second ago.  I 
<BR>
want me!  Some would philosophically argue that it does not matter but for 
<BR>
ME it does.  I would want some sort of interdimensional conduit that would 
<BR>
whisk me to another location rather then a molecular pattern reconstruction.
<BR>
<P>As for uploading, I do not want merely a perfect softclone copy of myself 
<BR>
being made.  I want ME.  I suppose some sort of process where the matter in 
<BR>
my brain is converted to a pure energy form where it can still function as 
<BR>
my consciousness with no loss of self-integrity.
<BR>
<P>I will be one of those people who will wait a long time to be convinced that 
<BR>
uploading does more then kill and then perfectly reconstruct the individual.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
