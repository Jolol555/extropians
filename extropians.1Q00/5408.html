<P><EM>&gt; You are automatically assuming that the original works of the artist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were a clear perspective. Orwell never spent any time in a communist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nation, he only knew what he heard by hanging out with the Cambridge
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bred aristo-communists popular in Britain in the 30's.  Ask Sasha

<EM>&gt; Chislenko what he thinks...

<P>Without taking any stand on the politics of the case, I must say, Mike,
<BR>
that the phenomenon you describe can be hilarious. While a graduate
<BR>
student my favorite chess opponent had inherited enough money to have
<BR>
just about anything he wanted (except perpetual victory, of course)
<BR>
including a live-in femme fatale whom I considered the most beautiful
<BR>
woman in the world.  A propos of nothing, her name was &quot;Polly Parrot&quot;.
<BR>
Naturally I was in love with her.  &quot;It's just his MONEY&quot; I told myself
<BR>
over and over again.   Perhaps it was.
<BR>
<P>But my chess friend was a fanatical, card-carrying, belligerent and
<BR>
&quot;imperialistic&quot; COMMUNIST.  Being quite bright, he really *knew* his
<BR>
Marx, Engels, Smith, Weber, Lenin, Mao and so on.  He held forth
<BR>
in a &quot;Fair Play for Cuba&quot; type Forum on campus, and I nurtured in an
<BR>
equally expansionist way what I HAD to call &quot;The Nietzsche Study
<BR>
Group&quot; -- at the time I thought benevolent authoritarianism was a
<BR>
good thing, all in all, but of course considered myself an authority-
<BR>
in-residence.  We both got over all this, but both took a lot of abuse
<BR>
and ridicule for our noble causes.
<BR>
<P>I personally find John le Carre' and his world of George Smiley the
<BR>
most vivid way of learning about the &quot;Cambridge Communists&quot;.
