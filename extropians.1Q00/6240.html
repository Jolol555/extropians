<EM>&gt;and *I* never got a &quot;threshold of the adventure&quot; scene.

<P>For you the path seemed clear from the time you first read about the 
<BR>
singularity and realized how important it would be to you.  But didn't you 
<BR>
hear any exciting music playing in the background at the time?  With all 
<BR>
this advanced tech coming we should all get to have our own background 
<BR>
music.

After deliberation, he decides to seal his fate. He presses the &lt;Enter&gt; key 
<BR>
and watches the moving bar on his display track the progress of the upload.

The adventure begins...
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Eliezer could wind up in a T2 scenario where a hostile AI sends through time 
<BR>
killing machines of various sorts to finish him off before he can accomplish 
<BR>
his work and save our timeline.  Be very careful Eliezer!  Of course, the 
<BR>
freedom fighters of the future who are known today as the Foresight 
<BR>
Institute, would send forth a sophisticated fighting machine to protect him. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It would take on a close likeness to Buffy in appearance, so we would 
<BR>
think he just had a really cute girlfriend that always tagged around with 
<BR>
him and have no idea she/it could singlehandedly fight off the 82nd 
<BR>
Airborne.
<BR>
<P><P>best wishes,
