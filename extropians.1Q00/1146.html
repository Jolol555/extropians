<EM>&gt; &gt; If 50% or more of

<EM>&gt; &gt; natural conceptions end in abortion (according to one issue of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Science), then there would appear to be lots of faulty working sets.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm a little confused on terminology here, Robert. The above paragraph
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggests that you are indicating that natural abortions arise due to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incompatibility of the &quot;working set&quot; of genes that comprise the fetus. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might actually place more emphasis on the mother's fault tolerance as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;gestation machine&quot; in these cases.
</EM><BR>
<P>Presumably the mother's error checking code is much less &quot;accurate&quot;
<BR>
than that of the growing organism itself.  I think the fraction of
<BR>
the genome implicated in development is at least in the 20-30% range
<BR>
(i.e. if your mutation rate is high enough to result in a single
<BR>
&quot;significant&quot; mutation in any one of 20% of the genes the development
<BR>
process fails).  More genes are probably involved in development
<BR>
but the mutations don't stop development because there are redundant
<BR>
backup systems that can function in spite of the mutations. This is
<BR>
why many transgenic gene knockout animals are surprisingly (and annoyingly
<BR>
to the scientists) &quot;fine&quot; from a health perspective.
<BR>
<P>While there is clearly some &quot;fault tolerance&quot; mechanism that ages
<BR>
and leads to things like increases Down's Syndrome, I would doubt
<BR>
very much it is the primary mechanism.  It also may be acting
<BR>
*before* actual conception.  Presumably there is some failure
<BR>
rate in the production of sperm and eggs and a &quot;robust&quot; system
<BR>
would have some process for removing as many failures as possible.
<BR>
But biology as we understand it now doesn't seem to have very
<BR>
good mechanisms for allowing a potental parent to &quot;inspect&quot; the
<BR>
sperm or eggs for problems.
<BR>
<P>Whether spontaneous abortions are due more to (a) gene sets that
<BR>
&quot;lethal&quot; to themselves (due to double mutants in essential
<BR>
genes or gene incompatibility) or (b) essential developmental
<BR>
failures (due to stochastic errors) may be difficult to say at
<BR>
this time.  It would certainly require an extensive exploration
<BR>
of the literature to get a better understanding of the processes
<BR>
involved and their frequencies.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I commented on old adults having roughly the information base
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of young adults resulting in equivalent information valuations...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would disagree with your assessment that killing an old adult is about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the same as killing a young one, in terms of information loss. I agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that memories are probably gathered linearly, but the older adult has so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much more base information with which to form new thoughts. A silly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; example:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Young adult has items of information: A and B | Total info: A, B, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AB. Where AB is the set of relations between the two initial pieces.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Old adult has items of information: A, B, and C | Total info: A, B, C,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; AB, AC, BC, and ABC.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Now when each of these learns something new, D, then the older adult
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would seem to &quot;get&quot; much more out of that new piece of information, no?
</EM><BR>
<P>This would presumably be true.  My comments were primarily intended to
<BR>
contrast the relative difference in rates of information accumulation
<BR>
and relationship establishing in children vs. adults.  Children may
<BR>
be learning things like new words at the rate of 10/day, while adults
<BR>
may be learning them a a rate of 10/year (as a gross example).  Unless
<BR>
the elderly adults are in highly stimulatory environments, I expect
<BR>
the information accumulation to occur at a declining rate (because
<BR>
they know more of what is required to survive and/or have constrained
<BR>
their environment to match their survival knowledge base).
<BR>
<P>I suspect given the architecture of the brain, that it may be
<BR>
difficult to establish the complete set of relationships that you
<BR>
discuss.  There is probably some limit on the number of links
<BR>
a piece of information might have.  Just as in computers where
<BR>
files may be limited to 2^8 or 2^16 links, so to the brain has
<BR>
geometry constraints.  If you look at Calvin's hexagonal architecture,
<BR>
the limit might be 6 neighbors.  If you look at neuronal interconnects
<BR>
it might be a few thousand neighbors.  Since the &quot;strength&quot; of
<BR>
neural connections seems to be correlated with their survival
<BR>
significance and since in most &quot;elderly&quot; survival &quot;crisises&quot; are
<BR>
rare (relative to children or adolescents), I suspect their information
<BR>
relationship interconnect rates and strengths are lower.
<BR>
<P>Looking at the absolute information loss (due to death), I'd put the values
<BR>
at something like: Embryo: 1, Child: 100, Young Adult: 1000, Old Adult: 1100.
<BR>
Looking at the &quot;potential&quot; for information &quot;gain&quot; lost, its probably
<BR>
more like: Embryo: 10, Child: 1000, Young Adult: 200, Old Adult: 100.
<BR>
(The low value for the embryo being due to the high probability that
<BR>
it would not have made it to the &quot;child&quot; stage anyway.)
<BR>
<P>You can quibble with the numbers but the point is to consider the
<BR>
total information content or rate of information accumulation of
<BR>
an individual.  Our current legal/moral systems seem to only have
<BR>
two or three slipper sizes when we probably need dozens.
