<EM> &gt;were handwaving and/or naive. I'm happy to stick by some of what I wrote

<P>The stability and plausibility of a nano-gift economy seems to me to be
<BR>
much more questionable.  *If* such an economy made sense, I don't find
<BR>
it hard to imagine industry developing the technologies that make it possible.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;We need to pause here and take a breath. Who is supposed to be funding this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;leap into future technology, especially when its end result is a new kind
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;of productivity that bites the hand that feeds it? ...
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;To put the matter crudely: putting your nest egg into nanotechnology, it
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;might be said, would be like investing in a machine that could counterfeit
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;money, or turn lead into gold.
</EM><BR>
<P>Would industry develop a technology that cheaply turned lead into gold?
<BR>
You betcha!  Now you might have a closer case regarding a technology that
<BR>
cheaply turned oil into diamonds; DeBeer so dominates that industry, they
<BR>
might have a fighting chance of suppressing such a thing, buy say buying
<BR>
up related patents.  But when you're thinking of developing a box to
<BR>
replace most manufacturing, industry is so far from being dominated by a
<BR>
single power on that scale that it's no contest.  It would take at least
<BR>
as much state coordination as what the nuclear powers have used so far to
<BR>
discourage nuclear proliferation.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt;Barry Jones ... notes: permits an exponential rise in output together
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;with an exponential fall in total inputs--energy, labor, capital, space
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;and time. In economic history there is no remote equivalent to this...
</EM><BR>
<P>That is just completely wrong.  Standard economic growth *is* exactly
<BR>
such an exponential rise and fall.
