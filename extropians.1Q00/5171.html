<P><P>The End in Sight? Some Speculations on Environmental Trends in the
<BR>
Twenty-First Century
<BR>
Peter Harper, Futures 32 (2000) 361-384
<BR>
<P>The quarrel between the &quot;The Ecocalypse is Nigh&quot; school of pessimistic
<BR>
environmentalist and the &quot;Don't worry&quot; school of optimistic (mainly)
<BR>
economists have raged for quite some time. Both sides have gathered
<BR>
evidence for their positions, and even discounting different
<BR>
perceptual paradigms (you only see what you want to see) it is a bit
<BR>
strange that neutral outsiders cannot get a consensus pricture from
<BR>
this evidence. This paper suggests a fairly simple (simplistic?)
<BR>
explanation, namely that both sides have been looking at parts of the
<BR>
world but not the whole (as they claim). In the &quot;North&quot; there is a lot
<BR>
of evidence for environmental optimism, we have low population growth,
<BR>
industries getting cleaner per capita all the time, even a trend
<BR>
towards people settling at a comfortable living standard. In the
<BR>
&quot;South&quot; there is a lot of stuff going on that looks like the
<BR>
ecocalypse narrative. 
<BR>
<P>Harper plays around with a very simple model about what might happen
<BR>
during this century, and comes to the conclusion that the big problem
<BR>
isn't the North - it might be rich, but the environmental impact will
<BR>
be much less than the impact of the South. He argues that we see a
<BR>
kind of transition complex not unlike the demographic transition,
<BR>
where emerging economies go through a high pollution/resource
<BR>
depletion phase - it is likely the South will go through a this phase
<BR>
in the early part of this century, and then go down towards a less
<BR>
polluting, high affluence level. It is useless to try to stop this
<BR>
from happening, but we can try to help the South make it as quickly
<BR>
and cleanly as possible. Harper suggests that this unique 'spike'
<BR>
should be embraced and managed rather than avoided or delayed.
<BR>
<P>[ I'm not well read on environmental economics, so I cannot judge if
<BR>
this is a good paper or not. I liked it, it had a lot of good
<BR>
references and explained things clearly and persuasively, but I would
<BR>
certainly like if some more knowledgeable readers commented. ]
<BR>
<P><P><P>Evaluation of anti-cocaine antibodies and a cocaine vaccine in a rat
<BR>
self-administration model
<BR>
<P>Kathleen M. Kantak, Stephanie L. Collins, Elizabeth G. Lipman, Julian
<BR>
Bond, Kate Giovanoni and Barbara S. Fox Psychopharmacology (2000)
<BR>
148:251--262
<BR>
<P>It is possible to create monoclonal antibodies against nearly
<BR>
anything, so can antibodies be used to treat drug misuse? This paper
<BR>
tested the effects on rats, first in a passive task where the amount
<BR>
of cocaine and antibodies were varied, second in an active task where
<BR>
rats were immunized before being given the chance to return to cocaine
<BR>
self-administration. The results suggest that the antibodies can
<BR>
inhibit the reinforcing effects of cocaine and reduce cocaine-seeking
<BR>
behavior and drug intake in rats as long as the concentration is above
<BR>
0.05 mg/ml in the serum.
<BR>
<P>[ This approach is interesting. It has obvious applications for
<BR>
treating addiction, and some worrying possibilities for calls of
<BR>
mass-vaccinations. But it also has the implication that we may develop
<BR>
means of making overcoming addiction less of a problem, and that might
<BR>
be real dynamite in the drug debate. ]
<BR>
<P><P><P>Effects on Environmental Enrichment on Rate of Contextual Processing
<BR>
and Discriminative Ability in Adult Rats
<BR>
<P>Elizabeth A. Woodcock and Rick Richardson
<BR>
<P>Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 73, 1-10 (2000)
<BR>
<P>That it is good to grow up in an enriched environment is well
<BR>
established, but in what ways does it promote cognition? This study
<BR>
compared rats that had grown up in an enriched, interesting
<BR>
environment with rats from a boring environment. The rats were placed
<BR>
in a new environment, and after a while they got an electric shock. A
<BR>
while later they were placed in the same environment, and the amount
<BR>
of freezing they exhibited (a measure of how much they remembered the
<BR>
danger) was compared. It turned out that enriched rats learned faster,
<BR>
and when placed in a similar but different environment they had an
<BR>
easier time recognizing the difference. Apparently they processed
<BR>
context more rapidly and also could handle more complex situations. 
<BR>
<P>[ Yet another reason to bring up the children in an exciting environment. ]
<BR>
<P><P>Enhanced Visuospatial Memory Following Intracerebroventricular
<BR>
Administration of Nerve Growth Factor
<BR>
<P>Catherine Brandner, Guido Vantini and Francoise Schenk
<BR>
<P>Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 73, 49--67 (2000)
<BR>
<P>Rats were given injections of NGF when 12-13 days old. This
<BR>
considerably improved their memory abilities when tested 10-19 days
<BR>
and 6 months afterwards. The young rats actually did as well as adult
<BR>
rats in the first test. 
<BR>
<P>The authors speculate that this may have something to do with a better
<BR>
developed cholinergic system in the treated rat brains; this remains
<BR>
to be seen but I wouldn't be surprised. The nice thing for transhuman
<BR>
applications is that this treatment doesn't have to be done in
<BR>
association with learning as in the case of most other memory
<BR>
enhancing drugs, instead it improves the built in memory control
<BR>
systems. Also worth noting given the above two articles is that
<BR>
enriched environments have been shown to lead to higher levels of NGF
<BR>
in the brains of rats, possibly the reason they are so good.
<BR>
<P><P>Shuttle-Box Avoidance Learning in Mice: Improvement by Glucose
<BR>
Combined With Stimulant Drugs
<BR>
<P>Mario Sansone, Mario Battaglia and Flaminia Pavone
<BR>
<P>Neurobiology of Learning and Memory 73, 94-100 (2000)
<BR>
<P>Glucose and stimulants improve memory in general, but how do they
<BR>
interact? This paper tested combinations of glucose, nicotine and
<BR>
amphetamine on rats in a shuttle-box task. It turned out that by
<BR>
combining glucose with a stimulant memory could be enhanced even if
<BR>
the individual doses were alone too small to improve it. This is
<BR>
likely due to having two different systems for memory modulation,
<BR>
which multiply together. 
<BR>
<P><P>A Randomized Controlled Trial of Early Dietary Supply of Long-chain
<BR>
Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids and Mental Development in Term Infants
<BR>
<P>Eileen E. Birch, Sharon Garfield, Dennis R. Hoffman, Ricardo Uauy,
<BR>
David G. Birch
<BR>
<P>Developmental Medicine &amp; Child Neurology (2000) 42:174-181
<BR>
<P>The brain needs a lot of nutrients to develop, especially fatty acids
<BR>
to be incorporated into cell membranes etc. This study studied the
<BR>
effects of supplying docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and arachidonic acid
<BR>
(AA) to healthy children from day 5 to week 17 of age. When they were
<BR>
18 months old they were tested using infant development scales. The
<BR>
combination DHA+AA led to an increase in the mental development index
<BR>
(7 points of the MDI of the BSID-II) and both the DHA and DHA+AA
<BR>
groups had cognitive and motor advantages compared to the control
<BR>
children who had not got any supplements.
