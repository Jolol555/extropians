<EM>&gt; I walked past a woman in the metro tonight.  She had one young child
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; standing beside her and another infant in her arms.  The arm holding

<EM>&gt; &gt; the infants head ended in an outstretched palm.  At the end of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the passage was a seemingly talented flutist playing not sad, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not happy tunes.  I noticed a 10 ruble (~$.30) note in his flute case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Whom should I have helped -- both, neither?  I really don't know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; anymore.

<P>That is part of what I wanted to say to Robert in reply to
<BR>
the same post, Gina.  It is all, as you, suggest, full of para-
<BR>
dox and ambivalence.  But it is Robert's final sentence that
<BR>
for me was so full of pathos.  I really want to know why it
<BR>
is we don't know?
<BR>
<P>Thank you for bringing your resolution to my attention,
