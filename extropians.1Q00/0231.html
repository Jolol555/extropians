<P>
<EM>&gt; Something needs to be done, clearly.  But I'm not entirely sure if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there is a fatal problem in the structure of traditional debate.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; problem probably lies in the medium or in the channels by which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; debates may be productive...
</EM><BR>
<P>I proposed a debtate format here not long ago using the web to
<BR>
eliminate problems of time constraints and charisma effects and
<BR>
other problems, but there are still the problems that the proponents
<BR>
are identified and therefore it is not in their interest to seek
<BR>
truth where it interferes with ego, and moderator bias.  I do not
<BR>
believe that it is possible even in principle to eliminate
<BR>
moderator bias (I believe even the pretense of objectivity is just
<BR>
dishonesty), but it is possible to minimize the ego problem, since
<BR>
the identity of the arguers is irrelevant to the argument anyway.
<BR>
I don't believe you can do away with the moreator either if you
<BR>
want a result of any quality.  Human judgment, selection, editing,
<BR>
and focus are necessary to produce any useful communication.  The
<BR>
fact that such a communication will also be biased by the prejudices
<BR>
of the person exercising such judgment is simply a reality that
<BR>
must be understood.  Indeed, I think it is a major problem that we
<BR>
do not adequately educate or prepare people in our society to see
<BR>
and understand those prejudices; too many of us buy into the myths
<BR>
of objectivity and balance; it is a crime that students of journalism
<BR>
are taught to believe that there is a difference between news and
<BR>
commentary, for example.
