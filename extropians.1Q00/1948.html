<P>You might find the review of &quot;The Origins of Virtue&quot; by Matt Ridley, to be
<BR>
of some value. He also wrote &quot;The Red Queen, Sex and the Evolution of Human
<BR>
Nature.&quot;  The review is at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.scitec.auckland.ac.nz/~king/Preprints/book/socio/rq.htm">http://www.scitec.auckland.ac.nz/~king/Preprints/book/socio/rq.htm</A>
<BR>
Rather lengthy at thirty-six pages, nonetheless, it probably has something
<BR>
to both appease and rile every viewpoint. For example:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Geoffrey Miller returns to the sexual motif: &quot;I suggest that the neocortex
<BR>
is not primarily or exclusively a device for tool-making, bipedal walking,
<BR>
fire-using, warfare, hunting, gathering or avoiding savannah predators. None
<BR>
of these postulated functions alone can explain its explosive development in
<BR>
our lineage and not in any other closely-related species ... The neocortex
<BR>
is largely a courtship device to attract and retain sexual mates: its
<BR>
specific evolutionary function is to stimulate and entertain other people,
<BR>
and to assess the stimulation attempts of others. ... Just as the peahen is
<BR>
satisfied with nothing less than a visually-brilliant display of peacock
<BR>
plumage, I postulate that homonid males and females became satisfied with
<BR>
nothing less than psychologically brilliant, fascinating, articulate,
<BR>
entertaining companions&quot; - the cultural equivalent of runaway sexual
<BR>
selection - no one can afford to select for anything else and survive.
<BR>
Matt finishes off with a theory which would make Buss smile and displease
<BR>
Sarah Hrdy. He suggests that this vagrant male selection for young pretty
<BR>
women selects for neotony - delayed development that enables the human brain
<BR>
to grow much bigger before it stops growing in relation to the body.
<BR>
Christopher Badcock has countered with a comparable theory of female
<BR>
selection of younger men. An interesting point here is that the female is
<BR>
the more neotonous of the two sexes, so once again the female is one step
<BR>
ahead in evolution.&quot;
