Very like &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; during the expansionist, if not imperialist, 
<BR>
phase of American history. &quot;Nationalism&quot; can degenerate into a perverse form 
<BR>
of religious fanaticism.  This makes it sound like that phase is over. 
<BR>
America appears to be very imperialist of late... I gather it depends on how 
<BR>
one defines imperialism.  Surely, controlling other nations' internal 
<BR>
politics is one indicator. If so, then in the past ten years, America has 
<BR>
interfered in Somalia, Haiti, Bosnia, and Serbia. It's used military 
<BR>
intervention in all four cases mentioned. This is aside from the various and 
<BR>
often routine bombings of ther nations -- Iraq, the Sudan, Afghanistan.  
<BR>
Maybe there's some dividing line I'm missing here.

Seriously, what territories have you acquired lately that were worth the 
<BR>
effort. Sure, it's good politics to conquer Western Europe, write your 
<BR>
version of &quot;The Gallic Wars&quot;, cross the Rubicon and trip on a narcissistic 
<BR>
high at each &quot;Hail Spudboy&quot;.What's coming are the Huns, the Vandals, the 
<BR>
Goths and the Visigoths, and worst of all, the knife twisted by your 
<BR>
bestfriend. Is this not an adequate metaphor for &quot;The Wages of Imperialism&quot;?

<P>Robert, imperialism in the classic sense may be gone, but that is because 
<BR>
it's too expensive and make's for poor public relations!  We now live in the 
<BR>
age of neo-colonialism.  It is at least superficially a more acceptable 
<BR>
version of the old ways of doing things.  Conquered territories are occupied 
<BR>
now by our corporate powers that bind and control (and for some mutual 
<BR>
benefit) our third world neighbors.  We control them, and in turn their own 
<BR>
ruling elite bind the common people of their nation's to supply us with what 
<BR>
we want from them.
<BR>
<P>Our global corporate CEO's are the new conquering Ceasers who write their 
<BR>
version of the 'Gallic Wars' as business self-help manuals!  And they are 
<BR>
too hailed as great defenders of their respective way of life.
<BR>
<P>And the 'barbarian hordes' of our day would be India and China who want 
<BR>
desperately the technological and economic type of power we possess.  As the 
<BR>
ancient Romans did, we educate and employ them but they often return to 
<BR>
their own people to share our ways and secrets.  Just as Rome was partially 
<BR>
bested because of 'Roman-trained enemies'
<BR>
will we go the same way?  Where does the knife-twisting come from in our 
<BR>
age?  Our own government, ourselves?
<BR>
<P>I hope in time we can get beyond this thinking and nationalistic concern in 
<BR>
all camps concerned.  What will the 'wages of neo-colonialism' ultimately 
<BR>
be?
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
