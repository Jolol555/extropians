<EM>&gt; &gt; Yeah, but that's not realistic.  I'm trying to save the world and *I*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; never got a &quot;threshold of the adventure&quot; scene.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Our hero sits at the keyboard, the phosphors of his monitor showing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his young features in sharp contrast.  Having just completed his work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Coding a Transhuman AI&quot;, he contemplates for a long while the full
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consequences of posting the document on a public site for all to see--
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including those who might use the knowledge for evil ends.  But if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he doesn't publish, will those who _should_ use this knowledge ever
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; come in contact with it?  After deliberation, he decides to seal his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fate.  He presses the &lt;Enter&gt; key and watches the moving bar on his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; display track the progress of the upload.  The adventure begins...
</EM><BR>
<P>See, now that's just what I mean!  There isn't any of this great,
<BR>
dramatic indecision and hesitation.  The correct choice is usually an
<BR>
order of magnitude better than any alternative, and obviously so; I can
<BR>
recall only one or two major decisions in my life when this was not the
<BR>
case, and neither of them were transhumanism-related.  (And hey, if you
<BR>
make the wrong decision, you make the wrong decision.  Obsessing over it
<BR>
won't help.)  I read _Great Mambo Chicken_ when I was eleven, and I did
<BR>
not &quot;decide&quot; that my life would be about ultratechnology; I simply knew
<BR>
that it would be.
<BR>
<P>There was never a point, in all my life, where I could have plausibly
<BR>
refused the quest.
