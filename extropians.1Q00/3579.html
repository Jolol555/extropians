They have, as far as I have always shoped at bookstores, live together in 
<BR>
the same section.  Also the artists who illustrate the covers are in the 
<BR>
same pool of illustrators...Fantasy is lame isnt it?
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>No!!  Well-written fantasy is not lame!  It is wonderful and besides grandly 
<BR>
entertaining readers it can also give insights into the human condition just 
<BR>
as other works of great fiction can.
<BR>
<P>I understand the desire to stick with science fiction because the world is 
<BR>
moving in the direction of ever more advanced technology which will 
<BR>
transform our individual lives and cultures.  I tend to gravitate more 
<BR>
toward science fiction but occassionally I can find a good fantasy novel and 
<BR>
really enjoy myself.
<BR>
<P>I believe Terry Brooks(Sword of Shannara) said in an interview that when 
<BR>
times are good people go for science fiction but in harder times people tend 
<BR>
toward fantasy.  That made sense to me.
<BR>
<P>Actually, in the far future I could see well-written fantasy from our time 
<BR>
being more appealling to the inhabitants of that time because of it's 
<BR>
timeless nature.  We will see.  I think there is room for both genre's of 
<BR>
writing.  I do wish they were kept separate though!  I get a little 
<BR>
confused! lol
<BR>
