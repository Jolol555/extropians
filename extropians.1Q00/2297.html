sigh..
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yes, you can find a lot of advocacy groups making strong claims.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But quotes from these groups are not an adequate response to my directly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; citing evidence from the academic literature on this topic.
</EM><BR>
<P>cdc = Center for Disease Control = US National Center for Infectious
<BR>
Diseases
<BR>
who = World Health Organization
<BR>
vaccinealliance.org = GAVI...board = Bhutan govt, Zimbabwe govt, Canadian
<BR>
govt, World Bank, Rockefeller Foundation, US National Institute of Health,
<BR>
Ministry of Health, Welfare and Sports--Netherlands, Center for Vaccine
<BR>
Development at University of Maryland School of Medicine, United Nations'
<BR>
Children's Fund, Gates CVP=Bill&amp;Melinda Gates Children's Vaccine Program at
<BR>
PATH (Program for Appropriate Technology in Health)
<BR>
The line separating academia from business from govt from advocacy groups
<BR>
appears to have evolved to encompass and unify disparate communities towards
<BR>
achieving a common goal.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; On the effect of medicine overall in the US, I point you to:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Joseph P. Newhouse And The Insurance Experiment Group,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Free For All? Lessons from the RAND Health Insurance Experiment,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harvard University Press, 1993, ISBN 0-674-31914-1

<BR>
&quot;Climate forecasting can also be extremely useful in targeting scarce
<BR>
funding for surveillance and response, research and training, and emergency
<BR>
production of vaccines, drugs, and diagnostics, in the U.S. and abroad...&quot;
<BR>
in a publication by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
<BR>
<P>Hal commented:
<BR>
In the same way, we don't know what would have happened if vaccines and
<BR>
other medical technologies had never been developed.
<BR>
<P>Robin added:
<BR>
So when a time series of deaths from a certain illness doesn't seem
<BR>
to show a substantial effect due to the supposed breakthrough treatment
<BR>
for that illness, that seems to be evidence against medicine.  This
<BR>
lack of time series effect seems to apply for these diseases and
<BR>
treatments:
<BR>
<P>I was unfamiliar with the term &quot;time series effect.&quot; However the CDC covers
<BR>
this in Special Analytic Issues, under Aberrations in Time.
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov.epo/surveillancein/newpage21.htm">http://www.cdc.gov.epo/surveillancein/newpage21.htm</A>
<BR>
&quot;1. State health departments report the occurrence of approximately 50
<BR>
notifiable diseases weekly to CDC's National Notifiable Disease Surveillance
<BR>
System (NNDSS)...
<BR>
...4. CDC MMWR Current/Past Experience Graph
<BR>
a. compares the number of reported cases in current 4-week period for a
<BR>
given health event with historical data on the same condition from the
<BR>
preceding 5 years.&quot;
<BR>
<P>In light of the extensive recording mandated by the CDC, it is difficult to
<BR>
imagine that relevant time series effects are unavailable or nonexistent for
<BR>
the disease/vaccination pairings that you listed. Our in-house
<BR>
epidemiologist may be able to shed light on this...or perhaps a call to the
<BR>
State Lab?
<BR>
<P>Thank you for this discussion. The time-series and ARIMA models are
<BR>
applicable to another area that I have been studying with minimal progress.
<BR>
So.
