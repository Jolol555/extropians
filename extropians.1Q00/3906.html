I have in fact found that if I keep a running count, plus or minus, as cars 
<BR>
pass me and I pass them back, I do find that the actual progress of the 
<BR>
other line relative to my own is much less discouraging than my instincts 
<BR>
suggest. This has helped me stay calmer while driving.

<P>I was fascinated by the article you listed.  I have so many times seen 
<BR>
driver's who are convinced THEY are in the slow lane.  It would be nice to 
<BR>
get this information out to the public so that there might be a little less 
<BR>
crazy driving out there.  At least a few driver's would try out the 
<BR>
experiment you described to see which lane is fastest.
