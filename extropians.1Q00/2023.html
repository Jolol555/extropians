<EM>&gt; &gt; but in the meantime, what argument could I offer my humvee driving

<EM>&gt; &gt; neighbor as to why this is not a good thing?  spike

<P>That is one way to go with it.  Here's an ugly American approach:
<BR>
the Chinese are ready to go all internal combustion on us.  [Who
<BR>
can blame them?  We have certainly had our fun, have we not?]
<BR>
Furthermore, they have already announced that they do not intend
<BR>
to spend large sums on catalytic converters and other western
<BR>
pollution control technology, so their country may soon start to
<BR>
smell like... like cars did back in the 60s.  [Anyone here remember
<BR>
that smell?  The local ice cream truck sends one down memory
<BR>
lane with that peculiar odor.]  Since the prevailing winds carry
<BR>
pollutants across the Pacific, every good American must do
<BR>
his patriotic and ecologic duty to burn up that petrol clean before
<BR>
China can burn it dirty.  {8^D  spike
