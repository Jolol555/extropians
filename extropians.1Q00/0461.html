<P><P>An interesting correlation is that one of the areas of the United States
<BR>
with a very high Basque concentration is northern Nevada.  Many towns in
<BR>
northern Nevada identify very strongly with their Basque ancestry, and it
<BR>
permeates the local culture.  The correlation is interesting because the
<BR>
population of that area is well known to be strongly resistant to Federal
<BR>
interference and very confrontational when the Federal government tries to
<BR>
get involved in their local affairs, to the point of violence some times.
<BR>
<P>I would strongly agree that there is a cultural component to &quot;independent&quot;
<BR>
peoples.  However, it is interesting to note that many of these peoples
<BR>
also have a difficult time maintaining territory.  From my own
<BR>
experience, it seems that the extreme decentralization promoted by the
<BR>
culture also makes it more difficult to repel highly centralized
<BR>
aggressors.  On the other hand, the indomitable will of these peoples
<BR>
tends to be a force multiplier as well and the decentralization makes the
<BR>
populations impossible to control.
