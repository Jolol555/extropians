Hi!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;While I agree short lived species are &quot;behind&quot; us in terms of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evolving *solutions* to aging, aging itself is a fairly universal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;process (grey hair, reduced libido, organ failure, etc.) and so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;treatments or methods that work in short lived species would seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to be the first place to start in developing treatments for long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;lived species such as humans.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd say that the phenotype of aging in Drosophila, C. elegans and yeast
<BR>
(three of the most used models) is different than that in humans. I think
<BR>
it's likely (but not certain) that they age for different reasons than us.
<BR>
As for studying Parkinson, it's the same old story of trying to minimize the
<BR>
effects of aging instead of aiming at discovering what causes aging in the
<BR>
first place. The NIA's funding policy is hardly helping us reach the fourth
<BR>
millenium.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Relatively sudden death syndromes, such as you point out in male
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;marsupial mice, or the more common example of salmon, are probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;stress induced death, perhaps with some of the characteristics of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aging.  They would be less likely to be good models in which to test
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aging interventions.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not probably, certainly they are &quot;stress induced death&quot; (what I like to call
<BR>
sexual intoxication); a phenotype quite different from human aging. However,
<BR>
if you castrate the marsupial mice, they end up developing a senescence that
<BR>
ressembles that in normal mice and even in humans (e.g. exponential increase
<BR>
in mortaliy, diseases of the old age, etc.).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I'd be in line for experimental procedures that have been demonstrated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to extend the lifespan of mice to 5+ years.  Even CR can't manage that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accomplishment.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm interested in that too (mice's senescence is not much different than
<BR>
human senescence).
<BR>
<P>Sorry for the late answer. Best wishes.
