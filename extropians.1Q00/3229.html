<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Using a comment by Robert as a departure onto a new thread,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I wish to ask a question I and my friends have been pondering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for some time:  How do we teach children born in the 90s values
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;appropriate to their times?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Background:  my regular social group consists of 4 couples:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;6 engineers, 1 computer scientist, 1 CPA.  We all went to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;college together.  Two couples have one child, I have none,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;4 kids total.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;All the adults grew up in times where money was not plentiful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Now, money *is* plentiful, at least for those who invested
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;aggressively (I didnt  {8-[  dammit.).  We were all taught to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;work hard, save money in the bank, buy the biggest house
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you can possibly afford because inflation will come along and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;make you a hero, etc.  These advises turned out to be...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;well, you decide.  Inappropriate for our times.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;My grandfather told me the two very most important skills for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any young man to have are: auto mechanics and self defense.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;OK.  One has been marginally useful, mostly as a hobby,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the other totally useless.  Grandpa never saw a computer,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;so I would not expect him to understand the usefulness of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;learning to use one, however:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How can we avoid passing on similarly inappropriate values
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the next generation?
</EM><BR>
<P>One value that will never go out of style is: information.  You can never be 
<BR>
too rich or too well informed.  One of the very few values I feel 
<BR>
comfortable in whole-heartedly instilling in my own kids is to seek to be 
<BR>
well informed.
<BR>
<P>Like most parents, I do not hesitate to let my kids know what my own 
<BR>
opinions are about such things as &quot;spirituality,&quot; values, ethics, morality, 
<BR>
etc.  However, I always make clear to them that daddy does not have a lock 
<BR>
on the truth and my own opinions could very well be dead wrong.  I try to 
<BR>
instill in my children that one of the obligations they have as humans is to 
<BR>
be accept the responsiblity of seeking out truth for themselves, and not 
<BR>
accepting the word or opinion of anyone else merely because of that person's 
<BR>
presumed authority (whether it be daddy, the preacher or the president).
