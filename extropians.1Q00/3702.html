<P>Ill go reveiw that paper and compare with my own work.  Thanks!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You may be confusing me with someone else, I don't have an AOL address.
</EM><BR>
<P>oops my bad.  Apologies to aol.  But no, I had not confused you with
<BR>
another.  I replied twice to your offline comments and was bounced
<BR>
by your .aeiveos address, not by aol.  Perhaps I had been frustrated
<BR>
by .aol once too often trying to reach EvMick, and went off after seeing
<BR>
all those consecutive vowels in the return address.  {8^D  Did you
<BR>
find a buncha extropian messages missing?  How would you know?
<BR>
<P>That gives me an idea: we should post on the extropian website or
<BR>
some volunteer's site the *number* of posts each day.  Then if you
<BR>
go on vacation you can verify if you received *all* the posts.  spike
<BR>
<P>[This assumes of course that one *wants* all the posts...  {8^D  ]
