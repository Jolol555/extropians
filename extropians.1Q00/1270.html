<EM>&gt; &gt; I really like your sociogram, Spike.  I only spot one difficulty -- as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you suggest, extremes tend to meet because they are really the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; two opposing faces of one thing, &quot;Agnostic::Dogmatic Atheist&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; doesn't seem to work very well.  Here's what I suggest, even
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; though it's a bit more complicated:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Positivist-Humanist-Liberal-Orthodox-Fundamentalist-Atheist-Nihilist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I like it.  Max More will likely weigh in on this, as this I think is his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; area of expertise.  The problem I see with your spectrum above is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it places the similar humanist and atheist too far apart, nearly opposite.
</EM><BR>
<P>[1] I see very little similarity between &quot;humanism&quot; and &quot;atheism&quot;; I regard
<BR>
Humanism as the transformation of Christianity into a secular Ethos, but
<BR>
atheism as the negation of Christianity. [2] I visualize this continuum
<BR>
as in fact a spectrum from an extreme affirmation of the secular through
<BR>
the &quot;white&quot; sacred to the &quot;black&quot; sacred (or demonic) to an extreme denial
<BR>
of the secular. [3] To illustrate my intention, substitute &quot;Fascist&quot; for
<BR>
&quot;Atheist&quot;; then we can place &quot;agnosticism&quot; within the range of &quot;Humanist&quot;
<BR>
which is where I think it belongs (c.f. Schweitzer's &quot;The Quest for the
<BR>
Historical Jesus&quot;) and atheism between Fascist and Nihilist. This has a
<BR>
historical justification -- although the word &quot;Nihilism&quot; originated in the
<BR>
fiction of Turgenev around l855, it later became closely associated with
<BR>
the Ideology of Radical Revolution developed by Marx, Lenin and Trotsky.
<BR>
[4] Finally, we must be able to bend our linear continuum into a circle
<BR>
to that the &quot;ideological distance&quot; between elements is relative to one's
<BR>
theory of &quot;dynamic opposition&quot; and the geometry chosen.
