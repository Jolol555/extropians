<EM>&gt;           Many faith-healing practitioners of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hypnosis induce trance-like receptiveness
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           in their prey by physically stunning them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They &quot;lay on hands.&quot; Starting with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           their hands on the crown of the victim's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;head, they utter their hypnotic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           suggestions (i.e. &quot;prayers&quot;) while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gradually moving their hands down the side
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           of the person's head. Finally, when their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;hands are on the person's neck and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           ears, they will suddenly put pressure on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the nerve-rich cavity behind the ear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           and on the carotid sinus farther down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;neck. This stuns and disorients the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           victim, and he or she becomes very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;imprintable. The verbal suggestions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           the healer become implanted within as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little as two or three seconds. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           Of course, this does not always work. If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the person being &quot;healed&quot; has a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           weak cardiovascular system, or if the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;healer&quot; presses on the carotid sinus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           too long, cardiac arrest may result and
</EM><BR>
god
<BR>
<EM>&gt;cheats the evangelist out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           poor bloke's money. At least one notorious
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;faith healer of our day has given
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           up the practice because of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;embarrassing and expensive side-effect. The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           reader must realize, this method of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inducing hypnosis is extremely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           dangerous, and no competent practitioner
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will employ it. Only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;           religionists still flirt with it. 
</EM><BR>
Cool:) *note to self: learn to pull off that nerve
<BR>
pinch technique*
<BR>
And I like the use of the word prey in here, nice
<BR>
touch:)  It reminds me of my old pet scorpion.  I had
<BR>
an emporer scorpion once that I kept as a pet...
<BR>
Pandinus Imperator, seven foot long, black, african
<BR>
scorpions, with about as much poison per sting as a
<BR>
fairly angry bee... but still very pretty and
<BR>
interesting to watch.  Anyways, it reminds me of the
<BR>
way a scorpion will hold it's prey right in position
<BR>
for as long as a day or two while it's eating... sort
<BR>
of a creepy image.
