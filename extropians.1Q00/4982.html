<EM>&gt; The problem with military nanotechnology isn't that it is military but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that nanotech defenses might be withheld or suppressed in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; promote national security. That military forces are going to apply
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nanotech is a virtual certainty. The technologically leading nations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are (not by coincidence) democratic nations with a strong interest in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protecting themselves first and second the ability to exert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; force.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think that if you dissect the relationship between specific nanotech
<BR>
threats and their countermeasures a bit more carefully, this begins to look
<BR>
unlikely.
<BR>
<P>Against the threat of artificial pathogens, including gray goo, the
<BR>
appropriate defense is nanotech immune systems.  I would expect this
<BR>
technology to grow out of medical research, as we move from treating natural
<BR>
diseases to guarding against artificial ones and finally to regulating
<BR>
populations of nanobots.  That implies that the general population (and
<BR>
their pets and possessions) will tend to develop significant resistance to
<BR>
simple nanobot attacks over time.
<BR>
<P>Against more detectable threats, like armies of minted robots, I'd expect
<BR>
the military to be an effective defense.  An early warning system capable of
<BR>
detecting large-scale manufacturing should be feasible, which means a sudden
<BR>
overwhelming surprise attack would be difficult to pull off.  A system of
<BR>
small rapid response forces backed by larger units in central locations
<BR>
should provide an effective general defense.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Hence a lot of work is going to be done on nanodefenses, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allowing them to spread into the hands of the public or to other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nations might be counterproductive - it would make potential enemies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; less vulnerable to their own weapons, and possibly give them the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chance to work on cracking the defenses. This creates a situation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where the military possess defenses intended to be deployed in case of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an attack, but the public may be less well protected especially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against low-level attacks.
</EM><BR>
<P>What you want the civilians to have is defenses against nanobots, small
<BR>
infiltrations of micro-scale robots, and other such stealth attacks.  A
<BR>
system that defends you against these threats isn't going to be any good at
<BR>
all against a full-scale invasion.
<BR>
<P>As I've said before, the military will continue to use macro-scale weapons
<BR>
even in a nanotech age.  A group that uses an intelligently chosen weapon
<BR>
mix scaled all the way from nanobots to warships can easily defeat a force
<BR>
with an equal mass of nanobots.  This is actually just another special case
<BR>
of the forces that make economic specialization so effective - there is an
<BR>
infinite number of potential 'ecological niches' for weapon systems, and the
<BR>
more of the possibilities you explore the more effective your forces can be.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is actually something we can start working on right now, by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suggesting good policies on how to deal with nanowarfare and starting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a debate on making direct nanoweapons as politically unusable as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bioweapons. If we start it rather than the luddites, then we can maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep it from becoming &quot;ban all nanotech because it will kill us all&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or &quot;nanotech them all and let God v2.0 sort them out&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think you are defining 'nanoweapon' to narrowly here.  Simple
<BR>
pathogen-like nanobots have been the major focus of attention, but they
<BR>
aren't an especially good weapon for anyone but terrorists.  The military
<BR>
would tend to develop a smooth continuum of devices at every scale from the
<BR>
macro to the nano, which makes it much harder to create this kind of
<BR>
distinction.
<BR>
<P>OTOH, you might be able to discourage early efforts at making synthetic
<BR>
super-microbes, and that is high on my list of things to avoid.  We have no
<BR>
idea how hard it will be to make nanobots that are immune to natural
<BR>
biological defenses, or whether they will be easier to make than artificial
<BR>
defenses capable of stopping them.  However, I think it is clear that we
<BR>
don't want to find out the answers the hard way.
