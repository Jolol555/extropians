<EM>&gt; So, recumbents are safer, faster, and more comfortable.

<EM>&gt; Bicycle people, why dont you ride a recumbent?  spike

<P>Are they those weird lying-down bikes that get stuck in the tread of
<BR>
semi-trailers?
<BR>
<P>Spike, get yourself an electric bicycle engine. They are (almost) silent
<BR>
(really!), will push you along at up to 30 klicks (you'll have to figure
<BR>
that out in the old money), and is addive with pedalling; ie: you pedal hard
<BR>
enough to go fairly slow, you go really fast. Those engines are just damned
<BR>
excellent; fantastic in traffic (gives you the accelleration you really
<BR>
need), and very cool for the long haul. Before I dropped out into
<BR>
telecommuting land, I was commuting 40km round trip every working day by
<BR>
bike, only because of the engine. Especially excellent, because Canberra has
<BR>
fantastic bike paths, and a bicycle with an electric engine is not a motor
<BR>
vehicle which requies registration. Now of course my exercise is the walk to
<BR>
the beach...
