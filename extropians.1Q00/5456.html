<P>
<EM>&gt; My interest in this is the opposite directions that Vermont and California
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to be going in.  This would seem to give us a preview of the potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;enclaves&quot; that may develop in terms of use of nanotech, biotech, medtech,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privacy, etc.  The question becomes -- would the people in Vermont view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the situation in California as a sufficient violation of human rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as to go to war over it?  Or is it entirely in the legal/governmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realms?
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd be very surprized if the majority in California who voted for prop 22
<BR>
(and with whom I am now ashamed to share citizenship) get what they want.
<BR>
&quot;Full faith an credit&quot; is taken very seriously by federal courts.  What
<BR>
will likely happen is that a couple will join a Vermont civil union, move
<BR>
to California, apply for some benefit of marriage, be denied, and appeal
<BR>
to Federal District Court, which will rule prop 22 in violation of the
<BR>
full faith and credit clause.  The ninth circuit will uphold, and the USSC
<BR>
will deny review.  Of course this may take a few years.
<BR>
<P>Another big battlefield that will come up soon is federal recognition of
<BR>
Vermont civil unions, which will probably follow the same course.  The IRS
<BR>
will deny a joint filing, or he INS will try to deport a &quot;spouse&quot;, and
<BR>
that suit will also be ruled in favor of recognizing a Vermont civil union
<BR>
as a marriage in full force.  The opposition will continue to be vocal and
<BR>
continue to lie and whine about it, but they will lose.
<BR>
<P>I'm not at all surprized that Vermont was the first one to get it right.
<BR>
Californians have proven many times that they don't care about freedom and
<BR>
individual rights, while Vermont and New Hampshire always have.
<BR>
