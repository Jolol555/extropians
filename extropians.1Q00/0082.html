<EM>&gt;I heard of this one experiment - it was very interesting. It involved a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;species of monkey (I forget exactly what species) which is very hierarchy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;driven. There is one monkey, male, who is the top monkey, and nobody fucks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with him. He is the only monkey who gets to mate with the females, and he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;has a special rock that he sits on that no other monkey dares approach. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;took a group of these monkeys, and removed the top monkey from the group.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;They placed him in a room which was separated from the rerst of the group 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a one way mirror. He could see the rest of the monkeys, but they couldn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;see him. He watched while the weakest monkets of the group mated with his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;favorite females and sat on top of his rock. He went nuts - making that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;insane screaming monkey sound, running in circles. The other monkeys were 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course unaware that he was watching. The experimenters took before and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;after
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;blood tests of the top monkey, and various hormonal levels dropped
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;significantly after the experiement. I wish I knew what happened after he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;was re-introduced back into the group.

This kind of research has been replicated many, many times with various 
<BR>
species.  Not trying to put you down at all - this is very interesting 
<BR>
material of the kind that ought to be considered in the context of how to 
<BR>
design an upload system....  But there are sources like the abstracts for 
<BR>
experimental psychology that list tens of thousands of experiments along 
<BR>
these lines.  &quot;Mounting&quot; behavior is very common among a lot of the monkey 
<BR>
and ape species as a sign of dominance.  Dogs also show alterations in 
<BR>
hormonal levels as I recall from the '60's experiments.  (I took grad-level 
<BR>
Exp. Psych. in 1970.)
