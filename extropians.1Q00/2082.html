This sounds _so_ much like a really good article from _The Onion_ to me,
<BR>
but I'm worried that because I think that, I'm probably showing how
<BR>
little I understand comedy. Oh my, good thing I'm sitting down. Boy,
<BR>
this thinking is hard work.
<BR>
<P>Boy, I'm emailing that to me at work, so I can thing some more about it
<BR>
later.
<BR>
<P>Whew. Boy oh boy. Mmm.

<EM>&gt; Incompetent People Really Have No Clue, Studies Find They're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; blind to own failings, others' skills
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; There are many incompetent people in the world. Dr. David A.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dunning is haunted by the fear that he might be one of them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dunning, a professor of psychology at Cornell, worries about this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because, according to his research, most incompetent people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do not know that they are incompetent.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the contrary. People who do things badly, Dunning has found
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in studies conducted with a graduate student, Justin Kruger, are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; usually supremely confident of their abilities -- more confident, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact, than people who do things well.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``I began to think that there were probably lots of things that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was bad at, and I didn't know it,'' Dunning said.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One reason that the ignorant also tend to be the blissfully
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-assured, the researchers believe, is that the skills required
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for competence often are the same skills necessary to recognize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competence.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The incompetent, therefore, suffer doubly, they suggested in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; paper appearing in the December issue of the Journal of Personality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and Social Psychology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``Not only do they reach erroneous conclusions and make unfortunate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; choices, but their incompetence robs them of the ability to realize
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it,'' wrote Kruger, now an assistant professor at the University of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Illinois, and Dunning.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This deficiency in ``self-monitoring skills,'' the researchers said,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helps explain the tendency of the humor-impaired to persist in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telling jokes that are not funny, of day traders to repeatedly jump
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the market -- and repeatedly lose out -- and of the politically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clueless to continue holding forth at dinner parties on the fine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; points of campaign strategy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In a series of studies, Kruger and Dunning tested their theory of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incompetence. They found that subjects who scored in the lowest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; quartile on tests of logic, English grammar and humor were also the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most likely to ``grossly overestimate'' how well they had performed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In all three tests, subjects' ratings of their ability were positively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linked to their actual scores. But the lowest-ranked participants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showed much greater distortions in their self-estimates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Asked to evaluate their performance on the test of logical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasoning, for example, subjects who scored only in the 12th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percentile guessed that they had scored in the 62nd percentile,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and deemed their overall skill at logical reasoning to be at the 68th
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; percentile.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Similarly, subjects who scored at the 10th percentile on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grammar test ranked themselves at the 67th percentile in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability to ``identify grammatically correct standard English,''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and estimated their test scores to be at the 61st percentile.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; On the humor test, in which participants were asked to rate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jokes according to their funniness (subjects' ratings were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matched against those of an ``expert'' panel of professional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; comedians), low-scoring subjects were also more apt to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an inflated perception of their skill. But because humor is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idiosyncratically defined, the researchers said, the results
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were less conclusive.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Unlike unskilled counterparts, the most able subjects in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; study, Kruger and Dunning found, were likely to underestimate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their competence. The researchers attributed this to the fact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that, in the absence of information about how others were doing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highly competent subjects assumed that others were performing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as well as they were -- a phenomenon psychologists term the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``false consensus effect.''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When high-scoring subjects were asked to ``grade'' the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grammar tests of their peers, however, they quickly revised
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their evaluations of their own performance. In contrast, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-assessments of those who scored badly themselves were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unaffected by the experience of grading others; some subjects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even further inflated their estimates of their own abilities.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``Incompetent individuals were less able to recognize competence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in others,'' the researchers concluded.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In a final experiment, Dunning and Kruger set out to discover if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; training would help modify the exaggerated self-perceptions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incapable subjects. In fact, a short training session in logical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasoning did improve the ability of low-scoring subjects to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assess their performance realistically, they found.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The findings, the psychologists said, support Thomas Jefferson's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; assertion that ``he who knows best knows how little he knows.''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And the research meshes neatly with other work indicating that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; overconfidence is common; studies have found, for example, that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the vast majority of people rate themselves as ``above average''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on a wide array of abilities -- though such an abundance of talent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be impossible in statistical terms. This overestimation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; studies indicate, is more likely for tasks that are difficult than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for those that are easy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Such studies are not without critics. Dr. David C. Funder, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; psychology professor at the University of California at Riverside,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for example, said he suspects that most lay people have only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a vague idea of the meaning of ``average'' in statistical terms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ``I'm not sure the average person thinks of `average' or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `percentile' in quite that literal a sense,'' Funder said, ``so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; `above average' might mean to them `pretty good,' or `OK,'
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or `doing all right.' And if, in fact, people mean something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; subjective when they use the word, then it's really hard to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evaluate whether they're right or wrong, using the statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; criterion.''
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But Dunning said his current research and past studies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indicated there are many reasons why people would tend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to overestimate their competency and not be aware of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In various situations, feedback is absent, or at least ambiguous;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even a humorless joke, for example, is likely to be met with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; polite laughter. And faced with incompetence, social norms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prevent most people from blurting out ``You stink!'' -- truthful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though this assessment may be.
