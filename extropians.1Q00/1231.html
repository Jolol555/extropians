<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ecological disruption is, to a large extent, caused by government

<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Huh???  I would say the fundamental cause for ecological disruption
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is a failure to account in an economic sense (meaning in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; accounting and tax laws) for &quot;theft&quot; from the global commons.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The solution to this is not &quot;less&quot; government regulation, but &quot;more&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Then why are the governments that regulate their populations the most the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ones with the worst environmental problem areas (even where officially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they have strict environmental protections laws).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you refering to Russia or China?  And the answer would be because
<BR>
the laws are ignored in the favor of development.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If a company is using an environmental resource it has an incentive to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protect it, at least enough so it can continue to use it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, there is a perfectly rational strategy that would say, use up
<BR>
a &quot;free&quot; resource, generating enough profits to move into an entirely
<BR>
different area of business.  If you are clever about it you can probably
<BR>
do it in such a way that you leave the liability behind in some shell
<BR>
company.  Companies shift their &quot;business&quot; all the time.  Perkin Elmer
<BR>
is a company that comes to mind.  I believe they used to make semiconductor
<BR>
fabrication instruments, now they seem to have most of their eggs in
<BR>
the &quot;genomics&quot; business.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Governments, despite the rhetoric, seem to make the problem worse, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more they are involved.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, governments, particularly totalitarian variants, that are not
<BR>
really governments as much as the expression of the will of a few
<BR>
individuals making choices about how to grow.  Grow fast by
<BR>
stealing from the commons, or grow slow while preserving it.
<BR>
<P>Now, having observed the &quot;miracle&quot; of Russia, you cannot help but
<BR>
be amazed at a country that went from a feudal state to one that
<BR>
built things like the Moscow metro, high quality jet fighters,
<BR>
space stations, a large nuclear arsenal, etc. in less than 100 years.
<BR>
They did trash the environment in a number of areas in order to achieve
<BR>
this.
<BR>
<P>However -- if the Almost Anything machines arrive on the expected
<BR>
time scale (to do the environmental cleanup), then the Russian
<BR>
developmental approach will be viewed as the correct one in terms
<BR>
of lifting the greatest number of people up to the highest standard
<BR>
of living for the longest period of time (while letting technological
<BR>
advancement clean up the mess left by taking shortcuts).  So the
<BR>
only thing you can gripe about is the fact that they didn't know
<BR>
the approach would work in advance so they were taking a big risk.
<BR>
<P>Though the more libertarian among us may not like the idea of totalitarian
<BR>
states, they may make a huge amount of sense if the population as a whole
<BR>
is unaware of what may be achieved.  Now, whether these same achievemnts
<BR>
could have been accomplished using a free market system or a democratic
<BR>
political system or with greater environmental awareness or substantially
<BR>
less loss of life are questions that I will leave to the political analysts
<BR>
and historians.  For me to answer the question I'd have to run an experiment
<BR>
(being of a scientific bent...) and I don't thing the environmental impact
<BR>
statement would ever make it out of committee...
