<P>There is no need to speculate on these topics.  The machinery for
<BR>
and mutation rates in bacteria and to a lesser extent in higher
<BR>
organisms are well studied.
<BR>
<P>Good books on these topics would be DNA Replication by Kornberg
<BR>
or DNA Repair and Mutagenesis by Friedberg, Walker and Siede.
<BR>
<P>In a normal &quot;good&quot; environment, most mutations are deleterious.
<BR>
This is largely because the genomes of lower organisms are very
<BR>
dense and the highly competitive nature of their environments has
<BR>
tuned to some local optima for survival.  When a situation occurs
<BR>
that clearly poses a threat to survival, a &quot;stress response&quot; will be
<BR>
activated that increases the mutation rate.  In rare cases it might
<BR>
appear that this allows for directed mutation, but I suspect
<BR>
this might be due to some lingering genetic memory for
<BR>
how to survive in a different environment.  If you can
<BR>
figure out how to cheaply flip a gene between two forms
<BR>
that are optimal in different environments, that would
<BR>
be better than carrying around two copies of that gene
<BR>
and the regulatory machinery for flipping the expression
<BR>
from one to another.
<BR>
<P>However, most of the time, the hypermutation state simply
<BR>
changes bits at random (similar to computer ALIFE programs).
<BR>
Some bacteria get lucky and invent something new and survive.
<BR>
Most don't and die.  The strategy doesn't work for an individual
<BR>
but works for the species as a whole.  The mechanism presumably
<BR>
evolved because it is what allows species to survive what would
<BR>
otherwise be extinction events.  Species that live in very
<BR>
stable environments and are under selective pressure to
<BR>
minimize their genomes (to be physically small or replicate
<BR>
faster) will probably lose the stress response machinery.
<BR>
So the cost of being able to survive extinction events is
<BR>
limiting the environmental niches in which you can compete.
<BR>
<P>Complex animals, having invented sex are already doing a lot
<BR>
of mixing and matching and have the advantage of being
<BR>
able to carry two gene variants which allows the production
<BR>
of gg, Gg and GG individuals (where &quot;g&quot; or &quot;G&quot; is any gene) that
<BR>
have selective advantages in different environments.  That
<BR>
allows a wide variety of mutations to accumulate in the
<BR>
gene pool and extinction events will select those with
<BR>
the lucky combination(s).  An example would be the few
<BR>
percent of people who have a mutated receptor that allows them
<BR>
to be much less susceptible to HIV infection.
