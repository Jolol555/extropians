<EM>&gt; &gt; I define a &quot;fascist&quot; as one who advocates a system of government marked
</EM><BR>
by
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; centralization of authority under a dictator, stringent socioeconomic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; controls,
</EM><BR>
<P>How would economic equality be brought about and maintained?  (I'm not
<BR>
advocating this -- only trying to see how Zero will answer this.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; suppression of the opposition through terror and censorship, and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; policy of belligerent nationalism and racism.
</EM><BR>
<P>It should be noted that not all fascists are racists.  Notably, the Italian
<BR>
fascists even supported a Jewish fascist group in the 1920s.  (See Zeev
<BR>
Sternhell et al.'s _The Birth of Fascist Ideology: From Cultural Rebellion
<BR>
to Political Revolution_.)  There's also a difference, too, between wanting
<BR>
to destroy other races or ethnic groups and wanting separation of such.
<BR>
(I'm not advocating any of this, just trying to point out differences.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Michael has never given (to my knowledge) his definition of a fascist,
</EM><BR>
but
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; he has alluded to the fact that he considers me to be one.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I am not a fascist because I don't advocate fascism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; My guess is that Michael thinks I'm a fascist because I am in favor of
</EM><BR>
gun
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; control and ubiquitous transparancy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Considering that you also beleive that people are entitled to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'equitable' distribution of other peoples property (i.e. the food a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; farmer produces should be taken from him at cost), this indicates some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socialist leanings.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, though &quot;egalitarian&quot; might be a better term.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That you are for total surveillance of everyone,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including politically incorrect and/or subversive characters (whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its everyone or just a small controlling group that controls the system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is irrelevant),
</EM><BR>
<P>I have problems with ubiquitous surveillance too.  Transparency might look
<BR>
like a solution to all sorts of problems, but...  I do think that in the
<BR>
short run, any moves in that direction, will only benefit the elites and in
<BR>
the long run, if it doesn't, it will make the majority nearly omnipotent.
<BR>
Inescapable majority rule is not my idea of social paradise.  It's basically
<BR>
what Bruce Sterling would call an &quot;enforcement technology.&quot;
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and the confiscation of people's abilities to defend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; themselves against thugs (individual or governmental), which are both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policies used by fascists to hold onto power and eliminate opposition,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indicates to me that you lean toward the policies espoused by a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political party once known as the National Socialist Workers Party. Your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only saving grace is that so far as I can tell, you wish to oppress
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone equally, rather than just on minority you'd prefer to pick on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (then again, you've said a lot of things denigrating white undereducated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; males living in rural areas, so maybe you do have those leanings as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; well), but thats not much of a positive feature. Arguments you've made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on this list show that you support a minimum of 2/3 of the planks on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; platform found in the Communist Manifesto.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but people can support a variety of ideas without seeing where they
<BR>
lead.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can protest all you want, but its your own words that have placed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you in this category. If you don't like that people see you as placing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself in this category, then maybe you need to really examine what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you beleive. Any time you find yourself saying,&quot;I beleive that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should have this freedom, but.....&quot; check yourself. Its that 'but' that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kills.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think what we might say is Zero supports many planks which would lead to a
<BR>
totalitarian society -- rather than that it/she/he is a totalitarian per se.
<BR>
This, sadly, is what too many people support.
<BR>
