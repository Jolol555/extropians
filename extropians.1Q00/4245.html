<P><EM>&gt; James, the scenario you gave of skycars crashing into people on the ground 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is frightening and yet each year in the U.S. about fifty-thousand people die 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in car accidents!  And a large percentage involving the abuse of drugs and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; alcohol.  I see skycars being safer then that!  Especially with automatic 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; controls guided by gps.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cars clearly are dangerous.  A simple examination of the number of accidents
<BR>
caused by drivers falling asleep makes that point very clear.  Now, the critical
<BR>
factor with regard to air cars is &quot;booking a flight path&quot; and maintaining it.
<BR>
Given that current Boeing jets can land themselves, presumably Air-cars could
<BR>
do so as well.  The proper problem set is therefore the protocol between the
<BR>
pilot and the auto-pilot when there is a disagreement over who is right.
<BR>
If the autopilot had said &quot;land the plane on any mechanical malfuctions&quot;
<BR>
then the recent Alaska Airlines crash might not have occured.  It may be
<BR>
appropriate to give people control over the autopilot, but only when you
<BR>
can verify the pilot is not drunk or asleep and he/she has a machine
<BR>
that functions within his/her experience realm to work with.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have a friend here in Anchorage who is a pilot of many years experience 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and he also has serious reservations about the moller skycar similar to your 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; own.  He basically thought they were cool looking deathtraps! lol
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, you have to differentiate between the experience of pilots with no
<BR>
VTO&amp;L and/or computer experience and/or those air-vehicles that have fail-safe
<BR>
mechanisms such as multiple engines or parachutes.
<BR>
<P>Extrapolations of &quot;current experience&quot; onto &quot;future technology&quot; should be
<BR>
examined, but not assumed to be Gospel.
<BR>
<P>There will come a time when *every* pilot's experience based on 1, 2, 3 engine
<BR>
aerospace vehicles is *irrelevant* vis-a-vis vehicles with millions of engines
<BR>
based on MEMS/Nano technology.  Extrapolations have their limits.
