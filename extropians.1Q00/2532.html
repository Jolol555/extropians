<P><EM>&gt; Is that really making it more interesting, or just more of a hunt. I

<EM>&gt; hear that men enjoy the hunt more than the act, but this takes the cake!!

<EM>&gt; PS

<P>Well, personally speaking, I'm pretty sure I enjoy the act(s) more
<BR>
than the hunt.  The hunt seems pretty much like a waste of time.
<BR>
Much better would be an encapsulated exchange of information that
<BR>
determine whether or not mutually acceptable criteria and interests
<BR>
are satisfied.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As a monogamous female, not prone to bragging &quot;I got laid last night&quot;, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea of going on 10,000 dates with 10,000 lawers, engineers, architects, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doctors, bodybuilders or whatever, and listening to 10, 000 evenings of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conversation about them, with their sole intent being finding one right sex 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partner -  my hair stands on end.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think your comment proves my point.  Now we accept this process
<BR>
as part of being &quot;human&quot;.  Since it is &quot;moderately&quot; successful for
<BR>
some subset of the population it survives as a common human activity.
<BR>
If on the other hand the costs were *much* higher to achieve the &quot;goal&quot;,
<BR>
we would expend the energy required to make it much more efficient.
<BR>
Social and biological scientists would presumably expend much more
<BR>
energy exploring compatibility criteria and we would presumably get
<BR>
a refined process rather than the hit-or-miss situation we seem to
<BR>
currently have.
<BR>
<P>The once-in-a-blue moon physical compatibility issue would make it
<BR>
much simpler, our embeded watch-agents would inform us that only
<BR>
on February 28, 2117 would our physical equipment be in sync sufficiently
<BR>
to allow mating.  In the meantime, we could relax and simply get to
<BR>
know each other and find out what we might have to offer (other than
<BR>
sex) that would be of mutual interest.
