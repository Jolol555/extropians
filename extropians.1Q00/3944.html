<EM>&gt; Just an FYI, that's not how the fictional &quot;Star Trek&quot; transporter allegedly

<P>James, I believe is correct in a classical sense.  This is covered in
<BR>
some depth in &quot;The Physics of Star Trek&quot;.  If I recall, they basically
<BR>
concluded that the energy costs were too huge to allow transporters
<BR>
to ever work in a &quot;classical&quot; sense.  However, in my reading of the
<BR>
text, it seemed to make no sense to try and transport atoms around
<BR>
at approx. the speed of light.  Instead you want the *information*
<BR>
transported, which given the redundancy in a human body is probably
<BR>
not alot given a reasonable compression strategy.  (E.g. you only
<BR>
need one copy of your genome and some difference information in
<BR>
the cells containing mutations [if you don't want to &quot;repair&quot; the
<BR>
mutations]).
<BR>
<P>If you are just transporting the information and you encode it
<BR>
on GHz-THz carrier waves, then reconstruct the individual from
<BR>
atoms already *at* the destination location, then I believe that
<BR>
neo-transporters are possible.  Technically speaking this would
<BR>
only be a slight enhancement to an &quot;almost anything box&quot;.
<BR>
<P>But I doubt this would have been a good strategy for the S.T. writers.
<BR>
Most people (including myself) are inherently uncomfortable with
<BR>
having themselves dismantled and a replicant assembled elsewhere.
<BR>
They really want *themselves* to be move at light speed from one
<BR>
location to another.  Until each of us wrestles with the meme of
<BR>
&quot;what&quot; *we* really are its going to be hard to be satisfied with
<BR>
replicant transport rather than actual transport.
<BR>
<P>I would note that there is some confusion in S.T. about how the
<BR>
transporters actually work.  In S.T.N.G. there is an incident
<BR>
where Riker gets replicated into 2 copies of himself.  If atom
<BR>
transport were in fact the methodology, either you would get 2 
<BR>
dwarf Rikers, or a very big energy bill to create the atoms
<BR>
of a second Riker from raw energy.  That would be unlikely to
<BR>
have gone &quot;unnoticed&quot;.
<BR>
<P>R.
