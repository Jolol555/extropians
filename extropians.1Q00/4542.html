Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Podospora anserina is a filamentous fungus with a limited life span. It
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;expresses a degenerative syndrome called senescence, which is always
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;associated with the accumulation of circular molecules (senDNAs) containing
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;specific regions of the mitochondrial chromosome. A mobile group II intron
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(alpha) has been thought to play a prominent role in this syndrome. Intron
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;alpha is the first intron of the cytochrome c
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oxidase subunit I gene (COX1). Mitochondrial mutants that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;escape the senescence process are missing this intron, as well as the first
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;exon of the COX1 gene. We describe here the first mutant of P. anserina that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;has the alpha sequence precisely deleted and whose
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cytochrome c oxidase activity is identical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to that of wild-type cells. The integration site of the intron is slightly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;modified, and this change prevents efficient homing of intron alpha. We show
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;here that this mutant displays a senescence syndrome similar to that of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;wild type and that its life span is increased about twofold. The introduction
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of a related group II intron into the mitochondrial genome of the mutant does
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;not restore the wild-type life span. These data clearly demonstrate that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;intron alpha is not the specific senescence factor but rather an accelerator
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;or amplifier of the senescence process. They emphasize the role that intron
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;alpha plays in the instability of the mitochondrial chromosome and the link
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;between this instability and longevity. Our results strongly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;support the idea that in Podospora, &quot;immortality&quot; can be acquired not by the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;absence of intron alpha but rather by the lack of active
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cytochrome c oxidase.

Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The objective of this study was to further elucidate the role of oxidative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stress in the aging process by determining whether or not the rates of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mitochondrial superoxide anion radical and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;production, the activity of cytochrome c
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oxidase, and the concentration of protein carbonyls are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;correlated with the life span potential of different species. A comparison
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;was made among five different species of dipteran flies, namely, Drosophila
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;melanogaster (fruit fly), Musca domestica (house fly), Sarcophaga bullata
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(flesh fly), Calliphora vicina (blow fly) and Phaenecia sericata (a species
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of blow flies), which range more than 2-fold in their life span potentials.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The average life span potential of these species was found to be inversely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;correlated with the rates of mitochondrial superoxide and H2O2 production and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;with the level of protein carbonyls, and to be directly related to the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;activity of cytochrome c oxidase. The
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;significance of these findings in context of the validity of the oxidative
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stress hypothesis of aging is discussed. It is inferred that longer life span
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;potential in these insect species is associated with relatively low levels of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;oxidant generation and oxidative molecular damage. These results accord with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;our previous findings on different mammalian species.
