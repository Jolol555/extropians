<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for the in depth response!  When discussing these types
<BR>
of things to my religious family, I try to use restraint, but you're a
<BR>
great extropian who I really respect so I'm going to be a bit more
<BR>
blunt with you, using harsh language.  This is the kind of stuff I
<BR>
always want to say to religious people, but I never get the chance.  I
<BR>
hope you can just ignore it all as me just venting here.  Anyway, you
<BR>
said:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If there is an afterlife then they will be alright but if not then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it will be a great loss.  Have you told them about cryonics?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps, they would surprise you by being interested.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not only have I told them about it, this has become a huge
<BR>
fight in our family.  For the most part I've given up on them every
<BR>
seeking after cryonics, they think Jesus has done it all for them.
<BR>
I'm simply seeking to find some successful way to work around their
<BR>
insistence that they will do anything legally possible to try to
<BR>
prevent me from being cryonicly preserved.  (So the little bit of
<BR>
Money I'd like to not spend during my life and set it aside for this
<BR>
can be taken used for those that survive....)  What I really want most
<BR>
is for an ET, or God or whatever to either come down and tell me my
<BR>
family is right, that faith in Jesus is all that is required, or to
<BR>
tell my family that one must do a little more than simply have faith,
<BR>
and beg for some other being to do it for us while we do nothing
<BR>
ourselves.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; you wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How smart does an ET have to be before he knows that that is the one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and only most fundamental and important of all question or issue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that must be dealt with first before anything else?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; He just may not see things the way you do.  A different perspective
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and value system that comes from a different culture and biology.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again, he/she/it may wish he could help us but it is better for us
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to make our own way and gain the confidence and experience that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would come from that.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, the old &quot;God's ways are not Man's ways&quot; theodicy or
<BR>
justification of all this evil and attempt to accept all this shit.
<BR>
Can we not have more faith that something better than all this is
<BR>
possible rather than seeking to try to twist evil as if it were really
<BR>
good and eternally necessary?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is everyone, instead of trying to hope for and think of
<BR>
creative ways to overcome or do without all this shit so intent on
<BR>
justifying it and accepting it as inevitable and something that must
<BR>
eternally be?  Why can't we hope that supper powerful beings can find
<BR>
some better easy way to &quot;gain the confidence and experience that would
<BR>
come from that&quot; or to do whatever reason you're trying to come up with
<BR>
in an attempt to justify all this evil.  Why can't we hope that supper
<BR>
beings, when they reallly do exist, can find better, less evil and
<BR>
painful ways to do all this like create some non feeling abstract
<BR>
&quot;simulator&quot; to find out or accomplish whatever it is you feel can not
<BR>
be done without real live and feeling beings going through all this
<BR>
frustration and suffering!?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And we both know that at least some religions teach that this life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is just the blink of an eye to God and that we must simply endure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and do the best we can until it is over.  In the next life we will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gain all the rewards we deserve and see this life as a very short
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but crucial learning experience.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bull Shit!  Even if I have only experienced this pain and
<BR>
suffering for a mere &quot;blink of an eye&quot;, if I'm up their in some heaven
<BR>
watching others go through the same misery during a mere &quot;blink of an
<BR>
eye&quot; eternally wishing that I could find some way to help them
<BR>
(without going to jail?) so they wouldn't have to suffer like I we
<BR>
did, that would be eternal hell just the same!  I hope to be all
<BR>
knowing some day, or at least as close to that as possible.  To me
<BR>
this would include experiencing, just what other primitive beings
<BR>
were experiencing, as if I was suffering it myself.  Again, if we must
<BR>
give up faith for something better like you are attempting to argue,
<BR>
then we are left without hope for anything better than eternal
<BR>
hellfire and damnation for someone somewhere since if anyone is
<BR>
suffering, really, everyone else must also suffer, if they are close
<BR>
to being all knowing and all sympathizing anyway.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope to God you and all this hideousness are wrong, that I
<BR>
will not have to sit up their in some heaven, hiding for an eternity,
<BR>
(or going to jail for not hiding...) watching all the evolving
<BR>
populations suffer through what we suffered.  I hope we can find
<BR>
reasons and infinitely better ways to do whatever it is we you claim
<BR>
we are accomplishing on our own without all this suffering.  That we
<BR>
will be able to go in and help them do whatever it is we are tyring to
<BR>
do on our own, infinitely faster and with less pain, frustration, and
<BR>
suffering...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, why are you so faithless, and so quick to give up hope
<BR>
that something better might be possible for our children and for
<BR>
future discovered beings... and everyone?  Instead of trying to
<BR>
justify and accept all this, isn't it much better to hope that it can
<BR>
all be completely overcome?
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe if there isn't yet such Gods, Maybe if there isn't yet
<BR>
such supper smart ETs, then maybe, instead of spending all of our time
<BR>
trying to find silly excuses like this to justify why they are hiding.
<BR>
Instead of irrationally trying to twist all this evil as if it were
<BR>
some how really good, can't we hope that something better might be
<BR>
possible?  If God doesn't yet exist, might evil be easier than we
<BR>
think to be completely overcome and eliminated for everyone forever
<BR>
more?  It seems to me that if there is not yet powerful beings like
<BR>
this, then we can have hope that not only might it be possible to
<BR>
completely overcome evil, but that we are on the verge of finally
<BR>
being able to do just that.  But if there already is such Gods, then
<BR>
we will forever have no hope, and must be condemned to an eternity of
<BR>
watching someone somewhere suffer as we are now suffering.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Comments?
