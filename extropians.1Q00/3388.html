<P>
I found Elizer's post quite extraordinary.  I wanted to bring up some 
<BR>
points.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I see myself taking the hand of my friendly grown-up seed-AI-become-&gt;Power 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and walking directly into the land of superintelligence, &gt;discarding or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;epiphenomenalizing any parts of myself that turn out &gt;to be unnecessary.
</EM><BR>
<P>So your &quot;child&quot; will have grown up and reward his &quot;father&quot; with godlike 
<BR>
powers?  I hope you survive it's adolescence!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I honestly believe there's something worth doing, something worth &gt;being, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on the other side; that there *is* a better way, that it's &gt;possible to win 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;completely,
</EM><BR>
<P>Win completely?  Aren't there always sacrifices to be made for the things we 
<BR>
want?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;let intelligence specify a world without evil.
</EM><BR>
<P>Isn't there always a snake in the garden?  Can we overcome mistrust of 
<BR>
eachother and the lust for power?  Ever?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And if so, there's no point in clutching at the way things happened &gt;to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;turn out.  Even taking it slow, I'd undoubtedly wind up in the &gt;same place 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in a few thousand subjective years. There's no point in &gt;waiting. It's not 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the rational thing to do.
</EM><BR>
<P>So upload/transcend as quickly as possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Even here, it's possible to look at the world...and let go.  I've &gt;accepted 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I'm leaving this place.  I've said my goodbyes.  Have &gt;you?- --
</EM><BR>
<P>How have you said your goodbyes??  You still have at least several decades 
<BR>
left in coporeal form.  I will wait to say mine...
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
