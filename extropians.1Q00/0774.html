<P>This site contains some pretty powerful marketing
<BR>
info. From it I can see that I should be able to improve
<BR>
my already good marketing results by doing more to
<BR>
establish credibility. I highly recommend the above
<BR>
site to everyone involved in marketing, including the
<BR>
marketing of Extropianism.
<BR>
<P>Here's a draft of an article to be added to
<BR>
&lt;<A HREF="http://www.bigbooster.com/business_opportunities/">http://www.bigbooster.com/business_opportunities/</A>&gt;:
<BR>
<P>WHAT QUALIFIES US TO RECOMMEND THESE PROGRAMS?
<BR>
<P>The programs we promote are evaluated and approved by Mr.
<BR>
Frederick Mann. Mr. Mann has over 20 years' experience as
<BR>
a computer programmer, systems analyst, and independent
<BR>
computer consultant. He has worked and practiced in Belgium,
<BR>
England, South Africa, and USA on a wide range of computers
<BR>
ranging from PCs to large mainframes. He has designed and
<BR>
programmed mostly commercial and financial systems, including
<BR>
systems dealing with risk/reward assessment in areas such
<BR>
as commodity and options trading and reinsurance. One of his
<BR>
specialties was making computer systems more efficient.
<BR>
<P>Since 1993, Mr. Mann has gained a great deal of experience
<BR>
with &quot;money-making programs&quot; of all sorts. He has constantly
<BR>
looked for programs that provide the best reward/risk ratios. He
<BR>
has lost money with some programs and made considerable
<BR>
money with others. Over the years he has refined the criteria
<BR>
for selecting the best programs and rejecting those less likely
<BR>
to produce hefty profits.
<BR>
<P>WHAT CRITERIA DO YOU USE TO SELECT YOUR PROGRAMS?
<BR>
<P>1. Can you make money with the program without having to
<BR>
recruit others or selling anything? About 90% of people in
<BR>
networking (or multilevel-marketing) fail because of difficulties
<BR>
with recruiting and selling. If you can make a high return of
<BR>
10% or more per month on the money you put into a program,
<BR>
it's worthy of consideration.
<BR>
<P>2. Can you minimize your risk? Suppose you put $1,000 into
<BR>
a program, and after three months you can take out $1,200
<BR>
from the program. Your &quot;risk window&quot; would be three months.
<BR>
After you've &quot;closed the risk window&quot; by recovering your initial
<BR>
capital plus a modest profit, you're in a &quot;can't-lose&quot; situation.
<BR>
Thereafter you &quot;play the game with the bank's money.&quot; Can
<BR>
you &quot;close the risk window&quot; fairly quickly and have enough
<BR>
left in the program to continue making good money?
<BR>
<P>With some programs you can reduce your financial risk to
<BR>
zero. You don't have to put any of your own money into the
<BR>
program. You recruit others and earn bonuses and commissions
<BR>
based on their &quot;action.&quot;
<BR>
<P>3. Can you make more money by recruiting others? In our
<BR>
experience, the best programs are those where you can
<BR>
make without recruiting others, but make a great deal more
<BR>
money if you do recruit others. The easiest worthwhile programs
<BR>
for which to recruit others are those where your recruits don't
<BR>
have to themselves recruit or sell in order to make money.
<BR>
<P>(There are many what we call &quot;nickle-and-dime&quot; programs
<BR>
where you pay around $20-$100 one-time, or around $10-$100
<BR>
monthly, but you require a huge downline to make significant
<BR>
money. Our experience indicates that these programs tend to
<BR>
be a waste of time and money. Free downline programs also
<BR>
belong to this category.)
<BR>
<P>4. How quickly can you make money? If you are in a position
<BR>
to recruit others, can you make several thousand dollars during
<BR>
the first month, so that you can quickly &quot;close the risk window?&quot;
<BR>
<P>5. Is the program credible and viable? How are the funds generated
<BR>
to pay the returns? If it's purely a pyramid scheme with all payments
<BR>
coming from new entrants, the program may not last very long.
<BR>
<P>6. What's the risk from government interference? Many otherwise
<BR>
viable programs are shut down by government agencies. This risk
<BR>
can be particularly high in countries like USA, Canada, and UK.
<BR>
<P>7. Does the program operate out of a jurisdiction where legally
<BR>
no government taxes or reporting are involved? The ideal programs
<BR>
operate such that participants can gain their earnings unreported
<BR>
and without being taxed.
<BR>
<P>8. Is it a one-person operation? Our experience indicates that
<BR>
programs owned and operated by a single person are particularly
<BR>
risky. They're often fly-by-night scams.
<BR>
<P>9. Does the program have a successful track record, particularly
<BR>
regarding making payments on time? For many programs there
<BR>
are public forums on the web. From these forums you can get
<BR>
a pretty good idea of the track record of a program. We also
<BR>
use Internet search engines to look for &quot;dirt&quot; on programs.
<BR>
Brand new programs are particularly risky.
<BR>
<P>10. Do the principals have credibility? We use Internet search
<BR>
engines to check on the principals where possible. (Network
<BR>
Solutions &lt;<A HREF="http://www.networksolutions.com/">http://www.networksolutions.com/</A>&gt; has a &quot;WHOIS
<BR>
Lookup&quot; that includes many individuals involved with network
<BR>
marketing and money-making programs.) We generally attempt
<BR>
to establish personal contact with the principals or people who
<BR>
have personal relationships with the principals.
<BR>
<P>11. What is the quality of the program's website and automated
<BR>
services? Do they provide self-replicating web pages to make
<BR>
the program easier to promote? Do they provide online access
<BR>
to accounts and genealogies?
<BR>
<P>12. What is the quality of customer service? Some programs
<BR>
grow quickly and soon cannot provide much customer service.
<BR>
A really good program grows so quickly that quality of customer
<BR>
service quickly deteriorates. The company may adopt a policy
<BR>
of ignoring practically all emails and making it very difficult to
<BR>
contact them by phone. Atrocious customer service is not
<BR>
necessarily an indication that a program should be avoided!
<BR>
(Generally, you can learn enough about how the company
<BR>
operates to play their game appropriately and win big, despite
<BR>
poor customer service!)
