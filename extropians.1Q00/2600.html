<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Gene Grabowski [US Grocery Manufacturers Association] described December
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [1999] as a month of conflict with genetic engineering's opponents. 'They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hit us with everything they had, and they couldn't put us down,' said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Grabowski... 'Now, we strike back.' &quot;  Quoted by Bill Lambrecht in the St.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Louis Post-Dispatch, Jan. 9, 2000.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;With the controversy over genetically modified foods spreading across the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; globe and taking a toll on the stocks of companies with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agricultural-biotechnology businesses, it's hard to see those companies as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a good investment, even in the long term.&quot; The Wall Street Journal, Jan. 7,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 2000.

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frito-Lay (corn chips). In the US call their toll free line 1-800-352-4477.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Tell them you'll boycott their products unless they can guarantee you in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; writing that their corn chips do not contain genetically engineered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ingredients.

<EM>&gt; Blows Against the Empire: From Oakland to Montreal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Less than two weeks after &quot;The Battle of Seattle,&quot; on December 13, 1999
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Organic Consumers Association managed to organize, with the support of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a new national  coalition called GEAN (Genetic Engineering Action Network),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a noon street protest of over a thousand people outside Food and Drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Administration hearings on genetically engineered  foods in Oakland,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; California. The New York Times (Dec. 14) correctly identified the protest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as &quot;the largest rally ever in the United States against the use of genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineering in food.&quot;  In the week leading up to the protest the OCA
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telephone bank called 10,000 contacts in the San Francisco Bay area, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GEAN volunteers handed out 20,000 leaflets to consumers in front of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; supermarkets and natural food grocery stores. Both over the telephone and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the streets, the reaction of Californians to our &quot;Say No to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frankenfoods&quot; message was overwhelmingly positive. There is no longer any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; doubt that the global controversy over genetically engineered foods and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crops has spread to the USA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Five weeks later on Jan. 22 in sub-zero temperatures, a thousand spirited
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; demonstrators marched through the streets of Montreal, denouncing the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments of the so-called &quot;Miami Group&quot; (the US, Canada, Australia,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay) for trying to subvert a Biosafety Treaty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that would regulate the multi-billion dollar international trade in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetically engineered foods and organisms. Chanting  &quot;Life before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; profits!&quot; and &quot;We will not be guinea pigs,&quot; an internationalist contingent,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mobilized by Greenpeace and the Council of Canadians, called for a global
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; moratorium on gene-foods and crops. At a news conference the day before, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protester threw a pie in the face of Joyce Groote, the genetic engineering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry's top lobbyist in Canada.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But street protests in Oakland and Montreal are just the most visible signs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of increasing resistance in North America. Since the last issue of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BioDemocracy News, the Gene Giants and the Miami Group have suffered a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; number of setbacks, including the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * On Dec. 14 headline news stories reported that Jeremy Rifkin's Foundation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on Economic Trends, joined by the National Family Farm Coalition, had filed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a federal lawsuit against the Monsanto corporation, alleging that Monsanto
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had engaged in monopolistic business practices and had commercialized
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetically altered crops without first ensuring they were safe for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumers and the environment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  In late-December Credit Suisse First Boston, one of the world's largest
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and most influential financial advisors, categorized the agbiotech industry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as suffering from &quot;negative momentum,&quot; pointing out that major food
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporations are running scared and that &quot;if anyone is in control it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; appears to be environment and consumer groups.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  In a long-anticipated move, Monsanto's major stockholders forced the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company in December into a planned merger with pharmaceutical giant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn and to spin off its controversial, debt-ridden agbiotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; division into a separate company.  As the Wall Street Journal stated Dec.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 21 the planned merger &quot;is likely not only to push biotech to the back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; burner, but also to cost Monsanto its independence...&quot;  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Monsanto-Pharmacia merger comes on the heels of a similar move by European
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life science giants Novartis and AstraZeneca last year, who combined their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agbiotech divisions together in order to sell them off, &quot;effectively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; washing their hands of crop biotechnology,&quot; according to the Journal. For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more information see: &lt;<A HREF="http://www.purefood.org/Monsanto/pharmagedon.cfm">http://www.purefood.org/Monsanto/pharmagedon.cfm</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Reuters news service reported on Jan. 13 in a straw poll that US farmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plan to &quot;cut back sharply&quot; on planting genetically engineered soybeans,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corn, and cotton this year, in response to the growing global backlash
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against GE foods. Farmers told Reuters to expect reductions of 15% in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; RoundUp Ready soybeans, 22 % for RoundUp Ready corn, 24 % for Bt corn, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 26 % for Bt cotton.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Media coverage of the gene-foods controversy continued to increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; substantially in both the United States and Canada (as well as other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nations) in the last quarter of 1999. Estimates last fall, based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; computer-based searches of news articles, indicated up to a six-fold
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; increase in news stories on genetically engineered foods in North America
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in 1999 as compared to 1998.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  On Dec. 30 Bloomberg News reported that Whole Foods and Wild Oats,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the two largest natural food supermarket chains in the US, plan to ban
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetically engineered ingredients from their hundreds of private-label
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products. The two companies have combined sales of almost two billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dollars annually. Whole Foods owns 103 stores in 22 states and Washington,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; D.C., and has more than 600 products carrying its own brand name. Wild Oats
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operates 110 stores in 22 states and British Columbia, with 700 products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; under its own brand. The move puts pressure on other major US food chains
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and manufacturers to offer GE-free or certified organic products. Organic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; food--the only US food currently guaranteed to be GE-free--is the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fastest-growing and most profitable segment of American agriculture, with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; projected sales this year of $6.6 billion, representing 1.5% of all grocery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; retail sales in the US. In a 1997 poll by Novartis, 54% of American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumers said they would like to see organic become the predominant form
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of agricultural production in the US.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * In late-January leading US corn chip manufacturer Frito-Lay, a subsidiary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of PepsiCo Inc., announced that they were sending out new contracts to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their corn suppliers, asking them not to use genetically engineered corn.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The news unnerved the pro-biotech Farm Bureau, who accused Frito-Lay--like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Gerber and Heinz baby foods last July-- of &quot;caving in&quot; to US anti-biotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; activists. Frito-Lay's move also disturbed their competitors, one of whom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was quoted in the Washington Post  on February 6: &quot;If you're one of Frito's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; competitors you're saying, 'what are they up to?... Are they getting ready
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to jump out from behind a bush and bash us with a label,' boasting that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they are free of genetically engineered ingredients?&quot;  Frito-Lay is one of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the primary targets of a new &quot;Frankenfoods 15&quot; boycott campaign being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organized by the Organic Consumers Association and Friends of the Earth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For a copy of our Frankenfoods 15 leaflet in printable format see:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.purefood.org/ge/supermktleaf.pdf">http://www.purefood.org/ge/supermktleaf.pdf</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; According to Simon Harris, California field organizer for the OCA,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frito-Lay's recent moves are &quot;a sign that they're getting nervous.&quot; But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Harris also warns that &quot;Frito-Lay has gone only half way. They've admitted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that their corn contracts are only applicable to 95% of their suppliers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they can't guarantee that their cooking oils are GE-free, and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stated that they have no plans for labeling their products. Until Frito-Lay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; goes all the way and announces that they will start enforcing 'no-GE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contracts' with all their suppliers and labeling their products as free of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetically engineered ingredients, they will remain at the top of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frankenfoods 15 boycott list.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Farmers Weekly (a UK newspaper) reported on Feb. 4 that a US expert on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; potatoes, Oscar Gutbrod from Oregon State University, speaking at the Agra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Europe Potato 2000 conference in Rome, stated that USA fast-food giants
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; McDonald's, Burger King, and Wendy's were refusing to accept genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineered potatoes for their french fries. Informed sources have told
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; BioDemocracy News that McDonald's has binding contracts with at least some,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and perhaps all, of their US potato suppliers prohibiting the use of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Monsanto's Bt-spliced potatoes.  However, McDonald's, another of our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Frankenfoods 15 boycott targets, has refused to send the OCA their policy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on GE potatoes in writing.  And as Gutbrod noted in his speech in Rome,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even if America's fast-food giants have quietly banned Frankenfries from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their kitchens, the grease that they're fried in is routinely derived from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; GE corn, cottonseed, and soya.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * A federal judge ruled on January 19  that the US Environmental Protection
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Agency must &quot;respond&quot; within 60 days  to the charges in a lawsuit on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bt-spliced crops filed by attorneys for the Center for Food Safety (CFS).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In February 1999, CFS, Greenpeace, and a coalition of over 70 plaintiffs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; including  the International Federation of Organic Agricultural Movements,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sued the EPA, charging the agency with the wanton destruction of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world's most important biological pesticide--Bt. Non-GE Bt sprays have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; used sparingly by organic farmers for years, but are now under threat from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;superpests&quot; engendered by genetically engineered crops. The lawsuit calls
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for all Bt crops to be pulled off the market. Bt corn, cotton, and potatoes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make up approximately 25% of the global acreage of GE crops. See:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org">http://www.centerforfoodsafety.org</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * The US, Canada, and Argentina--who produce almost 99% of the world's GE
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; crops-- failed in their efforts to prevent any regulation whatsoever of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; international trade in genetically engineered foods, crops, medicines, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organisms at the Biosafety Treaty meeting in Montreal in January. However
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Biosafety Protocol that emerged from Montreal is at best a partial
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; victory. Bulk commodities shipments, seeds, and animal feeds will have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be labeled as containing GMOs (genetically modified organisms), but not for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at least two years, and even then vague labels will say &quot;this product may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contain&quot; rather than giving specific information. GE and non-GE crops will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not be required to be segregated in growing areas and in shipping and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; packaging, and individual food products (cooking oils, meat)--as opposed to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bulk grain or seed shipments--will not have to be labeled at all. In
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; addition the Protocol will have to be balanced and made congruent--in legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms--with WTO trade regulations. Countries will be allowed to impose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; import restrictions on GMOs, but only on the basis of so-called &quot;sound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * North American liquor giant Seagram announced on January 21 that  they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will not be accepting any genetically engineered corn or other grains next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; year.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * US Under Secretary of Commerce David Aron stated at an international
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; trade conference in the Netherlands on Jan. 21 that US exporters are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; willing to meet the EU's one percent threshold on labeling food products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; containing genetically engineered ingredients, although he told Reuters
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;labeling will actually undermine confidence in products, in government,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and in the regulatory process.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Direct action. The clandestine Earth Liberation Front sabotaged an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agbiotech lab at Michigan State University on Dec. 31, causing $400,000 in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; damages. On Jan. 21 &quot;Anti Genetix&quot; activists uprooted genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; engineered strawberries in a test plot near Watsonville, California.  The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Watsonville &quot;decontamination&quot; incident is the 21st known action taken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; against genetically engineered crops and multinational biotechnology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; corporations  in the last year in North America. It occurred just a week
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after a raid on a Federal Biotech facility in Albany, California in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transgenic wheat was destroyed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Counterpunch: The Biotech Industry Strikes Back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As we mentioned in the last issue of BioDemocracy News, the agbiotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry has launched an unprecedented multi-million dollar PR campaign to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counteract the growing power of the anti-GE movement across the globe.  As
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Edward Shonsey, CEO of Novartis told the New York Times last year,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anti-genetic engineering campaigners have &quot;crossed the boundaries of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reasonableness, and now it's up to us to protect and defend biotechnology.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To protect and defend Frankenfoods, Novartis has launched a new website
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.webackbiotech.com">http://www.webackbiotech.com</A>&gt; where, among other things, you can send off
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a bumper sticker and auto license plate holder inscribed with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slogan &quot;We Back Biotech.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As Canadian activist Brewster Kneen points out in his excellent newsletter,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Ram's Horn &lt;<A HREF="http://www.ramshorn.bc.ca">http://www.ramshorn.bc.ca</A>&gt; the biotech industry has &quot;turned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hysterical over the loss of control over the media&quot; and has launched an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all-out effort to discredit its critics and brainwash the public. As the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Ram's Horn (Jan. 2000) puts it: &quot;The flood of well-programmed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; letters-to-the-editor, op-ed pieces, and planted articles spewing the party
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; line on the wonders of biotech and decrying what they describe as the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; malicious intentions of those who resist it, is obviously not spontaneous.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In addition to its PR and media campaign, the agbiotech lobby has recently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gone on the offensive:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Reuters reported Jan. 28 that agribusiness giant Archer Daniels Midland
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Co. had reversed its four-month-old company position on requiring farmers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to segregate genetically  engineered corn and soybeans. ADM Chairman G.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Allen Andreas told the Chicago Tribune that &quot;the pendulum is beginning to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; turn back&quot; on the controversy surrounding GE crops.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * The US Chamber of Commerce, which represents 3 million businesses,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announced in early January that they were becoming a member of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pro-biotech trade association, the Alliance for Better Foods. Bill Kovacs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Chamber's vice-president for environmental and regulatory affairs, told
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Omaha [Nebraska] World-Herald Jan. 5 &quot;We are trying to raise the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; awareness of the business community that if you permit an assault on this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology, you are really opening the door for an assault on all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; technology.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Thirty-five powerful industry groups, including the National Association
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of Manufacturers, the Farm Bureau, the National Food Processors
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Association, the US Chamber of Commerce, and the Grocery Manufacturers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Association, told a US Congressional subcommittee Jan. 28 not to require
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labeling or safety-testing of genetically engineered foods. Mandatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labels would &quot;send the misleading message that the government is not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confident of the safety of the U.S. food supply,&quot; the groups stated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Specifically the 35 groups told Congress not to support a mandatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; labeling bill introduced last year by Rep. Dennis Kucinich, an Ohio
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Democrat. Kucinich's bill currently has several dozen Congressional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; co-sponsors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  Cargill, the nation's largest grain buyer, reaffirmed in December that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it would accept genetically engineered crops at all of it grain elevators
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; across North America.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Cargill's announcement &quot;settled down the market,&quot; according to Sano Shimoda 
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; BioScience Securities, a brokerage and investment banking firm in the San
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Francisco Bay area. &quot;Farmers are [now] feeling a lot more comfortable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planting genetically enhanced seed varieties,&quot; Shimodo told the Minneapolis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Star-Tribune Jan.17. According to the Tribune &quot;some analysts who advise
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; farm-commodity traders in Chicago are softening predictions they made last
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fall that farmers would back away from the new varieties. This GMO acreage
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may not be down as much as we had thought when the hype and concern was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intensifying last fall,&quot; said Rich Feltes, an analyst for Refco Inc. of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Chicago.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Monsanto announced Jan. 17 major plans for expanding GE cotton
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cultivation in China. According to a Monsanto press release there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; already two million farmers in China growing Bt cotton, while 2000
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientists in 137 labs across the country are working on new biotech crops.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * The Farm Bureau published poll results on Jan. 11--reprinted in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; newspapers all across the United States--which supposedly found that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Nearly three-fourths of American consumers would support genetically
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modified crops if the technology means farmers can reduce pesticide use.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Of course as BioDemocracy News has previously pointed out, even official
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; USDA statistics for 1997-98 show that  farmers planting GE crops have not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reduced their use of pesticides, and in fact in many cases are using more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; See &lt;<A HREF="http://www.biotech-info.net">http://www.biotech-info.net</A>&gt;The Farm Bureau poll follows in the wake
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of a number of other rather dubious polls purporting to prove that American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consumers support agbiotech. For an expose of the American biotech
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry's favorite pollster Thomas Hoban, see

<EM>&gt; * On Jan. 12, at a public meeting in Spokane, Washington, Dr. Michael
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Phillips, a spokesperson for the Biotechnology Industry Organization,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; announced that legislation will be introduced in Congress to make it a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; federal crime to trespass on or damage experimental agricultural test plots
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of genetically engineered crops.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * U.S. Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman reaffirmed on Jan. 10 that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; federal government is not likely to require U.S. food companies and grocery
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stores to put labels on genetically engineered foods. At a press conference
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in Washington, Glickman stated &quot;I, at this stage, do not see any of what I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; call mandatory or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulatory activities taking place from the government which will order
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anybody to do anything with respect to these issues, whether it's labeling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or anything else.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *  On Feb. 4, ABC national TV aired a program attacking the safety of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organic food, alleging that animal manure-based compost fertilizers used on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organic farms are contributing factors to America's ongoing E-coli food
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poisoning epidemic, and that claims that organic foods are safer and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nutritious than conventional foods are fraudulent. The &quot;20-20&quot; news program
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was directed by the infamous anti-environmental TV journalist, John
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Stossel, aided and abetted by agbiotech's favorite &quot;scientific expert,&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dennis Avery. For an expose of Dennis Avery see the back issue of this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; newsletter on our website (CFS News #16) or else the current issue of PR

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; What's Next on the FDA Frankenfoods Agenda?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; After reviewing recent industry documents as well as talking with our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sources in Washington, BioDemocracy News expects the Clinton
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Administration--possibly within the next 60 days--to unveil a new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three-pronged program of proposed federal regulations on gene-foods. These
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; regulations will be carefully packaged so as to confuse the public, blunt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; growing anti-biotech activism, and create the false impression that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Washington and the biotech industry are willing to respect consumer choice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and safety concerns over genetically engineered foods.  Our predictions are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that Clinton and Gore, backed by the giants of the food industry, will soon:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Call for &quot;voluntary&quot; industry labeling of genetically engineered foods.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In other words food manufacturers and supermarkets will be allowed to tell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you--if they want to--that &quot;this product may have been improved through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; modern biotechnology&quot; or something like that. In addition some companies,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; following the pattern of Frito-Lay, will issue vague statements that their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; products, or most of their products, are GE-free, even if they aren't.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Current voluntary &quot;consultations&quot; between US regulatory agencies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic engineering companies preparing to commercialize GE foods and crops
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be made &quot;mandatory.&quot; Of course mandatory consultations are no better
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than voluntary consultations unless they require strict, precautionary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; safety-testing, including stringent compositional analysis, toxicological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; testing, and environmental impact analyses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; * Some or all of the company data in these soon-to-be-mandatory
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; consultations will be placed into the &quot;public domain&quot; for public scrutiny.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Again unless strict pre-market safety-testing is required, including
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; long-term feeding studies for animals and humans, public disclosure of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; company data will be meaningless.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In any case, the Frankenfoods controversy will continue, both in North
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; America and across the world. Stay tuned to our website &lt;www.purefood.org&gt;
