<EM>&gt; No, you got me all wrong.  I think Linux is an improvement

<EM>&gt; over Windows - I use Linux when I get the chance, and I've

<EM>&gt; even recommended Linux to friends!
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, I was bored and made a very weak attempt at humor.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I just don't understand why it's a &quot;huge&quot; improvement.
</EM><BR>
<P>Technically Linux isn't a _huge_ improvement.  Politically it
<BR>
is, but then I'm pretty rabidly anti-IP.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Swapping Windows for Linux on 95% of the worlds PCs is Big Thing;
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't expect much actual swapping to occur.  I extremely
<BR>
stupidly predicted this sort of thing in 1994.  Live and learn.
<BR>
Unix won't ever run on 95% of the world's PC's and it will
<BR>
only run on the majority a few years after it is shipped as
<BR>
the default OS on most PC's.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; there's an oppurtunity here for the industry to push an OS that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really is a huge improvement.
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt it.  Much as DOS sucked, it was &quot;good enough&quot; to 
<BR>
dominate the 80's.  Much as Windows sucked, it was &quot;good
<BR>
enough&quot; to dominate the 90's...  Know of a non-research/vapor
<BR>
OS that on balance really is a huge improvement?  I don't.
<BR>

<BR>
<EM>&gt; The user interface isn't just graphics, at the very least
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changing the user interface in any significant way means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; changing the file system (i.e. the way the user can interact
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with 'objects' and other data, how they interact with each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other, etc; this can be done on a command line or a GUI or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever, it really doesn't matter).
</EM><BR>
<P>Arguably an improved filesystem could make an elegant
<BR>
UI easier to implement, but I don't see it as a
<BR>
requirement.  Files are just bitstreams, you can stick
<BR>
whatever you want in them.  Probably the really limiting
<BR>
thing is that designers are so used to thinking about
<BR>
a user interacting with a traditional filesystem that
<BR>
they don't often enough consider other UI abstractions.
<BR>
I say this extremely halfheartedly though, as most
<BR>
lame attempts I've seen to hide the filesystem from the
<BR>
user just causes frustration for a competent user.
<BR>
<P>For some UI improvement ideas from a guru, see
<BR>
the March edition of &lt;<A HREF="http://www.asktog.com/">http://www.asktog.com/</A>&gt;.  I'm not
<BR>
incredibly excited.
