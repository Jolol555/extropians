<EM>&gt; I saw no such thing, and neither did you.  All we saw was what the

<P>Yes, and the famous footage of atf swat team members getting shot at on the roof
<BR>
through the walls has been explaind. Apparently one of the poorly trained ATF swat
<BR>
team members that was on the roof threw a flash bang into the room where two or
<BR>
three members had already penetrated. When it went off, it blinded and startled
<BR>
them, being unprepared, and they were firing in all directions, including through
<BR>
the walls at their own men on the roof. Freindly fire.
