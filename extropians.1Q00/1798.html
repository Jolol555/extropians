<P>
Here's an interesting GM twist: cows engineered to produce milk that
<BR>
will be &quot;virtually the same&quot; as that produced by a woman.
<BR>
<P>This could be a tremendous boon to health, as breast milk has been
<BR>
shown to be much more healthy for infants than cow's milk or artificial
<BR>
formulas.  But some women can't produce milk or can't breast feed for
<BR>
other reasons.  For them to have access to a milk which truly mimics
<BR>
human milk should greatly enhance their baby's health.
<BR>
<P>It is interesting though to see that the reaction from breast feeding
<BR>
advocates is negative.  They want babies to bond with their mothers, and
<BR>
if manufactured milk is available that is as healthy as human breast milk,
<BR>
more people might avoid breast feeding and just use the formula.
<BR>
<P>I suspect that the artificial milk won't be fully as healthy as mother's
<BR>
milk, because the mother passes on various immunities through her milk,
<BR>
at least in the early days.  But perhaps after a few months it wouldn't
<BR>
make much difference.
<BR>
<P>This might be an interesting wedge issue in the natural/environmentalist
<BR>
camp; whether to support this because it will help babies who can't
<BR>
receive breast milk by giving them a more healthful formula, or to oppose
<BR>
it because it might give more excuses not to breast feed.
<BR>

<P><EM>&gt; GM COWS TO MAKE BREAST MILK SOON 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; From MIRROR,January 13th, 2000 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; JOHN VON RADOWITZ 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; HUMAN breast milk produced by cows could be on sale within the next 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; three years, it was claimed yesterday. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Scientists have bred a 20-strong herd of animals whose milk contains 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human proteins. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once they have &quot;knocked out&quot; even more of the cows' genes, they claim 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the result will be milk virtually the same as that produced by a woman. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Edinburgh-based biotechnology firm PPL Therapeutics is conducting the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research at its US subsidiary in Virginia. They are said to be discussing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; partnership deals with three infant formula companies in America and Europe. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; PPL's David Ayares said: &quot;The ultimate goal is to have a completely 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humanised milk product.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The company's work will be featured in a Channel 4 show tonight. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If the milk is treated as a new food and not a pharmaceutical product, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it could be in the shops within 30 months. But campaigners who promote breast 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; milk over bottle feeding were horrified. Belinda Phipps of the National 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Childbirth Trust said: &quot;The idea of breeding a GM cow to produce a hybrid milk 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may appeal to scientists, but parents want their babies to have a safe and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; healthy start in life.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And Pattie Rundall of Baby Milk Action said: &quot;The whole idea that this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is like human milk in a tin is absolute nonsense.&quot; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The Government said it had not received any applications for the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product to be used in the UK. 
</EM><BR>
