<EM>&gt; me.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my humble opinion that's not possible. I feel it is impossible for the same
<BR>
reason I don't believe in ghosts, vitalism of the soul, pure energy beings with
<BR>
complex intelligence's, spirits or any non material mind et cetera. I could be
<BR>
wrong but I don't think pure energy alone can retain complex information. To me
<BR>
one chunk of pure energy is the same as any other. Wouldn't there need to be, in
<BR>
computer speak, at least a simple binary like difference of one piece of energy
<BR>
to another for the most basic information storage to exist? Ironically The
<BR>
Discovery Channel just came on with a program about ghosts!! LOL
<BR>
<P>I believe for information to be stored and manipulated one needs a complex
<BR>
material apparatus to direct energy about--to and fro--like the switches and
<BR>
gates in silicon chips or the earlier transistors. I believe neurons can be
<BR>
compared to these same gates and switches. If you smash those neurons or turn
<BR>
them to dust there is no more information or mind. The energy recycles back to
<BR>
the universe without any essence from the former shape or pattern of the
<BR>
material that once marshaled it about. I mean if you turn off or smash your PC
<BR>
would you expect the wall current to retain all your data? Maybe the electric
<BR>
company has a backup of my hard drive that got fried? ;) Just kidding.
<BR>
<P>Sure we send information in the form of energy through the air unattached to any
<BR>
material thing. However, it is useless unless decoded by another material
<BR>
device. This is because it has been shaped by the original material device--be
<BR>
it digital or Morse code or whatever.
<BR>
<P>Consider the so called soul in religious terms. I'll use memes familiar to
<BR>
westerners. Suppose a person, a pious priest even, has a brain injury. Before
<BR>
the injury s/he was good and pious and caring and would never consider acting
<BR>
overtly evil (by western xian definitions). After the injury they turn into a
<BR>
monstrous evil perhaps even murderous individual. Has the soul changed? In xian
<BR>
terms is s/he now considered hell bound and damned? (as seen by other
<BR>
humans--not making assumptions about godly forgiveness, so let's not go there)
<BR>
The point is if the mind or soul were &quot;vital&quot; no amount of damage to the brain
<BR>
could affect behavior. We know it does.
<BR>
<P>Since damage to the material does affect behavior/information, then the mind is
<BR>
of the pattern in that matter not the electrochemical energy scurrying about
<BR>
from neuron to neuron. The problem with uploading as I see it is the term
<BR>
&quot;upload&quot;. It gives the impression the data and not the pattern can be moved or
<BR>
copied. Perhaps imprinted is a better term. Well that's my layman's take on it
<BR>
all. I await the inevitable criticisms. Be gentle, I don't claim to be an
<BR>
expert. Just opinionated. ;)
