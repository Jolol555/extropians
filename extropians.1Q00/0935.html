<P><EM>&gt; In the first case a very specific prediction was made (a comet will return in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; December  1758, in a certain sky location) that if did not come true, that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would have crippled if not destroyed orbital calculation using Newtonian 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mechanics, but instead the comte returned and destroyed the proviously 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; allegedly &quot;true&quot; theory of Ptolomy/Aristotle/.  
</EM><BR>
<P>So this observation DID destroy the theory of Ptolomy/Aristotle; but at the 
<BR>
same time the observation SUPPORTED the new theory of Newton.  You say 
<BR>
yourself that Newton's theory's prediction as to this comet was very specific 
<BR>
-- well, when a very specific prediction turns out to be true, then that 
<BR>
sounds like supportive evidence to me.  Aren't you deluding yourself here by 
<BR>
believing that it was the falsification by this evidence of the theory of 
<BR>
Ptolomy/Aristotle that was the thing that made knowledge grow here ?  I think 
<BR>
that here, at the same time as the Ptolomy/Aristotle theory is falsified, 
<BR>
another, new, theory is being justified.  If the new observation didn't 
<BR>
support the new theory, then we would NOT have had growth of knowledge here, 
<BR>
only a decrease of knowledge. 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the second case, Einstein's theories could have been destroyed, but the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea of universal quantity call &quot;time&quot; was destroyed instead.  Later this 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happened with mass and velocity no longer beeing thought of a changeless. 
</EM><BR>
<P>You therefore give me here an example of how an observed fact can destroy a 
<BR>
theory, i.e., how falsification can dimimish the amount of 'sure' knowledge in 
<BR>
one's head.  This is not an example of growing knowledge, but an example of 
<BR>
diminishing knowledge.  (Or do I interpret you wrongly ?)
<BR>
<P><PRE>
---
<P>&gt; There are many such example where the new theory is not proven, yet the old 
&gt; theory is destroyed and knowledge increases: Koch's postulates vs. 
&gt; spontaneous generation, Darwinism vs. Creationism,  Astronomy vs. Astrology,  
&gt; (Is this not happening with science in general vs. religion in general?).
<P>Ah !, now this I understand better.  *This* is interesting, thank you !! 
<P>So these are examples of how, it seems, science is advanced not by increasing 
the amount of 'sureness' people attribute to a set of theories, but instead by 
DECREASING this 'sureness'. 
<P>I concede that the dogmaticism which people/scientists attribute to the 
theories they 'believe' in HAS decreased at the same time that science HAS 
advanced.  
<P>So what you non-justificationalists are saying is that it is an advance of 
science to be LESS sure of yourself and thereby to open up your eyes better to 
conflicting evidence, right ?
<P>I say that this opening-up-of-eyes IS indeed very useful and necessary, but 
that the bare fact only of opening up your eyes is not enough to advance to 
better scientific theories.  This opening-up-of-eyes is very probably utterly 
necessary as a precondition to enable ANY advance to be at all possible; but 
after this enablement of a possible advance, you then still have to execute 
the action of advancing !! otherwise you will still be stuck where you are. 
<P>Decreasing your trust in e.g. the theory that you are enclosed all around by 
walls and that there is no escape out of the room, may then incite you to go 
look for doors in the wall.  Having found a door and having tried a few times 
to walk through the opened door, you then use this new evidence to falsify the 
old theory 'there are only walls'.  But that's not all: you also REPLACE your 
old theory by the (maybe less dogmatic) theory 'walls can have doors', plus 
the additional theory 'doors lead to other rooms' -- that is, you immediately 
use the evidence that falsified the old theory to SUPPORT replacement 
theories.  If you had used the new evidence ONLY to falsify the old theory, 
and had not started believing in the new replacement theories (where you use 
the new evidence as justificational evidence), then you would have had no 
advance in knowledge. 
<P>In the examples you mentioned in your mail, people first believed dogmatically 
in creationalism and astrology; so then they opened their eyes, and dropped 
their confidence in creationalism and astrology.  At the same time, however, 
people REPLACED their old theories by new ones, Darwinism and astronomy.  The 
same old evidence, increased by the new evidence which conflicts with the old 
theories, is used there to *SUPPORT* the new successor theories. 
<P>Suppose that people did not make this second step of replacing the old 
theories immediately by new ones.  In that state, people now believe NOTHING, 
they have NO theories to help them to make sense of the world.  Being a 
Buddhist monk who has succeeded in eliminating everything from his mind and in 
reaching Nirvana, does not help that monk in giving him theories/tools which 
can help him grow food or build spaceships.  Only shredding the theories you 
believe in without ever replacing them by something else does NOT make you 
more effective. 
<P>Indeed, a man believing in a theory that predicts the repetitive succession of 
the seasons in a very dogmatic and religious way, is very much better off as a 
farmer than a man who has NO theory whatsoever that helps him plan when to 
plant/sow his crops. 
<P>To make sense of the world and to be able to live in that world it is, maybe 
unfortunately, not possible to do without believing in theories that you use 
as models for how the world works.  You can replace this 'believing' by 
'temporarily and critically trusting or preferring', but that doesn't change 
the functionality of things: even when you decrease the dogmatism with which 
you adhere to your beliefs, you still USE theories in the same old way, and 
you still cannot do without theories.  If I need a theory A to help me to 
gather food and stay alive, and if I then scrap that theory, then I will die 
lest I replace my believing in theory A by believing in another theory B which 
performs the same function at least as effectively. 
<P>---
<P>I begin to suspect that maybe it is of limited usefulness to say that
non-justificationalists or justificationalists are right or wrong: the
difference probably lies mainly in the way they look at the world, and in the 
way they look at the very SAME ideas, phenomena and evidence.  
Non-justificationalists are the pessimists who say that the observation
that a bottle is already half empty is a very positive and useful
observation that helps them.  They just prefer to think in concepts that
are more negative than the concepts other people claim are necessary for
thinking.  I mean, to get along in life they rather use theories that
express things in negative terms than in positive terms -- but any
statement can be reformulated negatively without changing its meaning
(just put 'not' before everything).  Well, it's impossible to argue about
tastes.  Maybe anything from the non-justificationalist world view can be
reformulated in justificationalist terms and vice versa without this
reformulation changing any functionality of the things expressed.
