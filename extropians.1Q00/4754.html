<EM>&gt; After graduating from Heald in computer technology, and getting his first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; job, THE VERY FIRST THING HE DID was start looking for another job, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from that moment on he was NEVER without an alternate position waiting for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; him should he, at any moment, need to avail himself of it.  Consider the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brilliance of this action.  Your bosses have no leverage, if you can leave
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a &quot;better&quot; situation at the first sign of &quot;attitude&quot; from someone in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what is generally regarded as a position of &quot;greater power&quot;.  Plus, on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instant he had an offer for better money, he would walk into his superior's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; office and stick it to him: &quot;Match the offer or I'm gone.&quot;  No begging.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Just pure, undeniable leverage.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; He was, and is, always, calm and relaxed, pleasant with others, works the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way he wants to, takes lunch for as long as he wants to, etc.  Seeing how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easily he has accomplished this, makes me think that the reason more people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't do it is that they believe that being on the short end of the power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; play is an inescapable feature of being in the lower echelons of the power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; hierarchy.  They believe it can't be done.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>For me, as a worker, it's a question of professional work ethic. Of
<BR>
course I could have one or several jobs lined up immediately and leave
<BR>
whenever I felt there was cause to do so. Or even, hold the prospect of
<BR>
my leaving over my current employer so that I can act in a manner that
<BR>
suited my more leisurely side. But, the question that I ask myself is:
<BR>
Is this really how I want my work career defined? If you work in any
<BR>
kind of situation where you have a direct supervisor/manager you have to
<BR>
accept that there will be times when you and that person disagree, and
<BR>
if you happen to be wrong, but there is this perceived imbalance of
<BR>
power, then can you be managed effectively, for the good of the company
<BR>
(and consequently you as well)? To be sure, a poor work situation is
<BR>
something one should leave immediately, but to take unfair advantage
<BR>
harms everyone, including making it more likely that you will end up
<BR>
leaving for a different position.
<BR>
<P>As a high-level manager of such 'in demand' people, the first thing I
<BR>
try to establish is the level of comfort and requirements necessary in
<BR>
order to keep them working in a manner that I believe is appropriate for
<BR>
the success of the project/company.  We both know that they could get a
<BR>
job anywhere, but that's not the point. The point is, are they satisfied
<BR>
with the current situation. If not, work out something that makes them
<BR>
such without sacrificing your ability to get the job done. Work with
<BR>
them! In the computer/web industry, especially here in Seattle, anyone
<BR>
with a modicum of skill can work for astronomical sums and unbelievable
<BR>
benefits. How you compete with that is by making sure that you have a
<BR>
relationship that is clearly defined in terms of expectations, work
<BR>
policies, and the direction of authority. It all has to be agreed upon,
<BR>
otherwise it doesn't work. I don't try to make coding decisions, and I
<BR>
don't expect or want those under me to make management decisions. We all
<BR>
respect this, otherwise none of it works. And, in those situations where
<BR>
you get a person who just wants to milk the system (ie, take long
<BR>
lunches, work whenever, not answering to anyone, etc.) there is a clear
<BR>
path to take. &quot;Your skills and knowledge are valuable to this company.
<BR>
However, your work ethic is unacceptable. We recommend that you find
<BR>
employment elsewhere.&quot; Which is fine with them, since they can get a job
<BR>
fairly quickly, or have one already lined up. And, while troublesome for
<BR>
you, it's much better in the long run. In this industry at this time in
<BR>
the market, personal work ethic is the most important it's ever been.
<BR>
You have to want to work there, and part of a really good manager's job
<BR>
it to make that happen without killing the company in the process.
