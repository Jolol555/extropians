Why can we discuss such things as uploading, uplifting, singularity, space 
<BR>
cables, qualia, cryonics, nanotech... well pretty much all the bizarre stuff 
<BR>
we talk about, and none of us even thinks it the least bit... strange?  It's 
<BR>
this, friends: most all of us here must have some mental architecture that 
<BR>
is wired seriously different,
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>There must be something about each of us that causes a closer introspective 
<BR>
look at the changes technology will make to society and the individual.  And 
<BR>
also within each of us there must be a part that questions the nature of 
<BR>
society and the universe.  It must be a combination of imagination and 
<BR>
intellectual curiosity.  I can see how because many of you by being 
<BR>
engineers, scientists and computer specialists would be here but it does 
<BR>
take more then just that or we would have many more people on this list.
<BR>
<P>I was exposed to the original series, &quot;Star Trek&quot; as a kid and &quot;Cosmos&quot; 
<BR>
while a teen, and I know now that it had an effect on me which got me on 
<BR>
this list.  I loved science fiction novels and films back then as I do know. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an active imagination and would think how sad it was that we did 
<BR>
not have the amazing technologies that I read about in fiction.  I felt even 
<BR>
as a young boy that I had been born too early to see the really great things 
<BR>
that were coming.
<BR>
<P>Even my religious upbringing contributed to this.  I read books and listened 
<BR>
to tapes about the astounding and terrible events which would lead up to the 
<BR>
second coming.  It bothered me that some experts in this field felt that 
<BR>
those of my generation would not live to see these things happen.  Again, I 
<BR>
wanted a longer lifespan to see in the flesh what would really happen.
<BR>
<P>I really enjoy being on this list.  I have learned alot and made some 
<BR>
friends in the bargain.  I am surprised there are not more people on it.  I 
<BR>
still feel a little like a &quot;pioneer&quot; by being here.
<BR>
<P>sincerely,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg
