<EM>&gt;&lt;&lt; I think that to the extent that rats and monkeys are problem solvers, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  have some degree of intelligence.  But you have to keep in mind the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  difficulty/complexity of the &quot;problems&quot; they are solving.  Intelligence
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  (like most things) is a question of degree.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Oh and humor is not? Your original assertion was that since monkeys have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;humor, it's clearly not a part of intelligence.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, not quite.  The post I responded to suggested that intelligence can be 
<BR>
defined by emotion, laughter and fun, as opposed to primarily problem 
<BR>
solving ability.  I question that suggestion.  My &quot;assertion&quot; was merely 
<BR>
that it does not appear to take a great deal of intelligence to experience 
<BR>
emotion, laughter and fun.  I illustrated that assertion by pointing out 
<BR>
that monkeys and human idiots experience emotion, laughter and fun.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now that I toss you back your ball,  'it's a question of degree&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So you are saying that while monkeys often laugh at difficult complex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;euphemisms, they solve problems that are less complex/difficult  ; -
</EM><BR>
<P>I do not know that &quot;monkeys often laugh at difficult complex euphemisms.&quot;  I 
<BR>
do believe that they &quot;solve problems that are less complex/difficult.&quot;  At 
<BR>
least less complex/difficult than those solved by intelligent humans.
