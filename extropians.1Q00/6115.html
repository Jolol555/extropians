<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:mike@datamann.com?Subject=Re:%20Surveilance%20was:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000329202659.36917.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">mike@datamann.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Believe it or not I'm not stupid enough to believe that power 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;proportional
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transparency is now in place to any significant extent.  I was merely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; replying to Mike Lorrey who suggested that a system which allowed the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; guy to know more about the leaders than the leaders knew about the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; guy would lead to the leaders being assasinated forthwith.  I was just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; pointing out that that is not necessarily the case.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Without offering an evidence that it would not be. There are very few 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;today where a national leader can go about his business like an average 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The rate of assassination of national leaders is somewhere around 60%,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;worldwide. Those that stay in power longest are those who don't expose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know where you get 60%, but assuming that's true, I bet that 95% 
<BR>
percent of those assasinations occurred in closed or undemocratic societies. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Transparency will solve that.
<BR>
<P>Also, you are again mixing apples and oranges.  You are talking about the 
<BR>
state of affairs &quot;today.&quot;  I am talking about &quot;tomorrow&quot; where there will be 
<BR>
greater technological means to protect the safety of those leaders from whom 
<BR>
we require the greatest transparency.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Perhaps you came in late in the thread, but Mike Lorrey was replying to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; proposal that once a democratic &quot;Global&quot; government was in place there 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; be no need for such things as &quot;national&quot; security.  I never proposed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *all* government disappear.  I don't want to (nor expect that I ever 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;will)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; live in a global anarchy.  I presume that there will *always* be rules 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; means by which to ensure that they are complied with.  A global 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; would be no less a government than a national government.  And as long 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there is government, and as long as antitrust rules are deemed 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;beneficial to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; society, there will be antitrust rules and the means by which to enforce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;How about anti-trust action against government. After all, its a monopoly, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for one monopoly to go around destroying other monopolies is not justice, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;merely showing the hypocracy of the idea of government.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well presently its not against the law to be the only government in your 
<BR>
state.  In fact I can't think of how multiple governments per jurisdiction 
<BR>
could possibly work.  There's nothing hypocritical about it.  I think you're 
<BR>
letting your hyberole get away with you again :)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;As long as one person wants what another person has, or hates another 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;no good reason, there will always be a need for people to defend themselves
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against violence.
</EM><BR>
<P>And so?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;In your world, the average person would be deluged every day by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;notifications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that they were monitored by 200 national intelligence and law enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;agencies, 3,465,783 corporations, and 54,567,892 individuals. If you think 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;inbox is big now, wait till your xanadu is reached....
</EM><BR>
<P>You've never heard of a killfile?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Although keeping in mind that for everytime you *get* information about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; someone else you also have to *give* that same information about 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;yourself, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't know how anxious you would be to be doing research on 90% of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; population.  That could very well make you a *very* popular guy :)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So what if I tell 6 billion people what my sexual preference is? I tell 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fact, and I can get 6 billion facts on the same question about each and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;one of those people. Its not equivalent. I may have pissed off a small 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;minority, but I now KNOW a huge amount of data about a lot of people, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;gives me power.
</EM><BR>
<P>That gives you *nothing* except that X% of the population is homosexual.  
<BR>
What are you going to do with that?  Take over the world?  Here let me help 
<BR>
you: I'm heterosexual.  Only 5,999,999,999 more people to ask and then boy 
<BR>
will you be powerful.
<BR>
