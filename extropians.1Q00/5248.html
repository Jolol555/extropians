<EM>&gt; &gt; Very like &quot;Manifest Destiny&quot; during the expansionist, if not

<EM>&gt; &gt; imperialist, phase of American history. &quot;Nationalism&quot; can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; degenerate into a perverse form of religious fanaticism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This makes it sound like that phase is over.  America appears to be very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imperialist of late...  I gather it depends on how one defines imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Surely, controlling other nations' internal politics is one indicator.  If
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; so, then in the past ten years, America has interfered in Somalia, Haiti,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Bosnia, and Serbia.  It's used military intervention in all four cases
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned.  This is aside from the various and often routine bombings of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; other nations -- Iraq, the Sudan, Afghanistan.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Maybe there's some dividing line I'm missing here.

<P>I don't believe you are missing anything here, Daniel.  Because this
<BR>
letter was directed toward the issue of the management of inter-
<BR>
personal aggression involving firearms, I hoped to avoid, by the
<BR>
use of understatement, provoking any latent chauvinism within the
<BR>
reading audience which would only have occluded the message.
<BR>
<P>In my view, your statement is an accurate historical description of
<BR>
American foreign policy from Manila Bay to the present.  Which is
<BR>
not to say that, happily or not, such relations tend universally to
<BR>
be based on the use of implicit threats of violence in order to
<BR>
induce, by strength or by bluff, a stable system based on a dynamic
<BR>
balance of power.
<BR>
<P>Thank you for your insight, and giving me the opportunity to express
<BR>
my similar view without an obligation of constraint.
