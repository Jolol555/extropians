<P>(John, to keep the other John in his chair you may want to snip more
<BR>
unless its fairly old and people may not have the thread in their inbox.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; For those of us who could not make it to Extro 4, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could you tell us about whatever you are referring to?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Lets just say that Dr. Campbell and I had a fairly strong disagreement
<BR>
about how difficult it would be to use biotech to augment the human
<BR>
genome.  It isn't so much that Dr. Campbell (or Dr. Greg Stock who
<BR>
feels similary to Dr. Campbell) are personally incorrect, but they are
<BR>
basing much of their perspective (for germ line engineering) on &quot;sources&quot;
<BR>
who are the same kinds of people who &quot;print out their email to read it&quot;
<BR>
as someone recently put it.  I suggest, you can't predict the future
<BR>
based on the information that those kinds of people provide.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I hope what sparked all of this creativity (cryonics feasibility) is in fact 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; feasible.
</EM><BR>
<P>We shall see.  I'm going to do some more work on synapes structure
<BR>
and then when Eugene gets his stuff available, I'll try to encourage
<BR>
Robert F. to do a little early work on this (right now I think its
<BR>
scheduled for Volume 3 of Nanomedicine and thats a few years into the
<BR>
future).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I still say more research into improved suspension technologies 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needs to be done.
</EM><BR>
<P>Knowledge is good, so research doesn't hurt.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I am not so sure that mature nanotech will be able to repair 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the brain structure damage done by current suspension methods.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have to sit down with Nanomedicine and Eugene's forthcoming
<BR>
pictures and ask yourself whether or not there is going to be
<BR>
something the nanobots can't &quot;feel&quot; or &quot;find&quot; or some reason
<BR>
they wouldn't be able to put it back together.  Scale the cells
<BR>
up to the size of your living room after you've let a dozen 4
<BR>
year olds have a free hand with it for a couple of hours.  Is
<BR>
there anything there that you can't put back in order, patch
<BR>
or replace if its truly broken?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; What did you think of the Mike Darwin paper I brought to your attention?
</EM><BR>
Its printed, but not read yet.  I'll probably get to it to or from
<BR>
the Gravitational Microlensing conference in Cape Town next week
<BR>
(since the flight time is significantly longer than a trip to Russia).
