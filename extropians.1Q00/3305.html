<EM>&gt; Ischemic injury, AFAIK, is a very complex but highly ordered cascade of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chemical reactions.  It seems perfectly plausible that you could simulate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the process in reverse to figure out what the original tissue looked like.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The same is true of freezing damage.  Using cryptographic analysis is just a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; different way of performing the same computation, like using a neural net
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of a procedural algorithm.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the problem with the cryptographic analogy is that cryptographic
<BR>
transformations are, by design, reversible.  All the information in
<BR>
the plaintext is intentionally preserved, in scrambled form, in the
<BR>
ciphertext.
<BR>
<P>However, chemical reactions are biased in the direction of increasing
<BR>
entropy.  The body's metabolic reactions have to constantly fight
<BR>
this trend in order to maintain order.  Once there is injury or death,
<BR>
the forces of entropy will come into play.  Increase of entropy means
<BR>
loss of information.  So I think it is likely that most injuries,
<BR>
including trauma, ischemic and freezing injury, will involve some loss
<BR>
of information.
<BR>
<P>The unanswered question is whether this information loss is sufficient
<BR>
to obliterate personality, memory, and other important brain state.
<BR>
I don't think we know enough at this time to give any sort of definitive
<BR>
answer to this question.
<BR>
<P>This was my objection to the Ralph Merkle essay mentioned a couple of
<BR>
weeks ago; I thought he was excessively optimistic in claiming that the
<BR>
answer was largely known.  But other people who have actually looked at
<BR>
frozen brains, including Eugene and cryonics &quot;godfather&quot; Mike Darwin,
<BR>
seem to have a more pessimistic view.
