<EM>&gt; &gt;I don't know if anyone has thought of this before, but how about getting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Right to Life individuals to support abortion by cryopreserving aborted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fetuses?  Surely, cryopreserving them would be cheaper.  If we can get
</EM><BR>
them
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;to fund this sort of thing, it would be a way to both spread cryonics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;defuse a very deep conflict in Western societies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Interesting idea, but it would cost an extremely high amount of money per
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fetus (especially considering that most aborted fetuses are unwanted in
</EM><BR>
the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; first place),
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe, and correct me if I'm wrong here, it would be cheaper and
<BR>
technically less difficult to cryopreserved a fetus.  The earlier in the
<BR>
process of development, the less difficult also.  Why would I be stupid
<BR>
enough to believe this?  A fetus would take less material, a smaller dewars
<BR>
container (several could probably be stored in the space of one adult head
<BR>
depending on young they are).  It would be easier to stabilize (smaller size
<BR>
is easier to cool at an even rate, no?).  Human ova are already &quot;frozen&quot;
<BR>
(right?).  I'm not sure if any human larger and more developed than that has
<BR>
been frozen and revived.  (Anyone know?)  I assume damage at this level will
<BR>
be easier to repair.  Depending on the age of the fetus, there will be less
<BR>
overall differentiation in structure, so less chance for damages.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and would still leave the problem of who would eventually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reanimate and raise the child.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't have an answer for this, though if Right to Life people want to save
<BR>
the unborn, there might lie the pool of potential foster parents.  I'm only
<BR>
speculating here, but maybe one could make it part of the cryosuspension
<BR>
contract.  Or maybe people might just do it because they want to feel good
<BR>
(&quot;Hey, we saved another unborn child from death!&quot;:) and not worry about the
<BR>
long term.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Chances are, when the technology to revive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; suspended clients arrives, we will already have the ability to overcome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; many of the genetic defects that prevent would-be parents from having a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'natural' birth (i.e.: progeny with their own gene selection), and
</EM><BR>
adoption
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of such aborted fetuses would be unnecessary.  Still, your idea has some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seeds of possibility in other areas.  Eventually the price of cryonics
</EM><BR>
will
<BR>
<EM>&gt; be driven down once more people begin to sign up; I foresee that cryonics
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may be an option for wealthier parents of babies born (or fetuses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; developing) with severe birth defects.  It would at least give the parents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the peace of mind that a cure could arrive at any moment.  I suppose we'll
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; find out soon enough.
</EM><BR>
<P>Though I think, in the next decade or longer, this will occur, I was
<BR>
thinking about doing this now.  It would not be for wealthy parents but for
<BR>
people who might not want to abort yet don't want a child now.  It might
<BR>
also be a way to get Right to Life groups to fund cryonics NOW* -- not when
<BR>
the price of cryonics decreases in the next &lt;insert time frame you like
<BR>
here&gt;; has the price gone down during the past few decades!?!:) -- and this
<BR>
is all history.
<BR>
