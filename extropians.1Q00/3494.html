</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; With scanning, in its various
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; implementations, you have the problem of potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; loss of important information, as well as that pesky
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; problem of whether your consciousness will also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; transfer when your scan comes on-line, and if not,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; then where is your consciousness going to end up, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the original body, or your uploaded data?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You're sounding like a dualist here.  Consciousness is not some magic thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which floats around waiting to be embodied in one brain or another.  It is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; result, in your current organic brain, of a set of neurons performing some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operation.  Both your scanned brain and the new non-original brain, if they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meet the right conditions (that is, perform the right operations), will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce consciousness.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The real problem (which you might have been referring to) is the notion that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we want our consciousness to feel continuous during the upload procedure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So that you feel like you have actively migrated to the upload computer, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like you're still sitting in the operating room watching your new copy run
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; off having a great time.  The soft slow replacement method that Mike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned would appear to give us the former.  A scan of some sort would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to result in the latter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem, though, is this: does it matter at all.  If a brain is scanned
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and the process which is consciousness is the same in both brains then both
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will consider themselves to be the same identity.  Both will claim to have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been (and one will claim to still be) in the original body.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The one in the original body really can only say that his instantiation has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no causal relationship to the new one and therefore his awareness never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; migrated.  Scanning does not constitute a causal relationship because it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; requires no involvement of the actual process of consciousness.  He might go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on to say that having multiple instantiations does not imply that all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instantiations have the same status.  One might have been running for twenty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; years as a human brain; another might have been running for five minutes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; after an upload procedure.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But this is immaterial; a process is a process, regardless of where in its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lifetime it is started and for how long it has been running.  This reminds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me of the philosophy of mind notion of intensionality, which I never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accepted as it seems to claim that past causal relationship has something
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; important to do with current process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As far as I can tell it seems that the way to feel that your awareness is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; continuous is to use a replacement method.
</EM><BR>
<P>At which point its time to start lobbying for the forced abortion of all twins.
<BR>
ONLY ONE BABY PER BIRTH! A scanned upload is not the original, but a softclone
<BR>
of the original. As far as the rest of the world is concerned, it does not
<BR>
matter, of course, but to the individual, the rest of the world can go suck
<BR>
eggs.
