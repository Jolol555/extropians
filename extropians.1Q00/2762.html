<EM>&gt; citizens having given the government peacefully their FICA taxes in return
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for expectation of minimal retirement income would find themselves bereft.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's my point, the way the system is setup, the government is promising
<BR>
to take from the future generations to support the retirement of the current
<BR>
(or past generations).  Now, I believe they will worm out of this by allowing
<BR>
an expansion of retirement accounts and a pseudo-privitization of the S.S.
<BR>
system allowing you to manage your own retirement.
<BR>
<P>Now, if at some point the government hands you or sees the development of
<BR>
an &quot;almost anything&quot; box forthcoming, then it may feel free to eliminate
<BR>
social security.  [It would have to substantially change the form anyway
<BR>
because there may be *many* fewer people working. (see below).]  Sure,
<BR>
some people will be annoyed, but the government can point out that it
<BR>
is no longer needed.  Since much of the National Debt has been bought
<BR>
by the S.S. trust funds, the accounts cancel each other out.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to see a breakdown of the fraction of the National Debt owed
<BR>
to private citizens or corporations vs. the amount the government owes
<BR>
the S.S. fund(s).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree that growth is in a long term upswing, but planning on it is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invitation to inflation.
</EM><BR>
<P>No!!!  The huge productivity increases allowed by the &quot;A.A.&quot; boxes
<BR>
should prevent any inflation.  The key thing is do you have *growth*
<BR>
in excess of inflation. You might even get &quot;deflation&quot; because once
<BR>
the &quot;A.A.&quot; boxes make you one of everything you need, you aren't
<BR>
going to be buying much in terms of raw materials.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Properly directed government funding is that towards research and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; development, as far as I know the only indicator of increase in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; productivity, that is the rate of increase in productivity is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; linearly and positively linked to R&amp;D.
</EM><BR>
<P>Nope, we've discussed this before, the rate of increase in things
<BR>
like Medline articles is exponential (with a moderately low exponent).
<BR>
You can probably go back through the archives for last year and find
<BR>
discussions by Robin or myself on this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well, people will grow older, and be older longer.  Social Security will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to be reformed, as is evidenced by rising retirement ages.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, raise them now to make it &quot;look&quot; good and not send people into
<BR>
a panic and then eliminate the entire program sometime down the road.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Health care costs would be a rising burden, that would have to be solved.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's why its important to distinguish between health care treatments
<BR>
that &quot;fix&quot; problems (e.g. replacement organs or gene therapies) vs.
<BR>
treatments that &quot;manage&quot; problem (e.g. drugs).  You have to invest
<BR>
in &quot;fixes&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; At least by that time contemporary drug patents would be expired so that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the government could be mandated to purchase &quot;generic&quot; drugs in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of necessary cases.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but you still want investments (public &amp; private) in things that
<BR>
eliminate problems on a long term basis.  Think about a syn-immune
<BR>
system that recognizes all known viruses and bacteria and deals with
<BR>
them efficiently without causing things like septic shock (which 
<BR>
kills a fairly large number of people each year).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Could you explain what you mean by &quot;almost anything box&quot; some more.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
There are some recent articles in the archives discussing it.
<BR>
<P>Its basically a Star Trek type &quot;home&quot; replicator based on nanotechnology
<BR>
(meaning it draws its energy from the sun, and most of its raw materials
<BR>
from air, water and soil).  It has the ability to synthesize all of
<BR>
food you need, manufacuture parts for your air car, produce large numbers
<BR>
of semi-intelligent house lego-bricks (for reconfigurable shelter), etc.
<BR>
It isn't an &quot;everything&quot; box, because it will only assemble &quot;approved&quot;
<BR>
designs (see the NANO thread on how you have good security re: what
<BR>
is &quot;approved&quot;).
<BR>
<P>Now, the National Debt debate becomes irrelevant at this point.
<BR>
You don't want to pay it, move someplace else (another country,
<BR>
the moon, etc.)  Since IMO, people won't have to work for a living
<BR>
the government can't tax your &quot;wages&quot; for the S.S. system.  (Note:
<BR>
Robin disagrees with this, see his papers &amp; posts for discussion.)
<BR>
So the whole structure you have now breaks down.  Moravec thinks that
<BR>
the governments worm their way out of this by taxing the production
<BR>
of the robots (or perphaps the almost anything boxes).  But because
<BR>
of the mobility people will have, the governments are going to be
<BR>
in very strong competition with each other to keep the taxes
<BR>
relatively constrained.  I'd be living on the floating ExtroIsland in
<BR>
the Carribean with the 0.0001% tax rate (just enough to fund the free
<BR>
parties the government hosts on Friday nights).
<BR>
<P>Taxes and national debts work *only* so long as you can &quot;imprison&quot;
<BR>
the citizens.  You can see that in Russia now.  There are three
<BR>
kinds of people -- Those who have left, those who are ripping off
<BR>
the state (and plan to leave) and those who are unfortunately
<BR>
too unaware to figure out how to leave.  But the combination of
<BR>
brain drain, capital flight and poor health care are going
<BR>
drop the Russian population by several million over the next
<BR>
decade.  That will not change until they fix the tax system
<BR>
and the bureaucracy so that its a place people want to live.
<BR>
<P>I suspect ultimately that governments are going to have to
<BR>
vary their tax rates to reflect how pleasant it is to live
<BR>
someplace.  When people can live anywhere, Sweeden will *have*
<BR>
to have a much lower tax rate than the Bahamas.  Perhaps
<BR>
the biggest barrier to people relocating (especially in an
<BR>
information economy) is language.  How long will that last
<BR>
when you get &quot;wearable&quot; translators?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If it is meaning a nanotech or transmuter or combination, whoever makes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; one will become rich.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, and thats why people will fund companies to go in those directions.
<BR>
However, once the boxes are available and everyone has one, then our
<BR>
definitions for the meaning of the word &quot;rich&quot; become very very different.
<BR>
In some respects it may become a meaningless concept.  Once the
<BR>
public-service foundations realize this, they will be pushing hard
<BR>
to make these available.  These are the &quot;great levelers&quot;.
