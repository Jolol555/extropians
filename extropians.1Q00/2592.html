<P>&lt;&lt; &gt;Of course the real problem here is juridical: is
<BR>
<EM> &gt;he guilty of his crimes, or a victim of mental insanity? Is it a crime
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;to do this kind of restructuring? Should Mr. Hyde be punished but not
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt;Dr. Jekyll?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;All punishments depend on personality persistence.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;If entities are created/modified/equipped (by talents, ethical fixes,
<BR>
&nbsp;downloaded knowledge, adjusted mental patterns) specifically fo each task,
<BR>
&nbsp;and then reconfigured for the next one, the punishment is no longer
<BR>
&nbsp;revenge (the criminal entity has transformed) nor deterrent...
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;There can be some other mechanisms, such as requirement that all
<BR>
&nbsp;compiled entities should be insured by their owners/guardians... &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Mens rea!  Look for the guilty mind, the mind which had the intent to kill.  
<BR>
Those minds are to be stopped.  If a mind has been reconfigured after the 
<BR>
fact to no longer be capable of such a crime, then there is no value in 
<BR>
punishing that mind.  However, we still can &quot;punish&quot; sometimes that past mind 
<BR>
by not allowing any benefits from the murder to go where that mind wished.  
<BR>
For example, if someone kills for the inheritance, then reconfigures their 
<BR>
mind so they don't remember the desire or act of murder, and further has been 
<BR>
altered so if put in a similar situation would not choose to do so again, 
<BR>
then there is no need for punishment of that person.  However, that editted 
<BR>
version of the previous mind should receive none of the ill gotten 
<BR>
inheritance.  Of course, killing where the reward is only the death of that 
<BR>
individual can not be so easily handled.  In this case, you want to salvage 
<BR>
as much of the murdered person's hopes, dreams, responsibilities, etc.  Any 
<BR>
assets once belonging to the guilty mind could be confiscated for that 
<BR>
purpose (such as setting up a scholarship for the descendants of the 
<BR>
deceased, or cloning that person and raising the clone as the deceased would 
<BR>
have liked, etc.).
