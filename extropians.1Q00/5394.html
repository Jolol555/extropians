<P><EM>&gt; A bunch of fascinating questions, which I've had the temerity to try to

<EM>&gt; answer to the best of my abilities.
</EM><BR>
<P>Cool!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 1) Re: Microlensing &amp; dark matter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A partial answer can be found at <A HREF="http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/News/Lensing/">http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/News/Lensing/</A> 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [snip]
</EM><BR>
<P>This is large-scale dark matter, while I was more interested in the microlensing
<BR>
observations from the MACHO, OGLE, PLANET groups et al.  The best explanation
<BR>
for their data is ~400 billion 0.3-0.5 M_sun objects orbiting our galaxy.
<BR>
But one of the many problems with this work is that they can only look
<BR>
in very specific directions (nearby galaxies), so extrapolations are *iffy*.
<BR>
The Hubble north and south deep fields suffer from the same problem.
<BR>
<P>Now, I do have an explanation for the large scale dark matter... &lt;grin&gt;.
<BR>
The development of life to the limits of physics may have a large timescale
<BR>
distribution, i.e. in some galaxies it takes 3 billion years, while in
<BR>
others it takes 10 billion.  Or, some galaxies may get populated by Buddhists
<BR>
and others get populated by Klingons (which could have very different
<BR>
expansionist policies).  If either of these is accurate, then some galaxies
<BR>
will &quot;go dark&quot; relatively quickly.  If star lifting is possible, then
<BR>
calculations by Robert Freitas show that you could consume all of the
<BR>
fuel in the galaxy in relatively short order, probably leaving behind
<BR>
burned out iron memory banks, some black holes and neutron stars. Then
<BR>
they might colonize  &amp; consume neighboring galaxies that go dark, etc.
<BR>
The dark regions with mass are where life got lucky and got an early start
<BR>
or is particularly aggressive in its energy use or colonization principles.
<BR>
And yes, you are right it is kind of scarey.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 2 &amp; 3) Re: Self-replication &amp; evolution speed-limits...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Are these questions about the absolute limits under any circumstance (at 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which point I would say it looks to be around 1E-30 to 1E-40 seconds for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; both questions), or is it a question about what parameters are critical to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; setting a particular speed limit under particular circumstances. This is a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; far more complex, and IMHO a far more interesting question.
</EM><BR>
<P>They are questions about the minimum rates at which stuff can be
<BR>
built or evolve.  Since Tom McKendree and JoSH have pointed out that the
<BR>
fastest way to build stuff is to build ~0.6 the mass of your
<BR>
final product as assemblers, then have the assemblers build
<BR>
the final product (disassembling themselves as necessary), the
<BR>
question becomes how fast you can build the mass of assemblers.
<BR>
There is a very big rate-of-assembly gap between a nanoassembly arm
<BR>
replicating itself and Eric's 1 Kg replication systems.  Biological
<BR>
micro &amp; macro-scale replication rates seem to fall between Eric's
<BR>
doubling times.  There are a host of sub-questions -- what
<BR>
determines the final limit?  Chemical reaction rates?  Tip movement
<BR>
time? Delivery of material to the tip?  Heat removal?  What makes
<BR>
the fastest material?  Do TiC &quot;biochemistries&quot; do better because
<BR>
it can tolerate higher operating temperatures (i.e. less volume
<BR>
and energy needs to be devoted to heat removal)?
<BR>
<P>With evolution its a similar can of worms.  Xenology by Robert Freitas
<BR>
lays a foundation for some of the various &quot;natural&quot; biochemistries that
<BR>
could exist in the universe.  Does life develop in any of them?  Does
<BR>
it develop faster or slower?  How dependent is the rate of evolution on
<BR>
the available mass?  Operating temperature?  Mutation sources?  Global-scale
<BR>
stresses (extinction events)?  Are there artificial biochemistries
<BR>
in which evolution can proceed more quickly?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 4) Re: number of useful &quot;biochemistries&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you are limiting yourself to chemistry then the answer depends on how 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; big a difference is necessary to consider two biochemistries 'distinct'.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [snip discussion re large # of amino-acids].
</EM><BR>
<P>I wasn't so much interested in Carbon/Water biochemistries (there are
<BR>
clearly lots of those) as Carbon/Ammonia or Carbon/H2S or systems
<BR>
based Si or TiC or InGaAs.  You have 92 natural elements, how many ways
<BR>
can they be put together to produce self-replicating systems that can
<BR>
&quot;host&quot; intelligent consciousness?  For extra credit determine which
<BR>
chemistries are optimal for the architectures in Question 9...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; 6) Re: Breakout of amoral alife...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; About the same probability that a chemist mixing amino acids in a lab will 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accidentally create a plague-form capable of wiping out our species.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Not clear.  There are a few labs doing life creation and
<BR>
evolution of enzymes experiments and those experiments presumably
<BR>
work with moderately large number of molecules.  But, there are a lot
<BR>
of bits flying around and that high rate of growth means that the
<BR>
quantity of information being played with by computers exceeds the
<BR>
quantity being played with in chemistry experiments at some point.
<BR>
Would an AmoralAlife@Home program find the &quot;dark&quot;-ring before the chemists do?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Note that this is a vastly lower probability than the chance that a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deliberately constructed, amoral, self-evolving, self-replicating AI/Alife 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will &quot;breakout&quot; by accident.
</EM><BR>
<P>We have examples of those today with computer viruses.  Fortunately
<BR>
there aren't any nanoassemblers for them to take over and the people
<BR>
doing the ALife work are pretty responsible and we seem to be getting
<BR>
better at producing firewalls and speeding up the rate at which
<BR>
software loophole fixes are applied (for example there are bots now that
<BR>
crawl the net warning people about security holes).
<BR>
<P>Thanks Sterling for taking the time to respond.
