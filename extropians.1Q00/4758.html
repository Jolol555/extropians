<EM>&gt;From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=Re:%20Ooh%20a%20gun%20fight!!%20(Was%20Re:%20near%20anything%20boxes%20allowed...)&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000313203225.73741.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;You have a point? Don't even try to start a gun rights flame war with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;me.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't do flame wars.  Thanks anyway.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Facts are that guns are what keeps as many people in this country in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;circulation as possible. Proven fact, undeniable. Largest statistical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;database examined to date (and the most unbiased one).
</EM><BR>
<P>What database?  Where can I see it for myself.  If as you say, it is really 
<BR>
&quot;undeniable&quot; then I won't deny it.  I doubt however that there is any such 
<BR>
&quot;proven&quot; and &quot;undeniable&quot; evidence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I can also retort
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that there should be more hateful cartoons about people and groups that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;think that law abiding citizens have no right to defend their lives
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;against criminals.
</EM><BR>
<P>As to the need for such cartoons, suit yourself.  As for the words you seem 
<BR>
to be trying to put in my mouth, I never said, or suggested, any such thing.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Do you really want to continue?
</EM><BR>
<P>Only if you can turn down the posturing and the rhetoric and turn up the 
<BR>
facts and a *reasonable* debate.
<BR>
<P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
