<P><EM>&gt;	Let's consider one particular shade of deep cherry red.  Let's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;take a very high end digital color reproduction device.  Such devices
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could produce hundreds of different shades of that red which you, I,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the worlds best artist, or any human could never distinguish between.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Yet a very simple &quot;color detecting&quot; device at the local paint store
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could distinguish between them all with no problem.  So I take it you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would consider such a non complex machine which is clearly superior
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to the worlds best artist at resolving differences in color, to be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;far better artist?
</EM><BR>
<P>The ability to examine and determine the pigment, hue, or saturation of a
<BR>
color such as &quot;red&quot; is irrelevant to being a superb artist.  It is what the
<BR>
visual artist &quot;creates&quot; with color that awakens artistic brain power rather
<BR>
than the ability to distinguish a wave length of the visible spectrum.  
<BR>
<P>Any observer might be able to sense radiant energy with wavelengths of
<BR>
approximately 630 to 750 nanometers.  It's not only a visual sense that is
<BR>
stimulated by red.  An artist composing a score might discover inspiration
<BR>
in response to a specific color such as red.  (A bull might have a
<BR>
different perception and application if red is flagged in front of him.)
<BR>
<P>&quot;The colors that absorb light of the additive primary colors are called
<BR>
subtractive primary colors. They are red, which absorbs green; yellow,
<BR>
which absorbs blue; and blue, which absorbs red. Thus, if a green light is
<BR>
thrown on a red pigment, the eye will perceive black. These subtractive
<BR>
primary colors are also called the pigment primaries. They can be mixed
<BR>
together in varying amounts to match almost any hue. If all three are mixed
<BR>
in about equal amounts, they will produce black.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Why do two colors, put one next to the other, sing?  Can one really
<BR>
explain this?  no. Just as one can never learn how to paint.&quot;  Pablo Picasso 
<BR>
<P>&quot;There is no blue without yellow and without orange.&quot;  Vincent Van Gogh
<BR>
<P>There is no red without vibrating white -- red, orange yellow, green, blue
<BR>
and violet!
