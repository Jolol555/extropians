</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  only once as the camera passed across that angle. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  This is completely inconsistent with the FLIR 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  evidence before us. For the reflective-surface
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  theory to have any merit, it must explain how
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a single reflective object at one location can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  reflect in many directions, doing so only some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  of the time, and most important, it must explain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  how it emits rapid-pulse reflections at a rate 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  around 8 times per second. Nobody has done this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  and thus the reflective theory is without merit.  
</EM><BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To answer my own question: an object with a 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;geodesic type structure has a multifaceted 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surface that could reflect sunlight in many 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directions. However, it would be apparent as 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one moved around it, seeing different reflections 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off the different facets of its surface that the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;locations of those reflections are different. But 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the Waco '93 FLIR, flashes occur in the exact 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;same spot when viewed from different locations, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ruling out reflections off a geodesic structure. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A key point here is that the physical size of a hot 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing seen on FLIR is virtually exactly the size of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the area of white on the FLIR. In visible light, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there can be a glare that can make a bright object 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appear larger than it is, but this, I've been told 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by Allard, is not the case with FLIR. So if you 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;took a FLIR photo of the sun, it would have a hard 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;edge, unlike a visible-radiation photo. This means 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that different facets on a geodesic object would 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;not produce reflective flashes that overlap and 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thus appear to be located in the same spot. Also, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the non-regularity of flashes doesn't support the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contention of reflections off a geodesic object.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A point of clarification: in reviewing the tape,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say that the flashes at location 5 are 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;single shots, not full automatic. Shots from the 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other locations, where shooters are sometimes 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;roughly visible, are, on the other hand, clearly 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;full automatic. I'd also take issue with Allard's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;claim that gunmen are retreating, for the last
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shots on the tape where he seems to indicate 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that this occurs appear to remain stationary,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a location that they were before the fire.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Allard may very well have more tape than I.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, last week Allard suffered a massive heart 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attack that left him paralyzed on one side of his 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;body, thus he was not able to conduct oversight 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the Waco test. Last week another witness for 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the plaintiffs also died of a heart attack. Let's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hope the trial gets going before they're all dead!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, here's Allard's analysis filed in court:
