As near as I can tell, this &quot;upgrade&quot; fellow is claiming to spend a lot
<BR>
of time tracking pyramid schemes.  He can tell when a really good
<BR>
pyramid scheme is starting, get in on the ground floor, and be one of
<BR>
the people who gets paid off before the collapse occurs.  The
<BR>
possibility that people are making a living this way intrigues me. 
<BR>
Clearly what the ecosystem needs is a hyper-hyper-hyperparasite who
<BR>
would scam *them*.
<BR>
<P>(Of course, now that he's contacting others, the pyramid scheme must be
<BR>
approaching the collapse stage.)
