<P>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Not just any atheist's view, though; James Still is 
</EM><BR>
currently the president of the Internet Infidels.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>I can see how James Still may persuade people's opinion 
<BR>
from his position of authority.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;But, more importantly...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;&gt;We are the exception to the rule; there are millions of 
</EM><BR>
atheists and just a couple thousand transhumanists/
<BR>
extropians and even fewer cryonicists.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Atheists are the most likely to take advantage of cryonics. 
<BR>
Honestly I've known about cryonics for over 10 years, but 
<BR>
didn't take it seriously until recently after reading a 
<BR>
book about immortality with nanotechnology. It was the 
<BR>
first time I've ever heard of nanotechnology (not the first 
<BR>
time I thought of the idea though), and the whole time I 
<BR>
read the book I thought to myself what total lunacy! I 
<BR>
silently knew it was possible if we could control things at 
<BR>
the atomic level, but we couldn't. This book, got me 
<BR>
interested and slightly excited, and so I read another one 
<BR>
called Nano'Something', which made me a &quot;believer&quot;. Then I 
<BR>
read Engines of Creation and found this list.
<BR>
<P>You see, I only had to learn about it (though I've already 
<BR>
been working on a plan to beat death for years).  So if 
<BR>
nanotechnology was more known then nearly no atheist will 
<BR>
accept &quot;deathism&quot;.
