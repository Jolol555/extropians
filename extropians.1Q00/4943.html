<EM>&gt; &gt;In this debate, people who are against guns (or are for stricter gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;laws/enforcement, etc.) I think are missing a vital point. They want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;blanket &quot;punishments&quot; for the actions a limited few. As well, it seems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;they can't see the forest for the trees. They continually point to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;weapon as the problem. Some go a bit further and say it's access to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;weapon, or accountability of the people/dealers/NRA/parents that give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;them access to weapons. In actuality it's the mentality/psychological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;make-up of the person that uses a gun (or any weapon for that matter) to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;be destructive against another person(s). Oh, to be sure, there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;people who ask the question why. But the answer is either too complex or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;too frightening to understand that very little is done on this front.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Too many people are willing to pronounce guns as evil and ignore the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;fact that there was a person behind that weapon using it for ill. There
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;was a person with a *reason* for using that weapon the way they did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;That is where the issue lies.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No question.  I *absolutely* agree with you.  I just figured it would be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot easier to take the gun out of the psychopath's hand than it would be to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take the pathology out of his head.  If you think there's a practical way to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; legislate against pathology, count me in, I'm all for it.
</EM><BR>
<P>its rather simple: enforce the laws we have, use the current background
<BR>
check systems we have. In every case of these sensationalized stories,
<BR>
you will find that numerous laws were broken over an extended period,
<BR>
that the authorities had been warned about the risk on one or more
<BR>
occasions, and in the case of the 6 year old, the teacher took a knife
<BR>
away from him shortly before the shooting, but did not report the
<BR>
incident to the principle or send the child for punishment. I'm all for
<BR>
keeping guns out of the hands of people that are not capable of or
<BR>
willing to handle them legally. Echoing the calls on the left for better
<BR>
technology, I call for better technology that keeps crooks from getting
<BR>
guns in the first place, and that makes sure that existing laws are
<BR>
enforced to the fullest extent. After you've actually tried that for
<BR>
once and proven it doesn't work can you come cry to me. Considering the
<BR>
success of Operation Exile, I doubt very much tht it won't work.
