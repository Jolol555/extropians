<EM>&gt; *I'm* no tax lawyer either, but I really must take exception to Greg's

<EM>&gt; supposition.  Tax lawyers provide a *very* valuable and commendable service
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by helping citizens to find the lowest legal tax possible.  Granted, tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lawyers indirectly benefit from a complex and burdensome tax code.  They do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not cause it, however, and do much to help we victims of it to reduce its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harms--and the tax revenue flowing to statists.

<P>One of the strategies that I know works in tax court when you get nabbed
<BR>
for not paying taxes: You are not obligated to obey a law you or an
<BR>
average citizen cannot understand. Simply cart in a whole copy of the
<BR>
tax code (somewhere in the tens of thousands of pages), and ask the
<BR>
judge if he expects an average citizen to understand this law in whole.
<BR>
Its really great when you use some passages of the tax code which are
<BR>
50% cross references to other regulations and codes, with lots of if,
<BR>
ands/ors, etc... Let the judge try to read these passages and ask him if
<BR>
he understands what it means. Such cases are dismissed at this point.
