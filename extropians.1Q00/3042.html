<P>
I read the paper you wrote and found it interesting.  I agree that true A.I. 
<BR>
may not take off as fast as some think.  It will be interesting to see over 
<BR>
the next two decades if nanotech develops as quickly as we would like.  So 
<BR>
you think nanotech will bottleneck because of A.I. not advancing as fast as 
<BR>
hoped?
<BR>
<P>I am in my early thirties and do think that life-extension 
<BR>
technology(including nanotech) will advance enough over the next forty years 
<BR>
to ensure the reversal of aging in my body.  I will probably need to be 
<BR>
cryonically suspended to buy myself the extra few decades needed for these 
<BR>
technologies to mature.  I don't want to die just when things are getting 
<BR>
really good! lol  Neal and Ziana are lucky!
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg :)

<BR>
try to write down some of my reasons for signing up for cryonics after I was 
<BR>
caught without a ready explanation a little while back. I had nonchalantly 
<BR>
mentioned being signed up to someone whom I had thought would find it 
<BR>
ordinary. She was surprised, and I was unprepared to defend my choice.
