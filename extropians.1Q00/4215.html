Anders Sandberg reared back and wrote,
<BR>
<EM>&gt;Actually, this is where we could improve our memetic artillery. Many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people want to hear moral arguments for or against doing something,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and we should be able to give them. As long as the concept of morality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;usually falls into the purvey of conservatives, the debate will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biased. Somebody says: &quot;but what about ethics?!&quot;, there is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;embarrassed silence as most people cannot come up with anything to say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;since they do not know how to make good ethical arguments, and then a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;conservative (of any color - red, blue, green, brown, whatever) rushes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the stage, spruting his or her standard line, filling the silnce. But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if we ourselves argue for the ethics of our actions, then we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;acually use this interest in ethics to make people more open to it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Have you considered the possibility of the biological basis of morality?

<P>--J. R.

-------------------------------------------------
<BR>
&quot;Do we invent our moral absolutes in order to make society workable? Or are
<BR>
these enduring principles expressed to us by some transcendent or Godlike
<BR>
authority? Efforts to resolve this conundrum have perplexed, sometimes inflamed,
<BR>
our best minds for centuries, but the natural sciences are telling us more and
<BR>
more about the choices we make and our reasons for making them&gt;&quot;

<P>&quot;Blind faith, no matter how passionately expressed, will not suffice. Science,
<BR>
for its part, will test relentlessly every assumption about the human condition
<BR>
and in time uncover the bedrock of moral and religious sentiments.&quot;
