<P><EM>&gt; In essence, in order to compete with Ebay and the like you need some

<EM>&gt; advantage for the customer that offsets the extra trouble of dealing in BUs
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; instead of his native currency.  There isn't an obvious one, which is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably why no one is doing it.  If you can find a non-obvious advantage,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then you may have something.
</EM><BR>
<P>IMHO it all boils down to this question:
<BR>
<P>Is it possible to design a non-linear software program complex enough to match
<BR>
buyers and sellers so efficiently that currency, virtual or otherwise, is never
<BR>
needed?
<BR>
<P>Here's a better example of what I'm getting at:
<BR>
<P>Lets say you want to sell your VW.  Finally a guy contacts you who has 20
<BR>
bushels of wheat.  You don't need the wheat, but you know a guy in Texas who
<BR>
does, and he happens to have a new software program that another contact of
<BR>
yours wants. This contact happens to have 100 shares of a hot new start-up that
<BR>
you're dying to get, and she's itching to sell.  So you take the wheat, give it
<BR>
to that guy in Texas who exchanges it for that software program who you then
<BR>
give to your other contact in exchange for her 100 shares of IPO, inc.  In the
<BR>
end you traded your VW for 100 shares of IPO, inc.  Everyone gets what they want
<BR>
and *no currency* is ever used.
<BR>
<P>Is it possible, with the Internet's 100 million+ users, to create a system to
<BR>
manage all of this stuff automatically? A global bartering system so complex
<BR>
that it manages to keep track of the immense brain-like structure of buyers and
<BR>
sellers? A system that would seem to render currency superfluous?  If I'm not
<BR>
mistake supply-chain management software is doing this to some degree for B2B
<BR>
operations.  And didn't I just hear that Ford and Daimer-Chrysler are setting up
<BR>
something like this with all of their sub-contractors?
<BR>
<P>Assuming such a system could be designed, could it not escape the tax system
<BR>
entirely?  After all when was the first time you paid taxes on an item at a
<BR>
garage sale?  Except in this case its a global garage sale of new and used items
<BR>
facilitated by the Internet.
