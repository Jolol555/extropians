The following article was taken by me from the Longevity Report.  It was 
<BR>
written by Robert Ettinger and tells of his fascinating experiences with 
<BR>
Stanley Kubrick regarding cryonics.  I thought with the current discussions 
<BR>
on film this would be timely.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>Film director Stanley Kubrick has died at age 70--a mere stripling. I guess 
<BR>
he never grew up. Recent comers to cryonics--those within the last 25 years 
<BR>
or so--may be mildly amused or bemused by the following reminiscences.
<BR>
<P>In the mid Sixties, when THE PROSPECT OF IMMORTALITY was getting some press, 
<BR>
Kubrick was impressed by it and gave away dozens of copies to his friends. 
<BR>
Also interested was a fellow named Ben Schloss. Ben was a biochemist, Ph.D., 
<BR>
but mainly a wannabee entrepreneur. He learned of Kubrick's interest, and 
<BR>
arranged a meeting in New York among Kubrick, some of Kubrick's rich 
<BR>
friends, some physicians and cryobiologists, Schloss, and myself. The idea 
<BR>
was to try to arouse some practical support for cryonics, although in 
<BR>
Schloss' mind the idea was mainly to mine a little gold.
<BR>
<P>The meeting produced nothing noticeable at the time. I didn't ask for 
<BR>
anything specific (a mistake, perhaps)--just tried to motivate them to save 
<BR>
their keesters. The physicians and cryobiologists said it wouldn't work and 
<BR>
even if it did it was a bad idea and it shouldn't be tried until first a lot 
<BR>
of people had died and been revived and lived forever. Schloss didn't say a 
<BR>
whole lot at the time, but later, as it transpired, he was successful in 
<BR>
putting a small hit on Kubrick for seed money for a company promoting 
<BR>
cryonics or/and other life extension ideas.
<BR>
<P>As I understand it, the money disappeared into Schloss' pocket and Kubrick 
<BR>
was annoyed. Schloss hung around for a while on the fringes of cryonics and 
<BR>
antisenescence, trying to sell biological age evaluation systems, then up 
<BR>
and died. Kubrick decided it was more fun to play with films and disappeared 
<BR>
into the wilds of England.
<BR>
<P>The only specific reservation about cryonics that Kubrick ever made to me 
<BR>
was the problem in getting prompt attention in an emergency. &quot;You can't even 
<BR>
get a plumber when you need him.&quot; But obviously the main problem was the 
<BR>
same one as with other people, and celebrities in particular--too much 
<BR>
trouble, too unpleasant, too likely to make your friends look at you funny, 
<BR>
too hard to get institutional support, and too many other things to do that 
<BR>
seem more pressing and more enjoyable.
<BR>
<P>He made his choice, but now he won't have to live with it.
<BR>
<P>However, the adults among us are beginning to realize that maybe there 
<BR>
really will be a tomorrow, and maybe it really will be different and better, 
<BR>
and sometimes if you want something you have to do a little work and make 
<BR>
some decisions that actually require thought.
