<EM>&gt; &gt; The one difference, however, with Native Americans, is that their
</EM><BR>
nations
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; are still recognized.  The right thing to do in their case, would be to
</EM><BR>
give
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as much land as is possible back to them and allow them to find their
</EM><BR>
way in
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the world.  We can't undo the last 500 years, but we can give all that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Federal land in the US back to them -- where it can be proven that it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their land.  Then recreation (skiing, boating, etc.), mining, and
</EM><BR>
logging
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; concerns would have to pay a more equitable price for its usage and be
</EM><BR>
less
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; likely to damage it in the process.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a rather simplistic view of the issue.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For one, the Native Americans were quite busy doing their own empire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; building as recently as the first half of the 19th century.  This was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documented by American and European explorers in addition to tribal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; histories.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't disagree with this claim.  I don't make Native Americans out to be
<BR>
helpless victims of European imperialism.  E.g., the Aztecs and the Incas
<BR>
were just empires.  That Spain conquered them was merely one empire
<BR>
conquering another.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As far as I know, this has never been taken into consideration
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and is the reason that you find tribes that are clearly from the Great
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Plains living in the Pacific Northwest and other odd distributions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; related tribes.  It is interesting to note that the Warrior-Merchant
</EM><BR>
tribes
<BR>
<EM>&gt; were among the most economically successful, both before and after
</EM><BR>
European
<BR>
<EM>&gt; domination and controlled relatively large sections of North America at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; various times.  The historical patterns of Native American politics and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conquests closely mirror European history in many respects.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As for Native Americans being better stewards of the land, this concept is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; largely a cultural myth.  In fact, some of the most egregious acts of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environmental destruction I have ever seen were perpetrated by Native
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Americans on their own land.  They are no better or worse than anyone else
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at environmental conservation.  In my experience, small private
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agricultural and forestry concerns run by ordinary Americans have among
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the best records for good environmental management (necessarily -- many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of these people have been earning a living off the same lands for many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generations, something that mandates excellent conservation practices).
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't disagree with this.  James is reading more into what I type that
<BR>
what I actually put there.  What I meant was Federal stewardship of that
<BR>
land is probably much worse than will be private Native American ownership
<BR>
of it.  (If the given tracts land the Federal government now holds in vast
<BR>
regions of the country can be shown to belong to certain tribes and given
<BR>
back to them, then I think the latter will take better care of it, simply
<BR>
because they will have an interest in not polluting or exhausting their own
<BR>
backyard.)
<BR>
<P>Again, just ot make sure no one misinterprets me, I don't paint Native
<BR>
Americans as total innocents or Red gods who know best about everything.  I
<BR>
merely talking about how private ownership of land is better than public
<BR>
ownership.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Additionally, I am strongly against making &quot;reparations&quot; to the Native
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Americans in general.  A lot of people don't realize that the U.S.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government has already paid enormous sums of &quot;reparation&quot; money to many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the tribes to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars per person.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I grew up on a couple different Reservations, and I have a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first-hand experience with the Native American communities.  Most of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; *grossly* mismanage their assets and money.  The reparations to date have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done nothing but turn most Native American tribes into welfare cases writ
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; large, waiting for their next big check from the evil white government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Their have been some movements within some of the Native American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; communities to get everyone off their collective asses and to become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; productive members of society, but most have failed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where that has been done, I would advocate that nothing is owed to those
<BR>
particular people.  I advocate doing this on a case by case basis.  Note:
<BR>
I'm not advocating giving money at all, just land.  I don't want the Federal
<BR>
government to tax James and me to pay anyone for crimes committed by that
<BR>
same government in the 1800s.  See below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And lastly, to pick a nit, the Native Americans/Indians are no more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;native&quot; than I am.  The current &quot;native&quot; Americans occupying the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; contintental U.S. are, to my understanding, invaders who pushed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; previous occupants south.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't disagree about both of us now being natives.  I only use the term to
<BR>
designate an ethnic group in the least confusing fashion.  (I live in New
<BR>
Jersey, where there are lots of Indians.  I like to eat their cuisine.  I
<BR>
work with a number of them.  But they are from the other India.:)  Perhaps
<BR>
is we use American Aborigines, it would be better?  (This also ignores the
<BR>
inbreeding between Europeans, Africans, and Native Americans.)
<BR>
<P>But one has to admit, some tribes have treaties with the US government which
<BR>
the latter has continuously set aside in a very arbitrary way.  This is why
<BR>
I advocate, where practical, giving back these tribes their land -- but only
<BR>
when it can be demonstrated that it is theirs and comes out of Federal land.
<BR>
(I'm not looking to take away James' home.:)
<BR>
<P>Also, though every piece of land on the planet with the exception of
<BR>
Antarctica has been fought over or stolen at one point or another, this has
<BR>
to be proven in each individual case.  The truth is, we do know that certain
<BR>
Europeans did take land and make treaties then broke those treaties with
<BR>
Native Americans.  I don't want to use the abstraction I started out this
<BR>
paragraph with to underline the historty which we are completely sure of.
<BR>
And that is the only wrong we can redress.
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
