<P>
<EM>&gt; For those who care, take Eliezer's experiences with school
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (including the &quot;falling out&quot; at the same age due to what I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tend to refer to as &quot;motivational problems&quot;), remove any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mention of books*, and you've got my early years.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; * I lived in information poverty - no books at home, no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; books at school...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; BM
</EM><BR>
<P>This is very interesting, because I believe I'm detecting a trend 
<BR>
here, after visiting Eliezer's singularity web pages and reading them, 
<BR>
I found some very interesting revelations, but most importantly, that 
<BR>
a lot of those concepts and ideas, were already present in my meme 
<BR>
generator (AKA brain)
<BR>
<P>And now after reading Eliezer's personal information page, I've 
<BR>
noticed that, his life has a lot of resemblance with mine, specially 
<BR>
the I can't do it part.
<BR>
<P>This makes me hypothesize that there are certain persons with very 
<BR>
special wetware configurations, very different from the other members 
<BR>
of our species. But contrary to what Eliezer wrote in his algernon's 
<BR>
law essay, I think that it is possible to have more than one mental 
<BR>
configuration, to realize very specialized tasks. And not only that, I 
<BR>
also think that instead of resorting to neurosurgery to get the 
<BR>
desired neuromods, we'll resort to, very specialized neurochemicals, 
<BR>
or mature nanotech, to program our brains to achieve the results we 
<BR>
want.
<BR>
<P>Why do I believe this? Because, I've been able to switch my 
<BR>
personality and capabilities depending on what I want, experimenting 
<BR>
with cognitive techniques and neurochemicals (both legal and ilegal) 
<BR>
and I discovered, that with careful manipulation, I was able to 
<BR>
overcome the I can't do it mental barrier that held me trapped for 
<BR>
several years, (since I was 16 to the present day to be specific)
<BR>
<P>Also I would like to add, that reading the previous messages, where 
<BR>
some people wondered if we, the members of the list were completely 
<BR>
different to most of the normal people. Led me to the conclusion that 
<BR>
maybe our wetware is really different to most of the world's 
<BR>
population, specially the way we perceive and integrate thoughts, with 
<BR>
it's obvious inherent advantages and disadvantages, that's why a lot 
<BR>
of it's members share common interests or similar episodes during 
<BR>
their life.
<BR>
<P>So I would like to ask to the members of this list, if somebody has 
<BR>
ever been able to switch or at least control to certain degree, their 
<BR>
personality, or abilities, using any possible method, Eliezer mentions 
<BR>
his tricks, I've done it using some &quot;tricks&quot; too and with the ability 
<BR>
of modern and ancient psychoactive chemicals.
<BR>
<P>Any comments?
<BR>
<P>PS I was thinking in making this a personal e-mail to Eliezer after 
<BR>
reading his page, but noticing that some people in this list has had 
<BR>
similar experiences, I thought it would be very useful to receive some 
<BR>
feedback.
