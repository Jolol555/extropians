Biotech Firms Transforming Animals Into Drug-Producing Machines
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the BREAKING NEWS discussion group
</EM><BR>
<P>_____
<BR>
<P><P>Hey Newswatchers,
<BR>
<P>Just wanted to add one news item to the discussion on cloning. A story in
<BR>
today's San Francisco Chronicle talks about the injection of human genes
<BR>
into animals, a practice called transgenics. The idea is to incubate
<BR>
proteins that be extracted from the animals and used to fight diseases in
<BR>
humans. Another noble endeavor, but does it raise more questions?

<BR>
<P>Biotech Firms Transforming Animals Into Drug-Producing Machines
<BR>
By Tom Abate
<BR>
[From San Francisco Chronicle]
<BR>
<P>Several biotech firms in the United States and Europe are giving new meaning
<BR>
to the slogan ``Got milk?''
<BR>
<P>These companies have spliced a few human genes into the DNA of goats, sheep,
<BR>
pigs and other mammals.
<BR>
<P>These human genes are designed to produce, in the animal's milk, a specific
<BR>
therapeutic protein to combat a human disease.
<BR>
<P>For instance, the animal might be bioengineered to produce a protein to
<BR>
treat hemophilia.
<BR>
<P>The therapeutic protein would be extracted from the milk, purified and
<BR>
packaged as a drug.
<BR>
<P>Putting genes from one creature into another is called transgenics. In
<BR>
short, these transgenic animals are being groomed as four-legged drug
<BR>
factories.
<BR>
<P>Transgenic drug production remains experimental.
<BR>
<P>The standard way to brew drugs is in huge stainless steel vats in a
<BR>
fermentation process that makes protein factories look like wineries.
<BR>
Proponents of transgenic production say animals will ultimately provide less
<BR>
expensive factories.
<BR>
<P>Last week at a health science conference in San Francisco, a Massachusetts
<BR>
firm called Genzyme Transgenics announced an important milestone in the
<BR>
process of getting transgenic animals approved as protein therapy producers.
<BR>
<P>The company announced positive results from a Phase III trial of an
<BR>
anti-clotting protein derived from the milk of a transgenic goat.
<BR>
<P>Phase III trials are usually the last experiment before a company seeks Food
<BR>
and Drug Administration approval to sell a product. But because this process
<BR>
is so novel, Genzyme Transgenics is running a second Phase III study to
<BR>
gather additional safety data.
<BR>
<P>``Toward the end of the year, we would expect to have the two studies in
<BR>
hand,'' said Genzyme Transgenics CEO Sandra Nusinoff Lehrman, who must
<BR>
ultimately decide whether to ask the FDA to OK the first therapeutic protein
<BR>
produced from a transgenic animal.
<BR>
<P>Genzyme Transgenics has half a dozen similar trials under way, a little
<BR>
earlier in the testing process, to determine whether goats, rabbits and cows
<BR>
can reliably produce high-quality therapeutic proteins in their milk.
<BR>
<P>PPL Therapeutics in the United Kingdom is experimenting with transgenic
<BR>
sheep's milk to produce protein drugs for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia.
<BR>
<P>Pharming NV, a biotech firm in the Netherlands, is testing whether
<BR>
transgenic rabbits, cows and mice can produce a variety of human proteins
<BR>
for stomach ailments and other bleeding disorders.
<BR>
<P>Bill Drohan, a senior research director for the American Red Cross, is
<BR>
collaborating with Pharming to create transgenic pigs to make the protein
<BR>
raw material for a new surgical bandage.
<BR>
<P>Drohan explained that human blood contains a protein called fibrinogen,
<BR>
which forms thin tendrils across a wound to trap blood and form a clot.
<BR>
<P>``If you look at a fresh scab, 90 percent of it is fibrinogen,'' Drohan
<BR>
said.
<BR>
<P>The idea behind the bandage is simple: Smear fibrinogen on a bandage and
<BR>
slap it on a wound. ``Early tests show this can stop any type of bleeding in
<BR>
15 seconds,'' he said, even gushing wounds that normally prove fatal.
<BR>
<P>Not surprisingly, the U.S. Army would love to put such miracle bandages in
<BR>
every medical field kit. The problem, Drohan said, is that today fibrinogen
<BR>
is extracted from human plasma, and the Red Cross can't imagine getting
<BR>
enough plasma donors to meet the likely demand.
<BR>
<P>Enter the transgenic pigs. ``The value of transgenic animals is that they
<BR>
can make large quantities of safe material at reasonable costs,'' Drohan
<BR>
said.
<BR>
<P>Producing protein drugs through current manufacturing processes means
<BR>
building factories that can cost upwards of $150 million. Lehrman, the
<BR>
Genzyme Transgenics CEO, said animal production systems should require lower
<BR>
capital outlays.
<BR>
<P>Not that the process is cheap, fast or easy -- yet. Scientists must first
<BR>
harvest the female animal's eggs, fertilize them in vitro and implant human
<BR>
genes into these embryos to produce the desired therapeutic protein.
<BR>
<P>These transgenic embryos must then be transplanted into surrogate mothers,
<BR>
who would give birth to the animals. Once they grow to adulthood, the
<BR>
animals that produce the highest concentration of drug in their milk are
<BR>
bred to create a herd.
<BR>
<P>Lehrman estimates it would require 30 to 100 goats to produce enough refined
<BR>
protein to supply a typical commercial drug program. It might take two or
<BR>
three years to create such a production herd.
<BR>
<P>Later this year, the FDA will hold a scientific meeting to consider the
<BR>
safety issues raised by transgenic animal production of human therapeutics.
<BR>
Drohan said one question is whether humans might develop allergic reactions
<BR>
to proteins produced in animals. So far, this hasn't been a problem, but
<BR>
regulators will take the issue seriously.
<BR>
<P>Another likely question is whether infectious agents in animals -- like mad
<BR>
cow disease -- might somehow jump to humans. Lehrman said the key thing to
<BR>
remember is that humans won't ingest the animal product directly. ``We have
<BR>
a strong downstream pharmaceutical purification process,'' she said.
<BR>
<P>Given the number of transgenic animal products in human clinical trials, it
<BR>
seems likely some will ultimately pass FDA muster. But even should animals
<BR>
become approved as therapeutic protein factories, it's still way too early
<BR>
to judge whether transgenic milk will ultimately supplant the stainless
<BR>
steel vat or simply become a niche production method.
<BR>
<P>But the very prospect of using animals as drug factories is yet another
<BR>
example of how biotechnology is altering the very fabric of life.
