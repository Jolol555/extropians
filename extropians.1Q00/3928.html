<P>In proof, almost before anyone else, as it happens.
<BR>
<P>That was a novel. This is a scientific claim.
<BR>
<P>I should add that Johnjoe's page obviously has many rhetorical defects; his
<BR>
arguments have holes; I don't care to nitpick on that level. The core idea
<BR>
itself might be a cool addition to what's going on, even though other
<BR>
partial explanations help account for some of the effects he's describing.
<BR>
(You've gotta love those superposed buckythangs, BTW.) As a critique, I'm
<BR>
more impressed by a line of thought a pal sent me, which I'll paste in to
<BR>
advance the discussion:
<BR>
<P>===============================
<BR>
<P>Anyway, Egan and this author pull the same stunt with evolution (at least
<BR>
Egan's version was speculative; he wasn't saying evolution had followed
<BR>
this course, just that it could in the future). That is, in order to
<BR>
explain the remarkable rise in evolutionary complexity, he calls on quantum
<BR>
uncertainty and talks about quantum collapse/multiple universes. But what
<BR>
he has completely failed to do is provide the slightest reason *why* the
<BR>
quantum field should collapse on an outcome that is evolutionarily
<BR>
superior. After all, in the double-slit experiment, it's still random which
<BR>
slit the photon/electron/fullerene atom goes through. The amazing feature
<BR>
of the double-slit experiment (and it is genuinely amazing) has nothing at
<BR>
all to do with selective pressure on the photon/electron/fullerene atom to
<BR>
go through a &quot;good&quot; slit preferentially to a &quot;bad&quot; slit. If you want to
<BR>
make electrons pass preferentially through one of the slits, you need to
<BR>
apply an EM field gradient across the slits. Then it will preferentially
<BR>
collapse on one of the slits. But this is the same as having selection
<BR>
pressure in biological evolution.
<BR>
<P>[...]
<BR>
<P>And let me put it a third way, this time drawing on evolutionary theory
<BR>
rather than QM. If this multi-universe/quantum collapse evolution was real,
<BR>
then presumably we'd see evolution being the result of the best mutations
<BR>
anywhere in the multiverse leaking into our reality. To me this would tend
<BR>
to indicate that evolution should have provided almost perfect gene pools.
<BR>
After all, why would we have sub-optimal peroxidase enzymes (you know what
<BR>
I'm talking about Damien) if we had access to all the possible mutations?
<BR>
We've managed to &quot;evolve&quot; better-than-natural peroxidases in laboratories,
<BR>
so how come these brilliant super-potent enzymes haven't sprung into
<BR>
existence naturally? So the quantum multiverse argument really starts to
<BR>
look a lot like the God arguments again, only not the God of the Gaps here
<BR>
but the Perfect God creating Imperfect Beings. Why did the Creationist God
<BR>
make so many silly desogn errors of he was an omniscient omnipotent
<BR>
designer? It is the most telling argument against Creationism. Likewise,
<BR>
with an infinite (or at least cosmically large) supply of parallel
<BR>
universes to choose from, why did we get so many dud features? In fact,
<BR>
given that probability goes out the window in the multiverse, why didn't we
<BR>
end up in a Universe where complex life arose spontaneously as soon as
<BR>
organic chemicals entered the universe? Why have evolution at all? Surely
<BR>
somewhere in the multiverse the complete DNA for an organism as complex as
<BR>
a human spontaneously came together? Egan's TERANESIA does actually answer
<BR>
this question by making it clear that quantum evolution was only possible
<BR>
once a bizarre gene came into existence -- an event that took 4 billion
<BR>
years of evolution on Earth. It's a fascinating concept (even if Egan does
<BR>
push the teleology into the red) when presented as speculation about future
<BR>
evolutionary trends. But it's a terrible explanation for the living
<BR>
complexity that already exists on the planet.
<BR>
<P>As you can see, I'm with Paul Davies on this one. However, it's still a
<BR>
fascinating idea and I hasten to add that I can't absolutely *exclude* its
<BR>
possibility either.
<BR>
<P>===============================
<BR>
<P>Call this the `no way, Dr Pangloss' critique.
