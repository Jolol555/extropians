<EM>&gt; &gt; So, recumbents are safer, faster, and more comfortable.

<EM>&gt; &gt; Bicycle people, why dont you ride a recumbent?  spike

</EM><BR>
<P>Ja I should clarify the safer comment.  If you ride a lot in traffic
<BR>
a bent would likely be more dangerous because they are harder
<BR>
for drivers to see.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Spike, get yourself an electric bicycle engine.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have three motorcycles for that purpose.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They are (almost) silent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (really!), will push you along at up to 30 klicks (you'll have to figure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that out in the old money),
</EM><BR>
<P>No need to convert from a good system to a bad one.  I force
<BR>
myself to think metric now.  We yanks are pokey but we are
<BR>
coming along, kicking and screaming.  {8^D
<BR>
<P>As for faster, well that depends.  If you go really fast, where
<BR>
air resistance counts, then sure, you have less wind resistance
<BR>
with a bent.  But with the smaller wheels, a bearing of a given
<BR>
resistance would have increased total rolling resistance with
<BR>
the smaller wheeled recumbent.
<BR>
<P>And of course they look silly.  And will unless they become
<BR>
a fad, and then it will be even worse, for one will look like
<BR>
a sheep following the flock.  {8-[  So in that department
<BR>
ya cant win.
<BR>
<P>And of course they are pavement only.
<BR>
<P>But they are more comfortable, not only on the buns but
<BR>
perhaps more importantly (for me) the wrists.  spike
