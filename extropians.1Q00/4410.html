<BR>
&nbsp;I became aware of the dangers of antidepressants after 
<BR>
&nbsp;Littleton gunkid Eric Harris was found to have been on the 
<BR>
&nbsp;antidepressant Luvox, prompting me to research the topic.
<BR>
&nbsp;I then realized there was probably a good reason why the 
<BR>
&nbsp;last words my Mother spoke as the cogent person she was 
<BR>
&nbsp;before her sudden decline into dementia were descriptions 
<BR>
&nbsp;of the aesthetic qualities of hallucinations that Prozac 
<BR>
&nbsp;was causing. Her doctors dismiss any possibility of a link 
<BR>
&nbsp;between her dementia and Prozac, yet she had a range of 
<BR>
&nbsp;neurotoxic reactions to Prozac and her records show that 
<BR>
&nbsp;the onset of her sudden decline was the SAME month that 
<BR>
&nbsp;she started taking Prozac! In a matter of months she went 
<BR>
&nbsp;from having a 99-percentile IQ to not being sure if people 
<BR>
&nbsp;on TV can see you. I wonder if the following study may be 
<BR>
&nbsp;shedding light on what Prozac apparently did to my Mother.
<BR>
&nbsp;The study found that large doses of SSRIs such as Prozac
<BR>
&nbsp;caused some rat brain cells to &quot;shrivel up&quot; in four days!
<BR>
&nbsp;(First is a media review followed by the study abstract):

<P>&nbsp;=========================================================
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Antidepressants Found to Alter Brain Cells in Rats 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MITCH RUSTAD 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c.2000 Medical PressCorps News Service 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A study conducted in animals raises concerns about
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the prolonged use of such commonly prescribed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;antidepressant drugs as fluoxetine (Prozac, Lilly) 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and sertraline (Zoloft, Pfizer). 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Researchers found changes in brain cells of rats
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;treated with large doses of two antidepressants and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two anti-obesity drugs. In some cases, the cells
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shriveled up or took on abnormal corkscrew shapes. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study led by Dr. Madhu Kalia, professor 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of biochemistry, molecular pharmacology,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anesthesiology and neurosurgery at Jefferson Medical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College of Thomas Jefferson University in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Philadelphia, compared the effects of four days of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high doses of four drugs: fluoxetine, sertraline,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sibutramine (Meridia, Knoll) and dexfenfluramine
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Redux), on rat brain cells. Each rat received only
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one drug. The study said that while clinical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significance of the findings isn't known, there is 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a need for similar studies of other classes of 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drugs that act on the central nervous system. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the toxic doses of drugs were halted, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the animals' brains subsequently examined, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;researchers saw marked changes in some nerve
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terminals that release the neurotransmitter serotonin. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``If any patient who's on any of these drugs, 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;takes the drug in high enough doses for long periods 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of time, there could be some changes occurring in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain,'' said Kalia. ``There is the potential that this
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could be happening. This study in animals is a red
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flag that perhaps we shouldn't use these drugs with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reckless abandon.'' 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These drugs, known collectively as selective
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), increase the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;level of serotonin, which is vital to brain cell
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;communication. Low serotonin levels are linked to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mood and eating disorders. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do these findings mean? ``We don't know if
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;results with four days of drug treatment are clinically
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;significant,'' said Kalia. ``We don't know if the cells
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are dying. That's the key question. We need to do
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more studies to prove cell death. These effects may
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be transient and reversible. Or they may be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;permanent.'' The study is published in the March 6
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;issue of Brain Research. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Serotonin is ubiquitous in the central nervous
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;system, making it a frequent target for medications.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drugs such as fluoxetine and sertraline raise
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serotonin levels to treat depression and panic attacks.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another class of SSRIs, anti-anorexics used for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight loss, includes sibutramine and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;dexfenfluramine (withdrawn from the market in 1997
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after being linked to heart-valve problems). Such
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drugs block circulating serotonin. After brain cells
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;use serotonin, it is recycled in the brain. SSRIs keep
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;serotonin from being recirculated back to the brain
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for subsequent use, allowing the chemical to stay
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active in the brain. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More than a decade ago, rat studies showed that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;high doses of dexfenfluramine could change the shape
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of some brain terminals, said Kalia. Some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;researchers attributed the effect to the fact that the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;drug was also a serotonin releaser. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``It was a big mystery why with high doses these
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain terminals looked like corkscrews,'' said Kalia.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``We asked the question, 'Would other SSRIs cause
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the same effects in high doses?''' 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some patients using some of these drugs for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long periods of time, and with scientists unsure of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;long-term effects of many of these drugs, Kalia and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;her colleagues plan to do long-term studies in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;animals. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``We will lower the doses to about 10 to 30 times
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the therapeutic dose and give it to the rats for six
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;months to a year,'' said Kalia. ``We will examine the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rats at selected time periods to see if these changes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occur in serotonin cells over the long term, or if the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;brain adjusts,'' she continued. The researchers would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;then look for behavioral and neurological effects of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any brain changes. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;``We need to find out if these changes are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effecting behavioral changes in the rat and in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patients,'' said Kalia.

<P>[Record supplied by publisher]
<BR>
<P>We compared the effects of treatment with high doses of 
<BR>
fluoxetine, sibutramine, sertraline, and dexfenfluramine 
<BR>
for 4 days on brain serotonergic nerve terminals in rats.
<BR>
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine
<BR>
(5,7-DHT) were used as positive controls because both compounds 
<BR>
deplete brain serotonin. Food intake and body weight changes 
<BR>
were also monitored and yoked, pair-fed animals were used to 
<BR>
control for possible changes in morphology due to nutritional 
<BR>
deficits. Fluoxetine, sibutramine, sertraline and dexfenfluramine 
<BR>
all produced a significant reduction in body weight. Fluoxetine, 
<BR>
sibutramine and sertraline treatment resulted in no depletion of 
<BR>
brain serotonin but produced morphological abnormalities in the 
<BR>
serotonergic immunoreactive nerve network. In contrast, 
<BR>
dexfenfluramine and MDMA depleted brain serotonin and 
<BR>
produced morphological changes in the serotonin nerve 
<BR>
network. These results indicate that even though fluoxetine, 
<BR>
sibutramine and sertraline do not deplete brain serotonin, 
<BR>
they do produce morphological changes in several brain 
<BR>
regions (as identified by serotonin immunohistochemistry). 
<BR>
Dexfenfluramine and MDMA, on the other hand, markedly deplete 
<BR>
brain serotonin and also produce morphological changes. 
<BR>
Collectively, these results lend support to the concept that 
<BR>
all compounds acting on brain serotonin systems, whether 
<BR>
capable of producing serotonin depletion or not, could 
<BR>
produce similar effects on the morphology of cerebral 
<BR>
serotonin systems.
