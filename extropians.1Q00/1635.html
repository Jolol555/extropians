Now that we can clearly see how to solve *all* the problems of the world, 
<BR>
there is absolutely no excuse for hypnotizing ourselves into believing it 
<BR>
doesn't hurt.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I didn't realize we were at that point yet!  Even if we can envision the 
<BR>
solutions it will be the implementation that is so hard and near-impossible. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing that will be so sad is that even if the singularity comes and 
<BR>
brings in a golden age, many will not have made it due to bad health, 
<BR>
accident or being born in the wrong part of the world (early death due to 
<BR>
many causes) or at too early a time.
<BR>
<P>As Max More said awhile back, he may not make it himself.  A number of the 
<BR>
people on this list may not make it via cryonics or life extension to see 
<BR>
the post-singularity world.
<BR>
<P>And life does at times really hurt, for some people much more then others.  
<BR>
Unfairness in life being something that really bothers me.  Facing the pain 
<BR>
and challenges of life or &quot;leaning into the
<BR>
pain&quot; as some call it is not something to yell, &quot;yay!&quot; about but I want to 
<BR>
believe that there are rewards for dealing with the unfairness and pain of 
<BR>
life in as positive a manner as possible.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
