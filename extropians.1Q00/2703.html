Abstract
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dietary polyethylene-glycol (PEG) 8000, a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;nonfermented polymer laxative, strongly suppresses
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;azoxymethane-induced aberrant crypt foci (ACF) in the colon of rats, as shown
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in a previous study (D. E. Corpet et al., Carcinogenesis (Lond.), 20:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;915-918, 1999). In the present study, we tested the effect of PEG
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;administered during either initiation or postinitiation, the dose-response
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;effect of PEG, the regressive effect of PEG on established ACF, and the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;preventive effect of PEG on colon cancers in rats. The general design was to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;initiate carcinogenesis in F344 rats by a single injection of azoxymethane
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;(20 mg/kg) and to randomize the animals 7 days later to AIN-76 diets
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;containing 5% PEG or no PEG (control). At termination, ACF and tumors were
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;scored blindly by a single observer. The administration of 5% PEG for 32 days
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to groups of 10 female rats in either food or drinking water reduced the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;number of ACF by a factor of 8 (P = 0.0002) and reduced the number of large
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;ACF by a factor of 20-30 (P = 0.002). No protection was afforded when PEG was
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;given only during the initiation phase. Diets containing 0%, 0.5%, 2%, or 5%
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;PEG fed for 35 days to four groups of male rats inhibited ACF in a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;dose-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.0001). The administration of a 5% PEG diet for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;41 days, starting 42 days after carcinogen injection, led to a 73% decrease
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in the number of ACF (P &lt; 0.0001). Dietary PEG thus caused the regression of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;established ACF. Macroscopic tumors were evaluated by histology in rats that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;had been fed a high-fat diet containing cooked casein to promote tumor growth
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for 81 days. In this accelerated model of carcinogenesis, dietary PEG
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;suppressed the occurrence of colon adenomas and carcinomas: the incidence of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tumors decreased from 70% to 10% (P = 0.005); and the multiplicity decreased
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from 2.1 to 0.1 tumor(s)/rat (P = 0.003). No cancer was detected in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;PEG-fed rats. Taken together, these results suggest that PEG could be a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;potent anticancer agent in the postinitiation phase of carcinogenesis.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because PEG is a substance that is generally recognized as safe (GRAS list,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Food and Drug Administration), its cancer-preventive features could be tested
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in humans.
