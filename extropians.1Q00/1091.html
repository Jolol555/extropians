&nbsp;Clint, I would bet that you'd have one hell of a time being as logically 
<BR>
&nbsp;detached as you appear to be, if you had the gut-wrenching episode of 
<BR>
&nbsp;watching a person you love, die a slow, very painful death.  Except for 
<BR>
one's 
<BR>
&nbsp;own thoughts near their own death, holding the hand of someone who has just 
<BR>
&nbsp;passed away make you start wondering about the question of a soul, and that 
<BR>
&nbsp;the 'dearly departed' may still, hopefully in some form, be perhaps alive 
<BR>
and 
<BR>
&nbsp;well.  Including in our thoughts the possibility of a soul, substantially 
<BR>
&nbsp;mitigates the tremendous emotional and psychic pain we 'mere humans' have 
<BR>
&nbsp;after the death of a  close friend, relative, or child.
<BR>

&nbsp;Clint, we are not unemotional robots, where every facet of our day-by-day 
<BR>
&nbsp;existence must or even should be based on logical constructs.  Being an 
<BR>
&nbsp;analytical computer 'in the flesh' makes for a better computational 
<BR>
scientist 
<BR>
&nbsp;or mathematician, not necessarily a better human.  In the same venue, 
<BR>
whether 
<BR>
&nbsp;one is an atheist, or a theist, or whether we are or are not merely a 
<BR>
&nbsp;'complex arrangement of physical properties and their effects' is probably 
<BR>
the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;least important thing in the world. But, how we relate to others, family or 
<BR>
&nbsp;friends, on an emotional level, is perhaps one of the most important 
<BR>
&nbsp;behaviors we can have.&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>It's very interesting to me that this very key closing phrase of this letter 
<BR>
was completely ignored. I appreciate your sensitivity. 
<BR>
There is a process that allows people to get a kind of wisdom. You cannot 
<BR>
convince people of it. I will repeat that:

<BR>
I noted a tendency in some athiests (heheh) , to jump to conclusions and 
<BR>
respond angrily and judgementally. I compared this to the pious.
<BR>
<P>I was raised by an atheist and an agnostic so I never had to &quot;overthrow&quot; a 
<BR>
religious system, I have never believed in God. perhaps that is why I need 
<BR>
not decry my positions, or be vehement. Certain religions are incredibly 
<BR>
destructive. Those who come from severely restrictive oppressive religious 
<BR>
cultures can be excused for having more animosity towards it...  maybe it's 
<BR>
neccessary to overcome that early programming.
