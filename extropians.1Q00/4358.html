<EM>&gt; &gt; The whole problem with taxing barter exchanges is the presumption that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government has a right to part of your property, which is clearly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; unconstitutional. The government has a right to tax transactions
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; involving money because the money is a security instrument of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ROFL!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael, if constitutionality actually mattered most of the government would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be shut down tomorrow.  The sad fact is that the government disagrees with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your position, and the courts will back them up. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, they don't. Taxing a barter exchange would be classified as a
<BR>
direct tax, which the Supreme Court has continually said is
<BR>
unconstitutional for the federal government to tax. The states can
<BR>
impose direct taxes. The feds can only impose indirect taxes, like
<BR>
tariffs, excises, and duties. The Income Tax is actually an income duty,
<BR>
but legally it is only required to be paid by residents of federal
<BR>
property and resident aliens, everyone else who resides in the 50 states
<BR>
pays the income tax voluntarily. Those who point to the 16th Amendment
<BR>
don't know or understand what that Amendment actually did. What it did
<BR>
was establish that an income tax is an indirect tax, and that it can
<BR>
only be mandated for certain types of income and on certain types of
<BR>
people.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If the IRS decides to tax
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; downloaded MP3 files as income at the retail price of the equivalent CDs,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they can, and no amount of argument on your part will convince either them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or the courts not to let it happen.  So, your only protection is your skill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; at not getting caught - whether money ever changed hands is entirely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrelevant to the issue.
</EM><BR>
<P>Taxing property is a direct tax and is only permissible by the states,
<BR>
not by the federal government. Since the case can be made that MP3 files
<BR>
offer nowhere near the quality of CD technology, they are not the same
<BR>
thing, so applying CD sales taxes to MP3 downloads is not reasonable.
<BR>
<P>I understand that most people here live in jurisdictions where they have
<BR>
ceded most of their 9th amendment rights to their state and local
<BR>
governments, so you feel like little more than serfs, but there is a
<BR>
distinct difference in the types of taxes that the states can levy
<BR>
versus what the feds can levy.
