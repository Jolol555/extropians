<EM>&gt; It seems that the rate of development of technology would necessarily be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited by the rate at which the new technology can be assimilated by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; users, assuming that the users are directing the development.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, think of the headaches of a high-tech startup.  First write a plan,
<BR>
then convince people to provide money, then hire people, then do the work...
<BR>
<P>If an entrepreneur has been successful in the past, the first two
<BR>
steps get dramatically shorter.  The recent round of high-tech startups
<BR>
is occuring much faster because (a) there is so much cash floating around
<BR>
that less &quot;selling&quot; has to be done; and (b) we are moving into industries
<BR>
where less and less infrastructure has to be built to get the thing going.
<BR>
If the startup is successful, then this becomes a self-perpetuating process.
<BR>
<P>So long as the industries are focusing on overcoming customer
<BR>
resistance (esp. rates of learning limitations), things will get faster
<BR>
and faster.  Witness the fact that they are now *giving away* lots
<BR>
of high tech stuff (cell phones, ISP access, etc.).  That removes one
<BR>
of the big barriers to marketing things at faster and faster rates.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So long as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; humans are in charge, it seems that they would not allow technology to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; advance any faster than they wish it to advance.
</EM><BR>
<P>If it were &quot;demand-pull&quot; that would be the case, but it seems alot more
<BR>
like its &quot;create-push&quot;.  I'm don't go shopping for a car based on whether
<BR>
it has a GPS system in it, but in another 5 years I doubt you will see
<BR>
a vehicle without one.  Will I use the technology?  Hard to say.  Look
<BR>
at all the features in MS-Word that I don't use but I still buy the
<BR>
software because the it does the job I need it for fairly well.
<BR>
<P>It is going from whether *all* humans can absorb the technology to the
<BR>
point where is there *any* human that will use the technology.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And if humans were not in charge, and technology were advancing on its own,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as for example by the actions of intelligent robots, it seems that humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would seek to isolate themselves from the new technology so long as it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is too advanced for them to use or to benefit from it.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, now you are talking pseudo-ludditism (Quakers, etc.).  As Robin
<BR>
and others have pointed out, those who are first to grok the technology
<BR>
and use it to accelerate their growth rates will have a substantial
<BR>
advantage over those who don't.  Whether or not they keep the stay-behinds
<BR>
as pets or antiques remains an unresolved question.
