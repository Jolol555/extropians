<EM>&gt;     Your point is well taken;  it's obviously not possible to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determine these things with the kind of exactness you might find in a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; white rat experiment.  I was more concerned with Daniel's  &quot;studies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confirm&quot; statements than with arguing about health per  se.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually, what I wrote regarding two studies was that they &quot;seemed to
<BR>
confirm...&quot;  Note the qualification.  I'm usually very careful about this
<BR>
stuff.  If someone is going to accuse me of sloppy thinking, please don't
<BR>
back it up with sloppy quoting.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mentioned in a later post, I take vitamins myself based on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inexact knowledge we do have.  But I tend to bristle when someone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; starts slinging around &quot;scientific studies&quot; as evidence for a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; viewpoint they've already settled on.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have not settled on this and modify my regimen as I learn more.  I don't
<BR>
do any radical changes mainly because I don't want to be caught in some fad
<BR>
that doesn't work.:)  (Also, I'm not rich, so I can't afford to be taking
<BR>
every last supplement that hits the market.:)  As I've mentioned in several
<BR>
posts ago, I also don't want to be caught in some pill-popping religion.
<BR>
The goal is a long, healthy, happy life -- not obesience before some theory
<BR>
or other.
<BR>
<P>I also &quot;bristle&quot; when someone (who has not participated in this discussion
<BR>
since:) disses something by claiming that &quot;there has not been a single study
<BR>
I'm aware of to show that popping vitamin pills has any positive health
<BR>
benefit at all.&quot;  (Lee Daniel Crocker on 2000/2/15)  This wasn't even
<BR>
against life extension claims, but against health claims in general, which,
<BR>
to me, is painting with a broading brush than even John (I hope!) would care
<BR>
to.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In real life we always need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; base our decisions on partial knowledge and understanding.  Confusing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this with scientific verification helps no one.  Of course, in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economics things may be different ;-)
</EM><BR>
<P>I think all knowledge, including scientific knowledge, exists in specifiable
<BR>
contexts.  That a study might be imperfect does not invalidate it.  It only
<BR>
means we must be aware of what we can really base on any given experiment,
<BR>
observation, anecdote, etc.
<BR>
<P>Long lives to all, especially my critics!:)
