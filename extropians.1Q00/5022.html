<P><EM>&gt;A good move, otherwise it would have been an even bigger white elephant than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the space shuttle. It just makes no economic sense. The thing's claim to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fame is its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ability to turn common U238 into Plutonium in a very big way, but there's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;already a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;glut of Plutonium in the world.
</EM><BR>
<P>Plutonium in the IFR would never leave the containment. The design had a 
<BR>
sealed, built in fuel reprocessing plant, and used the Pu to fuel the 
<BR>
reactor. High level wastes were blanketed around the reactor to absorb 
<BR>
stray neutrons, thereby speeding their decay.
<BR>
<P>World stocks of Pu are a rich source of power. They are not a liability 
<BR>
unless they are NOT burned in power plants.
<BR>
<P>The problem here in the US is that the anti-nuke crowd refuses to allow 
<BR>
reprocessing, since that would require transporting of radioactive 
<BR>
material. The safety record of fuel and high level waste transport is very, 
<BR>
very good. If our govt. had any sense, we would be burning Pu in all our 
<BR>
compatible plants today.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What I like is fusion power, in particular the reaction between non
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;radioactive deuterium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;(Hydrogen 2) and non radioactive Helium 3, this produces non radioactive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Helium 4,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   an easily controlled proton, 18.3 mev of energy, and most important of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;all, no neutron
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to make other things radioactive. Unfortunately there's not much Helium 3
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;on Earth and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;you need a higher temperature and pressure to achieve the reaction than the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;deuterium
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;tritium reaction most are talking about.
</EM><BR>
<P>How I yearn for the day ANY kind of useful (non - bomb) fusion becomes 
<BR>
available.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, it's always ten years in the future. The IFR could have been 
<BR>
running commercially for the last 5 years without the veto by Klinton.
