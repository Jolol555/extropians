<P>
Arla,
<BR>
<P>The attachment called &quot;The lowest form of human life&quot; reminds me of
<BR>
something I wrote once. I read that when Edward Jenner introduced
<BR>
vaccination to prevent smallpox,  he was condemned from the pulpits of
<BR>
Christendom for interfering with the will of God. I was angry about that for
<BR>
some time, feelings similar to my response to the jackasses quoted in this
<BR>
attachment. Finally I sat down to write what I felt and this poem wrote
<BR>
itself:
<BR>
<P>An Open Letter to Prometheus
<BR>
<P>We both know
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and the snake got a raw deal.
<BR>
Contrary to common opinion,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zeus and Yahweh are not responsible:
<BR>
We both know
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those two don't exist,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;except in the fear of the snivelers.
<BR>
They did it-
<BR>
The worst in man,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cowards,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Condemned the best:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You and the Snake.
<BR>
Your gift,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fire of Thought,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They call Hubris-Pride
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-and pretend it's evil.
<BR>
His gift,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Fruit of the Tree
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of Knowledge of Good and Evil,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They call sin-
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Original Sin.
<BR>
They say:
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's Unnatural.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;That's Tampering with Nature.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It's the Will of God.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Suffering is Noble.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Have Faith.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Be Humble.&quot;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Accept.&quot;
<BR>
They won't admit that You Are Man
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they're afraid
<BR>
to become God.
<BR>
<P><P>That last line seems to generate more heat than light so I've sometimes used
<BR>
the alternate ending:
<BR>
<P>To stand on their feet,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And use their Minds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And use their Hands.
<BR>
<P>But I like the original ending. It has more punch.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don Klemencic

Subject:	[Fwd: The lowest form of human life]threshold value to sustain a
<BR>
quality adjusted year of life
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&lt;&lt; Message: The lowest form of human life (1.82 KB) &gt;&gt; Ditto.
<BR>
<P>The thinking which has driven digital technology to satisfy  moore's law
<BR>
to create  &quot;faster, better, cheaper&quot; for the consumer  has created a
<BR>
massive consolidation of economic resources based upon
<BR>
physical assets which are essentially nearly worthless in a traditional
<BR>
economic sense.
<BR>
<P>Medicine is still based upon assumptions that disease and death are
<BR>
inevitable and rewards to the economic engine are to be based upon
<BR>
keeping societal  medical costs to less than  $830,000 per first world
<BR>
citizen.  A  paridigm shift which would  give medical economists and
<BR>
ethicists  some grief would  be  a public mandated  requirement  to
<BR>
apply moore's law to medical economics.
<BR>
<P>To be both cost effective and ethical , medicine has to fully
<BR>
commercialize medical knowledge in extremely short time slices.
<BR>
Developments which had product life cycles  starting with extremely
<BR>
expensive procedures or medical products  used by a handful and ending
<BR>
in cheap procedures/products utilized by anyone with even marginal
<BR>
resources and a desire to access a procedure/product  traditionally took
<BR>
decades to reach full worldwide commercialization.   Digital technology
<BR>
is the key to  making moore's law applicable to medicine.
<BR>
<P>The cost to generate the code underlying a windows 2000 program is only
<BR>
justified if there are a hundred million users in less than 3 years
<BR>
willing to fork out $100 each for the end product.  The key to making
<BR>
medical economics ethical is to deliver drugs, procedures similarly.
<BR>
Doctors are to be advisors and the patient the  ones to satisfy.
<BR>
<P>The need to mate the trillion in internet market capitalization with a
<BR>
trillion in real world business
<BR>
(ex the AOL -Time Warner merger) might just be the  spark to start a
<BR>
medical economics and ethics paridigm shift.
<BR>
<P>Anyway it's 3 AM here so I will have to leave these thoughts for another
<BR>
day.
