<EM>&gt; Simply by being there as an open forum for exchange of ideas connected with

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps the link between discussions and tangible results is less direct and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; immediate than you want, but then again maybe the effects of these discussions 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are mostly occurring in a more indirect, not centrally organized and/or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; policed, i.e. in a 'Spontaneous Order' :-) kind of way.

<P>This thread is important.  What is involved are some very subtle details
<BR>
of how the human mind works.  Debate, as discussed and detailed in some
<BR>
previous notes (esp. Joseph's) involves many points.  The problem is that
<BR>
debate is a very linear process.  However, movement from &quot;discussion&quot; into
<BR>
&quot;action&quot; may require a very &quot;parallel&quot; process.  If you look at W. Calvin's
<BR>
analysis of the workings of our minds, the question becomes when the debate
<BR>
produces sufficient (internal) &quot;parallel&quot; agreement that the debate effector
<BR>
(i.e. the mind/body) moves into action.  Given Calvin's perspective, it would
<BR>
be highly difficult to track the influences our debates have on the minds
<BR>
subscribing to the discussions.
<BR>
<P>What is clear (for me) is that we are lacking an integrated forum for
<BR>
summary, condensation and presentation of the parallelism inherent
<BR>
to &quot;debates&quot;.  It isn't until you hash through the arguments, then
<BR>
present them in a condensed (parallel) format that the relative
<BR>
benefits/risks/tradeoffs become clear.  I want to stress strongly,
<BR>
that I think this medium (email distribution) has a limited capacity
<BR>
to solve this problem.  You have to have &quot;editors&quot; willing to do
<BR>
the presentation re-work and collection of commentary that would
<BR>
be required to turn debate into conclusions and potentially action.
<BR>
I cannot stress strongly enough the requirement for a &quot;white-board&quot;
<BR>
analysis of the debates as crucial to generating the parallel
<BR>
perceptions that are required to make the debates really useful.
<BR>
<P>Fundamentally, it requires individuals stepping up to the plate saying
<BR>
&quot;I am willing to be responsible for (or the expert on) discussion in
<BR>
this area&quot; and summarizing the various viewpoints.
<BR>

<BR>
<P>(As a footnote, I would tend to disagree with any tentative conclusions
<BR>
that debate in this forum is &quot;fruitless&quot;.  I know personally in a
<BR>
number of areas it has forced me to refine my thinking.  Given the
<BR>
&quot;tough sell&quot; I am likely to be, that serves as testimony to those
<BR>
contributing to the debate.)
