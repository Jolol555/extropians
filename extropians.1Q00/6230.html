<EM>&gt;From: Dan Fabulich &lt;<A HREF="mailto:daniel.fabulich@yale.edu?Subject=Re:%20Surveilance%20was:%20Transhuman%20fascists?&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000330194223.40288.qmail@hotmail.com&gt;">daniel.fabulich@yale.edu</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Tell me it is *impossible* and I will shut up.  The mere fact that its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; not easy does not make a hill of beans difference to me.  It wasn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; *easy* going to the moon. If it can be done, at some point or another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; somebody will throw enough money and enough programmers at the problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to get it done.  The fact that nobody has done it yet, or that *you*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; don't see a way to do it does not matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Again, I don't think it's impossible.  I think it's hard.  Which means
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that it's easier for the more powerful.
</EM><BR>
<P>OK, its hard.  Agreed.  But so is nearly *everything* that society spends 
<BR>
its time doing.  But that doesn't mean that government is in control of 
<BR>
everything we do.  Creating the internet was hard.  But me and my little 
<BR>
business now benefit just as much from it as the government does.  Building 
<BR>
a highway is hard.  So hard in fact that I've never even tried it.  But I 
<BR>
use one everyday, virtually *free* of charge.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; But even a hugely massive problem becomes manageable when tasks are 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;broken
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; up and distributed.  The bigger the problem, the more hardware and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;software
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you throw at it.  If you have every machine on the planet working to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; it there is no such thing yet as an unbreakable code.  You have to admit
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; that at *some* level of computational power the problem can be solved.  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; think you'll also have to admit that at some point in the future that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;level
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of computation will be reached.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sure.  And it will be more accessible to the powerful than the weak.
</EM><BR>
<P>As explained above, the &quot;powerful&quot; might be needed to create the system.  
<BR>
That does not however mean that they will be the sole beneficiaries of it.
<BR>
<P><P>-Zero
<BR>
<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
