</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the human genome one or two years before the government project, and at

<EM>&gt; a cost that is a small fraction of what the government has spent. I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say thats beating the pants off of them.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have spent the last 8 years of my life actively following the HGP
<BR>
(because I *wanted* the genes responsible for aging).  I also spent
<BR>
a great deal of my own money attempting to build DNA sequencers based on
<BR>
the government-funded university research that indicated the sequencing
<BR>
could be done much faster.  (Because at that time it looked like Perkin
<BR>
Elmer wasn't trying to commercialize the research because it would have
<BR>
undercut the market for their then pokey sequencing machines (ABI 373s)).
<BR>
I've attended either 3 or 4 of the TIGR Genome conferences that are held
<BR>
each year in Sept.  My reading day-to-day reading list includes Science,
<BR>
Nature, Nature Biotechnology, Biotechnology, the DOE Genome Newsletter,
<BR>
the HUGO newsletter, and a host of similar sources not worth boring you with.
<BR>
<P>I humbly suggest that I am the best informed individual on this list to
<BR>
comment on this topic.
<BR>
<P>The government project is taking 10 years because (a) when they started
<BR>
they didn't have the technology to do it at the projected cost.  They
<BR>
had to fund the research to develop the technology first; (b) the
<BR>
people managing the project were biologists who thought that you had
<BR>
to produce a very accurate map before you could do the sequencing;
<BR>
(c) nobody knew that computer power would advance sufficiently
<BR>
to allow you to assemble a ~10 million piece jigsaw puzzle.
<BR>
<P>The only reason that PE/Celera is able to do this is that they recognized
<BR>
the technology shifts that occurred a bit quicker than everyone else.
<BR>
They also had on their team a very very bright mathematician who showed
<BR>
that it really could be done.  [Side note -- this show the importance
<BR>
of multidiciplinary teams!]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The human genome is something that I do agree all human beings share an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equal ownership in. The government apparently has no intention to give
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Venter any patent rights at all, and is pretty pissed that he's making
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; them look like idiots.
</EM><BR>
<P>If Celera or the other companies meet the patent criteria, I fully
<BR>
expect they will get patents.  It will be up to the courts to determine
<BR>
how &quot;widely&quot; claims may be interpreted.  People within the Govt (and
<BR>
outside of it) are annoyed, because the fundamental issue (regarding
<BR>
patents) is whether or not any &quot;invention&quot; has taken place.  If
<BR>
Celera (or before them TIGR) had wanted to patent a process for
<BR>
high throughput genome sequencing and assembly you wouldn't have
<BR>
heard a complaint from anyone (except those who might have thought
<BR>
that the approach was &quot;obvious&quot;).  That was the &quot;inventive&quot; part
<BR>
of this whole effort.  Sequencing the genome is just grunt work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Considering that any government information that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; isn't classified for defense purposes is required to be made available
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to everyone freely, the government is breaking its own law by refusing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to provide Venter (who is one of us) with any of their own results.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmm, do you have a reference for this claim?  If I look at
<BR>
&nbsp;<A HREF="ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/H_sapiens/">ftp://ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/genomes/H_sapiens/</A>
<BR>
there are a huge number of files that were updated as recently
<BR>
as a week ago.  If they are trying to seal the most recent
<BR>
information to prevent Celera from finishing early, I would
<BR>
probably applaud the effort.  If you view the genome as &quot;public&quot;
<BR>
property (say like old growth timber on public lands), then private
<BR>
companies should have to pay for the right to access this resource.
<BR>
The &quot;public&quot; on the other hand is free to go explore this resource
<BR>
so long as the leave it behind for others to do the same.  In cases
<BR>
where someone develops a public resource (e.g. ski areas) there are
<BR>
some pretty complex regulations about their rights and obligations.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Not only that, but they are trying to get Venter to share his results
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; without any sort of propreitary use agreement. When he balked at this,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they got all huffy and started making him look like the bad guy.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From the perspective of some individuals, he has been the bad guy
</EM><BR>
from day one.  I would argue anyone attempting to claim a public
<BR>
resources for his own *is* a bad guy.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So far as I know, all Venter is interested in doing with the genome
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information is to package it and sell it to other researchers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Yes, and when there is value added in that information or how it is
<BR>
presented, then companies will gladly pay for it.  This has been true
<BR>
with HGS, Incyte, and presumably in the future, Celera.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fact that he added value to the information by actually sequencing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it is the value and investment he has a right to a return on.
</EM><BR>
I'm not sure whether this is a good analogy -- Did Columbus &quot;add value&quot;
<BR>
to America by discovering it?  Certainly *not* to the people who
<BR>
possessed it at the time.  If PE had been selling the sequencing
<BR>
machines one for Celera, one for the Gvmnt, (given that the machines
<BR>
are built based on the technology derived from the Gvmnt investment),
<BR>
then I would grant a level playing field.  However, what Celera has had
<BR>
in this case is an unfair monopoly on an essential resource.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; He has no problem with other companies doing their own sequencing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and selling that information.  What he has a problem with is other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; companies getting for free his results that the government wants him
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to provide to them.  As far as I am concerned, he is totally justified.
</EM><BR>
<P>This would be correct.  If Incyte combined the Celera
<BR>
data with their database, they could have a substantial leg up
<BR>
on Celera.  It *is not* in Celera's interest to see their data
<BR>
become public.  If the government cannot sufficiently &quot;hide&quot;
<BR>
the Celera data from the public, then Celera is justified in
<BR>
keeping it private.
<BR>
<P>To understand this debate, you need to understand the process involved.
<BR>
The goverment researchers want a really *accurate* sequence (1 error in
<BR>
10,000 bases or even much lower).  Celera wants an accurate sequence too
<BR>
(because it makes for good marketing).  To get a really accurate sequence you
<BR>
have to oversample (to the tune of 9-11x coverage (30 billion+ bases)).
<BR>
Both groups can get an accurate sequence if they spend the required $$$.
<BR>
If on the other hand, one group can get the other to hand over its data,
<BR>
when each have 4x coverage, then the group that puts it together can
<BR>
announce the &quot;finished&quot; human genome and get a public relations &quot;win&quot;.
<BR>
In reality its smoke &amp; mirrors.
<BR>
<P>What is interesting is the fact that Incyte most likely *has* a relatively
<BR>
complete database of the expressed genes already and the government isn't
<BR>
talking with them.  So the &quot;fight&quot; is over information that I would view
<BR>
is of very marginal value.  For Celera to get any patents, they would
<BR>
have to discover genes and figure out a patenting strategy that
<BR>
Incyte has somehow missed.
<BR>
<P>At issue isn't really who has the information (both groups *will* have
<BR>
a rough sequence).  At issue is who has the &quot;correct&quot; sequence.  And even
<BR>
that is inaccurate because the variation from individual to individual
<BR>
means that there is no &quot;correct&quot; sequence.  So what is really at stake
<BR>
is the claim that one group has the &quot;best&quot; consensus sequence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; He is not patenting innovative medicine, or proteomic interventions,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or even _functional_ variants on the genome.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; he isnt trying to patent anything that I have heard.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Instead, he has filed patents on thousands of _fragments_ of code. Raw code.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since when?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have seen a claim in print, that Celera has filed over 7000 patents.
<BR>
The stock took off like a rocket when that information became public,
<BR>
so you could probably find it by looking at the stock price changes
<BR>
and examining public news archives.
<BR>
<P>Now, the debate is pretty *POINTLESS* because a patent application
<BR>
isn't worth squat if the patent office doesn't grant it (as happened
<BR>
with Incyte).  Even a granted patent may not be worth squat if
<BR>
the &quot;claims&quot; aren't for something of value.  You patent a gene, but
<BR>
I later patent that gene for something really *useful* that you
<BR>
didn't claim and when the lawyers sit down to negotiate royalties,
<BR>
the guy with the best use gets the biggest chunk of the pie.
<BR>
