<EM>&gt; From: Spike Jones &lt;<A HREF="mailto:spike66@ibm.net?Subject=Re:%20Cooling%20technique%20for%20Jupiter%20brains&In-Reply-To=&lt;38A5042B.1DB9484B@ibm.net&gt;">spike66@ibm.net</A>&gt; Wed, 09 Feb 2000:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;energy and a big ball of stuff starts to form in the center.  Or does
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;it?  What is the shape of the gravitational field in that tunnel?
</EM><BR>
<P>Jeff's right.  The G field increases linearly along the axis of the tunnel
<BR>
and and is unchanging in any direction away from the axis.  So then,
<BR>
the junk tossed inside the tunnel, upon losing kinetic energy, would
<BR>
form a flattened disk, right?  The junk pile would attract itself, and
<BR>
would have a G field axial along the tunnel only.  So the disk would
<BR>
be flattened along the direction of the tunnel until it touched the sides.

<EM>&gt; Hey you know this problem! Fun isn't it?
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja!
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; First of all, regarding the time it takes to fall from one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; end to the other (it takes 42 minutes each way) it doesn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; matter _where_ the ends of the cylinder are located, i.e. where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;yahoo_A&quot; and &quot;yahoo_B&quot; are pitching their trash at each other.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The time to fall from one end to the other (by gravity alone)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is independent of the two places.
</EM><BR>
<P>Ja, assuming of course the tunnel passes thru the center
<BR>
of the nonrotating sphere.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Second of all (and this is even more cool :-), the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; object when it falls has an oscillatory motion (single
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; harmonic motion about the center of the earth).
</EM><BR>
<P>and the time it takes to oscillate one full cycle is equal to the time
<BR>
to orbit around the sphere, assuming the lowest possible orbit
<BR>
around a smooth sphere with no atmosphere.  {8-]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; ==&gt; T = 85 minutes for the full period (from AtoB and return)
</EM><BR>
<P>If you are in a boring meeting and need to derive the mass of the
<BR>
earth, one need only remember the orbit time of 85 minutes, and it
<BR>
can be backed out with only that information.  The lowest satellites
<BR>
take a little longer, since they need to be a couple hundred km above
<BR>
the deck so they dont get dragged down immediately by the atmosphere.
<BR>
<P>There is another way, if you need the earth's mass to only one
<BR>
digit of precision: you know the volume of a sphere is 4/3pi*r^3,
<BR>
but for single digit accuracy, pi~3, so V~4*r^3, and you know
<BR>
that the km was initially proposed as 1/10,000 the distance from
<BR>
the equator to the pole, so the radius of the earth can be calculated
<BR>
to be 10,000/pi*2~6370 km.  Cube that and quadruple it, and the
<BR>
volume of the earth comes out to close enough to 1E12 km^3, and
<BR>
since the density of iron and nickel are in the 8000 kg/m^3 range
<BR>
and granite and other rocky stuff is in the 4000 range, then assume
<BR>
an average density of about 6000 kg/m^3 and you get an earth
<BR>
mass of 6E24 kg, which is quite close enough.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;From that, knowing that a 1 kg mass weighs a force of 9.8 newtons,
</EM><BR>
one can calculate the universal gravitation constant without having
<BR>
any reference material handy, assuming you remember that
<BR>
F=GMm/R^2, since you know F, M, m and R.
<BR>
<P>But I digress.  {8-]
