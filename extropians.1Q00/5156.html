<P><EM>&gt; Earlier this year I made reference to a website which purported to be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; produce power from a presently unknown &quot;law&quot; of physics.  Hydrino's I beleive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it was called.....BlackLight power company.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I beleive Spike set the record straight by saying mentioning that for power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to be derived there must be a differential.  That is....there must be a heat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; source and a heat sink.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I've been thinking about that.  (lotsa time to think driving down the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highway...particularly if  youre allergic to commercial radio).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; All power sources that I'm familar with go from hot to cold.  By that I mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the power source(gasoline, diesel, electric, charcoal, firewood,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; whatever) is concentrated.  Using this concentrated heat source and  some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; type of mechanism a tempetrure differential is produced with the ambient.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My truck has a radiator, electric company generators have cooling towers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; etc. etc.  There must be a tempeture differential for power to be produced.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How about if we go about it backwards?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; How much &quot;Coldth&quot; can be concentrated in a mobile source?  Is a solid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nitrogen brick possible?
</EM><BR>
<P>Sure, any element can be solidified.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Assume it is (or something like it).....could usable amounts of electricity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be developed using &quot;thermocouple technology&quot;?  Or merely by letting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nitrogen boil off and powering &quot;steam&quot; engines?
</EM><BR>
<P>The most efficient thermocouples, as I recall, are in the order of 8-10%
<BR>
efficient, and were developed for use on those space probe nuclear batteries or
<BR>
on the SP-100 nuclear reactor as a secondary generation system. The technology
<BR>
was being bandied around by the NASA technology transfer program a couple years
<BR>
ago.
<BR>
<P>Photovoiltaics are similar to thermocouples, though they are a semi-conductor
<BR>
based device, so they are still different. As you may recall, I posted a couple
<BR>
years ago about a hybrid car test vehicle that Washington State University profs
<BR>
and students built that uses a natural gas furnace surrounded by high efficiency
<BR>
photovoltaics (GAs/GAnt sandwiches, about 34.5% efficient) to generate
<BR>
electricity for the car's motors.
<BR>
<P>Letting the nitrogen boil off might be a good idea, as 'steam' type sterling
<BR>
engines are much cleaner and quieter than normal engines. Using the nitrogen as a
<BR>
cold battery on one end, and, say, a solar powered induction coil on the other
<BR>
end, the sterling engine would work ok, however, what you gain in lack of moving
<BR>
parts and complexity, you lose in efficiency.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In this instance the ambient temp. of the atmosphere would heat the nitrogen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brick causing (hopefully) a useful pressure differential.  The only exhaust
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would be nitrogen....chilly nitrogen...no nitrogen dioxides even...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>You would still need a power plant that distilled nitrogen and bottled it up.
<BR>
That takes power, and the distilling and bottling process drains more from the
<BR>
efficiency conversion.
<BR>
<P>My own preference for a perfect car is a twist on the hybrid vehicles we are now
<BR>
seeing. The drawback with hybrid vehicles is that the one skimpy engine puts a
<BR>
limit on you, it can only operate in a certain range, a battery is not very
<BR>
efficient at converting stored energy, and the inverter also draws off several
<BR>
percent as well. My solution is to utilize micro-turbine technology. Some of you
<BR>
have seen the MIMS projects the US Army is working on, with a 10 watt pocket
<BR>
turbine generator to power infantry field equipment. For a hyrbid vehicle, use
<BR>
little or no battery at all, instead have a bank of 20, 1.5 kW micro turbines
<BR>
generating electricity for the drive motors. As demand changes, start and stop
<BR>
individual turbines in the bank. Thus the user can vary ouput from 1.5 up to 30
<BR>
kW. A larger vehicle would use more turbines in the bank, and since they would be
<BR>
modular units, users could add and subtract turbines to match the individual's
<BR>
taste/budget, and failed turbines could easily be removed and replaced, sending
<BR>
the bad unit off to a refurb depot. If one fails on the road, you aren't dead in
<BR>
the water, either, so there would be less need for tow trucks, fewer ruined
<BR>
vacations, etc.
