Hi all, long term lurker hereby de-lurking....

<EM>&gt;*How do you know which screen to look at?* There are hundreds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;thousands, if not millions of cameras you could be monitoring, any of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which may have a picture of somebody slitting a child's throat.  The only
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;way to tell which one is to LOOK at all of them, requiring a gargantuan
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;amount of processing power/time.  That's where the computation comes in,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and a hell of a lot of it.
</EM><BR>
<P>But given the technology required for universal surveillance, it should be
<BR>
comparatively easy for everyone to have a gizmo strapped to their wrist
<BR>
monitoring vital functions which would trigger an alarm (and nearby cameras)
<BR>
in the event of their demise. Any murderer would be caught &quot;on tape&quot; and
<BR>
police would converge on the location immediately. Even if some kind of slow
<BR>
poison was used, you could simply rewind the video from the victim's own
<BR>
personal camera, find the point when their food was tampered with and again,
<BR>
nail the murderer.
<BR>
<P>Also, I read recently (sorry, no idea where) about software that was being
<BR>
developed (and already functional) to monitor video-surveillance in real
<BR>
time.  The software triggered an alarm when it saw &quot;suspicious&quot; behaviour. I
<BR>
think it was still fairly primitive but I seem to remember it was already
<BR>
capable of recognising the difference between car theft and a normal driver
<BR>
getting into their car. In fact, it could even predict (presumably with a
<BR>
fair few false positives) that some one was likely to commit a crime based
<BR>
on their movements / stance etc.

<EM>&gt; But identifying text is a piece of cake compared to identifying people.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Trying to explain what a person looks like to a computer is, as Eliezer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might say, just one step above trying to explain it to a rock.  Today, we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't have anything which can do this anywhere near as well as a human can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (to the best of my knowledge; this project is hard, but not impossible).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you'd done very much programming you'd see why this is so hard.  All
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the computer knows is a grid of numbers (a grid which, as we happen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know, corresponds to a grid of colors).  Based on that alone, the computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; has to identify what a person looks like.  Notice also that the computer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; can only use simple arithmetic and set theory to process those numbers. So
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want you to imagine a function which uses only arithmetic/logical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; operators, (+, *, =, OR, NOT) and membership relations, (X is a member of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; set Y), takes as its input a grid of numbers, and yields as its output a 1
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if the grid of numbers corresponds to a picture of a person, and a 0
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; otherwise.  Can you see how hard this is?  It's not impossible, obviously,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it's Very difficult.  That's why we still haven't done it thus far.
</EM><BR>
<P>Actually there's a system on trial in some nightclubs in (I think) Holland
<BR>
which automatically compares photos of people who have been banned with
<BR>
incoming patrons and sounds an alarm if it recognises them. Again, this is
<BR>
based on a hazy recollection of a news article but I seem to recall that the
<BR>
system was even quite good at seeing through disguises.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the point is you can already (to some degree) automatically turn
<BR>
video into semantic information and as computing power goes through the roof
<BR>
(as I think most on this list would agree it soon will) this will become
<BR>
more and more easy. At the moment speech-to-text software is also rapidly
<BR>
improving (though still prone to error) but it's already got to the stage
<BR>
where I'd probably dictate a book length piece to my computer rather than
<BR>
type it.
<BR>
<P>Oh well, just my two cents...
