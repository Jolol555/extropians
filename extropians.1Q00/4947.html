<EM>&gt; I understand the instinct to look for cheaters in a social situation,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it seems to me that there's not much I can do about that.  If I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote an AI tomorrow and it proved the Goldbach Conjecture on Thursday,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; someone would still say I was a poseur.  Unless writing an AI is going
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to actually advance the state of the art - which, unaided, would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably take a huge chunk of full-time work, and I can't do that unless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I get paid - then it's just an ego trip.  _Coding a Transhuman AI_ isn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; working code, no, but the people *I'm* interested in can generally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perceive that it's different enough to be worth trying, and that's the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prerequisite for getting far enough to try.
</EM><BR>
<P>Are there people who are knowledgeable about AI, who have worked in the
<BR>
field and attempted to build AI systems, who have given you feedback
<BR>
or evaluations on your ideas?  Is that a direction you have attempted
<BR>
to pursue?
<BR>
<P>If you really think your ideas are good, you should enter the fray and
<BR>
expose them to the sharpest and most experienced minds available.  Have
<BR>
you considered presenting your ideas at an AI conference?  Perhaps that
<BR>
would be a better investment of your time than attending a Singularity
<BR>
conference.  Getting into the academic conference circuit, getting your
<BR>
paper published in the proceedings so it can be cited as something other
<BR>
than a URL, is a good first step in science as it is practiced today.
<BR>
<P>In cryptography, there are thousands of people who make up ciphers but
<BR>
are frustrated because they can't attract the experts' attention to
<BR>
see if they are any good.  But if a cipher gets presented at one of the
<BR>
conferences, the top names are on it like sharks.  I suspect that the
<BR>
same thing would be true in other fields.
<BR>
<P>Hal
<BR>
<P>P.S. and of course there's always comp.ai as a starting point.
