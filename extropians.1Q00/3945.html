The Libyan government has a bad reputation in the west -- for various
<BR>
reasons -- but it's by no means a conventional tyranny. According to
<BR>
the Daily Telegraph, Ghadaffi has just abolished almost the entire
<BR>
central government:

<P><A HREF="http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000111395221259&rtmo=Q0eazkzR&atmo=99999999&pg=/et/00/3/2/wlib02.html">http://www.telegraph.co.uk:80/et?ac=000111395221259&rtmo=Q0eazkzR&atmo=99999999&pg=/et/00/3/2/wlib02.html</A>
<BR>
<P>Interesting quote:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;All is presaged in the three volumes of The Green Book, in which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;he outlines a &quot;final solution to the problem of the instrument of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;governing&quot;. He believes that all political processes inevitably result in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;the victory of an instrument of governing, and the defeat of the people,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;ie, the defeat of genuine democracy&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;He reserves particular scorn for representative democracy since,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;the victory of a candidate with 51 per cent of the votes leads to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dictatorial governing body, since 49 per cent of the electorate is ruled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;by an instrument of governing they did not vote for&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P>I dunno about you, but I for one did a double-take when I read that
<BR>
last paragraph -- because it's one of the most telling, and troubling,
<BR>
criticisms of democracy: a majoritarian tyranny is still a tyranny
<BR>
(as far as those not in the majority are concerned).
<BR>
<P>Whether or not Ghadaffi's prescription, on the basis of this diagnosis,
<BR>
makes sense is an issue I'm not going to comment on. But I've got a
<BR>
feeling that some very interesting ideas are being overshadowed in the
<BR>
western media by the general reputation Libya acquired for sponsoring
<BR>
terrorism in the eighties.
