<EM>&gt; &gt; So really all I'm asking for is the ability to look back at them.  Funny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thing is that these guys who would deny me the right to keep an eye on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; government like that probably think of themselves as libertarians!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I think libertarians would be against the government having untrammeled
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance, and that it can not be said that they would be for or against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;surveillance of the government, although I think that some would be for it 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;method to keep tabs on those wielding power on behalf of the citizenry.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So, until all police and government officials are monitored, any monitoring 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the citizenry is repressive as it is a means of power control.
</EM><BR>
<P>Surprise!  I *completely* agree.  That is why I call for power proportional 
<BR>
transparency.  The amount of surveillance you are subject to would be 
<BR>
proportional to the power you have to effect my life.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;So I think that all police officers then public officials should be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;monitored,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;if anybody, and private citizens should not be monitored.
</EM><BR>
<P>This presumes that the *only* threat to security is the threat from the 
<BR>
state.  Oklahoma City was not blown up by the state.  The Unabomber was not 
<BR>
working for the state.  Yes, the state poses a potential threat, but it is 
<BR>
by no means the *only* potential threat.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I have addressed this post of Zero because he addresssed a term that I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;used,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;libertarian, also, I wanted to clarify some things I had written.  Here's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;something funny, if suddenly today we had transparency to all citizens and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;huge supercomputer correlated everyone, then marijuana, etc. use would 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;be seen as quite higher than it is deemed.
</EM><BR>
<P>In fact it would immediately become public knowledge that the majority of 
<BR>
adults have at least experimented with it, and that a significant percentage 
<BR>
still use it from time to time.  Which would logically spur debate as to the 
<BR>
relative dangers of weed, tobacco and alcohol, which would probably lead to 
<BR>
legalization.
