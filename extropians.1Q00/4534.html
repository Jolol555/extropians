<P><EM>&gt; How do we act differently now, knowing that we could be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  getting videotaped, any where, any time?  Eventually you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  know some yahoo is going to invent a mechanical robofly that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  can carry a camera and microphone into your home, thru the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  AC vent or something.  Would that affect the way we act?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  It is suddenly a privacy advantage to be a nerdy nobody.
</EM><BR>
<P>I know others have pointed to David Brin's book &quot;The Transparent Society&quot; in 
<BR>
this thread and I echo that recommendation.  Brin does a good job of 
<BR>
surveying the arguments for and against ubiquitous surveillance and privacy 
<BR>
in various segments of society and our personal lives.  I THINK I disagree 
<BR>
with some of his conclusions, but I do hand it to him for taking the issues 
<BR>
head-on.  (In particular, I think he doesn't do a good job of distinguishing 
<BR>
the issues that arise from openness in the &quot;real world&quot; and the ability to 
<BR>
maintain &quot;data privacy&quot;: I think one can consistently reach two very 
<BR>
different conclusions about what's good in the two different realms).
<BR>
<P>Brin's book made me think hard about the impact that ubiquitous recording 
<BR>
would have on personal, business and legal ethics.  On the one hand, I think 
<BR>
a consensual society of free individuals governed by law would be unworkable 
<BR>
in a world where one could not CHOOSE to conduct some of one's affairs 
<BR>
without observation, or at least where observation was an infringement of 
<BR>
etiquette, ethics and/or law.  On the other, I was forced to consider just 
<BR>
how much time and money gets spent in legal &quot;swearing matches&quot; about what was 
<BR>
said by whom in a particular meeting or what happened when in some unexpected 
<BR>
event like an accident giving rise to a tort claim.
<BR>
<P>What if the default presumption was that all of one's business affairs would 
<BR>
be recorded by all involved?  What if the default presumption was that the 
<BR>
operation of every piece of equipment in a construction project was being 
<BR>
recorded?  The vast majority of litigation boils down to &quot;who said what&quot; and 
<BR>
&quot;who hit who&quot; type questions.  If the presumption was that things would be 
<BR>
recorded unless the parties to a transaction agreed otherwise, people would 
<BR>
have to offer a damned good reason to switch off their cameras.
<BR>
<P>I can't say I've come to any final conclusions, but I have come to a much 
<BR>
less firm opposition to consensual surveillance.
