<EM>&gt;   the NTSB has been able to explain how wires

<EM>&gt;   outside the tank could ignite vapors inside 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the tank. The NTSB simulated the alleged

<EM>&gt;   ignition by placing an igniter inside a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   mock-up tank, and even then, to get it to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   explode they had to add hydrogen and propane 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   to the Jet A1 fuel! Clearly, the relationship

<EM>&gt;   of the NTSB's test to reality is about zero.

Without expressing an opinion one way or the other re: TWA 800, I will
<BR>
simply comment on the argument regarding the &quot;would have been grounded
<BR>
instantly&quot; statement.
<BR>
<P>Given the problems with the rudder controls on 737's and the thrust
<BR>
reversers on 767's, I think it is safe to say that unless a problem
<BR>
is clearly discovered and poses a very high risk to passengers the
<BR>
NTSB/FAA *do not* ground planes.  The fact that planes have to go
<BR>
through a lengthy approval process and the fact that they by and
<BR>
large do work most of the time means that you would have to meet
<BR>
an extraordinary level of proof for faulting engineering to ground
<BR>
an entire fleet.  If you look at implementations of past &quot;problem&quot;
<BR>
fixes, they occur fairly quietly over periods of weeks or months.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line is this -- if we value human lives at $1M each (which tends
<BR>
to be roughly the current standard), then dropping a plane out of
<BR>
the sky is going to cost relatively little compared to the cost
<BR>
of grounding a significant fraction of the air fleet for any length
<BR>
of time.  So IMO, this part of the argument holds very little water.
