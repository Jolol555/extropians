<EM>&gt; I'm pretty far behind on extropians, but still slogging through it.  For 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those of you who are up-to-date,...
</EM><BR>
<P>Yep, we need our Direct-Brain-Links now damn it.  Then you could
<BR>
just read my mind and know the answer.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last on his list of 10 breakthroughs we need for longevity was Weather 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Control.  Robert, how did that make the list?  Why will that have enough 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effect that it deserves a place on the list right after Nanomedicine?
</EM><BR>
<P>The list is ordered roughly in a combination of time-of-development,
<BR>
degree-of-difficulty and impact-on-longevity.  Weather makes the list
<BR>
because after you have done the best you can with nanomedicine
<BR>
(assuming you haven't uploaded and distributed your brain), then
<BR>
weather (flash floods, lightening, tornados, hurricanes, etc.) is still
<BR>
a big threat.  So to are are planes hitting your home, doomsday comets
<BR>
and maurading brown dwarfs.  Its relatively easy to knock the accident
<BR>
rate down quite a bit through better engineering of people and safety
<BR>
hazards, but getting the last few percent (that get you from 5-10,000
<BR>
year lifespans up to the ~50,000 year lifespans, as quoted in The Last
<BR>
Mortal Generation) is very difficult.  Making the weather play nicely
<BR>
is an important part of that.
<BR>
<P>The developments I anticipate in biotechnology, should give you
<BR>
most of what you need for longevities of hundreds to thousands
<BR>
of years.  In that respect Nanomedicine is an &quot;add-on&quot;.  Nice
<BR>
to have but it doesn't make that much of a difference compared
<BR>
to other things that are nearer term.

<EM>&gt; &gt; The key breakthroughs we need are:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - reduce cancer mortality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;     (looks like we get that with angiogenesis inhibitors)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - general replacement organs (next 10 years or so)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - drugs to inhibit brain damage during strokes/heart attacks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - reversing protein glycosylation damage (drugs undergoing tests now)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - a good understanding of all growth factors (5-10 years)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - understanding the molecular biology of aging (5-15 years)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - understanding the causes for and developing cures for genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;      diseases (10-20 years)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - Safer cars, guns &amp; other hazards (ongoing).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - Nanomedicine (20-30 years)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - Weather control (???) 
</EM><BR>
<P>I should add after weather control --
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - Stopping volcanos
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  - Stopping plate tectonics
