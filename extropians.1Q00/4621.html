<P>Overgeneralization Octavio, perhaps partially correct.  I have struggled
<BR>
to understand depression, and may have a few insights.  One does
<BR>
not see a person writhe in pain while they lie on a featherbed.  If one
<BR>
lies upon a hard bench, or a bed of nails, sure they squirm, but not
<BR>
on a soft bed.
<BR>
<P>For me, life is a wonderfully soft featherbed.  Life is goooood!
<BR>
Except during depression events, at which time it is the cruelest, and
<BR>
at those times I writhe in mental agony, and yet those are by far my most
<BR>
creative times.  I might feel like I cannot do anything, but in fact those
<BR>
times and immediately after are when I do things.  Things happen,
<BR>
things get done, I change, create.  Dont know why that is, but it
<BR>
feels like sand in an hourglass.  As the sand pours down the hill gets
<BR>
taller and steeper.  Every once in a while there is a huge slumping
<BR>
down, the hill changes shape suddenly.  Then it starts building again
<BR>
as a new equilibrium is formed.  spike
