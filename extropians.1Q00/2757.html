<P>You forgot to add the clause &quot;and am located in a territory where the local

legislation and culture considers humans of that age minors&quot;.  In others, that

is not necessarily the case, you know.
<BR>
<P>Length is irrelevant, as technology can always correct length insufficiency.
<BR>
<P>|&gt;And you
<BR>
|&gt; should have
<BR>
|&gt; brought up your own kids to be free (otherwise, why
<BR>
|&gt; the hell 
<BR>
|&gt; did you produce them?). 
<BR>
|I didn't know people produced children; I thought they
<BR>
|gave birth to them.
<BR>
<P>The &quot;giving birth&quot; method, the traditional method, is not necessarily the
<BR>
sole method of offspring production.
<BR>
<P>Let me assure you that the parents actually and definitely _produce_ the
<BR>
offspring from their gametes, even though the phrase &quot;giving birth&quot; might
<BR>
indicate that it somehow just ``happens'' or that the local god visits
<BR>
young brides and makes them pregnant.  If this fact offends you, feel free
<BR>
to ignore it (the fact will not go away, however).
<BR>
<P>[...]
<BR>
|It is pretty much naturally engrained into parents
<BR>
|that they need to protect their children from certain
<BR>
|things, sex being one of them. It is a social thing
<BR>
|more than a natural thing, I think, but one that is
<BR>
|none the less very present. I know; often enough I see
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
<P>YOU ARE IN ERROR.
<BR>
<P>The American obsession with sex appeared very late in history.  There exists
<BR>
no proof of &quot;naturally engrained&quot; parents to protect their children from sex.
<BR>
In fact, the opposite has been mainly the norm throughout history.
<BR>
<P>I suggest you control your historical and scientific sources.
<BR>
<P>**** THOSE UN-INTERESTED IN A RANT WILL WANT TO SKIP TO THE &quot;END OF RANT&quot; TEXT,
<BR>
<P>&lt;RANT&gt;
<BR>
<P>Why should the American obsession with sex define the moral of the world?
<BR>
OK, so you have a nation with weird sexual mores..  Why should *I* care?
<BR>
In *this* country we have sex education for kids in school.  So? Big deal.
<BR>
<P>Should we stop discussing beer so our brethren in Saudi-Arabia, where ethanol
<BR>
is a controlled substance, will not become imprisoned?
<BR>
<P>Should we stop discussing politics so our brethren in random dictatorships,
<BR>
where discussing politics makes you an enemy of the State, will not become
<BR>
imprisoned, tortured, and killed?
<BR>
<P>We have to draw a line somewhere.  I say we should do it here and now.
<BR>
<P>Q: What can we discuss if any sundry sepcial circumstance of some weird local
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;custom and even weirder local laws are taken into account?
<BR>
<P>A: NOTHING RELEVANT.
<BR>
<P>This censorship-related meme would have little significance if it not happened
<BR>
to exists in a nation with a planet-wide military force armed with nuclear
<BR>
weapons, and an extremely well-oiled propaganda apparatus to further its memes.
<BR>
<P>Thus, any weird meme from the U.S. can easily propagate around the planet in
<BR>
no time, up to and including such highlights as The A-Team, Oprah Winfrey,
<BR>
root beer, and marshmallows.
<BR>
<P>Remember various previous weird meme complexes which have swept around:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;o	``We must stop masturbation! It makes you feeble-minded and blind!''
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never has so sadistic machinery been generated by mankind to put
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on and around tender body parts of children to ``save'' them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;o	``We must save our race from bad elements!''
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holocaust in Nazi Germany, naturally.  But also sterilization and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;active euthanasia in lots of countries, incl. Scandinavia and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Australia.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;o	``We must save people from drugs!''
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War on Drugs, naturally.  The resources used to generate the police
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;state could have been used to control real crime (violence, rape,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;murder, roobbings, burglary, etc.).
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;o	``We must stop the heretics!''
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torture, pain, burning at the stake, etc.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;o	``We must save the souls of these poor creatures!''
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torture, pain, burning at the stake, etc.
<BR>
<P>The remedy has always been worse than the ``problem''.  Only time will tell
<BR>
what weirdness come from the ``We must save our kids from sex!'' meme.
<BR>
<P>Hopefully, it will make the meme carriers to stop breeding altogether. !-[
