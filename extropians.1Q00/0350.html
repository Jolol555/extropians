<EM>&gt; I think those people buying more-expensive and lesser-quality ''natural'' 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foods are not primarily misled by the businesses selling them these things, I 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think these consumers are primarily misleading THEMSELVES.  They really want 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these things, they really believe that these things are ''better''.  It is an 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrational belief exactly like religion. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Are you so sure that no organic foods are any more healthy than
<BR>
conventionally grown ones?  Sure enough that you will say that the
<BR>
contrary belief is irrational?  I would think you would have to be an
<BR>
expert on food to be so sure.
<BR>
<P>I know that there is a lot of politics going into government regulations
<BR>
of the food supply.  I don't have that much faith in the USDA and other
<BR>
government agencies that their sole concern is with the quality of foods.
<BR>
<P>Look at all the money the government has spent encouraging milk
<BR>
drinking in adults, or encouraging eating beef, or growing tobacco.
<BR>
This is all due to political pressure from the industries that benefit.
<BR>
Such capturing of regulatory agencies by special interests is a long-
<BR>
observed phenomenon in the economics of government.
<BR>
<P>I'm not very knowledgeable about the food industry so I can't say whether
<BR>
organic food is better than you or not.  But I certainly wouldn't go
<BR>
so far as to say that believers in organics are irrational.  It is very
<BR>
plausible to me that government safety regulations are not designed solely
<BR>
for the benefit of consumers, simply because of how government works.
<BR>
It may well be rational to be more cautious about the food you eat.
