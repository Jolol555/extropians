<P><EM>&gt; Exactly. Although the problem with the Omega illumination is that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; covers not just what you really did, but also all possible variations
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (it is cheaper and possibly only possible to simulate many worlds
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rather than one).

<P>Awww hell Anders!  Now Ill hafta be embarrassed by not only all
<BR>
the stupid things I did and said, but all those I managed to *not*
<BR>
do as well?
<BR>
<P>Heres one for you privacy watchers.  Last week here in Taxifornia
<BR>
a guy got into a fit of road rage, pulled over another driver who had
<BR>
clipped his bumper.  She rolled down the window, he reached in,
<BR>
grabbed her bichon frize and threw it onto the freeway, with predictable
<BR>
results.  Then the lothesome bastard drove off.  The reason I bring
<BR>
this up is that he is about to get caught, and heres how: they knew
<BR>
he had a Ford explorer and Virginia plates.  Today the news says
<BR>
Virginia emailed DMV photos of the owners of every Virginia-licensed
<BR>
black explorer!  Is this not an unprecedented thing?
<BR>
<P>Nextly, transparent world fans and info nudists: I can easily imagine,
<BR>
in my own natural lifetime, being able to sit down at a computer, type
<BR>
in any name and have some future version of the web go out and
<BR>
collect every stupid thing that person ever posted, ever, by searching
<BR>
thru achives, etc.  Does this change the way we post?  spike
