<P><EM>&gt; As usual I am thinking in terms of images:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Architect suggests that Nanotech in architecture will have the effect of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; making buildings extremely temporary. Buildings will spring up overnight
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and disappear just as quickly. Corporate property as we know it will become 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; obsolete as businesses are not conducted from &quot;brick and mortar&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; institutions any more. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Buildings can anything of course.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One line of thinking is they be constructed out of very thin, strong
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surfaces and serve a place for projectionary illusion.  A mixture of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Virtual space and real.
</EM><BR>
<P>This deserves significantly more consideration (given how prone I
<BR>
am to growing &quot;long-term&quot; structures using existing biostructural
<BR>
elements stolen from nature).
<BR>
<P>At issue is *what* is the purpose of a building -- to provide shelter
<BR>
from the elements?  to collect heat in one place?  to localize people?
<BR>
<P>It is clear that nanotech can assemble and disassemble buildings
<BR>
very fast.  You may be limited as to how often you do it (on Earth)
<BR>
due to the heat production limitations.  Generally speaking
<BR>
however self-assembling primitively &quot;intelligent&quot; nanobricks could
<BR>
rapidly build and debuild almost anything you could imagine.
<BR>
<P>True, corporate property becomes much more &quot;software&quot;.
<BR>
<P>The question of virtual &amp; real space depends much on the nature
<BR>
of *what* are the people who &quot;use&quot; the buildings (virtual or real).
<BR>
What would be the point of constructing a real building to host
<BR>
a virtual persona ?!?
<BR>
<P>This raises some interesting economics questions about the
<BR>
discontinuity that occurs in the shift from &quot;real&quot; to &quot;virtual&quot;.
<BR>
Have Robin or others attempted to address this?
