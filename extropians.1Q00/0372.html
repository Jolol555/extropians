<EM>&gt; at looking good after transit, but in the opinion

<EM>&gt; (right or wrong) of many, they are deficient in

<EM>&gt; flavour, texture, etc.
</EM><BR>
<P>The chief example of this was the Calgene tomato that
<BR>
was designed for a very long shelf life.  Though it
<BR>
should have tasted *better* because it could be picked
<BR>
later and last longer than &quot;natural&quot; tomatoes.

<P><EM>&gt; Also GM may make something look good, but this is a

<EM>&gt; separate issues from whether there are harmful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; metabolites.

<P>The two key issues are &quot;toxicity&quot; (primarily from the
<BR>
perspective of carcinogenicity) and allergens (from
<BR>
the perspective of promoting an immune system reaction
<BR>
due to foreign proteins).  A third issue might be
<BR>
antibiotic levels (which have an effect on your
<BR>
biostasis).  A fourth issue might be hormone-mimics
<BR>
which may have an effect on lots of genetic systems
<BR>
(this isn't an issue in GM crops currently, but is
<BR>
an issue with regard to common pesticides and some
<BR>
herbicides as well as other environmental pollutants).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I realsie the same applies to natural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; varieties and cultivars. Somebody suggested that *all*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; foods be labelled with their harmful substances,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; natural or artificial, to allow consumres to choose
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; intelligently. Aye to that!
</EM><BR>
<P>I believe that was moi.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; How about a web site? (If there's not one already).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Michael (hmm.. time for lunch)

<P>The problem is that I don't believe there is even a standard
<BR>
system for &quot;classifying&quot; breeds/strains/genetic variants for
<BR>
the genome sources for foods currently marketed.  (Really, how
<BR>
could you classify it if you couldn't sequence the entire
<BR>
genome to know what it really was?!?)  Given the fact that we
<BR>
don't know what it &quot;is&quot;, attaching the analysis of what it
<BR>
&quot;looks like&quot; to it is problematic currently.  This should be
<BR>
feasible within the next 10 years however.
