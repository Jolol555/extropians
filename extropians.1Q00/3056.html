<P>Anyone read Pat Cadigan's _Synners_ ?  Almost that very scenario was in

that book - a &quot;person&quot; (AI, actually the first AI, having spontaneously
<BR>
arisen out of the net) who was ubiquitous on email networks finally
<BR>
&quot;met&quot; one of the characters in a VR simulation - what gave the AI away
<BR>
was that the VR was just too good - no one (who had any sort of life)
<BR>
would have had the time, patience, or ability to put such a simulation
<BR>
together.  Decent book, didn't get much attention as I recall and hard
<BR>
to find. (the fun bit is this was actually assigned reading in a
<BR>
course I had in grad school...)
