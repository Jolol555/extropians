<EM>&gt; I was enjoy some of L. Ron Hubbard's fiction.  I got a huge kick out of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot; and it was a fast read despite around a thousand pages!
</EM><BR>
<P>That book was good clean fun in the pulp sci-fi tradition.  Not a great book by
<BR>
any stretch...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Because of Travolta and others I developed a vague interest in scientology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until I read sections of a book at my local library that gave an insider's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view on how the organization really operated.  I was shocked.  Needless to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say, scientology leadership, I believe, successfully lobbied Amazon.com to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remove it from their inventory.  The system does seem to help some, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder how?
</EM><BR>
<P>It provides a world view... a rational for why things are the way they are...
<BR>
and humans seem to need that.  As such, it &quot;works&quot; about as good as Christianity
<BR>
or Buddhism and for the exact same reasons.
<BR>
<P>FWIW, I was a staff member of the Church of Scientology of Hawaii for two years
<BR>
in the early '80s. I didn't serve out my three year contract and am now
<BR>
considered a Suppressive Person by the Church.
