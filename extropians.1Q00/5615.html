*I know there is a lot of research just around the bend. You may want to try
<BR>
looking into antiangiogenesis, (keeps tumors from building blood vessels to
<BR>
supply them with nutrients) however, I don't know what phase it is currently
<BR>
in. It may be in the experimental stage, but I haven't been keeping up. I do
<BR>
see however that there are some clinical trials (and contact info for each)
<BR>
listed at this url:
<BR>

<BR>
*You can also do a search dictating the specific type of cancer and type of
<BR>
clinical trial you are looking for within your area at:

<P><P><P><EM>&gt; Hey Everyone
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     My sister has breast cancer and now it's spread to her ribs and
</EM><BR>
possibly
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the spine and the doctor says the clock is really ticking now so we're
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looking for any kind of last hope here some kind of experimental treatment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something.  Does anyone know of ANYTHING that can help us out here?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Something that may offer some hope.  One last Hail Mary.  Any information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be *greatly* appreciated.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     Thank You So Much To Anyone Who Contributes, Eric
