<P><EM>&gt; I like your idea about &quot;untamperable&quot; assembler boxes,

<EM>&gt; but it raises a question for me.  What's to stop a

<EM>&gt; group of people from cranking out almost free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unlicensed potentially dangerous assembler boxes?
</EM><BR>
<P>Probably not much other than a lot of hard work.  It will get
<BR>
into a question of whether or not we have ubiquitous surveilance
<BR>
and moderately intelligent AI agents.  If we do, I suspect it
<BR>
would be much harder to avoid being &quot;spotted&quot; as having a pattern
<BR>
of purchasing that could lead to an unlicensed box.  It raises
<BR>
some interesting issues.  Currently the government would be free
<BR>
to observe the delivery person deposting packages to your doorstep.
<BR>
Given some good optics they can probably read the return
<BR>
address on the package.  An interesting question would inolve
<BR>
whether or not &quot;airborne&quot; monitoring cameras have the right to
<BR>
&quot;hover&quot; outside your door?!?
<BR>
<P>Then of course you could get into the interesting uncharted realm
<BR>
of whether or not your purchases occur in the private space or
<BR>
public space.  [In theory, commercial transactions are regualted
<BR>
in the public space, though current debates about taxing authority
<BR>
bring this into some question.]  If commercial transactions are in
<BR>
the public space, then one could argue that the government should
<BR>
have access to them.  I believe Eric thinks that once the transactions
<BR>
occur in the &quot;encrypted&quot; space, then the government will be locked out.
<BR>
<P>Now, it would be very interesting if individuals moving towards
<BR>
an unlicensed box were contacted, not by say the government, but
<BR>
by a &quot;citizens&quot; board.  Failing to explain yourself adequately to them
<BR>
would allow the government to simply publish your purchasing
<BR>
pattern so your neighbors knew what you were up to.  Say this
<BR>
would allow your neighbors access to a set of reserved &quot;defense&quot;
<BR>
designs and perhaps a pool of public funds reserved for the
<BR>
manufacturing of defense technologies.  I think individuals displaying
<BR>
this behavior pattern would find themselves surrounded by some very
<BR>
strong walls relatively quickly.  (Kind of changes the whole flavor
<BR>
of things when you don't have to imprison someone, but simply build
<BR>
the prison around their property...  Leave the property and you find
<BR>
yourself being monitored by hundreds of sky cams.  If these strategies
<BR>
were developed in advance, then someone wanting to pursue the development
<BR>
of an unlicensed assembler, might have to devote some serious thought
<BR>
to what exactly was the purpose of their &quot;experiment&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The appeal of having something not controlled by &quot;the man&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be too strong to resist for many.
</EM><BR>
<P>True, but you kind of have to look at it like &quot;seat belts&quot;.  Many
<BR>
dislike them, a few would argue that they even sometimes kill people.
<BR>
But the solutions to the objections are to develop belts that stretch,
<BR>
disconnect when submerged in water, other passive restraints, etc. --
<BR>
not to eliminate the requirement that individuals should be protected
<BR>
in situations where they are unable to protect themselves (due to
<BR>
reaction time requirements &amp; forces) that exceed human &quot;norms&quot;).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; And why choose Box A which will only creates from approved templates
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; when you can choose Box B which will create (just about) ANYTHING?
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the AA (almost anything) boxes are probably much cheaper than the
<BR>
E (everything)  boxes for one reason.  Remember, I've argued against things
<BR>
being &quot;free&quot;, you still have matter and energy costs.  If JoSH's papers on
<BR>
manufacturing scaling are any indication, the bulk production of AA boxes
<BR>
would likely make them very very inexpensive.  On the other hand E boxes
<BR>
will probably be much more difficult to obtain or construct.  (Presumably
<BR>
AA boxes will not manufacture parts for E boxes.).
<BR>
<P>You probably also have to look at the question of why people object
<BR>
to goverment and want to circumvent government regulations.  Taxes
<BR>
as we know them probably don't exist.  Environmental &quot;guidelines&quot;
<BR>
probably do make a huge amount of sense and would probably be generally
<BR>
accepted and supported by people.  Why?  Because your survival and
<BR>
personal livelyhood might depend on it.  What would be your productivity
<BR>
and survivability in a completely chaotic environment?  It seems that
<BR>
for people to operate (productively) they have to know the local rules
<BR>
of the game.  So there would always be a large amount of local pressure
<BR>
for defining and maintaining the rules.  If the enclaves idea takes hold
<BR>
you can expect there to be a huge number of rule sets.  It would seem
<BR>
that there should be few barriers to moving between enclaves other than
<BR>
the risks of moving to and operating in different environments.  So
<BR>
there might be an environment where &quot;E&quot; boxes are the norm.  I suspect
<BR>
however that only &quot;ion&quot; streams go into this environment and &quot;bit&quot; streams
<BR>
come out of it.  That type of segregation makes it relatively safe.
<BR>
In my mind most of the motivation to build E boxes would be either
<BR>
&quot;revolt&quot; or &quot;curiosity&quot;.  But if one sees the sense of having only
<BR>
AA boxes in your environment and a crazy environment exists where E
<BR>
boxes are allowed (the wild wild west), then it seems you have removed
<BR>
most of the reasons for building E boxes in an AA enclave.
<BR>
<P>There is probably no &quot;market&quot; for E boxes in an AA environment.
<BR>
People would look on those producing or selling E boxes the same
<BR>
way they look at someone who plays Russian roulette with a gun.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It will only take 1 single unlicensed box to ruin your whole scheme.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not really, mass is mass and the production rates of E and AA boxes
<BR>
are likely to be very similar.  So unless you can make an argument
<BR>
that the ouput of E boxes can trump the output of AA boxes in a
<BR>
serious way (E matter destroys AA matter exponetially, E matter
<BR>
is much cheaper, etc.) I don't see how a few E boxes would be
<BR>
particularly dangerous.  The &quot;gravity&quot; in an AA enclave would be
<BR>
to eliminate them as quickly as possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The entire  create a design, submit it, get it approved and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transmit it will add a lot of cost which will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nonexistant with the unlicensed boxes.
</EM><BR>
<P>*Maybe*.  If its mostly done by unconscious agents, it isn't
<BR>
very expensive.  Humans only probably have to get involved for
<BR>
the really novel stuff.  Since the costs of stuff are *way* below
<BR>
the survival requirements and the &quot;wealth&quot; of individuals is very
<BR>
high (caveats to Robin's scenarios) and since you have this extremely
<BR>
long lifespan, you are probably very interested in preserving the &quot;popular&quot;
<BR>
culture.  You will want to make *sure* design and production is safe.
<BR>
Since there is the E enclave out on Charon if you really want to build
<BR>
E boxes, the society is probably happy to pay for your transport to Charon.
<BR>
<P>I think it comes down to whether you get situations where it is possible
<BR>
to construct more E boxes than AA boxes in a local environment where the
<BR>
outputs can interact with each other in short light-times.  If that
<BR>
situation is avoided, then I think you can maintain the relative level
<BR>
of restrictions &amp; chaos in your local environment.  The import laws
<BR>
are going to be quite interesting however.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Once someone has their unlicensed box build them a dangerous nano-swarm
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to protect them, how are you going to get it away from them?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
Well a few km of highly reflective aluminum in space focusing about 10,000
<BR>
suns of energy on their location is the first thing that comes to mind.
<BR>
If they have the sense to build a highly reflective roof on their E-box
<BR>
plant, then I'd probably be partial to neutralized iron ion bombardment.
<BR>
You have to keep in mind that dismantling planets is a my primary profession.
<BR>
Mopping up inventors that don't agree to the local rule sets is simply
<BR>
a side line.  Messy work, but the pay is probably pretty good.
<BR>
