<EM>&gt;   For those who may not know, 5-HT is serotonin. About
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the degree to which PCP raises serotonin, or 5-HT,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   the journal Neuroreport (1998;9(13):2985-8) states:
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &quot;We here report for the first time that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     systemically administered PCP (5 mg/kg, s.c.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     increases extracellular 5-HT levels in the rat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     medial prefrontal cortex (to 322%) and dorsal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     hippocampus (to 233%).&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>This is very interesting indeed, specially because other 
<BR>
serotonergic drugs don't modify your behavior so drastically
<BR>
LSD can give you a bad trip, but people rarely becomes as
<BR>
aggressive as to kill somebody (although it might happen
<BR>
if the person is too scared)
<BR>
<P>I suppose this is because LSD and other serotonergic drugs
<BR>
work in a different way, the exact mechanism of LSD is not
<BR>
completely known yet, and what MDMA does is to make you
<BR>
release all the serotonin stored in your neurons.
<BR>
<P>I wonder if a person whose behavior is affected by ssri's
<BR>
could be calmed down administering a dose of MDMA to 
<BR>
deplete their serotonin levels, however some ravers use
<BR>
<P>prozac after 6 hours of MDMA ingestion to prevent sero-
<BR>
tonin depletion by blocking the uptake receptors that
<BR>
recapture serotonin and oxidize it with monoamineoxidase
<BR>
<P>so I wonder what kind of effects this combo could possibly 
<BR>
somebody with more knowledge about neuroscience than I 
<BR>
would like to suggest some theories?
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt;PCP interacts with acetylcholene and the opiate system and is a nmda
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;antagonist....it dose not block the reuptake of serotonin....
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's why the effects of prozac and PCP are so different
<BR>
acetylcholene is a neurotransmitter used to control your muscular
<BR>
movement among other things, usually drugs that inhibit it's 
<BR>
production
<BR>
can produce full blown hallucinations comparable to psychoses 
<BR>
(a lot more than those produced by LSD) but they can be used
<BR>
as sleep or motion sickness aids too 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   IAN: Yes, PCP is an NMDA antagonist, however, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   we see in the cited study, behavior modification
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   is linked to PCP's action on 5-HT. Several months
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   ago I contacted Lance Kreplick, M.D., &lt;<A HREF="mailto:LKJK@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Prozac%20&amp;%20Violence%20-%20New%20Study&In-Reply-To=&lt;20000316.22340677@mis.configured.host&gt;">LKJK@aol.com</A>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   who had written a report posted to the web about PCP.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   I asked if PCP is an SSRI. He said: &quot;Yes it is an SSRI.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose then than the dissociative effects PCP has are caused
<BR>
by it's interaction with acetylcholene, and the behavior modifications
<BR>
because of it's action on 5-ht, if it's effects are similar to those
<BR>
of prozac, then not everybody who uses it becomes a violent person.
<BR>
<P>What I still don't understand however, is why PCP causes dissociative
<BR>
effects instead of the hallucinations of traditional acetylcholene 
<BR>
drugs
<BR>
like scopolamine, my hunch is PCP has a mechanism more complex than 
<BR>
this
<BR>
somebody knows it?
