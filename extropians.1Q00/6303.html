<EM>&gt; Clearly, one of the Apollo missions collected this sample, three years

<EM>&gt; after the arrival of the Surveyor.  Anyone know more about this?

<EM>&gt; A terrestrial organism still viable after three years in the heat, cold,

<EM>&gt; radiation, and vacuum of outer space.  I don't know about you, but I'm

<P><P>A camera was removed from the Surveyor and returned to Earth in a lunar
<BR>
sample box. As Henry Spencer pointed out on sci.space.policy not long
<BR>
ago, bacteria were found within insulating foam between two circuit
<BR>
boards, deep inside the camera. (More precisely, it was a sample of the
<BR>
foam, clipped out through a hole in one of the boards, which tested
<BR>
positive in culture.) 
<BR>
<P>In that location, the bacteria (probably spores) were protected from
<BR>
solar UV and x-rays.  Yes, it was in vacuum, but the main effect of that
<BR>
is that it dries things out.  Bacteria survive drying pretty well.

Bacteria exposed to sunlight in space would be killed in minutes if not
<BR>
seconds. UV is nasty stuff, particularly under 200 nm.
