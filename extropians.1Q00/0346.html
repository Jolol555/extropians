<P>I think those people buying more-expensive and lesser-quality ''natural'' 
<BR>
foods are not primarily misled by the businesses selling them these things, I 
<BR>
think these consumers are primarily misleading THEMSELVES.  They really want 
<BR>
these things, they really believe that these things are ''better''.  It is an 
<BR>
irrational belief exactly like religion. 
<BR>
<P>This customer demand is a force impelling farmers and businesses (who, I 
<BR>
suspect, themselves do *not* feel very sanguine about how ''natural'' or GM 
<BR>
their products are) into selling also these things like ''natural'' foods.  If 
<BR>
people want to pay a lot for poor-quality shriveled ''natural'' food with 
<BR>
worms in them, then it is rational behavour for farmers to produce and sell 
<BR>
also these types of food, isn't it ?  Exactly like it probably is rational 
<BR>
behaviour for a publicity-loving actor to become a TV priest and so make money 
<BR>
out of people's passionate and incorrigible desire for stupid mindless 
<BR>
religious bullshit.  
<BR>
<P>It is astounding how entrenched people can be in arbitrary irrational beliefs. 
<BR>
But luckily, our tolerant society leaves these ''natural-food believers'' in 
<BR>
peace; and luckily, the free market allows people to make money out of 
<BR>
providing consumers who feel a desire for these religious nonsense messages 
<BR>
and for unhealthy food with the things they want.  This creates a money 
<BR>
flow from religious self-deluded people to clever open-minded un-prejudiced 
<BR>
people, making the first poorer and the latter richer, thus improving the 
<BR>
survival chances of the unprejudiced people; i.e., this is a mechanism that 
<BR>
does slowly [and 'humanely' :-):-)] dampen down the strength of the entrenched 
<BR>
irrational-belief part and strenghtens the open-minded part of the population, 
<BR>
i.e., a mechanism that increases extropy.  The clever people making money out 
<BR>
of it probably do not fall for irrational sloppy religious stuff themselves, 
<BR>
and therefore probably themselves do not eat bug-ridden ''natural'' tomatos 
<BR>
but eat GM tomatos instead. 
<BR>
<P>Let those who want to buy expensive ''natural'' foods expend a lot of money to 
<BR>
buy these things; as demonstrated in other recent mails on this list on this 
<BR>
subject, people religiously believing in ''natural'' foods are NOT scared off 
<BR>
by high prices of their preferred foods, on the contrary, it is a martyr 
<BR>
effect only causing them to feel better about themselves (''look how much I 
<BR>
can afford to spend on shriveled rotten worm-eaten apples !'').  But all of 
<BR>
this can only benefit the people who do *not* believe so strongly in 
<BR>
''natural'' foods (and who can do the mental trick of not getting worked up 
<BR>
over the stupidness and irrationalities in other people).
