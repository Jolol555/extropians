<EM>&gt; If you want to be really theoretical, I've always been partial to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; constitutional design.  You can easily come up with all kinds of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrangements that are radically different from anything that is actually
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being used, and its fun to try to figure out how to solve all the problems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that have surfaced since the more prominent constitutions were enacted.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, if you really want an interesting topic, take one of the most
<BR>
recently written constitutions (the Russian Constitution), and compare
<BR>
it to the U.S. constitution (over 200 years old).  The interesting
<BR>
thing is that I believe the Russian constitution is a *huge* document.
<BR>
Why did they have to create such a big constitution when they have a fine
<BR>
example of one that seems to work?  You might want to focus on just
<BR>
issue involving protections of civil/personal rights.
<BR>
<P>Another possibility is what government responses will be to the
<BR>
migration of their populations to the first countries to allow
<BR>
access to &quot;almost anything&quot; machines.  Related to that is
<BR>
what does a country do when people stop working for a living
<BR>
(no income taxes), and don't buy anything (no VAT taxes)?
<BR>
<P>And yet a final interesting topic would be whether or not societies
<BR>
will mandate genetic engineering when it becomes feasible to
<BR>
&quot;pacify&quot; criminals or &quot;improve&quot; the intelligence of the below average?
<BR>
The first country that mandates &quot;peaceful&quot; &quot;smart&quot; people is going
<BR>
to have a huge competitive advantage.
