Subject: will the government allow the public direct access to nanotech??
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;To have a world of mature nanotech with nanoassemblers in every home  is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dream of mine.  But I wonder if the government would allow the public
</EM><BR>
direct
<BR>
<EM>&gt;access to nano assemblers?  In the cause of preventing terrorism as well as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;accidents I could see the governments of the world only allowing direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;access to nano to government and corporate entities.  The ulterior motive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be to maintain their strong control over society.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Or would capitalism and corporate greed be the reason for a nanoassembler
</EM><BR>
in
<BR>
<EM>&gt;every home?  And even if so, would these be close to the &quot;anything  boxes&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;we hope for?  I would like to think that in the world we are brought back
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;into (cryonic reanimation) there will be home models that can build houses
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and vehicles.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Any thoughts?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sincerely,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;

<P>The government will absolutely not allow the public access to nanotech,
<BR>
biotech, or any matter controlling technology. I thought of bringing this up
<BR>
in the drug thread.. there's work being done right now in geneticly
<BR>
engineering goats to produce valuable drugs in their milk. If this
<BR>
technology dropped to the price where anyone could do it for a few thousand
<BR>
dollars, it wouldn't be long before someone caught on to the idea of
<BR>
engineering goats to produce morphine in their milk as well, or other
<BR>
variations on this theme (I've had this idea for a while, in the form of
<BR>
engineering bees so that rather then stinger venom, they produce THC,
<BR>
morphine, cocaine, or whatever, which they inject into someone upon
<BR>
stinging). From what I understand, this would be technically possible today,
<BR>
by inserting the proper genes from the poppy, the coca plant, or the
<BR>
marijuana plant into the proper place in the bee genome.
<BR>
Nanotech would make drug access even easier. I think a good early nanotech
<BR>
product would be a mug which contains nanotech, and a port to connect to the
<BR>
internet. You plug it in, download instructions for making various drinks,
<BR>
fill the cup with water, and it sucks the rest of the ingredients out of the
<BR>
air to make you a cup of whatever you want. It wouldn't be long before
<BR>
people came up with instructions for making various drugs, or other illegal
<BR>
items.
<BR>
The solution, I hope but doubt, is for people to break free of the mindset
<BR>
that other people have to let them do things. If everyone (or a very high
<BR>
percentage of the population) looked upon government seizure of their
<BR>
property (legal or illegal) just as they looked upon any other thug doing
<BR>
the same thing, we wouldn't have the farce of government that we do.
<BR>
I think, and hope, that the solution will actually come about through space
<BR>
colonization. The first people to live on mars or the moon (after a possible
<BR>
small government scientific presence) will probably be extropian-minded. Up
<BR>
there, it won't much matter what an earthly government allows or doesn't
<BR>
allow. I forsee a possible situation where the most intelligent people leave
<BR>
earth, and governments set up a legislative &quot;berlin wall&quot; to keep them
<BR>
there, while getting more and more restrictive of personal liberty. Like its
<BR>
namesake, it will eventually be ripped down, but only after a long dark
<BR>
period.
