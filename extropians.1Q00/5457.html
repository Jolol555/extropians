regarding American Imperialism in response to Daniel Ust and Octavio 
<BR>
Rojas Diaz:
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Mexico is a very blessed land and you are very self-aware that many of 
</EM><BR>
its
<BR>
<EM>&gt; problems have been brought on by itself.  The old saying goes, &quot;a 
</EM><BR>
nation
<BR>
<EM>&gt; gets the government they deserve.&quot;  This says a lot about both Mexico 
</EM><BR>
and the
<BR>
<EM>&gt; United States for both good and bad.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree, however there have been several attempts over the history of 
<BR>
Mexico
<BR>
to get a better government, but they've been squashed by the 
<BR>
government, or
<BR>
they simply try to divide us so we don't work and cooperate together.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In Latin America especially though, there tends to be a lack of 
</EM><BR>
loyalty and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; common identity to bind together the populace in working together and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mutually benefiting eachother.  Is this a by-product of the class
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; structures introduced by the initial European colonizers?  Loyalty 
</EM><BR>
only to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; one's own social class?  This is becoming a real concern in the U.S. 
</EM><BR>
Also.
<BR>
<P>Yes, that is a big problem here, poor people is resented and angry, 
<BR>
and rich
<BR>
people just consider them an uneducated mob that deserve what they 
<BR>
want, and
<BR>
obviously everybody is loyal only to their social groups, and the same 
<BR>
happens
<BR>
in most of Latin America.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I read in a recent issue of _The Futurist_ magazine about three 
</EM><BR>
possible
<BR>
<EM>&gt; paths Mexico could take over the next few decades.  One scenario was 
</EM><BR>
very
<BR>
<EM>&gt; positive and encouraged economic growth and democracy, the other was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; business as usual and the last was a nosedive into economic and 
</EM><BR>
political
<BR>
<EM>&gt; squalor.  I hope you can read the article yourself at their website if 
</EM><BR>
it is
<BR>
<EM>&gt; available.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd love to read the article, do you have the URL? I hope we are able 
<BR>
to walk
<BR>
the path of economic growth and prosperity, and it is very probable
