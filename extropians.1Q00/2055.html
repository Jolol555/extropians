<P>&lt;&lt; Here's a review of an interesting-looking book that proposes that chimps 
<BR>
and 
<BR>
&nbsp;bonobos should enjoy certain legal rights now reserved for humans:
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.salon.com/books/it/2000/02/04/cage/index.html">http://www.salon.com/books/it/2000/02/04/cage/index.html</A>
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;My own thinking on the subject of the rights and duties of sentient 
<BR>
creatures 
<BR>
&nbsp;(played out on this list with excruciating inconsistency over the years) has 
<BR>
&nbsp;led me to thinking along the lines described in this review. &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I myself agree that the Great Apes; Chimpanzees, Bonobos, Gorillas, 
<BR>
Oranguatangs should be classified as persons.  The level of compency of 
<BR>
these people to participate and interact in our society remains to be seen.  
<BR>
But basic &quot;human&quot; rights should be applied to them.  I know that some 
<BR>
would point to the Chimpanzee and say we need them for medical research, 
<BR>
but I can not sacrifice another person simply because they are &quot;lesser&quot; or 
<BR>
&quot;different&quot; from me.  As a physician, I have explored my own thoughts and 
<BR>
feelings about that point quite a bit, and I still come to the same 
<BR>
conclusion.  
<BR>
And as a private individual, I know it would be wrong to harm an ape for my 
<BR>
own benefit (except in the unlikely event that the ape in question was a 
<BR>
direct 
<BR>
threat to me, in which case it would fall under self-defense, as would any 
<BR>
other person).  As a medical student, I presented at the American Medical 
<BR>
Student Association a resolution calling for the ending of all medical 
<BR>
research 
<BR>
on the Great Apes which would lead to physical or psychological harm.  
<BR>
Unfortunately, that attempt was defeated, chiefly in the name of continuing 
<BR>
AIDS research.  In future, I hope to revisit the issue, but in the arena of 
<BR>
medical professional organizations.  Hopefully by the time I am ready to 
<BR>
again, 
<BR>
I will have enough ammunition to get through to my fellow physicians that 
<BR>
these Great Apes are people, deserving of all the protections thereof.  For 
<BR>
other animal species I am yet trying to decide, but the Great Apes I have 
<BR>
grown convinced are people.
