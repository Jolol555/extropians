<EM>&gt;If you march up the beach with the tide, did you move the water?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;What if you float down a river?  It is very hard to tell how much
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;humans committed to change&quot; have actually changed things.  At any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;given time various people advocate all sorts of changes, and the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people who advocated the changes that actually happened often try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to take credit for them.  But how much credit do they deserve?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't know about taking credit...Many historians say that the 
<BR>
history of the past 100 years is a history of the spread of freedom, 
<BR>
of civil rights. Civil rights historians contend that civil rights 
<BR>
don't just 'happen', that the changes are catalyzed by decision.
<BR>
<P>Women didn't just get granted the right to vote, they had to fight, 
<BR>
march, starve, get beaten.  It was the death of one leading
<BR>
suffragette and the impending death of another that brought about 
<BR>
that particular change.  South Africans didn't just get 'granted' 
<BR>
their freedom, they had to fight and die for it.  Gays still don't
<BR>
have full respect, but they have more after making the decision to
<BR>
come out of the closet and educate everyone else.  
<BR>
<P>And so on.  These aren't passive processes--they involve active
<BR>
decisionmaking by individuals and groups.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Powerful demographic, economic, and other forces induce all sorts
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of social changes, and there is a big demand for spokespersons
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to explain and justify these changes.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Speaking as a veteran of three activist movements (peace, women's,
<BR>
disability) I can say that I've never seen anyone step forth to
<BR>
speak out *after* the change took place....It usually takes the
<BR>
courage of a few individuals and groups to speak out and spark
<BR>
that process of change.  It takes the decision of individuals
<BR>
to conduct public and private education, to get others to understand
<BR>
what they are fighting for.  That's a lot of work, and it takes
<BR>
some degree of training and ability.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;If there were a large pool of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;spokesperson-wannabes out there, seeking arguments which could make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;them famous, then the arguments might just regularly get made when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the audience is ready to hear them.
</EM><BR>
<P>Fame as a motivation?  The nature of activism demands public 
<BR>
attention to your message, but that's a little different from 
<BR>
fameseeking.  The risks alone would deter most fameseekers--many
<BR>
activists survive threats and attempts at violence.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;I haven't yet read these books, and so I can't yet agree whether
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;they do these things.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm going to bring you one to look at:  'It's a Jungle out there
<BR>
Jane--Understanding the Male Animal'.
