<EM>&gt; At the moment, the &quot;manufacturing&quot; industries are less than 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 18% of GDP, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such industries do a lot of non-manufacturing spending (like sales,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transport, storage, ...) Total spending on the design of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturables is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; probably much less.  So even making manufacturing and design 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free still
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; leaves people paying for &gt;70% of the things they pay for now.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
Yes, but what percentage of the services industry lives on the fact that
<BR>
people have no access to free manufactured goods?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The fraction of software effort now using the open source route is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; miniscule, the gains to specialization in production are now enormous,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and people don't give away raw materials with low enough transport and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; processing costs to be useful.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but even if it is minuscule, it is enough for lots of people.
<BR>
Transporting this to the nanotech scenario, how many people would drop out
<BR>
of the trade system because the open source designs are enough to live on
<BR>
and don't care (or learn not to care) about the rest.  I know i haven't paid
<BR>
for any software for a very,very long time (and this does not mean i have a
<BR>
bookmark to www.warez.com).  I would be very tempted to do the same if it
<BR>
applied to materials.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; There are thus many reasons to doubt the imagine of an early nano-gift
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economy, where trade is distant memory and people get 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; virtually everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they want from essentially free open source designs running 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on essentially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free generic factories built from essentially free raw materials.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
this is, IMHO, going way too far, but i wouldn't be surprised if
<BR>
survivability becomes a non-issue.
