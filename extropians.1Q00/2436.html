</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You mean it *isn't*? You should get out more -- or rather... er, never
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind. 8-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Or maybe I just have an especially fevered imagination.  :-)
<BR>
<P>But seriously, no, it isn't.  Picture, for a moment, one of those rare
<BR>
occasions when ambiance, circumstance and mood all come together in just the
<BR>
right way, with just the right person, to create one of the best experiences
<BR>
you've ever had.  That's what I think most of us want sex to be like all the
<BR>
time - a magical, wonderful, overpowering thing.
<BR>
<P>Unfortunately, magic like that only happens occasionally.  When you've been
<BR>
married for ten years it takes a lot of effort to keep sex from becoming
<BR>
just another boring routine, and most people don't succeed.
<BR>
<P>Fortunately, it doesn't have to stay that way.  I can envision all sorts of
<BR>
ways to improve on nature in this regard, and I'm pretty sure that I've
<BR>
barely scratched the surface of what is possible.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If it is strong in teenagers (which I doubt) that is a figment of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; way they have been raised, and the the fact that they are incarcerated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in institutions (schools) where conformity can be vital for survival
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (or at least for avoiding getting your head kicked in five times a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; day).
</EM><BR>
<P>Agreed, more or less.  America's insistence on forcing teenagers to be old
<BR>
children rather than young adults is causing all sorts of weird problems.
<BR>
But that's another thread...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;What most people want is to look like themselves, only better.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well... I don't know... 7 of 9's body is very tempting....
</EM><BR>
<P>I'd call it a 7 out of 10.  :-)
<BR>
<P>But you'd keep your own face, right?  And people would tinker with the
<BR>
details, for reasons both esthetic and practical.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Ooops, letting the side down. Sorry, Billy. Actually, I do agree with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you, given what you go on to say:
</EM><BR>
<P>Thanks.  Does anyone see an argument I've missed on this one?
