<EM>&gt;From Wired News:

<P>Britain's anti-drug coordinator says his country is winning
its war against drugs -- even though he seemed to have more
questions than answers at a press conference Monday. While
Keith Hellawell claimed the plan to reduce hard drug taking
by 25 percent by 2008 is on track, he as much conceded that
the scourge remains a society-wide problem. &quot;The fastest
[growing] groups of drug users are around the nightclub
scene,&quot; he said. &quot;They are achievers, employed, and with
disposable income. What makes them do it?&quot; If Britain's drug
czar can't answer that question, then who can?
<P>---
<P>Drug users are achievers, employed, and have disposable
incomes...  then why the war against drugs?
