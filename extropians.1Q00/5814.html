<EM>&gt; &gt;This isn't an either-or proposition.  Both &quot;normal&quot; medical care and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;longevity can both be financed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I realize that.  I was responding to Natasha who emphasized the need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counter the ubiquitous &quot;deathist&quot; meme.  My point was simply that it will be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; much easier to get people to support longevity research once it is clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the environment will be able to support 10 billion people who like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make babies but don't like to die.  It is hard to convince people that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indefinite life spans won't presently sap our environmental and agricultural
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; resources when people now typically only live less than 80 years and yet a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good percentage of us are living in poverty and starving.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not sure that such could be done, at least not just by funding
<BR>
medical infrastructure.  Suppose that we do manage to cure death - which
<BR>
is what we propose to do here.  Unless this cure causes sterility and
<BR>
can not be applied to anyone who has already sired a child, this would
<BR>
make humanity's growth rate permanently positive, barring catastrophies.
<BR>
Therefore, we could never be satisfied with having the world support X
<BR>
billion humans, for we would know that there would always be more than X
<BR>
at some future date.  Barring expansion into space - which remains only
<BR>
a theory until we actually have working and inhabited space stations or
<BR>
other colonies off of Earth, and thus is not currently a solution that
<BR>
many will entrust their futures to without some backup plan - this means
<BR>
that our planet would have to support an indefinitely growing number of
<BR>
people.
<BR>
<P>I think there may be a solution to this, though.  As has been noted, all
<BR>
doomsday predictions assume no enhancement of technology to support
<BR>
increased demand.  What if we could make popular the notion that
<BR>
technology will *always* rise to meet the challenge, at least for our
<BR>
most critical needs (which, logically, would have more people working on
<BR>
them to bring technology up to snuff)?  If most of the public accepted
<BR>
that we will always find a way to make enough food to feed all our
<BR>
people - even if we sometimes stumble in actually getting the food to
<BR>
the hungriest of mouths, but not in such a way as to make a larger
<BR>
fraction of humanity hungry - then all &quot;can the Earth support X billion
<BR>
humans&quot; questions become moot, no?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;2. The amount of money needed to make decent progress towards longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- to take the level you quoted, $100 million - would have very little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;practical impact on supplying &quot;normal&quot; medical care.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I question whether $100 million would have very much impact on longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research.  My guess is that there is currently at least that much being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spent right now on aging research and other research that will be of value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to life extensionists.  And sure $100 million would not end hunger, but you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; could damn sure build a lot of irrigation with it.
</EM><BR>
<P>And what do you do about the soldiers who hijack the farmers' harvest at
<BR>
gunpoint, so that they and their bosses may feast while the farmer
<BR>
starves?  The main cause of hunger is not a lack of food production.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;3. Longevity research may well advance &quot;normal&quot; medical care in ways
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that purely investing in &quot;normal&quot; medical care would never accomplish.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;For example, if one were to find a generic vaccine that made humans
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;immune to most or all viruses, that would have immediate applications
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;toward preventing people from getting sick - but such is much more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;likely to be discovered by researchers looking to minimize health
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;problems over infinite lives, as opposed to researchers looking to just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;let people live long enough to die at 60 or 70.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps, but I still maintain that if you couch it in terms like immortality
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; or indefinite life span research, you are simply not going to make any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; headway with the public, at least until we have global poverty, ignorance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and hunger already under control.
</EM><BR>
<P>Define &quot;under control&quot;.  I am pessimistic that these problems can be
<BR>
reduced enough that they dissapear from the public eye, at least within
<BR>
the predictable future.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;4. For the past several centuries, there have been some in the world who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have lived better than the others.  One way to introduce immortality for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;everyone would be to introduce it for the rich first, then as time goes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on - and the technology becomes more familiar and (one hopes)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;simpler/less expensive - introduce it to everyone else.  (&quot;Poverty&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;these days is not quite as hard a life as &quot;poverty&quot; was 100 years ago,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;at least in almost any industrialized country, due in part to this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;practice.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Oh sure, that's likely to go over *really* well.  &quot;Hey, lets all fund a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bunch of way-out research so Bill Gates can live forever, while millions of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; kids in the third world (not to mention a few thousand right in the good old
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US of A) go to bed hungry every night.&quot;  Nobody's going to touch that with a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 10 foot pole.  Not Republicans, not Democrats, nobody.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not saying that that's what we advertise, just that that's what will
<BR>
probably happen.  But this does suggest &quot;let the rest of the world
<BR>
bugger off; we want to make *you* live forever&quot; types of memes,
<BR>
targetted at anyone who is aware of people in worse poverty than
<BR>
themselves...which would, I suspect, cover most of people in any kind of
<BR>
position to fund longevity research.  (For instance: most Americans can
<BR>
be convinced that there are poorer people in other countries.  If they
<BR>
think that citizens of the USA will be among the first to benefit from
<BR>
this research, and perhaps almost the only ones save for some rich
<BR>
non-Americans, they might have little problem if their government
<BR>
supports said research.  Repeat for any country where the citizens have
<BR>
an effective political voice...and where they don't, then sell only to
<BR>
those who do control the purse strings; similar for non-country holders
<BR>
of wealth.  A cynical approach, perhaps, but might this work?)
