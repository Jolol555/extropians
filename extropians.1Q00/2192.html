<EM>&gt; It doesn't really matter, storing energy in inertia wheels isn't

<EM>&gt; or a straight hoax, the company site strikes me slightly kooky), I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; like the 1 kW/1.5 kg density specs, and the non-Carnot nature of the

<EM>&gt; over total operational time the device releases.

<P>I've come to the conclusion over the years that if the press release or
<BR>
website concentrates on the applications rather than the technology itself,
<BR>
and the tech has not yet been clearly demonstrated, it's vapor.  Sure, high
<BR>
energy density flywheels would be very useful, this has been known for a
<BR>
long long time- but nothing on their site shows that they know how to
<BR>
*build* such things.
<BR>
<P>I believe in hardware- I've been testing a complete rocket engine and its
<BR>
ignition system all week, and the functional hardware is essential to
<BR>
making real progress.  Talk is cheap, action is difficult.
