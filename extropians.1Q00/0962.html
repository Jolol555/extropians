<P>&lt;&lt;  seems obvious to me that, in a vain attempt to preserve its own
<BR>
&nbsp;existence, the government will make every attempt to limit such a
<BR>
&nbsp;powerful technology.  
<BR>
<P>First of all, you are assuming a government that is unchanged from the one we 
<BR>
have today, which is highly unlikely. Nanotech will drastically change the 
<BR>
values we have now, themoney systems, and ultimately the American Government. 
<BR>
What we have today is so very much based on symbols:  property, money and 
<BR>
gold... 
<BR>
<P>Secondly, how can you be sure that we will not *want* - nay *demand* tight 
<BR>
securities placed on such a potentially &quot;grey-goo&quot; prone technology? 
<BR>
<P>&lt;&lt;Once a critical mass of people realize the true
<BR>
&nbsp;power of nanotech, one can't help but predict and end-all revolution
<BR>
&nbsp;to take back what was denied from the public&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Again, not to nit-pick,  but you are assuming that the &quot;public&quot; will want 
<BR>
nanotechnology.  I mean the technology, not the products... 
<BR>
It may be that like medicines, where not everyone wants the ability to 
<BR>
self-prescibe potentially dangerous and addictive substances( some 
<BR>
libertarians and junkies aside), or how not everyone wants to make an atomic 
<BR>
power station in their backyard.... the average american family may wisely 
<BR>
abstain from doing their own nano-homekits.  Risky at best.
<BR>
<P>. &lt;&lt;&lt; Will nanotech weapons
<BR>
&nbsp;be used?  Highly likely?  Will humanity survive? . . &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>Of course, nanotech weapons will be used, or at least developed. Doh!
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hm...  Humanity surviving depends on sooooo many things... personally I 
<BR>
am surprised we haven't already gone extinct, based on the way our lizard 
<BR>
brain clashes with the wrap around...
