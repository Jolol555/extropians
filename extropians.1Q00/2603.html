<EM>&gt; Just kidding. I think I bought two or three weeks worth of dinner food,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; though I did stock up on ammo.... he he.

<P>Seriously, I did prepare too.  A lot of people where I work snickered at me.
<BR>
They were under the impression that either you do nothing at all for such
<BR>
things or you spend a huge portion of your 401K on otherwise useless items.
<BR>
I won't go over the entire list of items I used to prepare, but the cost was
<BR>
about $150 and I dispersed it over several months.
<BR>
<P>For instance, I drink bottled water anyway, so I just stocked up on it.
<BR>
This doesn't mean I've enough to fill an olympic swimming pool -- just
<BR>
enough for several weeks.  In fact, if I don't shop for bottled water, I
<BR>
won't run out now until March of this year.  (I had finished this stocking
<BR>
up in December.)
<BR>
<P>Other things, like having a few flashlights and some emergency candles are
<BR>
things one should have for just plain vanilla natural disasters such as
<BR>
hurricanes (I live along the Easter Seaboard of the US) and winter storms.
<BR>
These were low cost and can be stored for a pretty long time.
<BR>
<P>Nothing I got for Y2K was really useful only for Y2K.  Nor was or am I
<BR>
financially strapped because of it.
