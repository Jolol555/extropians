Dear Amara,
<BR>
<P>I`m very sorry that you want to take a break from the WWW.
<BR>
I`m aware of the fact that as soon as you have your own website - and 
<BR>
as soon as it is reachable by the search engines this part of your 
<BR>
life becomes public. As for my website, the first (and so far only!) 
<BR>
entry in my guestbook was by a guy offering adult photos. Still, 
<BR>
I think, it`s important to stay involved with the WWW in order to make 
<BR>
a difference, to change something. Sure, the first reaction on 
<BR>
disappointing experiences is usually to back off. I`m convinced that
<BR>
you thought about turning your back on the WWW very long and that this
<BR>
decision wasn`t easy to make for you. Maybe your expectations were too 
<BR>
great in a way. I think especially people like us (extropians) have to 
<BR>
learn to deal with ignorance and misunderstanding. But if we want to 
<BR>
stay only with the audience of which we know that it will appreciate 
<BR>
us in the way we expect it - well, then we will never make any 
<BR>
difference. 
<BR>
I remember a quote by Epictetus: What disturbs people`s minds is not 
<BR>
events but their judgements on events. So, don`t think of your 
<BR>
experiences with the WWW as something that brings you down. The value 
<BR>
of the WWW rises with the value of the contributions we make to it. 
<BR>
And your contribution was very valuable.
<BR>
<P>With respect and best regards,
<BR>

<EM>&gt; Dear Extropes,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am wondering how representative is the World Wide Web of what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exists in the Real World? Do you think that the way that people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; behave in that medium is representative of their behavior in real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life? I have participated in that &quot;experiment&quot; for the last 5 years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by providing a large Web site with very valuable content (so I was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; told), and after these years, it's time for me to take a break from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Web for a while. I'm really cynical and jaded and disappointed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in what I've learned about people who use the Web, so it's time to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stop, and be &quot;empty&quot;, in that Zen way. I reached a kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; saturation point, I think.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Today, I wiped my Web site clean. All 25 Mb and 300+ files. I didn't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give notice or put forwards on any of my pages, and I know that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; few thousand people today (and every day for a while) may be a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little bit unhappy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One of my largest disappointments with the Web, was that folks who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; visited and wrote me often didn't connect that there is a real live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human being, with a real life on the other side of those pages. They
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seldom were considerate or courteous. Since 90% of the folks that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wrote me, wanted me to do something for them (help them with their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; homework, help them with their research project, give them other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information, etc.), I would say that at least half didn't bother to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; address me by my name (those of you who saw my site know that my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; name was everywhere), or sign their own name, or even say &quot;please&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Many people also mistakenly thought that, because my Web pages were
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there for their use, that _I_ was a free resource for them too. One
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (college-age, I would say) person who wrote me a couple of years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ago, bluntly told me: &quot;You should add compression links to your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wavelet pages&quot;. When I wrote him back and said that &quot;if he pays me a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; lot of money, I will consider it&quot;, he sent me an indignant letter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; telling me how rude I was! I've also faced strangers calling me, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; showing up at my door with their questions that they wanted me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; answer. I know that the proper response is: &quot;My hourly fee is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; $XMegaBucks&quot;, perhaps we can discuss it then&quot;, but I was so
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; surprised by their actions that I became flustered and annoyed, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't think of a good response fast enough. I never thought that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; folks would have that audacity, yet they did.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Even when I made it quite clear in several texts at my site that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; didn't have the &quot;resources&quot; (time, money, my old repetitive strain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; injury limited my computer usage, etc.), I still received alot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; queries for my help. I suppose that those folks were in too much of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a rush to read that, or to care.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Last year I put notice on some of my more active pages that I needed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donations to help me with costs, since I am living on a student
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stipend, and it was difficult to maintain the pages. Out of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 100,000 or so visits since I added my notice, only 6 people have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donated money (none from any of the very wealthy corporations that I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know use my site). While I am very appreciative of those 6 people's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; donations, something seemed really wrong with this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since I considered my Web pages the &quot;shape&quot; I gave myself in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; World Wide Web, I always wondered what was &quot;enough&quot; information to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; give for my purposes, and what was &quot;too much&quot;. The phrase &quot;the map
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is not the territory&quot; seems particularly apt. I encountered some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; situations where some people figured that they &quot;knew&quot; Amara enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from my pages, and didn't need to ask me questions and learn in real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; life, who Amara was, and they proceeded to judge and criticize.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In my opinion, those actions were laziness or fear-based, but those
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; actions caused me quite a bit of grief, anyway. So I caution folks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about how many &quot;pointers&quot; to give about oneself on their Web pages.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And if you are as &quot;open&quot; as I am, then maybe the World Wide Web is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the wrong forum, or maybe you should just provide a minimal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I have to say that I really like how the Web enables people to meet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each other from far-away places, but I also wonder if this extra
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; media layer promotes a less-than-honest representation of oneself. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; confess that I have a soft spot for bright, interesting people, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are offering me interesting conversational topics, stories, poetry,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gifts...:-) , if I have the time, or I'm in town, etc. in order to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; read their messages, but I've encountered more than my share of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people (OK, men), who don't describe who they are accurately, or who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are unable to state what they want and need, even when I ask direct
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; questions (and I am very direct). Several times I found myself in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pretty painful situations because of that dishonesty. (Sometimes, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; think that I'm too naive for the Web, or maybe even for the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world. That's why astronomy is a good field for me :-))
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So while I hear about all of you transhumans &quot;moving on up&quot; and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; getting your positions and places visible on the World Wide Web,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; here is one jaded extrope who is &quot;moving on out&quot; and taking a break
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from the Web for a while.
