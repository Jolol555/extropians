<EM>&gt; As I have pointed out here before, it is the patent concept that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a socialist one--it derives from the labor theory of value--the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; discredited idea that work is valuable in itself.  Just because an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inventor does work, that's no reason to assume it is valuable, any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than a craftsman making artifacts no one wants.
</EM><BR>
<P>But patents make no statements about value.  A patent can be as worthless
<BR>
as any other piece of property.  Do property rights in other fields derive
<BR>
from the labor theory of value?  Does the fact that someone can own land
<BR>
imply that the land must be considered valuable?  No, any form of property,
<BR>
including patents, can be worthless.
<BR>
<P>Patents extend the notion of property into the abstract.  Whether this is
<BR>
good or effective is debatable, but it has nothing to do with the labor
<BR>
theory of value.
