<P>The ultimate problem with solar power is that there isn't enough of it. I've 
<BR>
seen projections in which the planet's power needs by 2050 will be such that a 
<BR>
band of 100% efficient solar cells 10 miles wide and wrapping the whole equator 
<BR>
will not give enough power. So, even if we converted all highways and all 
<BR>
roofing materials to 98% efficient solar cells, we're *still* going to have to 
<BR>
go out and find other fuel sources. (Note that I'm assuming we don't get around 
<BR>
to huge solar collectors in space. THAT way we could get enough power for the 
<BR>
planet.)

<P><EM>&gt;            When the oil runs dry I see things getting very difficult in 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Saudi Arabia and elsewhere unless they can live off profits from their 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; national portfolios.  In the state of Alaska we have our humble permanent 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fund. :)
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't count on the oil running dry anytime soon. If you read &quot;The State of 
<BR>
Humanity&quot; (which I can't seem to find on my bookshelf, so I can't tell you the 
<BR>
authors' name...) you'll see that there are estimates that we have over 200 
<BR>
years worth of oil, even taking into account our projected growth of energy 
<BR>
use, and that by THAT time we should have more reserves available than we do 
<BR>
now, due to increases in extraction processes. And all this assumes that the 
<BR>
theories about the 'fossil' fuels being of non-animal origin (and thus orders 
<BR>
of magnitude more plentiful than has been assumed) are all false.
