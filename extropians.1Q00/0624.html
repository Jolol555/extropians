<EM>&gt; Indeed, if anything, &quot;opiating&quot; the masses seems like EXACTLY the sort of

<EM>&gt; You might argue that the Government is acting foolishly, then, but not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that it's covering its own backside by outlawing drug use.

<EM>&gt; Am I missing something big here?

<P>Yes.
<BR>
<P>Follow the money.
<BR>
<P>Who make money from the war on drugs?
<BR>
<P>In the USA, it's the DEA. The FBI. Wackenhut corporation (private
<BR>
prisons). Every police force that auctions off goods seized under civil
<BR>
forfeiture laws. Every police force that gets extra officers assigned
<BR>
to it to protect the public from eeevil junkies or to operate the Drug
<BR>
Squad. Every politician who gets a sound-bite out of being Tough on Drugs.
<BR>
Every dealer who is able to sell his produce for a thousand times what
<BR>
it really costs to product.
<BR>
<P>The War on Drugs turned hot in the USA around the end of Prohibition. It
<BR>
was a great way for over-bloated police departments to avoid having
<BR>
to downsize, and it could be played up on racist grounds. Post-WW2, it
<BR>
could be exported to the rest of the world fairly easily. Everybody got
<BR>
to play; even the CIA, who used it for money laundering to fund black
<BR>
ops in the 60's. Today, Prohibition is a huge, sprawling, multi- billion
<BR>
dollar industry. It also keeps the price of the produce artificially
<BR>
high. It is in nobody's interests to discontinue the war on drugs,
<BR>
except that of the consumers.
