<EM>&gt; James, its not so much that people are willing to *give up* freedom
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as it is being taken, not so much by governements but by individuals.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; Consider the privacy issues we talk about.  Cameras are getting

<P>I've been watching the development of these things. Actually the prices at this
<BR>
site seem high. Have you ever read Jim Halperin's &quot;The First Immortal&quot;? These
<BR>
remind me of the 3D wrist cams he had in the novel that supposedly helped reduce
<BR>
crime. Everyone wore them and the feed was sent immediately to a huge database
<BR>
and if I recall eventually to Strong AI. Any crime committed against a person
<BR>
was witnessed by this system. It is both comforting and worrisome just like the
<BR>
truth SCIPS also in the story.
<BR>
<P>In some respects I see some things of this nature as inevitable. An example is
<BR>
we want the convenience of credit cards so we don't have to file for a loan
<BR>
every time we want to purchase something, especially something expensive like a
<BR>
refrigerator. It's safer aainst theft or loss to have plastic rrather than carry
<BR>
the $600 to $3000 one might shell out for the fridge. However, we give up some
<BR>
bit of privacy for this convenience. Can it be reversed? No. No one is going to
<BR>
give up the convenience anymore than we will go back to riding horses instead of
<BR>
driving cars.
<BR>
<P>We further give up even more privacy when it becomes necessary to protect our
<BR>
credit assets. To these ends we will be soon looking into an eye piece to read
<BR>
our iris pattern. I doubt most people have thought about the fact this is
<BR>
tantamount to getting fingerprinted without first committing a crime--the usual
<BR>
impetuous for finger printing. Will this trend be reversed? Not as long as
<BR>
thieves exist to steal your assets and identity. I could go on about this but I
<BR>
won't. I'm sure everyone here is bright enough to already know all this stuff.
