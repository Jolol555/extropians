<P>&lt;&lt; why should Western-style harmonies and melodies be
<BR>
&nbsp;considered the fundamentals? 
<BR>
<P>There's no &quot;should&quot; about any of my Musings.. you'll come to know that as you 
<BR>
get to know me...  you raise a good point. I merely invited you to join me in 
<BR>
a bit of play...
<BR>
My sandbox has it's own toys... I think in Western terms because i was ear 
<BR>
trained that way. It's a bit disquieting to me to listen to some eastern 
<BR>
music, and arabic, other twelve tone systems and quarter notes, but only to 
<BR>
an extent.  I prefer African and Brazilian most of all..
<BR>
I am biased by the culture i come from - that's truth... 
<BR>
<P><P>&lt;&lt; The fundamental definition of music are that it is
<BR>
&nbsp;sound organized through time -- perhaps there are other, more interesting 
<BR>
ways
<BR>
&nbsp;to structure compositions without using harmonies and melodies associated 
<BR>
with
<BR>
&nbsp;earlier periods of music.
<BR>
<P>There may be, but as I said in a post about art, orignal and unknown sounds 
<BR>
are cacophony at first, until we associate them in some way...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&lt;&lt;One of the things I try to do when I write
<BR>
&nbsp;techno/drum'n'bass is to look for such alternative ways to structure the
<BR>
&nbsp;composition.

<P>Yes, I would be delighted to hear this, it sounds like you know a lot of 
<BR>
things and have a lot of trix up yoru sleeve...
<BR>
It's odd, but I don't think of DJ'ing as being particularly an original art 
<BR>
form, usually it's a lot of snatching things from here and there and 
<BR>
combining them in new ways...
<BR>
... it's gotten me curious to hear you defend &quot;new&quot; sounds...
