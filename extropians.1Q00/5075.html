<P>
<EM>&gt; Thats a disengenuous argument. Say I create a new type of fishing reel.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I make them. Someone buys my fishing reel under my license to them not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to copy it. That someone's fishing buddy sees how the reel works, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decides to manufacture the same reel, however since he doesn't have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; pay the amortized costs of my research and development, he can underbid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; me in the market, and drives me out of business. Thats how your
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; patentless society would work.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'm not disingenuous at all--you have it exactly right this time.  You
<BR>
(and the present public consensus) seem to think that this scenario
<BR>
would be a bad thing.  I see it as simply fostering different kinds of
<BR>
creativity.  Yes, long-term speculative research would be less likely
<BR>
to profit without patents.  Good!  Long-term speculative research
<BR>
_should_ be risky.  Without patents, most &quot;inventions&quot; will be small
<BR>
incremental improvements to existing things: adaptations, combinations,
<BR>
improved processes, etc.  That's what creativity is anyway: what's
<BR>
disingenuous is the silly idea that completely original ideas exist.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If a farmer invented a new type of apple, and spent $1 billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; researching and developing it, yet his neigbors felt that it was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; perfectly ok to buy one of his apples at market, extract its DNA, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; start growing the same apples themselves, but since they don't have the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cost of the research and development that the first farmer did, they can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; run him out of business. They don't even have to buy an apple, just go
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to the dump and pick up a discarded apple core. The property rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; extend to the added value of the investment of research and development
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the new idea, which is why patent rights are temporary, so that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; inventor can recoupe the investment in R&amp;D, before it becomes fair game
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for the open market.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, that's exactly what patents are intended to do (and in some cases
<BR>
in fact do successfully).  I simply argue that they shouldn't.  Yes, I
<BR>
want that garbage-scrounger to be able to grow his own apples on his
<BR>
own land from the other's DNA.  What that means is that the first
<BR>
farmer would be stupid to have invested lots of money in research that
<BR>
can't be recouped by the simple market advantages of being first and
<BR>
by having a good reputation.  Inventors will always make more than
<BR>
followers, because they have talent and can keep using it--without
<BR>
patents they just have to be smarter about how they use it to make sure
<BR>
they stay ahead of the followers.  The upsides of the patentless system
<BR>
are many--first, small incremental improvements to things happen more
<BR>
because there's no legal impediment to them; craftsmanship becomes
<BR>
valuable again; the inventors are unrestrained in what sources they
<BR>
can draw from to create; and perhaps best of all, a million patent
<BR>
lawyers are forced to find productive work.
