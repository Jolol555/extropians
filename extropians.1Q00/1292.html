<P><EM>&gt; I've been raised in an environment that taught me to be terribly 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-less and to 'believe' that &quot;happiness&quot; is the only goal in life,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; i.e., to always strive for the happiness and well-being of your neighbour, 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even to the extent where this is detrimental to yourself -- and to believe 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that altruistic selflessness is the most important cause for happiness. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've had some of the same upbringing and would probably say that making
<BR>
others happy is something that makes me happy.  Somewhere along the
<BR>
way I seem to have lost an entire set of things involved in generating
<BR>
&quot;self-happiness&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; I wrote: 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  Big mistake.  I would say that being raised like that is in a fairly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  direct way responsible for costing me amounts ranging from 6 to 7 figures.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Being 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; altruistically helpful like that does nothing else than hinder the overall 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chances for survival both of yourself (you give away your money before you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; get a chance to do eanything useful with it) and of those other people you're 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; helping (it makes them dependent on you).
</EM><BR>
<P>Just so my comments aren't misinterpreted -- my experiences in Russia
<BR>
involved a very calculated equation utilizing the resources I had to
<BR>
do research I viewed as necessary in aging.  The fact that it could
<BR>
benefit scientists in difficult situations was not a primary motivating
<BR>
factor (unlike say the activities of George Soros).  Initially there
<BR>
was a strong motivation to transplant some Western research approaches
<BR>
and business concepts (ala the parable of teaching a man how to fish
<BR>
rather than giving him a fish for diner), so I wasn't trying to make
<BR>
people dependent.
<BR>
<P>The parts left out of the equation were (a) the fact that Russia is
<BR>
has waters populated by sharks (previously unknown to a middle-class
<BR>
raised American, even with experience in the New York finance industry)
<BR>
and (b) you should be very careful about branching very far from your
<BR>
known areas of expertise.
<BR>
<P>Some lessons that eventually surfaced:
<BR>
(a) Always have plan B and perhaps plan C (essential for Russia).
<BR>
(b) There are as many sharks in America as Russia (if you look closely).
<BR>
(c) There are concepts that cannot translate across cultures.
<BR>
(d) Knowledgeable management is crucial.
<BR>
(e) Never structure your business strategy towards a single primary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;investor.
<BR>
<P>I walked past a woman in the metro tonight.  She had one young child
<BR>
standing beside her and another infant in her arms.  The arm holding
<BR>
the infants head ended in an outstretched palm.  At the end of
<BR>
the passage was a seemingly talented flutist playing not sad, but
<BR>
not happy tunes.  I noticed a 10 ruble (~$.30) note in his flute case.
<BR>
Whom should I have helped -- both, neither?  I really don't know
<BR>
anymore.
