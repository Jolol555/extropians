<P>
<EM>&gt; Patents don't cover ideas.  Any IP lawyer will tell you that.  Patents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cover implementations.  There has to be an implementation, and *only*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that particular implemented technique is covered.  No fundamental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; algorithms or ideas are covered. 
</EM><BR>
<P>No, actually patents _do_ apply to the ideas as well.  Copyrights
<BR>
don't apply to ideas, just particular expressions of them--but that's
<BR>
not the case with patents.  If you patent a gadget, and someone else
<BR>
uses your design to build a similar gadget using different materials
<BR>
and slight modifications, but still clearly based on your ideas, he
<BR>
is infringing under present law.
