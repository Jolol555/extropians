<EM>&gt; &gt; The test actually works AGAINST the agent-firing hypothesis, as in

<EM>&gt; &gt; the FLIR recreation, people are visible next to all the fired weapons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whereas in the original FLIR, no contiguous people are visible.  Guns
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; do not kill people unless other people are firing them, and such people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; being visible in EVERY instance of the &quot;recreational&quot; gunfire, but in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; NO instance of the original glints, the test results do not bode well
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; for the contentions of the Branch Davidians' attorney that such glints
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; represent gunfire. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Another reason why the people may show up in this footage and not in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the original footage is that the ambient temperature and ground
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temperature on the day of the original incident were very close to human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; body temperature, while the recreation film was shot at temperatures of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 69 degrees, a 30 degree difference. Additionally, there was not a fire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; going in the recreation to dampen the sensitivity of the FLIR at low
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; temperatures. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Michael is right on the money for this one.  Humans and other animals will
<BR>
quickly disappear into the ground clutter as the ambient temperature
<BR>
approaches their normal body temperature, particularly if they are
<BR>
stationary.  The practical effect is that the effective resolution of
<BR>
human objects drops as the ambient temperature increases.  In other words,
<BR>
while it is easy to resolve a person a quarter 400m away when the ambient
<BR>
temperature is 60F, you have to be practically on top of a person to
<BR>
resolve them when the temperature is 90F.  In my own experience (using IR
<BR>
in a search mode), IR is almost useless on warm summer days because you
<BR>
have to get so close that you can see what you are looking for without the
<BR>
IR.  It works great at night, though.
<BR>
<P>Gunfire on the other hand, is always much hotter than ambient.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; All of these factors, as well as the use of dyes and starches in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; clothing could be contributing factors in why the people's bodies showed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up in the recreation, but not the original incident.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I don't think this is a factor, since FLIR is a passive technology.
<BR>
<P>As I understand it, the fabrics/dyes used in BDUs are non-reflective in the
<BR>
IR spectrum so that you don't stand out when painted with an IR beam
<BR>
(e.g. from near spectrum devices like night vision).  You can't effectively
<BR>
shield a person against far infrared e.g. FLIR.  For hunters, there is a UV
<BR>
issue with some detergeants and brighteners, since certain animals can see
<BR>
into the UV spectrum.
