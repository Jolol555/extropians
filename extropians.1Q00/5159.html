<P><EM>&gt; Possibly so. Thinking about it, it seems likely that any resurrection would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be carried out on a case-by-case basis by interested individuals, rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  than through some global effort. That might mean that such people would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  be 'reinstituted', although (1) doubtless some far-right group would love 
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  see Hitler popping round for tea and biscuits and (2) no-one is sure who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Jack-the-ripper was, so if s/he was resurrected, who'd call for justice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  against him/her?
</EM><BR>
I seem to remember an old NPR reading of the Russian Poet, Voznesenzki 
<BR>
(hooked on Phonics works for me!) reading that the dead are judged not by a 
<BR>
Holy Tribunal, but by a worker's committee deciding the actions of one of 
<BR>
their peers.  Perhaps an all-around pimp-slapping for Adork &amp; Uncle Joe 
<BR>
Stalin might be in order?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Ah! A thought: at least those people given the death penalty and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;subsequently cleared could be brought back. Boy, would they be pissed.

<P>A more critical issue (for me) is the How questions of &quot;resurrection&quot;; like, 
<BR>
by what means might such a strange thing be successfully accomplished?  I 
<BR>
have read Tipler's stuff, and Hans Moravec's Mind Children and Robot; but 
<BR>
there appears to be nobody else having written essays on this, even as an 
<BR>
intellectual exercise. Where's all the philosophers and scholars at, 
<BR>
regarding this??
