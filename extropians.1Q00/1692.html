Clearly a lack of awareness of genetic algorithms, neural nets, etc.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I mentioned that she was also programmed, by genes and culture, and she got
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; highly indignant. I was trying to pretend she was a machine!
</EM><BR>
<P>Denying the truth doesn't make it untrue.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; She did things *just because she wanted to*! She'd broken away from the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; restrictions of her social upbringing etc etc. Not very much, you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven't, I said, and her face swelled attractively.
</EM><BR>
<P>Exactly.  Where would the &quot;motivation&quot; have come from to do what
<BR>
she *wanted to do* if not from her genes or environment?!?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; No, I said, what I mean is... you're speaking English now,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; aren't you? You're wearing clothing not unlikely the garments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we all wear. I see no Zulu hat upon your head. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Damien,
<BR>
<P>I want to applaud and acknowledge your willingness to engage in this.
<BR>
I did something not dissimilar from the audience in a New York bookstore
<BR>
about a year ago, where the author was &quot;touting&quot; the after-death
<BR>
&quot;white-light&quot;... and I was commenting about cryonics and the possibility
<BR>
of &quot;not&quot; dying.
<BR>
<P>People just don't get it and the *only* thing that can shake them
<BR>
out of their mud-pits is an earthquake of monumental proportions
<BR>
(meaning you have to challenge everything they believe).  They
<BR>
will get defensive.  There will be people for whom subtle approaches
<BR>
will work.  At the same time there will be people for whom rationale
<BR>
thinking will prevail.  Save the rationale thinkers.  The rest are
<BR>
doomed anyway (though, in testimony to my more &quot;sensitive&quot;, &quot;reformed&quot;,
<BR>
&quot;other-aware&quot; self -- I truly, truly wish it were otherwise.)
<BR>
<P>As a suggestion -- When a person gets &quot;defensive&quot; or &quot;agitated&quot; --
<BR>
point that out and ask them &quot;What are you afraid of?&quot;.  People
<BR>
can be afraid of change, but mostly they are afraid of death
<BR>
(because change threatens to increase their chance of death).
<BR>
Then point out that these technologies are likely to decrease
<BR>
the chance of death and prolong their longevity.  Then they
<BR>
either have to deny your assertions, reprogram their mindsets
<BR>
or resort to irrationality.
<BR>
<P>Attack the denials on factual or probability basis, accept the
<BR>
reprogramming, and coldly point out the irrationality as such.
<BR>
Allow people to stew in their own soup after you have provided
<BR>
ample room to climb out of the pot.  The survivors will get it.
<BR>
The people who are dead anyway will not.
<BR>
<P>We all are &quot;agents&quot; of natural selection.
<BR>
<P>Robert
