<P>
I don't have much time for this, so I have to be selective/brief. Also 
<BR>
this is starting to get past the point of diminishing returns.

<BR>
<EM> &gt; Now, I think that the case of cryopreservation is a lot closer to my example
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; than yours.  Typical slides of preserved tissue show a bewildering jumble of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; mixed-up parts, not a homogeneous sludge.  In this kind of situation the
</EM><BR>
<P>You'll never see a homogenous sludge because the system has not been
<BR>
perfectly homogenized (I don't know why you did expect that), and also
<BR>
because there is autoassembly. You can be looking at pure artefacts,
<BR>
yet thinking you're looking at native structure. This can be very
<BR>
deceptful. As I said, things look just great on vanilla light
<BR>
micrographs.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; I'm a software engineer - and yes, that is a very different thing than being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; a programmer.  But that's another thread.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I urge you to accept my word for it that software people believe in an
<BR>
orderly world. Too orderly world. Way too orderly world. It is both
<BR>
because of the self selected personality style and because of the
<BR>
training. Heck, I've been noticing some of it myself. You need to take
<BR>
that intrinsic bias into account when you look at things.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; If I use a true random generator (or a pseudorandom generator unknown
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; to you) to scramble the picture, information is lost. Period.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; No kidding.  I've said that several times myself.  There's no need to keep
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; beating a dead horse.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
I think it just moved a bit. There! It's just pretending.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; You are surely aware that the position you question are held by the
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; only specialists in the matter there are? There are no better ones
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; yet. What are your credentials in the matter? Programmer, aren't you?
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; Ah, the argument from authority.  Does this mean you don't have actual data
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; on hand?
</EM><BR>
<P>If you ask me whether I'll believe Merkle or Fahy when it comes to
<BR>
interpreting electron micrographs, I will hesitate about 250
<BR>
ms. (About as long as it takes me to understand the question). Call it
<BR>
blind belief in authority, if you must.
<BR>
<P>Also, I think I have a pretty good intuition for physical processes. I 
<BR>
can think on my own. I think.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; There are no specialists on brain reconstruction.  Neurobiology,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; conventional medicine and cryopreservation are all only tangentially
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; related.  Asking a specialist in one of these fields about reconstruction
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; techniques is like asking a paint-and-canvas artist about digital image
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; processing.  Heck, most 'experts' still seem to think that clinical death
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and the capacity for spontaneous recovery are meaningful yardsticks here.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
1) I am usually not known for being conservative
<BR>
2) on this list I arguably know more about the matter than anybody
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;else 
<BR>
<P>I also intend to find out a lot more in the years to come.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; The only group that even tries to understand the real situation are the few
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; pioneers who do cryopreservation research for the cryonics organizations,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and they haven't had the time, funding or manpower to create the kind of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; well-supported body of experience that would allow them to become a real
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; specialty.  Besides, the last I heard they were cautiously optimistic except
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; when they're asking for money.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
They wouldn't be asking for money if they didn't want to find out more
<BR>
about what is going on. Otherwise I'm not sure about the optimism bit,
<BR>
with the exception of the kidney cryopreservation (that one might
<BR>
actually work, albeit probably not economical by the time it is
<BR>
perfected).
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Meanwhile, the people whose opinions I most respect in this regard
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; unanimously hold the same position I do.  The only difference between my
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; claim and the comments that Drexler, Merkle et. al. make is that I left out
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; the minimal qualifiers that scientists habitually attach to any statement of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; fact.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Fine, you have your authorities, I have mine.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; &gt; So we assume a best case as default. No further research needs to be
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; &gt; done, because the information Is Still In There, Somehow.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; No, we take past experience as our guide.  Finding ways to computationally
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; unscramble mangled structures is so common that we should expect it to
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; happen as a matter of course whenever someone decides to devote some real
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; effort to any given problem.  If you don't think it can be done in this
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; particular case, you need to actually show that the necessary information
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; does not exist.
</EM><BR>
<P>Once again, in the topsy-turvy world of cryonics the bringer of bad
<BR>
news bears the burden of proof. Don't expect me to waste a lot of my
<BR>
time on it.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Which brings me back to the point you've been ignoring.  The fact that a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; structure 'appears' scrambled says nothing about its actual information
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; content.  The fact that cremation and long-term decomposition cause
</EM><BR>
<P>Nothing indeed. It's all just a PRNG, deep down below. Once you know
<BR>
the algorithm, you can reverse it. In a vision, St. Margolus told me
<BR>
that, while cherubs Fredkin and Toffioli sang a sweet duet above.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; irreversible damage is easy to demonstrate, but the same is not true of less
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; severe insults that leave substantial amounts of structure intact.  So, do
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; you have any actual experimental evidence regarding the degree of
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; information loss caused by various forms of trauma?  Failing that, do you
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; have a good logical argument for believing that the information loss is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; catastrophic?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
You'll have your evidence, hopefully in form of a few
<BR>
publications. Once again, don't expect me to waste significant amounts
<BR>
of my time pounding the message home. I do not care enough to try to
<BR>
change your mind.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; You need to calm down and start actually reading me before you reply.  Look
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; at Drexler's scenario in Engines of Creation for a typical example of what
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; I'm talking about.  You've got a bazillion MIPS of computing power being
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; used to run something that sounds like a mating between a molecular CAD
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; program and an expert system.  I understand why he didn't want to spend
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; another 50 pages getting the reader fully up to speed on what is really
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; possible, but his brief references to engineering AI go right past most
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; people without ever making an impression.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have been telling you all the time that for the purposes of
<BR>
argumentation you can assume to have access to perfect
<BR>
technology. Behold, yon dead horse, in a perfect illustration of
<BR>
reversiblity, just rose and is galloping away as briskly as ever. 
<BR>
D e s t r u c t i o n  o f  i n f o r m a t i o n. N o  O m e g a. 
<BR>
No other constraints. This are the assumptions I'm operating on. 
<BR>
<P>Did I already mention I was a big pessimist?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; Certainly, there are people around who know better.  Drexler is one of them,
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; and so are most of the other big names in nanotech.  But most people (even a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; lot of extropian and transhumanist types) are still thinking in terms of a
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; program that shuffles atoms using algorithms that any good programmer could
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; implement.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Not this transhumanist type.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; That is not even remotely realistic.  What they should be imagining is
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; something more like the FBI working over an especially important crime
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; scene, only with even more layers of specialized knowledge and processing.
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; The degree of expertise that can be applied to solving each particular
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; sub-problem (membrane reassembly, oxidation reversal, etc.) will grow
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; steadily over time, and it is difficult to say exactly where it will reach
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; its limits.
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
It will be reaching their limits asymptotically when the amount of
<BR>
extractable information about the original structure still contained
<BR>
in the artefact has been extracted. I hope this was clear enough.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM> &gt; What on Earth does an argument about the quality of current suspensions have
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; to do with the long-term stability of cryonics organizations?
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Nothing. However, an argument about attitudes about the quality of
<BR>
current suspensions on long-term stability of cryonics organizations
<BR>
does quite a lot.
<BR>
<P><EM> &gt; Actually, if you look back on this thread, you'll find that my original
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; remarks were directed against a post that argued this very point -
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; <A HREF="mailto:retroman@turbont.net?Subject=RE:%20Charles%20Platt%20responds%20to%20Billy%20Brown%20on%20CryoNet%20Message%20#13281&In-Reply-To=&lt;14523.29531.879110.842807@lrz.uni-muenchen.de&gt;">retroman@turbont.net</A> was claiming that the odds of not getting suspended at
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; all were high enough to constitute a valid reason for not bothering to sign
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; up.
</EM><BR>
<P>That's his personal calculus. If there was a 5-10% chance of being
<BR>
successfully suspended and ~100% chance of cryonics to work in
<BR>
principle I would have mailed my signup paperwork long time ago.
