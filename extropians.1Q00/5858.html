<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;But the only way to get funding for such research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;is to convince people that there money is better spent there  than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;somewhere else.  I just think we're going to have a heck of a time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;convincing people of that as long as there are things to spend money on 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;like feeding, healing and improving the standard of living of the 6
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;billion people we already share this planet with.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>No, there are two reasons anti-aging research &quot;sell&quot; works.
<BR>
1) Its in your personal self interest, in contrast to, feeding or
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;econ-lifting people you have never even met.  Even if you personally
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't want to live 1000 years, any relatively rational parent would
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;love their children to grow up in a world where they do not undergo
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ravages of aging.
<BR>
2) Its the right thing to do.  Investors who are relatively well off,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can and do make decisions based on investments that have moral value
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to them.  Witness the anti-tobacco or pro-environmental investing camps.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I don't think there's any such problem. We spend billions on research for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;diseases like Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, and prostate cancer, where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;result will only benefit old people in rich countries.
</EM><BR>
<P>We also spend billions on AIDS research, which, if we ever get a vaccine
<BR>
will help people in third world countries much more than it helps us.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;Much less gets spent on research for 3rd world food production.
</EM><BR>
<P>Precisely, because production *isn't* the problem.  Economic development,
<BR>
education and opportunities are.  There is a wealth of information about
<BR>
this at The Hunger Project (www.thp.org).  I've personally helped support
<BR>
their efforts for almost 20 years, to the tune of tens of thousands of
<BR>
dollars.  IMO, they are one of the most effective organisations working
<BR>
in this area.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;I don't see why
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;attitudes would be substantially different about longevity research, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;new way of benefitting old people in rich countries.
</EM><BR>
<P>Because ultimately, what you want is an anti-aging &quot;vaccine&quot;.
<BR>
That is a difficult problem but potentially feasible.  Then
<BR>
it would be available to anyone whether rich or poor.  And
<BR>
simple compound interest allows the poor to become rich over
<BR>
time (relative to their survival requirements).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I was replying to a message which suggested supporting longevity research as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; something that would benefit the rich first, then trickle down to mere 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mortals later.
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt it would develop entirely in this way.  I think there will
<BR>
be some technologies that are likely to remain expensive and some
<BR>
that will be quite cheap.  For example, replacing an organ that
<BR>
requires a human surgeon is probably going to be expensive.  But
<BR>
volume production of a small molecule that reverses protein
<BR>
glycosylation is likely to make that drug quite cheap.  And of course
<BR>
vaccines are relatively cheap due to the quantities manufactured.
<BR>
<P>The interesting thing about most genomics research is that
<BR>
things like stem cells, gene therapies, etc. when finally
<BR>
developed into workable technologies do not *have* to be
<BR>
expensive.  After you get some reasonable ROI on the R&amp;D,
<BR>
and constructing the factories, the cost of producing the
<BR>
therapies is of the order of the cost of the sugar to
<BR>
produce the cells, viruses, molecules, etc. required.  If the
<BR>
governments fund the R&amp;D and don't hand it off completely
<BR>
to the universities and industry where there is a profit agenda,
<BR>
then the therapies may be very inexpensive to provide.  This model
<BR>
has been successfully used in the past with many vaccines.
