<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt;Let me try another angle.  As someone pointed out, they are careful
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to never post anything that might become illegal at any time in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;future. This is exactly what might help defeat tyranny.  Any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;government can seize only those powers which *we allow to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;seized*.  If the masses lack foresight and a large percentage post
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that which might eventually become illegal, it provides the motive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;for those masses to prevent the government from making any form of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;speech or attitude illegal.  Right?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I don't put very much weight on methods to defeat tyranny that rely
<BR>
on &quot;mass&quot;-something, mass-movements, mass-media, etc. What I know
<BR>
best is my local environment, and the person that I can rely on the
<BR>
best is me. Therefore, my personal philosophy is to &quot;act locally&quot;
<BR>
and &quot;plant seeds&quot;. If I'm talking to someone about something that I
<BR>
like, or if I'm acting myself with no masks, and that particular
<BR>
idea or action takes root in the other person and flourishes, then
<BR>
great. If not, that's OK too. The last thing I wish is to be is an
<BR>
evangelist. Perhaps this perspective comes with age because I know
<BR>
that I was a much more active and vocal anarchist in my 20's than I
<BR>
am now.
<BR>
<P>I like the methods that help defeat tyranny that use the tyrant's
<BR>
own stupidity. In other words, methds that are &quot;smart&quot; and can be
<BR>
applied on a small scale.
<BR>
<P>I have a few heroes, people that I think are/were good at this
<BR>
method to fighting tyranny, as well as having other admirable
<BR>
traits,  and I will tell you about one. I will go into some length
<BR>
about him, because it ties together some of the threads regarding
<BR>
&quot;transparent society&quot;, &quot;recordings that persist for all time&quot;, as
<BR>
well as clever ways to foil tyranny and bureacracy.
<BR>
<P>His name is Krzysztof Kieslowski, and he was a Polish filmmaker. He
<BR>
died March 14, 1996, at age 55. You may have heard of some of his
<BR>
works. He was author of &quot;Decalog&quot;, &quot;Three Colours&quot;, and &quot;Double Life
<BR>
of Veronique&quot;, among many others. I've not seen all of his films and
<BR>
documentaries yet, but I've seen a good number of them. I recommend
<BR>
highly the book: _Kieslowski on Kieslowski_, which is a book of him
<BR>
talking about his own philosophy, his films and his life.
<BR>
<P>One of my favorite stories in the book is his description of making
<BR>
the film called &quot;No End&quot;. He (tried to make)/made the film starting
<BR>
in 1982, when martial law in Poland was in process for 1/2 year.
<BR>
Kieslowski got the idea of making a film indirectly about martial
<BR>
law (Kieslowski's films are always about people, but the politics of
<BR>
the times are often present), in particular, he wanted to make a
<BR>
movie that took place in the law courts. At that time, the courts
<BR>
were passing long sentences for trivial matters, such as two to
<BR>
three years for painting graffiti, for being caught with an
<BR>
underground newspaper, etc. His concept for the film would be to
<BR>
focus on two faces in the court: the &quot;accuser&quot; and the &quot;accused&quot;,
<BR>
which already had an irony because the &quot;accused&quot; was not really
<BR>
guilty of anything.
<BR>
<P>Kieslowski, after some long effort, got permission to shoot his
<BR>
movie in both public and military courts. The moment he started
<BR>
shooting, however, something strange happened. The judges didn't
<BR>
sentence the accused. They passed some sort of deferred sentences
<BR>
which weren't terrible at all. Kieslowski says that several reasons
<BR>
were behind this: 1) by the time he could start shooting, martial
<BR>
law was already less severe, and 2) the judges were simply fearful in
<BR>
front of the camera. They didn't want to be recorded at the moment
<BR>
of passing unjust sentences. They didn't like that this film would
<BR>
hold a permanent record of their action for 10 or 20 years. And they
<BR>
were afraid of seeing themselves on film. He said that it's one
<BR>
thing to sign a piece of paper and quite another thing to appear on
<BR>
screen at the moment of passing an unjust sentence.
<BR>
<P>Kieslowski, being the clever man that he was, began to use this new
<BR>
knowledge against the martial law system.
<BR>
<P>First, he found himself in great demand by the defendants to film
<BR>
their cases, because those defendants would surely get lighter
<BR>
sentences. So he did, and in fact, he needed to hire a second
<BR>
cameraman in order to make it on time to all of those trials. He
<BR>
spent about a month going from courtroom to courtroom, and &quot;filmed&quot;
<BR>
maybe 80 cases, in which was passed no sentences or a light
<BR>
sentences.
<BR>
<P>I put &quot;filmed&quot; in quotes, because Kieslowski wanted to make a movie
<BR>
filming the faces of the &quot;accuser&quot; and the &quot;accused&quot;, especially
<BR>
when the &quot;accuser&quot; was passing an unjust sentence. However, he saw
<BR>
no unjust sentences. In fact, in a short time, he concluded that it
<BR>
was useless to even load film in his cameras, so he and his hired
<BR>
help used dummy cameras in the courtrooms. He said that he used his
<BR>
dummy cameras to play on the judges' own fears of not wanting to
<BR>
pass unjust sentences on film.
<BR>
<P>Kieslowski eventually had to stop, because he wasn't getting
<BR>
anything on film, and he had to justify (and pay) for his hired
<BR>
help. He had some bad times immediately afterward too because he had
<BR>
to state in a letter to the Minstry of Arts and Culture why he
<BR>
didn't get anything on film, and there were some repercussions, but
<BR>
he recovered.
<BR>
<P>I like very much what Kieslowski did, and I wish very much that
<BR>
he were still alive. And find the book, it's fascinating reading.
<BR>
There are more descriptions in the book like this one.
