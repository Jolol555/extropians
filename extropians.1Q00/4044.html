</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, there were two author's who cowrote the book, Richard J.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Herrnstein and Charles Murray.  Herrnstein died shortly after the book was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; published.  He was seen by critics as not having the real research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experience to write the  book, though he was a Harvard trained psychologist.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I am quoting from two separate author's from the May 1995 (Volume 40, Number
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 5) issue of Contemporary Psychology, APA's journal of book reviews.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a quote from a book review by Donald Dorfman:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; One would presume that The Bell Curve represents Herrnstein's final summing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; up of a lifetime of objective scholarly research published in peer-reviewed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific journals on the genetic basis of IQ.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regrettably, the media seem to be totally unaware of the fact that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deceased Harvard professor never published any scientific research on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; genetic basis of IQ and its relation to race, poverty, or social class in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; peer-reviewed scientific journals in his entire 36-year academic career.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Richard Herrnstein's actual area of expertise is the experimental analysis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of decision making in pigeons and rats, and he never studied the genetic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; basis of any behavior in those laboratory animals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Regarding Charles Murray, Dorfman writes:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The second author of The Bell Curve, Charles Murray, has a doctorate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; political science from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; currently a Bradley Fellow with the American Enterprise Institute, a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; conservative research group in Washington, DC. Murray often publishes his
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research and theories in The Public Interest (e.g., Murray, 1994), a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neoconservative magazine edited by Irving Kristol, also a fellow of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American Enterprise Institute and sometimes considered the founding father
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of neoconservatism (Atlas, 1995).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In an article recently published in The Public Interest, Murray listed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first priority of his political agenda: &quot;And so I want to end welfare&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (1994, p. 18). Inasmuch as the media sometimes refer to The Bell Curve as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Murray's book, perhaps the book represents Murray's summing up of a body of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; objective scholarly research that he had published in scientific journals on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the genetic basis of IQ and poverty. But like his coauthor Richard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Herrnstein, Murray has never conducted or published any research in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; scientific journals on the genetic basis of IQ and poverty in his entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; career.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thought some background information on the co-authors would be helpful.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The following paragraph I think sums up the point Murray and Herrnstein's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; were trying to make with their book.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Thomas J. Bouchard, Jr. in his review of the book wrote:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The notion of a meritocracy is not, in itself, an affront to American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sensibilities. Social scientists have carefully documented that social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mobility does occur from one generation to the next and that cognitive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ability is a major factor in determining whether an individual will achieve
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; greater or lesser social status than did his or her parents (Waller, 1971).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; When each generation resorts in this way, the elements of fairness and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opportunity are preserved.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If, however, as The Bell Curve asserts, the heritability of IQ is quite high
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and there is a strong tendency for those similar in ability to marry, there
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; will be less regression toward the mean in the cognitive ability of children
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the intellectually talented and, therefore, less intergenerational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reassortment.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Under these circumstances a meritocracy begins to look like an aristocracy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a perception that is strongly reinforced when the intellectual elite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segregate themselves from the rest of society by living in separate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neighborhoods, sending their children to private schools, and supporting
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; social institutions that cater to their own unique interests.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The authors do argue that general cognitive ability (i.e., &quot;g&quot;) is a major
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determiner of social status and that variance in general mental ability is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; largely attributable to genetic factors--propositions that are certainly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; endorsed by many experts in the field. The book explicitly disclaims,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; however, that general mental ability is the only determinant of social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; status, or that g is the sum total of an individual's social worth.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is strong stuff!  I will requote the following:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Under these circumstances a meritocracy begins to look like an aristocracy,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a perception that is strongly reinforced when the intellectual elite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; segregate themselves from the rest of society by living in separate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; neighborhoods, etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<P>These guys Herrnstein and Murray remind me of Spencer and another guy with a
<BR>
funny little mustache. I can hear jacket booted goose steppers already! ;) Zieg
<BR>
Hiel Herr-nstein.
