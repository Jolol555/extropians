<P><EM>&gt; Parallel to the development of nano-tech assemblers are quantum computing

<EM>&gt; systems. I am wondering whether it is expected, or feasible, for nano-tech

<EM>&gt; assemblers to create quantum computers ?
</EM><BR>
<P>It is unclear (to me) at this time whether quantum computers have any uses
<BR>
other than for producing rapid solutions for a limited set of problems.
<BR>
I know of nothing that has equated a quantum computer to a turing machine,
<BR>
which if I recall can compute anything that is computable.
<BR>
[Someone correct me if this is wrong.]
<BR>
<P>Nano-assembly can build anything that can be assembled (a different problem
<BR>
from computed).  The current problem with quantum computers is that you
<BR>
need a bench full of equipment to get a couple of qubits.  Nanoassembly
<BR>
might shrink this somewhat but how much remains very unclear.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; For example, quantum computers could be created as stand alone entities
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in themselves, or they could be embedded within other media/materials. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
In the models I've seen so far you are always going to need some large
<BR>
amount of matter to create the necessary entangled quantum states that
<BR>
allow quantum computers to work.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In the latter case, consider the development of a reconfigurable life form,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; where the operating intelligence is distributed throughout the material.
</EM><BR>
<P>Distributed intelligence exists already, earthworms, I believe are examples.
<BR>
You could probably even say that bacteria operate this way.  I would argue
<BR>
that an amoeba is a fairly reconfigurable life form, though not in a very
<BR>
general purpose way since it can't disassemble and reassemble itself to
<BR>
be something different.  It may be true that ultimate reconfigurability
<BR>
is impossible (once you disassemble yourself into atoms its kind of
<BR>
hard to put them back in any way other than the few limited paths
<BR>
allowed by molecular forces).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; There is no central brain, as there is with existing life forms.
</EM><BR>
<P>But you want concentrated intelligence with low interCPU delay times
<BR>
and high interCPU bandwidth.  Eric's 1 cm^3 diamondoid rod-logic computer
<BR>
equal to 10^5-10^8 human brains is perfectly sufficient for this and operates
<BR>
on well known computer principles.
<BR>
<P>When someone can show me a quantum computer with as many effective
<BR>
bits as Eric's computer, that even using the measly power equivalent
<BR>
of the human brain(10W) is pushing through about 10^21 bits/second,
<BR>
then I'll consider them as potentially useful.
<BR>
<P>With QC, not only do you have the problem of how many bits it has,
<BR>
you also have the problem of the machine cycle time.  You may be able
<BR>
to get the answer out in nanoseconds, but it may take you hours to
<BR>
reset the machine so you can execute another &quot;instruction&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is Terminator 2 imagery obviously, but the science fiction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; looks like it could be created by the reality of nano-tech assembly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and quantum computing.
</EM><BR>
<P>T-2 can be created with standard nanotech, no QC required.
