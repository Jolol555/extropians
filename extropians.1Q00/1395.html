<P>
Here is a short summary of Howard Gardner's definition of personal or emotional
<BR>
intelligence, from Daniel Golemans book, Emotional Intelligence.
<BR>
<P>1. Knowing ones emotions.
<BR>
Recognizing a feeling as it happens- is the keystone of emotional intelligence.
<BR>
People with greater certainty about their feelings are better pilots of their
<BR>
lives,
<BR>
having a surer sense of how they really feel about personal decisions from whom
<BR>
to
<BR>
marry to what job to take.
<BR>
<P>2. Managing emotions.
<BR>
Handling feelings so they are appropriate. The capacity to soothe oneself, shake
<BR>
off
<BR>
rampant anxiety, gloom, or irritability. People who are poor in this ability are
<BR>
constantly battling feelings of distress, while those who excel in it can bounce
<BR>
back
<BR>
far more quickly from life's setbacks and upsets.
<BR>
<P>3. Motivating oneself.
<BR>
Marshaling emotions in the service of a goal is essential for paying attention,
<BR>
for
<BR>
self-motivation and mastery, and for creativity. Emotional self-control,
<BR>
delaying
<BR>
gratification and stifling impulsiveness underlies accomplishment of every sort.
<BR>
Being able to get into the &quot;flow&quot; state enables outstanding performance of all
<BR>
kinds.
<BR>
People who have this skill tend to be more highly productive and effective in
<BR>
whatever they undertake.
<BR>
<P>4. Recognizing emotions in others.
<BR>
Empathy, another ability that builds on emotional self-awareness, is the
<BR>
fundamental
<BR>
&quot;people skill.&quot; People who are emphatic are more attuned to the subtle social
<BR>
signals
<BR>
that indicate what others need or want. This makes them better at callings such
<BR>
as
<BR>
the caring professions, teaching, sales, and management.
<BR>
<P>5. Handling relationships.
<BR>
The art of relationships is, in large part, skill in managing emotions in
<BR>
others. These
<BR>
are the abilities that undergird popularity, leadership, and interpersonal
<BR>
effectiveness. People who excel in these skills do well at anything that relies
<BR>
on
<BR>
interacting smoothly with others; they are social stars.

<P><P><P><EM>&gt;&gt;It would be wonderful to have more control over one's
</EM><BR>
emotional life. (However, I would tend to crank the volume
<BR>
up, not down.&lt;&lt;
<BR>
<P>Would this increase one's emotional intelligence?
<BR>
<P>Note: The buzz word emotional intelligence is an idea I've
<BR>
only seen on the bookshelf and hadn't put aside enough time
<BR>
to read up on yet.
<BR>
<P>Anyone familiar with emotional intelligence?
