<EM>&gt; &gt; I don't know how much those of you else where, especially on the left coast,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; have heard about the landmark new domestic partners bill just passed by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Vermont Legislature.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [snip]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; My interest in this is the opposite directions that Vermont and California
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seem to be going in.  This would seem to give us a preview of the potential
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;enclaves&quot; that may develop in terms of use of nanotech, biotech, medtech,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; privacy, etc.  The question becomes -- would the people in Vermont view
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the situation in California as a sufficient violation of human rights
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as to go to war over it?  Or is it entirely in the legal/governmental
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; realms?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Perhaps its a good thing that Vermont &amp; California are on opposite coasts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is however, completely suprising to me (as a conservative &quot;Yankee&quot;),
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that *Vermont* is going to the liberal side and those wacky Californians
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are going to the conservative side of this debate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Those of us on the western border of New Hampshire have always noticed how much
<BR>
more left wing and socialist Vermont is compared to New Hampshire and Maine. It
<BR>
seems to be partly due to the massive influx of commune types in th 60's and 70's,
<BR>
but also a lot of denizens of New York who got sufficiently sick of where things
<BR>
were heading 5-15 years ago, but were both unwilling to adopt the 'mugged
<BR>
democrat' conservative attitudes, or were wealthy enough to escape things, and
<BR>
Vermont is always a good escape for tax plagued New Yorkers. There is a
<BR>
significant gay and lesbian population in Vermont, and the gay pride parade in
<BR>
Burlington, and the lesbian pride parades in Brattleboro (sans tops), are regular
<BR>
head turners.
<BR>
<P>Of course, Vermont has the only Socialist member of Congress (Bernie Sanders, an
<BR>
escapee from Brooklyn, and former mayor of Burlington, and publicly he is an
<BR>
'indpendent', but that was a change he made only when he was in congress).
<BR>
<P>Of course, Vermont has its own wackiness in many ways to rival California. Can you
<BR>
imagine a state that not only recognises gay rights but also says you don't need a
<BR>
permit to carry a concealed weapon? It seems California is the opposite of Vermont
<BR>
on more than just gay rights issues...
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Can the non-U.S. members of the list weigh in on trends in their countries?
