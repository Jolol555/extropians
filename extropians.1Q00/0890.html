<P>The first useful artificial eye is now helping a blind man walk safely around 
<BR>
and read large letters, researchers said on Monday. 
<BR>
<P>The 62-year-old man, identified only as Jerry, demonstrated that he was able 
<BR>
to collect a black hat off a white wall, then locate a mannequin and place 
<BR>
the hat on its head. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The specks inside the box are what Jerry sees
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Jerry, blinded by an accident at the age of 36, does not see an image but up 
<BR>
to 100 specks of light that appear and disappear as his field of vision 
<BR>
shifts. The specks show up the edges of objects. The constellation of dots, 
<BR>
called phosphenes, has been likened to stars that glitter and fade behind 
<BR>
passing clouds. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;He can do remarkably well,&quot; said William Dobelle, chairman of the Dobelle 
<BR>
Institute, the US medical device company that has developed the system. 
<BR>
<P>Richard Normann, an artificial vision expert at the University of Utah, 
<BR>
stressed that the device is &quot;a very limited navigational aid, and a far cry 
<BR>
from the visual experience that normal people enjoy&quot;. 
<BR>
<P>However he added that the work suggests that even limited signals to the 
<BR>
brain will let blind people do relatively complicated visual tasks. 
<BR>
<P>'Major step forward' 
<BR>
<P>Dr Bill Heetderks, director of a US National Institutes of Health program to 
<BR>
develop electronic implants that work with the brain, believes an implant 
<BR>
that helps blind people navigate would be a major step forward. 
<BR>
<P>&quot;When Dr Dobelle provides additional details on his methodology that 
<BR>
establishes this result, we may be there,&quot; Dr Heetderks said. The device and 
<BR>
its performance are described in the January/February issue of the American 
<BR>
Society of Artificial Internal Organs Journal. 
<BR>
<P>The artificial vision system works by taking an image from a miniature 
<BR>
television camera and distance information from an ultrasound sensor, each of 
<BR>
which is mounted on one lens of a pair of sunglasses. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<P><P><P>These signals are processed by a five-kilogram (10 pounds) portable computer 
<BR>
and then a new signal is sent to 68 platinum electrodes implanted in the 
<BR>
person's brain. The electrodes are on the surface of the brain's visual 
<BR>
cortex and stimulate the person to 'see' the phosphenes. 
<BR>
<P>Jerry has recognised five-centimetre-tall (two inches) letters from 1.5 
<BR>
metres (five feet) away, said Dr Dobelle. The device provides 'tunnel 
<BR>
vision', with the field of view being equivalent to a card 20 cm tall by five 
<BR>
centimetres wide (eight by two inches) held at arm's length. 
<BR>
<P>Despite this, Dr Dobelle said that Jerry had been able to navigate in 
<BR>
unfamiliar environments including the New York City subway system. He added 
<BR>
that by replacing the camera with a special electronic interface, Jerry was 
<BR>
also learning to use a computer. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The computer software detects the edges of objects
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
Jerry, along with another volunteer, had the electrodes implanted in his 
<BR>
brain in 1978. Since then the computer used has shrunk in size and the 
<BR>
software improved. 
<BR>
<P>One aspect of future development will focus on how best to provide depth 
<BR>
perception - during the demonstration Jerry had to walk cautiously as he 
<BR>
approached the mannequin and the wall, holding out an arm to prevent 
<BR>
collisions. 
<BR>
<P>Dr Dobelle said a version of the device should go on sale outside the US 
<BR>
later this year.
