</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To be fair to Christians I will say that the majority would see nanotech as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a great boon for humanity which would eventually be perverted by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;antichrist who would use it in his bid for world domination.  I don't see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;militant antagonism from mainstream Christianity, such as has occured over
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;abortion.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there would initially be an outcry from the Christian fringe.  But 
<BR>
eventually it would probably quiet down.  I remember reading some Christian 
<BR>
propaganda about 20 years ago warning the faithful about the dangers of 
<BR>
computers and raising a ruckus about the fact that there was a supercomputer 
<BR>
in Europe nick-named &quot;The Beast.&quot;  Later the big scare was UPC codes as 
<BR>
precursors to the prophesied &quot;mark of the beast.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Eventually the panic died down and now that everything you buy has UPC codes 
<BR>
on it Christians are as big consumers as any other segment in the US.  Also, 
<BR>
any televangelist worth his holy collection plate now has his own web site.  
<BR>
So much for the holy technophobes.
