<EM>&gt; &gt;Big Borther, and all of your neighbors, are watching you....Now you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;really feel free now, right? &quot;Slavery is freedom.&quot; Yup thats 'real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;freedom' alright.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Well no.  No one is watching me now, at least not very closely (at least not
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; that I'm aware of).  And of course, to the extent that I am being watched 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right now, it does not give me any sense of freedom.  But the reason for 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that is that the &quot;watching&quot; is not *mutual*.  Mutuality is the key to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; freedom in a transparent society.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would say &quot;voluntary&quot;.  Making something voluntary means freedom to me.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, if there are no secrets, there can be no secret keys, right?
<BR>
So how do you authenticate data streams?  You rely on continuous
<BR>
monitoring of the emplaced data streaming equipment to make sure it
<BR>
doesn't get subverted, but surely there must be some points of
<BR>
susceptibility along the transmission routes.
<BR>
<P>Here's another thought: assume humans radiate outward either
<BR>
spherically from earth, or at least in a circle from earth across the
<BR>
plane of the ecliptic.  Are the ones at the edge supposed to bring the
<BR>
surveillance with them and beam it back to earth?
<BR>
<P>OK, maybe you bribe them, as they go to the edges of human
<BR>
civilization, by proposing an exchange -- as they go to the edges,
<BR>
they should take the surveillance with them, in exchange for having
<BR>
access to the earth's surveillance net.  If so, how do you protect
<BR>
yourself from their spoofing you?  They set up a phony data stream
<BR>
back.  Soon, they're watching you, but you're not watching them.
<BR>
Repeat at the various edge points, and soon you have info spoofing
<BR>
warfare directed at the people of earth, hereafter referred to as &quot;the
<BR>
suckers&quot;.  Once the people back home (the suckers) realize what's
<BR>
happening, they're encircled by the spoofers.  The suckers have
<BR>
already made themselves completely transparent, so they can't as
<BR>
easily spoof all the mutually confirming outbound streams, but bit by
<BR>
bit individuals could contemptuously and openly shut them off, taking
<BR>
the whole scheme down in a paroxysm of mutual distrust.
<BR>
<P>I think as surveillance grows, we will come to accept the notion that
<BR>
people will have to explicitly build surveillance clean environments.
<BR>
Nano-sealed for your protection, and the public/private distinction
<BR>
will become more stark.  I don't believe a panopticon is the way.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; But you miss the point, transparency is not about treating people as 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; prisoners.  It's about treating people as family (which when you think about
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; it is what they are).  I know almost everything about my wife.  Her 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; finances, her hopes, her fears, her weaknesses, her strengths.  I know 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; exactly how she'll react if I kiss the backs of her knees.  I know where she
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; is almost all the time.  Does that make her my prisoner?  Especially when 
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>How does that scale with n+1 nodes and (n**2 + n)/2, that is O(n**2)
<BR>
unique interconnections?
<BR>
<P>Hint: poorly.
<BR>
<P>All the best,
