<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; How about this scenario.  Nanoassemblers are developed and the decision
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; made to let the public benefit from them.  But in order to be issued a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; nanobox of your very own, you must first agree to have your every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; interaction with any other human, computer or nanodevice recorded and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; publicly stored.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; So you have your choice, to be surveilled or not.  Curious: Which would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; *you* choose?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;This is another scenario that is only possible if you already have an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;authoritarian government - and in this case it has to control the whole
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;world, not just one part of it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;In a free society there is no entity that has the power to compel me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;sign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;any particular agreement in order to gain access to nanotech.  I can buy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;from Zyvex, or Nanotech Industries, or the Japanese, or anyone else who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;technology to sell.  The odds of there being a monopoly (or even a small
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;pool of vendors) for very long are just about nil.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Odds are, since nanotech will be even *more* dangerous than nuclear weapons,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; access to it will be guarded just as tightly as nuclear weapon access is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; now.  Have you tried to buy a nuclear weapon lately?  Is the reason that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cannot because you live under the thumb of an authoritarian government?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes it is. Otherwise, I'd have built my own nuclear propulsion sytem and
<BR>
been off this brick.
<BR>
<P>Your contention that nanotech would be more dangerous than nukes is pure
<BR>
speculation, and your assumptions that the human race, after another
<BR>
century of development after nuclear power was first developed, had not
<BR>
become more mature (or that the lowest common denominator that could
<BR>
afford such technology would be worse than, say, Kruschev, Stalin,
<BR>
Brezhnev, Eisenhower, or Ronald Reagan). Your continual capacity to
<BR>
think the absolute worst of your fellow human beings continually amazes
<BR>
me, then again, considering how hypocritical you are, in that you only
<BR>
think that everyone else needs to be transparent, not you. Still won't
<BR>
identify yourself, eh? What do you have to hide? If you think so poorly
<BR>
of your fellow man, it must be because you are such a rough specimin
<BR>
yourself that you cannot show your own face to the light of day, but you
<BR>
cannot imagine that anyone else on this poor planet could be any better
<BR>
than you. What are you hiding?????
