<EM>&gt; &gt;I've seen enough hateful cartoons about the NRA that one more is no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;surprise.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Can there be enough hateful cartoons about an organization that fights to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; keep more guns than people in circulation?
</EM><BR>
<P>You have a point? Don't even try to start a gun rights flame war with
<BR>
me. Facts are that guns are what keeps as many people in this country in
<BR>
circulation as possible. Proven fact, undeniable. Largest statistical
<BR>
database examined to date (and the most unbiased one). I can also retort
<BR>
that there should be more hateful cartoons about people and groups that
<BR>
think that law abiding citizens have no right to defend their lives
<BR>
against criminals. Do you really want to continue?
