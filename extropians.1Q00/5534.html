<P>
Each one of us has conflicts in our own minds about
<BR>
various subjects. No one has the time to think long
<BR>
and hard about each and every issue and decide on a
<BR>
position on each. Some issues are &quot;no-brainers&quot;, but
<BR>
some are very hard to decide. So, it is natural to
<BR>
have conflicts in our minds. We accept this. It
<BR>
doesn't bother us if we are &quot;of two minds&quot; on a few
<BR>
issues, even many issues, especially if the issues are
<BR>
non-vital and/or you aren't somehow forced to choose a
<BR>
position on them.
<BR>
<P>I would even say that it's a sign of a healthy mind to
<BR>
have some internal mental conflicts. It's a sign of
<BR>
mental &quot;balance&quot;. I would be pretty worried about
<BR>
someone who seemed to have unshakeable positions on
<BR>
EVERY single issue life presents us with.
<BR>
<P>I would further say that the same can be said of
<BR>
societies. This is pretty obvious, so I won't go into
<BR>
much detail, but it is natural to have in societies
<BR>
people who disagree on various subjects. An analogy
<BR>
can be drawn between debates that occur in societies
<BR>
and internal debates in a person's mind. It would be
<BR>
pretty scary to have a large society that agrees 100%
<BR>
all of the time; in fact, we would simply not believe
<BR>
it, and see claims for such unanimity as a sign of
<BR>
false government propaganda.
<BR>
<P>When someone expresses an opinion I consider extremist
<BR>
and stupid, (as happens often on this list) I
<BR>
sometimes remind myself that societies NEED
<BR>
extremists. They're part of the natural order; the
<BR>
debates they engender strengthen societies and
<BR>
exercise our minds. Their presence helps to keep
<BR>
societies balanced. Hell, sometimes the extremist are
<BR>
even RIGHT.
<BR>
<P>As a hypothetical example, imagine a person confronted
<BR>
by the opinions of , oh, let's say an &quot;anarchist&quot;,
<BR>
opinions which he/she thinks are silly and wrong.
<BR>
<P>Before responding, the person could think to
<BR>
himself/herself like this:
<BR>
<P>&quot;Anarchists&quot;, he/she thinks, &quot;are just extreme kinds
<BR>
of libertarians. They are foolish because they espouse
<BR>
the impossible, but so what? What's the harm? No
<BR>
society will ever actually BE an anarchy; there is too
<BR>
much benefit to be gained from organizing good
<BR>
governmental systems. If 'anarchies' were superior,
<BR>
they would already exist; their very absence is proof
<BR>
that they are obviously inferior in an evolutionary
<BR>
sense. So, even though this person is obviously
<BR>
deluded, his opinions will only serve to remind us of
<BR>
the importance of respecting individual rights as a
<BR>
way of minimizing the inevitable tryanny of the
<BR>
majority.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&quot;Yes,&quot; the hypothetical person could go on thinking,
<BR>
&quot;although it's humourous to me how this person seems
<BR>
to think that the concept of 'tryanny of the majority'
<BR>
is somehow new and profound, when the framers of the
<BR>
U.S. Constitution knew about it over way back in the
<BR>
1700's, and set of the Bill of Rights to help mitigate
<BR>
the problem, I will still refrain from responding.
<BR>
There's a small chance that this person's obsession
<BR>
might someday help us to find new and better ways to
<BR>
protect the rights of the individual and still have
<BR>
societies where people are protected from harm by
<BR>
other people.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Again, this is just an hypothetical example.
<BR>
<P>&quot;This reminds me&quot;, the imaginary person could continue
<BR>
thinking, &quot;of the way so many people misunderstand the
<BR>
word 'anarchy'. For example, 'Freenet' is NOT 'a
<BR>
perfect anarchy', as it's proponents describe it,
<BR>
because EACH NODE FOLLOWS RULES. It's a 'perfect
<BR>
egalitarianism' because each node is equal. It's hard
<BR>
to imagine how a a computer network could be a
<BR>
'perfect anarchy'. Well,&quot; the theoretical person could
<BR>
think with a grin, &quot; a BROKEN one could, I guess. I
<BR>
wonder if this anarchist really knows what anarchy
<BR>
means: No rules. Therefore, no rights.&quot;
<BR>
<P>Then, the pretend person of undetermined gender could
<BR>
get hungry and think, &quot;What's for dinner?&quot;
<BR>
