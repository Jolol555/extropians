<P>The only analysis done of ALL statistics in the database done was by
<BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;Professor John Lott of the University of Chicago. He found the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;following, based completely on the statistics:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;a) For every 1% increase in the number of citizens with Concealed Carry
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;permits, crime drops by an average of 1%.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;b) The death penalty, as it is currently administered, has no positive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;or negative effect on the crime rate.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;c) Violent crime drops by an average of 8% one year after a state passes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;a 'shall-issue' reform of its concealed carry statues (versus
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;discretionary issue statutes).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;d) Spree type killings (more than one murder per incident) drop by an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;average of 80% within 5 years of passage of such concealed carry laws.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;he found a bunch of other things out, but these are the most salient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;points. Read his book, _More Guns, Less Crime_ before you dismiss this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;So when you *said* &quot;FBI Database of Crime Statistics&quot; what you *meant* was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;_More Guns, Less Crime_?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;And I don't suppose you would agree that John Lott is an avowed right-wing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;pro-gun lobbyist who wouldn't know the truth if it slapped him with a wet 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;noodle?
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't wish to further fuel this fire, but John Lott started as a skeptic 
<BR>
on the subject of gun ownership, and was convinced by his research to take 
<BR>
the opposite view. Statistics for Florida and Texas speak for themselves, 
<BR>
as do the recent reports from &quot;gun free&quot; Great Britain and Australia.
<BR>
<P>Victim disarmament will only create more victims.
