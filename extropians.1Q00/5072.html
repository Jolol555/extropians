<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In a free capitalist society shouldn't an individual profit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their hard won intellectual efforts?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No.  In a free capitalist society, people should profit from the free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exchange of goods or services with other individuals, or any other
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; freely entered profitable contract or dealing.  By contrast, if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obtain a patent, you prevent me, via a state granted monopoly on a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular implementation of an idea, from using my own intelligence,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; labor and industry to similarly profit.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is that it is pretty difficult for the second guy to prove
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; he never had any input from the first.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; How is that my problem?  That does not justify using the machinery of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the state to prohibit me from using my own intelligence and labor as I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; see fit.  That's what your use of a patent to restrict me does.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, it doesn't. You can even go to the patent office, buy a copy of the paten
</EM><BR>
t
<BR>
<EM>&gt; file, take it home, and build the device or whatever. Its perfectly legal, yo
</EM><BR>
u
<BR>
<EM>&gt; don't owe anybody anything, you just can't make money off of the other guy's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes.  That's what I call &quot;prohibiting me from using my own
<BR>
intelligence and labor as I see fit.&quot;  A still clearer example is if I
<BR>
independently derive the same implementation but lose the race to the
<BR>
patent office (or simply don't consider patenting the thing) and am
<BR>
prohibited from profiting.  There is no justice in such a prohibition.
<BR>
Not an iota, scintilla, jot nor hint of it, and you cannot add it back
<BR>
by hoping for it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The presumption is that once one person has had an original idea and its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been published, the 'land' occupied by that idea in the world of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; memespace  ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Patents don't cover ideas.  Any IP lawyer will tell you that.  Patents
<BR>
cover implementations.  There has to be an implementation, and *only*
<BR>
that particular implemented technique is covered.  No fundamental
<BR>
algorithms or ideas are covered. 
<BR>
<P>Do you see the rhyme or reason here?  I surely don't.
<BR>
<P>Anyway, the important thing about inventions is that your analogy
<BR>
breaks down.  Ideas are not like land, where only one person may
<BR>
possess it for certain kinds of use.  Implementations of ideas may be
<BR>
profitably used by a theoretically unlimited number of persons, thus
<BR>
there is no justification for granting property rights in them, unless
<BR>
those rights entirely arise from voluntary contractual dealings among
<BR>
persons.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; has now been claimed and is being developed,  ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Ah, but patents do not show and cannot show exclusive development.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and that this meme now exists as an entity in society, ...
</EM><BR>
<P>As far as some particular group of bureaucrats are concerned.  This is
<BR>
no basis for property.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; so it is not possible to call any other invention of the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea as original, unless you can somehow prove that you never had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been exposed
</EM><BR>
<P>It is you and the statists who have invented this property right.  I
<BR>
do not think it is fair to burden the people who believe in liberty
<BR>
with proving non-infringement of it.  Instead, you should prove that
<BR>
this property right will not infringe liberty, which you cannot do.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; to that idea or its offshoots before.. If you think that you have an equal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 'right of access' to that memespace, then you are no better than a socialist 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who is against property rights.  ...
</EM><BR>
<P>Everyone has a right of access to the memespace.  Your wish to enclose
<BR>
it does not make your enclosure right.  It is particularly noxious
<BR>
because the enclosure serves only to create a right to a monopoly,
<BR>
when there is no need for a monopoly for the inventor to profit.  The
<BR>
inventor has several avenues for profiting exclusively, at least for a
<BR>
time.  The inventor, to name one, could exhibit the practical
<BR>
advantages of his or her invention without disclosing the details, and
<BR>
solicit bids for manufacturing rights from a number of competing
<BR>
manufacturers, handing over future development of the invention to a
<BR>
standards body.  This can be quite profitable, and secure a place for
<BR>
the invention that requires no coercion, just voluntary dealings with
<BR>
other individuals.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Moreover, under what theory of rights do you obtain exclusive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ownership of a technology just because you were first?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The same theory of rights that grants a land patent to a homesteader
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who stakes the first claim on that undeveloped land. ...
</EM><BR>
<P>The numerous means of staking a claim in property date back with the
<BR>
earliest civilizations and have a basis in the nature of human
<BR>
interactions.  Hume, I think, gives a good work up of them.  We have
<BR>
such things as legitimate purchase, adverse possession, mixing use
<BR>
with a thing (development), discovery, creation, etc.  Human
<BR>
civilization depends on these, and socialists to the contrary, all
<BR>
societies in some ways have depended on them in everyday life.  Even
<BR>
the socialist societies merely stole property and handed it over to
<BR>
the tyranny.  
<BR>
<P>We need no state intervention to tell us about these rights, and we
<BR>
have the whole history of humanity  to help us in figuring out the
<BR>
application of the principles to specific instances.
<BR>
<P>Not a single one of these principles directly applies to patents.
<BR>
<P>Patents grant as property *a monopoly right to profit from a
<BR>
particular implementation of an idea*.  Though I may have created
<BR>
the implementation, I did not create the ability to profit from it --
<BR>
I contributed, perhaps to others' ability to profit from it, depending
<BR>
on how easy I made it for them to discern the idea.
<BR>
<P>But there is no proving that someone else might not have gotten to the
<BR>
implementation.   
<BR>
<P>In any case, further profit will depend on *canny application* of the
<BR>
labor, investment, improvement, marketing, etc. to the particular
<BR>
implementation technique.  By no natural, voluntary human interactions
<BR>
can that be monopolized.
<BR>
<P>Only the state can create such a monopoly right.
<BR>
<P>The limited term of the patent demonstrates the extreme artificiality
<BR>
of such a right.  Imagine all property rights on land took the form of
<BR>
17-year leases, at which point the land entered the public domain.
<BR>
Our civilization would collapse.  Or, more correctly, the laws would
<BR>
be overthrown and a natural theory of land ownership would return,
<BR>
perhaps in a cataclysm.
<BR>
<P>The monopoly right to profit from an implementation based on first
<BR>
registration of the invention is, by contrast, a complete superfluity,
<BR>
imposed by bureaucrats.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Only one in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which rights derive from state grants.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No, state grants are derived from the concept that the state is entrusted by 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the people with unclaimed land that is assumed to belong to all, to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; disburse it in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fair portions as developers seek to claim and develop that land.
</EM><BR>
<P>We need no state ownership of land to derive title.  Title can arise
<BR>
from purely voluntary human interactions in accords with the
<BR>
principles that our civilization has worked out.  We need no state for
<BR>
all fair property rights.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; We all routinely benefit from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; civilization and nobody makes us pay.  I'm typing in a house that has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; central heating.  I enjoy this but I haven't paid the inventor of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; houses or furnaces.  What a calamity!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Since patents do not last in perpetuity, 
</EM><BR>
<P>And why not?
<BR>
<P>If patents are a real property right, why are you not leading or joining
<BR>
in a massive revolt against the tyrranical society which confiscates
<BR>
that property after only 17 years?
<BR>
<P>Because in your heart you know I'm right.  
<BR>
<P>Patents are an unearned gift of the coercive power of the state to
<BR>
enable you to monopolize.  Better not to push the claim further and
<BR>
risk losing it altogether.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; and houses and central heating date
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; back to the time of early civilization, the memes of 'house' and 'central
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heating' have become fair use technologies.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>No such ephemeral, changeable right can possibly have a basis in
<BR>
principles of justice.  Compare, as you like to do, with land: how
<BR>
much land has reverted by fair use to the public domain?  How much is
<BR>
now owned privately?  Obviously, land goes to private hands more and
<BR>
more down through the ages, because it is a real property right, not
<BR>
the creation of the nation statists.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In what way does this justify the state's stepping in and assigning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ownership of a technology?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because once an inventor has published his invention to the general
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; public, then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; its not possible for another person to be able to claim that they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had originated
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that idea subsequently, so it was not actually a new creation of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that person's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mind, but a recycling of an existing idea.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are assuming the justice of the principle -- first registration of
<BR>
implementation grants monopoly right to profit.  I'm asking for the
<BR>
derivation of the justice in this.
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Deal freely with other people, or are you afraid to do so and have to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; call in the nanny state to help?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In a society where not many people seem to think that others should be paid a
</EM><BR>
s
<BR>
<EM>&gt; fairly for their honest work as they themselves would like to be, and where
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; concepts of integrity and honesty have nearly lost their meaning, either have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the state do it, or let me start enforcing the old codes of honor and integri
</EM><BR>
ty
<BR>
<EM>&gt; as it used to be done.
</EM><BR>
<P>What, do you want to reintroduce dueling?  Or perhaps you mean the
<BR>
integrity and honesty that prevailed during the era of slavery in the
<BR>
U.S.?  During the time of feudalism, with its droits du seigneurs?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Only a gullible dupe would blindly trust everyone without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; protection like you seem to.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have protection in that I have contracts, and I know how to get them
<BR>
enforced.  My dealings with my customers have been characterized by
<BR>
straightforwardness and clarity, because we're very explicit about
<BR>
what we want from each other from the word go.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; the original device from the original inventor, are they really an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; inventor, or just a cheap shallow crook with no consideration for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; others?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Is it theft to learn from others' ideas?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is theft, plagiarism, and basically dishonest to use another's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ideas without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; credit and requested recompense. If you don't understand this basic concept,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then I have no basis to trust you either. Men who do not understand honor 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have no honor.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are citing important principles, but you are not defining them
<BR>
precisely, and thus you apply them incorrectly.  
<BR>
<P>It is plagiarism to pass another's expressions of ideas off as your
<BR>
own.  This is dishonorable, and can be illegal in some instances,
<BR>
according to principles that might in some cases naturally arise from
<BR>
contractual arrangements between persons.
<BR>
<P>Dishonesty comes from representing things falsely.  There is
<BR>
altogether too much of it in the world.  It may or may not be legal,
<BR>
depending on considerations too complex to describe here.
<BR>
<P>Theft means intentionally taking another's property.  This is one of
<BR>
the most common crimes.  Civilization unites to deplore and punish it.
<BR>
<P>Using another's ideas without credit is dishonorable if the idea has
<BR>
not entered the sphere of common knowledge.  For example, I mentioned
<BR>
Hume earlier as my source for thinking about property rights, but my
<BR>
honor would be no less had I not done so, since the ideas are the
<BR>
common heritage of humanity at this point.
<BR>
<P>Using another's ideas without requested recompense may or may not be
<BR>
dishonest, fraudulent or even theft depending entirely on whether the
<BR>
person doing so is representing falsely and depending on the
<BR>
originator's just basis for claiming the right to control the profit
<BR>
from the idea.  This is not an easy claim.  The person may be in error
<BR>
in claiming originiation of the idea.  The idea may have been obvious.
<BR>
The idea may have been inevitable.  The idea may have been readily
<BR>
independently derivable even if not obvious.  And finally, the idea
<BR>
may be justly obtainable through other avenues (persons not bound to
<BR>
secrecy).
<BR>
<P>Therefore, humanity has traditionally correctly refused to enter this
<BR>
morass and establish property rights in monopolizing particular
<BR>
implementations of ideas, until the rise of the cult of the omnipotent
<BR>
nation state, at which point the state felt free to enter all our
<BR>
lives and micromanage the details down to the color of our socks and
<BR>
how many cookies we may eat each day.  The old, traditional way was
<BR>
not dishonorable -- far from it, it was realistic -- though particular
<BR>
actors may have been.  Unfortunately, a just society cannot expunge
<BR>
all dishonor.
<BR>
<P>One way for inventors to establish some sort of property rights until
<BR>
the cat is out of the bag is to establish secrecy or non-disclosure
<BR>
agreements to get the enterprise started.  There is a fine tradition
<BR>
of doing just this.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Maybe the original inventor should have made the person in question
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sign an NDA.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A patent is a societal NDA.
</EM><BR>
<P>Don't give me Rousseau and your social contracts!
<BR>
<P>I don't recognize your social contracts.  Lysander Spooner speaks for
<BR>
me on this topic in &quot;The Constitution of No Authority&quot;.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; If I invented the automobile, and I made every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person who bought a car from me sign an NDA, I would also have to require tha
</EM><BR>
t
<BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone they ever showed the car to to sign an NDA as well. How feasible is th
</EM><BR>
at?
<BR>
<P>Maybe the infeasibilty should help demonstrate the unnatural and
<BR>
tyrannical nature of the property right you seek?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; That is the main reason why using only contract law to protect intellectual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; property fails, and why patents were created to redress that need.
</EM><BR>
<P>Patents were created for the crown to license particular merchants to
<BR>
produce goods, as a revenue generating scheme in England.  In the
<BR>
U.S. the more rights-conscious founders expressed the principle
<BR>
differently -- to further the useful arts and sciences or some such.
<BR>
<P>No society bases IP on a natural propery rights foundation.  This is a
<BR>
modern myth.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Nah, that would require the inventor to actually work hard to protect
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this right.  Better for the state to just give her a handout, right?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; As opposed to letting everyone else steal her ideas? 
</EM><BR>
<P>As I said before, any IP lawyer worth her salt will tell you that
<BR>
patents are not ownership of ideas.
<BR>
<P>Say it loud, say it proud:
<BR>
<P>Patents are not ownership of ideas!
<BR>
<P>Again:
<BR>
<P>Patents are not ownership of ideas!
<BR>
<P>The law takes pains to ensure that patents are not ownership of ideas.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Enforcing the law and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mandating that members of soceity operate honestly is not a handout, it is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justice.
</EM><BR>
<P>Mandating that members of society operate honestly is a tyranny more
<BR>
exacting than any tyranny undertaken by any state ever.  I wish you no
<BR>
luck in your utopian tyrannical dreams.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is coercive, oppressive and destructive, as well as against
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberty.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sounds like the anarcho-socialist argument against property.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You are mistaken.  The parallel is entirely in your head.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; In this case it is you who are arguing for the omnipotent state to act
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as the arbiter of property, and it is I who am arguing for free
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; trade.  You are taking the socialist line here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; No I am not. The anarcho-socialist argument is that property rights don't exi
</EM><BR>
st
<BR>
<EM>&gt; because they infringe on other individuals 'right of free access'. Opponents 
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; patents are using the same principle with original ideas. Just as there is a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limit to the amount of land on the planet, once you've sold one piece of land
</EM><BR>
,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; you cant sell it again to someone else, once a person has had an original ide
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; and it has been published publicly, then it is not possible for someone else 
</EM><BR>
to
<BR>
<EM>&gt; have originated that idea. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Patents are not ownership of ideas!
<BR>
<P>Patents are *monopoly rights*.  
<BR>
<P>Why does origination grant monopoly rights?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Given a finite universe, there are a finite number of ideas.
</EM><BR>
<P>We will run out of time before we run out of useful implementations.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; However patent protection makes sure that EVERY user of your invention
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; pays his fair share,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The universal sign of the socialist argument!  Let the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; decide what is &quot;fair&quot; and redistribute the wealth accordingly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The government does NOT decide what is fair, the market decides what the fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; value of a particular patent is. All the government does is make sure that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everyone who uses that idea actually pays for it what the market determines i
</EM><BR>
t
<BR>
<EM>&gt; is worth.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's try an experiment.  Eliminate all government patent mechanisms.
<BR>
<P>Then let's see how the market deals with this &quot;property right&quot;, shall we?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; No thanks, I prefer free dealing.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Free stealing you mean.
</EM><BR>
<P>You are assuming what you have yet to prove, a legitimate property
<BR>
right.  Slander my case all you want, it doesn't make you right.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; which is not the case currently with software,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; where you have between 20-50% piracy rates.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Does the existence of burglary justify the government deciding who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; owns which houses and doling them out in arbitrary 17 year periods to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; whoever can claim them first?  Please take your statist schemes elsewhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The existence of burglary justifies the government:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a) allowing homeowners to shoot intruders
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; b) making it a crime to break and enter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; c) hiring police to investigate such crimes and bring criminals to justice.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; d) protect the original land claims of the first settlers on that land throug
</EM><BR>
h
<BR>
<EM>&gt; the justice system.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Whether the 'government' is a monopoly state or a competetive PPL system is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; irrelevant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you think burglary is ok, then be prepared to get shot, arrested, and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jailed.
</EM><BR>
<P>Talk about misrepresenting my case!  I was explicitly counterposing a
<BR>
real injustice, namely burglary, with a wrong solution.
<BR>
<P>Also, even if I did endorse burglary, which I most certainly do not,
<BR>
why should I then be arrested, shot and/or jailed?
<BR>
<P>Do you believe in jailing, arresting and shooting people for their
<BR>
ideas, Mr. Lorrey?  Perhaps my characterization of these as a tyrant's
<BR>
schemes were more correct than I supposed.
<BR>
<P>Now let's do a fair comparison:  You believe in the right for persons
<BR>
to exact a toll for a limited time (why?  why on earth?) on something
<BR>
that there is a legitimate right of access to.  I posit that this is
<BR>
morally equivalent to highway robbery.  You can go on about how the
<BR>
highway robber got to the stretch of road first, and therefore has a
<BR>
property right in extracting a toll.  How honor compels us to pay the
<BR>
honorable brigand, and so on.
<BR>
<P>Perhaps it is you who should be prepared that the consequences of your
<BR>
endorsement of highwaymen may be deleterious to your health.
<BR>
<P>...
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I can protect my own property thank you.   I don't need the nanny
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; state and its protection racket.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Prove it. Show me a system where you can protect a milliion copies of a softw
</EM><BR>
are
<BR>
<EM>&gt; application distributed around the world from being pirated. It hasn't been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; invented yet.
</EM><BR>
...
<BR>
<P>My property derives from the rights I have in contractual arrangements
<BR>
with the customers I do bespoke work for.  I am not dreaming utopian
<BR>
fantasies of extorting tolls from the millions.
