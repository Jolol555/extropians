<P><EM>&gt; There is a lot to be said for the sawtooth wave.  The harmonics are so

<EM>&gt; undeniably appealing and the waveform is very versatile.  I wish I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; had learned to program synths on an old analog beast.  My first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; experiences were in the early ages of digital.  Not very pretty from a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; programming standpoint :^)
</EM><BR>
<P>Yeah, but some of the software available now is killing...I make most of my sounds now
<BR>
with a program called MetaSynth that lets you use a Photoshop-style visual interface
<BR>
for sound editing, and you can even pop jpgs in there and convert them to sounds as
<BR>
well.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; This is a very true characterization.  Lately one of the biggest problems,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as I see it, is that when you buy a synth it almost always comes with some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrarily large number of preset sounds which seem to be the staple of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;me too&quot; crowd.  Worse, there is an increasingly large market for machines that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effectively function as &quot;techno construction kits&quot; which take very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; little imagination to use.  A lot of the bland &quot;sameness&quot; with a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the mediocre techno is a result of these trends.  There was a time when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creativity was born out of necessity.  Perhaps the barrier to entry has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; become too low.
</EM><BR>
<P>You have a point there, but then again think of all the mediocre rock bands out there
<BR>
still using the same old chord changes and song forms as 30 years ago...is it really
<BR>
any different?  The bottom line is that it is difficult to make really creative,
<BR>
meaningful music, and it will probably remain so.  I personally have found it more
<BR>
difficult to make good electronic music because there are so many new things to learn,
<BR>
so much technical knowledge to master.  Playing the bass is easy by comparison...
