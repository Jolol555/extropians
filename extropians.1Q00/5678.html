Someone quoted:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;Normally, I dismiss doomsday warnings. But not from a genius. And from an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; industry magnate. And from the leader of the free world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Some of the smartest, most important people in the world think our society
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is at risk from technology. Here are reasons they're running scared...&quot;

<P>This is merely prefacing an article with a baldfaced argument from
<BR>
authority.
<BR>
<P>Imagine if Jesse Berst, the writer of the above quote, rephrased the
<BR>
penultimate sentence in it as &quot;Some of the wealthiest, most powerful members
<BR>
of the elite think...&quot;  Most people would dismiss the article as either
<BR>
propaganda or anthropology of the upper classes.
<BR>
<P>It's also amazing how a few DoS attacks are making some of the elite try to
<BR>
get everyone into a panic, when the actual victims of the attack have
<BR>
learned and moved on.  It sounds more to me like the Media -- including
<BR>
ZDNet -- are trying to rouse us all into supporting some sort of large scale
<BR>
government intervention in internet commerce.
<BR>
<P>L8R!
