<EM>&gt; &gt; I'm toying with the idea of setting up a Deep Anarchy list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; (In DEEP ANARCHY -- AN ELIMINATIVIST VIEW OF
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &quot;THE STATE&quot; &lt;<A HREF="http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml">http://www.buildfreedom.com/tl/tl07d.shtml</A>&gt;,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Max coined the term &quot;Deep Anarchy.&quot;)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; According to Max T. O'Connor (aka Max More):
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt; &quot;Deep Anarchy&quot; is the view that results from these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; thoughts; it is the idea that we already live in an anarchy.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Its not totally a bad idea. Considering how much libertarian thought has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;been shaping politics the last ten years, it does seem to be working a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;bit. The problem is that in joining the establishment, your goals become
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;diluted, and the people wind up with a sweetened, more palatable and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;managable version. Witness how socialists in the democratic parties of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the west were able to turn former laissez faire economies into compound
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;economies of mercantilists using socialist governments to manage and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;dopify the people, and to allow and organize the externalization of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mercantilists costs. Because of this, there was never a revolution of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the proletariat in the west.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;To establish a true anarchy a 'Deep' anarchy, the nihilistic methods
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;must be used as taught in the ChiCom schools.
</EM><BR>
<P>A main point of Max's article is that we already have anarchy,
<BR>
so there's no need to establish it. To me it seems that coercive
<BR>
political systems are complete hoaxes. Deep Anarchy is the
<BR>
view you have once you recognize the deep nature of coercive
<BR>
political systems.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Entice the establishment
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of powerful police forces and the abuse or negation of civil rights.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Atrocities ensue which trigger further rebellion and calls for more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;fascism. There are key points where events can be interrupted to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;establish either fascist totalitarianism or anarchy, and the key to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;which way the population chooses all depends on the propaganda war.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;This does not necessarily need to mean actual physical violence in the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;real world. Since more of the economy is moving to the net, cyber
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;terrorism takes on new power, as seen by events in the last few weeks
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with DoS attacks on prime dot com websites. The problem is figuring out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;how to entice opressive measures by government over the net. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;currently seems that the government is resisting the reprisal/repression
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;urge.
</EM><BR>
<P>The purpose of the list probably needs to include exploring
<BR>
what strategies and tactics may be necessary to persuade
<BR>
people to adopt the Deep-Anarchy view. And once people
<BR>
have the Deep-Anarchy view, what freedom strategies should
<BR>
they practice?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Anyone who looks at the back seat of my Cherokee knows I at least live
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;in one... ;) I'm not so sure about the rest of you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; The purpose of the list might be to explore the deepest aspects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of coercive political systems, including the possibility that all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; current coercive political systems are complete hoaxes.
</EM><BR>
<P>Maybe, what needs to be looked at and seen is that the
<BR>
individuals who masquerade as &quot;government&quot; (so-called)
<BR>
are engaged in a gigantic hoax. How can anyone form a
<BR>
different conclusion after studying Max's article?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Anyone interested?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Certainly, so long as it doesn't get inundated by anarchists who are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;closet socialists (the whole Eugene gang).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Mike Lorrey
</EM><BR>
<P>Initially the list could be promoted to libertarian and
<BR>
anarcho-capitalist types. After it has 100+ subscribers
<BR>
and has been going for a month or two, it could also
<BR>
be promoted to other anarchists.
<BR>
<P>Maybe means can be found to bridge the gap between
<BR>
right and left anarchists. In an anarcho-capitalist world
<BR>
with property rights, left anarchists can acquire property
<BR>
and can, on that property, implement socialist systems.
<BR>
Provided they don't attempt to coercively impose their
<BR>
systems on others, they wouldn't disturb harmony.
<BR>
<P>The list guidelines could spell out how right and left
<BR>
anarchists might coexist harmoniously. Attacks between
<BR>
right and left anarchists would be discouraged. The list
<BR>
would be moderated.
