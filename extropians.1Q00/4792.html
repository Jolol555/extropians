<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Your phrase, &quot;an organization that fights to keep more guns than people
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in circulation&quot; is obviously pejorative and not conducive to polite
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; disagreement. Please reconsider using such language.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I politely disagree.  A statement of fact, no matter how blunt, is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; neither pejorative nor inconducive to polite disagreement.  If I had
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; called the NRA and its sympathizers &quot;violent antisocial irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; paranoid maniacs,&quot; *that* would be pejorative.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Your so-called statement of fact is a statement about the desired goal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of an organization.  Since it is contrary to the publicly stated goals
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;of that organization, and contrary to the personal goals of everyone I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;have ever met who belongs to that organization it is not only pejorative
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;but clearly a delibrate lie to discredit an opponent you know little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;about rather than having to do the hard work of arguing actual facts.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Is it not true that the NRA opposes virtually *every* single piece of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun-control legislation that comes down the pike? 
</EM><BR>
<P>It is not true. They were ready, in fact, to support the current gun
<BR>
bill in congress mandating NICS checks at gun shows, etc. except they
<BR>
insisted that gun show sales get treated exactly like gun dealer sales,
<BR>
with a 5 minute turnaround via the Insta-Check system. Clinton sat on
<BR>
his ass, insisting on a 3 day waiting period (which will kill off all
<BR>
gun shows, check or no check) that is not needed, as the technology and
<BR>
systems are in place and working for a 5 minute turn around. It was
<BR>
Clinton who refused a solution this time, not the NRA. Additionally, we
<BR>
wouldn't have the NICS Insta-Check system in place if it were not for
<BR>
the NRA. They insisted, when they agreed to end opposition to the Brady
<BR>
Bill, that provisions for such a system be added, that the system would
<BR>
be in place within one year of the Brady Bill being passed (it took 3
<BR>
years).
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it not true that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; NRA opposes any attempt reduce the production of new guns? 
</EM><BR>
<P>The federal government is not permitted to control the quantity of guns
<BR>
produced except under martial law conditions. The government does not
<BR>
make the guns, it is a private industry.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it not true
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the NRA is opposed to reducing the number of guns now in circulation?
</EM><BR>
<P>Gun buybacks have been shown to have absolutely no effect on crime. Gun
<BR>
confiscations would obviously start a civil war.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Is it not true that there are more guns in America than there are Americans?
</EM><BR>
<P>No there are not. There are over 250 million Americans, and between 200
<BR>
and 240 million guns.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;   Is it not true that the NRA sees no problem with the ratio of guns to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people?  Please stop me when I've said something that is not true.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, I have stopped you. The only people who see a problem with this are
<BR>
those that think that Americans have no right to keep and bear arms.
<BR>
Such people are fascists and should be treated as such.
<BR>
<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; &quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
</EM><BR>

</EM><BR>
<P>&quot;The tree of liberty, from time to time, needs to be watered with the
<BR>
blood of tyrants and patriots.&quot;  - Thomas Jefferson
<BR>
<P>Isn't this fun?
