Neal, jumbled or not, you sound like you have it way more together than

I did at fourteen. Best wishes to you always.

<EM>&gt;

<EM>&gt; *ahem* I don't know about everyone else on this list,

<EM>&gt;  &gt;And you

<EM>&gt; &gt; the hell
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; did you produce them?).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I didn't know people produced children; I thought they

<EM>&gt; gave birth to them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And you should program the

</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; filter to recognize the extropian list.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; And prepare to exhibit a lot more courage than this
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; if you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ever want to get anywhere.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Will you hide all the hedonic body mods, uploading,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the other stuff, from your conservative moms, kids,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; and neighbors?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Or do you expect that someone else will work to flex
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; their
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; worldviews?  Who exactly do you think it should be?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Or you want your parents (and kids?) to die before
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; speak freely?   And are you sure that your *kids*
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; can't handle
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the topic of sex?  Or maybe, it's you?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; You do have a point; however, I think perhaps that you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; haven't seen all sides of the argument before stating
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your opinion, and your method of stating it was more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; than a little accusatory.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It is pretty much naturally engrained into parents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they need to protect their children from certain
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; things, sex being one of them. It is a social thing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more than a natural thing, I think, but one that is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; none the less very present. I know; often enough I see
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; my parents hastily switching channels when my little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sister enters the room.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sex is a fact of life. Not everybody does it, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; everybody has one (or more!). It is inescapeable in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; society because of procreation being the one of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; main drives of our species. However, many adults, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; teenagers, feel that it is being introduced far too
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; early. I admit I'm one of them; I know
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fifteen-year-olds who know more about copulation then
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some adults. It is understandable why many parents
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seek to shield their children from that situation for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as long as possible, although it doesn't always work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and kids generally realise what its all about by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time they're twelve, although they don't always
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; generate an interest in it then.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In some societies sex is perfectly acceptable when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introduced to the younger generations, and is indeed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an important part of culture; however, there are many
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; societies where that is not so, and it is generally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; deemed unhealthy for the younger generations to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introduced to the concepts. people also seem afraid
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that teenagers will overeact to any kind of sexual
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stuff and attempt to gorge on it. Their opinion may be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; right on some accounts, but it is also wrong on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others; I've seen naked people before (on tv), the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of my sex education coming from Monty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Python's the Life of Bryan....and my general reaction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is comparable to this:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;oh, is that what a naked male looks like? Hm. Ah! I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a book on black holes in from the library...I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should go check it out...I wonder if there's anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good on philosophy...hm...have I called Skye yet
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; today? We should probably get together this weekend
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and work on the computer...or write something...oh, I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have a book plot...&quot; Only much more complex. And
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; jumbled.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But that's just me; I can't derive the entire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population from myself and a few friends. Continuing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; onward...I seem to have lost the brunt of my rant.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Which is probably as well, considering that I'm mostly
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; repeating myself. So, before I add another six or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seven hundred words to this, good night, or good
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; morning, or somewhat inbetween, whatever the case may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be.
