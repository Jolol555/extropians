<P>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                    January 12, 2000
<BR>
<P>ASTEROID POPULATION COUNT SLASHED 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NASA scientists taking a census of large asteroids in our 
<BR>
solar system neighborhood have cut their estimate in half.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The revised calculation comes from data gathered by NASA's 
<BR>
Near-Earth Asteroid Tracking System (NEAT) and published in the 
<BR>
January 13 issue of the journal Nature.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Until now, scientists thought the population of large, 
<BR>
near-Earth asteroids was between 1,000 and 2,000, but we've 
<BR>
downgraded that figure significantly,&quot; said Dr. David Rabinowitz, 
<BR>
of Yale University, New Haven, CT, lead author of the article and 
<BR>
NEAT co-investigator.  &quot;We now believe there are between 500 and 
<BR>
1,000 near-Earth asteroids larger than one kilometer (about 0.6 
<BR>
miles) in diameter.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This newer estimate was made possible by the computerized 
<BR>
technology of the NEAT camera,&quot; Rabinowitz said. The NASA-funded 
<BR>
system began tracking near Earth asteroids and comets in 1995 
<BR>
with a charge-coupled device camera mounted on a 1-meter (39-
<BR>
inch) Air Force telescope atop Mount Haleakala on Maui, HI. 
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The new figures may represent good news in the quest to 
<BR>
achieve NASA's stated goal of finding 90-percent of all large, 
<BR>
near-Earth asteroids by 2010, according to Pravdo.  &quot;Right now we 
<BR>
know of 322 large, near-Earth asteroids,&quot; he said.  &quot;That was a 
<BR>
fairly small fraction of the 2,000 asteroids in our previous 
<BR>
estimate.  With our new calculations of between 500 and 1,000 
<BR>
such objects, this 322 figure represents a large chunk.&quot;     
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While stressing that we must learn more about potential 
<BR>
hazards from asteroids, Rabinowitz said, &quot;None of the asteroids 
<BR>
we've observed will hit Earth anytime in the near future.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This new analysis reduces by half the estimated number of 
<BR>
these potential hazards to Earth,&quot; Pravdo said.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the past, we relied on humans poring over photographic 
<BR>
plates of the nighttime sky,&quot; Rabinowitz said.  &quot;The problem was, 
<BR>
they didn't know how many asteroids they were missing, because 
<BR>
they couldn't see faint objects.  People's eyes also became tired 
<BR>
and teary and they overlooked some objects.  Machines don't get 
<BR>
tired.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;With this computerized technology, we can find asteroids 
<BR>
more easily and count them more accurately,&quot; said NEAT project 
<BR>
manager Dr. Steven Pravdo of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
<BR>
Pasadena, CA, a co-author of the Nature article.  &quot;It's important 
<BR>
to know your observational limits, and with that information, we 
<BR>
can develop models for what we are not able to see.  This makes 
<BR>
our estimates even more accurate.&quot;
<BR>
Additional co-authors on the Nature article are Eleanor Helin of 
<BR>
JPL, NEAT principal investigator, and Kenneth Lawrence, also of 
<BR>
JPL.  Helin was also principal investigator of the Palomar 
<BR>
Planet-Crossing Asteroid Survey, a photographic search program, 
<BR>
conducted for almost 25 years until it was discontinued and 
<BR>
replaced by NEAT, the electronic detection program, in 1995.  Her 
<BR>
efforts were key to the organization of the NEAT program.
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data gathered by the asteroid tracking system are processed 
<BR>
at Haleakala, and then undergo post-processing and analysis at 
<BR>
JPL.  This latest asteroid estimate is based on data collected 
<BR>
between 1995 and 1998. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The asteroid tracking system has been on hiatus for the past 
<BR>
year, but plans are in the works to re-activate the system in 
<BR>
February using an upgraded 1.2 meter (48 inch) Air Force 
<BR>
telescope on Haleakala.  In addition, later this year, NEAT 
<BR>
scientists will begin using the 1.2 meter (48 inch) Oschin 
<BR>
telescope at Palomar Observatory near San Diego, CA.
