<P>
I suspect that will see many different levels of nanotech design tools,
<BR>
similar to what we have now with software and IC design.
<BR>
<P>In general, each level consists of building-block approaches where
<BR>
you put the pieces together to get what you want.  The differences
<BR>
between the levels have to do with the granularity and flexibility of
<BR>
the building blocks.
<BR>
<P>Making something simple like a wooden chair or table would be a matter
<BR>
of specifying the physical arrangement of the pieces, choosing what the
<BR>
legs, back, etc. would look like, picking a grain for the surface, some
<BR>
control over the density, stiffness, etc.  This is the kind of thing
<BR>
an average person would have control over in customizing his house,
<BR>
and would be the highest (crudest) level of design.
<BR>
<P>At a slightly lower level a craftsman could take some time to create
<BR>
his own shapes, colors, patterns, etc.  The raw materials would be from
<BR>
a standard palette, but he could use his artistic talents to create
<BR>
new and unique designs.  Most of what we consider &quot;art&quot;, paintings,
<BR>
sculpture, etc., as well as industrial design, would fall into this
<BR>
category.  Probably many people would have this kind of talent, and
<BR>
these items might well become gifts.  People would donate their designs
<BR>
to the public for the rewards of recognition and approval.
<BR>
<P>Active devices could also be used in modular designs, but this would take
<BR>
more care, time and talent to exploit.  Making a chair that would adjust
<BR>
to the user's weight and body shape would require understanding of motors,
<BR>
sensors, and the properties of the materials used.  Similarly with making
<BR>
shape-changing devices that reconfigure themselves, like an all-purpose
<BR>
kitchen tool.  You have to make sure that the device can move from one
<BR>
configuration to another without getting in its own way, that it can't
<BR>
pinch or hurt someone while changing shape, and so on.  The number
<BR>
of designers with the time and talent to create such devices would be
<BR>
smaller, but still there would probably be many people who could do it.
<BR>
<P>At the lower levels you have people who are designing the modules which
<BR>
will be used at the higher levels - arrangements of motors and sensors
<BR>
which do some standard job (like holding position with controllable
<BR>
stiffness and compliance), video-capable display surfaces, materials with
<BR>
active textures, and who knows what else.
<BR>
<P>And then at the very lowest levels are people who are pushing the
<BR>
frontiers of the fundamental technology itself, with new designs for
<BR>
computers, gears, foods (possibly), new elements which can be incorporated
<BR>
into nanotech structures, etc.
<BR>
<P>I would suspect that as we move down this hierarchy that the difficulty
<BR>
will increase, and that the lower levels will be more likely to be
<BR>
commercially sold than the higher levels.  There may still be very
<BR>
talented people working at the high levels who can sell their designs
<BR>
(assuming some form of IP protection exists).  And there may be people
<BR>
working at the low levels who give their designs away, like our Open
<BR>
Source programmers today.
<BR>
<P>But I think the high levels will be where we will see the closest to a
<BR>
gift economy, like the people today who design virtual worlds for popular
<BR>
games, &quot;skin&quot; interfaces for music players, MUD dungeons, and so on.
<BR>
Once the design tools are easy enough for the average non-technical
<BR>
person to use them, many people enjoy sharing their designs.
<BR>
