<EM> &gt; Instead of letting the suspect go free on a technicality, I propose
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; that we go ahead and prosecute the suspect in a court of law.  Then
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; we also prosecute the cop for violating the suspects' rights...
</EM><BR>
<P>That's the way it always was up until Mapp v. Ohio, where the Supreme
<BR>
Court imposed the exclusionary rule.  There's nothing in the
<BR>
Constitution or traditional legal practice that mandates the rule,
<BR>
just that one decision.  But that decision happened because of years
<BR>
of constant abuse of suspects by cops and prosecutors despite the
<BR>
ostensible remedy of prosecuting them for their conduct.  In reality,
<BR>
that simply never worked, because cops, prosecutors, and judges are
<BR>
all paid by the same monopoly and all take sides instead of working
<BR>
to find the truth.  The higher courts had tried for many years to
<BR>
levy higher sanctions, fines, and other consequences to such abuses
<BR>
of power to no avail.  The assault on Ms. Mapp's person and home was
<BR>
just the last straw the court needed to give up on niceties and
<BR>
impose the strictest sanction they could: exclusion of evidence.
<BR>
<P>Sure, the problem would probably have been better solved by the
<BR>
legislature getting serious with abusive cops, but that kind of
<BR>
stuff doesn't get you elected--&quot;tough (and stupid) on crime&quot; gets
<BR>
you elected.  The courts couldn't create the laws needed, but
<BR>
they do have the power to decide what evidence they'll hear and
<BR>
what they won't, so that's the solution they imposed.  I'm not
<BR>
sure I'm willing to give up on that, because it did have a positive
<BR>
effect on the problem that nothing else prior to that did.
