<EM>&gt;Today's Chicago SunTimes carried a story that nearly 1/3rd of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;working women now earn more than their husbands.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;May you live in interesting times....

<P>The Washington Post also carried the story:
<BR>
<P>NEARLY 30% OF WIVES EARN MORE THAN THEIR HUSBANDS
<BR>
<P>It is increasingly common for a wife to earn more than her husband 
<BR>
in the changing American family.  The percentage increases to 
<BR>
nearly 44% of marriages where the woman has an advanced degree.  
<BR>
In some instances, husbands have elected to stay at home and raise 
<BR>
children, although this is still only a small percentage.  Some 
<BR>
wives expressed they were uncomfortable earning more, and some men 
<BR>
suggest that they have been chided for earning less by friends.   
<BR>
Many of the men interviewed for the story seemed to appreciate the 
<BR>
opportunities that earning less provided.  Eric Sampson, 30, is a 
<BR>
special education teacher and football coach.  His wife, Joanne 
<BR>
Zmolnak, 31, is an attorney and earns three times as much as he 
<BR>
does.  Marriages where the wife earns more are not significantly 
<BR>
more likely to end in divorce.  However, this is also cited as a 
<BR>
reason for divorce, as it was for Kathy Meyer of Palo Alto, Calif.  
<BR>
She divorced her husband (not named) after he ventured into low-
<BR>
wage nonprofit work, while she took a well-paid corporate job.  
<BR>
Both have MBA degrees from Stanford University.

---------------------------------------------
<BR>
<P>Fascinating. Since we all know that &quot;women earn 70% as much as men,&quot; the nearly
<BR>
30% who earn more than their husbands must be married to women!
