<P>
Cops carry guns, many times paid for by taxpayers.
<BR>
<P>Is that wrong?
<BR>
<P>So, the reason to have a gun for self-defense is to defend against others carrying
<BR>
guns.  So, if cops carry most of the guns, who is being defended?
<BR>
<P>It is so that violent crime is down throughout this nation.  Most violent crimes
<BR>
are domestic.
<BR>
<P>Since the '80s, gun related crime is down, and mind-altering pharmaceutical
<BR>
prescriptions are up.  The drop in gun related and other violent crime has very
<BR>
little or nothing to do with these prescriptions, which are seen in sporadic cases
<BR>
of this kind of violence.
<BR>
<P>Gun related crime is down because of gang peace.
<BR>
<P>If drugs were not illegal, there would not be any motive for violence related to
<BR>
drugs, and no non-violent drugs users would be forced into a violent lifestyle,
<BR>
and there would not be &quot;crime school&quot; effect.  Drugs should be legalized and
<BR>
non-violent drug users in prison should be mainstreamed back into working society
<BR>
over six months to a year, if necessary as part of WPA-like Rooseveltian
<BR>
endeavors.
<BR>
<P>The largest cause of fatal traffic accidents is alcohol, and that of the most
<BR>
fatal heart disease cigarette smoking.
<BR>
<P>Why isn't there a list of ingredients on cigarettes?  What is being hidden
<BR>
therein?
<BR>
<P>Is application of poison a crime?  If so, is it not violent?  If people buy
<BR>
products with poisons unbeknownst to them, have they been poisoned?  Can the
<BR>
states sue tobacco more than once?
<BR>
<P>Alcohol is not bad.
<BR>
<P>The right to bear arms is EXPLICITLY stated as the second amendment to the
<BR>
Constitution.
