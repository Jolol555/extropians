<P><EM>&gt;The upshot is that nuclear reactors today are a bit like space launchers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;-- hyper-evolved military spin-offs, expensive, powerful, but unreliable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and not really suitable for low-cost, safe, civilian use. The problem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with this picture is that there is no nuclear equivalent of ROTON or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Beal or Kistler on the horizon; because nuclear technology has strategic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;military implications, no government is going to let some bunch of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;eccentric whacko technology entrepreneurs reinvent it in a cheap, fast,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and out-of-control format that can prove its merit on the open market.
</EM><BR>
<P>Remember, one of the first acts of the Klinton administration was to cancel 
<BR>
Argonne Labs' Integral Fast Reactor project, just before the technology 
<BR>
demonstrator unit was to go on line. We paid more to have the project 
<BR>
dismantled than we would have to have finished it and collected the data.
<BR>
<P>This design was touted as being inherently safe, it operated without need 
<BR>
for waste disposal, as it was designed to burn the high level wastes inside 
<BR>
the containment, and it reprocessed it's own wastes into new fuel on site. 
<BR>
It was even designed as a 'throwaway', after 30 years or so it would be 
<BR>
shut down and sealed off, with only fairly low level contamination 
<BR>
permanently sealed inside until it would be safe to dismantle. Being a fast 
<BR>
breeder, it would have been vastly more efficient than our present PWR designs.
<BR>
<P>Last I heard, the French were pursuing research along these lines.
