<EM>&gt; I'm sure you don't, I have good anti-air defenses for flying things 15 cm in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; size. My 20 guage shotgun that is perfect for woodcock, with #9 shot, would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; take our your little spy plane at anything less than 50 yards, and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; magnum loads I could make shots of around 75-100 yards altitude. Anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; higher and I'd have to bring out the goose gun.... 10 guage #6 magnum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; loads.... Happy flying....
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; (end)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If you and Spike were neighbors it would be the high-tech version of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hatfields and the McCoys!  You would at first hear the buzzing of his r.c.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plane but not get outside fast enough to shoot it down.  Then you would stay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; outside in a lawn chair and blast the plane out of the sky.  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; followed by you putting the r.c. plane on display in your driveway and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; denouncing Spike for his imperialist ways in front of all the neighbors.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; At this point Spike switches to a high-altitude balloon and so you bang out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a s.a.m. in your garage!  Upon shooting his craft down, Spike swears that it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; was a crashed flying saucer and that you are part of a conspiracy that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; switched the real evidence with a balloon!  He writes a best-selling book
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that makes him rich and you wind up trying to fend off hordes of wierd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people that want to break into your house to meet the alien they think you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have locked up in the basement!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So this proves that it just doesn't pay to mess with Spike! lol
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>But I get to make millions too, by jimmying up a fake alien autopsy in
<BR>
my basement. I could sell slides of 'alien tissue' as part of a &quot;Clone
<BR>
Your Own Alien&quot; home science kit, advertised on the back cover of comic
<BR>
books.... I'd write a book &quot;How to Build a Flying Saucer, and other Home
<BR>
Projects, with your sawzall, ducktape, and a gluegun.&quot; and get Bob Lazar
<BR>
to endorse the book as 'the real thing'....
