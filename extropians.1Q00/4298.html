(Thanks for posting this James.)
<BR>
<P><P>Thank you Nick for your efforts in presenting our views to the public and
<BR>
congratulations on creating the format for us and for helping to spread our
<BR>
ideas.  I look forward to seeing the completed program!

<EM>&gt;All,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;BBC TV screened it's program &quot;Heart of the matter&quot; at 11:50PM GMT on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Sunday.  Was pure luck I even found out, happened to spot it in the TV
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guide by sheer luck!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The first half of this program contained a section on life extension
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;delivered by Nick Bostrom of the WTA, and contained interviews with Max
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;More and Natasha Vita More.  After that, they had a discussion with Nick
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;himself, along with a Neurologist (I think), an environmentalist, and of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;course a theologian (there was another guy, can't remember what he did, one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the sciences I think).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I found the host to be reasonably fair, and Nick did a fine job.  However,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I get the feeling the environmentalist guy and the theologian missed the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;plot.  She was going on about needing death and old age in order to &quot;value&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;youth and such.  The usual arguments about missing friends, boredom etc.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;were brought out...  Also the idea of &quot;making space&quot; for the next
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;generation was raised.  When Nick responded on that issue they didn't seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to have much of a response, and the discussion moved on...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The Env. guy seemed to be standard scare monger stuff, even appealing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;directly to the camera at one point to press his message across.  He also
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;brought up the overpopulation argument, to which Nick responded with the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;facts about population decline in the west.  To the Env. guy's credit, he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;did bring up the point about inequality in the distribution of the benefits
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of technology in the developing world.  Not sure what that has to do with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;us striving to become better than we are though:)  His main objection was
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;finite resources&quot;, and that he felt living for an extended length of time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;would be some kind of additional drain on the planet.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;The neurologist to be fair to her was fairly level headed, even bringing up
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the idea of 0-4C body freezing in order to live a &quot;punctuated&quot; extended
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;life, ala Benjamin Franklin I guess.  It seemed obvious that none of them
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;had any previous exposure to TransH/Extropian ideas.  The other scientist
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;guy seemed cautious but optimistic about the future.  Both of the science
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;orientated people seemed the most level-headed IMO.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Unfortunately I felt that it was too short a time, and that given longer
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Nick would have had more opportunity to shine, in between the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;'responsibility to die for our children' diatribes....  I'm sure he could
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;have easily showed them the dead ends in their ways of thinking, but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suppose it's at least some exposure for our ideals.  Maybe it'll get some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;people investigating.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Anyways, that's my take on it.  Would like to say well done to Nick for an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;excellent overview and for his composed stance in the debate!
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Regards,
