<P>Robin, I think you should asterisk the *may*.  You may want to look at

&quot;AIDS as Zoonosis: Scientific and Public Health Implications&quot;

<P>It seems pretty clear that HIV-1 and HIV-2 have different evolutionary
<BR>
histories.  While you may make a case that HIV-1 may have come from
<BR>
chimpanzees, it looks like HIV-2 came from Sykes' monkey or Mangabeys.
<BR>
<P>There is also some lurking evidence that some cases of small cell
<BR>
lung carcinoma may be attributed to SV40 viruses that may have been
<BR>
present in early polio vaccines.  So there are lots of &quot;smoking guns&quot;
<BR>
with regard species crossovers that may have been helped by the
<BR>
development of early vaccines.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Here are the questions to ask:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1) How much have vaccines contributed to health?
</EM><BR>
<P>While HIV may be the scourge now, clearly in the '50's Polio was
<BR>
something that caused a great deal of harm.  A brief glance at
<BR>
Fields Virology indicates that in the early '50's, Polio was paralyzing
<BR>
10-30,000 people a year.  Now, if you can make a *strong* case for
<BR>
Chimp-to-Human transmission for HIV-1 *and* a strong case that it was
<BR>
derived from medical practices and did not occur (perhaps simultaneously)
<BR>
with chimpanzee preparation or consumption as food, then you
<BR>
could make an argument that this was bad simply on the basis
<BR>
of loss of life to HIV vs. loss of life to polio.  To be fairly
<BR>
ruthless about it you would have to do an economic analysis on
<BR>
the NPV of the human lives lost or severely devalued from the '50's
<BR>
to '90s (Polio, had no vaccine been developed) vs. the '80's &amp; '90's
<BR>
(AIDS).  Medical people often use Years of Potential Life Lost, and in
<BR>
this case Polio might be considered worse from the perspective that it
<BR>
generally affected younger people.  I would guess the costs
<BR>
(Polio vs. HIV) come out relatively speaking in the same ballpark.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2) How much have great apes contributed to vaccines, over and above
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what could have been done with other animals?
</EM><BR>
<P>Also from Field's Virology it seems that the polio virus does not cause
<BR>
pathology in mice, only in monkeys and humans.  So it is an open
<BR>
question whether you could have used anything but primates to develop
<BR>
a polio vaccine.  Given the costs involved, I suspect researchers only
<BR>
use primates when there are no other good alternatives.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The answer to the first question seems to be: suprisingly low.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, the cases for Polio, Measles, DPT, Tetnus, etc. vaccines
<BR>
seems pretty clear to me.  I think anti-Cancer vaccines will
<BR>
demonstrate this even further in the future.  I think you can
<BR>
attribute modern health to three things: (1) sanitation,
<BR>
(2) antibiotics, and (3) vaccines.  Now exactly how much weight
<BR>
you want to put on each of those may largely depend on your
<BR>
local environment.  People in cities need sanitation, people
<BR>
in more rural areas probably benefit more directly from antibiotics
<BR>
(curing infections).  Vaccines probably benefit both but perhaps
<BR>
to a lesser degree.  A fourth factor is the simple understanding
<BR>
of germ theory and communicability and getting medical practicioners
<BR>
to follow practices that minimized transmission.  But these factors
<BR>
combined are what has extended average longevity from ~30-40 years
<BR>
to ~75 years.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I suspect the answer to the second question has a similar answer.
</EM><BR>
<P>Hmmmmm....  Developing vaccines in animals that have different
<BR>
biochemistries or do not exhibit pathologies is very difficult.
<BR>
While HIV is inherently difficult due to its mutating nature,
<BR>
it is also difficult because its pathology is worst in humans.
<BR>
As viruses tend to attenuate in their hosts over time, you will
<BR>
only get really bad effects in recent species crossovers.  In
<BR>
distant species a virus be able to be infectious or may be relatively
<BR>
harmless.  That makes it difficult to develop either drugs or vaccines
<BR>
unless you use either the natural hosts or the species in which the
<BR>
pathologies can be measured.
