<P><EM>&gt; Anders: Re. gregs opposition page.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;A good idea. It might be useful to add more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information on which memes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; each group promotes that are counter-transhumanistic,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; although this is maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the second step after compiling a good starting list
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of anti-progressgroups. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I thing Anders has underplayed his hand here, surely
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's the memes that are the real opposition here, an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; idea can be far more powerfull than an indervidual or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; organisation. Admitadly memes must have a means of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; propogation, so it would be foolhardy not to account
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for these.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes. I have a vision of a page or database with various memes and
<BR>
comments/rebuttals against them; at first it would be just the most
<BR>
frequently heard opposing views, later it might expand to more subtle
<BR>
opposition or bad transhumanist memes (there are after all some of
<BR>
those too). 
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The great thing about the meme counter-offencive is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that we can all 'try this at home', by evaluating and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; countering the anti-extropian memes that dwell within
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us! I suggest atrophy and fear to be two things I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; would like to enclude on such a list. 
</EM><BR>
<P>Good point! Although I guess you mean apathy rather than atrophy?
<BR>
Other memes or thoughts that I have in the past tried to fight in our
<BR>
community is naive technophilia, us-vs-them-thinking and technological
<BR>
determinism. There are plenty more memes to be found, understood and
<BR>
blasted away by the light of reason.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Question- how would you go about conveying sufficent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; future shock, without sending ones audience screaming
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into the night?
</EM><BR>
<P>I have found it good to start with stuff that already exists, that
<BR>
feels a bit here-and-now and relating to themselves - practical stuff,
<BR>
spectacular and fun things that have appeared on television etc. Then
<BR>
I try to give a bit of a historical context, showing how quickly
<BR>
things have developed and that this trend is likely to continue in the
<BR>
near future. Then I try to make them think about what this means.
<BR>
