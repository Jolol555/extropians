<EM>&gt;I'm just a shade too young to remember old time radio..(.but I might &gt;just 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;get a few cd's of that too)   but from what i understand it was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;quietentertaining...
</EM><BR>
<P>As a young boy my mother would plant me in front of the radio to listen to 
<BR>
rebroadcasts of old radio shows.  I was entertained on a level that movies 
<BR>
and tv just couldn't do!  I remember my favorite being a &quot;Tales from the 
<BR>
Crypt&quot; type show that had my imagination running overtime and looking under 
<BR>
my bed.
<BR>
<P>Several years ago I also thought that by using the software and hardware 
<BR>
developed for the handicapped one could have a book converted to audio.  All 
<BR>
the pieces of the puzzle seem to be there.  But would there be a copyright 
<BR>
infringement problem??  I know a fellow at my college who showed me how he 
<BR>
tweaked the Jaws (or was it Dragon?) software to sound like a reasonable 
<BR>
facsimile of a human voice.  Before his tweaking it was horrible though!
<BR>
<P>I love the vast variety of audiobooks out there but the unabridged ones are 
<BR>
SO expensive!  Your idea should be done by some enterprising programmer and 
<BR>
I don't see it as a real threat to the slick productions done by the audio 
<BR>
houses that use golden-voiced actors and special effects.
<BR>
