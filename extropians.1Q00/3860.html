<P>
I think Hilary Putnam put it best:  Arguing with a deconstructionist is
<BR>
like having a fistfight with fog.
<BR>
<P>Derrida is open to deconstruction, but if the deconstruction is at all
<BR>
faithful to the process of deconstruction, it won't shift the paradigm in
<BR>
any significant way.  The classic retort of the relativist to the
<BR>
objection that relativism implies its own falsehood is: &quot;So what?&quot;  The
<BR>
deconstructionist has a similar and equally effective move available.  If
<BR>
contradiction bothered you, you wouldn't be a deconstructionist in the
<BR>
first place.
<BR>
<P>There ARE deconstructionists who aren't relativists; Derrida himself was
<BR>
probably one.  He supposedly claimed in conversation that &quot;truth is an
<BR>
incoherent idea, but we simply can't get on without it!&quot;
<BR>
<P>Frankly, I think people in the &quot;third culture&quot; tend to lean too far
<BR>
towards logical positivism and sociobiological ethics.  These people are,
<BR>
to be blunt, shallow thinkers.  Logical positivism (&quot;if it's not
<BR>
analytically derivable or empirically verifiable then it's meaningless!&quot;)
<BR>
is wrong even by its own lights (&quot;so logical positivism, being underivable
<BR>
and unverifiable, is ALSO meaningless?&quot;), and sociobiological ethics can't
<BR>
justify itself any better than competing theories; sociobiological ethics'
<BR>
only leg up on the competition lies in its ambitions to make ethics
<BR>
scientific, appealing to that little logical positivist in us all.  
<BR>
(Note: some sociobiologists now call themselves evolutionary
<BR>
psychologists.  This is fine, but these people shouldn't be trying to do
<BR>
our ethics for us.)
<BR>
<P>The more sober of the &quot;third culture&quot; bunch have more or less converged
<BR>
with the continential philosophers on the PCR/CCR/&quot;evolutionary&quot;
<BR>
epistemology.  (Check out Rorty, of whom I am a recent fan, if you want to
<BR>
see that transition played out.  Hint:  Hegel was probably one of the
<BR>
first pancritical rationalists.  But have you SEEN his logic?)
<BR>
<P>The main difference at work, in my opinion, b/w the third culture and the
<BR>
continentals, is their differing attitudes towards logic.  The
<BR>
continentals fight a hard upward battle to show that logic has no special
<BR>
access to truth.  Evolutionary epistemologists with their heads on should
<BR>
retort that while logic has no *special* access, it's the best we've got,
<BR>
*by our own lights*.  Couple that with a dash of universalism in your
<BR>
ethics and you've got something like objectivism and a healthy
<BR>
cosmopolitianism.  (Dewey would have called it &quot;democratic,&quot; if only
<BR>
because he, along with many other modern Americans, can't imagine a system
<BR>
where everybody participates that isn't Democracy.  He should have read
<BR>
Adam Smith or Hayek more closely.)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, I've blathered on enough for now.
