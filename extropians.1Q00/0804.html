<EM>&gt; &gt; I.e., calling a theory X

<EM>&gt; &gt;  'true' does not say we cease having doubts about theory X&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sure it does, that is what &quot;true&quot; means and that is the problem . . .
</EM><BR>
because
<BR>
<EM>&gt; it _mutates the meme_ (and concept definition) &quot;true&quot; far out beyond a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Popperian non-dogma of critical rationalism and the evolutionary
</EM><BR>
epistemology
<BR>
<EM>&gt; of comprehensively critical rationalism.
</EM><BR>
<P>Blah blah blah.  See my &quot;Comments on Pancritical Rationalism&quot; at my web
<BR>
site, which people on this list have ignored before.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is unnescessarily confusing in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science.  Now we will have to define (re-define) that we really don't mean
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;true&quot; in the everyday sense?  I don not think that is wise.  Better to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; simply not call theories true, avoid that use of the misleading concept
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; re-definition.
</EM><BR>
<P>I generally agree here that theories are theories.  They are valid or fit
<BR>
the facts.  Even so, what usually happens to good theories is they get taken
<BR>
up into superceding theories, much as Darwin's theory has been modified and
<BR>
become part of modern theories (there are more than one, you know?) of
<BR>
evolution.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The word concept &quot;fact&quot; is just as bad.   Here is some of what I wrote on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this subject:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In an article entitled:  &quot;Kansas and Evolution As Fact: The Scientist's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Error&quot; I said:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &quot;Carl Sagan, unfortunately, proved to be an example, when he said that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; evolution was not a theory: 'Evolution is not a theory, it is a fact,' in
</EM><BR>
his
<BR>
<EM>&gt; corporation for public broadcasting television program _Cosmos_.  That was
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; dangerously dogmatic thing to say.  The show, _Cosmos_, was his popular
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; science series and perhaps he really did not mean to make such an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unscientific and emotional statement.  He was frustrated with irrational
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; religious dogma of the creationists.  He should have known better, but he
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; chose to fight dogma, with dogma -- but that was not a good strategy.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot; . . . the evolution-as-fact, argument is 1) a matter of personal
</EM><BR>
opinion,
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 2) an irrational faith in the scientific method, 3) is a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; interpretation of evidence by inductive not deductive reasoning, 4)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; circumvents science's open mindedness of such philosophies as pancritical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; rationalism.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;A theory by definition, is an explanation for a group of facts, not a
</EM><BR>
fact
<BR>
<EM>&gt; itself.  Neither is it &quot;true&quot; because every theory changes, that is,
</EM><BR>
theories
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;evolve&quot; -- they are not static and do not meet the definition of a static
</EM><BR>
or
<BR>
<EM>&gt; final &quot;truth.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>I think what Sagan meant -- and, for the record, I'm not an apologist for
<BR>
him:) -- was that evolution the phenomena (biological taxa changing) is a
<BR>
fact while evolutionary theory (the explanation of why such taxa change) is
<BR>
not a fact.  This is, at least, my take on it.  Now, we could push things
<BR>
back a bit and say the true phenomena is stuff like fossils, the diversity
<BR>
of life, the similarity of various life forms, the way the classification
<BR>
system in biology seems to yeild up a tree-like structure (e.g., cladograms)
<BR>
are facts/truths.  In this instance, I would agree and adopt a stance that
<BR>
truth is contextual (though not subjective) and that the ultimate ground is
<BR>
sense perception.
<BR>
<P>That said, if we bundle the aforementioned stuff together and call it
<BR>
evolution, then there still exists a distinction between it as a bundle and
<BR>
what explains it.  There are levels of abstraction here.  Evolutionary
<BR>
theory is on a higher level than evolution the phenomena which in turn is on
<BR>
a higher level than physical evidence which I can see and touch.
<BR>
