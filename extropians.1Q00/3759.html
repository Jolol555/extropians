<P>By LIDIA WASOWICZ, UPI Science Writer  
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 23 (UPI) -- Scientists who have unlocked  
<BR>
the secret of a protein molecule that can slow aging in yeast by turning 
<BR>
off selected sections of its genetic machinery want to know whether the 
<BR>
same key could open the door to longer lifespans for men and women. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The hope is that researchers may one day be able to intervene  
<BR>
in, and possibly inhibit, the aging process in humans,&quot; said lead study 
<BR>
author Leonard Guarente, professor of biology at the Massachusetts 
<BR>
Institute of Technology in Cambridge. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While much work remains, including a corroboration of the  
<BR>
results in animals, &quot;our findings keep this hope alive,&quot; he told United 
<BR>
Press International. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research may provide the missing link that ties together  
<BR>
previous results showing that yeast with extra copies of the protein 
<BR>
Silent Information Regulator, SIR2, live longer, that decreased metabolic 
<BR>
rates extend longevity and that cutting back on calories slows metabolism 
<BR>
and adds years to one's life. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The new finding connects longevity, the silencing of gene  
<BR>
expression and the slowing of metabolic state,&quot; Guarente said in an 
<BR>
interview. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies have shown reducing caloric intake can extend  
<BR>
lifespan, although the mechanism for this correlation has been unclear, 
<BR>
the scientists said in the British journal Nature. SIR2 might be the link 
<BR>
between energy metabolism and longevity, turning genes off in response to 
<BR>
reduced energy levels, they suggested. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So far, we have shown the connection between silencing and  
<BR>
longevity in yeast, a simple system. The silencing is keeping the genome 
<BR>
stable; it is genome instability that causes aging,&quot; Guarente said. &quot;We 
<BR>
don't know if this is true in humans.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the year is out, the investigators expect to have  
<BR>
gained key insight into whether SIR2 controls aging in animals, notably 
<BR>
mice, which normally live two to three years, and worms, with a 
<BR>
two-to-three-week lifespan. They plan to insert an extra copy of SIR2 in 
<BR>
the animals to determine if it will enable them to live longer. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;With the worm's short longevity, especially, we can get a  
<BR>
view of the aging picture rapidly,&quot; Guarente said. &quot;If we find SIR2 
<BR>
regulates aging in animals, we will know we are on track.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any success in slowing the aging process will have  
<BR>
far-reaching repercussions on human health, the scientists said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If we slow down aging, we will slow down the diseases closely  
<BR>
associated with aging, such as osteoporosis. The whole point would be to 
<BR>
reduce the period of morbidity,&quot; Guarente said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Does this mean we could be immortal? No, but it does mean  
<BR>
some of the diseases of aging could be curtailed so that we could play 
<BR>
tennis and feel healthier and lead more active lives longer.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the animal tests corroborate the early findings, the next  
<BR>
phase would be to design an anti-aging drug and to test it on worms, he 
<BR>
said, emphasizing any such pill would slow down -- not reverse -- the 
<BR>
aging process. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Our goals are very much in the spirit of modern medicine --  
<BR>
to increase the human health span,&quot; Guarente said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the yeast experiment, the researchers found the anti-aging  
<BR>
enzyme has its spell-binding effect by turning off entire sections of the 
<BR>
genome, the complete set of an organism's genes, said study co-author 
<BR>
Shin-ichiro Imai, postdoctoral associate in biology. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The study gives scientists a better understanding of previous  
<BR>
findings that restricting caloric intake to 70 percent of normal levels 
<BR>
significantly extends the lifespans of yeast, earthworms, mice and 
<BR>
possibly primates, the authors said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This is the first concrete indication that genome silencing  
<BR>
and metabolism are connected,&quot; Guarente said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Proteins related to SIR2, discovered in the yeast  
<BR>
Saccharomyces cerevisiae -- where it is involved in turning off genes -- 
<BR>
have been found in mammals, including man, the scientists said. What 
<BR>
remains to be seen is whether adding extra copies of the molecule to the 
<BR>
higher lifeforms will produce the same life-extending results it did in 
<BR>
the simple system. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The team discovered SIR2 is a type of histone deacetylase, an  
<BR>
enzyme which turns off gene production by modifying the so-called 
<BR>
&quot;chromatin&quot; proteins, those that package and protect chromosomes, 
<BR>
thread-like structures that transmit genetic inheritance from parent to 
<BR>
offspring. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In each cell, some genes are active and others silenced. Skin  
<BR>
and brain cells, for example, are genetically identical -- the difference 
<BR>
lies in their prebirth programming to produce certain genes but not 
<BR>
others. SIR2 can influence which gene groups are permanently silenced, 
<BR>
the end result being prevention of age-related problems that surface late 
<BR>
in life, the scientists said. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;As cells age, genes that had always been turned off sometimes  
<BR>
get turned on, causing problems that can lead to cell death,&quot; Guarente 
<BR>
said, noting SIR2 would prevent such activation. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To their surprise, the scientists observed that to carry out  
<BR>
its life-prolonging function, SIR2 requires the ubiquitous energy carrier 
<BR>
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, or NAD, which is normally involved in 
<BR>
the breakdown of food molecules, said study co-author Christopher 
<BR>
Armstrong. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Made by all cells, these co-enzymes help transfer electrons  
<BR>
and hydrogen in some reactions that reduce oxidation, said study 
<BR>
co-author Matt Kaeberlein, noting studies have linked food high in 
<BR>
anti-oxidants to lower cancer rates and slowed aging. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Although NAD and NADH are frequent enzyme co-factors in  
<BR>
oxidation-reduction reactions, this is the first example to our knowledge 
<BR>
in which NAD drives a distinct enzymatic reaction,&quot; the authors wrote. 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The NAD connection came out of the blue, but it has an  
<BR>
interesting implication: NAD could well be the signal for the metabolic 
<BR>
status of cells,&quot; Guarente said. &quot;If an organism is starved for calories, 
<BR>
the NAD level may go up. More NAD means activating SIR2, which silences 
<BR>
sections of the genome and increases lifespan.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since genes similar to SIR2 have been found in numerous  
<BR>
organisms, Guarente said, the hope is &quot;if we can keep SIR2 active for 
<BR>
longer, we may slow down aging.&quot; 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The research was funded by the Human Frontier Science Program  
<BR>
Organization, the National Institutes of Health, the Seaver Foundation, 
<BR>
Ellison Medical Foundation and the Howard and Linda Stern Fund.
