See
<BR>

<BR>
<P>The idea is great, and the show is certainly fun to
<BR>
watch, but it's not realizing its full potential.
<BR>
I mean, just look at some of the rules (and there
<BR>
are lots more of 'em, which is usually bad news for
<BR>
the entertainment value):
<BR>
<P>The following is a list of materials and practices that are prohibited: 
<BR>
<P>[...] 
<BR>
<P>2. All electronic weaponry, stun-guns, Tesla coils, heat guns or irons,
<BR>
etc. 
<BR>
<P>3. All liquid and gaseous weaponry such as water, glue (including tape),
<BR>
expandable foam, halon, etc. 
<BR>
<P>[...]
<BR>
6. Flying Robots are not permitted (anything that makes use of an
<BR>
airfoil for lift). However, Floating Robots utilizing electric motors
<BR>
are permitted. 
<BR>
===
<BR>
<P>Now, wouldn't it be much more fun if those robots, instead
<BR>
of just pushing eachother around as they usually do, save
<BR>
for the occasional attack with a spike, axe or saw blade,
<BR>
would (also) be blasting eachother with guns, arrows,
<BR>
tasers, rockets, flame throwers etc. None of those stupid 
<BR>
pits or time limits either; the robots fight until only 
<BR>
one is left operational. To make things more interesting the
<BR>
battle should be fought in a fairly large arena with all
<BR>
sorts of obstacles (low walls, barrels etc.) which
<BR>
can be used to take cover behind, or launch an ambush
<BR>
from. Preferably more than 2 robots would do battle
<BR>
at once, either in teams or in a free-for-all
<BR>
deathmatch.
<BR>
<P>Flying robots, which are prohibited in the
<BR>
current Robot Wars show, could have their own
<BR>
competitions (aerial combat with real bullets,
<BR>
rockets etc.), or be pitted against ground robots.
<BR>
You could also have floating bots, which would try 
<BR>
to sink eachother or fight land/air bots.
<BR>
<P>All vehicles would be required have at least one on-board
<BR>
camera, for more spectacular action shots and as a
<BR>
means to (help) navigate for the controllers. Because
<BR>
of all the projectiles flying around there would be
<BR>
no audience as in the original show, but all action
<BR>
would be either fed onto the net (for free or via a
<BR>
pay-for-access site) and/or put on tape and sold,
<BR>
possibly to some interested tv network (I'm sure
<BR>
*someone* would want to buy it) or else as a video
<BR>
series.
<BR>
<P>The location would probably have to be somewhere 
<BR>
in the US (some place with relaxed gun laws), in a
<BR>
remote (desert?) area or on some private island,
<BR>
for example.
<BR>
<P>Some additional ideas: apart from radio-controlled
<BR>
bots you could also let AIs (if that's what you can
<BR>
call 'em) fight eachother in separate or mixed
<BR>
matches. Human vs machine (the shape of things to 
<BR>
come) ;) Also, you could let people control bots via 
<BR>
the net, and hold mass Doom-style battles or smaller,
<BR>
private matches. The robots would obviously have to
<BR>
be standard models which would be &quot;rented&quot; by the players 
<BR>
for the duration of the game, or perhaps more permanently.
<BR>
<P>I suppose a similar setup could also be used to hunt 
<BR>
rats or some other animals within a certain designated 
<BR>
area (old warehouse, for example), or humans (with paintball
<BR>
bullets or stun guns, presumably). A game show where human
<BR>
players have to fight remote-controlled or AI bots -and
<BR>
perhaps eachother- with various nonlethal weaponry could
<BR>
be a lot of fun. Even with relatively modest cash 
<BR>
prizes it shouldn't be hard to find players for this
<BR>
sort of thing, and the audience would no doubt love it.
