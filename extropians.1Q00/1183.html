<P>Huh???  I would say the fundamental cause for ecological disruption
<BR>
is a failure to account in an economic sense (meaning in the
<BR>
accounting and tax laws) for &quot;theft&quot; from the global commons.
<BR>
The solution to this is not &quot;less&quot; government regulation, but &quot;more&quot;.
<BR>
<P>Now, perhaps you are saying this, but it seems indirect.  The
<BR>
government could be *totally* uninvolved and developers might
<BR>
still develop land in ways that polluted streams and damaged
<BR>
salmon habitats.  Until the developers have to &quot;account&quot; for that
<BR>
damage in some way (ultimately passing the costs onto the
<BR>
land/housing purchasers), you will have environmental degradation.
<BR>
<P>The same applies to the pollution produced by your automobile,
<BR>
sewer wastes, farm fertilizer runoff, electrical power plant, etc.
<BR>
If you are in any way &quot;changing&quot; the environment and you do not
<BR>
have an accounting line item to deal with those &quot;free inputs&quot;
<BR>
and associated &quot;costs&quot;, then you are a bandit.  This isn't a
<BR>
government problem it is an accounting problem.
<BR>
<P>Now, this is in no way to say that governments don't contribute
<BR>
to the problem.  The decline in fisheries around the globe is
<BR>
due in large part to the &quot;hands off&quot; approach to regulation as
<BR>
well as a promotion of the industry through subsidies aimed
<BR>
at producing more and increasingly efficient sea-produce harvesters.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Face it, the free market on its own would not invest in the Amazon,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the American Southwest, or Nigeria.  Those places are either unsafe,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't provide skilled labor, don't have the infrastructure (roads,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; housing, etc.), or lacking in resources.  Also, what resources there are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are already owned -- in the Lockean sense of the world, even if the local
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; governments don't recognize such ownership -- by the locals.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<P>Huh?  I'm not sure where this came from, but it depends entirely on
<BR>
what type of &quot;investment&quot; you are discussing.  We are lossing millions
<BR>
of acres of rain-forest annually because the &quot;land&quot; and clearing costs
<BR>
are cheap enough and the returns on cattle production profitable enough
<BR>
to justify that activity in the Amazon.  What is missing is an accounting
<BR>
for the environmental degradation that results from those activities.
<BR>
<P>Now, with regard to NY, I would agree that you have a messed up
<BR>
system derived from some collusion between the politicians and the
<BR>
building industry.  Removing rent control would simply result
<BR>
in creating a highly exclusive enclave in Manhatten.  Whether
<BR>
that is good or bad is IMO a social issue.
