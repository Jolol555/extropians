</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;snip&gt;  Eliezer, saying Otter instead of denOtter is as incorrect
<BR>
as referring to me as ike ones, or you as kowsky.  But that isnt
<BR>
why I posted.
<BR>
<P>Seems like in the race between strong nanotech and AI, regardless
<BR>
of which one happens first, the other cant be far behind it, for each
<BR>
would facilitate the other.  Which leads me to this question:
<BR>
<P>Are there many possible scenarios regarding the outcome of
<BR>
the Singularity, and is there matrix or something that maps out
<BR>
all the possible outcomes?
<BR>
<P>Reason: I have been trying to imagine a slow Singularity, wherein
<BR>
everything changes, but much of humanity notices nothing for
<BR>
some time afterwards.
<BR>
<P>Consider an historical singularity, lower case s: the stock market
<BR>
crash of 1929.  On the day of that crash (October 29?) many
<BR>
fortunes were wiped out but my great grandmother's journal
<BR>
recorded nothing unusual on that day, or the week following
<BR>
or the month following.  They didnt notice, they didnt even
<BR>
know anything untoward had happened.
<BR>
<P>Likewise, if a Singularity happened in the next 5 years, most
<BR>
of humanity wouldnt know or care for some time afterward,
<BR>
altho you and I would face an immediate crisis.
<BR>
<P>Next, we tend to think of a Singularity that pretty much takes
<BR>
everyone by surprise.  [Well, not you Eliezer, you will likely have
<BR>
written the thing.  {8^D  ]  But what if we had a nearly universally
<BR>
anticipated Singularity?  Heres how that would work: we figure
<BR>
out a way to simulate human intelligence, sort of, so that we have
<BR>
a machine that can think, but isnt very fast.  You set it to witty
<BR>
sarcasm mode, it thinks of a snappy comeback after about a
<BR>
week.  Suppose we write a human mind-simulator but find it
<BR>
takes a jillion CPU cycles to figure out the punchline of a joke,
<BR>
for instance.
<BR>
<P>Then, everyone can extrapolate to see that if we Moore's Law
<BR>
for say 15 more years, using *this* algorithm, we have a pretty good
<BR>
silicon companion.  Then we might well realize that if we just
<BR>
manufacture a few billion such processors, we could effectively
<BR>
double the number of brains working on humanity's problems,
<BR>
etc, and it is easy to see we could start an intellectual avalanche.
<BR>
Would that not be a highly anticipated Singularity?  Would we
<BR>
not have 15 years to try to make friends with computers,
<BR>
kiss our butts goodbye, build spaceships etc?
<BR>
<P>What other scenarios have been suggested?  Are these
<BR>
documented?  spike
