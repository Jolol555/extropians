<P><EM>&gt; &gt;&gt;From Wired News:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;he said. &quot;They are achievers, employed, and with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;disposable income. What makes them do it?&quot; If Britain's drug
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;czar can't answer that question, then who can?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Their longing to transcend existential angst makes them do it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Drug users are achievers, employed, and have disposable
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;incomes...  then why the war against drugs?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;BM
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Drug use threatens the ruling class, which itself remains immured in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existential angst.
</EM><BR>
<P>These are the common responses I tend to hear to explain the WOD from
<BR>
the non-party line point of view, but I don't buy them much. If
<BR>
longing to transcend existential angst makes people take drugs, why do
<BR>
they not start to meditate? If drug use threatens the ruling class,
<BR>
shouldn't we see a war on printing/internet too? (not just a dislike
<BR>
for &quot;yellow press&quot; or moral panics about child porn but a serious
<BR>
concerted attempt to get rid of the evil stuff). If the ruling class
<BR>
was so upset about people finding ways out of existential angst, why
<BR>
are they not cracking down on religions and comedy?
<BR>
<P>I think we need to think a bit more carefully about the problem than
<BR>
spouting what is essentially the &quot;non-conformist party line&quot; (the
<BR>
above claims can be found practically verbatim in the writings of RAW,
<BR>
Leary et al). After all, as transhumanists we need good arguments
<BR>
ourselves as well as an understanding of why people act the way they
<BR>
do.
<BR>
<P>Existential angst is really just the idea that ordinary life has a
<BR>
negative emotional valence - which doesn't seem to hold true in
<BR>
general. People have a large variability in emotional states and
<BR>
personalities. I actually laughed aloud when I read Sartre, and he
<BR>
claimed that people who did not feel existential angst actually were
<BR>
repressing it. My personal theory is that much of existentialism was
<BR>
founded by people who would have benefited from prozac :-)
<BR>
<P>A more likely set of reasons for people taking drugs is a combination
<BR>
of pleasure- or novelty-seeking, peer pressure, cultural conditioning
<BR>
as well as (conscious or unconscious) self-medication. Then what
<BR>
happens of course dependens on the interaction of the drug, person and
<BR>
environment, the outcomes can be quite variable. 
<BR>
<P>Now, the attempt to suppress drugs is an interesting social
<BR>
phenomenon. I have no doubt that there are people much more in the
<BR>
know about the history of drug legality worldwide, but overall it
<BR>
seems that banning drugs as substances of abuse was something that
<BR>
occured relatively recently, in the 30's and 40's if I don't
<BR>
minsremember. Of course alcohol has a longer legal history but may
<BR>
fall under other sociopolitical forces, as did opium during the opium
<BR>
war (where banning it was very much a statement about foreign
<BR>
policy). 
<BR>
<P>What was the reasons for the bans? I think (here the historians might
<BR>
help) that concerns about public health was the major official
<BR>
reason. Before this time, public health was a problem that was too
<BR>
hard to deal with, but at this time it appeared more and more possible
<BR>
that it could be fixed by a benevolent state and hence that it should
<BR>
be fixed; hence the anti-drug stance previously taken mainly by
<BR>
smaller organisations could now be implemented nationwide.
<BR>
<P>But why regard it as a public health problem? Part of an answer might
<BR>
very well be that it is a public health problem or at least looks like
<BR>
one. But a deeper reason would be the anti-hedonic streak we find in
<BR>
western culture; this in turn seems to date back to the emergence of
<BR>
Christianity with some memes from the Romans, Greeks and other
<BR>
groups. However, the history of *that* is beyond my skills as an
<BR>
amateur archeologist :-) To backtrace a bit, puritanism certainly
<BR>
played an important role here. The idea of keeping pure, the idea of
<BR>
having healthy citizens to act as cogs in the national machine. Note
<BR>
that this has nothing to do with *controlling* them (that was the duty
<BR>
of other aspects of the emerging etatist worldview, such as public
<BR>
schooling instilling &quot;democratic values&quot; or whatever the local system
<BR>
called its basic memes). You don't need to assume that keeping people
<BR>
away from drugs makes them easier to control (I would say the opposite
<BR>
seems almost to be true) to see that from a puritanical etatist
<BR>
mindset drugs would be bad - the people should find their happiness in
<BR>
God/working for the common good rather than drugs, and if they do
<BR>
drugs they might no longer be the good citizens the state needs. 
<BR>
<P>Then we have the self-supporting dialectics of the WOD, which I guess
<BR>
everybody understands quite well by now. It is roughly the same
<BR>
phenomenon as the war against doping in sport or the politics of
<BR>
eastern block: one cannot deviate one inch from the partyline (or you
<BR>
are viewed as a traitor or weak point), and if an approach doesn't
<BR>
work, it was because one didn't try hard enough. Finding alternatives
<BR>
would undermine the legitimacy of the current approach, which becomes
<BR>
more and more entrenched as various institutions, careers and
<BR>
structures are built on and for it. The nice thing about this kind of
<BR>
development is that it tends to break down due to its own weight
<BR>
sooner or later. The bad thing is that it tends to hurt a lot of
<BR>
people when it does.
<BR>
<P><P>Of course, this won't satisfy the paranoids among us :-) They now know
<BR>
I'm really an agent of THEM, trying to keep the doors of perception
<BR>
shuttered.
<BR>
<P><P>Hmm, got a bit longer than I intended. My flu seems still to affect my
<BR>
writing inhibitions, making them somewhat erratic (I answer some
<BR>
posts, but maybe not the ones I ought to answer). Interesting. Worth
<BR>
doing a study on...
