<EM>&gt; At any rate, it gets very messy very fast, since the code was

<EM>&gt; Millennium Copyright Act&quot;...  Will there be an increase in

<EM>&gt; (as Russia and China largely do now)?

<P>Norway isn't a rogue; Norway is a respectable signatory of the
<BR>
Berne Convention. Time was when the _USA_ was the copyright rogue,
<BR>
ignoring copyright declarations on work filed in other countries
<BR>
(as exemplified by the pirate publishing of Lord of the Rings
<BR>
in the 1960's).
<BR>
<P>There seem to me to be two issues -- firstly, the fact that the
<BR>
Digital Millennium Copyright Act in the USA can rock the boat
<BR>
outside the USA (a market of 270 million people being too big to
<BR>
ignore), and secondly, that the US government is keen to export 
<BR>
its legal standards in the name of removing barriers to free trade;
<BR>
it is quite capable of trying to bring in such restrictions elsewhere
<BR>
in the world, and some bodies (the European Commission in particular)
<BR>
are dumb enough to think that anything invented in the USA _must_ be
<BR>
worth emulating. (After all, the whole point of the EU is to emulate
<BR>
American success at removing internal trade barriers between what
<BR>
were once quasi-independent states; the Euro-Federalist agenda 
<BR>
explicitly aims to create an integrated economic superpower by
<BR>
peaceful means.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I still think there are many people who don't understand that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the troll isn't content to stay under the bridge any more.

<BR>
Yup. I've been banging this drum for a while. Our existing concept
<BR>
of copyright is based on technologically imposed limits (that 
<BR>
duplicating information requires expensive, bulky equipment that's
<BR>
easy to monitor) that are no longer true. (And indeed, the whole
<BR>
concept of copyright comes from an intermediate age, when copying
<BR>
was possible but not easy, between the copy-it-longhand era and
<BR>
the information-duplication-costs-tend-towards-zero era.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; As I and others have pointed out, the best model is to produce
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the &quot;copyrighted works&quot; cheaply enough that it eliminates the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; incentive to &quot;steal&quot; work.  
</EM><BR>
<P>Hence open source; copying is free advertising for a commercial software
<BR>
vendor -- where they make their money is off services.
