<EM>&gt; &gt;Each of us exists AT THE PRESENT  MOMENT as a unique physical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;construction of atoms.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; That happens to be true, but it expresses no profound truth, it's just an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; accident of history. No reason to expect it always to be true.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I think that it will almost always be true.  The cost of
<BR>
disassembling a large unique collection of atoms (to isotopic specificity)
<BR>
and reassembling it *identically*, is probably *very* large.  [Consider
<BR>
the error correction required for this.]
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;     &gt; It is possible to say this, but that does not make it unambiguous.  For
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;example, what if you make two copies simultaneously? Which one,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     &gt;then is &quot;you&quot;?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Only one way to tell, ask them. I'll bet you already know what they'll say.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here is one way to look at the problem.  We all have computers
<BR>
that have processors that are run the same instructions and
<BR>
for most purposes appear to be identical.  However, if you understand
<BR>
semiconductor manufacturing process, I'm sure that most will agree
<BR>
that the transistors in those processors *are not* identical at
<BR>
the atomic scale.  Simple dimensions, quantities of dopant atoms,
<BR>
impuritues in the silicon, dopants, or conductors require that they
<BR>
be physically different.  However(!), they function *identically*
<BR>
within the realm of how those transistors are supposed to operate.
<BR>
<P>In the long run, the physical atomic differences, and &quot;life histories&quot;,
<BR>
will probably determine the maximum working life of individual processors.
<BR>
But during the &quot;lifespan&quot; of those processors, they are, from the
<BR>
perspective of everyday use, &quot;identical&quot;.  Now, if you push them to
<BR>
the *absolute* limits, say by raising their temperature or by
<BR>
increasing their clock speed, you will find that they are distinct
<BR>
&quot;individuals&quot;.
<BR>
<P>So, in the &quot;human&quot; copying process, the questions come down to the
<BR>
reproducibility of the simulation.  If you have extensive levels of error
<BR>
correction code in the copying process and simulation hardware which
<BR>
captures the inherent randomness present in molecular diffusion
<BR>
and radiation in cells, then you will have an accurate copy.  However
<BR>
the minute the copies go off in different directions, they become
<BR>
unique individuals (due to the diffusion and radiation effects).
<BR>
<P>I'm going to state *very* clearly, so people get out of the magical
<BR>
quantum realm: &quot;MOLECULAR DIFFUSION EFFECTS and RANDOM RADITION *DWARF*
<BR>
any Quantum Effects&quot;!
<BR>
<P>So, in answer to the question of &quot;who is the orginal?&quot; -- it is easy,
<BR>
the person who has the most identical atomic match to the original.
<BR>
Within milliseconds of the copying process however, neither of them
<BR>
is &quot;an original&quot;.  You can only have an &quot;original&quot; if the copying
<BR>
process stores it in a computer with sufficient ECC that you can
<BR>
*reliably* reproduce the original.
<BR>
<P>I think where most people get stuck is the rather *huge* scale
<BR>
differences between things like cells, synapses, molecules &amp;
<BR>
atoms.  Until these are really grasped, people spend a lot of
<BR>
time shouting at each other.  If they were standing in the
<BR>
shadow of the Empire State Building, looking through a microscope
<BR>
at a grain of sand picked up from the street, it would be obvious
<BR>
that you could make a functional copy of the Empire State building,
<BR>
while making a accurate copy of the grain of sand would be a bit more
<BR>
difficult.  For the purposes of copying human existences (and identity)
<BR>
however, the Empire State Building copies would seem to be sufficent.
