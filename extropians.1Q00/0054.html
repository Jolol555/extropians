&nbsp;Angry at Pokemon
<BR>
by Steve Johnson
<BR>
Uri Geller, a performer who pretends to have psychic powers, is
<BR>
threatening a $100 million lawsuit over the Pokemon charactr Kadabra,
<BR>
according to the New York Post. 
<BR>
Geller, whose stage act includes pretending to bend spoons with the
<BR>
power of his mind, says that Kadabra, a Pokemon character who carries a
<BR>
spoon and injures his opponents with a psychic attack, is based on him.
<BR>
Kadabra is known in Japan as &quot;Un Geller,&quot; the Post reported. 
<BR>
Geller first became aware of the similarity when visiting the Pokemon
<BR>
Center in Tokyo, a shopping center specializing in Pokemon products.
<BR>
Geller was mobbed by admirers, then discovered that they were interested
<BR>
in him because of the Pokemon character, not his own reputation. 
<BR>
No word yet on whether Jackie Chan or the estate of Bruce Lee will be
<BR>
suing over Pokemon characters Hitmonchan and Hitmonlee …
