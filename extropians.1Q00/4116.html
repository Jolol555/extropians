<P>
<EM>&gt; This was just an example to introduce the notation. Use the mugging
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fact instead if that suits you better.
</EM><BR>
<P>The mugging fact won't do.  The mugging fact is a claim which is true iff
<BR>
a certain ethical claim is right and if a certain empirical claim is true.
<BR>
You can settle the empirical claim, I'm arguing, but not the ethical one.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You keep restating claims like this as if they were obvious;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they aren't.  This is the issue we are arguing about.
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll fall back on my Omega Point argument, because I think I can force
<BR>
this one through more easily than my computability argument (though I
<BR>
actually like that one a bit better).
<BR>
<P>Allow me to restate the claim in a more general manner.  Assume, for the
<BR>
moment, that the state of my beliefs can be completely determined by some
<BR>
numbering scheme.  (Think Godel numbers here.)  Each number follows from a
<BR>
very complicated rule of inference from the previous number.  Suppose you
<BR>
knew this rule of inference completely.
<BR>
<P>Now you want to ask which number I'll &quot;end up believing,&quot; or at least tell
<BR>
me some number theoretic properties about that number.  Suppose you're
<BR>
curious as to whether that number will be even or odd.
<BR>
<P>Now notice that if I live forever and have an infinite number of thoughts
<BR>
(that is, if there is no end to the list of numbers which represent my
<BR>
beliefs), there's no way for you to tell whether my &quot;last&quot; number will be
<BR>
even or odd, in exactly the same respect as it would be impossible for you
<BR>
to determine whether the last natural number will be even or odd.  And
<BR>
notice as well that it doesn't matter how many finite odd or even examples
<BR>
you provide: there's STILL no way for you to tell me that the last natural
<BR>
number is odd.  There IS no last natural number on this picture.
<BR>
<P>You might step in and say &quot;Well, number theory is very young, so I can't
<BR>
tell you what sort of examples would provide evidence that the last number
<BR>
is even...&quot; but no one should believe you because the number *doesn't
<BR>
exist*, and, if I have an infinite number of thoughts, we can see this
<BR>
NOW.
<BR>
<P>What's more, if I DON'T have an infinite number of thoughts, I can't be
<BR>
sure that I've figured out ethics yet. So if I WERE going to die, and you
<BR>
could somehow tell me what number I'll believe when I die, I'd still have
<BR>
no reason to believe it.  Who's saying that I'll necessarily have it right
<BR>
then?  Or that I'll have figured it out best?  Or that this is even the
<BR>
best I'm capable of?  Hal's parallel to physics is apropos here.  Just
<BR>
because I'll die with a certain conception of physics doesn't mean that
<BR>
it's right.  Lots of dead people got physics very wrong indeed; the same
<BR>
holds of ethics.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The empirical science of ethics is very young, so I can't tell you now
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; what sortsof empirical facts will turn out to be very relevant.  But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in some possible states of the universe you agree with S, and in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; others you disagree, and *anything* that helps me exclude some of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those possible states can inform me about whether you will agree with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; S.  If this isn't obvious to you, you haven't had a sufficient
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; introduction to information theory (e.g., decision theory) for me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; proceed.
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand the information theory well enough; what I'm contesting is
<BR>
that there *are* facts that help you exclude those &quot;possible states.&quot;  I
<BR>
put &quot;possible states&quot; in scare quotes because none of those states are
<BR>
possible on this Omega point picture.  It can neither turn out that the
<BR>
last number is odd and I'm related to bonobos, nor that the last number is
<BR>
odd and I'm related to baboons, nor that the last number is even and I'm
<BR>
related to bonobos nor that the last number is even and I'm related to
<BR>
baboons.  None of these are possible because there *is* no last number.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; In my example, the brain does *not* remember which atom it picked;that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; info is *only* encoded in that light signal.  So the analogy is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; closer. We will later be able to verify the atom mass by getting the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; light signal, and we will later be able to verify your ethical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; opinions, after the universe influences you.
</EM><BR>
<P>After the universe influences me?  On this Omega point picture, you'll
<BR>
have to wait a very long time indeed. This is akin to saying &quot;We can
<BR>
verify that the last number is even just by counting all the way up to the
<BR>
last number and checking out its ones digit.&quot;  My response? *No we can't.*
