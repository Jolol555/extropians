<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Well, there's that growth-hormone stuff, but I don't
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; know very much about that, only heard of it.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Yah, now that I think about it, I've heard of it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; too... don't think it's very commonly used though, at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; least my doctor has never turned to me and said;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &quot;we're contemplated administering the growth hormone.&quot;
</EM><BR>
<P>When I was 6 years old I was an entire size smaller than my peers. I was slight
<BR>
and short and frankly considered a runt. From that time till I was 13 I was
<BR>
given growth hormones. I knew them as thyroid pills. From age 11 till 15 I was
<BR>
considered euphemistically &quot;stocky&quot; or &quot;husky&quot; or any other term to imply a
<BR>
little bit of an over weight situation. I was no couch potato though and video
<BR>
games and pc's didn't exist so I played a lot outside. Between 10th and 11th
<BR>
grade I grew 5 inches in height. I know this sounds very very strange if not
<BR>
impossible but I have the skin stretch mark scars to prove it. I am now 200 lbs
<BR>
and 6 feet 5 inches tall. I did not stop growing until age 22. I hope this helps
<BR>
regarding the use of growth hormones.
