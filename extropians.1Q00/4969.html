<P>
NOTE: This post was sent to me by a fellow extropian who thought it
<BR>
was wrong that Joe was replying to a post of mine which did not
<BR>
concern a post of his, and the fact that Joe Dees is well aware of
<BR>
the fact that I killfiled him long ago.
<BR>
<P>From: &quot;Joe E. Dees&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:joedees@bellsouth.net?Subject=Re:%20[GUNS\%20Re:%20g*n%20c*ntr*l&In-Reply-To=&lt;200003151532.HAA08597@well.com&gt;">joedees@bellsouth.net</A>&gt;

<EM>&gt;This is a false dichotomy; I am not in favor of banning firearms 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;outright, just keeping them out of the hands of those who can be 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expected, from their mental condition or past behavior, to abuse 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the responsibility concommitant with the right to keep and bear 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;firearms.  Such a position is required of those who would call 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;themselves responsible, and should have the support of all who 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;favor responsible gun possession. To advocate the free access of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;firearms for convicted violent criminals, those who have had to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legally restrained from intimidating and abusing others, the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;incompetent and the insane is the height of irresponsibility, and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;furthermore, demonstrates a substitution of dogmatic and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;mantric progun-for-everyone rhetoric for rational reflection and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;common sense.  The world may be safer if everyone has a gun 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;than if everyone does not (although the experiences of Japan and 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Great Britain put the lie to this contention), but there can be no
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;question that the safest world of all would be the one where only 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the responsible retain the right to keep and bear, and that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;although such a utopia may be in principle impossible, we should
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;put into practice measures designed to more closely approach it.
</EM><BR>
<P>First of all no one was addressing you, or a post of yours, I
<BR>
killfiled you long ago....
<BR>
<P>Now on to the facts:
<BR>
<P>1) It is illegal for the mentally incompetent to own or possess
<BR>
firearms.
<BR>
<P>2) It is illegal for a convicted felon to own or possess a firearm.
<BR>
<P><P>Neither myself, nor any other gun owner on this list, nor the NRA,
<BR>
has ever suggested that these laws be changed, in fact we insist
<BR>
they be enforced.
<BR>
<P>3) In many states it is illegal for anyone under a restraining
<BR>
order against an ex-spouse to possess firearms.
<BR>
<P>4) Japan, the UK, Canada, Chicago and any other place where
<BR>
handguns are banned have numerous handgun deaths every year, and
<BR>
those numbers are increasing.
<BR>
<P><P>You are disingenuous, and dishonest (i.e. not to be trusted), in
<BR>
light of your behavior, I have serious doubts as to whether you
<BR>
qualify for gun ownership under item 1.
<BR>
<P>Back into the killfile with you.
<BR>
<P>Apologies to the list.
