<EM>&gt; &gt; I was thinking if with the theories just known, there is any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; possibility of teleactuating in nanoscale. For example telemoving
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; individual atoms ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; To my knowledge there are no such ways that work over macroscopic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; distances. 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The problem is that to hold an atom, you need some kind of field (most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; likely an electromagnetic field) around it, and since they tend to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fall off with the square (or more) of the distance the range is rather
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; limited.
</EM><BR>
<P>Anders, it depends what is meant by the &quot;teleactuate&quot; in this question.
<BR>
At the last Foresight conference, there was a very nice force-feedback
<BR>
AFM that you could actually *use* (very cool).  You could scan across
<BR>
and &quot;feel&quot; the bumps in the atomic surface.  Now if the &quot;tele-&quot; in
<BR>
the question is as in &quot;tele-medicine&quot;, I could easily see you controlling
<BR>
a device like this in Germany from Sweeden.  The net delays are going to
<BR>
start to get you going from Sweeden to Maryland.  If you have a direct
<BR>
connection you could probably do it to the moon, but certainly much farther
<BR>
(no way with Mars).
<BR>
<P>I'm not sure of its use though.  I thought it might be useful for
<BR>
opening nanobombs, but then I realized that nanobombs (in small
<BR>
quantities) aren't dangerous to us anyway.   They could do
<BR>
a nasty number on your AFM tip, so you are might have to replace
<BR>
those at a fairly fast rate.  Given the difficulties with this
<BR>
currently, you probably want the lab pretty close.
<BR>
<P>So I would say that the answer is yes, you could telemove individual
<BR>
with only a modest recombining of current technologies.  The jury
<BR>
is still out on psychokinesis however.  :-)
