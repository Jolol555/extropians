<EM>&gt; &gt;  I favor keeping guns out of the hands of violent criminals,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; proven intimidating abusers, and the mentally incompetent and/or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deranged, and ONLY them.  I have no problem whatsoever with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; RESPONSIBLE gun ownership by the general citizenry (I own five
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; of them).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; So then WHAT is this persistent debate about, anyway? What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; person with normal awareness of public safety requirements
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and of the incidence of human injury and death by means of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; firearms could object on rational grounds to the following?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 1] Convicted hyperaggressive felons should be denied legal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     ownership of any lethal weapon, even if the enforcement
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     of the law has intractable practical limitations.*
</EM><BR>
<P>Already the law. This is actually the easiest one to enforce, as you probably
<BR>
know from the NRA pioneered Operation Exile that took place in Richmond, and the
<BR>
effect it had on crime.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 2] Spousal or child abusers who have either been convicted
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     of aggravated assault, assault with intent, etc. or known
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     by the Child Protective or Welfare Agencies locally to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     violent by history should be likewise denied ownership.
</EM><BR>
<P>Violent by history? Who gets to make the history?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 3] Anyone denied a license to operate a motor vehicle, for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     whatever reason, should automatically be denied owner-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     ship of firearms. This would include alcoholic drivers,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     habitual  offenders and those who have thereby shown
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     a heedless and reckless disregard of the welfare, safety
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     and security of the general public.
</EM><BR>
<P>How about those physically unable to operate a car, but able to operate a gun?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 4] All individuals known to the local judicial system as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     certifiably sociopathic or ambulatory psychotic should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     denied ownership.
</EM><BR>
<P>Already the law.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 5] Hunters who have violated local laws pertaining to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     use of firearms for this purpose or otherwise engaged in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     illegal hunting practices should be denied ownership.
</EM><BR>
<P>Denying a poor rural person the only means they have to feed their families in
<BR>
bad economic times is cruel and unjustified.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 6] ANYONE known by properly constituted authority to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     legally irresponsible in the use of firearms for ANY purpose,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     including collecting, selling, trading or the mechanical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     alteration of firearms should be denied ownership.
</EM><BR>
<P>Collecting guns is a legally irresponsible behavior? Who made you god, or Freud?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 7] The retailing of firearms should be limited to, without
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     exception, state-owned stores, just as in some states
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     liquor sales are currently regulated.
</EM><BR>
<P>So when the state decides that it doesn't want people to but guns anymore it
<BR>
closes the stores. Beautiful. Extremely extropic. NOT.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 8] ALL firearms owned by private individuals should be com-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     prehensively registered with an appropriate local law-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     enforcement agency. Private trading should be banned.
</EM><BR>
<P>SO when the state decides it doesn't want you to own them anymore, it knows
<BR>
where to go to confiscate them, just as it has already done so in New York,
<BR>
California, Britain, and Australia. Banning private trade means that you ban
<BR>
private property. The state controls who owns it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 9] Penalties for first time and repeated offenders should be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     equal to or greater in severity than those that currently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     apply to violators of motor vehicle laws. A point system
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     or other device could be used to determine when a license
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     must be suspended.
</EM><BR>
<P>Since motor vehicles kill and injure far more people, even though there are
<BR>
fewer cars than guns, this is totally unjustifiable.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; 10] First time gun owners should be tested by written and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      optical exams just as motor vehicle owners are now. It
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      would not be required to be relicensed unless a violation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      of firearms laws, statutes and ordinances was a matter of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;      court record. (See -8- and -9-)
</EM><BR>
<P>Who gets to decide what the test is, and are test results going to be public
<BR>
documents?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I cannot stress enough the revulsion I feel toward those who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; reject such rational social controls on the ostensible basis of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some abstract idealist polity or manifesto using ad populum
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; terms like &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;rights&quot; to induce emotional support
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for irresponsible firearm ownership among those who are either
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; socially incompetent, illiterate or simply too immature to under-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; stand the implications of such terms when applied to the real
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; world.
</EM><BR>
<P>Then you are no extropian.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is truly astonishing that, after the perhaps 2,500-year
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; documentation of the human tendency to inflict violence on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; his own kind to achieve merely selfish ends, we still listen to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; those who advocate that some personal acquisitive desire
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; should be regarded as superordinate to the welfare of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; community upon which this individual depends. Any claim
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of privilege is forfeit by those whose very polemics are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grounded in social indifference.
</EM><BR>
<P>Considering the proof that this 'personal acquisitive desire' actually
<BR>
contributes to the safety and welfare of society, your argument is baseless. You
<BR>
start your post here off stating reasonable and normal proposals of responsible
<BR>
use, then you veer off into this wild, big brother, totalitarian rant that I
<BR>
cannot fathom the origination of. Please explain why you subscribe to this list
<BR>
instead of the more normally non-liberty based &gt;H list.
