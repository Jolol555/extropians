<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; What needs to be explained, in this view, is what would cause quint-

<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; essentially successful unicellular organisms to form communities and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually a differentiation of labor in the development of
</EM><BR>
multicellular
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; organisms such as ourselves.  Whatever the cause, the effect obviously
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; had survival value.
</EM><BR>
<P>I would not reduce everything to survival value here.  I think some
<BR>
increases in complexity are just guaranteed because of open systems (like
<BR>
Earth's biosphere) just tend to get more complex over time.  (See sources
<BR>
cited in &quot;Testing Evolutionary Explanations&quot; at my site and the Bonner book
<BR>
I mention below.)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Precisely.  Forming multicellular organisms changed the scale at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which you could operate, therefore opening up new ecological niches.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Consider the race to &quot;get big&quot; in trees.  The higher you go, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more sun you get.  Now, the transition to complex cells was driven
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; mostly likely by the difficulty of transfering large gene complexes
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of naked DNA between bacteria.  Better for one bacteria to &quot;get big&quot;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and engulf another one in its entirety (leading to mitochondria
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and chloroplasts).  The problem is that once you are &quot;big&quot; you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have to develop better partitioning systems or active transport
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to keep the diffusion of molecules in a very large space from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; slowing down your growth rate.  Even then the added complexity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gives you headaches (bacteria replicate in an hour or less, eukaryotic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cells take 18-24 hours).
</EM><BR>
<P>John Tyler Bonner goes over size and complexity increases in his _The
<BR>
Evolution of Complexity by Means of Natural Selection_.  I don't totally
<BR>
agree with his arguments -- I think he's a bit too neoDarwinian -- but one
<BR>
of his cogent arguments is that a larger size generally makes one less
<BR>
dependent on the local environment.  E.g., smaller organisms can store less
<BR>
food...:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I think calling all of this &quot;cooperation&quot; may be stretching it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a little.  We would have to nit pick on the difference between
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cooperation and symbiosis.  Particularly when the symbiosis
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; may be required for the survival of both &quot;organisms&quot;, while
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cooperation perhaps is not.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a good point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Generally, I would agree that the rise of social cooperation has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some similarities (cooperation between people changes the scale at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; which you can &quot;operate&quot;, opening up new niches in which you can survive).
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.  I would also point out that from a strict Darwinian perspective,
<BR>
competition explains cooperation but not vice versa.  I.e., one can explain
<BR>
cooperation in terms of outcompeting the non-cooperating.
