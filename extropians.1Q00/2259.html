<P>
Robin's thesis is provocative and challenging, and I don't have suggestions
<BR>
for resolving the mystery of the root causes of declining mortality.
<BR>
However one comment:  Robin writes:
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;<A HREF="http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm#fig1">http://www.cdc.gov/epo/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm4829a1.htm#fig1</A>
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And did you notice that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; US death rate doesn't seem to fall any faster after the major medical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; events the graph indicates?
</EM><BR>
<P>While this is true, it is still possible that the medical advances were
<BR>
necessary for the decline to continue.  We could draw an analogy with
<BR>
Moore's Law.  The introduction of integrated circuits, and later of very
<BR>
large scale integration, did not increase the rate of improvement in
<BR>
electronic densities.  Moore's Law has been roughly constant for many
<BR>
decades.  But we would not conclude that the various advances played
<BR>
no part in the improvement; rather, they were a necessary element in
<BR>
continuing the improvement.
<BR>
<P>In the same way, we don't know what would have happend if vaccines and
<BR>
other medical technologies had never been developed.  But I think it is
<BR>
plausible that these played a role in continuing the decline of mortality.
<BR>
If we did not have these technologies, it is possible that the factors
<BR>
leading to the earlier improvements in health (nutrition, or education,
<BR>
or whatever they turn out to be) might have reached a limit in their
<BR>
effectiveness.
