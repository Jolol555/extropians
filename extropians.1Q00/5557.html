I understand, however, that the Roman slaves did not have a nice life at 
<BR>
all.  The Greek slaves, on the other hand, were better fed, and better 
<BR>
housed.  Greeks who could not pay their dues, would enter slavery for a 
<BR>
limited time.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>Some Roman slaves had it very nice but many others did not.  Rome in the 
<BR>
imperial era was bringing in so many enslaved people to the provinces that 
<BR>
slavery would not have been quite as 'genteel' as it might have been for the 
<BR>
Greeks.  It depended on the class and also personality of the master and 
<BR>
whether they lived with a family in a great house as to slave treatment and 
<BR>
lifestyle.  Being sent to a mine owned by a noble I am sure was not a 
<BR>
desired assignment.
<BR>
<P>I have heard of Greek texts that described in detail how a master should 
<BR>
treat a slave and even respect slave family structure.  In terms of the 
<BR>
Greeks though, the question is, which city-state's slave would you be?  
<BR>
Being a slave in Sparta could be a terrifying thing with regular bouts of 
<BR>
terror and murder to maintain a strong environment of fear.
<BR>
