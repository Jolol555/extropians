<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Now consider the factual question of whether human's ancestral tribes are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; more like bonobo or baboon tribes.  You realize that this matters for human
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; ethics.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  How in heaven's name did you find out any of THAT?   ...  If I'm worried
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; about whether you committed a wrong  yesterday, then finding out the
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; empirical fact that you mugged a few innocents will help settle the question.
</EM><BR>
<P>This was just an example to introduce the notation.
<BR>
Use the mugging fact instead if that suits you better.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, you have to do some
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ethical philosophy *before* facts like those become relevant.
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But you're far away from establishing questions like deontology vs. virtue
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory, utilitarianism vs. egoism, welfarism vs. objective good, etc. none
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of which have the empirical component, and without whose resolution it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; seems unlikely that you'll know very much about ethics.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
You keep restating claims like this as if they were obvious;
<BR>
they aren't.  This is the issue we are arguing about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Let's work with a particular S, namely, that deontology is a more accurate
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; theory than virtue theory.  How would I realize that an empirical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; component would settle this question?  What sort of empirical facts would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I want to know?
</EM><BR>
<P>The empirical science of ethics is very young, so I can't tell you now what
<BR>
sortsof empirical facts will turn out to be very relevant.  But in some possible
<BR>
states
<BR>
of the universe you agree with S, and in others you disagree, and *anything*
<BR>
that helps me exclude some of those possible states can inform me about whether
<BR>
you will agree with S.   If this isn't obvious to you, you haven't had a
<BR>
sufficient
<BR>
introduction to information theory (e.g.,  decision theory) for me to proceed.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Hopefully this has all been standard so far.  Now we do the think you seem
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; to think is hard.  There are these same sets A,B,C,D with the same prior and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the same relation to S, but we drop the bonobo/baboon interpretation of A,C
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; vs. B,D.   Now A,C are the sets where I just tell you that you will now have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a 25% chance of agreeing with S, while B,D are the sets where I tell you its
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; a 33% chance.  Upon hearing this you update your beliefs to be consistent
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; with the claim I just made.  Ta da, I have fully taken into account the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; effect of my statement on you.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Excuse me?  I had those priors for a reason (presumably) and having you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tell me &quot;Your priors will be the following&quot; doesn't give me any reason, as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; such, for agreeing with you.
</EM><BR>
<P>What I know is that the universe is in states A,C, or in B,D.  Your reason
<BR>
forlistening to me is the fact that you know that I know this.  Your finding out
<BR>
which thing I said is the clue you can use to obtain my information.  If this
<BR>
doesn't make sense to you, you just don't understand information theory.
<BR>
Information is just clues that help you exclude possible states of the universe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; If you want to be clearer about verifiability, assume that the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; identity of the atom was encoded in a light beam sent off to another
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; star, and the signal would return in ten years.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; This is a very different case, IMO.  ...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; In THAT case, we could imagine that if you knew enough about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; cognitive science, you could analyze the current physical state of my
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; brain to determine my current beliefs about which atom I'd chosen,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; determine the mass of that atom, and report it.  All purely empirical.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However, my [future] beliefs are *not* fully determinable based on the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; current state of my brain.  My beliefs have been informed both by my
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; own internal cogitations as well as things which happen TO me,
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; things which you can't predict merely by looking at my brain.  So this
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt; analogy *definitely* doesn't carry over in this case.
</EM><BR>
<P>In my example, the brain does *not* remember which atom it picked;that info is
<BR>
*only* encoded in that light signal.  So the analogy is closer.
<BR>
We will later be able to verify the atom mass by getting the light signal,
<BR>
and we will later be able to verify your ethical opinions, after the
<BR>
universe influences you.
