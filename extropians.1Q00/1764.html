<P>
The following is an announcement that my friend Steve Flinn has asked that I 
<BR>
pass on to the list.  I encourage folks with the interest and requisite 
<BR>
skills to contact Steve.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;&lt;}{&gt;
<BR>
<P>ManyWorlds Consulting, Inc. is looking for talented individuals to assist us 
<BR>
in developing a commercial content management software package, AdaptiveConten
<BR>
t™, that has the potential to revolutionize knowledge-based Internet portal 
<BR>
development and management. 
<BR>
<P>ManyWorlds is focused on helping its clients create &quot;blow-out&quot; value for 
<BR>
their shareholders, through delivery of what we call Business Model 
<BR>
Solutions™.  Business Model Solutions includes assisting with business 
<BR>
strategy formulation, as well as delivering key process and IT components 
<BR>
that enable the strategy.
<BR>
Clients range from leading companies such as Cisco Systems and Royal 
<BR>
Dutch/Shell Group to very high potential start-ups. 
<BR>
<P>We are a company that embraces extropian/transhumanist principles, and Max 
<BR>
More is currently assisting us in the development of what will be the leading 
<BR>
business strategy hub on the Internet, which will be launched on February 14. 
<BR>
&nbsp;The first generation of AdaptiveContent will be generating that portal.
<BR>
<P>We are already at work architecting next generation capabilities of 
<BR>
AdaptiveContent.  We need additional application development talent, with 
<BR>
particular expertise in database-driven web applications.  Deep expertise 
<BR>
with SQL/Server and ASP is a must.   We would be interested in hiring 
<BR>
individuals with the right skill sets on a full-time or part-time basis, and 
<BR>
as either an employee or on an independent contractor basis. You can be 
<BR>
located just about anywhere in the world, as long as you have access to a 
<BR>
high-speed Internet connection (our headquarters is in Houston, TX).  Our 
<BR>
preference is for people who are available to work with us in the very 
<BR>
near-term.
<BR>
<P>We would also be interested in discussing our technology with individuals or 
<BR>
companies that might be interested in developing applications that complement 
<BR>
the core AdaptiveContent package.  We would be prepared to help market your 
<BR>
applications to our customers. 
<BR>
<P>If interested, send me an e-mail at s.flinn@manyworlds.com.    
<BR>
<P>Steve Flinn
<BR>
President
<BR>
ManyWorlds Consulting, Inc.
