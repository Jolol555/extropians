Comparing it to &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; is like comparing Jewel's poems to 
<BR>
those of Blake. :)

<BR>
<P>Wow, that is really saying something!  Jewel is not too well liked in Alaska 
<BR>
after she denied being an Alaskan in a California interview.  The local 
<BR>
radiostations mock her and there was a &quot;I used to know Jewel before she was 
<BR>
famous&quot; article in a paper that wasn't too flattering.  She cancelled her 
<BR>
last concert here which put the final nail in her coffin.
<BR>
<P>you continue:
<BR>
But even if the film were good, it would not be like &quot;2001&quot; simply because 
<BR>
Kubrick was going down a different path. (If you wanta film that's similar 
<BR>
to &quot;2001,&quot; see Takovsky's &quot;Solaris.&quot;)
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I have seen _Solaris_ and own a copy of the video.  I had a hard time 
<BR>
initially getting into it but then got hooked into the story.  It was very 
<BR>
eerie realizing what was going on.  Some friends of mine called it boring 
<BR>
but never gave it a chance.
<BR>
<P>Another great Russian film is _Stalker_ and tells the story of some sort of 
<BR>
meteorite that somehow 'warped' the reality around the crashsite in an 
<BR>
everchanging way.  A 'tourguide' takes a small group into the forbidden 
<BR>
area.  This film is excellent and very philosophical.
<BR>
