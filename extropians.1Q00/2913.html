From: &quot;Robert J. Bradbury&quot; &lt;<A HREF="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com?Subject=Re:%20Easy%20ways%20to%20DE-orbit&In-Reply-To=&lt;v03110700b4d0a6cd45a8@[149.217.0.151]&gt;">bradbury@aeiveos.wa.com</A>&gt; Mon, 14 Feb 2000:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Well, Amara, I've got a picture of you sitting at your desk (from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the Proceedings of the '88 Interstellar Dust conference) and I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;say from the looks of things we can safely say that you and Spike
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;probably belong to the same stellar class.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Nothing like having a 12 year old picture come back and hit you ...
<BR>
(I look rather different now, but that's OK)
<BR>
<P>Yes, I already told Spike that if he's a nerd, then I'm a nerd-ess.
<BR>
<P>(however, girl scientists are just naturally cute, so it's a little
<BR>
bit harder for girl scientists to be as nerdy as boy scientists)
<BR>
<P>And for the record.. that old picture of me at my desk at NASA-Ames
<BR>
was posed. I put a dewar of liquid nitrogen behind my old Mac, to
<BR>
the right, which I had hoped would give off a &quot;smoke-like&quot; effect behind
<BR>
the computer. However, to my huge disappointment, it didn't show up in
<BR>
the photograph.  All of the rest of the &quot;mess&quot; around my desk, I created
<BR>
artificially too, to try to show the &quot;frantic activity&quot; that was necessary
<BR>
to produce the book.  (I did all of the typesetting of the book, and alot
<BR>
of the editing. I basically lived and breathed that book for about
<BR>
a year. Our IAU Symposium 135, Interstellar Dust book was one of
<BR>
the very first Kluwer Academic Press Symposium books to be all
<BR>
in LaTeX, before Kluwer had LaTeX macros to give to people, and so
<BR>
another fellow and I wrote all  of the LaTeX book macros)
<BR>
<P>It's a great book, actually. I like it, even better now than 12
<BR>
years ago. At the time I worked on it, I thought that the topic
<BR>
of interstellar dust was a really boring topic. I never would
<BR>
have thought that 12 years later, I would be earning my PhD
<BR>
in the interplanetary dust field...
<BR>
<P>Dust drives the Universe, you know...:-)
<BR>
<P>Amara
<BR>
<P>P.S. I'll pass for the moment on the &quot;Easy ways to orbit&quot; topic. I've
<BR>
spent the last several days with ESA Earth spacecraft debris folks, learning
<BR>
about all of the ways that particles can DE-Orbit, and my brain is full.
<BR>
<P>P.P.S. I'm in the middle of (TeX) typesetting _another_ dust book- this
<BR>
time with my advisor as one of the editors, the topic is interplanetary
<BR>
dust, and the book will be published by University of Arizona Press.
<BR>
It will be the &quot;definitive interplanetary dust text book&quot;. (that's the idea,
<BR>
anyway...)  Look for it later this year in your favorite scientific/astronomy
<BR>
bookstore.
