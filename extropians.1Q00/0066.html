<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems that you are missing the dichotomy between transhumanism and
<BR>
Extropianism.  It can be said that all Extropians are transhumanists, but
<BR>
not vice versa; in fact, I once worked on a transhumanist project whose
<BR>
editor was vehemently anti-Extropian.  An Extropian is generally in
<BR>
alliegance with the principles written by Max, and has a vested interest in
<BR>
where mankind is going, and how we get there.  A transhumanist generally
<BR>
seeks to transcend the boundaries of the present, opting for a
<BR>
technologically quickened future, while retaining the sense of humanism.
<BR>
The methods and perspectives of how to attain the ideals vary widely.  It
<BR>
is all written out clearly on www.extropy.org, as well as many other
<BR>
transhumanist and Extropian sites.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Eliezer, I'm still unclear on what you mean by the 'politicizing' of
<BR>
the transhumanist movement and why we must &quot;...descen[d] into provincialism
<BR>
and disunity.&quot;  Neither transhumanism or Extropianism is a politic...there
<BR>
was a good thread on this a few months ago which should be in the archives
<BR>
at the Extropy website.  If this isn't what you mean, please explain.
