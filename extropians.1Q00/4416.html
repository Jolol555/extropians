<P><EM>&gt; Anders wrote,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Reminds me a bit of agronomy. I see it more as a science than a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;technology - the science of freeing people. The problem is of course
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that we have no idea what such a technology would be at present. A
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;great deal of philosophy, psychology and sociology would likely be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;involved, perhaps also economics. But at present we only have a few
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;scattered ideas about what it would be, and a few tools for it. Hmm,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;we better get working on inventing it! :-)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Yes, indeed we had better get working on it. How shall we start? I'd like to ask
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if humanity has taken a wrong turn. One that has led to tyranny and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; superstition.
</EM><BR>
<P>Where could it have made the turn? I think the only obvious point
<BR>
where humanity might have made a truly irreversible choice is the
<BR>
development of agriculture. Once you have it, a lot of things change:
<BR>
population increase, cultural changes, plagues and cities become hard
<BR>
to avoid (?). If we somehow had avoided it and remained
<BR>
hunter-gatherers humanity would have remained stable. Now we have got
<BR>
onto the change track instead.
<BR>
<P>Without cities tyrants will just tyrranize their tribe and their
<BR>
neighbours, but clearly tyrrany is older than cities and would still
<BR>
have been present in a hunter-gatherer humanity. In fact, when we look
<BR>
at our primate relatives we find quite a bit of tyrrany going on, so
<BR>
the reasons for tyrrany seems to go back far into our evolutionary
<BR>
past. Increased technology and population has just made tyrants more
<BR>
effective.
<BR>
<P>Superstition (I define it as doing and thinking things there are no
<BR>
compelling reasons to think they are correct) is also much older than
<BR>
agriculture. If cave paintings were intended to improve the hunt
<BR>
magically (as opposed to give instruction or act as decoration) then
<BR>
we have at least 50,000 years of superstition. And there have been
<BR>
signs of ceremonial burial of neanderthal humans with flowers and
<BR>
tools, suggesting a belief in an afterlife around 70,000 years ago.
<BR>
<P>Anumals can easily become superstitious when given operant training -
<BR>
if you intermittently reward a pidgeon for pecking at a certain
<BR>
symbol, and it happens to stand on one leg when it gets a reward, it
<BR>
sometimes develop the association &quot;symbol peck + one leg = reward&quot; and
<BR>
will always stand on one leg. I expect that we have had superstition
<BR>
long before we climbed down from the trees.
<BR>
<P>So tyrrany and superstition are really older than Homo sapiens. They
<BR>
are not something we chose and fell out from a golden age, but rather
<BR>
something we want to get rid of to reach a future golden age.
