The NY Times has an article today about a book out last month, Rare
<BR>
Earth by paleontologist Peter D. Ward and astronomer Donald C. Brownlee.
<BR>
The book's thesis is that advanced multicellular life is likely to be
<BR>
very rare in the cosmos.
<BR>

and if it asks you for an account, use &quot;cpunks&quot; and &quot;cpunks&quot; for username

<BR>
<P>Here is the part of the article where they describe the specific
<BR>
arguments.  Most of these we have seen before, but perhaps not all
<BR>
brought together in one place.  I wonder if the book actually does any
<BR>
quantitative estimates using the Drake Equation or something similar.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Ward said he was drawn to the topic because of his studies of mass
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;extinctions. Increasingly, top culprits are seen as speeding rocks
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from outer space that hit Earth in huge explosions, with one 65 million
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;years ago killing off many plants and animals, including the dinosaurs.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New studies, Dr. Ward said, suggest that things could be worse. For
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instance, the rate of terrestrial impacts could be as much as 10,000
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;times higher but for the presence of Jupiter, the solar system's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;largest planet, which absorbs many killer rocks and flings others
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;into deep space.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're right on the edge of the abyss,&quot; Dr. Ward said, in terms of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;higher bombardment rates that have probably precluded the development
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of advanced life.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent finds of giant Jupiterlike planets outside the solar system
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offer no solace. Most of their orbits, he said, are wildly eccentric,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which would abet destructive chaos among smaller planets rather than
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shielding them.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;All the Jupiters seen today are bad Jupiters,&quot; Dr. Ward said of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;31 finds to date. &quot;Ours is the only good one we know of. And it's
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;got to be good, or you're thrown out into dark space or into your sun.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Marcy, the planet finder, said such analyses were adding to his
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubts about the existence of extraterrestrials.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Ward said that even if some distant Jupiters were found to be in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stable, circular orbits, other factors might overwhelm their protective
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect and demolish any life. For instance, closer to the center
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the galaxy where star populations are far denser, the frequent
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;passage of one star past another could trigger cascades of comets,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trillions of which are thought to orbit the icy fringes of most stars.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you're in the interior of the galaxy,&quot; Dr. Ward said, &quot;you're
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;always getting bombarded.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Added to that fury, he said, is the intense radiation and explosions
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of galactic interiors. The star-filled sky conveys a false impression
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of immutability.  New studies show that the cosmos, especially galactic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;centers, are hotbeds of violence swept by killing waves of X-rays,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gamma rays and ionizing radiation.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;So I don't think there's any life in the centers at all,&quot; Dr. Ward
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dr. Brownlee, the astronomer and co-author, said the odds for complex
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life were similarly bad at galactic edges.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The analysis of starlight from the fringes shows they are relatively
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;poor in elements like iron, magnesium and silicon, partly because of
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less recycling of stellar materials over the eons and partly because
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the rarity in such regions of supernovas, the stellar blasts that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;help make heavy elements in enormously hot explosions.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These elements, Dr. Brownlee said, and even heavier ones that are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;radioactive and also made in supernovas, appear to be prerequisites
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to the formation of terrestrial-type planets that have sufficient
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gravity to retain seas and atmospheres and that have plate tectonics,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which is powered largely by the heat of radioactive decay.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the book, the slow movement and recycling of planetary
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crust into a planet's hot interior are key ingredients for the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;evolution of complex life. Plate tectonics, the authors say,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;promotes biodiversity by producing mountain chains and other kinds
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of environmental complexity, lessens the odds of extinctions, helps
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep planetary temperatures even through the recycling of carbon and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makes dry land on which advanced civilizations can flourish.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We're critically dependent on mass,&quot; said Dr. Brownlee. &quot;Being bigger
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or smaller might rule out plate tectonics.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole galaxies are metal-poor and therefore probably devoid of animal
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;life, Dr. Brownlee added. Only spiral galaxies like the Milky Way and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its nearby neighbor in Andromeda appear rich in metals, and even then,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;only in their inner regions. In contrast, elliptical and irregular
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;galaxies, he said, are barren.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lower metal abundance means you can't make a planet as big as the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earth,&quot; Dr. Brownlee said. &quot;It seems like something a lot of people
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;don't want to hear.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The scientists discuss other planetary characteristics that are
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probably rare in the universe but are increasingly seen as critical
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for making Earth so favorable to complex life. Among them are these:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*An orbit that keeps a planet at exactly the right distance from its
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;star to ensure that water remains liquid, not vapor or ice.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*A large moon at just the right distance to minimize changes in a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;planet's tilt, ensuring climate stability.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*Enough carbon to aid the development of life but not so much to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;allow for runaway greenhouse conditions, as occur on superheated Venus.
