<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Our government (US) is trying to wipe all out all privacy on the net, and 
<BR>
barely anyone is rasing an eyebrow.  AOL has even jumped in to say they 
<BR>
will help the federal police in any way to assure such a Big Brother 
<BR>
surveillance system becomes a reality.
<BR>
<P>This has got to be the most draconian proposal yet in the history of the 
<BR>
net, and no one appears to be getting upset. What gives?  Why is it I seem 
<BR>
the only one very chilled by this prospect?
