<EM>&gt; &gt; What you describe is a situation in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; which Extropians found themselves outlawed, or at least officially
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; prohibited from engaging in their practice.  In the Western democracies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; this would not be a political but a constitutional (i.e. legal) issue, and if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; there was a remedy, it would be found in the courts, and not in social
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; or political action.

<EM>&gt; Robert, if you accept the general premise that a THism/EIism philosophy
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; is one that allows indefinate extension of ones longevity, then one may
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; also want to accept that one should have a choice as to when to end
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your conscious life.  Currently that is legally prohibited in all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but one state and a couple of countries.

<P>Dear Robert,
<BR>
<P>Right now I want to emphasize two things: [1] my propositions with
<BR>
respect to euthanasia had in fact the form of contrafactual condi-
<BR>
tionals; I personally endorse without qualification your position that
<BR>
it is a travesty of democratic principles to deny citizens freedom of
<BR>
choice with respect to the voluntary termination (or suspension) of
<BR>
biological life.
<BR>
<P>[2] I take the hypothetical threats mentioned by you and others to
<BR>
the realization of Transhumanist aims quite seriously; I do not over-
<BR>
look the possibility of a constitutional crisis but simply assess that
<BR>
threat on a comparative basis -- for example, if the use of a potent
<BR>
bacteriological agent such as Anthrax-B against the United States
<BR>
by a foreign power is assigned a threat-value (relative to Extropians
<BR>
and everyone else) of 1.00, what value is to be assigned to, say, the
<BR>
implementation of the adoption of a constitutional ammendment by
<BR>
a massive and politically sophisticated coalition of religious conserva-
<BR>
tives that compromised access to the technologies needed to practice
<BR>
Extropianism?
<BR>
<P>My estimate -- and of course it is merely that -- would be something
<BR>
like 0.125, at most 0.20.  Of course this number represents a distinct
<BR>
possibility, and I chose this case because it illustrates what almost
<BR>
certainly is the Achilles' heel of Extropianism -- namely the dependence
<BR>
on technology access to and utilization of which it cannot control.
<BR>
<P>What this suggests to me is not a need for political action but the
<BR>
consideration of the possibility of private ownership of the requisite
<BR>
technology by an incorporation of Transhumanist interests. If you
<BR>
reply that this leaves the possibility of expropriation by the State
<BR>
open, I must agree.  But at what point do we desist from the pro-
<BR>
jection of possible impediments and get on with it?
<BR>
