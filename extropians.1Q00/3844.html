<P>
Natasha drew
<BR>
<P>Amara doodled
<BR>
<P>Greg 5-D'd
<BR>
<P>Lucky buggers. Here's one of my recurrent obsessions: I believe most people
<BR>
take it for granted that everyone else in the world uses roughly the same
<BR>
kind of mental imagery protocols. We all know enough to distinguish
<BR>
extroverts from shy cerebrotonics, and the jocks from the willowy sensitive
<BR>
types, and the inarticulate from the freely babbling, but since the early
<BR>
1960s, when I had an epiphany about all this, I've been informally polling
<BR>
people about their visual imagery. 
<BR>
<P>Most can form some kind of red triangle in imagination, and rotate it to
<BR>
the left, then to the right, and go on to make a picture of their dear old
<BR>
Maman, check the color of her eyes, and so on. Some are exceptionally good
<BR>
at this stunt, making elaborate flowcharts and tracking through them
<BR>
without moving a muscle (or maybe they twitch in sympathy). Others can
<BR>
`see' whole movies as they read a novel. 
<BR>
<P>Me, I've got *zero* visual imagery.
<BR>
<P>The module's not there, apparently.
<BR>
<P>This is presumably one reason I was regarded as a cretin in primary and
<BR>
most of secondary school. I couldn't spell very well, because I couldn't
<BR>
inwardly *see* the words. Eventually I managed to recognize stuff on the
<BR>
page, but answering `spelling bee' questions was utterly hopeless. Even
<BR>
though I soon knew five times as many words as everyone else, and more or
<BR>
less how to use them, I could not spell them orally because I couldn't *see
<BR>
them inwardly* (whatever the hell that is).
<BR>
<P>Same thing with simple arithmetic and algebra, let alone geometry.
<BR>
Hopeless. Scribble scribble, tongue out the corner of my mouth, maybe by
<BR>
brute force I could work out what the fuck they were babbling about, but so
<BR>
much teaching was automatically pitched in the visualization mode that I
<BR>
was repeatedly stranded.
<BR>
<P>So I never became a scientist, to my intense regret. I didn't hack it as a
<BR>
philosopher, either, once the notation started to dance on the blackboard.
<BR>
I need to turn everything into narrative, run compression algorithms on the
<BR>
word chunks, then fool around with those. This can be amazingly powerful,
<BR>
and many poststructuralists do just this, hence sound like posing wankers -
<BR>
and I suspect many of them must share my cognitive defect. Not all, though,
<BR>
now that movies and visual art and TV are such a major part of the pomo
<BR>
agenda.
<BR>
<P>This has a very strange effect on my writing. Since I write a fair bit of
<BR>
fiction, often set in places where the settings are unfamiliar, I need to
<BR>
provide the cues and codes that switch on my readers' visual imagery
<BR>
machinery. Since that stuff doesn't work with me, from the inside, I'm in
<BR>
roughly the position of a deaf person learning to grunt out sounds
<BR>
painfully associated with meanings, with hardly any immediate feedback.
<BR>
It's weird, I tell you.
<BR>
<P>And I reckon a lot of those smart people who never quite `achieved their
<BR>
potential' might have the same imagery structures as mine, or maybe other
<BR>
kinds that are equally alien.
<BR>
<P>I'd like to hear from anyone else here with odd internal-imagery
<BR>
modalities. (I should add that I seem to use a kind of ancillary
<BR>
kinesthetic imagery, with bits of my body image *feeling* rotated, etc, in
<BR>
space; so I can score fairly well on those
<BR>
rotate-the-gadget-and-say-which-one-is-next tests in IQ trials, by turning
<BR>
myself into one and dancing. I almost immediately knew the answer to one
<BR>
famous question about tetrahedra, cited in an A. C. Clarke novel, that only
<BR>
geniuses are supposed to get. But I'm damned if I can *picture* a
<BR>
tetrahedron in my head...)
