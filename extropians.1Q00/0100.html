<P>IDEOLOGICAL FREEWARE: DISTRIBUTE AT WILL
<BR>
<P>The Manifesto of January 3, 2000
<BR>
<P><P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 1914, the lamps went out all over Europe.
<BR>
Life  during the rest of the twentieth century was
<BR>
like crouching under a rock.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But human life is not required to be like the
<BR>
twentieth century.   That wasn't fate, it was merely
<BR>
a historical  circumstance.   In this new Belle Epoque,
<BR>
this delightful era, we are experiencing a prolonged break
<BR>
in the last century's even tenor of mayhem.  The time has
<BR>
come to step out of those shadows into a different
<BR>
cultural reality.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We  need a sense of revived possibility, of genuine
<BR>
creative potential, of unfeigned joie de vivre.  We have a
<BR>
new economy, but we have no new  intelligentsia.  We have
<BR>
massive flows of information and capital, but we have a
<BR>
grave scarcity of meaning.  We know what we can buy, but
<BR>
we don't know what we want.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The twentieth century featured any number of -isms.
<BR>
They were fatally based on the delusion that philosophy
<BR>
trumps engineering.   It doesn't.  In a world fully
<BR>
competent to command its material basis, ideology is
<BR>
inherently flimsy.   &quot;Technology&quot; in its broad sense:
<BR>
the ability to transform resources, the speed at which new
<BR>
possibilities can be opened and exploited, the multiple
<BR>
and various forms of command-and-control  -- technology,
<BR>
not ideology, is the twentieth century's lasting legacy.
<BR>
Technology broke the gridlock of the five-decade Cold War.
<BR>
It made a new era thinkable.  And, finally, technology
<BR>
made a new era obvious.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But too many twentieth-century technologies
<BR>
are very  like twentieth-century ideologies:  rigid,
<BR>
monolithic, poisonous and non-sustainable.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need clean, supple, healthy means of support for
<BR>
a crowded world.   We need recyclable technologies,
<BR>
industries that don't take themselves with that
<BR>
Stalinesque seriousness that demands the brutal sacrifice
<BR>
of millions.  In order to make flimsy, supple technologies
<BR>
thinkable, and then achievable, then finally obvious, we
<BR>
need an ideology that embraces  its own obsolescence.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The immediate future won't be a period suitable for
<BR>
building monuments, establishing thousand-year regimes,
<BR>
creating new-model citizens, or asserting leaden
<BR>
certainties about anything whatsoever.   The immediate
<BR>
future is about picking and choosing among previously
<BR>
unforeseen technical potentials.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our time calls for intelligent fads.  Our time calls
<BR>
for a self-aware, highly temporary array of broad social
<BR>
experiments, whose effects are localized, non-lethal and
<BR>
reversible -- yet transparent, and visible to all parties
<BR>
who might be persuaded to look.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Internet is the natural test-bed for this
<BR>
fast-moving, fast-vanishing, start-up society.  Because
<BR>
the  native technology of the coming years is not the 19th
<BR>
century &quot;machine&quot; or the 20th century &quot;product.&quot;   It is
<BR>
the 21st century &quot;gizmo.&quot;
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A gizmo is a device with so  many features and so
<BR>
many promises that it can never be  mastered within its
<BR>
own useful lifetime. A gizmo is  flimsy, cheap, colorful,
<BR>
friendly, intriguing, easily  disposable, and unlikely to
<BR>
harm the user.   The gizmo's  purpose is not to
<BR>
efficiently perform some function or  effectively provide
<BR>
some service.  A gizmo exists to snag  the user's
<BR>
attention, and to engage the user in a vast
<BR>
unfolding nexus of interlinked experience.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gizmo in its manifold aspects is the beau ideal
<BR>
for contemporary design and engineering. Because that is
<BR>
what our culture will be like, at its heart, in its bones,
<BR>
in its organs.  A gizmo culture.  We will go in so many
<BR>
directions at once that most of them will never see
<BR>
fulfillment.  And then they will be gone.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is confusing and seems lacking in moral
<BR>
seriousness -- but only only by the  rigid standards of
<BR>
the past century, bitterly obsessed  with  ultimate
<BR>
efficiencies and malignant final solutions.    We need
<BR>
opportunities now, not efficiencies.   We need inspired
<BR>
improvisation, not solutions. Technology can no  longer
<BR>
bind us in a vast tonnage of iron, barbed wire and brick.
<BR>
We will stop heaving balky machines  uphill. Instead, we
<BR>
begin  judging entire techno-complexes as they virtually
<BR>
unfold,  judging them by standards that are, in some very
<BR>
basic  sense, aesthetic.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, it is humans and human flesh that lasts
<BR>
out the years,  not the mechanical infrastructure.   Our
<BR>
bodies outlast  our machines, and our bodies outlast our
<BR>
beliefs.  People will outlive this &quot;revolution&quot;  -- if
<BR>
spared an apocalypse, human individuals will outlive every
<BR>
&quot;technology&quot; that we are capable of deploying.   Waves of
<BR>
techno-change will come faster and faster, and with less
<BR>
and less permanent consequence.  Waves will be arriving
<BR>
with the somnolent regularity of Waikiki breakers.   This
<BR>
&quot;revolution&quot; does not replace one social order with
<BR>
another. It replaces social order with an array of further
<BR>
possible transformations.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since gizmos are easily outmoded and inherently
<BR>
impermanent, their most graceful form is as  disposable
<BR>
consumer technology.  We should embrace those  gizmos that
<BR>
are pleasing, abject, humble, and closest to  the human
<BR>
body.  We should spurn those that are remote, difficult,
<BR>
threatening, poisonous and brittle.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of all, we must never, ever again feel awestruck
<BR>
wonder about any manufactured device. They don't last,
<BR>
and are not worthy of that form of respect.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must engage with technology in a new way, from a
<BR>
fresh  perspective.   The arts traditionally hold this
<BR>
critical position.  The arts are in a position today to
<BR>
inspire a burst of cultural vitality across the board.
<BR>
The times are very propitious for the arts.  There's a
<BR>
profound restlessness, there's money loose, there are new
<BR>
means of display and communication, and the nouveau riche
<BR>
have nothing to wear and nothing that suits their walls.
<BR>
It's a golden opportunity for techno-dandyism.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Artists, don't be afraid of commercialization.  The
<BR>
sovereign remedy for commercialization is not for artists
<BR>
to hide  from commerce.  That can't be done any more, and
<BR>
in any case, hiding never wins and strong artists don't
<BR>
live in fear.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead, we have a new remedy available.  The
<BR>
aggressive counter-action to commodity totalitarianism is
<BR>
to give things away.  Not other people's property -- that
<BR>
would be, sad to say, &quot;piracy&quot; -- but the products of your
<BR>
own imagination, your own creative effort.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the time to be thoughtful, be expressive, be
<BR>
generous.  Be &quot;taken advantage of.&quot;   The channels exist
<BR>
now to give creativity away, at no cost, to millions.
<BR>
Never mind if you make  large sums of money along the way.
<BR>
If you successfully seize attention, nothing is more
<BR>
likely.  In a start-up society, huge sums can fall on
<BR>
innocent parties, almost by accident.   That cannnot be
<BR>
helped,  so don't worry about it any more.  Henceforth,
<BR>
artistic integrity should be  judged, not by one's classic
<BR>
bohemian seclusion from  satanic mills and the grasping
<BR>
bourgeoisie, but by what  one creates and gives away.
<BR>
That is the only scale of noncommercial integrity that
<BR>
makes any sense now.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom has to be won, and, more importantly, the
<BR>
consequences of  freedom have to be lived.  You do not win
<BR>
freedom of information by filching data from a corporate
<BR>
warehouse, or begging the authorities to kindly abandon
<BR>
their monopolies, copyrights and patents.  You have to
<BR>
create that freedom by a deliberate act of will,  think it
<BR>
up, assemble it, sacrifice for it, make it free to others
<BR>
who have a similar will to live that freedom.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivory towers are no longer in order.  We need ivory
<BR>
networks.  Today, sitting quietly and thinking is  the
<BR>
world's greatest generator of wealth and prosperity.
<BR>
Moguls spend their lives sitting in chairs, staring into
<BR>
screens, and occasionally clicking a mouse. Though we
<BR>
didn't expect it, we're all on the same net.  We no longer
<BR>
need feudal shelters to  protect us from the swords and
<BR>
torches of barbarian ignorance. So show  them words and
<BR>
images: make it obvious, let them look.  If  they're
<BR>
interested, fine; if not, go pick another website.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The structure of human intellectual achievement
<BR>
should be reformatted,  so that any human being with a
<BR>
sincere interest can learn as much as possible, as rapidly
<BR>
as their abilities allow.   The Internet is the greatest
<BR>
accomplishment of the twentieth century's scientific
<BR>
community, and the Internet has made a new intelligentsia
<BR>
possible.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the scientific method, the Internet is a
<BR>
genuine, workable, verifiable means of intellectual
<BR>
liberation.  Don't worry if it's not universal. Awareness
<BR>
can't be doled out like soup, or sold like soap.
<BR>
Intellectual vitality is an inherently internal, self-
<BR>
actualizing process.    The net must make this possible
<BR>
for people, not by blasting flags and gospel at the
<BR>
masses, but by opening doors for individual minds, who
<BR>
will then pursue their own interests.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This can be made to happen.  It is quite near to us
<BR>
now, the trends favor it.  The consequences of genuine
<BR>
intellectual  freedom are literally and rightfully
<BR>
unimaginable.  But  the unimaginable is the right thing to
<BR>
do.  The  unimaginable is far better than perfection,
<BR>
because  perfection can never be achieved, and it would
<BR>
kill us if  it were.  Whereas the &quot;unimaginable&quot; is, at
<BR>
its root, merely a healthy measure of our own limitations.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human beings are imperfect and imperfectable, and
<BR>
their networks even more so.  We should probably be happy
<BR>
for the noise and disruption in the channel, since so much
<BR>
of what we think we know, and love to teach, are mistakes
<BR>
and lies.   But nevertheless, we can achieve progress
<BR>
here.  We can remove some modicum of the fatal, choking
<BR>
constraints that throughout centuries  have bent people
<BR>
double.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A human mind in pursuit of self-actualization should
<BR>
be allowed to go as far and as fast as our means allow.
<BR>
There is nothing utopian about this program; because
<BR>
there no timeless justice or perfect stability to be found
<BR>
in this vision.     This practice will not lead us toward
<BR>
any dream, any City on a Hill, any phony form of static
<BR>
bliss.  On the contrary, it will lead us into closer and
<BR>
closer, into more and more immediate contact, with the
<BR>
issues that really bedevil us.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before many more decades pass, the human race will
<BR>
begin to obtain what it really wants.  Then we will find
<BR>
ourselves confronted, in our bedrooms, streets, and
<BR>
breakfast tables, with real-world avatars of those
<BR>
Faustian visions of power and ability that have previously
<BR>
existed only in myth.  Our  aspirations will become
<BR>
consequences.  That's when our *real* trouble starts.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, that is not a contemporary problem.  The
<BR>
problems we face today are not those somber, long-term
<BR>
problems.   On the contrary, we very clearly exist in a
<BR>
highly fortunate time with very minor problems.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The so-called human condition won't survive the
<BR>
next hundred years.  That fate is written on the forehead
<BR>
of the 21st century in letters of fire.  That fate can be
<BR>
wisely shaped, or somewhat postponed, or brutally
<BR>
annihilated, but it cannot be denied.   It is coming
<BR>
because we want it.  It's not an alien imposition; it is
<BR>
borne  from the inchoate depths of our own desires.
<BR>
But we're not beyond the limits of humanity, suffering
<BR>
that, exulting in that.  We're just going there, visibly
<BR>
moving closer to it.  Once we get there, we'll find no
<BR>
rest there.  The appetite of divine discontent always
<BR>
grows by the feeding.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This dire knowledge makes today's scene seem quite
<BR>
playful and delightful by faux-retrospect.  Our worst
<BR>
problems, which may seem so large, diffuse, and morbid,
<BR>
are mere teenage angst compared to the conundrums we're
<BR>
busily preparing for some other generation.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sober assessment of the contemporary scene makes it
<BR>
crystal-clear that a carnival atmosphere is in order.  We
<BR>
exist in a highly disposable civilization that is hell-
<BR>
bent on outmoding itself.  The pace of change is melting
<BR>
former physical restraints into a maelstrom of
<BR>
reformattable virtualities.  That's here, it's real,
<BR>
it is truly our situation.   We should live as
<BR>
if we know this is true.  This is where our own sincerity
<BR>
and authenticity are to be found:  in the strong
<BR>
conviction that the contemporary is temporary.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We need to live in these conditions in good faith.
<BR>
We need to re-imagine life and make the new implications
<BR>
clear.  It's a murky situation, but we must  not flinch
<BR>
from it; we must drench all of it in light.  Because  this
<BR>
is our home.  We have no other.  Our children live  here.
<BR>
The mushroom clouds of the twentieth century have  parted.
<BR>
We find ourselves on a  beach, with wave after  frothy
<BR>
wave of transformation.   We have means, motive,  and
<BR>
opportunity.  Spread the light.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, it will make more and more sense to
<BR>
base our deepest convictions around a hands-on
<BR>
confrontation with the consequences of technology.
<BR>
That's where the action is.  On January 3, 2000, that's
<BR>
what it's about.  The deepest resources of human
<BR>
creativity have a vital role there.  It's where
<BR>
inspiration is most needed, it's the place to make a
<BR>
difference.    Come  out.  Stand up.  Shine.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turn the lamps on all over the world.
