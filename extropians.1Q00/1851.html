<EM>&gt; Interestingly, your last sentence sounds like what the geometers had to say,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but they were talking about ars rei, the &quot;art of the thing&quot;, more recently
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; known as algebra.

<P>I don't deny that. And if some mathematical 'handles' on this stuff were to be 
<BR>
created, more work would be done on it. I'm personally fairly down on the 
<BR>
entire scheme of Neural Nets, due to the inability of being able to certify a 
<BR>
Neural Net solution as being stable or accurate (All you can do is statistics, 
<BR>
proof is not possible), but some recent work (which I don't have a pointer to --
<BR>
wish I did) at automatically converting to/from Neural Nets and Prolog-like 
<BR>
languages holds out some hope for not only being able to verify that a Neural 
<BR>
Net is gonna do what we hope, but that we will eventually gain the tools to 
<BR>
analyze natural neural nets.
