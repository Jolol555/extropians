<EM>&gt; &gt; Regarding the current gun debate and all previous incarnations, why
</EM><BR>
bother?
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Aside from venting -- which, in itself is counterproductive; people who
</EM><BR>
vent
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; only vent again; they don't move to some new equilibrium -- do any of
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; really think you're going to persuade someone on this list?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Good point, however people _do_ change their attitude over time.
</EM><BR>
<P>I did not ever claim they don't.  What I mean is this latest gun debate is
<BR>
not going to change anyone's mind.  I think it is counterproductive at best,
<BR>
sheer idiocy at worst.  It seems like everyone has to chime in with their
<BR>
point of view -- to make sure no one wrongly classifies them.  (I've avoided
<BR>
these debates for the most part, but I'm on a caffeine high right now -- and
<BR>
it ain't from coffee, mind you.  Dark chocolate covered almond clusters!:)
<BR>
<P>Anyway, this list usually does not have much to offer given the high amount
<BR>
of pure wasted posts on it, but the gun debate makes it even worse.  I'd
<BR>
rather get back to discussing specifically Extropian topics...  AI, IA, life
<BR>
extension, uploading, uplifting, space colonization, nanotechnology, and the
<BR>
like.
<BR>
<P>I know I can out wait the debate -- and I also know it will be back again in
<BR>
a few months or years -- but wonder how many people lurking out there will
<BR>
just tune out.  I already know two or three who have over the past two years
<BR>
or so.  And those are people I know personally.  It's a great [being
<BR>
sarcastic] way to spread your memes, eh?  Rant and rave!  That always
<BR>
works!:(
