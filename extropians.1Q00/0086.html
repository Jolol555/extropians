<P><P><EM>&gt; Is there any actual historical evidence that JC even existed?

<P><P>The most obvious, or famous, evidence is the New Testament, totally apart
<BR>
from whether one considers the New Testament to have any religious
<BR>
validity.  Some (most?) of the books of the New Testament were allegedly
<BR>
written by Apostles of Christ who knew him personally during his life,
<BR>
and were written down in contemporary Greek within a couple of hundred
<BR>
years of the lifetime of Jesus, with, I think, a fairly good 'chain of
<BR>
custody' of copies and translations down to our time, including some
<BR>
extant manuscripts which can be dated to very early times. 
<BR>
Christianity's two 'sister' religions, Judaism and Islam, both recognize
<BR>
Jesus as a religiously significant figure, and therefore presumably also
<BR>
as historical fact.  The Jews consider Jesus to have been a Rabbi
<BR>
(religious teacher), and Islam lists Jesus as a prophet, one of many
<BR>
prophets who came before Mohammed, the Seal of the Prophets (the last
<BR>
prophet).
<BR>
<P><P>Dozens, if not hundreds, of towns and other sites mentioned in the New
<BR>
Testament are identifiable today, some with a high degree of confidence,
<BR>
with ruins and physical features which can be directly verified in person
<BR>
by a modern visitor.  Numerous artifacts of various types, including
<BR>
pottery and hundreds of thousands if not millions of coins from the
<BR>
general era of Jesus still exist and provide abundant evidence of the
<BR>
historical context in which rulers or governors held power in particular
<BR>
regions at particular times surrounding the places and times associated
<BR>
with Jesus.  
<BR>
<P><P>A much more recent figure, William Shakespeare, is the subject of
<BR>
controversy as to whether he actually wrote the famous plays of the
<BR>
1500s, despite the fact that he allegedly lived in a time when literacy
<BR>
was not uncommon, and he allegedly wrote and produced plays which were
<BR>
performed very publicly in London, the world's leading metropolis at the
<BR>
time, and everyone there spoke English, not much different from the
<BR>
English of today.  The plays were, I think, advertised with mass-produced
<BR>
printed handbills.  Like Jesus, Shakespeare became more famous after his
<BR>
time than during his time, and like Jesus, it seems that there will
<BR>
always be some who cannot be convinced of the historical validity of
<BR>
Shakespeare, just as there will always be some who doubt that men walked
<BR>
on the Moon in 1969.
<BR>
<P><P>Which of the following legendary figures actually existed: Davey
<BR>
Crockett, Paul Bunyan, Johnny Appleseed?
