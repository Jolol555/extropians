<EM>&gt; &lt;&lt; I would assign most of the responsibility
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to record companies, which are notorious for the tenacity and ferocity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  with which they pursue every conceivable claim against allies and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  competitors alike.  The lawyers are mere functionaries in the process. &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; The thing is, it really is a direct rip-off. I'd have sued too!
</EM><BR>
<P>It only seem to be a &quot;rip-off&quot; because you grew up in a culture where
<BR>
legislators _defined_ derivative art as &quot;theft&quot;.  They did such a good
<BR>
job of propagandizing this idea that it seems &quot;natural&quot; to most people
<BR>
who might be surprized to know how recent the idea is.  And those
<BR>
legislators were--guess who--lawyers, the consummate monopolists.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; But in today's song market it seems really strange to sue, because today's 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; music is so dirivative! And then using other musician's music even to the 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; point where we are actually USED to hearing stolen music.  We expect it! 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dubbing and using sound clips is normal now... yesterday my neighbor was 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sampling James Brown.. that's wrong... like sampling the beatles...
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But then I like Beck so I better shut up
</EM><BR>
<P>All art is derivative, and always has been.  Shakespeare never wrote
<BR>
a story in his life (he just reworded other people's stories).  All
<BR>
music comes from common scales and harmonies that have been part of
<BR>
the public domain for centuries.  Sampling is nothing but applying
<BR>
modern technologies to the age-old art of collage; if Rembrandt or
<BR>
Mozart had had computers, you can bet they'd have been doing it too.
