<P><EM>&gt; Oh yeah.  But for whatever reason Ocean Thermal is non-profitable, or 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  technically impractical. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I've been following it for years...to me (a non technical type)....it seems 
<BR>
feasable....but I imagine there is a lot of difference between being 
<BR>
technically feasible and economically feasible....
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;I just saw a presentation on CNN about the 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  algae/hydrogenase thing. I am still doubtful because CNN presented two 
</EM><BR>
other 
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  breakthroughs that I re-call. One was Nitinol, which also was supposed to 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  power civilization. 
</EM><BR>
<P>That's the 'memory metal&quot;?.....that always seem kind of a 'gimmick' to 
<BR>
me...but come to think of it...nitinol might have micro or nano 
<BR>
applications...
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;The other was Bogdan Maglich's Migma reactor concept. 
<BR>
<EM>&gt;  Both proved to be non-developable.
</EM><BR>
<P>I never heard of that...
<BR>
<P>You might recall however that the Laser was well known for years and years 
<BR>
prior to it's being used for much of anything.  I seem to recall that it was 
<BR>
refered to as
<BR>
&quot; the phenomena in search of an application&quot; or some such.  Today you'll 
<BR>
notice that lasers are everywhere....used in a multiple of applications.
<BR>
<P>But I agree with you about TV....it is after all....entertainment....
