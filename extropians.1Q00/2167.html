<EM>&gt; but if you do something in a foreign country that it legal there, but
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; illegal in the U.S., or in your home state, you can be prosecuted when
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; you get back, as in the U.S. companies that payed the expected foreign
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; backsheesh and then got prosecuted.
</EM><BR>
<P>As I recall, didn't this require the enactment of some special &quot;laws&quot;?
<BR>
Then the question becomes how far those laws extend.  For example
<BR>
are their any cases of U.S. citizens being prosecuted for smoking pot
<BR>
in Amsterdam or going to Australia to visit a &quot;legal&quot; prostitute?
<BR>
I doubt they can be prosecuted under state or city ordinances, it
<BR>
would seem that these laws would have to be at the federal level.
<BR>
<P>I believe in the cases you cite Phil, the obivious solution
<BR>
is to give up your U.S. citizenship before you get adventurous.
<BR>
Legally it would seem they would be on very swampy ground trying to
<BR>
prosecute the activities of non-citizen in foreign lands.
<BR>
It turns out to be remarkably easy to give up U.S. citizenship
<BR>
and get citizenship in other countries (with enough $$$).
<BR>
Then at that point, you simply need either a Green card or
<BR>
relationships with your &quot;employer&quot; such that they pay an offshore
<BR>
trust for any consulting you might do.
