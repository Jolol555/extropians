<P><EM>&gt; However, I still question why you would place nihilism and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; atheism closely together.
</EM><BR>
<P>First, Curt, again I apologize for the misplaced referent.
<BR>
<P>Second, perhaps we need to discuss what I'm trying to
<BR>
diagrammatically represent.  Think of it as similar to a
<BR>
square of opposition representing not logical relationships
<BR>
but relationships among belief-systems, dominant and
<BR>
recessive personality traits, and ideological group dynamics.
<BR>
Quite a bit for one diagram -- maybe TOO much.
<BR>
<P>Because of the way the dominance and recession of traits
<BR>
works both individually and collectively within our strange
<BR>
species, every Creed [&quot;credo&quot; - I believe] casts a shadow.
<BR>
In terms or psychodynamics, the cathexis of any trait must
<BR>
produce an anticathexis of its opposite -- in Freud, libido
<BR>
flows along a continuum between opposites, ultimately Eros
<BR>
and Thanatos, or in Jung psychic energy flows between the
<BR>
conscious and unconscious standpoints, which are likewise
<BR>
oppositional.  If the moderate alteration of the direction of
<BR>
flow of these energies is blocked, energy piles up at one
<BR>
limit (for example, the Persona inflates, the Shadow becomes
<BR>
dangerously depotentiated).  Repression in Freud exhibits
<BR>
the same feature -- to maintain the ego's social appearance,
<BR>
more and more effort (libido, energy) is required the maintain
<BR>
the repression of countervalent tendencies.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, an &quot;Old Maid&quot; is the woman who, every
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;night, looks under her bed to make sure the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thing she wants most isn't there.
<BR>
<P>Eventually a catastropic deflation of the Persona (or Ego-
<BR>
Ideal) is precipitated by something akin to psychological
<BR>
homeostasis to restore &quot;medan agans&quot; or &quot;via media&quot;. Now
<BR>
in relation to the diagram some implications are:
<BR>
<P>[1] If one ideology for any reason loses momentum due
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to &quot;hardening of the categories&quot;, the energy that
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;motivates its devotees will begin to flow in precisely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the opposite direction -- in the diagram that means
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the ideology located in the same position oppositely.
<BR>
<P>[2] From this you can see that the juxaposition of atheism
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and nihilism means they are related as different degrees
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of a similar tendency, but NOT by opposition. An atheist
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;whose emotional conviction is evaporating is most likely
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to become a humanist, or perhaps a skeptic or liberal,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but NOT a nihilist.  In my latest version, if the faith
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of an Orthodox Christian was only maintained by severe
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;repression, his/her conversion to Extropianism (if at all
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible) is the most probable result of such energic
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reversal.  Thus the counterculture of the sixties becomes
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the conservative establishment of the eighties. To save
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;space I'll let you work out other examples for yourself.
<BR>
<P>[3] Thus &quot;atheism&quot; and &quot;nihilism&quot; are related as points on a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;continuum -- a very different relationship.  The diagram
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;shows how an ideological tendency can pass through a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;series of stages, contiguous elements representing a
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;modification of each other but not a negation.  If, for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example, Atheism is a denial of the supernatural, then
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nihilism takes this much farther to a denial of the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;supernatural AND the natural (or secular). But nihilism
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not a conversion of atheism, but rather an significant
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;amplification or magnification of a common tendency.
