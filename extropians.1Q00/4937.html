<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; I will state however, that IMO, the gun manufacturers are being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; irresponsible in this day and age of technology, selling products
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; that are not engineered so that only the owner can turn them on.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; If you can protect a computer from misuse, you should be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; engineer weapons so that they cannot accidentally (or intentionally
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; in the wrong hands) harm people.  If you accept this premise, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; efforts by the gun manufacturers (or members of Congress) to try
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; and enact laws that can keep people from suing the gun manufacturers
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; are highly misguided.  [I might be willing to grandfather certain very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt; old weapons, but modern day products should be engineered to be safe.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; You can engineer computers to be protected from misuse by use of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; very circuitry the computer is made up of. To protect a gun from misuse,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; you will need to install a computer on the gun, that is small enough,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; power supply and all, to not impede the use of the gun. Current research
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; models are projected to add a minimum of $1000.00 to the cost of each
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; gun if put in production, which also decreases their reliability, as gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; recoil is NOT something that electronics are particularly good at
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; dealing with on a frequent basis, and compact power supplies are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; notoriously short lived. Additionally, such technology limits the gun's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use to the OWNER. Other family members or employees would not be able to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; use them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Sorry, Mike, but Robert wins this one.  The technology to make a gun with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a solid-state passive transponder totally immune to recoil and making the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; gun usable by anyone bearing the properly-coded transceiver (worn as a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wristband, ring, cuff link...) could be manufactured for far less than 1%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of the cost of the gun.  The NRA should be funding devlopment and gun
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; manufacturers should be advertising these things.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I give many thanks that the NRA is protecting my right to use the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; effective technologies of the day to take responsibility for my life;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it is inexcusable for them to hold back this technology.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is where you are totally wrong, Lee. Guns and computers just do not
<BR>
mix, for several reasons. Computers are the ultimate planned
<BR>
obsolescence object, they are not expected to function, for the most
<BR>
part, for more than a decade or so past the manufacture date, while most
<BR>
guns currently on the market are several decades old at least. One of my
<BR>
guns is 30 years old, and most of my father's guns average 40-50 years
<BR>
old, with the oldest being over 90 years old. We don't have any
<BR>
computers that have even operated for that length of time. The 'shock
<BR>
proof' technology you speak of is developed for military artillery
<BR>
ammunition, but is only built to withstand one such shock, not the
<BR>
thousands of shocks a gun will endure through its life. Additionally,
<BR>
your back of the email estimates of cost are based on your experience
<BR>
with computer production that deals with economies of scale in the tens
<BR>
of millions of units for each company. The entire gun industry
<BR>
manufactures less than 1.5 million guns a year, and you are not going to
<BR>
have one size fits all ID technology. The NRA is doing NOTHING to hold
<BR>
back this technology. However, the frivolous lawsuits that democrat
<BR>
decimated urban wastelands are bringing against manufacturers are
<BR>
causing some to adopt unwise smartgun polcies that mandate such
<BR>
technology for civilians, but exempt police from such technology
<BR>
requirements. The cities don't want to pay the cost of their own
<BR>
mandates. Considering that police firearms are most likely to kill
<BR>
innocent civilians of all guns, one would think they would apply this
<BR>
requirement to their own police forces.
