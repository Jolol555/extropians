<EM>&gt; What's more likely is that if Zyvex wants to sell more than one Anything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Box, their Boxes will be programmed to build only those objects which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; have been signed with by Zyvex's public RSA key; which, of course, will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; not include Anything Boxes.  Or submachine guns.
</EM><BR>
<P>Following up on the crypto angle, there's also a technology called
<BR>
&quot;group&quot; or &quot;threshold&quot; signatures, which requires a group of people
<BR>
(or some subset) to work together to create a signature.  Years ago I
<BR>
suggested the ultimate democracy, Anything Boxes which would only create
<BR>
objects which were signed by a threshold signature meaning that (say)
<BR>
80% of the human race approved that design.
<BR>
<P>I think Drexler first proposed the idea of the &quot;limited assembler&quot; back
<BR>
in Engines, something which would make consumer and industrial devices
<BR>
but wouldn't make super-dangerous things.  (Obviously even something as
<BR>
simple as a baseball bat can be used to club someone, unless it's a pretty
<BR>
damn smart bat.)  Along with that he proposed a centimeter-sized isolation
<BR>
lab where you could build anything you want, but it couldn't get out.  This
<BR>
is how new designs would be tested and approved.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (As modified to take into account the &quot;nanotech -&gt; quantum computing -&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; no more RSA&quot; chain.  Open (?) question:  Using quantum computing, is it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; possible to create a public-key encryption method immune to quantum decryption?)
</EM><BR>
<P>First of all I am skeptical that it will ever be practical to build
<BR>
quantum computers able to crack large RSA keys, because of environmental
<BR>
noise.
<BR>
<P>However if they do get built, there are some public key schemes which are
<BR>
not vulnerable to their attacks.  These are relatively obscure, involving
<BR>
coding theory or CAs, and haven't been examined very thoroughly.  They
<BR>
tend to have disadvantages of having very large keys and/or signatures.
<BR>
But if quantum computers destroy the factoring and discrete-log schemes
<BR>
that are widely used today, these other methods would hopefully be able
<BR>
to take over.
