<P><EM>&gt; Well, here we go again!  And they said a second world-war just would not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; happen! lol!  I do enjoy reading Mike Lorrey's posts though(there sure are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; enough of them! lol).  I do wonder when our resident power (Greg Burch) will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decide when to say, &quot;enough is enough!!&quot; ;)
</EM><BR>
<P>I've said my piece. I did dig up a few of Joe Dees' posts from the trash bin
<BR>
because it seemed for a minute that he was actually talking in a calm reasoned
<BR>
manner, and was making relatively cogent points.
<BR>
<P>As for the rest of the list, as I've said before, and this time I make it my
<BR>
pledge to the list: I will NOT initiate the gun debate on this list at any time.
<BR>
I will also extend myself and try to keep gun related analogies and metaphors
<BR>
out of other posts, however because I use guns so much and I am so comfortable
<BR>
with the technology and terminology, I can't guarrantee that as an absolute. If
<BR>
anyone else wishes to ask me about some gun related issue or for facts, I will
<BR>
respond to requests, and if someone else wants to debate the issue again, I will
<BR>
participate.  As I think I have shown in this past debate, I will not get into
<BR>
rude and outrageously insulting behavior, and will killfile anyone else who does
<BR>
do so in a gun debate.
<BR>
<P>Finally, for anyone on the list who may want to debate this issue, but do not
<BR>
want to be perceived as 'polluting' the list, then you are free to join the
<BR>
exi-freedom list I set up on eGroups. Go to <A HREF="http://www.eGroups.com">http://www.eGroups.com</A> and search
<BR>
for exi-freedom or extropians, and you will find our page. You can subscribe as
<BR>
a daily journal or to receive message by message. Both myself and Sasha
<BR>
Chislenko are the moderators for the list.  There were at last count, about
<BR>
20-22 members or so, and traffic is low to non-existent, since its mainly there
<BR>
as an emergency release valve for the main extropians list, as far as I am
<BR>
concerned. Both sides of the issue are welcome, but don't expect to get away
<BR>
with whining or shouting down pro-gunners as some people are wont to do.
