<EM>&gt;Dear friends-- Following on with my personal obsession right =ow, I'd
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;suggest funding for research in the linguistic and neural net bases of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;biological interactions, from the genome on up through brains and on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to ecosystems. Understanding and predicting how biological systems
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;=oordinate, communicate, and translate communications into physiology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and behavior =s going to be the biggest problem facing us in the life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sciences in the next century--and it's traditionally been an area of little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;interest and =ven considerable bias.
</EM><BR>
<P>Greg might like _Evolution as Entropy_ (2/e) by Brooks and Wiley.  They use
<BR>
some linguistics methods in their account of biological evolution.  See also
<BR>
Elisabeth Lloyd's _The Structure and Confirmation of Evolutionary Theory_,
<BR>
which uses semantic analysis of biological theories.  Different approaches,
<BR>
but similar in many ways, and similar to what Greg is getting at here, I
<BR>
believe.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Removing the bias (an effort which is =nderway, and proceeding very
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;slowly) and then funding research and conferences = on biological
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;language systems and cooperative interaction would go a long =ay
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;to pushing the science.
</EM><BR>
<P>Or, to be paranoid, create better ways for us to be marketed and PRed into
<BR>
following whomever is on top.:/  Sorry, must have been coopted by a Luddite
<BR>
meme for a second there.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;And frankly, we're not going to survive on Mars until we can
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;design a = low-energy, stable, and robust ecosystem that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;can support humans for years. We quite =imply do not have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the theoretical understanding necessary to design such a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;=ystem, and trial and error attempts (leading possibly to a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;multi-billion dollar =pace disaster) could push our planetary
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exploration program back by =ecades.
</EM><BR>
<P>I think the problem with this is why Mars?  Why escape one gravity well only
<BR>
to plunge into another one?  See below.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Biosphere 2 in its early, idealistic incarnation is a sobering
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;reminder =f how naive we still are!
</EM><BR>
<P>Ignorance is a constant companion, but part of the problem here is the
<BR>
notion that one should have a closed system at all.  Why not design simpler
<BR>
systems which could be replenished?  After we have a foothold in space, one
<BR>
could worry about designing some ideal construct of a life support system.
<BR>
I'd rather do that than wait until everyone feels confident about another
<BR>
biosphere.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Such research, of course,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;could be fed back immediately into everything =rom disease
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;control to environmental remediation to designing a world
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;=iological community that would comfortably support the twenty
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;billion or so people =e might expect by 2050, given longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and health = improvements that would also follow. To make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the next long leap, we have to understand much more about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;who we =re and how we function together and in nature,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;and how nature functions with =nd without us.
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, but again, understanding will always lag behind.  I'd rather not
<BR>
wait until all the problems are solved.  It wouldn't be as much fun.
<BR>
<P>'night!
