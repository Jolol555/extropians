<P><EM>&gt; This is fascinating.   You must understand that the technologies I deal with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  every day do not include cryogenics and nanotech.  When I participate in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  this list, I am not inclined to shop-talk, which means I take a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; philosophical
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  approach.  I'm afraid I'm painfully ignorant regarding precisely those 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; techno-
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  logies that are of greatest interest to Extropians. So would you be willing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  to talk about this some more?
</EM><BR>
My tack on this is not to get bogged down in semantics (or semiotics) but to 
<BR>
address the &quot;How&quot; questions that science\technology\rationality might 
<BR>
provide, or even &quot;God&quot; if you prefer. An example of &quot;How&quot; would be a magician 
<BR>
viewing how another magician performs a stage illusion.  The magician sitting 
<BR>
in the audience would have some keen insights into how the trick is achieved; 
<BR>
more so then I would.   Having said that, my focus is then applying that 
<BR>
principle to how would an afterlife be achieved?  The closest attempts at 
<BR>
this that I have encountered by bench scientists would we Hans Moravec at 
<BR>
Carnegie Mellon, Frank Tipler at Tulane, Max Tegmark at Penn State.  After 
<BR>
studying their research, it seems to be that what the field needs is other 
<BR>
proposals, other researchers, of which their appears to be a lack of.  
<BR>
<P>Briefly, Moravec in Mind Children (1988) suggests the computing power of a 
<BR>
neutron star be used to re-simulate all of earth's history down to this very 
<BR>
moment. Tipler believes that intelligent Life (robotic) will over-take the 
<BR>
Big Bang and collapse the cosmos into 2 physical dimensions; designed to 
<BR>
perpetuate and re-emulate the totality of life.  Tegmark, very popular on 
<BR>
this list, and the Everything List, proposes that an ensamble of universes, 
<BR>
some of which contain you and I. In some of these, there are or will be 
<BR>
versions of us that will transcend mortality by simply living billions of 
<BR>
years.
<BR>
<P>What seems to be missing from all three scholars is follow-through. There 
<BR>
doesn't seem to be any  fringe academia even to continue these hypothesis. I 
<BR>
believe that these ideas need refinement.
