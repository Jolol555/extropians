&nbsp;Would you believe -- cognitive dissonance is the mother of invention?
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;And how is dissonance resolved? Consider a hearty belch following an
<BR>
&nbsp;immense meal -- it is required as the method of choice for the expulsion
<BR>
&nbsp;of a painful accumulation of abdominal gas. Lacking this, one is transfixed
<BR>
&nbsp;in one's chair, and cannot proceed to the rec room for a nice game of
<BR>
&nbsp;pool.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;How's that? &gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>I understand that as one definition of *laughter*, yes. A burp or hiccup type 
<BR>
response to the neo cortex's expected rational thought paths being hijacked 
<BR>
by the less astute amagdala. Yes. But. Humor is entirely another and more 
<BR>
complex set of responses, and comes in many hues. 
<BR>
<P>Cognitive dissonance, on the other hand, is a much broader term as well! 
<BR>
<P>It has many ways of being felt besides laughter. Anxiety is one, for example, 
<BR>
that could &quot;get you up out of your chair&quot; should a problem occur. Can't we 
<BR>
just say anxiety is necessary for problem solving?
<BR>
<P>Even if one accepts the definition of a sense of humor as a simple matter of 
<BR>
cognitive dissonance expelling itself as gas (which I do not agree with, but 
<BR>
let's play with it) how does that reinforce your argument that it is a part 
<BR>
of problem solving?
<BR>
<P>Very literal and concrete as a child would be, 
<BR>
