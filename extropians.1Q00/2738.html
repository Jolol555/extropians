<EM>&gt;  Trouble is, how do you make a system that can cope appropriately with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  a group like, say, Aum Shinryko, membership in the tens of thousands, who
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  want to immanetize the eschaton (by building grey goo), without denying,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  say, smaller groups like, say, Alcor, membership somewhat smaller,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  who want to build their ressurect-o-mat(TM) (for all the corpsicles in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  their freezer)? &gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Instead of a majority vote, how about a majority veto?  A proposed design is 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sent out to everyone, and is approved after a length of time unless a 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; majority of people vote against it.  
</EM><BR>
<P>I like it but I don't think it'll work.
<BR>
<P>Points in favour: Torvald's law applies (&quot;given an infinite number of
<BR>
eyeballs, all bugs are shallow&quot;) to spotting hazards.
<BR>
<P>Points against:
<BR>
<P>* It's vulnerable to special interest groups trashing someone's project
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;for irrational reasons. (Consider the current mess over GM crops in the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;EU for an instance of this sort of thing.)
<BR>
<P>* It's vulnerable to an effective denial of service attack. If you want
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;to smuggle a bad design through, simply hit the approvals mechanism with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;about ten million spurious design requests, all generated by making
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;variations off some core structure. This will overload the people
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;monitoring the designs, leading to designs being passed by default without 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;enough people checking them. (You could work around this by making
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;submitting a design a chargable expense, like filing for a patent, but
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;then you end up saddling the nascent nanotech design industry with 
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;a very artificial cost structure and force legitimate inventors to
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;subsidize bull-goose loonies.)
<BR>
<P>* It's inimical to the currently understood concept of a patent -- in
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;effect, it gives your business competitors an opportunity to veto your
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;best inventions, rather than protecting them. I'm no fan of the current
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;patent system, but I think this is going rather too far in the opposite
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;direction!
<BR>
<P>I think with some careful thinking you can probably find ways to tackle
<BR>
these objections: some ultimate version of a &quot;distributed veto&quot; may well
<BR>
prove workable. But I think designing these safeguards safely is going
<BR>
to be rather a tricky problem ...
