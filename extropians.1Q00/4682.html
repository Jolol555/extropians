<EM>&gt; &gt;Wouldn't it be great if we could pass an international law that said
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;that nations had to fight their wars in simulators?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; While you're at it: how about a law that outlaws war?  How about all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; international disputes resolved by televised debate and online plebiscite?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; North Ireland's Catholic v. Protestant
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Israel v. Palestine
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Russia v. Chechnya
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all decided with the click of a mouse!
</EM><BR>
<P>The problem with issues that lead to war is that they are typically
<BR>
issues where the parties both have truly justified but conflicting
<BR>
interests, also where there is also an element where the situation has
<BR>
festered for so long that the original reasons are no longer the main
<BR>
reasons, only hate. In such situations, any plebiscite will not be
<BR>
rational, and losers will not willingly accept being outvoted.
<BR>
<P>The problem with voting on it is who is the plebiscite? I doubt the
<BR>
Catholics would want a majority of Protestants deciding their fate,
<BR>
thats the whole source of their problems as they see it.  The point of
<BR>
contests of champions, whether it be war, olympics, trade, etc. is that
<BR>
if you lose its entirely your own fault. Its not so hard to accept the
<BR>
dictates of others if you know that you have done absolutely everything
<BR>
for your own cause. If the victors are rather decent about winning (as
<BR>
the US/Allies was with Japan and Germany) then its not so bad, I would
<BR>
imagine. Besides that, by the time a conflict finishes, the losers are
<BR>
too mentally/emotionally exhausted anyways but to accept defeat.
<BR>
<P>Given the relative success of the campaign to ban landmines, I would
<BR>
expect that a Contest of Champions Treaty would likely be feasible in
<BR>
the not so distant future to determine intractable issues. Of course,
<BR>
you still have the problem of people being good sports if their side
<BR>
loses. Given the violence we've seen after some countries lose in the
<BR>
World Cup, I'm not sure this is to be automatically expected...
<BR>
<P>However, if you set the system up where any person in the conflicting
<BR>
groups can volunteer to compete in the simulation, as many times as they
<BR>
wish, and the simulation is sufficiently physically and mentally
<BR>
demanding to tax the limits of the individual, you could potentially
<BR>
attain a similar level of emotional expenditure. After a given time
<BR>
period, say of three or five years or so, the side with the most wins
<BR>
wins the issue. By this time, all the hot heads will have shot their
<BR>
wads, win or lose.
