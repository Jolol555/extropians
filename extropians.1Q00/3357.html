Well, in my case I think that uploading will happen gradually,the more 
<BR>
the technology advances, the nearer we'll get
<BR>
to our goal, that in this case is to leave completely the physical 
<BR>
body temporarily or not, I suppose that first, we'll see some pretty 
<BR>
advanced VR,that will be generated thanks to the advances in computer 
<BR>
graphics, and they'll be maintained by people from several disciplines 
<BR>
ranging from artist and scientists, I suppose that maybe quasi 
<BR>
sentient or primitively sentient AI's will help in the generation and 
<BR>
mainteinance of computer generated worlds, the first will be very 
<BR>
limited tho, but then I suppose they'll start getting more complex, 
<BR>
and realistic although with realistic I mean that they'll feel more 
<BR>
like interacting in the physical world, but I think that our virtual 
<BR>
worlds will be all what we didn't have in our real one, and it'll 
<BR>
remove several limitations we have now. So considering all this I 
<BR>
suppose the uploading experience (specially on a mature system 
<BR>
prepared specially for this purpose) could be traumatic for the big 
<BR>
majory, however after the initial unpleasant sensations are felt and 
<BR>
we start getting more accustomed to the new places the majory of 
<BR>
people is going to like them, while I don't discard the possibility of 
<BR>
some people still complaining about this change, in a pretty similar 
<BR>
fashion to the recent GM FOODS oposition.
<BR>
<P>So how a digital world would be? I suppose it'll be divided into 
<BR>
diferent areas all with their own rules, customs and decoration, maybe 
<BR>
some will have music that suits the people that lives or visits those, 
<BR>
I also suppose that people will be able to create their own worlds and 
<BR>
invite their friends just like we do in irc or other similar pgorams, 
<BR>
I also suppose that being a collection of digital information, the 
<BR>
information exchange between one person and other will be 
<BR>
unprecedented, people will be better understood and we'll be able to 
<BR>
communicate in unthinkable ways, it'll be interesting to see the 
<BR>
amount of social change this will bring, I suppose that things like 
<BR>
telepathy, omniscience and omnipresence will be possible, with the 
<BR>
choice to turn on or off these abilities depending on the degree of 
<BR>
communication you want at a particular time, I wonder however if 
<BR>
there'll be a technology so the uploading process can be reversed so 
<BR>
we end in clones of our original bodies enchanced of course, or so we 
<BR>
could place our conscience in other hosts,maybe we'll enjoy our 
<BR>
virtual worlds so much nobody would want to leave. I can't even 
<BR>
imagine what will happen when all this gets combined with the 
<BR>
posibilities of mature nanotech.
<BR>
<P>Well that's just my vision, any comments?
