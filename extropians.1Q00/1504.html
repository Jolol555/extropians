<EM>&gt; A large percentage of the people on this list are software developers.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I suspect there are several hundred years experience in the field (I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; account for about 20 of them).  Does anyone here really think that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investment in software companies is due to software patents?  I doubt
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it strongly.  Software patents are sand in the gears of progress, not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; grease.  I think even supporters or agnostics to the idea would agree
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that they played little or no positive role in the industry.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't think that investment in software companies is &quot;due to&quot; software
<BR>
patents, exclusively.  But it is can be an important consideration
<BR>
for investors.  A company with a strong intellectual property position
<BR>
generally has an easier time attracting investors than one whose designs
<BR>
can be freely copied.  Companies usually do play up their IP protection
<BR>
possibilities in their investment literature.
<BR>
<P>I got a TiVo for Christmas, and I've been thinking of investing in the
<BR>
company.  Reading the investment boards, patent protection or its absence
<BR>
is something that comes up fairly often.  TiVo claims to have patents
<BR>
pending, but are they significant?  Or will Microsoft be able to waltz
<BR>
in and put out an identical product?  It makes a big difference in the
<BR>
company's future prospects, which is what drives the investment decision.
<BR>
<P>Today it is even becoming possible to get patents on the business
<BR>
model, as &quot;name your own price&quot; priceline.com has done.  If you go to
<BR>
priceline.com and click on &quot;Investor Relations&quot; at the bottom, the very
<BR>
first sentence of their investor relations page says &quot;Priceline.com is
<BR>
the patented Internet pricing system that enables consumers to achieve
<BR>
significant savings by naming their own price for goods and services.&quot;
<BR>
Priceline wouldn't mention patents in the one sentence that prospective
<BR>
investors are most likely to read, unless they thought it would be
<BR>
important to investors.
