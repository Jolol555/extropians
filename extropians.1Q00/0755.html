<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;you criticize by saying that the people/literature you reference 
</EM><BR>
shows that ''justificationalism'' is wrong and (more or less) outdated...&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>It is old and not currently is vogue due to such concepts as Dawkin's 
<BR>
Universal Darwinism -- a unification of the philosophy of biology with the 
<BR>
whole of philosophy (see Popper and Eccles 1977 book _The Self and Its 
<BR>
Brain_,  Campbell, 1974 Evolutionary Epistemology_, Blackmore, Susan. 1999. 
<BR>
_The Meme Machine_.  Dennette, Danniel. 1995 _Darwin's Dangerous Idea_. )
<BR>
<P>&lt;Popper has said that one should do science by ''criticizing'' instead of  
<BR>
''justifying'' theories.&gt;
<BR>
<P>He said justification was impossible (due to Hume's Problem of Induction) 
<BR>
that sounds pessimistic BUT WAIT . . .  THAT MEANS justification is not 
<BR>
needed to get helpful theories!  That _is_ Dynamically Optimistic!  Look at 
<BR>
Martin Seligman's book _Learned Optimism_ . . . it fits right in: &quot;Control 
<BR>
what you can and forget the rest.&quot;
<BR>
<P>We have no need to empirically prove, justify, or verify (you can't do it 
<BR>
anyway, so forget it), but empirical tests (controlled experiments) that weed 
<BR>
out the errors and therefore find the surviving and helpful theories _are_ 
<BR>
worthwhile.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Now, I think that it is too easy to be misled by words into reading more 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; into  those Popper statements than he probably meant there.&gt;&gt;
</EM><BR>
<P>Popper is known as _THE_ main non-justificationalist opposed to A.J.Ayer's 
<BR>
(et. al.) justificationalism.  I do not understand how you could have missed 
<BR>
that.  Popper was never actually a member of the Vienna Circle who's members 
<BR>
supported verifiability with logical positivism (they called it logical 
<BR>
empiricism) and analytic philosophy.  
<BR>
<P>Popper, Bartley and Campbell are correctly the starting point for 
<BR>
evolutionary epistemology -- non-justificationalist epistemology.  To me it 
<BR>
is a relief we do not need proof --  that is ultimately Dynamically 
<BR>
Opitmistic.  
<BR>
<P>Look at page 37 and then pages 52 and 53 in Popper's _The Logic of Scientific 
<BR>
Discovery_, 1959 to see how he emphasized time and time again that his view 
<BR>
was NOT simply a substitution for verifiability leading to a requirement of 
<BR>
justified truth.  This was his way of demarcating science from pseudoscience 
<BR>
(see _Unended Quest_, 1986, 41).  He said his theory is a _replacement_ for 
<BR>
confirmation (proof) in his 1959, 108-9.  Only once in his _Conjectures and 
<BR>
Refutations_ (1963, 248 , n. 31) did he introduce an idea where he wanted in 
<BR>
his words &quot;a whiff of verificationalism.&quot;
