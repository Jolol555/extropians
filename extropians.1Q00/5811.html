wrote:&gt; &gt;1. This isn't an either-or proposition.  Both &quot;normal&quot; medical care
<BR>
and
<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;longevity can both be financed.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I realize that.  I was responding to Natasha who emphasized the need to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; counter the ubiquitous &quot;deathist&quot; meme.  My point was simply that it will
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt; much easier to get people to support longevity research once it is clear
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the environment will be able to support 10 billion people who like to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; make babies but don't like to die.
</EM><BR>
<P>Outside of advanced nations, I'm not sure that many people care about the
<BR>
environment.  I'm not saying this is a good thing, but it seems a peculiarly
<BR>
First World concern.  Yeah, sure, you can find well off people in the Third
<BR>
World worrying about such things, BUT I bet the average person in those
<BR>
societies does not care about it.
<BR>
<P>Now, this might support Zero here, since First Worlders might not want even
<BR>
more Third Worlders who are only interested in becoming First Worlders
<BR>
quickly and leaving the environment as a luxury for the future.
<BR>
<P>But however that might be, the truth is the US generates enough food now to
<BR>
feed about 5 times its population.  If the relation were strictly linear,
<BR>
then all we would need to feed a world of 10 billion people is the farmland
<BR>
of 8 USAs using current methods.  (Remember: most of the US is not farmed
<BR>
and not all farmland actually produces.  Actual stats are available at
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/census97/volume1/us-51/toc97.htm">http://www.nass.usda.gov/census/census97/volume1/us-51/toc97.htm</A>, but I'm
<BR>
too tired to look them up tonight.:/)  My point being, we don't need a lot
<BR>
of research and money to figure out what works.  We don't even that much to
<BR>
put it into practice.  In fact, probably the simplest way to do so would be
<BR>
to cut off foreign aid packages to all nations, especially Third World ones.
<BR>
This would, at the very least, stop funding local elites that typically put
<BR>
ineffective social and economic policies into play, often for their benefit
<BR>
at their peoples' expense -- not to mention it helps to prop up unpopular
<BR>
and tyrannical regimes.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It is hard to convince people that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; indefinite life spans won't presently sap our environmental and
</EM><BR>
agricultural
<BR>
<EM>&gt; resources when people now typically only live less than 80 years and yet a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; good percentage of us are living in poverty and starving.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree there will be a problem convincing the average person in the First
<BR>
World, but you don't need to do so.  All one has to do is get longevity
<BR>
research on a firmer footing and screw what the man or woman in the street
<BR>
thinks.  Get it done, then enough people will be around to solve these
<BR>
problems.  Notably, corpses don't tend to do a lot of creative/productive
<BR>
work -- at least, last time I checked.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;2. The amount of money needed to make decent progress towards longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;- to take the level you quoted, $100 million - would have very little
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;practical impact on supplying &quot;normal&quot; medical care.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I question whether $100 million would have very much impact on longevity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research.  My guess is that there is currently at least that much being
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; spent right now on aging research and other research that will be of value
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to life extensionists.  And sure $100 million would not end hunger, but
</EM><BR>
you
<BR>
<EM>&gt; could damn sure build a lot of irrigation with it.
</EM><BR>
<P>I doubt that much is being spent on longevity research -- not when cryonics
<BR>
organizations can hardly fund thier research, not when there exist only a
<BR>
handful of reputable clinics and foundations working on chemical life
<BR>
extension.  Perhaps some of the big drug companies are investigating this
<BR>
stuff, but I see most of the real work being done by universities and very
<BR>
limited in scope.  (Doug!  Prove me wrong!  Please prove me wrong!  I don't
<BR>
want to be right here.:)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Perhaps, but I still maintain that if you couch it in terms like
</EM><BR>
immortality
<BR>
<EM>&gt; or indefinite life span research, you are simply not going to make any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; headway with the public, at least until we have global poverty, ignorance
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and hunger already under control.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with Zero here.  I usually don't talk to people about immortality.
<BR>
Instead, I talk about living a very long time and staying young, active,
<BR>
happy, healthy for that time.  That usually digs into them more.  Some of
<BR>
this stuff has to be spoon fed, especially if you want to make a lasting
<BR>
impact.  For every person who buys into the immortality arguments, I've met
<BR>
about twenty who think it's akin to flying saucers and black helicopters.
<BR>
But when asked about just living longer and better, I'd say more than half
<BR>
the people I talk with are willing to listen and think about it.
<BR>
<P>This might be a sad commentary on human nature, but then think about if
<BR>
someone introduced you to a radically different way of looking at the world.
<BR>
If she was wearing a clown suit and walking on her hands and she also
<BR>
started talking about fantasy novels, would you really listen with rapt
<BR>
attention?  Or would you dismiss her as a kook?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Oh sure, that's likely to go over *really* well.  &quot;Hey, lets all fund a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; bunch of way-out research so Bill Gates can live forever, while millions
</EM><BR>
of
<BR>
<EM>&gt; kids in the third world (not to mention a few thousand right in the good
</EM><BR>
old
<BR>
<EM>&gt; US of A) go to bed hungry every night.&quot;  Nobody's going to touch that with
</EM><BR>
a
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 10 foot pole.  Not Republicans, not Democrats, nobody.
</EM><BR>
<P>It's not a matter of choice here.  The rich can afford the latest and
<BR>
greatest.  The poor can't.  Though I think more people today who aren't rich
<BR>
can get in on the ground floor, the fact that there's inequality is just a
<BR>
fact.  We have to deal with it for now.  Solving this problem -- one which
<BR>
was attempted to be solved during 70 years of Soviet history; see the
<BR>
results? -- is likely to be around much longer than we are, especially if we
<BR>
don't solve the longevity problem.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Don't get me wrong.  I wish there was a bunch more research being done on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; nano, cryo and immortality.  But the only way to get funding for such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; research is to convince people that there money is better spent there than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; somewhere else.  I just think we're going to have a heck of a time
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; convincing people of that as long as there are things to spend money on
</EM><BR>
like
<BR>
<EM>&gt; feeding, healing and improving the standard of living of the 6 billion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people we already share this planet with.
</EM><BR>
<P>Here I disagree with Zero.  I don't the problem exists as he states it.
<BR>
Most people do not spend that way.  They don't think, &quot;I've got to spend
<BR>
everything I have above bare necessity on help the Joneses have as much as I
<BR>
do.&quot;  These Establishment Liberal pieties sound good in campaign speeches or
<BR>
church sermons (for some, not for me), but most people never put them into
<BR>
practice (and it's probably a good thing they don't; what money is sent to
<BR>
help other societies often does more harm than good and a lot of it gets
<BR>
consumed by do nothing bureaucrats*).
