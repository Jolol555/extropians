<BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; I said it before I'll say
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  it again, medical ethicists are the lowest form of human life.

<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree -- especially since my profession is all too often relegated to that 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; position...
</EM><BR>
<P>As much as I dislike Greg's profession, I did learn lawyers are both
<BR>
necessary and useful during my last corporate adventure.  Lawyers
<BR>
are the &quot;microcoders&quot; of human intent.  The reason lawyers are
<BR>
held in disregard is that few humans recognize the degree to which
<BR>
what they say, may not be what they mean.  In contrast, the few
<BR>
individuals capable of designing computer microcode know very exactly
<BR>
how to say what they mean (if they are any good at it...).
<BR>
<P>[For the non computer literate, computer microcode are the actual
<BR>
&quot;bit patterns&quot; in modern computers that allow them to execute
<BR>
anything more complex than the simplest instructions.  For example
<BR>
most computers use microcode to execute &quot;divide&quot; instructions,
<BR>
which if you think about how you learned it in school is actually
<BR>
a rather complex operation.]
<BR>
<P>Now, the difference between lawyers and medical ethicists is that
<BR>
the lawyers accept precedent, even when they may think it
<BR>
is incorrect.  [If they really think it is incorrect, they may
<BR>
attempt to overturn it.]  Medical ethicists, in contrast,
<BR>
seem to either seem to either (a) think precedent should
<BR>
never be overturned (&quot;Everyone must die, I tell you, because
<BR>
everyone has always died...&quot;); or (b) define precedents
<BR>
to suit their agendas (right-to-life, etc.).  The problem
<BR>
with most medical ethicists is that they are effectively
<BR>
self-appointed, rather than &quot;elected&quot; as most judges are.
