<EM>&gt;            Long-Term Growth As A Sequence of Exponential Modes
</EM><BR>
<P>Very interesting paper!  A few comments and nitpicks:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Economic historians have put a lot of work into estimating world product
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; over the last century, while demographers and historians have worked to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; estimate world population over the last ten thousand years.
</EM><BR>
<P>I had trouble parsing this sentence.  In the first part, it wasn't clear
<BR>
whether &quot;over the last century&quot; referred to when the work was done,
<BR>
or the period for which the estimates were prepared.  It was only upon
<BR>
more thought that I decided that it was unlikely that anyone would claim
<BR>
that demographers and historians had been active for ten thousand years,
<BR>
so the &quot;over the&quot; clauses both referred to the period being studied.
<BR>
<P>I was surprised by the implication that not much work has been done on
<BR>
estimating world product for the period prior to the twentieth century.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; I list the number of doubles in the doubling time between terms
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [...]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Doubling   Date Began    Doubles  Doubles  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Time (DT)  To Dominate    of DT    of WP  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ----------  ------------  ------   -------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   515K yrs  &lt;1000K B.C.     ?       &gt;0.5
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    13K yrs    615K B.C.    1.9       4.7  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    860 yrs    4760 B.C.    7.3       7.4  
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     58 yrs    1732         3.9       3.2
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;     15 yrs    1903         1.9      &gt;6.3
</EM><BR>
<P>This &quot;Doubles of DT&quot; also took me a few minutes to figure out.  It is
<BR>
the log base 2 of the ratio of the doubling time in the row and the
<BR>
one above it.  So it is how many times the previous DT would have to be
<BR>
doubled to get to the current DT.  I'm not sure what would be a better
<BR>
way to explain it, but the wording is confusing, doubles of doubles.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; To examine the sensitivity of this model, we can compare results using
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; an another of De Long's time series, this one without his &quot;somewhat
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arbitrary&quot; factor of four to account for the extra improvements in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; product quality since 1800.
</EM><BR>
<P>Not being familiar with De Long's work, I was alarmed to learn that he
<BR>
had included a factor like this in his estimates.  Product quality is
<BR>
awfully subjective.  It makes me wonder how meaningful it is to even try
<BR>
to estimate total world product over a period of centuries and millennia.
<BR>
<P>Using the CES model, which considers interactions between the &quot;new&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;old&quot; economies, the fit is:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;  Doubling   Date Began    Doubles  Doubles  Transition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  Time (DT)  To Dominate    of DT    of WP     Power
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; ----------  ------------  ------   -------  ----------
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  1367K yrs  &lt;1000K B.C.     ?         &gt;0      ?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;   130K yrs    691K B.C.    3.4       5.3      1 (fixed)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    908 yrs    4904 B.C.    7.2       7.6      2.4
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;    6.3 yrs    2019         7.2      &gt;9.2      0.094
</EM><BR>
<P>I was puzzled by 2019 as the date the most recent technology &quot;began&quot;
<BR>
to dominate, and at first I thought it must be a typo.  Later on it is
<BR>
explained that technically, by this model, the &quot;old&quot; economy, based on
<BR>
agriculture, is still larger than the &quot;new&quot; economy, based on industry.
<BR>
Not until 2019 will the new economy grow larger than the old economy.
<BR>
<P>Is this consistent with economic data?  Is the total GWP today from
<BR>
agriculture still greater than that from industry?  We are always being
<BR>
told that farmers make up only a tiny percentage of the US population now.
<BR>
Granted, in much of the world farming is a dominant activity, but I would
<BR>
have thought that the total industrial output of the Western countries
<BR>
would be larger than worldwide agriculture.
<BR>
<P>It also seems questionable whether the industrial revolution can sustain
<BR>
a doubling rate of 6.3 years.  The figures from the other model of 58
<BR>
or 15 years seem more reasonable.  Wouldn't we expect something like
<BR>
the DJIA to model the growth rate of industry over much of this century?
<BR>
I think it had a doubling time of more like 15-20 years, until this past
<BR>
decade anyway.
<BR>
<P>Also, how do you figure 9.2 doubles of WP for the industrial term?
<BR>
You say that this is the number of doubles &quot;during a term's period&quot;,
<BR>
but when did the period for the industrial term start?  I thought you
<BR>
would start from 2019.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Figure 2 and Figure 3 show how a new transition might look, if it had the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fantastic doubling time of two weeks, had the same stong complementarity
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with our current economy that industry had with farming, and if it first
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; started to have a noticable effect on growth rates in 2041 (increasing
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the growth rate that year by 30% over its previous rate, but only 2%
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; in the previous year). Transitions starting at any other time would look
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; very similar. By 2046, i.e., within five years of becoming noticeable,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the economy would grow by larger factor than it had from one million
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; B.C. to 2040.
</EM><BR>
<P>These are amazing graphs, but there are some confusing aspects.  I can't
<BR>
seem to figure out why, qualitatively, the &quot;next&quot; transition looks
<BR>
so different in figure 2 from the previous ones.  For all the other
<BR>
transitions we see leveling, then a bump, then more leveling.  For the
<BR>
next transition we just see it take off straight up.  Why is it that the
<BR>
earlier transitions looked like they leveled off but this one doesn't?
<BR>
<P>For figure 3, it appears to show that this two-week doubling transition
<BR>
will lead to an annual growth rate of about 8.  But in fact it should
<BR>
be something like sixty million?  Is this chart showing the log of the
<BR>
annual growth rate, or the actual growth rate itself?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The data I've used are questionable, the model vastly oversimplified, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the predictions perhaps too fantastic to believe. But if anything like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these predictions are plausible, it seems a subject well worth further
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; investigation. This small note will hopefully be but the earliest of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; first efforts on this important topic.
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, this is truly amazing to consider.  A good example of how stepping
<BR>
back and taking the long view gives you a new perspective.  The transition
<BR>
we are going through today is just one of many, historically, and there
<BR>
is no reason to expect them to stop.  We tend to fall into the trap of
<BR>
assuming that tomorrow will be like today, when the better assumption
<BR>
is that the changes we will see tomorrow can be understood by looking
<BR>
at the changes which have occured in the past.
