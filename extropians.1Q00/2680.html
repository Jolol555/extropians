<BR>
It's clear to me--dare I say obvious--that if the Dr. Jekyll created this 
<BR>
personality duality so that the crimes could be committed without &quot;his&quot; 
<BR>
knowledge, then he is the leading agent in a criminal conspiracy, and 
<BR>
deserves the lion's share of the blame. Creating the means to escape 
<BR>
responsibility for your crimes is just an additional crime. Nail the 
<BR>
sumbitch.

<P>I see Jeff Davis working in the frontiers of human space as a hangin' 
<BR>
judge!!  &quot;It is the decision of this court that neuronano will make a copy 
<BR>
of your &quot;innocent&quot; personality which will be uploaded into a clone body, 
<BR>
then you will get your butt kicked out of an airlock and don't count on 
<BR>
being given a suit!&quot;  &quot;No deceptive neurohacker is going to make a mockery 
<BR>
of this court!&quot;  After closing the door of his office, he dances his little 
<BR>
dance of self-adulation. :)
<BR>
<P>Then afterward, Judge Davis who is the spitting image of Tom Selleck, goes 
<BR>
to the beach and lives the life of Riley.  Later, he briefly rules the 
<BR>
universe as a timesharing jupiter brain.
<BR>
<P><P>best regards,
<BR>
<P>John Grigg :)
