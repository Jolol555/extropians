<P>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the sociobiologist's move to make ethics a science ... The problem with it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;is ... no empirical facts by themselves can establish that an action is right.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I responded:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;[In principle, science] could find out everything that Dan Fabulich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would ever think about ethics under any circumstances.  And isn't that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;the closest Dan Fabulich could ever get to knowing what is ethical? Sure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;there might be some things about right and wrong that Dan Fabulich
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;could never know.  But no other approach to ethics could possibly reveal
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;more to Dan Fabulich than this.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Dan replied:
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;True enough, but we'll never HAVE a magic wand like this. The prediction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would surely affect my way of thinking about ethics, so the prediction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;would have to not only model my thoughts on the matter but its own effects
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;on my thoughts on the matter.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; [The conversation continued for two more posts, but let me return to here.]
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; It seems you have granted that your first statement was wrong.  Everything
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; we can know about ethics *is* in principle learnable via science.  You
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might claim that progress in this science will be terribly slow, or that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it will stop at some fundamental limit to scientific progress.  But I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; dispute this skepticism if it is mainly based on the possibility that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people will react to learning the theories that describe them.  This is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the standard situation in cognitive and social sciences, and yet these
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; sciences are making great progress.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, I haven't contradicted myself.  The hypothetical you offered me was
<BR>
that, through some scientific process, we might predict what I would think
<BR>
about ethics at the end of inquiry.  Surely, then, I can't know more about
<BR>
ethics than I would know at the end of inquiry, so, you argue, everything
<BR>
I can know about ethics is an empirical matter.
<BR>
<P>However, if no scientific process can DO that, then everything I know
<BR>
about ethics is NOT an empirical matter, since we can't actually run the
<BR>
experiment.  So if you agree with me that we'll never have a process like
<BR>
this, then you'll be forced to agree with me that ethics cannot be done
<BR>
purely empirically.
<BR>
<P>I countered with TWO objections, the main one being the first, that, a
<BR>
priori, a prediction like that is impossible.  (I'd primarily hinted at
<BR>
this argument, since you seemed to agree with me that it couldn't be
<BR>
done.) To predict what I would think about ethics at the end of inquiry,
<BR>
the process would have to predict what I would come to believe on the
<BR>
basis of the answer that it would give me; in other words, it would have
<BR>
to predict the result of its own computation.  A priori, this can't
<BR>
happen.
<BR>
<P>This problem is compounded if there IS no end of inquiry: if I live
<BR>
forever, make it to an Omega point, etc.  And, finally, it may run up
<BR>
against thermodynamic information limits on top of these difficulties.
<BR>
<P>In short, it can't ever happen, not even in principle.
<BR>
<P>And, unfortunately, getting close just doesn't cut it in this case, as it
<BR>
might in sociology, economics, or general psychology.  Knowing a little
<BR>
about human interaction is useful, but I already know A LITTLE about what
<BR>
I think about ethics (and what I'm going to think).  Knowing somewhat
<BR>
more, while potentially helpful, still won't render ethics a purely
<BR>
empirical matter unless it can tell me EVERYTHING I'll think about ethics,
<BR>
which it can't, thanks to the problems I describe above.
