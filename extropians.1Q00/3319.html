<EM>&gt; If we assume that the resulting being is incomprehensibly different
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; from what you are today, then what is the point?  Why not just kill
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; yourself?  What is it that you hope to preserve or gain by going through
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; a transformation more thorough than death?
</EM><BR>
<P>&lt;&gt;&gt;
<BR>
<P>No no no!! Again:
<BR>
*totally missing the point*. Not caring or wanting to know who you will be 
<BR>
and trusting AI's to make you that way seems dopey. This is not an answer, 
<BR>
it's a cop out. Only someone who is so young they feel immortal , or someone 
<BR>
who doesnt care much for life as it exists now. I asked for those who have a 
<BR>
vision &amp;*do* expect to survive as themselves, what the experience will be 
<BR>
like, so, unlike E here, the architects of that reality (transhumanists 
<BR>
pushing the edge) may have some hand in it...
