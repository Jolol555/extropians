<EM>&gt; Alternatively, and this is perhaps more interesting, if stresses like
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; these are what it takes to get complex life, then the fire &amp; ice
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; planets that have highly eliptical orbits, might evolve complex, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; even intelligent life, much quicker than did the Earth.  That would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imply that the &quot;Rare Earth&quot; arguments are pretty irrelevant.  (But
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; since the authors aren't biologists they may not discuss it [I've
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only gotten through the first couple of chapters so far].)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I would think the strategies of hibernation, low-temperature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; antifreeze proteins, etc. combined with DNA preservation strategies
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; found in Deinococcus radiodurans would allow the evolution of species
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that can tolerate the highly eliptical orbits.  So complex life
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; might be quite abundant.  Those that do get a leg up in such
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; environments are going to be hyper-evolving species compared
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with the rather pokey rates found on Earth.
</EM><BR>
<P>I don't doubt that complex organisms capable of surviving such environments
<BR>
are possible, but I have some reservations about the idea that they could
<BR>
evolve locally. Before you can have organisms with lots of elaborate
<BR>
adaptations for surviving extreme environmental swings, you have to have
<BR>
simple organisms that don't have such adaptations.  You need an environment
<BR>
in which life can arise, solve the basic survival problems like energy
<BR>
production and reproduction, and reach a level of complexity that allows
<BR>
complex adaptations to evolve.  That implies that a world that has a stable
<BR>
period followed by wild climate swings may support interesting life, but one
<BR>
that has always had extreme shifts may not evolve life in the first place.
<BR>
<P>Which leads me to what I found interesting about this whole theory.  IMO it
<BR>
should be rather unusual (to put it mildly) for a planet to undergo the
<BR>
kinds of shifts the authors are talking about without completely wiping out
<BR>
all life.  You need a combination of surface gravity, water abundance, solar
<BR>
energy levels and geography that falls within very narrow limits to get the
<BR>
kind of behavior they describe.  Disturb any one parameter by very much and
<BR>
you either can't get large climate shifts, can't recover from one, or don't
<BR>
have any enclaves where complex life can survive from one warm era to the
<BR>
next.
<BR>
<P>Which, of course, would have interesting implications for the expected
<BR>
abundance of sentient life in the universe.
