<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Right, that is *not* imperialism.  Imperialism is extending a nation's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; authority by territorial acquisition or by the establishment of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; economic and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; political hegemony over other nations.  The US is not doing this.  We
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; are
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; basically acting as the referee in the world's international wrestling
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; matches, and enforcing the rules when we notice low blows.  No, no one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; appointed us as the referee, but we're the biggest kid on the block
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; assumed the role of shot caller by default.  Maybe its a good thing,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; maybe
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; its not.  But it is definitely *not* imperialism.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; -Zero
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I sincerely wish the U.S., was doing what you say, but unfortunately
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the U.S. is still a very imperialist and interventionist country.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However please note, That this is because of the way the government
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; handles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; international issues and I'm sure more Americans oppose to imperialism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and most
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; most of it's current foreign policies, than those who advocate them.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But unfortunately when you live in America, you don't get all the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; information
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about the things that happen in our regions of the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Speaking of my country (Mexico)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Although after the end of the usa/Mexico war when we lost more than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; half our
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; territory the usa has never invaded or threatened us militarily,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they've forced
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us to do what they think it's better using all sorts of resources or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; excuses.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; An example of this is the certification measure, here in Mexico every
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; time the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; congress up there is deciding if we'll get or not certified. it
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; creates a lot of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tension and hurts our relations because it's an unilateral procedure
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; based on
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; U.S. Interests only and not ours, but they still implement it, because
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; easier to use scape goats and pretend they are combating drug abuse by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; being tough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on poor defenseless countries instead of looking wiser alternatives to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; this senseless
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; drug war, and I could quote several other examples (operation
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; casablanca, etc.)
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that the U.S. government does to force us their beliefs or systems.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And well to avoid unnecessary rants, I'll just say is not very fair
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; for a country to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; use it's enormous military or economic power to force other countries
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; do things they
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't like, and that in my opinion is... imperialism, call it neo
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; imperialism if you want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; but it still doesn't make it any less worse.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A lot of people in this world go to jail or suffer unnecesarily, just
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; because the American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; government in their big brother approach. Think people, aren't mature
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; and rational enough
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; to know what they should and shouldn't use or do with their lifes, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that everybody
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; needs to be protected against the &quot;dangers&quot; of drugs/communism/insert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your favorite excuse here.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; However don't get the wrong message here, I know there are governments
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; who are or would be a lot worse
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if they could, and that our corrupt government has as much fault as
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the usa in all this, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'm 99% certain that if our government (knowing their habits) had the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; power of the U.S. Would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be a lot worse... However, that is no excuse to overlook what the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; American government likes to do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; with other countries (or their own people sometimes) in the name of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; justice and peace.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; But being a bit more positive I think that with the arrival of the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Internet, globalization and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; meme generators like this list, we'll see the end of imperialism as we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; know it.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Any comments?
</EM><BR>
<P>Many comments, Octavio. I would prefer to see what others have
<BR>
say before respond.
<BR>
<P>But you have said precisely what everyone abroad who has
<BR>
actually EXPERIENCED the effect of Corporate Imperialism
<BR>
[we euphemistically refer to it the was you did, as &quot;American
<BR>
Interests&quot; a P.R. triumph for corporate America] will say if
<BR>
they feel they can speak candidly.
<BR>
<P>Your post is precisely what is MOST needed for the education
<BR>
of naive American public opinion.
<BR>
<P>May I congratulate you for your honesty?
<BR>
<P>Best wishes,
<BR>
