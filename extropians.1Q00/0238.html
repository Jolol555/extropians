<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Tolerance of many things some people do not tolerate well is
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;a noble goal--it is a form of flexibility and versatility--but I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;don't like the idea of &quot;tolerance&quot; in general as a positive value.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;I will not deny the existence of real evil in the world, and I do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not for a moment belive in tolerating it. 
</EM><BR>
<P>I think there is a difference between tolerating ideas and actions that are
<BR>
different from one's own views and coexisting with such, as separate from
<BR>
tolerating (as in allowing or accepting) evil to precipitate in one's
<BR>
environment.  As far as I understood the thread, Hal was referring to the
<BR>
former in regards to tolerance.
<BR>
<P>I agree with tolerance of evil. Why should anyone tolerate the instigation
<BR>
of bad faith or purposeful damaging acts of anyone or anything?  I do not
<BR>
tolerate it.  I see people tolerate such and it amazes me. (Vindictive
<BR>
behavior, intentionally damaging one's person or livelihood.) While I may
<BR>
not tolerate it, I have a choice of whether I will instigate an act to
<BR>
protect myself, or whether I will move as far away from it as possible
<BR>
(emotional/intellectual judo). I admire those who stands up to evil spit in
<BR>
its multi-charactered face.
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; It is much the same
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with &quot;peace&quot;, another thing some people see as a value in itself
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;that I do not.  Peace is merely a side effect of justice, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;sometimes justice must be fought for.  I think the underlying
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;value is not tolerance itself, but flexibility in dealing with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;varying circumstances one may face in the world.
</EM><BR>
<P>Again, I think this is was Hal was meaning, and so forth.  Queene later
<BR>
stated in this regard &quot;Tolerance of ideas and values is different from
<BR>
tolerance of puerile actions.&quot;  It's good to discuss and I'm glad you
<BR>
brought it up.
