_Death Is Not an Event in Life_ by James Still
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/still3.html">http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/features/2000/still3.html</A>
<BR>
This essay nicely illustrates a common flaw in atheist 
<BR>
thinking, namely the almost dogmatic rejection of 
<BR>
immortality, (mainly) because of its traditional link 
<BR>
with religion. The author doesn't even *consider* 
<BR>
scientific methods to achieve physical &quot;immortality&quot;. 
<BR>
Instead of actually trying to do something useful for 
<BR>
his dying father (i.e. try to get him frozen), he, in 
<BR>
his own words, &quot;stood silently next to him, holding his 
<BR>
hand, and watched helplessly as he slowly, yet steadily, 
<BR>
slipped away from us forever(*)&quot;. He then tries to justify 
<BR>
his impotent defeatism with a lot of fluffy blah blah about 
<BR>
how one can &quot;live forever&quot; without actually being immortal,
<BR>
that death gives meaning to life etc. The usual apologist 
<BR>
fallacies.
<BR>
<P>(*) ironic note: the author's father died in Phoenix,
<BR>
Arizona.
<BR>
<P>Now, what makes this depressing piece of deathist
<BR>
writing interesting is that there's an opportunity 
<BR>
to give feedback (see link at bottom of page), which, 
<BR>
assuming that it meets a very basic set of criteria, 
<BR>
will be published on the infidels.org website. Since 
<BR>
there's *very* little information regarding cryonics 
<BR>
and transhumanism to be found on this site (which is
<BR>
a major atheist resource), this might be a good 
<BR>
opportunity to &quot;put us on the map&quot;. The more people
<BR>
react to this, the better. Atheists, of all people,
<BR>
should be open to transhumanistic ideas, but these
<BR>
irrational deathist memes are holding them back.
<BR>
Perhaps repeated exposure to positive anti-memes can
<BR>
get at least some of them on the right track.
