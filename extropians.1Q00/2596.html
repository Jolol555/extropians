<EM> &gt; I HOPE TO GOD modifications will be adopted to make people *more* of an
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; individual and not bring even more soulless clones into existance. Fish
</EM><BR>
&nbsp;eyes
<BR>
<EM> &gt; and feathers, bring it on....
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; But more bland female model types, and isipid GQ types and we can all
</EM><BR>
<EM> &gt; ...CONFORM!! CONFORM!!! More more : Monotony, tedium, banality.
</EM><BR>

<BR>
&nbsp;Brian: You're all individuals
<BR>
&nbsp;Crowd: Yes we're all individuals
<BR>
&nbsp;Lone voice: I'm not!&gt;&gt;
<BR>
&nbsp;
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I'm not fond of conformity for the sake of conformity, but 
<BR>
neither am I a fan of being different simply to be different.  I want my 
<BR>
physical appearance to be what I like, what I want.  If that happens to be 
<BR>
what ninety percent of the population wants, hey, I can't fault their good 
<BR>
taste!  And if it happens to be what only one percent of the population 
<BR>
likes, then that's fine too, to each their own.  Now then, having said that, 
<BR>
there are a few other issues that come into the determination of my own 
<BR>
personal style, such as quality, functionality, access, ease, and 
<BR>
communications.  I want my material self to be durable and to allow me to do 
<BR>
the things I wish to.  Currently, I tend to limit myself to things I can find 
<BR>
without extra-ordinary effort or investment.  I want something that doesn't 
<BR>
take hours to arrange to my satisfation (seconds would be preferable&lt;G&gt;).  
<BR>
And I want my physical appearance to send only those messages I intend it to. 
<BR>
&nbsp;For example, I might like the whole idea of a cloak, but in daily life it 
<BR>
would make people uneasy, which is not a message I normally wish to send.  So 
<BR>
instead I wear my labcoat open so I get that nice flapping in the breaze 
<BR>
effect as I rush to a code, and when I go outside I like to wear a long black 
<BR>
coat, again open if it isn't too cold (and if it is, then close it up to 
<BR>
restore full functionality, which in my book trumps appearance).  My personal 
<BR>
asthetics remain, but I adapt them for the setting.  I imagine I will do much 
<BR>
the same in a bod mod future, and highly recommend the approach to others.  
<BR>
Remember, though, as in the Life of Brian comment above, the rush to be 
<BR>
&quot;different&quot; can be just as slavish to outside forces as the rush to &quot;fit in&quot;.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having said all this, I imagine the look of the future population will be 
<BR>
more heterogeneous, but with an overall retention of guassian distributions 
<BR>
within the same environments, though we may see several multi-modal 
<BR>
distributions when humanity's descendants are taken as a whole due to 
<BR>
adaptations to local conditions (that's one of the reasons for businessmen 
<BR>
wearing chinos in California and suits in New York).
