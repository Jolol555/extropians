<EM>&gt;  If I understand the slant of your remark  it would be appropriate to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;respond by asking where the Library of Congress, as well all most of the libraries around the country come from?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>The idea of a library is not exactly new; it could deserve the name
<BR>
of Initiative in Alexandria, but now it's more of a rudimentary 
<BR>
- though undoubtedly useful  - _service_.
<BR>
The &quot;cyber Library of Congress&quot; metaphor definitely refers to
<BR>
the scale of the undertaking rather than accurately describes
<BR>
its nature.
<BR>
<P>All advanced projects on the Internet that I can think of have
<BR>
been started by private individuals and companies; the role of
<BR>
the government is limited to watching for old issues (can a child
<BR>
see naked butts online?), providing general resources ($ for
<BR>
thicker carrier cables), and general regulation of development
<BR>
(such as patent laws).   
<BR>
<P>Even if the government was doing more good than harm in any of these
<BR>
areas, it would still mean that the visionary development is done by 
<BR>
private individuals, and the democratic governance is only able to
<BR>
provide support for already established structures.
<BR>
<P>If they could at least provide support to good ideas, it would
<BR>
be good - but I am not holding my breath.   I've been trying to
<BR>
throw good ideas to general consideration myself - it never worked;
<BR>
now, it appears that implementing them as businesses is a lot more
<BR>
practical...
<BR>
<P>Don't know if this may apply to the Cyber University.
<BR>
<P>If I had to build it, I'd build the infrastructure, and allow
<BR>
private individuals to improve on it, offer better courses, etc.
<BR>
<P>Should I suggest this idea to the government?  :-)
<BR>
<P>My prediction is that it will be done like this anyway.
<BR>
Reality has its imperatives whether anybody realizes them
<BR>
or not.
