</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Well one form of denial is relgion, simply because its a way of dealing 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;frustration with an intolerable situation.  One observation is that what
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;happens if a person is away from their cryo tank when the end comes?
</EM><BR>
<P>Hey, there are no guarantees.  If I happen to be in Mozambique when I come 
<BR>
down with a bad case of sudden death, chances are I will have missed the 
<BR>
train.  But for just that reason, I don't plan to do much traveling out of 
<BR>
range of my cryo-rescue team once I get to the old and feeble stage of my 
<BR>
life.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;about family and friends, are ya &quot;ok&quot; with the big goodbye to them, as long
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;as you survive?
</EM><BR>
<P>I love my friends and family to pieces and would love for them to reach the 
<BR>
promised land with me.  But they are mostly deep into the theistic deathist 
<BR>
meme and consider me to be the heretic black sheep of the family.  So far no 
<BR>
luck convincing anybody I know and love to consider taking a shot at 
<BR>
immortality.  So, yeah, I'd love them to come along, but if I have to I'm 
<BR>
prepared to go it alone.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;It may not be a choice, however, I am desiring the BIG
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;solution as profferd by Moravec and Tipler. So far there has a paucity of 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;any
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;other thinkers exploring this area with any usuable ideas. Maybe it does 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;exist?
</EM><BR>
<P>What is the BIG solution?  Is that the resurrection of everybody who has 
<BR>
ever lived?  I've heard a little bit of discussion on that.  But I'm not 
<BR>
convinced.  In order to do that it seems to me that you'd have to recreate 
<BR>
almost all of a person's subjective experiences.  Sure a lot can be inferred 
<BR>
from accurate data about the person's recorded or remembered words and 
<BR>
deeds.  But once the brain has undergone dissolution, the great majority of 
<BR>
its patterns are in all likelihood lost forever.  I'd like to think it ain't 
<BR>
so, but I just can't wrap my brain around any convincing argument to that 
<BR>
effect.
<BR>

<P>&quot;I like dreams of the future better than the history of the past&quot;
