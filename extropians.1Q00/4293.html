<EM>&gt; Because of Travolta and others I developed a vague interest in scientology
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; until I read sections of a book at my local library that gave an insider's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; view on how the organization really operated.  I was shocked.  Needless to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; say, scientology leadership, I believe, successfully lobbied Amazon.com to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; remove it from their inventory.  The system does seem to help some, though.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I wonder how?

<P>A good freind of mine and his sisters were raised in Scientology, and were
<BR>
declared 'clear' by elron himself.  When elron got tossed off his yacht by some
<BR>
of the young turks, they proceeded to 'excommunicate' a number of individuals
<BR>
who opposed them, including my freind and one of his sisters. He told me that
<BR>
scientology is helpful as a source of mental discipline. Its not for everyone,
<BR>
and it has its share of kookyness like any religion. It just goes to show that
<BR>
any mental construct can be useful in the proper context.
