</EM><BR>
<P>Ok, I buy that. It makes sense. Thanks to everyone for informing me.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Don't get me wrong I want
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; us to go there and I feel we could live there.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Why?  I don't want to spend time near so much gravity.:)  I would prefer a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; free floating existence -
</EM><BR>
<P>Sounds like fun. Bound to get boring after a while. Probably have some
<BR>
dilitarious effects on ones bones and heart and a host of other things, but
<BR>
don't take my word for it.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; - or one inside a hollowed out asteroid.
</EM><BR>
<P>Let's do that too. In fact let's do that first! I've always contended that we
<BR>
need to finance both Moon and Mars colonization with asteroid mining first.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; I'd prefer to roam over staying on some world for thousands of years or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; more.  I've already been there, done that, 
</EM><BR>
<P>Que? Been there, done that? &quot;Splain Lucy!&quot; ;)
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; It's kind of cute how a lot of people want to move into space only to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; recreate Earth.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, Earth is THE environment we are, so far, adapted to. One reason might be
<BR>
we are running--scratch that--HAVE run out of space. Unfortunately the archain
<BR>
ideologies that support overpopulation don't appear to be abating any time soon.
<BR>
We might have an overpopulation &quot;singularity&quot; soon if we're not careful.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; You can read my essay on space colonization at my site.  It's probably not a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; tenth as good as Zubrin's book -- heck, it's much, much shorter -- but it's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; only a few mouse-clicks away.:)
</EM><BR>
<P>I'll check it out.
