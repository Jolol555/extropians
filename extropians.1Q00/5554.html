Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control Wins Two Department of Defense
<BR>
Nunn-Perry Awards
<BR>
<P>DALLAS, March 20 /PRNewswire/ -- Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control,
<BR>
located in Dallas and Orlando, has won two of the prestigious Department of
<BR>
Defense (DoD) Nunn-Perry Awards for its outstanding performance on the DoD
<BR>
Mentor-Protege program, which partners established contractors with small
<BR>
disadvantaged businesses.
<BR>
<P>The Nunn-Perry Awards are presented to DoD Mentor-Protege Teams that have
<BR>
excelled in the areas of quality technical assistance, return on investment
<BR>
and Protege development. The award was established in 1995 in honor of
<BR>
former Senator Sam Nunn, who sponsored the legislation that created the DoD
<BR>
Mentor Protege Program, and former Secretary of Defense William Perry, for
<BR>
his commitment to the program's implementation. Twelve Nunn-Perry Awards
<BR>
were presented this year.
<BR>
<P>The awards were presented to Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control on
<BR>
Friday, March 17, at the annual DoD Mentor-Protege Conference at the Ritz-
<BR>
Carlton, Pentagon City in Arlington, Virginia. Accepting the awards on
<BR>
behalf of Lockheed Martin was Robert B. Coutts, executive vice president,
<BR>
Systems Integration, for Lockheed Martin Corporation.
<BR>
<P>``Selection of our Missiles and Fire Control team for two Nunn-Perry Awards
<BR>
is a tremendous accomplishment indicative of Lockheed Martin's corporate
<BR>
commitment to partner with small disadvantaged businesses,'' Coutts said.
<BR>
``These awards also recognize our focus on providing customers high quality,
<BR>
cost effective solutions even as we assist our partner Protege companies in
<BR>
becoming world-class operations. I congratulate our Protege partners,
<BR>
Tecnico Corporation and T/J Technologies, along with our Systems Integration
<BR>
employees in Dallas and Orlando for their dedication to making this Defense
<BR>
Department program a success.''
<BR>
<P>In Dallas, Missiles and Fire Control's small disadvantaged business partner,
<BR>
Tecnico Corporation of Chesapeake, Virginia, worked with the company to
<BR>
produce composite midsection housing tubes for the Patriot Advanced
<BR>
Capability-3 (PAC-3) Missile, the new missile being produced by Missiles and
<BR>
Fire Control - Dallas for the U.S. Army's Patriot air defense system.
<BR>
<P>``Tecnico had chosen to diversify into a very high technology arena:
<BR>
composite materials fabrication,'' said Harry Karegeannes, vice president
<BR>
for Materials and Facilities at Missiles and Fire Control - Dallas. ``They
<BR>
were utilizing advanced fabrication processes, including one process that
<BR>
they licensed from NASA.''
<BR>
<P>Karegeannes said Lockheed Martin provided a full-time project manager, who
<BR>
split time between Tecnico and Dallas, providing composites manufacturing
<BR>
technology support to Tecnico. ``We also hired a contract engineer to be
<BR>
trained as a Tecnico project manager who will stay on with that company
<BR>
after this program ends,'' Karegeannes added. Lockheed Martin provided
<BR>
Tecnico with several large pieces of manufacturing equipment to support the
<BR>
composite manufacturing business, including an autoclave, lathe and several
<BR>
milling machines.
<BR>
<P>The results have included a significant increase in manufacturing capacity
<BR>
and quality of the Tecnico composites program. ``Tecnico has significantly
<BR>
increased their manufacturing system through this Mentor-Protege program,
<BR>
and we have gained a highly qualified, quality-focused subcontractor,''
<BR>
Karegeannes said. Because of its involvement and commitment to the program,
<BR>
Tecnico has expanded into the manufacture of hyperbaric chambers, which has
<BR>
led to the company providing hyperbaric chambers under contract to the U.S.
<BR>
Navy.
<BR>
<P>In Orlando, Protege partner T/J Technologies of Ann Arbor, Michigan, was
<BR>
instrumental in working with Missiles and Fire Control - Orlando to discover
<BR>
that nitride/carbide ultracapacitors can economically extend the life of
<BR>
batteries.
<BR>
<P>``Missiles and Fire Control and T/J Technologies have solved a dilemma,''
<BR>
said Dr. Les Kramer, director and Engineering Fellow at Missiles and Fire
<BR>
Control - Orlando. ``By applying modern materials technology to the
<BR>
fabrication of capacitors, we have developed the ultracapacitor, a type of
<BR>
capacitor which has energy storage capabilities well beyond the conventional
<BR>
electrolytic capacitors used in both military systems and consumer
<BR>
electronics. However, unlike batteries, the ultracapacitor can deliver very
<BR>
high power in a very small package; and we can do it economically compared
<BR>
to other ultracapacitors.''
<BR>
<P>Because of the cost and performance advantages associated with
<BR>
ultracapacitors, Missiles and Fire Control - Orlando teamed with T/J
<BR>
Technologies through an Air Force-funded Mentor-Protege research program to
<BR>
exploit ultracapacitors for military applications.
<BR>
<P>``We have successfully demonstrated that T/J Technologies' _nanotechnology_
<BR>
can be transitioned from the laboratory to an actual piece of deployed
<BR>
military hardware,'' Kramer said. Over the past 22 months, scientists and
<BR>
engineers from both companies have successfully scaled up the fabrication
<BR>
process that produced working prototype ultracapacitors. As a result, the
<BR>
Air Force recently funded a second phase of the program to continue
<BR>
fabrication development.
<BR>
<P>``The first phase was extremely successful, and we have even greater
<BR>
expectations from the second phase,'' according to Kramer. Since developing
<BR>
those initial prototype devices, numerous other potential applications
<BR>
associated with electric propulsion systems, improved communications radios,
<BR>
high power radar and smaller power sources have been identified for both
<BR>
military and commercial systems. The future looks very bright for this power
<BR>
source technology, and Lockheed Martin is currently planning several
<BR>
electronic system improvements for missiles and avionics based on these
<BR>
ultracapacitors.
<BR>
<P>Located in Dallas and Orlando, Lockheed Martin Missiles and Fire Control
<BR>
develops, manufactures and supports advanced combat, missile, rocket and
<BR>
space systems. The company is organized in seven program/mission areas:
<BR>
Strike Weapons, Air Defense, Anti-Armor, Naval Munitions, Fire Control and
<BR>
Sensors, Fire Support and Product Development.
<BR>
<P>Headquartered in Bethesda, Maryland, Lockheed Martin is a global enterprise
<BR>
principally engaged in the research, design, development, manufacture and
<BR>
integration of advanced-technology systems, products and services. The
<BR>
Corporation's core businesses are systems integration, space, aeronautics,
<BR>
and technology services.
