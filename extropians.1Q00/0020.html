Well, what do you know.  I'm posting news.
<BR>
<P>William Safire, in an op-ed column for today's _New York Times_, wonders if we 
<BR>
really should accept death.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.nytimes.com/library/opinion/safire/010100safi.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/opinion/safire/010100safi.html</A>
<BR>

<BR>
<P>I may be experiencing a little less surprise every time I hear something like 
<BR>
this mentioned in the mainstream media.  As usual, however, the transhumanist 
<BR>
subject is treated as though no one had ever thought of it before today.
<BR>
<P>Safire concludes:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This calendar-induced speculation is not directed at those of us
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;today who will probably keel over even before our genetic clocks run
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;out.  But for those readers of a distant tomorrow who will flip back
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;through the millennia to access The New York Times Archive, one will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;say, &quot;You know, this fellow was incredibly prescient.&quot;  And another will
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;respond, with all human skepticism, &quot;Sure, he was right -- but do you
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;really want to live forever?&quot;
<BR>
<P>Oh, yes, Safire's a real visionary.  No one ever thought of this before.  
<BR>
Maybe if all these all-too-human decendants read is the _New York Times_ op-ed 
<BR>
column archive.
<BR>
<P><P>There's a 1984 essay by Thomas Pynchon (&quot;Is It O.K. To Be a Luddite?&quot; 
<BR>
(available on the Web)).  His conclusion:
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If our world survives, the next great challenge to watch out for
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will come---you heard it here first---when the curves of research
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and development in artificial intelligence, molecular biology and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;robotics all converge.  Oboy.  It will be amazing and unpredictable,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and even the biggest of brass, let us devoutly hope, are going to be
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;caught flat-footed.
<BR>
<P>&quot;you heard it here first&quot;?  I can't tell if this is some sort of sarcasm.  Or 
<BR>
if he knows that most people reading the _New York Times_ Book Review (where 
<BR>
this was originally published) would indeed be hearing it there first.  Maybe 
<BR>
not.  This is Pynchon, who should know better.  He spends the previous 
<BR>
paragraphs praising science fiction but he's the first to foresee convergences 
<BR>
of these technologies?  I must be missing something.  And why does he hope 
<BR>
that we lack foresight?
