<P><EM>&gt; The odd and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  paradoxical 'behavior' of saying something bad about your own group, or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  something good about an enemy group, is a modern innovation confined to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  small groups of peculiar individuals; it is too infrequent to be
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  considered as a possible interpretation in social interactions.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;  -- 
</EM><BR>
<P>This is a very true statement.
<BR>
<P>I have found that this is just as much an anomaly on this list as anywhere 
<BR>
else.
<BR>
<P>I disagree that this is a behavior in the sense you speak of: ie: of a 
<BR>
programmed response to being shunned by one's peers. That happens, but it is 
<BR>
not always the case.
<BR>
If someone says something bad about one of the &quot;good&quot; ideas so popular here, 
<BR>
a gang flame usually ensues, and the person is assumed to be a 
<BR>
&quot;non-extropian&quot; and is called socialist or deathist or luddite or irrational 
<BR>
or spiritual or some other heinous insult : - )
<BR>
<P>...More to the point, they are assumed to hold *every* belief mentioned 
<BR>
above, if they don't tow the party line on every issue as the majority sees 
<BR>
it, and as the FAQ represents and are sometimes flamed off the list [IMO this 
<BR>
goes *against* the principles, but it still happens all too often]. Bad 
<BR>
&quot;behavior&quot; (insults, profanity,  lies, slander, etc.; -) is far less punished 
<BR>
on this list than disagreeing with a fundamental principle.
<BR>
<P><P>We are mentally aligned to be associated with a &quot;party&quot;, political or 
<BR>
otherwise. 
<BR>
&quot;Good and &quot;bad&quot; are more than just social propositions, they are hugely 
<BR>
debatable axioms that we rely upon for guidance through the murky sea of 
<BR>
conduct.
<BR>
<P>Note the use of the suffixes like &quot;ist&quot; and &quot;ian&quot; which strongly imply an 
<BR>
adherence to a particular bias. Group mind as Keostler calls it. 
<BR>
<P>I agree with you that it is *rare* to find people who think for themselves 
<BR>
and find potholes in dogma, but it's not a recent development, just an 
<BR>
unusual one.
