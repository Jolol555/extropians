Most people (including myself) are inherently uncomfortable with having

themselves dismantled and a replicant assembled elsewhere.  They really want 
<BR>
*themselves* to be move at light speed from one location to another. Until 
<BR>
each of us wrestles with the meme of &quot;what&quot; *we* really are its going to be 
<BR>
hard to be satisfied with transport rather than actual transport.

<P>I totally agree.  For the same reasons I do not want to be uploaded.  I 
<BR>
would only wind up with a perfect copy of me and so the process had better 
<BR>
not kill me! lol  I want an uploading process that actually takes my brain 
<BR>
and transforms it into a form of energy without any loss to the authentic 
<BR>
me.
