<EM>&gt; &gt; Long ago I concluded that a decent science fiction movie only gets made
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; about
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;  once a decade.  Would-be claimants to this honor can keep working: The
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; slot  for this decade is still open.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Until I saw &quot;13th floor&quot;  I was of the opinion that no decent SF movie HAD
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; been made.  13th Floor isn't really all that good...but it's head and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; shoulders above most other SF movies......
</EM><BR>
<P>I thought &quot;eXistenZ&quot; was better than &quot;13th Floor,&quot; but both were more
<BR>
believable than &quot;The Matrix.&quot;  The last, however, had the best effects and
<BR>
once I got past the stupid premise, it was okay, if a little predictable.
<BR>
I'd still like to know what would've happened if he took BOTH pills.:)
<BR>
<P>However, none of the above would be on my list of the best science fiction
<BR>
films of the past ten years.  On that, I'd probably place &quot;The Ghost in the
<BR>
Shell&quot; and &quot;Dark City&quot; near the top.  Surely, the latter was more science
<BR>
fantasy, but it was done well, both in effects and story.  The former was
<BR>
excellent, though the dialogue is a bit wordy and too fast.  Maybe this is
<BR>
part of the translation.  (It's Japanese anime and instead of the usual
<BR>
space opera crap, it's actually a cyberpunk cartoon with a flair for
<BR>
realism.)  &quot;The Arrival&quot; was also good, though not original.  It hearkens
<BR>
back to 1950s style paranoid scifi film, but it's updated very well.
<BR>
&quot;Twelve Monkeys&quot; might also be in there, though given the time travel
<BR>
premise, it's more fantasy than science to me.
<BR>
<P>I'm sure I missed others.  I did see &quot;Pi&quot; which was a good effort, but
<BR>
flawed nonetheless.  It's not in my picks.  See my Film/TV section at my
<BR>
site for more of my tastes in this area.
<BR>
<P>Maybe we could all get together and put out a list of what our favorite
<BR>
science fiction films were...  Whoa!  That would be a nasty thread that
<BR>
would probably rise again and again, wasting bandwidth...  And I'm sure it's
<BR>
already been done here.:/
<BR>
<P>Cheers!
