<P><EM>&gt; Since both of your questions, Robert, are among my top ten, would
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it be asking too much for you to list your other eight?
</EM><BR>
<P>1) Are the sources of the gravitational microlensing observations
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;universally distributed around our galaxy and are they engineered
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;objects?  [a subset of What is the Missing Mass?].
<BR>
<P>2) What are the speed-limits to self-replication?
<BR>
<P>3) What are the speed-limits to evolution?
<BR>
<P>4) How many really useful &quot;biochemistries&quot; (i.e. chemical systems
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that can support self-replicating self-assembling machines)
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;are there and which of those can arise without conscious
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;intervention?  [A variant of &quot;How big is the phase-space for life?&quot;]
<BR>
<P>5) Are there feasible ways of creating alterverses, particularly
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those where you have rigged the fundamental physical laws and
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constants?  [Interesting because I'm pretty sure we are doomed
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if all the baryonic matter decays and universe-tunneling is
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;disallowed.]
<BR>
<P>6) What is the probability that an amoral, self-evolving, self-replicating
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AI/Alife can develop and &quot;breakout&quot; by accident?  { After all, the
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;computers and the net *are* an environmental niche... }
<BR>
<P>8) What is the molecular size to which a human body must be reduced
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that molecular nanotechnology cannot reassemble you?  [At some
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;point you end up with too many 3D pieces that look identical, with
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;too little positional information, to reassemble Humpty Dumpty.]
<BR>
<P>7) What do SIs think about over trillions of years?
<BR>
<P>9) What are the optimal computing architecures for what SIs think about?
<BR>
<P>And number 10, on RBs Top-Ten-List is:
<BR>
<P>10) Am I going to make it?
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Because if Robin is right about the spoils going to the first, *or*
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezer is successful in creating a fundamentally different AI, *or*
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the luddites rise up and drive us back a century or more,
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*or* *or* *or*...  my feeling is that the odds aren't good.  But(!),
<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;arriving is not so important as having an enjoyable journey.]
<BR>
<P>But thats just this morning.  Ask on another day and you may get
<BR>
a different set.  Sorry, no questions about philosophy, morality,
<BR>
etc.  While I have those too, I probably need a different environment
<BR>
(not staring at a wall of technical books) to raise them to the
<BR>
level of consciousness.
<BR>
<P>: Caesar       Who is it in the press that calls on me?
<BR>
:              I hear a tongue shriller than all the music
<BR>
:              Cry &quot;Caesar!&quot; Speak. Caesar is turned to hear.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Soothsayer   Beware the ides of March.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Caesar       What man is that?
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Brutus       A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Caesar       Set him before me; let me see his face.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Cassius      Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Caesar       What say'st thou to me now? Speak once again.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Soothsayer   Beware the ides of March.
<BR>
:
<BR>
: Caesar       He is a dreamer. Let us leave him. Pass.
<BR>
:
<BR>
:                               (Julius Caesar 1.2.15-24)
