<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;way conservative on when we get human equivalent computing.  The hard
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;part will be whether good AI takes 5 years or 20, but that's in Eliezer's,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;Doug's and a few others hands.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Hey, I love Eli like a son (not necessarily the most favorable comparison,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; if one reads his autobiographic sketch, but still...), admire the hell out
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of his smarts and articulateness, but let's not forget that so far all he's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; done is talk a good game.
</EM><BR>
<P>Well, I'd like to point out, for the record, that so far I haven't
<BR>
*claimed* to do anything more.  If anyone gets confused over this, it's
<BR>
not my fault.  Besides, you can always read &quot;Eliezer&quot; as indicating
<BR>
&quot;someone filling the 'Eliezer' slot in the script&quot;, which is how I've
<BR>
always read such statements.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; (Even that might be putting it a little strongly: the only formal AI expert
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; on the list, Robin Hanson, has expressed misgivings over Eliezer's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; broad-brush and non-canonical algorithms/heuristics, and I haven't seen
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; anyone cluey like Moravec or Vinge rush to adopt his schemata, although
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; they both know about his site.)
</EM><BR>
<P>Moravec knows about my site?  Interesting.  *I* didn't know that.  Did
<BR>
Moravec make any comments, or by &quot;knows&quot; do you mean &quot;said he's heard
<BR>
about it but not actually read anything&quot;, like Vinge?  If the latter, it
<BR>
hardly counts as input to the Bayesian probability theorem, if you take
<BR>
my meaning.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Sure, it's cheery to mention each other in such glowing terms, but it might
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be preferable to see some code that does something in the world, or to make
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the world jump up and down waving dollar bills, before we assume that one
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of our number is the new Knuth.
</EM><BR>
<P>I understand the instinct to look for cheaters in a social situation,
<BR>
but it seems to me that there's not much I can do about that.  If I
<BR>
wrote an AI tomorrow and it proved the Goldbach Conjecture on Thursday,
<BR>
someone would still say I was a poseur.  Unless writing an AI is going
<BR>
to actually advance the state of the art - which, unaided, would
<BR>
probably take a huge chunk of full-time work, and I can't do that unless
<BR>
I get paid - then it's just an ego trip.  _Coding a Transhuman AI_ isn't
<BR>
working code, no, but the people *I'm* interested in can generally
<BR>
perceive that it's different enough to be worth trying, and that's the
<BR>
prerequisite for getting far enough to try.
<BR>
<P>How much progress do you expect, anyway?  I said in _Coding_ that it'd
<BR>
be a huge job.  I said we'd have to dump most of AI and start over.  It
<BR>
took Drexler 12 years to go from the first paper to _Nanosystems_; it's
<BR>
been only 1.5 years since I set the clock back.  If I am everything that
<BR>
I say I am, even everything that others have thought me to be, you still
<BR>
wouldn't *expect* me to get any farther than I've gotten with no
<BR>
funding, no support, and having to spend most of my time pushing the
<BR>
idea far enough to set up a support organization.  By the Bayesian
<BR>
probability theorem, therefore, estimates of what I can do will have to
<BR>
depend on your own ability to read _Coding_ et. al. and judge for
<BR>
yourself the mind that wrote it.  If Robert Bradbury thinks I,
<BR>
specifically, am likely to play a part in the Singularity, and he wasn't
<BR>
just using &quot;Eliezer&quot; in the sense of &quot;some bright young unexpected
<BR>
fellow with a plan&quot;, then that's his lookout.
<BR>
<P>Yes, I'm annoyed.  It's all very well and good to remind the audience
<BR>
that I haven't produced the code, but I think the audience also deserves
<BR>
to be reminded that Drexler Himself couldn't produce the code in my
<BR>
situation.  Drexler talked a good game back in 1981, and he *still*
<BR>
hasn't come up with any hardware, and you know what?  It needed doing,
<BR>
or Foresight and Great Mambo Chicken and the Singularitarian mailing
<BR>
list wouldn't exist today.  Twenty years later, Drexler's good game is
<BR>
finally starting to look real, and it wouldn't have happened without
<BR>
Drexler being willing to go out on a limb and get shot at by people who
<BR>
thought that he was just talking a good game.  Talking a good game -
<BR>
being willing to get out there with no backup and no portfolio and talk
<BR>
about changing the world - is part of the process of getting into a
<BR>
position to produce the goods and change the world, and I will not
<BR>
apologize for any of it.
