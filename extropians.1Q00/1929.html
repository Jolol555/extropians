Mentioned in the previous post (and I am not singling you out, Bob, this is 
<BR>
a common thread continued by many extropes) was the idea of removing poor 
<BR>
genes from the gene pool. In the context of modern society, the idea of 
<BR>
improving the human gene pool by evolutionary methods, as a worthy goal, is 
<BR>
just silly. Genes just aren't that important any more, and are certainly not 
<BR>
worth killing anyone for, even passively by letting someone die. The economy 
<BR>
of ideas and technology (the stuff we can do) must be predominant.
<BR>
(end)
<BR>
<P>I totally agree on these points.  I still encounter people with the idea 
<BR>
that we need some kind of Nazi-style selective breeding plan to keep &quot;the 
<BR>
race strong!&quot;  Nature has it's own ways of maintaining the gene pool with 
<BR>
the various ways humans have of attracting mates through beauty, health and 
<BR>
intelligence among others.  The way nature has it, some parts of the gene 
<BR>
pool are just deeper then others but it is all the same pool.  Anyway, 
<BR>
fairly soon genetic engineering will be here and parents with the money will 
<BR>
be buying the best traits they can for their offspring.  And even with a 
<BR>
healthy genome, a person still needs the right nurturing and sense of 
<BR>
ambition to succeed in an economy of ideas and technology.
<BR>
