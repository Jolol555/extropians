Living forever, they say isn't fair!!

We must leave things alone, now -- and how do we DARE!!

<P>This is great stuff!  This needs to be fleshed out into a full-size book 
<BR>
with Seussian style artwork to go along with it!  When you said you were an 
<BR>
artist I thought you meant a painter/sculpter and not also an author.
<BR>
<P>Don't drop the ball!  This incredibly fun book-in-the-making will be a 
<BR>
classic, not just among transhumanists but future oriented people 
<BR>
everywhere.  And it could be the first of a series.  I would order several 
<BR>
copies now if it were available.  I remember you mentioning how you would 
<BR>
like to have more money, now this is the way to do it!!
<BR>
<P>Please consider what I've said.  You have created a seed that should be 
<BR>
allowed to sprout and not die.
<BR>
<P><P>sincerely,
<BR>
