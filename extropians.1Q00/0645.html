<EM>&gt;Ja me too.  {8^D  However, as I said, I have to my own satisfaction

<EM>&gt;determined that the notion of a universal power casting into the lake

<EM>&gt;of fire those who fail to believe, is one that evolved in order for

</EM><BR>
<P><P>Dear john grigg:
<BR>
<P>and so it should bother you, john, so it should.  It was a concept of Hell
<BR>
that gave birth to my first questions about the veracity of the gospel of
<BR>
Jesus Christ.  For more information on how I lost my religion, please visit
<BR>

<BR>
<P><P>1. Will there be more people in Hell for all eternity or in Heaven?
<BR>
<P>2. How must God feel, if even one of His creation is in Hell?
<BR>
<P>3. When God started things off in the beginning, did He know that this is
<BR>
how things would turn
<BR>
out?
<BR>
<P>4. Did He know that He would send His only Son to die a horrible death and
<BR>
even temporary         separation from His Father?
<BR>
<P>5. If He did, how could He possibly have thought this was a good plan?
<BR>
<P>6. Was it His only option?
<BR>
<P>7. What good will Hell do? What good is it doing? If it's supposed to be a
<BR>
deterrent, it doesn't
<BR>
seem to be working, does it?
<BR>
<P>8. Wouldn't such a good God be able to attract people to Himself because of
<BR>
His good attributes?
<BR>
<P>9. Does God need to use fear to attract souls to Himself? Does He not have
<BR>
unlimited good options?
<BR>
<P>10. Wouldn't any sane, fully informed individual be attracted to God if He
<BR>
revealed Himself fully?
<BR>
<P>11. And how could anyone, if not fully informed or completely sane, be held
<BR>
liable for a misuse of their free will?
<BR>
<P>12. Can you imagine anything that a child of yours could do that would make
<BR>
you feel justified in
<BR>
seeing them tortured for one hour, let alone for all eternity?
<BR>
<P>I'm getting carried away, but certainly He could have come up with a better
<BR>
plan.  Whether there are one billion or ten billion human beings being
<BR>
eternally tortured in Hell, its' a hideous scenario, one for which no other
<BR>
human being should ever find consolation.
<BR>
<P>The Gospel message is not now, and has never been, available to any more
<BR>
than a small minority.  If loss of innocence comes from hearing, then
<BR>
evangelists &amp; missionaries are delivering the ultimate jeopardy.
<BR>
<P>Since with God all things are possible, and since God is not willing that
<BR>
any should perish, don’t you think He might have a better plan?  One that is
<BR>
more successful, at least from the perspective of those who die,
<BR>
unconvinced.
<BR>
<P>Don’t you think, if God loves us and wants us to love Him, of our own free
<BR>
will, He wouldn’t have created Satan and Hell, particularly knowing in
<BR>
advance that a significant number of us would end up there?
<BR>
<P>Can you imagine, from the perspective of humanity, any worse plan, unless
<BR>
perhaps it included fewer of us.
<BR>
<P>Rick

<EM>&gt;Subject: Christ, evangelicals and divine punishments...
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;....I was fascinated by the thread about Jesus Christ.  I had already read
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;various views on his historical origins but still found the discussion to
</EM><BR>
be
<BR>
<EM>&gt;food for thought.  I believe Christ to have lived and also to have been
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;divine but can see how people could contend over his origins.  I must do my
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;own research to see how accurate the posts were of certain people as to the
</EM><BR>
<P><EM>&gt;evidence or lack of regarding him.  I find it very hard to believe that a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;person could take the view that Christ never even existed.  From a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;legalistic view at least it would seem very definite that he did.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Personally, I find it very easy to believe that christ never existed.
<BR>
Here's a great piece that is well written and exhaustively documented about
<BR>
the historical origins of Christianity itself and the historicity (or lack
<BR>
thereof) of jesus.
