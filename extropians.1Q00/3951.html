<P>Jeepers, we have &quot;Dumbasses&quot; and &quot;Lazyasses&quot;... If those memes get
<BR>
crossed we will have &quot;Dumb&amp;LazyAsses&quot;.  Isn't there supposed to be
<BR>
some process of natural selection that eliminates such things...
<BR>
<P>Perhaps we should require such people to do penance as singularitarian
<BR>
missionaries on the &quot;Born Again&quot; christian newsgroups and don't
<BR>
allow them to return to the fold until the bring back some converts.
<BR>
<P>However, as one of the many who from time to time messes up the email
<BR>
reply protocol in my mailer, I think we should all let these go
<BR>
with the Fish-ism.... Byegones.
