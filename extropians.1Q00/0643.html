<EM>&gt; &gt; One of the greatest blessings of modern synths is the depth of the sonic
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; possibilities, but very few artists take the time to learn to program new
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sounds.  The amazing sounds these machines can make is what attracts me to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; them in the first place.  I cringe when I hear popular music where the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; sounds are so obvious that I can name the machine and patch number.  What
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; is the point of using a synth if you aren't going to add something to the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; soundscape?
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I agree, and it goes for traditional instruments too. How many times have I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; heard Ben Fold's Five playing, for instance, and thought to myself &quot;jeez,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that's just a plain old piano he's playing. How mediocre&quot;.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Actually, yes, and some instruments are more limited than others.  The
<BR>
piano, to use your example, is quite limited.  One of the things that
<BR>
caused me to stray from the piano (which I have been playing since I was a
<BR>
wee tot) was that if you wanted to create any substantial change in the
<BR>
sound of the piano you had to find a different piano.  Guitars are
<BR>
actually much more versatile in this regard.
<BR>
<P>Ben Fold's Five may be very nice piano playing, but the composition is
<BR>
awfully ordinary.  Perhaps my listening goals are different than yours.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; &gt; I am generally in complete agreement with you.  The sounds themselves
</EM><BR>
can't &gt; &gt; carry a well-written piece, particularly if the sounds are
<BR>
canned.  The &gt; &gt; ability to build deep and interesting musical constructs
<BR>
from its basic &gt; &gt; components is still an essential skill for making great
<BR>
music; to &gt; &gt; integrate carefully designed sounds just adds to the
<BR>
experience. &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern technology lets a person with
<BR>
mediocre skills &quot;pass&quot; &gt; &gt; for having talent, by letting the machine do
<BR>
all the work (basically &gt; &gt; utilizing the creativity of the person who
<BR>
programmed the machine at the &gt; &gt; factory).
<BR>
<EM>&gt; 
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I'd say the opposite to the above; the sounds themselves can't carry a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; poorly written piece, and don't have to carry a well written one. 
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Uhh...that is what I stated above.  I don't think we are actually in
<BR>
disagreement on this part.  Good composition is essential.  Good sound
<BR>
design makes a good composition even better.  Music by someone who uses the
<BR>
same instrument with the same sound over and over and over gets boring for
<BR>
me.
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; With the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; argument above, all music written earlier than last year is crap by
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; definition, because the sounds are so &quot;canned&quot; compared to now. Listened to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the Beatles lately? Cruddy production, hackneyed electric guitar/bass/drums
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; arrangement. How'd they get a recording contract?
</EM><BR>
<P><P>Even &quot;old&quot; sounds can be fresh if worked into a new setting or revitalized
<BR>
with new and creative processing and production techniques.  Moreover,
<BR>
some older compositions sound best when used with the original
<BR>
instrumentation.  Some old sounds are unique because of changes in
<BR>
production equipment and technique.  You've over-simplified it.  It would
<BR>
be difficult to replicate the sound of the Beatles because the overall
<BR>
sound is a combination of a lot of factors, some of which (such as the
<BR>
exact equipment in the signal path) would be difficult to reconstruct. 
<BR>
But the fact is, while some of the production techniques on the Beatles
<BR>
albums were considered innovative in their time, some have proven to be
<BR>
very poor ideas with 30 years of hindsight.  There are some aspects to
<BR>
Beatle recordings that are unique because no sound engineer would ever use
<BR>
those techniques today.  
<BR>
<P>&quot;Cruddy production&quot; is relative.  Have you heard what passes for
<BR>
modern production in a country such as India?  Tracks drenched in tinny
<BR>
reverb with the frequency response of an AM radio, even on relatively
<BR>
clean mediums such as CD.  There is no accounting for taste, I suppose.
<BR>
<P>Actually a disturbing production trend in popular American music is poor
<BR>
mastering.  There is an arms race to put the hottest signal possible down,
<BR>
which has made distortion and compression artifacts increasingly
<BR>
common for a lot of popular genres.  Sacrificing audio quality for
<BR>
loudness probably is an indication of something...
<BR>
<P><P><EM>&gt; Good sounds are very cool (I'll be trying to get myself the hardware for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; really nice sounds ASAP). But they absolutely play second (or third or
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; fourth) fiddle to good composition. I'd rather hear Bach on a vic chip than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; plenty of the more mediocre modern stuff that uses the most expensive
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; equipment.
</EM><BR>
<P><P>I am not a huge proponent of buying the latest, greatest synth technology.
<BR>
You get far more mileage by learning how to really use an older synth than
<BR>
by blowing money on the next hot machine to come off the assembly line.  A
<BR>
master programmer using an old Oberheim will almost always do something
<BR>
more interesting than Joe Preset with the latest mass market Roland box.
<BR>
<P>Interestingly, I used to sequence Bach concerto's (which usually have 10
<BR>
or 12 parts) into my computer and then mess around with the voicing and
<BR>
arrangement.  Virtually all the voices were composed with such tight
<BR>
tolerances that I had to be very careful with choosing and tweaking new
<BR>
voicings or the concerto's would completely unravel.  It gave me a new
<BR>
appreciation of how carefully those concertos had been constructed.  Very
<BR>
few musicians can weave such a tight and detailed composition.  It is
<BR>
interesting how much the composition tolerances differ for different
<BR>
composers.
<BR>
<P>&nbsp;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; Actually, for good sounds, what I really want to get my hands on is an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; orchestra...
</EM><BR>
<P>Orchestras provide a very rich sonic environment.  So many oscillators...
