Mike Lorrey wrote, in reply to my post:
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; They own it [stock] whether they know it or not...
</EM><BR>
<P>Perhaps, but I don't think that indirect ownership acts to effect the
<BR>
suggested benefits of the original post; i.e. it doesn't provide freedom
<BR>
from governmental interference.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Since increased artificial mind augmentation will add increased
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logical abilities to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the average person, then the amount of illogical reasoning will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; by definition
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; decline...
</EM><BR>
<P>That doesn't follow, Mike. Increased logical reasoning does not
<BR>
automatically decrease illogical reasoning. For logical reasoning to 'win
<BR>
out' it has to be considered favourable to that of illogical reasoning, and
<BR>
there's no guarantee that augmentation will or, indeed, should, bring that
<BR>
about.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; So long as productivity growth and resource availability increase
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; faster than
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; population growth, then we remain on the track toward relatively
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; unlimited resources.
</EM><BR>
<P>But not to unrestricted and equal access to those resources for all, which
<BR>
was my point.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; The market will decide what is good and what is bad.
</EM><BR>
<P>No, it won't. It will merely decide what the majority consider good and bad,
<BR>
as it does now. You can't claim universal 'goodness' or 'badness' for
<BR>
something.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Individuals,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; as they gain more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; logical, computational abilities, will understand more and more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that power domination
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; strategies are not beneficial to one's true self interest.
</EM><BR>
<P>Why wouldn't they be? Note, I'm not asking why _are_ they in one's self
<BR>
interest, I'm asking why they are actively _against_ that best interest.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;         Oh, I don't know. Perhaps 'guilt' and 'loneliness' will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; be considered
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; negative, 'bad', emotions, and someone will have decided to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; wire them out,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; as you suggested.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Anyone who thinks that eliminating emotions is a good thing has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; some issues to work
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; out. Being transhuman does not mean less human, it means more
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; human, better human. I
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; don't see how you can acheive this by subtraction.
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree with you one hundred percent: that was the point of my comment.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; &gt;         We are not about to overcome all future suffering, and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; the removal of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; death, and resurrection of the dead, will not end all evil.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If our projections of the future are reasonably accurate...
</EM><BR>
&lt;snip&gt;
<BR>
<EM>&gt; I estimate that this means about a 90% decrease in the fatality rate.
</EM><BR>
<P>Sorry, my comment wasn't clear. I should have written, &quot;We are not about to
<BR>
overcome all future suffering. Furthermore, the removal of death, and
<BR>
resurrection of the dead, will not end all evil.&quot; I do think removal of
<BR>
death is entirely possible, but that won't end evil or suffering. Why should
<BR>
it?
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Nobody who is not frozen can truly be resurrected...
</EM><BR>
<P>I agree.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Many, but not all people, are happy to die. Many, but not all
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; people are not happy with
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; their lives... see a resemblance?
</EM><BR>
<P>Yes, but not a one-to-one mapping by any means.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; However, there are things that
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; all sane people do
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; agree on. Those things can be defined as 'good'.
</EM><BR>
<P>There are very few things that _all_ sane people agree on, and you are in
<BR>
grave danger of creating a circular definition of sanity, whereby those who
<BR>
are to be considered sane are those who agree on certain things.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt; Also, due to evolutionary fitness,
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; there are things which are more good or more bad than others.
</EM><BR>
<P>This is, at best, a restrictive definition of 'good' and 'bad'. &quot;Good&quot; and
<BR>
&quot;bad&quot; go far beyond evolutionary fitness. For an assessment of something's
<BR>
being 'good' or 'bad' to rest on its evolutionary value all other
<BR>
considerations (cultural, societal, moral...) would have to be indeterminate
<BR>
or ignored. For me, that's a 'bad' thing.
