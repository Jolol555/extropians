<EM>&gt; &gt; I understand &quot;Transhumanism&quot; to be a philosophy of life and neither a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; social nor political ideology.  It does not seem possible to me for us to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; deduce or infer principles of government or public administration from
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; the axioms of our philosophy.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; A philosophy of life necessarily has political implications, even if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; it does not imply a system of government. For example, banning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; self-modification would be against the transhumanist values and a
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; correct transhumanist response would be to work against such an
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; attempted ban. Also, if there is a choice between different principles
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; of government some may be good or bad as evaluated by the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; transhumanist values.
</EM><BR>
<P>I suppose I would agree, Anders, that most philosophies of life have
<BR>
social or cultural implications. What you describe is a situation in
<BR>
which Extropians found themselves outlawed, or at least officially
<BR>
prohibited from engaging in their practice.  In the Western democracies
<BR>
this would not be a political but a constitutional (i.e. legal) issue, and if
<BR>
there was a remedy, it would be found in the courts, and not in social
<BR>
or political action.
<BR>
<P>Further, it does not seem to me that the practice of Extropianism
<BR>
depends on the vagaries of public opinion or sentiment, or on the
<BR>
prevailing political climate.  Of course one is free to imagine scenarios
<BR>
in which this position is tested, but all of them seem unlikely to me.
