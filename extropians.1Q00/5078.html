<P><EM>&gt;Given the recent newspaper article, where I think it was claimed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt;60% (!) of Americans supported teaching both the theories of
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;creationism and evolution side-by-side, of course it doesn't take
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;much to realize that if parents move their children en-mass to
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&quot;religious&quot; education, we are going to end up with a larger fraction
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;of the population who cannot think &quot;rationally&quot;.  [Unless you
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;believe in the pipe-dream that a &quot;religious&quot; education will
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;promote rational thought and downplay &quot;miracles&quot;.]
</EM><BR>
<P>You may be getting a distorted view of the likely effects of widespread 
<BR>
voucher use (or tax-credits for education) based on the small percentage of 
<BR>
private schools today (many of which are fundamentalist Protestant). For 
<BR>
one thing, Catholic schools probably would give a better education and, 
<BR>
especially since the Poop, um Pope, recognized evolution, would not have a 
<BR>
problem with modern biology. I have also taught at a Catholic college and 
<BR>
found them to be open to non-Catholic teaching (very unlike Protestant 
<BR>
colleges).
<BR>
<P>A second point, my regular surveys of my class show that logic, reasoning, 
<BR>
and evolution are NOT now being taught to 95% of high school students in 
<BR>
state schools. So things could hardly get worse.
<BR>
<P><EM>&gt;Now, fairly often the finger-of-blame for the poor-quality public
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;education goes to the teacher's unions.  How do extropians reconcile
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;the freedom people should have to organize for collective barginning
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;with the result (which seems to be the freedom to teach poorly)?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since most of us don't think the state should be in the business of 
<BR>
education, this isn't an issue.
