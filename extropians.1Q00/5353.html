<P><EM>&gt; &gt; Many comments, Octavio. I would prefer to see what others have
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; say before respond.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Me too, I am interested in receiving input from both us and non
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; us citizens, and compare the differences of opinion
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; But you have said precisely what everyone abroad who has
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; actually EXPERIENCED the effect of Corporate Imperialism
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; [we euphemistically refer to it the was you did, as &quot;American
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; Interests&quot; a P.R. triumph for corporate America] will say if
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; &gt; they feel they can speak candidly.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; And yes here we feel the effects of corporate capitalism a lot.
</EM><BR>
<P>I have a friend, Octavio, who is a doctor; he is very sympathetic
<BR>
to the cause of social development and social justice in your
<BR>
country.
<BR>
<P>I would like to have your permission to send him a PRIVATE
<BR>
copy of your brilliant letter.  I will tell him that he is NOT to
<BR>
send it to anyone else without YOUR permission.  Only this
<BR>
Forum and my friend the doctor will know of your letter,
<BR>
and you may trust me on that promise.
<BR>
<P>May I also say that when Americans like myself say things that
<BR>
are critical of our country, which we love as much as you do
<BR>
yours, it is because we are trying to understand things better
<BR>
and to find better ways of solving our own problems. For every
<BR>
bad thing I might say about the United States, I could easily
<BR>
say three very good things.
<BR>
<P>Just one more thing: when we speak honestly about the greed
<BR>
of some American corporations, we are talking about a business
<BR>
organization and its practices.  Often, most if not all of the
<BR>
Americans who work for this corporation are as greedy, but no
<BR>
more greedy, than you or I.  But complex organizations have
<BR>
a life of their own, and often situations arise where no one is
<BR>
really in control of operations, so that the evil, if there is any,
<BR>
refers to a human invention, and not necessarily to those who
<BR>
can earn their living because we created what at times behaves
<BR>
like a monster.
<BR>
<P>Thank you for your letter,
<BR>
<P>Bob
