<P>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Since it only recently is qulity lpngevity and a cure for death &quot;up for
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;discussion&quot; in any rational circle, and people have for CENTURIES sought
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;comfort in finding justification and &quot;need&quot; for it, both religious and
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;evolutionary -- probably to soften the pain of it's inevitability, how can we
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;expect a sudden mass change of heart?
</EM><BR>
<P>Since evolutionary psychology is highly regarded on this list, it might be 
<BR>
useful to apply its principles to this topic.
<BR>
<P>Start with the historical/evolutionary fact that we *do* degrade with the 
<BR>
passage of time, but have evolved anyway to live for decades past our 
<BR>
strict use-by date (a few years after menopause, say). This might just be 
<BR>
due to a series of accidents; we are over-engineered for the wild, and in 
<BR>
the supportive environment of technological culture we can stave off many 
<BR>
of the normal hazards of living with decaying organ systems, increasing 
<BR>
numbers of cellular mutations, sub-optimal mitochondria, etc. None the 
<BR>
less, given that this persistence into senescence *has happened*, it 
<BR>
provided a window for evolution (either genetic or mimetic or both 
<BR>
reinforcing each other) to craft people into typical age-framed roles.
<BR>
<P>So perhaps your genetic and mimetic inclusive fitness is increased (say) if 
<BR>
you move contentedly through a sequence of behaviours consonant with your 
<BR>
increasing frailty, decreased excitability, condensed memory (wisdom?), 
<BR>
etc. Just as we are programmed with time-activated templates for latency, 
<BR>
puberty, parenthood and grandparenthood (although these can be modified by 
<BR>
choice, with greater flexibility the later the phases occur, maybe), 
<BR>
perhaps we are also pre-fitted with propensities that make us suitable 
<BR>
oldsters in a community.
<BR>
<P>If so, people rightly get nervous or sarcastic when they see `old' men or 
<BR>
women `making fools of themselves' by `not acting their age'. Arguably this 
<BR>
is not just rigid prejudice and lack of imagination; perhaps it reflects a 
<BR>
folk psychological understanding that we, as mimetic critters par 
<BR>
excellence, are prey to misguided longings that do us and the community no 
<BR>
good at all to give in to.
<BR>
<P>Now all this changes, naturally, once we really *do* find ways to extend 
<BR>
health and vigour into the decades of `old age'. If we learn to correct 
<BR>
senescence failures and maintain ourselves in good youthful health, there 
<BR>
might be no painful or foolish inconsistency between our physical phase and 
<BR>
our wish to `act young'. Or maybe that's not right, either, since some of 
<BR>
these changes actually are emergent, and we'll find all sorts of new 
<BR>
troubling pecularities arising when we have old wine in endlessly new 
<BR>
wineskins.
<BR>
<P>In any event, I wonder if we mightn't find a variety of pathologies 
<BR>
emerging, both individual and social, as complex adaptations to the ancient 
<BR>
fact of ageing suddenly jumps their tracks. And in the meantime, it might 
<BR>
be worth asking if the apparent mean-minded or deluded prejudices against 
<BR>
old people acting as if they were spring chickens is an evolved response to 
<BR>
disruptive behaviours, just as the strictures against incest and 
<BR>
paedophilia, say, seem to arise out of such conflicts. That doesn't mean we 
<BR>
should endorse such evolved responses. But if they exist, and have been 
<BR>
selected as adaptive, we might look more carefully and perhaps charitably 
<BR>
at those who embody them.
<BR>
