<EM>&gt; Damien provide an interesting link to Chris Lawson's
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; Essay on aging and longevity.  Attached is the letter
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; that I sent to Chris regarding this essay (with which
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; I mostly agree).
</EM><BR>
<P>I generally agree with Robert's response to Lawson.
<BR>
<P>Robert, has Lawson responded to your response?  If he has, I wonder if he
<BR>
will include an examination of your view in any future discussions on this
<BR>
issue...  The reason I worry about this is because I often am able to
<BR>
convince people that longer, better lives are possible, but they then do not
<BR>
go on to state this to others.  It's like, &quot;Oh, my arguments are wrong, I'll
<BR>
just remain silent now.&quot;  To me, this is almost the same as supporting the
<BR>
wrong arguments, especially since someone who is unaware of the debate and
<BR>
its resolution will most likely think that the original position held is
<BR>
still held -- that Lawson still believes what he did in that paper (assuming
<BR>
you've changed his mind:).
<BR>
<P>Perhaps what should be done is for our kind -- transhumanist, Extropians,
<BR>
life extensionists -- to make the first strike.  That is what I tried to do
<BR>
in my &quot;What is posthumanism?&quot; several years ago.  (See my site for it.)
<BR>
That is, I tried to answer potential critics in the essay, long before they
<BR>
had a chance to voice their opinions.  People still disagreed, but then my
<BR>
ideas were out there first -- as opposed to my critics'.  I don't know how
<BR>
well this worked, but one thing it did manage to do, at some junctures, was
<BR>
shift the focus of the debate in my direction.  And a silent critic under
<BR>
such circumstances had less power than under the above outlined ones.
