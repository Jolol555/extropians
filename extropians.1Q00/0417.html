<EM>&gt;&gt;The largest study ever done on domestic violence, involving detailed
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;interviews with 23,000 victims revealed that in 70% of the cases, the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;woman instigated the violence.  Typically she would keep escalating until
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;the man responded, at which point the police would be called and the man
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;arrested - about 98% of the time back then (this was three or four years
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;&gt;ago, as i recall).
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt;Have a cite for this study?

<P>I wish I did; if I had I would've used it, natch.  A very large report - 
<BR>
like most of one entire newspaper page - on the study appeared a few years 
<BR>
back in either or both the Orange County Register or the L.A.Times - I 
<BR>
believe both.  I recall that there was also some TV news mention.  I lost 
<BR>
track of my copy of the report unfortunately, but it shouldn't be that hard 
<BR>
to find.
<BR>
<P>There was virtually dead media silence following this, however, which should 
<BR>
not be surprizing.  Recall that when the news broke from the feds re road 
<BR>
rage, one part of the breaking story - I watched the National Traffic Safety 
<BR>
guy relate this live - was that the majority of road rage attacks came from 
<BR>
young women drivers.  I observed at the time that this poor guy suddenly 
<BR>
looked very apprehensive as he stated this conclusion of their study.  I 
<BR>
never heard that part of the information repeated anywhere else, although 
<BR>
every professional driver I've asked has agreed that that matches their 
<BR>
experience, and it certainly matches mine - God knows how many times some 
<BR>
young woman in her huge 4-by has almost run me down on my motorcycle.
<BR>
<P>Bottom line:  it's not politically correct (read economically feasible, when 
<BR>
women account for 85% of consumer purchases in the U.S. and the mass media 
<BR>
caters to the purchasers of advertized products, right?) to label women as 
<BR>
potentially just as violent as men, given opportunity.
