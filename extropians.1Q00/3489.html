<P><EM>&gt; I'm not saying that qualia do or do not exist, but if they do not
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; then it seems reasonable to suggest that there is a mechanism in
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; your brain that fools you into thinking you Experience the world.
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; If such a mechanism were found then it would be evidence against the
</EM><BR>
<EM>&gt; existence of qualia.
</EM><BR>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd be happy if there we even some rational theory of how this
<BR>
could be, let alone some way that it actually is.  This doesn't even
<BR>
seem logically possible to me.  Whatever the representation is, that
<BR>
is our knowledge, whether it is incorrect or not, these
<BR>
representations have phenomenal qualities.  And it is these internal
<BR>
conscious phenomenal qualities of our knowledge that we are talking
<BR>
about.  It's as if one is arguing that there isn't really any
<BR>
representation that is our conscious knowledge, we just consciously
<BR>
know things, and this knowledge is mistaken.  How is saying we don't
<BR>
have qualia, it just seems to us that we do, any different?
