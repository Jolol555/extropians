<a href="0714.html#0718qlink1">&gt; &gt;&gt;The processed images of the Face have produced a wealth of evidence </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;&gt;consistent with artificiality, though the controversy is far from over. </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;ROTFLMAO... I'm not even going to touch this one.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While I have no clue what "ROTFLMAO" stands for ("rolling on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; floor"-something, I guess), I really don't get why this is an "untouchable."  </i><br>
<i>&gt; No one with common sense is saying there are unquestionably alien artifacts </i><br>
<i>&gt; on Mars.  But the possibility is there, and we have the means to _test_ the </i><br>
<i>&gt; Intelligence Hypothesis in the very near future, using proven hardware.</i><br>

<a name="0721qlink1">"...laughing my ass off" is the rest of the acronym.  We're not
ignoring the evidence, there just isn't any.  None.  Zero.</a>  The
<a name="0721qlink2">only thing going on here is that there's a rock on Mars that kinda
looks like a face.  So what?  I have a potato that kinda looks
like Jay Leno.</a>  The originator of this nonsense is Richard Hoagland,
<a name="0721qlink3">who richly deserves the "crackpot" title because he spent years
hawking this as a great discovery and spreading the "experts are
supressing the evidence" meme and other lunacy.</a>  Of course Sagan
called for more research--he'd say anything to beg for more money.
<a name="0721qlink4">But even he didn't take it seriously.</a>

<p>
<a name="0721qlink5">We'd all be thrilled with some real evidence of life on Mars, as
I'm sure many of us were with the discovery of polycyclic aromatic
hydrocarbons in that meteorite last year.  /That's/ worth study.</a>
<a name="0721qlink6">A funny shaped rock is just a funny shaped rock.</a>
