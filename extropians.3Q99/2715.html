<a name="2766qlink1">Thanks Brian D. Williams for your analysis.  Mine is similar, not that I am 
<br>
'afraid of roundup', or against genetic engineering.  Your point is well <br>
taken, these seem to benefit  big agribiz  most, and consumers secondarily.   
 While I thank Robert J. Bradbury for looking up the LD50 of Roundup, this 
misses my point.  It is not necessarily just  the roundup, but the 
opportunity to build in plant resistance to all of these chemicals, but 
ignoring the human resistance to the chemicals.  Just because so many mg/kg 
kills half the rats, does not mean that lower doses are safe for humans.  The 
EPA is finding with many biocides, that for example children are much more 
succeptable to harmful effects, or that low doses do not kill by direct 
toxicicty, but some compounds act as hormones at very low levels causing 
endocrine disruption.  A simplistic LD50 analysis ignores interactions among 
dozens of chemical adulterants in our diet.  Often as with agent orange,</a> it 
is not the main compound which is ultra bad, but by products from the organic 
synthesis (dioxins) in minute quantities that are worse than the main 
product.  The issue is complex I agree, and I have a BS in chemistry, so I am 
no chemophobe.   But in the interest of life extension, less chemicals in the 
diet that my species has not had time to evolve with is better, at least this 
is a cautious approach. 

<p>
  So, yes, we should support accurate labling, so consumers have free choice, 
we should have more biotech research on humans  to reisist cancer and other 
chemical degredation.  Monsanto and its share holders are second to the 
health of the population [and me].
