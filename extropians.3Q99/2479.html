I'll explain thought control here but I was wondering if you would mind 
explaining some of your experiences of consciousness with me.  I'm going to 
build the worlds first computer that'll allow a person to link to a virtual 
world, a world that will still allow you to communicate with the real world 
(I described above as the outside world).  I allready have plans on how I'm 
going to do it.  I just need to learn more about computer hardware and brain 
hardware.  I believe my logic has allready figured out the rest.  Any 
insight you can give me about consciousness would be most benificial.  If 
there is any error in my logic I need to know now.

<p>
An on-line discussion would be most benificial to me so I've printed my 
response here, but if you would prefure an off-line discussion then I'm ok 
with that too.  Just reply to clintodell@hotmail.com

<i>&gt;Are you claiming this [creating a thought] to be a conscious process?</i><br>

<p>
Thoughts are both conscious and unconscious processes.  Because the brain is 
allways matching memory patterns, and since memory is distributed throughout 
the brain, and one part of it being echoic memory (where thoughts are 
comprehended as language) then obvously you can't have complete control 
there.  Thoughts will just pop in your head as parts of memory are read and 
distributed.

<p>
A thought is also stored in memory since self awareness is the recognition 
of the pattern that you are making all the decisions.  Of course the brain 
can read that part of memory and its associations, and be so complex that 
there isn't just one course of action, or there are to many associations to 
be distributed and processed at the same time.  It's like trying to pass 64 
bits each via a 4 bit bus between 7 circuits at the same time.

<p>
My mind is running a thousand miles an hour right now and I can't keep me 
thoughts on track.  My thoughts are just all over the place! I need to lie 
down.  I went ahead and printed this anyways so you can start thinking about 
it.  I'll finish it up when my head stops hurting.
