At Extro4, Dr. Gregory Stock gave a pitch on the effect of
cash prizes on research.  [Extropians has a great collection of
Gregs: Stock, Bear, Burch, and jones, just to name 4].  We
have an outstanding datum for this topic, found at the URL

<p>
 <a href="http://entropia.com/ips/stats.html">http://entropia.com/ips/stats.html</a>

<p>
This is the GIMPS project, or Great Internet Mersenne
Prime Search, which uses your spare CPU cycles (behind screen savers)
to search for Mersenne primes.  I have had my computers working
on for a little over a year.  The URL shows the amount of
computing time in the effort as a function of time, since the
inception.  The project's CPU time fits a parabolic curve.

<p>
Nowthen, you will notice a dip in the curve starting at about
1 April 1999.  There had been a $1500 token award for the next
Mersenne to be found [they were found at a rate of approximately
1 every year].  The project was moving along smoothly, picking
up participants and faster computers all along, until 1 April, 1999
when two things were announced.  On that day, the project's software
author announced that he had found a bug in the code which
invalidated much the results of the previous several months.  Secondly,
on that day the EFF [Electronic Frontier Foundation] announced
a 50,000 dollar prize for the first million digit prime, which would
most likely be the next prime discovered by GIMPS.

<p>
I and most others assumed both were April Fools jokes, but, as
it turns out, both were true.  It was a pure Stephenson-esque
coincidence that they both happened on April 1.  The bug required
downloading a new version, and all results turned in under the old
version after 1 April were awarded zero credit on the chart.
This explains the dip in the growth history curve.  It is in a way most
unfortunate that the award and the bug coincided, for this prevents
us from studying their effects on group participation separately.

<p>
If any of you follow IdeasFutures, you may have seen a meme in
which some yahoo proposed that a two million digit prime would
be discovered before 1-1-2000.  This meme was recently retired in the
affirmative, as a GIMPS participant (happily, it was a young newlywed)
discovered the 38th known Mersenne prime on June 1.  He and
his young bride are 50k richer.  Turns out, I was the yahoo that proposed
the 2E6Pri meme on IdeasFutures.  (If you are interested I will share
the mathematics of how I calculated that a two million digit prime
would probably show up before 1-1-2000.)

<p>
<a name="1823qlink1">In conclusion, I make this offer: if Extropians wish to form a
GIMPS team, I will donate all my currently held CPU time, which
is about 3.4 CPU years.  The EFF prize for the first ten million digit
prime is $100,000, which if we should win, I propose we donate
to extropians.org.</a>

<p>
Note, I do not wish to compete for spare CPU
cycles with the extropian SETI@home team, but I know several
extropians have expressed disdain for SETI@home.  Perhaps if
some of these individuals do not have a similar disdain for
mathematics, they would wish to take me up on my offer of
3.4 CPU years as a seed for an extropians GIMPS team.

<p>
Mathematically yours, spike
