Hello everyone,

<p>
I have been fascinated again by the thoughts put forth on how females choose 
their mating partners whether for short or long-term.  I find the Mr. buns 
vrs. Mr. brains argument intriguing though like some have said I think what 
woman want and what the attractive and intelligent women get is a man with 
both qualities!!!  I know for this as a a fact having heard the want from 
"alpha female" of having "alpha males" who in both ways have the right 
stuff.  Many of the true alpha males of course want to play the field and 
not settle down!  And so I hang around alpha females who will date me but 
not commit while they whine about not having "full access" to an alpha male. 
  Women have really caught on now more then ever that brains combined with 
some ambition make for a man who can make life more pleasant for them.  Of 
course some females (and males) are forced by their own limitations to 
settle for 'second best' in terms of brains and/or looks.  The human mating 
game is a cruel one to be sure.  Well, this goes without saying.

<p>
Certainly though a person can do a great deal to make themselves more 
attractive to possible partners by getting a good education, being 
physically fit(so simple but so many are over-weight and out of shape), 
dressing well and having a sense of self and goals.  Of course this is all 
easier said then done and we are still hemmed in by limitations depending on 
who we are and the luck of the genetic dice.

<p>
My bestfriend's father gave me excellent advice years ago that I did not 
appreciate till recently.  He said that women would in their teens and early 
twenties go for the charming and handsome jerks but at least some of the 
women would wise up and see that a good man with a decent job was more 
important then being with a charming rogue who would eventually wipe their 
feet on them.  Of course some women never learn but neither do some men.

<p>
He said that I just needed to set goals and be headed in the right direction 
in a way that women could see I was headed somewhere good and that would 
attract them.  The analogy is that of "not rocking the boat" for women but 
instead staying on course for your goals and letting the quality women come 
to you.  Just keep your cool man!  But it is easier said then done!

<p>
At age 32 I am only half-way done with my degree and do not always heed my 
own advice.  I find women I am attracted to can really fry my brain and 
heart.  I just crave the companionship and love of a good woman so badly.  
But I do not want to jump into a bad relationship either so I bear the pain 
quietly.  I should have gotten my degree years ago but laziness, learning 
disabilities, a.d.d. and depression helped to prevent it.  I thought why 
bother getting a degree if I have no driver's license due to learning 
disabilities?  Many years have been lost but hopefully my degree, future 
career and marriage will be all the sweeter due to the wait.  I feel the 
time swiftly going by and do not want to hit 40 not having achieved my 
goals.  I want a wife and  children by then.

<p>
Last night I called at a $42.50 cost (expensive for me-calling card) an 
aussie gal I care about who went in for surgery today.  I consoled her and 
tried to cheer her up.  We have been email pals for six months now but the 
romantic bond once there has faded.  I tried over the phone to reconnect 
with her in a moment of fear for her.

<p>
The problem is she is done with her degree and just started teaching.  I 
have a ways to go and I am poor and not a driver even.  She is beautiful, 
smart and educated so when in October she travels to Utah where she would 
like to settle it will be a feeding frenzy for the guys there to try to gain 
her favor.  I want her to visit me and she said she and her female 
travelling companion might but only after they have already been to Utah a 
month.  That is too much time for her to meet another.

<p>
I have two big regrets about her.  One is that I lied to her about my age 
saying I was 25 instead of an 'old' 32!  I know I must level with her but 
have not and that may derail everything.  But I must do it.  And I should 
have phone called her every week starting the first week we 'hit it off' and 
she implored me to call her up!!  A powerful bond could have been forged 
between us by doing by my calling her up once a week but the possible cost 
and my lie kept me from doing it.

<p>
But now I am doing it and I will play this out to the bitter end.  There are 
other women in my life both on the net and in the 'real world' but I had my 
heart set on Becky.  I have had my heart ripped out of my chest and stepped 
on before so I will most likely survive.

<p>
Perhaps this makes me 'unfit' along with my l.d. but my depression hits me 
hard.  I hope when I go back on a brand I think will do the job I will be 
able to gain the joy and strength that I presently lack in my life.

<p>
I wish you all well.  I look forward to any comments anyone might have.  
What I read on this list often thrills my heart and mind.  Take care 
everyone!

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
