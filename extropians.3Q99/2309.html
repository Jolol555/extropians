<p>
Have we explored the reasons why an SI would want to become an SSI; an SSI
an SSSI and so on?


<p>
The major reason I am so focussed on growth at the moment is that I want to
be on the same ontological level as all of my information. I want to be
able to understand and manipulate my own architecture. I want to remove all
these kludgy interfaces. Typing and talking are so inefficient (not to
mention the RSIs such as carpal tunnel syndrome). I want a less volatile
memory. I want morphological freedom. I want to be able to travel in space.
I want to find out if there's anyone else out there to talk to.

<p>
This is the major boundary most of us would like to cross. Once we do this,
we need new reasons to grow. I'm not entirely convinced that I would not
want to stop at some point. I probably would keep on expanding, but I'm not
sure. (I know it doesn't matter. Worry about that when I'm more
intelligent. But it's fun.)

<p>
So, what reasons can we come up with. I can think of a few offhand:

<p>
(1) Need more room for accumulated memories.<br>
 I can see the utility of "forgetting" for sanity/efficiency reasons. We
won't be able nor want to remember *everything*. Storage space for memories
would probably not require *exponential* growth.

<p>
(2) Competitive advantage. [the most convincing reason to me]<br>
There may be no one to compete *with* however.

<p>
(3) Figure out what to do about the "death" of the universe.<br>
So do we stop growing once we figure this out? :-)

<p>
(4) It's simply fun to become more and more intelligent.<br>
Not entirely convincing.

<p>
While I think that it may be diffucult to secure one's immortality without
continual growth, I am looking for more support for this idea.

<p>
The characters of Greg Egan's _Diaspora_ for example, had long since
learned the perils of exponential growth. Does anyone see this as a
plausible scenario, or merely an artificial constraint needed to make the
novel intelligible?
