&gt; Subject: Re: Eliezer is only nineteen years-old!!<br>

<p>
After some discussion on this topic, I'm forced to confront the
fact that it doesn't seem we have any independent verification that
Eliezer is in fact 19.

<p>
He wasn't at the Extro 4 conference to my knowledge and I
haven't seen any letters from someone who hangs out with
him personally (though one would suppose these could be
forged by Eliezer himself posing as someone else).

<p>
I would argue that we need an independent verification, either
by multiple authenticated agents who know him or by a real
"netmeeting" with video (some kind of online Turing test
that would be difficult for him to fake using current
technology).

<p>
No offense intended towards anyone, just a case in point
about the degree to which we are going to have to question
our assumptions *and* beliefs.

<p>
Robert
