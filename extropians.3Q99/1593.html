Buy a good paperback on how to manage large sums of money.</a>

<p>
&gt; $1 Hundred<br>

<p>
Buy a good accounting program to help me manage large sums of money.

<p>
&gt; $1 Thousand<br>

<p>
Book a few air flights to convene with some of the brightest people on the planet about
organizing some key projects involving large sums of money.

<p>
&gt; $1 Million<br>

<p>
Start my own nanotechnology reseach company, invest in my own personal longevity.
Use my position to get to know well the most promising longevity researchers.

<p>
&gt; $1 Billion<br>

<p>
With approzimately $600 Million I would start my own space commercialiation venture.
I would hire the best of the best to design and develope a cheap means of
travel to low earth orbit. Another $200 million would go to the further development
of nanotechnology longevity reseacg as well as complexity design and management
software. Another $196 million would go towards Closed Ecological Support
Systems research. The remaining $4 million would go to hiring the brightest minds
to crack the lightspeed problem - i.e. wormholes, acubierre warp drive,etc.

<p>
&gt; $1 Trillion<br>

<p>
Research, design, build and implement a large scale space infrastructure that could
operate completely independently of earth.  This would include extensive asterioid capture
and resource extraction,  L4 &amp; L5 space colony development, and wide spread zero-g
manufacturing and sci/tech reseach facilities.  I would prefer that all nanotech and AI research be
conducted in space to insulate any accidents that might occur.  At least $5 billion would now be spent
on research to break the lightspeed barrier.

<p>
&gt; $1 Quadrillion<br>

<p>
This kind of buying power should easily allow the achievment of the assembler breakthrough,
and push nanotech research ahead at breathtaking speed.  With this amount of capital
it should become very easy to achieve breakthroughs in uploading, AI, longevity, and
environmental restoration.  Futher investments should allow the majority of humans
to live like millionaires, migrate to space, upload themselves, etc.  Maybe an FTL breakthrough?

<p>
&gt; $1 Pentillion<br>

<p>
Colonize the Galaxy


<p>
&gt; $1 Hexillion<br>

<p>
Use the first of the money to finance the Far-Edge Party.  Spend the rest
of the money on figuring out how to create new universe to escape the
eventual heat death or big crunch of this one.  Upgrade all known entities
to M-Brain status.  Begin to explore the nearest 1000 galaxies.

<p>
&gt; $1 Septillion<br>

<p>
Explore the nearest 1 million galaxies.  Begin Universe creation experiments.


<p>
<a href="1579.html#1593qlink2">&gt; $1 Octillion</a><br>

<p>
Explore the rest of the universe not yet explored.

<p>
&gt; $1 Ninthillion<br>

<p>
Create new universes.

<p>
&gt; $1 Decillion<br>

<p>
Thow a huge 'Welcome to the Omega Point' Party!
