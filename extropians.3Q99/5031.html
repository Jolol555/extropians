<a href="5025.html#5031qlink1">&gt; I wish we could have a formal debate...</a><br>

<p>
I've thought for some time about the nature of present debates, and
why they are useless and not entertaining.  The web offers us a great
opportunity to do better, but we haven't.  As much as I might admire
the motives of Foresight's Crit, Third Voice, and similar products for
web commentary, they are doomed to failure.  A disorganized collection
of repetitive comments from self-selected hotheads will always be
nothing but noise, so readers will turn it off (if not physically then
mentally).  Talk is cheap; /quality/ talk is where it's at, and that
requires human judgment to craft into a product.

<p>
I'd like to see pages where debates on "tough questions" are presented.
But they should be presented as a work authored by the judge/organizer
from contributions by the participants.  Here's how I envision it might
be done:

<p>
The judge selects a topic question worded appropriately.  Opening
statements on either side are solicited, and the judge picks one or
two from each side that are done well.  These people will be the
participants.  The judge selects them based on how well they present
their case, not their passion for it (except insofar as that makes
their presentation good).  The participants read all the opening
statements, the judge makes private commentary to each author about
their quality, and the participants then edit their opening statements
for content based on that input.  The judge then makes final edits
and posts them.

<p>
Now that the opening statements are fixed, the judge solicits points
of argument.  These, too, are selected and edited for quality and
relevance, and then presented for rebuttal.  This continues until the
participants run out of interesting and relevant points of debate in
the judge's opinion (or perhaps when the judge decides that volume
merits narrowing the scope of the debate and starting over).  The
judge then selects and edits the best points and best rebuttals and
publishes them.  Finally, the process for opening statements is
repeated for closing statements, and those are edited and published.

<p>
The web allows a debate to take place over days and even weeks, with
participants taking the time to carefully craft each response and
give the judge time to organize, and still result in an orderly and
artful presentation that takes the customer only minutes to read.
That respects the value of the reader's time and gives em a reason to
read the debate instead of a useless live chat or email flame war.
