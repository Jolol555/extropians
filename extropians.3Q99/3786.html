I whole-heartedly support space exploration; but Shermer's whacking on Tipler 
isn't getting my vote for anything. The Chinese in the 15th century also made 
it impossible to advance for inventing new devices. Hence, if you are a 
farmer-your children will all be. That was Manderin Chinese rule.

<p>
 Here its a matter of priorities. What happended to Nasa's committment to 
Better, Cheaper,Faster or build a little, test a little?  Nasa can screw up 
also-and from what I have heard it has-to the point the the Nasa replacement 
vehicles  that were supposed to be out in a few years? Well the latest 
estimate is that the shuttles might have to be in use till 2040. Excuse me? 

<p>
But I will write my congress-persons anyway..hands off Nasa. As far as 
Shermer goes, its not pretty.
