<p>
There is no doubt that John Stossel is about the best journalist out
there. He is strong, witty, and informative. He has been around since I
was a little girl and as I have grown so has he. He is now the foremost
journalist for what I consider "rational ideas." He isn't afraid to go out
and stand against the proclaimed U.S. majority on just about every issue.
For those of you know of his work, I encourage you to encourage others to
get to know him. If you don't know about Stossel, it is time well spent
just to learn and do what you can to get your hands on his ABC special
<br>
"Junk Science &amp; Are We Scaring Ourselves To Death" They are. excellent.<br>

<p>
With all this said, Stossel is now taking his greatness to the class room.
He will be providing videos and other class room materials for discussions
of his now well known ABCnews specials. If you are interested in
supporting Stossel or just getting to know more about his
new project you can do so at:
