Youve already done it.  I have set the arbitrary lower limit at 5
members.  If we get 5 (you, me and 3 others) I will donate my
accumulated time.  With less than 5 we would just embarrass
ourselves.

<p>
Ja, I was less than satisfied with seti@home.  Wouldnt get outta my
way unless priority was set at the lowest.  Actually I feel SETI is more
worthwhile than the next Mersenne prime, but GIMPS is set up a bit
better than seti@home.  It will not cause your computer to crash,
and, you have the option to defeat the feature that sends results
out automatically, so you neednt worry some yahoo is trying to
secretly infiltrate your disc, etc.  So, Bryan Moss and spike.  Others? spike
