<a name="4623qlink3">People *are* affected by architecture, design and decor,  including smells, 
music... Sensual beings, sensing that entire ambiance of a place. Our 
experience is greatly affected by it "BUT ONLY IF WE ARE ATTUNED TO DELICACY 
OR IMAGERY AND ENVIRONMENT". It is like taking a moment to breathe</a> in the air 
<a name="4623qlink4">of a new city and finding out what it has ti offer.</a> We must be finely tuned 
to use it.  It is a learned skill, and a valued one, IMO. It requires a 
stepping outside of one's own ego and personal experience for a moment and 
saying "what affects me here" - detached from one's own agenda. It requires a 
love of life and all it offers. i t requires a large focus, liek blurring 
your eyes when you look at neon lights. It is availble if we look for it, but 
it does not appear  - not for the singleminded.

I loved the original post (I have seen the images, not the actual venues) 
because it touched on something that Fascinates Me. 

<p>
When i first heard of the Exi list, I imagined a forum where playful, highly 
tuned visionaries threw out ideas - images(being an artist i visualized it 
that way).I had seen the magazine and it was very visual. It also had a lot 
of words - but even the words invited "visions" of the future.  I thought of 
unlimited people playfully inventing hyroponics gardens in the air, emerald 
islands of nano, huge utopian offworld colonies, implants, neuromancer jacked 
in environments, genetic engineering feats, the end of labor, rockets, 
landfills, floating cities, etc etc.
 
<p>
brainstorming...

<a name="4623qlink5">What I am encountering instead ( to my great aMUSEment) is dour</a> resistance to 
<a name="4623qlink6">"play" - some critical critical can I say it again critical.....nay saying 
festivities.

Look,  N's post was fun! It was ticklish! It was EVOCATIVE... To me, it made 
me want to know more -- want to find out what it was about her that simplw 
photos of places, gaev rise to  images -- that made her brain tick! Made her 
want to share them to our little cyber culture! It struck me that it might be 
 ambience, or moodand  environment that simply reminded us "what are we doing 
to make our place in the world a part of the visions we seek to portray!!!

<p>
 Possible tools for recreating our live-spaces:
Lighting, color, texture, cast metals, lovely people, beads, elevators, 
curves, anilmals, screens, smells, stairs, music, large space, dancers, fuzzy 
materials, levels, images, projection, holos... etc...  ...sigh.... 
incredible...
