<a href="2985.html#3044qlink1">&gt;Baha'i started as an offshoot of Islam, not of Christianity.  It is now </a><br>
<i>&gt;considered</i><br>
<i>&gt;a distinct religion, not a sect.  There are two things I love about the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Baha'i that are</i><br>
<i>&gt;largely absent from other religions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;First, they believe that God has appeared to Man many times.  Each time, he </i><br>
<i>&gt;appears</i><br>
<i>&gt;with a message appropriate to the time and place.  Naturally, they think he </i><br>
<i>&gt;most</i><br>
<i>&gt;recently appeared to their founder.  But they are very tolerant of other </i><br>
<i>&gt;religions, since</i><br>
<i>&gt;they believe that Islam, Judaism, Christianity, Hinduism, etc. all are </i><br>
<i>&gt;following the Word</i><br>
<i>&gt;of God -- just an outdated version.  None of the all-too-common "kill the </i><br>
<i>&gt;infidel" or "you</i><br>
<i>&gt;will burn in hell if you don't believe what we do" that you see in other </i><br>
<i>&gt;groups.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Second -- perhaps because it was formed during the Age of Science -- they </i><br>
<i>&gt;believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;that when scientific discoveries conflict with religious teachings, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;teachings should</i><br>
<i>&gt;be discarded in favor of what science has found.  Where some religions feel </i><br>
<i>&gt;that</i><br>
<i>&gt;their holy books are the literal word of God, they believe that their books </i><br>
<i>&gt;are a fallible</i><br>
<i>&gt;human's best attempt to write down what God said.  But science is observing </i><br>
<i>&gt;God's</i><br>
<i>&gt;work directly.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Add that their religion was founded a few decades after The Origin of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Species</i><br>
<i>&gt;was published. It seems a safe guess that the Baha'i are emphatically </i><br>
<i>&gt;pro-evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<a name="3102qlink1"><a name="3067qlink1">Do you know anything about Unitarianism?  I met a woman last night</a> who 
claimed to be one.<a name="3053qlink1">  It was the first I've ever heard of it.  Apparently they 
believe that people can believe what ever they want.</a>  The have a church, 
minister, everything.  What I can't understand is if you can believe 
whatever you want then what are they worshipping?  I understand there are 
atheists as well as theists in this religion, if you can even call it that.

<p>
Also is this related in any way to Baha'i?
