<a name="4295qlink1">I meant to mention this to you--do you realize that you are expressing
Taoist sentiments quite regularly?  One example below:</a>

<p>
In applied Taoism, many teachers say that you must first accept yourself
and all around you, and then be prepared to let it go, because you must
then accept the flow of things, the ever-changing.  "The Master observes
the world but trusts his inner vision.  He allows things to come and go.
His heart is as open as the sky."

<p>
And, at the same time, if you have developed a strong center, you yourself
do not become lost in that change.  "We join spokes together in a wheel,
but it is the center hole that makes the wagon move.  We shape clay into a
pot, but it is the emptiness inside that holds whatever we want"

<p>
Just a thought for the day....
