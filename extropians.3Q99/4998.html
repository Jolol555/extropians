Really, this is basic common sense.  I think most people will come to
adopt something similar to this as they become mature, based on problems
that arise in being excessively blunt.

<p>
Most societies have conventions of politeness which have evolved over
many generations.  Given the inherent differences and incompatibilties
among people, politeness is the social lubricant that allows people to
get along with the minimum of friction.  It saves wasted time in trying
to correct misunderstandings and deal with disputes and resentments.

to impose costs which could have been avoided.
