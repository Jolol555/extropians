My pessimism in response to Anders' post was based on the scenario's 
assumption that it was very difficult to determine who had been infected and 
the widespread belief that many people had been infected.  In this situation, 
I don't know how any NON-INFECTED person could trust the existing 
constitutional mechanism of succesion.
