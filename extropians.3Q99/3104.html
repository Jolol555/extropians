It seems that we have been having that debate for quite awhile
now.  It's been going something like this:

<p>
ANDERS, in lilting tones:  There is this wonderful new proposed
technology, [insert name of technology].  With this new technology,
we could make our brains bigger and think more thoughts.  We
could cure disease.  We could upload!  See, I have some calculations.

<p>
NICK, with steady gaze:  This new proposed technology can be
used to blow up the planet.  It can melt your brain.  See, I
have calculations.

<p>
KATHRYN:  You both have good points here.  I'd like to see a
working prototype!  Does this thing really work?  Let's do science,
not science fiction....

<p>
ANDERS:  The really stubborn people come from Nick's part</a> of
Sweden.

<p>
NICK:  Let's write a paper.
