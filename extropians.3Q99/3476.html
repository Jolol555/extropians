Faced with a question such as, for example, "Can the mind override
genetic tendencies?" or "Does a Specialist count as a transhuman?", I
find it useful to divide "the stuff that people are made of" into three layers:

<p>
Panhuman
<br>
Gaussian
<br>
Personal

<p>
The panhuman layer includes all complex functional adaptations - called
"panhuman" for the reason that you can't get a complex adaptation
without it evolving from a simple adaptation, which requires that the
simple adaptation be reliably present in the population over
evolutionary time.  For the visual cortex to evolve there had to be a
retina, for example.  Thus every complex adaptation I've heard of is panhuman.

<p>
The Gaussian layer refers to things like levels of particular cognitive
abilities, height, weight, and other characteristics that - in
"gaussian" or unaltered humans - tend to be distributed in a gaussian
curve.  If the defining quality of the panhuman layer is genetically
stored complexity, the defining quality of the gaussian layer is
quantitative variation.  (Terminology confusion warning:  Altered humans
can have "trans-gaussian" levels of a "gaussian-layer" characteristic.)

<p>
The Personal layer refers to constructs which can be composed in complex
and extremely variant ways.  I would say "arbitrary", except that the
contents of the Personal layer do have to be constructed of human
components.  We might compare the Personal layer to shapes made of
Legos; they have to be made of Legos, but they can be put together in
arbitrary ways.  Personal philosophies, for example, are generally
personal, as are most beliefs and convictions except those produced
directly by instinct and emotion.  The defining quality of the Personal
layer is complex structures with variance on the component level - that
is, while components and the set of interactions may be predefined, the
total structure of interactions is not.

<p>
So in the discussion below, the question is:  Can the Personal layer
override the genetic variance in the Gaussian layer?  And the answer is:
 "Yes, usually, for mental characteristics, although there are limits to
how much farther along the curve you can push them."

<p>
Similarly, to the question of "Is Eliezer Yudkowsky a transhuman?", we
can answer:
<br>
Panhuman layer:  Definitely not.
<br>
Gaussian layer:  Slightly (some abilities a bit off the curve).

<p>
What does it mean to be transhuman on a Personal layer?  Not a lot.  But
if I had to define something, one effect of being a Personal transhuman
would be possessing personal structures which can be translated into
nonhuman minds; for example, an AI, or an alien.  The actual definition
would be having Personal structures which converge to the truth (which
is presumably the same for all minds) rather than being dependent on
initial conditions (in those cases where a "truth" exists, of course). 
Obviously you don't have to have even slightly transhuman complexity or
abilities to have a transhuman personality, so this is something of an
abuse of the term.  But if we did ask the question on those terms:

<p>
Personal layer:  Quite a bit (50% human).
