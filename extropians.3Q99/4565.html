&gt;&gt;Overall, the theme of the 90s seems to have been retro. <br>

&gt; Some fashion designers, particularly in Tokyo, are doing clothing that
changes the &gt;human shape into something geometric, but it hasn't seemed to
gotten off the &gt;runway yet.  I'd personally like to see that take off,
because we have already had &gt;several centuries of the same basic human body
form.

Most of the fashion and gadgets are same same.  Not much happening, really.
 What is new is the types of fabric and collection of types of fabrics and
metals.  Changing the human shape geometrically is Appropriation Art
because the Bauhaus period did it really well early on.  I think most of
fashion will not change vastly until we alter the body physically.

<p>
Regardless, I still enjoy watching VHI and the fashion shows because they
are fascinating events and the cloths are simply gorgeous and sensual.
