Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND. Adequate qualitative and quantitative food
  intake is a major determinant of health. However,
  nutritional requirements in the elderly are unknown, and even more so in the
  frail elderly. The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of energy
  and macro-nutrients on health in the frail nursing home elderly. METHODS.
  Food intake of 72 not severely diseased
  elderly patients was assessed with direct weighing method. Outcome measure
  was survival over 28-month follow-up period. Confounders of the association
  of food intake with survival were: age,
  gender, body-mass index, daily function, somatic health, anergy, and
  nutritional status. Crude association of food
  intake with survival was assessed with Kaplan-Meyer method,
  and adjusted association with multiple Cox regression models. RESULTS.
  Patients of the study had good average food
  intake. Mortality rate was relatively low
  (.20 per year). Low levels of energy, protein, lipid, and carbohydrate
  intake were negatively associated with survival even after
  adjustment for confounders. When compared to high intake,
  adjusted relative risks for mortality of low
  intake were 4.74, 3.75, 4.71, and 2.04, respectively. Medium
  levels of energy, protein, and lipid, but not carbohydrate,
  intake yielded intermediate mortality risk.
  CONCLUSIONS. Food intake is a strong
<br>
  predictor of survival even in moderately diseased elderly patients,
  suggesting possible low-cost interventions.
