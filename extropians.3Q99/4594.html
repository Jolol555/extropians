<p>
I have taken part in experiments where one puts one or another part of the
brain system offline by introducing a sleep inducing agent into an artery
leading up into the brain.  (Actually one puts the whole brain into sleep
mode for some time, but the parts of interest wake up much faster.) Those
kinds of experiments give a quite.. unique view of one's wetware components.

<p>
One should avoid these kinds of experiments without proper medical support
as we currently do not enjoy brain backup systems.

<p>
These experiments gave more validity to the idea of introducing a new
cybernetic brain unit into the system.  Cyborgs have more fun. :-)
