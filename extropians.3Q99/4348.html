Could we please dispel a particular myth about rape--the idea that one must<a name="4375qlink1"> be aroused in some fashion for it to take place.  In actual</a> medical fact, the stress and fear involved in a forcible situation can cause the genitalia, whether male or female, to go through arousal changes.  This does not mean that the individual is actually aroused, but that the biology is trying to protect itself from the serious damage that could occur.  Most rape crisis centers have factual medical materials available that dicusses this in more detail.

Urgh, I don't usually get into this sort of thing, but I also think that we need to base our discussions on scientific facts when those scientific facts are available.
