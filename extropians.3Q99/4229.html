As a person who lives about 30 miles from Springfield, I cannot be
happier. While I am as pro-science as anybody, the Stellafane people are
mostly out of staters trying to inject their unwanted two cents into
local politics (and Vermonters have gotten sick and tired of
carpetbaggers), and with total disregard for the local economic
situation. Springfield is one of the most depressed areas of Vermont,
and has been that way since the collapse of the US machine tools
industry 20 years ago. There are plenty of better sites in Vermont and
New Hampshire to view the sky from. I suggest they contact the Astronomy
Dept. at Dartmouth College in nearby Hanover, NH for help in locating a
new site. I know, for instance, that the college owns a whole township
in the northern tip of New Hampshire that they just use for student and
alumni camping and logging to support native american scholarships. I
have a hunting cabin about 30 yards outside their township (Called the
Second College Grant) and can vouch for the outstanding quality of the
night sky there. For access to 'The Grant', you can contact Earl Jette
at the Dartmouth Outing Club in Hanover, as the DOC controls
recreational access...
