It might work.  You still have the problem that human participants are
subject to physical arrest and punishment, but that might not be a big issue
as long as you don't do anything that really irritates the major powers.  If
you prefer an extremely weak state, I can see the idea having some
attraction.  Unfortunately, it still leaves your physical body at the mercy
of whatever country you happen to live in.

<a href="2817.html#2880qlink6">&gt; In fact, mightn't you be able to find real countries which would allow you</a><br>

<p>
Doubtful.  Maybe some small island nation - but their Internet connectivity
generally sucks, and it is subject to being cut by whatever neighboring
country their land lines run through.  The more radical you want to be about
independance from prevailing social norms, the more of a problem that is
going to be.

<p>
&gt; How about servers on boats in the deep sea.<br>

<p>
Nope.  That counts as the territory of whatever nation the ship is flagged
under (and if you aren't flagged, they have rules for that too).  AFAIK,
there is no way to avoid being legally under some state's jurisdiction no
matter where you go.

<p>
&gt; Or on a satelite?<br>

<p>
Same deal.

<p>
&gt; Or on the moon?<br>

<p>
Maybe - but it will probably get claimed by the U.N. The only reliable way
to gain independance is to go far enough away that no one really cares about
whatever rock you set down on.  The asteroid belt would do, and so would
anyplace in the outer solar system.  Mars and Venus are a little iffy - they
will probably get claimed by someone before we can get there.
