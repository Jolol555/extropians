For what it's worth, here's my history: As a child I enjoyed spending lots of 
time by myself, either reading or "playing" (which usually involved using 
some toy or other as a prompt for elaborate space opera fantasies starring 
yours truly).  But I also always had at least a few fairly close friends with 
whom I enjoyed often outrageously dangerous physical play, usually initiated 
by me (for instance, the episode that nearly gave my mother a heart attack 
when I was about nine years old, when she discovered that I was conducting 
"flying lessons" for the neighborhood kids by teaching them the trick I had 
learned about how you could jump off the roof of our garage and land on the 
ground with a roll, suffering only relatively minor orthopedic damage).  In 
high school I was a "cross-clique" kid, with social relationships among both 
the "popular" kids and many of the "fringe" groups.  I think that I 
discovered around the age of 13 or so that I could travel in just about any 
social circle if I offered some "value" to each one: A special skill, a set 
of interesting social cross-connections or just specialized knowledge.  I 
guess I must have understood "comparative advantage" even at that young age.
