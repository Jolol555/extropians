Perhaps I should have said difficult, unlikely or expensive.  To
talk about moving photons around is one thing (and I agree is readily
done).  To talk about moving mass around (via E=mc^2) is entirely
another thing.

<a name="3115qlink1">Quoting the Physics of Star Trek, Chapter 5, pg 83:
 "Or, to put it *less* negatively, building a transporter would require
  us to heat matter to a temperature a million times the temperature at
  the center of the sun, expend more energy in a single machine than all
  of humanity presently uses, build telescopes larger than the size of
  the Earth, improve present computers by a factor of 1000 billion billion,
  and avoid the laws of quantum mechanics".</a>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
While I appreciate the stories, I believe warp drive leads to time
paradoxes.  Recent work in time paradoxes I believe has shown them
to be impossible.  [I don't claim to understand this, since to me
it is *all* magic physics.]  At any rate, if Hawking is to solve
the problem of warp drive he may very well face the problem of
solving time paradoxes as well.  I would not spend a lot of time
considering this reality for one simple reason --
  If FTL travel is "effectively" possible, and other life forms
  can evolve, then there is no reason we should still see stars.
  [Other species would have colonized/consumed all energy resources.]

<p>
  So either -- (a) FTL travel is not possible; (b) the evolution of
  technological extraterrestrial civilizations is not possible.

<p>
I would place my bets on (a).
