<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) A lot of the UFO "sightings" bear a remarkable similarity to holographic</i><br>
<i>&gt; projections.  What kind of real, solid spaceship, no matter (a pun, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; suppose) how advanced, can change velocity virtually instantaneously without</i><br>
<i>&gt; at least a massive shock wave - sonic boom, etc.?  Why would they fly that</i><br>
<i>&gt; way?  On the other hand, suppose you spotted a primitive intelligence at</i><br>
<i>&gt; radio stage and decided to spend a little cash letting them know you were</i><br>
<i>&gt; there.  Perhaps the saucers, etc., are in fact very long range holographic</i><br>
<i>&gt; projections.  I can very easilly fool a naive observer that I have an FTL</i><br>
<i>&gt; just by swinging a beam across a wide enough arc.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0320qlink1">When 'liewitnesses' claim sudden changes in direction, they are using</a> their own
<a name="0320qlink2">stationary reference. Anyone experienced in air operations</a> of tactical military
<a name="0320qlink3">or other high performance aerobatic aircraft know that this perception</a> is false,
<a name="0320qlink4">because the people are ignoring changes in distance. To the observer,</a> a vehicle
<a name="0320qlink5">travelling across one's field of view will seem to come to a rapid stop and
hover, then zoom off in another direction, when in actuality they</a> are conducting
<a name="0320qlink6">a turn where the midpoint of the turn is when the plane is either</a> moving toward
or away from the observer, so it just seems to hover.<a name="0292qlink1"> Whenever I hear of a UFO
<a name="0320qlink7">report that includes 'rapid changes in direction', I know what</a> is actually going
<a name="0320qlink8">on, and that the eyewitness is ignorant of flight dynamics, and lacks</a> an ability
<a name="0320qlink9">to think in three dimensions. Note that people have poor depth perception at
long range.</a></a>

<a href="0273.html#0288qlink2">&gt; 2) The abductions, however, can more easilly be explained another way</a><br>
<i>&gt; entirely.  You are familiar with roofies - rohypnol, and the other</i><br>
<i>&gt; "date-rape" drugs.  The CIA did several decades worth of research on mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; control using selective memory erasing drugs, starting immediately after</i><br>
<i>&gt; WWII and possibly (very likely) still continuing.  In some S. American</i><br>
<i>&gt; countries, kidnappers routinely use native scopalomine to kidnap the wealthy</i><br>
<i>&gt; and steal them blind.  I suggest that to whatever extent these are not mere</i><br>
<i>&gt; fantasies or publicity stunts, they are probably along the same lines.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; Orange County Register once reported that 40,000 people in Orange County</i><br>
<i>&gt; alone claimed to have been abducted by aliens.  That seems outrageously</i><br>
<i>&gt; high, but even 1% of that would make one wonder if some of them were not</i><br>
<i>&gt; telling a true story of what they thought they remembered, given that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology does exist to achieve that result.</i><br>

<p>
I did an analysis once that showed that if the percentage claiming abduction
really were being physically abducted, then the 'aliens' would have to have a
worldwide fleet of over 1000 vehicles at several dozen bases operating 24 hours
a day, with a logistical sytem of over 100,000 aliens living on the planet to
support air operations. I highly doubt that such an infrastructure could hide
itself that well for that long.
