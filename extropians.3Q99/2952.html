I haven't read this book, but out of curiosity I checked and it is
available from Amazon for $20.27 (plus shipping).  I am very skeptical
that Tom Brokaw has called for the book to be banned; where did you hear
this, Mike?  There have been a number of falsely attributed statements
circulated by the right wing (Janet Reno claiming that Christians are
cult members, etc.).  This sounds like more of the same.

As I mentioned the other day when you buy from Amazon, you can get
them to make a donation to Foresight Institute if you start from:
