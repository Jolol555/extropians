Robert J. Bradbury, &lt;bradbury@www.aeiveos.com&gt;, writes, quoting Hal:
<br>
<a href="1449.html#1563qlink1">&gt; &gt; As noted, this is consistent with John's statement, as absence of</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interaction does not count as a "hit".  The alpha particle would then</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hit another cell.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I suspect this is a semantic problem.  In physical terms, a "hit" is</i><br>
<i>&gt; an interaction with any atom.  The way John (or Hal?) seem to be using</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is to imply a "hit" is *only* an interaction that kills or mutates</i><br>
<i>&gt; a cell.</i><br>

<p>
No, I think there is a pretty well defined notion of what a hit means
in this context, particularly when dealing with a neutrino.  It passes
completely through most atoms, then at some point it interacts with one
and deposits its energy.  The question at hand is whether this energy
will kill the cell.

<p>
<a href="1449.html#1563qlink2">&gt; Since the killing/mutating potential/probability varies with</a><br>
<i>&gt; the energy/LET of the radiation/particle in my book this is overloading</i><br>
<i>&gt; the term "hit".  This is especially true if "hits" that do not kill</i><br>
<i>&gt; or mutate the cell cause damage that causes an immune system reaction</i><br>
<i>&gt; that produces free radicals that later produce mutations or cell death.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The question is *what* is hit and how sensitive is your body to that?</i><br>
<i>&gt; A "hit" to a lipid molecule might produce lipid peroxidation that will</i><br>
<i>&gt; eventually go away (as the lipids get recycled).  A "hit" to a protein</i><br>
<i>&gt; molecule that causes mutations that are "seen" by the immune system</i><br>
<i>&gt; can have cascading effects.  A "hit" to a DNA moleucle (in the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; place) can cause mutations that lead to cancer or cell death.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1568qlink1">The neutrinos from supernova 1987A had energy 5 to 40 MeV.  This is
about 4 x 10^-5 ergs, or about 10^-7 calories.  If this is deposited in a
cell of size about 10 microns, the cell volume will be about 10^-9 cm^3.
Depositing 10^-7 calories in 10^-9 g of water will raise its temperature
by 100 degrees Celcius.</a>

<p>
Granted the energy will need to go through a number of steps to be
thermalized, but this still gives a good indication of the size of
the interaction we are talking about here.  Assuming these figures
are corect, it would be like a tiny bomb going off in the cell, with
enough energy to raise the entire cell to the boiling point of water.
It is hard to see how it could survive a deposit of this much energy.
