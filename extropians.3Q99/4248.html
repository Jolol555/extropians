<p>
Absolutely! Why aren't teachers entitled to defend themselves
against violent students?

<p>

<a href="3995.html#4248qlink2">&gt;them so they can take out their aggressions with lethal weapons</a><br>
<i>&gt;instead of the more common fists?</i><br>

<p>
For a start, lets have a firearms safety course as part of the
curriculum, and a (supervised) rifle &amp; pistol marksmanship club
as an after-school activity.

<p>
On from there, lets have a civics class that teaches when use of
deadly force in self-defense is permissible and when it's not.

<p>
Next step:  Anyone of 16 years who has passed all the
gun-education courses and demonstrates good enough marksmanship
that he isn't a danger to innocent bystanders (and doesn't have a
violent criminal history, mental illness, etc.)  gets a concealed
carry permit, good inside and outside school property.

<i>&gt;slap the other persons face with a glove and then cross foils</i><br>
<i>&gt;after class....</i><br>

<p>
If both parties are willing, I have no objection.  But the
concealed carry permit is for the non-violent student who needs
to defend himself against an aggressive and violent troublemaker
(or more than one), when no "authority figures" are around to
protect him (or her).
