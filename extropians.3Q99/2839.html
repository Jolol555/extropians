<p>
It is really a bad news the recent acts of Kansas Gov. about the prohibition
of teaching Evolution and even Big Bang in public schools. The
sub-inteligent creationists give to inteligent world one more proof of the
danger of the archaic Democratic System. Inefficient actuation of last
<br>
(world) governments has lead mankind to increasing political power of<br>
Ignorant(*) groups, having as consequence the domination of incompetent
and/or opportunist philosophies in the political environment, with bad
cansequences to the society as a whole. The increasing political power of
religious groups, in particular, as "a wolf (donkey) in sheep's clothing",
will lead mankind to a new Dark Age, as it was Catholical Church influence
<br>
(domination...) in Medium Age...<br>

<p>
(*)Notice that Ignorance added to Emotional Insecurity in "riches", and Bad<br>
Social Welfare in "poors",  complete the favorable conditions to proliferate
religion and other existencial distorsions...
