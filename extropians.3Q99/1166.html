It would, and I reeeeeally wish they'd consider the PR ramifications of
using the I-word in their materials!</a>

  <li>  Who knows how many scientists are alienated from our movement because
to them *immortality* is a quack buzz word.

  <li>  If the universe's lifespan is indeed finite, then immortality is not
possible. Ways of preventing such a death are sheer speculation on par
with time travel and FTL-- ie, interesting, but not to base RL decisions
on. More accurate is "indefinite lifespan". Much like redwoods and IBM
PS/2's.

  <li>  The public is so ingrained with the idea of a &lt;70 yr lifespan that
their eyes will simply glaze over when they hear the I-word, and anything
else you say will not register with them.

  <li>  Immortality is a very loud word. It broadcasts our plans loud and clear
to all the right-wing godheads and the left-wing luddites. We don't want
the villagers kicking down Dr. Frankenstein's door before he even has a
chance to unleash his experiment!

The above is meant as constructive criticism. I'm all for ExI, when I have
the cash for a full-body contract, I'll send it to Alcor. So, don't get me
wrong here.

<p>
<a href="1151.html#1166qlink2">&gt; that claims to "boost/support the immune system", "melt fat",</a><br>

<p>
increase energy = too close to casual phrase that could be found in other
<p>
		  contexts.

<p>
chiropractic	= has that been debunked? Any refs?

<p>
others 		= good ones; I'll add them to my search scripts

<p>
Perhaps an automated method of quack detection should give certain phrases
weighted scores instead of immediately disqualifying the document
completely. That way, a quack-rating can be generated for any document.
Perhaps using software similar to that paper-grading bot someone mentioned
on one of the lists a while ago.
