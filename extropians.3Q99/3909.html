With all due respect to Eliezer, I don't think so.  He's described a tsunami, 
that's for sure.  But he's not telling us that this is happening NOW or in a 
future so immediate that particular people would be wise to make specific 
life-decisions based on his projections NOW.  What I hear from him and others 
who project a "spike" of some kind or other is either (1) there's not a 
damned thing you can do about it or (2) a call to action by specialists and a 
call to attention by others.  Even the most wildly optimistic (or 
pessimistic, depending on how you look at it) among us aren't projecting such 
a spike for some years yet.

<a name="3925qlink2">someone in our group doesn't know about them, I'll be very, very surprised.  
There are people on this list or involved with ExI or its "extended family" 
who are at most one or two professional connections away from the leading 
edge in every relevant discipline.  Now, to switch metaphors, consider that 
this little "digital campfire" attracts scouts who report back from the 
frontier regularly.  It's also entertaining to tell scary stories</a> around the 
<a name="3925qlink3">campfire, but that's not the same as the kind of hard-boiled analysis</a> you do 
<a name="3925qlink4">in the morning before you hit the trail.</a>
