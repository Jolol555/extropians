You say that you "have little knowledge of the internal workings of NASA" 
but
<br>
make the assertion that "The scientific talent that NASA has is stifled by
beurocratic [sic] red tape."  This sounds like a statement of fact that 
could
<br>
only be based on "knoweldge of the internal workings of NASA."&gt;&gt;


<p>
I will be the first to admit that judgement without complete knowledge can 
<a name="1335qlink1">be dangerous.  I apologize for making such a rash statement, perhaps the 
wording was not well thought out.  I justify my statement by a rule</a> of thumb 
<a name="1335qlink2">that I use.  When in doubt, dont let the government get involved.  I am a 
firm believer that govt agencies are inefficient.  Even if a particular 
agency is productive at a given time I feel that they inevitably become 
detrimental.  If you disagree with this I would be happy to continue via 
private e mail (no need to clutter the list).</a>

Respectfully
