<a name="1768qlink1">Eliezer, what do you mean by:

<p>
<a href="1766.html#1767qlink1">&gt; Even in a</a><br>
<i>&gt; deterministic Universe, there are still causal dependencies between past</i><br>
<i>&gt; and present</i><br>

<p>
That's what I thought a deterministic universe is. One where the present
instant depends on the instant before.</a>

<p>
<a name="1768qlink2">I don't think its the paradox (between thinking I have control and being
controlled by low level processes) that is an illusion. The paradox has an
answer. The feeling of control is an illusion.</a>

<p>
<a name="1776qlink1"><a name="1768qlink3">Paul, if you feel you need to believe in free will, then I would ask you if
it was enough to believe in the possibility</a> of it. I also wonder what
"assortment of things" I shouldn't do because I don't think I have free
will. I think I should do what is right. (It seems like its mostly just a
theoretical or blaming issue. The only practical thing I can think of right
now is whether I argue that I have free will or that I don't have free
will.)</a>

<p>
BTW, here's a good site with "evidence that our notion of free will is an
illusion" - <a href="http://members.aol.com/kiekeben/fwd.html">http://members.aol.com/kiekeben/fwd.html</a>

Huh? Purposes are definitely software but short-term motivations are not?
