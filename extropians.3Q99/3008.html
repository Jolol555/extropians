&gt; Then the third effect would be heat dissipation as a side effect of
</pre>
<br>
<a href="2980.html#3008qlink1">&gt;  our use of nanotech devices, both for manufacturing (and disassembling),</a><br>
<i>&gt;  as well for simply operating our computers, utility fog, and other nifty</i><br>
<i>&gt;  nano devices.  This energy-waste cost would also be present during the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  transition period as we convert from natural elements to manufactured</i><br>
<i>&gt;  devices for the first time.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  However as I noted originally, the energy to waste in this way all</i><br>
<i>&gt;  comes from solar, and should already have been accounted for in my</i><br>
<i>&gt;  first category.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3034qlink1">Good point: You're not "making" "new energy" in the process of using nanotech 
</a>devices.<a name="3034qlink2">  Also, shouldn't the over-all calculation take into account the heat 
"savings" we get from using more efficient industrial and technological 
</a>process?<a name="3034qlink3">  Seems like reducing whatever current effect human technology has on 
the planet's heat budget would have to be offset against heat created by use 
of nanotech . . . of course, that's subject to the same idea contained in the 
first point, i.e. that the Earth's energy system has only one significant 
real input -- solar energy.</a>
