I don't have time to do this subject justice but, for what it's worth, would 
like to quickly post a very brief summary of my personal views on the general 
topic.  In my opinion the basic values and ideas that have been expressed in 
the Extropian Principles as they have evolved over time are MOST consistent 
with a libertarian political philosophy and maximally free markets as a 
<br>
"default" approach to economic issues.  This does not necessarily mean <br>
"Libertarian Party libertarianism" or anarcho-capitalism, although I think <br>
both are by and large very extropic.  As I wrote here at more length a few 
months ago, I think that one can hold libertarian political ideals and also 
be a minarchist in practice.  

<p>
<a name="3226qlink1">I think the Extropian Principles are inconsistent with unchecked central 
state authority or the use of coercion against people and groups who mind 
their own business or to restrict the rights of individuals to make whatever 
contracts they choose to make.</a>  I think that someone who holds extropian 
<a name="3226qlink2">values and ideals should by and large take the stance that people who propose 
a statist solution to a social problem have the burden of showing how that 
proposed solution doesn't do more harm than good by restricting the freedom 
of individuals to carry on their lives as they choose.</a>  But I'm willing to 
listen to a cogently and diplomatically argued case for a statist policy in 
any particular instance.
