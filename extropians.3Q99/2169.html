<p>
Agreed.  It is part of the job of a "competent" medical practicioner to
be aware of this and attempt to educate individuals when that is the case.

<p>
&gt; I think this phrase, informed consent, is too vague to be of much use.<br>

<p>
Well, you have to give "consent", and it is nice to be "informed" about
what you are consenting to.  Obviously, a person receiving treatment can
rarely understand things as well as the person providing treatment (due
to the differences in education &amp; experience).  The goal of the process
however is to provide an individual with enough information that they
can "feel" they are making a correct decision (i.e. they have taken
control of and responsibility for the action).

<p>
<a href="2159.html#2169qlink3">&gt; The other issue you allude to is the extent to which experience shapes</a><br>
<i>&gt; our perceptions. Someone with a sufficiently traumatic past is going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; see danger where it doesn't exist. Is this intelligent? </i><br>

<p>
The danger will always exist, it may have a very low probability however.
It is probably an indicator of intelligence that (a) a person consider
*all* of the possibilities and (b) get the relative probabilities of
those possibilities close to what they typically are in reality.
An intelligent person with a traumatic past will recognize that their
experiences are not reflective of the experiences of the average
person in the population.  I will grant, that knowing this may
not make it any easier to make calm, rational decisions.  Traumatic
events get wired in at very low levels in the brain.
