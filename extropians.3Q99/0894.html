dooooh!

Please ignore my comments on steel for Gina's tower.  I wrote
it late in the night and was going on memory, as my
reference material was at work.  {8-[ 

<p>
Of course, Beryllium is waaaay better than steel for building
Gina's tower.  Be Modulus is a third again higher and density
is less than a quarter of steel.  Is it too late?  or will spike
spend his entire evening reading about how dumb his 
comment was from dozens of extropians?  {8^D  spike
