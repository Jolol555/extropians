<p>
There's something to that, actually, though the connection might
be less direct (not necessarily horny, precisely, but
having-been-horny -- depends on how much sublimation can happen
after infancy, or: Freud vs. quasi-Freud).

<p>
Works for me.

<p>
But wait. Is/are the other "channel[s]" necessarily bad? (And
wouldn't arguing for their badness be misogynistic, "[s]"
notwithstanding?) And does "baseness," or the directly
pleasurable, entail badness -- or non-artistic?

<p>
If science is about giving us direct access to pleasure, might
the success of science mean the elimination of art? Who would
need art with virtual dopamine? (And if "No!", then: Who needs
science, with non-virtual art?) Quaeritur.

P.S. Well: science for life-extension, to be sure -&gt;
