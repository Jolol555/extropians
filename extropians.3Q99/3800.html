<p>
Personally, I'd just as soon tie the perception of physical beauty
directly into my evaluation of the female's intelligence and disable all
checking of physical attributes.  I find it disturbing, even disgusting
to believe that my mind would probably have more trouble</a> empathizing
with Trinity or Ivanova or Buffy if they were ugly and fat.  (Note I say
"my mind" rather than "I", and "believe" rather than "know".)

<p>
In fact, I'd just as soon go in for asex, but doing that without messing
up absolutely everything else will probably take a *lot* more time to
set up.  It probably can't be done in the flesh.

<p>
In short, I'd self-select attributes in accordance with the attributes
and beliefs that determine my moral intuitions.  (The
subjective-morality phrasing is because I know damn well these things
are ultimately irrelevant.)
