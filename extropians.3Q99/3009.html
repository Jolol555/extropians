I suspect it would result in the teaching of *more* evolution, along
with more creationism perhaps.   Right now the U.S. public schools
are teaching so little on origins they might as well Kansas-ize anyway.
Perhaps if all schools were businesses, teachers would be free to teach.
Religious magnet schools would get creationism, science magnet schools
would *really teach* evolution, and let the chips fall where they may.
