<p>
Showing that _you_ can ask the wrong questions doesn't make
your definition of philosophy a good definition of it.

<p>
You have not given any arguments to support your opinion, not
even in your above reaction, so I must assume that you either
have no arguments or are so ashamed of them that you do not
want to share them with us. The reasons for that can be
multitude, but it's very probable that it's because your opinion
about philosophy is just that, an opinion.

<p>
And where can we look up a definitive definition of those
concepts? And how do we know that they are true?

<p>
It might look like hair-splitting ramblings to you, but
without philosophers asking the hard and boring questions,
we'd still be in the middle ages.

<p>
Gallilei and other people critical of the totalitarian
regime of the church were there because of philosophy
(mostly inherited from the old greek and brought to Italy
when the eastern Roman empire fell in 15-something).
