I'm rather late to the discussion going on re. whether or not our universe is 
a simulation, but I've always been drawn to the possibility.  One esoteric 
fact that's fun to consider (if only as an intellectual exercise) is the work 
done by astronomer/computer scientist Jacques Vallee, who has noted that UFO 
<br>
"flaps" come and go in apparent "schedules of reinforcement."  Is this a sign <br>
of _something_ manipulating what we call spacetime, or a sociological 
phenomenon with some decidedly Jungian implications?

<p>
It's possible that we are being ever-so-gently being urged toward Singularity 
by a nonhuman intelligence, which operates through the medium of folklore.  
There's ample evidence to suggest this same process has been going on for a 
very long time.

<p>
I think the options are:

<p>
a.) psychosocial, "collective unconscious"...

<p>
b.) "aliens" from elsewhere in our universe (or multiverse) are perpetuating 
this for unknown reasons...

<p>
c.) these "schedules of reinforcement" arise from something scripted into the 
computational fabric of our universe, and interact with consciousness with 
the blind resolve of physical law...

<p>
A few books that nicely illustrate this concept include Vallee's "Dimensions" 
and "The Invisible College" and "The Eighth Tower" by John Keel.  The chapter 
<br>
<a href="0146.html#3676qlink1">"Theater in the Sky," in Whitley Strieber's "Confirmation," is also provoking.</a><br>

<p>
Please note I'm not talking UFOs, per se, and I don't want to see a good 
thread get bogged down with a lot of "skeptic vs. believer" garbage.
