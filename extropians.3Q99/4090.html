<a href="4051.html#4090qlink1">&gt; &gt; Someone mentioned that it is dangerous.  Was that Elizabeth</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Childs?  How is it dangerous?  Would my sex drive go away?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What if I took *both* male and female hormones simultaneously?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; What if I took estrogen and viagra?  Is there an online study</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; group fooling with these questions?  spike</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you really want to try being a girl, the easiest and safest way is to try</i><br>
<i>&gt; being a transvestite.  I went to a "come as a girl, whether you are one or</i><br>
<i>&gt; not" party a few years ago and was surprised to see one of my hairiest, most</i><br>
<i>&gt; aggressive male friends daintily sipping tea and dishing out the most catty</i><br>
<i>&gt; gossip.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4096qlink1">Why is it that when someone mentions breaking out of current genderbased
 limitations, the best they can think of being more like the other
</a>
set of gender-based limitations?  To hell with "genderless" society;
I want gender differences to /increase/, not decrease.  I want real
diversity, vitality, creativity, freedom.  I want to be a third or
fourth gender.  I want to take plant hormones and insect hormones, not
just female human ones.

<p>
I look at current gender traits much the same way I look at current
government: a part of reality that has to be dealt with until we can
make something better.  So for now I pay my taxes and trim my beard
while working for the day when I can pay my crime insurance and trim
my foliage.
