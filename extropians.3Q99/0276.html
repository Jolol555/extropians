The pilot study cited indeed sounds interesting, since it's at odds with the 
most famous, and, to my knowledge, most thorough, UFO study, carried out by 
the Air Force in the "early days" of the phenomenon.  The AF found (to its 
dismay) that the better the sighting, _the more likely the object in question 
was to be a genuine UFO_.  

<p>
Of course, "UFO" means exactly that--_unidentified_ flying object.  It 
appears to me that some of the posts re this suffer from the gross semantic 
leap that UFO=alien spacecraft.

<p>
Re holograms:  I don't think most UFO sightings are literal holograms, but I 
think this is a good track to take, since they seem to deliberately "tease" 
witnessses with "impossible" aerial stunts.  UFOs employ a sort of 
technological theater.  Jacques Vallee and a few others see this as a 
possible catalyst for human evolution.  I wouldn't be the least bit surprised 
to discover that we are someone else's artificial life experiment, and UFOs 
and similar phenomena are variables thrown into the mix to assist some vast 
psychosocial study.

<p>
It's also interesting that holograms were mentioned, as there is some 
evidence that the U.S. government has used holography to simulate security 
breaches on air bases--using UFO imagery!  My best best is that these were 
psychological tests, but they could certainly be something else entirely...

<p>
As far as physical, uncontestable "proof" is concerned: we've got it, in one 
form or another.  A number of truly strange implants have been removed from 
the bodies of self-claimed "abductees," with no satisfactory explanation for 
their composition.  This doesn't mean aliens made them: it merely means they 
are an unknown, probably representing a technology of some sort.  The 
literature on this is terribly scant, but there's some intelligent stuff out 
there if you dig.  The website "CNI News" (www.cninews.com) is probably the 
best online source for nonsensational UFO claims (they also report on 
technology, physics and space exploration).

<p>
Dr. Allen Hynek co-authored a book on one of the most compelling mass 
sightings in history: "Night Siege: The Hudson Valley UFO Sightings."  I 
think anyone who can walk away from evidence like this (and I've read dozens 
more) and still insist on an ultimately prosaic explanation is irrational.  I 
contend that the UFO phenomenon, whatever it is (and it could be a lot of 
things, or a combination of many things) is a genuine unknown.  And that's 
really all that's certain at this point.  I broached the topic on a 
transhuman mailing list because I thought that it served as a working 
metaphor for many of the technologies we're concerned with, and maybe UFOs, 
far from being resolutely "alien," might actually be telling us something 
constructive about ourselves.

<p>
It's been noted that mathematical models of UFO sighting waves mirror B.F. 
Skinner's scedules of reinforcement.  Do UFOs represent some form of cosmic 
Skinner Box, or a psychic thermostat?  There's no arguing that our beliefs 
about the world (and, thusly our technologies--our means of dealing with the 
world) have been indirectly influenced by UFOs...  From this perspective, of 
course, the question of whether UFOs are physical objects or not becomes 
immaterial, but we're still faced with a potentially rewarding scientific 
payoff.

<p>
Finally, I don't think UFOs (or their apparent occupants) should be taken at 
face value.  The popular notion that alien are here to cross-breed with us, 
for example, seems to be a knee-jerk interpretation fueled by science fiction 
media.  _But that doesn't negate the fact that a lot of people have had 
documented medical anomalies crop up consistent with their belief that this 
is indeed what is happening to them_. 


 






<p>
Carl Sagan and others have told us over and over how strange alien contact 
will be.  The situation we have now, it seems to me, is just strange enough 
that it might be for real (on some level, not necessarily "extraterrestrial").

<p>
Here are what I personally consider "essential" books on the subject:

<p>
"Flying Saucers: A Modern Myth of Things Seen in the Skies" Carl Jung<br>

<p>
"The Invisible College" "Dimensions" "Forbidden Science" Jacques Vallee<br>

<p>
"Confirmation" Whitley Strieber (fascinating and very sober)<br>

<p>
"Above Top Secret" Timothy Good (touches on conspiracy theory, but also <br>
demonstrates quite clearly that at least some UFOs are decidedly physical 
objects)
