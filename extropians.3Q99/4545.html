Do we really know they are safe?  For all we know the infiltrators started 
out with some such isolated region, then moved on to more densely populated 
areas later.  That approach would certainly have advantages - having an 
area where everyone is under control would give them a place to do illegal 
things wihtout having to hide them, which would be handy for lots of 
reasons.

I've run up against this issue in RPGs before, and I've never been able to 
find a good solution.  Mental privacy and public trust seem to be mutually 
exclusive once sophisticated mind control becomes a possibility, but you 
need both to make a free society work.
