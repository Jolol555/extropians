Tidal force is proportional to the mass of the body causing the force and
inversely proportional to the cube of the distance to that body. 
Plugging in the mean distances and the masses for the sun and moon, I get
the result that the tidal force due to the moon is 2.176 times that due
to the sun, or, to put it another way, the sun's effect is 46% of the
effect of the moon.  Of course that ratio varies somewhat as the
distances vary somewhat during the month and year.

<p>
Tidal ranges are minimized when the sun and moon are about 90 degrees
apart in the sky (quarter moon), and maximized when the sun and moon are
lined up with the earth (full moon, new moon).  The minimum is called
'neap tide', the maximum 'spring tide".


<p>
Interestingly, for spherical bodies of the same density, the tidal effect
is simply proportional to the cube of the apparent angular size of the
body.  The sun and moon are just about the same size as seen in our sky,
so based on that approximation the sun would be about 46% as dense as the
moon.  The actual ratio is 42.2%, since the apparent diameter of the sun
at mean distance is really 2.9% greater than the apparent diameter of the
moon at mean distance.  (Check: 1.029 cubed times 42.2% = 46%).  The
tidal effect of Jupiter on the Earth, at closest approach, is .00128%
that of the sun.
