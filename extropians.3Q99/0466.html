<p>
Of course.  In a sense, people do that now.  One example is the previously
mentioned extropian smokers, who hope nanotech will come along and repair
the damage.  Did not our society go through a wave of careless screwing
when we developed penecillin?  When there were rumors of AIDS having
a cure a couple years ago, there was a wave of new cases (Oh boy!  Toss
the balloons, Baby!)

<p>
Speaking for myself, there are a lotta things I would looove to try, if I
knew my body could be repaired, such as racing motorcycles.  And
of course the careless screwing would be nice too...  {8^D  spike
