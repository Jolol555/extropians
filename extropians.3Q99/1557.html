You make a good point. I haven't double checked your numbers but they
sound about right to me. I have only 2 minor quibbles, neither effect the
strength of you argument by much.


<OL>
  <li>  I was figuring a supernova about 8 light years away not 2.
  <li>  A dangerous radiation dose is much less than a lethal one.


</OL>
<p>
Nevertheless I now think that neutrinos from a supernova is of
no danger to any civilization, you'd have to be so close you'd
already be vaporized by more conventional radiation. Neutrinos
aside we'd still be in very serious danger from a supernova 2 light
years away, or even 8, but a super civilization could survive.

<p>
The thing that fascinates me about an intense neutrino beam is
that the is no defense even a super civilization with full Nanotechnology
could mount against it. If beams of that power actually exist it's clear that
conventional supernovas didn't make them. I've seen some exotic models of
rare Hypernovas and black hole formation that might do the trick, but unlike
supernovas there is no experimental conformation that they actually
produce the number of neutrinos that theory says they should.
