<p>
I would also expect that the minimum size for a sudden takeover would be
a small country, a very large lab (major corporation), or more likely a
large country.</a>  I wouldn't expect a small lab to be capable of it,
unless AI has advanced to the point of semiautomated design by the time
of the assembler breakthrough.

<p>
Note that if the assembler breakthrough does occur in a small lab, then
we have a *real* problem, because more than one large power might get
ahold of the technology.  "One person can take sips from a tidal wave; a
thousand people, or two people in competition, cannot..."

<p>
I think it's because of our visualization of the technology.  For
example, no matter how crude nanotechnology is, once you can infiltrate
NBC security and cause small explosions in a precisely defined
locations, then that's enough to conquer most countries.</a>
