<i>&gt; analogies to orgasm here....</i><br>

<p>
I don't follow Phil here.  Obviously, if an orgasm is like a positive
feedback loop, then this can also be done on nonorganic hardware.  Heck, the
example he uses -- the piercing screach of a speaker-microphone loop -- is
hardware!

<p>
My point was and IS that I think this can be done in a computer too.  Maybe
things will have to be redesigned a bit, but it's not ruled out by anything
Ralph Lewis or Phil Osborn have written that I've read.

<p>
And if anyone should bring up that current computers place limits on such
feedback loops, I'd also point out that human brains seem to have similar
limits.  After all, orgasms only last a brief period in most people.  They
do not go on for years until your head pops.:)

Cheers!
