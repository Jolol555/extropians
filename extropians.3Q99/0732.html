Whoa -- maybe MLA or someone doesn't like embedded acronyms, but hackerdom is 
certainly fond of nested and even recursive ones, "Gnu's Not Unix" being a 
very familiar example (not only recursive but also false in all but a narrow 
legalistic sense). 

<p>
My favorite of all time was not nested, but self-referential: TLA for "Three-
 Abbreviation."

<p>
Enough usage also tends to make acronyms into words. A recent example set my 
teeth on edge: there was a poster announcing a social event at work, which 
contained "Please RSVP" (translates to "Please respond, please" -- the place 
runs on "AC current", too, I'll bet) and "we will need your RSVP by [date]."
