<p>
I was there and found it fairly "interesting".  Someone in the audience,
I believe asked Marvin what he considered to be a stupid question
(somebody correct me if this is wrong).  Marvin's response was, I
believe, in essence, "That's a stupid question, could you sit
down so we could move onto the next question".  The person refused
and then things got very loud.</a></a>

<p>
You have to realize that Marvin does this intentionally because he
is trying to break up the "crappy" memes that most of us are stuck
with.  I would have to believe that someone who has spent 40 years
thinking about AI problems knows a little more than the rest of us
(though he certainly got Neural nets wrong...).  So for there to
be people who use what some consider to be "rudeness" as a
technique to break up thought patterns, is not in my opinion
a bad thing.  I wouldn't however want the entire world to be
like that.

<p>
You may be able to get a tape of that Extro3 session from EI
if you want the gory details.
