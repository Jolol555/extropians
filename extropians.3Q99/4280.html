<a href="4277.html#4280qlink1">&gt; There was a science fact article in Analog a coupla years back, in which it</a><br>
<i>&gt; was suggested to build very tall "cooling towers" (~7000 m tall by 2000 m</i><br>
<i>&gt; diameter) which would produce strong updrafts, including cloud formation</i><br>
<i>&gt; and precipitation inside.  The rain would be captured for potable water</i><br>
<i>&gt; use, the winds tapped by turbines, and the sea surface for many km around</i><br>
<i>&gt; cooled by evaporation, thus removing the power source for hurricanes.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4317qlink1">How would the towers cool?  Would they be painted white to reflect
sunlight, or is there some other effect?  Takes a mighty big air
conditioner...</a>

<p>
<a name="4317qlink2">I ask because I have seen claims that towers would, in and of themselves,
produce cool air updrafts because as the air rises it expands, hence
<a name="4317qlink3">it cools.</a>  However this does not work, because the same effects occur
in the atmosphere outside the towers, which is why mountains are cooler
than valleys.  So I wonder if these cooling towers in Analog had some
other principle in mind.
