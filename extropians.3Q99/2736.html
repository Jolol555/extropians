<p>
You may wan to read "The Red Queen" (or some other related books
like "Sperm Wars"), documenting the difference in the sexual
strategies between men and women.

<p>
Women are "manipulative" due to the requirement for "Plan B".
Women (in evolutionary times) mate with a man so he can provide
resources for her and her offspring.  However, being a man is
a hazardous profession, women live in fear of their mate not
coming back from the mastadon hunt or having him stolen by
a younger woman (more able to bear his children)...  Given
that situation, the best strategy is "Plan B" -- have another
man that you can entice into being your mate, should mate A
suffer an accident or be lured away.  To make "Plan B" work,
you have to be *very* clever (manipulative), in that you
have to make potential mate B think he has a chance without
letting mate A discover this.  For if mate A discovers this
he may start to wonder whether those children he has been feeding
are his or B's.  This will cause him to (a) pick a fight with
potential mate B; (b) exercise his mate B option deserting
his mate A and any children; (c) kill the children of
questionable parentage and begin again (thus negating female
mate A's large investment in previous offspring).

<p>
If this isn't a recipe for producing "manipulative" behavior
in women, then I don't know what is.  So it isn't women
you should be griping about -- it is the womens' *genes*.

<p>
I have a friend who is a classic example of this.  She is
an ultimate controller/manipulation entity (self-admitting).
In looking at her background, I can't find much that would
have "trained" her for this (her parents were both well
educated, engineer/scientist types and very laid-back).
I can only suspect that she is homozygous for the "manipulation"
genes.

<p>
<a href="2720.html#2736qlink2">&gt; Not that I'm accusing you of any of this.  With the billions of women out </a><br>
<i>&gt; there, there will always be some who buck the trend.  Just not enough.  Most </i><br>

<i>&gt; years of life, giving them the political majority to use the state's gun to </i><br>
<i>&gt; force their "progressive." anti-futurist views down all our throats.</i><br>

<p>
I was surprised a few years ago, when when I stood up in a
meeting of the Gerontological Society of America in a session
that I believe was on Health Care Economics, and announced
that as the president of a biotechnology company that was
working on the molecular biology of aging, we had one fundamental
goal -- to *eliminate it* and that *only* this approach would solve
the problem of health care economics (due to the fact that
a large drain on the health care system is to individuals
in the last year of their lives).

<p>
That comment drew cries and protests from the audience.  The
net of the feedback I got, was -- how could I consider
elimintating aging?  If I recall correctly, the session was
part of the "sociological" division of the GSA (which has
3 divisions: biological, medical and sociological).

<p>
One has to wonder if most of the protests were from women
(who I would argue, are probably in greater numbers in
the sociological, than the medical, than the biological
divisions [of course with no evidence to confirm this]),
who view lifespan extension (and/or the elimination of
aging) as a fundamental threat to one of their
self-perceived "values" to the race (i.e., their
ability to bear children).  Women who identify themselves with
child-bearing may inherently be anti-longevity because
if one can live forever, there is less desire/drive
to leave behind a memory (as offspring) and an inherent
problem that eventually non-dying individuals will consume
all of the resources and eliminate the possibility of
reproduction.

<p>
<a name="3147qlink2"><a name="2856qlink1">So recontextualizing, the "progressive, anti-futurist" argument --
these women are simply fighting (tooth and nail) for the survival
of their genetic design function -- to bear offspring.
