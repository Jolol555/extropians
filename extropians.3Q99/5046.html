Mike Darwin, posting to the cryonet, today, responds to the following
comment by Robert Ettinger:

<p>
"&gt;I believe 21CM has a different class of substances it calls ice 
<br>
<a href="4604.html#5046qlink1">&gt;blockers, acting through a different mechanism.</a><br>

<p>
by saying:

<p>
<i>&gt;This is correct. This work, begun by Brian Wowk, has continued to progress</i><br>
<i>&gt;at an astounding pace. In no small part this been due to truly hurculean</i><br>
<i>&gt;efforts by Eugene Leitl, who I have seen putting in day after, day after</i><br>
<i>&gt;day of 14, 16 and even 20 hours at a stretch working to synthesize novel</i><br>
<i>&gt;ice blocking molecules: a task in which he has succeeded remarkably!</i><br>

<p>
<a name="5144qlink1">Eugene, you've hinted at this a couple of times recently.  If you can do so
without giving away the store, perhaps you might elaborate a bit.</a>

<p>
<a name="5144qlink2">And if you can't, well, thanks for the effort, congratulations on your
accomplishment, and keep up the good work.</a>


<p>
			Best, Jeff Davis
