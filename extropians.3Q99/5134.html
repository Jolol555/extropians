I will be attending the following conference in NY and discussing
Transhumanist and Extropic Arts at the Breakout Session:


<p>
ARTSCI'99:  
<br>
NURTURING COLLABORATIONS FOR THE NEXT CENTURY
a symposium produced by Art and Science Collaborations, Inc.

<p>
November 13-14, 1999
<br>
(Saturday - Sunday)<br>
<br>
The Great Hall, Cooper Union
<br>
New York, NY
<br>
9:00 AM - 6:15 PM

<p>
The turn of this millennium finds a will to integrate, merge, and
collaborate - to bring unity to the various expressions of life - including
art, science, and the humanities.  But how do people find oneanother?

<p>
SCIENTISTS:  Have you ever wanted to collaborate with a musician, visual
artist, writer, etc. on a project of shared inspiration?  Some artists are
making music from DNA code, creating 3-D digital visualizations of protein
molecules, writing plays about AIDS, etc.  With over 50,000 professional
artists, New York City is the right place for such an event!   1/3 of our
Event Program has been specifically designed to enhance personal meeting
<br>
(including small Break-Out Sessions and Breakfast Socials).<br>

<p>
ARTISTS:  Have you ever wanted to collaborate with a geo-physicist on an
underwater environmental art project, a bio-ethicist on a Broadway play of
socio-political import, have the opportunity to meet people like an Emmy
Award-winning science producer of shows like NOVA, hear a neuro-scientist
speak about switching back and forth between careers in both art and
science, hear about the development of a unique art-sci curriculum for
model educational programs, or be there as directors of new
multi-disciplinary research programs at universities "search" for new
talent for their group?

<p>
HUMANITIES:  ArtSci99 will inspire, inform, and provide the opportunity to
make new contacts for facilitating your next art-sci book, article, play,
public art project, interdisciplinary educational cirriculum, TV
documentary, or help in your search for outstanding new talent for an
up-coming conference,  your corporation or university.

<p>
The mission of ARTSCI'99 is to create a formal vehicle that will nurture
art-science collaborations for the next century.  Models of "modern-day
Leonardos", the new paradigm of *artist-scientist research teams*, panels
on timely issues, and small group Break-Out Sessions posing provocative
questions will be presented.  Keynotes are by:  Dr. Laurence Smaje, the
Director of the "Sci-Art" progam of the Wellcome Trust (London), one of the
few institutions commissioning such collaborations
<br>
(<a href="http://www.welcome.org">http://www.welcome.org</a>), and Dr. France Cordova, the first woman to hold<br>
the position of Chief Scientist at NASA, and now is the Vice Chancellor for
Research at the University of California at Santa Barbara... and mastermind
of their "Research Across Disciplines" Program.  <a href="http://research.ucsb.edu">http://research.ucsb.edu</a>
