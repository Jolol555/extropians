The online test is most likely highly abbreviated in the first place,
and just the core IQ test. The test battery you mention above likely
includes a lot of other stuff, it sounds a bit like the WAIS test plus
some extras; that test studies overall cognitive functioning and can
be used to check certain aspects of personality etc. If it was WAIS,
then the result isn't a single score, but a whole list of traits
corresponding to memory, spatial ability, understanding of the world,
personality etc. It is likely more revealing than a single score, but
harder to interpret. Also, tests such as WAIS are mainly used to
diagnose problems, not evaluate healthy or bright people, they tend to
answer so well that many tests can't distinguish them.
