I was amazed to have returned after over a year's absence to find it still
going on!  And it had already turned ugly a few years ago.  An essay posted
to the extropian list, relating the gun debate to my own views on
transhumanist tenets, had somehow been forwarded to an NRA listserve.  Boy,
was that a fun week--I gave up on trying to craft any rational reply to the
emails that flooded</a> in.

<a name="5061qlink2">Attempts have been made to have moderated discussions of guns and gun
control regulations on some of the more serious news shows here.  Sadly,
several of the spokespersons no longer are invited onto television because
of their conduct during those discussions.  I say sadly, because this is a
discussion that badly needs to be had, publicly and rationally.</a>
