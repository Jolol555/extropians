<p>
I'm reading Gerald Taylor's book "The Race for Consciousness".  Has anyone 
else read this book?  Taylor lays out the neuroanatomical and functional 
details of what he calls his "relational consciousness" model, making (to my 
layman's eyes) a detailed argument from the neuronal level, through the level 
of individual neural net circuits, up to the functional level, that the "hard 
problems" of consciousness and cognitive science (even *qualia*) can all be 
explained through the "competition" of cognitive "primitives" (my term) 
instantiated in specific neural net representations.  He cites a good deal of 
empirical work, including clinical observation of brain damage and 
dysfunction, surgical experiments on humans and other animals, network 
simulation and straightforward neuroanatomy.  He also relates his 
explanations to every other major work in cognitive science of which I'm 
aware.  Although not particularly well written (it could have really have 
been improved by a thorough editing from a literary viewpoint), this book has 
impressed me for just how completely an exhaustive list of cognitive 
phenomena can now be linked to specific brain areas and functions, so much so 
that I keep wanting to ship copies of it to working AI researchers.

<p>
I'd be keenly interested in any opinions by folks more informed about 
cognitive science of the theories and analysis contained in this book.  The 
schematics contained in this book look to me to be a fairly detailed plan for 
a working general-purpose AI.
