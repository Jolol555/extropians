<a href="2665.html#2686qlink1">&gt; Or you can manipulate the loopholes in the system</a><br>
<i>&gt; (provided you have enough</i><br>

<i>&gt; people, or even by</i><br>
<i>&gt; disadvantaging other people.</i><br>

<a name="2697qlink1">The only way to be wealthy and not help other people is to be a miser
and spend no money at all.</a>  Even the scummiest greediest bastard
capitalist helps society.  When he spends his great sums of wealth he
pays the salaries of workers who provide him with the trappings of
wealth.  His millions spent pay for children's educations, feed the
families of the workers building his super high rent luxury condos.  

<p>
It might even be argued that the greedy sumbitch who never pays a penny
into charity provides more for humanity than Joe Blow the Peace Corps
volunteer who knows that money is evil and won't ever earn more than
10K in a given year.

<p>
Of course, Joe Blow might be happier, but that's a different story.

"If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from us in peace.  We ask not your counsel nor your arms.  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.  May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen."   --Samuel Adams
