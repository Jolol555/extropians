<a name="3832qlink1">If you become a connoisseur of tabloids, you will soon learn that the
Weekly World News lies at the very bottom of the credibility scale.
The publication is full of ape-children, alien babies, giant beasts of
all sorts, biblical prophesies come true, and so on.  It is actually
quite entertaining, but I have the impression that virtually everything
in the magazine is invented from whole cloth.</a>

The National Enquirer, on the other hand, is reasonably accurate,
although its focus on celebrity love spats and the like is not nearly
as interesting as the material in WWN.
