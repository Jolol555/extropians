If the Moon is near Venus tonight, it was pretty close to it last night.
<a name="1655qlink2">So if you observed the Moon the night before, it is plausible that you
would correctly imagine it close to Venus in your dream.</a>  As for the
Arabic BBQ, perhaps you smelled the food.  It is common to incorporate
sensory experiences into dreams.  A stray breeze might have brought
the smell to you, even from a remote part of the building's roof, even
for just a short time, and even at a level which would not be noticed
consciously.  The food might have smelled Arabic, or you might have
known that there were Arabic people living in your apartment building.

<p>
For the second case, where you and your friend appeared to share the
same dream, it is possible that you had similar dreams influenced by some
earlier shared activity or discussion.  Also, in describing your dream
to your recently-awakened friend, he may have imagined your description
so vividly that it overrode his memories of what was actually only a
slightly similar dream.  Our memories of dreams are often sketchy and
it is easy to imagine that they might be altered somewhat.
