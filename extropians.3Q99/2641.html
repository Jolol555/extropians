From: "Robert J. Bradbury" &lt;bradbury@www.aeiveos.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink1">&gt;&gt; I couldn't agree more. I'm not interested in biotech crops whose</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; purpose is to be able to successfully douse the fields with</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "Roundup", in fact I oppose such bioengineering.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink2">&gt;Careful...  There are a couple of problems here -- At least</a><br>
<i>&gt;in my Biology class when they went through plant biology they</i><br>
<i>&gt;indicated that Roundup *only* affects plants, doesn't impact</i><br>
<i>&gt;animals at all because we don't have those biochemical pathways.</i><br>
<i>&gt;So if you were saying that you didn't like herbicides because</i><br>
<i>&gt;of health effects, you are stepping on the wrong beast with Round</i><br>
<i>&gt;Up. If you were saying that you didn't l2ike engineering crops</i><br>
<i>&gt;so some would resist Round Up, I suppose that depends on</i><br>
<i>&gt;what other methods of weed control you can cost effectively do</i><br>
<i>&gt;and how much you don't like companies making money off of their</i><br>
<i>&gt;inventions.</i><br>

<p>
I'm concerned with runoff. How much does Roundup effect the plant
life in my local trout stream? How about other local flora? I guess
I'm wondering too how well its been tested against soil microbes,
and fungi. Plasmids are so sneaky....



<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink3">&gt;&gt; I have a hunch this will backfire anyway as plasmid transfer</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; renders the weeds immune as well.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink4">&gt;But science doesn't stand still.  You can probably keep</a><br>
<i>&gt;engineering genes that render the crop plants "immune" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;whatever toxin you want to dump onto the weeds.  We just</i><br>
<i>&gt;aren't at the point where we can do it in such a way that</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is a multi-gene system, in multiple places in the genome</i><br>
<i>&gt;so it doesn't transfer easily.  Ideally you would like to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be able to run through the field, vaccinate all the crop</i><br>
<i>&gt;plants and dump a lethal virus on the weeds all in one</i><br>
<i>&gt;sweep.</i><br>

<p>
I'm all for good science, even good biotech. "Roundup Corn" seems
only designed to benefit it's manufacturers.


<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink5">&gt;&gt; I'll take a Brandywine tomato over a "flavrsavr" anyday...</a><br>
<i>&gt;If you are saying home-grown vs. industrially farmed, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would agree.</i><br>

<p>
A Brandywine is probably the best of the homegrown varieties....
Yum!!!!

<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink6">&gt;&gt; I suspect such crops would do poorly in the field, you can make</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a  good case that we have evolved (except in Kansas) the abilty</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;to  deal with these "natural" toxins.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink7">&gt;This is true, but it all has to do with dose-response.  Our</a><br>
<i>&gt;responses may be able to deal with a "typical" dose, in that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;accumulated lifetime risk only causes cancer in someone at an</i><br>
<i>&gt;average age of 80. Natural selection could not vary our</i><br>
<i>&gt;detoxification levels to allow us to get to 120 because before we</i><br>
<i>&gt;never got to 80.  There is actually a fairly large amount of</i><br>
<i>&gt;genetic variation in humans in these areas.  The general rule is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that if a gene didn't impact your reproductive fitness before</i><br>
<i>&gt;probably age 30, then nature has probably let lots of variations</i><br>
<i>&gt;creep into it.  We never got high doses of toxins historically</i><br>
<i>&gt;because we learned (either genetically or from our tribe) what the</i><br>
<i>&gt;really bad ones were. Our genome breeding efforts to reduce toxin</i><br>
<i>&gt;levels is way behind our plant breeding efforts to increase</i><br>
<i>&gt;toxins.</i><br>

<p>
I agree completely, especially the genetics part.


<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink8">&gt;What you really want to do is engineer the plants with something</a><br>
<i>&gt;like a Bt-toxin that is highly specific for whatever insect pests</i><br>
<i>&gt;bother a specific crop type.  You want it to be highly insect</i><br>
<i>&gt;specific and completely nontoxic to humans.  Fortunately there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;enough difference between insects and humans genetically that I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would hold out some hope for this.</i><br>

<p>
Don't forget some mechanical possibilities, i.e. large sticky hairs
on leaves and stems to thwart pests.. Plus the lesson from organic
farming is that truly healthy soil has few pest problems.

<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink9">&gt;&gt; I don't know how much lab work we really need. New companies</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;like SOC not only save and reproduce heirloom seeds, but breed</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;new  varieties. Millions of backyard experimenters sound's like</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;a better way to go.....</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2640.html#2641qlink10">&gt;This sounds like the self-evolving AI approach (bottom-up).</a><br>
<i>&gt;I favor the top-down approach when you know exactly what the genes</i><br>
<i>&gt;(or gene-produced chemicals) do.  I would agree that preserving</i><br>
<i>&gt;native genomes is a very useful thing to do because they all</i><br>
<i>&gt;have some interesting and special features that we may one</i><br>
<i>&gt;day want to make use of.  Saving the old ones is much easier</i><br>
<i>&gt;than inventing new ones.</i><br>

<p>
I favor top-down when we know exactly what effects (total) the
changes will have. The bottoms-up has the advantage of "grassroots"
(heh,heh) support.

<p>
Here in Northern Illinois a number of farms that went under have
been purchased to produce organic specialty crops for the white hot
restaurant business here. Many have exclusive contracts with a
specific restaurant. Very profitable.....
