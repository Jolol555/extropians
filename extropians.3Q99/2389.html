<p>
It depends. If we can find (nobody knows how difficult this is, a
distributed.net/bochs project with a some 10-100 k participants can
give us at least a slight idea) a good enough machine code mutator
prior to the release of the worm to end all worms, the more power to
us. If we can't, the combined power of the Net might find it for us as
a side effect. Such a mutation function would very very valuable
indeed. It would also help us to get rid of brittleware.

<p>
(Even as just a killer demo, a nonmutating Wintel variant of the
Morris worm will make a lot of people listen up if it takes out 80% of
the net in a single afternoon. Software diversity will be increased
and code review procedures will be made much more stringent in the
aftermath (I don't think <a href="http://www-ccs.cs.umass.edu/~shri/iPic.html">http://www-ccs.cs.umass.edu/~shri/iPic.html</a>
IP stack implementation has a lot of holes). We would ratchet up
global system security quite a bit, for the equivalent of a bloody
nose).

<p>

<p>
It would be a good idea to supply the worm with a fortification
functionality (making it the equivalent of a symbiont), patching the
ingress hole &amp; thus protecting the host from infections of other
worms. Finding the hole is not equivalent to fixing it, however.

<p>
OSses should learn to mutate, too. Of course this might remove needed
functionality, however systems don't persist in metastable regimes
forever.

<p>
<a href="2355.html#2389qlink3"> &gt; getting this all wrong, would result in the coevolution of better</a><br>
<i> &gt; worm-detectors and better worms until some sort of security equilibrium was</i><br>

<i> &gt; reminds me of the proposal (also on this list) to genetically engineer a new</i><br>
<i> &gt; predator to keep mankind from slouching.</i><br>

<p>
Opcode blocks evolve in micro and milliseconds, human generations take
decades. If somebody's machine crashes it is not nearly as dramatic as
death of a person. Trying to fix flesh which is probably going to be
obsolete in less than 100 years? Makes no sense.

<p>
Such a project _should_ be tested in a large safe sandbox first, if
possible. However, currently no one seems to pursue such a project,
and meanwhile time is running out. In the early 80's nobody would have
noticed if ARPAnet went down for a week, in 2010 a global network
crash will be very serious business (pun intended) indeed. What will
happen in 2020? 2030?

<p>
I say just go for it, whether sandbox or no.
