helicopter), 
<br>
&gt; the noise due to making lift is quite low.  This is because of the low <br>

<p>
I can attest to this.  I saw the old Bell jet pack demonstrated when I was 
about 9 years old or so.  I remember REALLY looking forward to the event and 
then being a little put off by 1) that incredible noise, 2) the very short 
duration of the flight and 3) the two trucks worth of support equipment it 
required.  Clearly this gizmo was gonna take some more work before I fly to 
school with my very own jet pack . . .

<p>
Years later, I saw a Harrier demostrate some amazing precision vertical 
flight manouvers at an air show.  No question this was very cool, indeed, but 
once again, the noise was overwhelming, though.  Made the old Mahavishnu 
Orchestra sound like baroque chamber music.

<a name="2580qlink1">You might want to check out J. Storrs Hall's paper on nanotech aircars.  He 
comes to basically the same conclusions regarding size, efficiency and low 
noise, by using LOTS of VERY small rotors.</a>
