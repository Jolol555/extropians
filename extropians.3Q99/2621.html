Abstract
<br>
  We conducted a prospective study to clarify the relationship between
  mortality and body mass
<br>
  index (BMI) in a middle-aged and elderly population in
  Japan. The subjects included 12,649 people (5,686 males and 6,963 females)
  aged from 40-69 years, who were identified by a mail survey between 1987 and
  1989, and thereafter were followed up from the date of the survey until
  February 28, 1995. Cox's proportional hazards model was used to adjust for
  age, smoking status, drinking habit and occupation, and hazard ratios were
  calculated for total mortality and cancer
  mortality based on levels of BMI, while using a BMI of 22 to
  approximately 24 as a reference level. Results showed a U shaped relationship
  between BMI and total mortality in females. Females
  demonstrated a minimal total mortality in the reference
  group, but a significantly high hazard ratio in the lowest group of BMI &lt; 20
  (hazard ratio = 1.95, p &lt; 0.01) and the highest group of BMI &gt; or= 26 (hazard
  ratio = 1.71, p &lt; 0.01). On the other hand, males did not demonstrate such a
  U shaped relationship, but instead showed an L shaped relationship between
  BMI and total mortality. Males showed a minimal total
  mortality at a BMI of 24 of approximately 26 (hazard ratio =
  0.92), but a significantly high hazard ratio in the lowest BMI group (hazard
  ratio = 1.57, p &lt; 0.01). In contrast, an elevated hazard ratio was not
  observed in the highest BMI group (hazard ratio = 1.05). The relationship
  between BMI and cancer mortality was found to be similar to
  the relationship between BMI and total mortality in both
  males and females. Our findings suggest that moderate overweight may be a
  sign of good health among both middle-aged and elderly men in Japan.
