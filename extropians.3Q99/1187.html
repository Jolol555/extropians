<p>
It hasn't been mentioned because there is nothing to say, nobody knows what
dark matter is much less has the slightest idea of how it could be organized in such a
way as to produce life. I like to speculate too but I need something to go on,
otherwise it's not even science fiction, it's just a fairy story.

<a href="1183.html#1187qlink2">    &gt;one of the guiding notions of the nanotech-hypers is that once a nanotech</a><br>

<p>
I hope not but it's possible that the transition to Nanotechnology is so radical
that no civilization can survive it. If so then the probability of detecting a
civilization when it's in the very brief time span between their invention of
radio and their destruction is virtually zero.

<p>
Bottom line: if Nanotech is deadly then no ET, if Nanotech is not deadly then
we'd see ET, we don't thus no ET.
