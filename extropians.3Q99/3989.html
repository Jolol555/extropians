<i>&gt; Women are not libertarian?  Nonsense.  Women are on the cutting edge of</i><br>
<i>&gt; every human rights movement in existence.  They fight every day to keep</i><br>
<i>&gt; their health clinics from being bombed, to keep restrictive contraceptive</i><br>
<i>&gt; laws off our backs, to open doors in the sciences and technological fields.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  They lobby for increased parental control over schooling and for reduced</i><br>
<i>&gt; taxes.  Every day, women form their own companies, leap onto the Internet,</i><br>
<i>&gt; trade stocks, take off into the wilderness.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe they don't express it in the form of a particular political doctrine,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but women apply libertarian ideals in a very practical sense in their own</i><br>

<a name="3993qlink1">Women may be all for what they see as freedom for themselves (actually
security and protection from all those evil men), but at the expense of
freedoms of men. Being libertarian for yourself, but fascist toward
others in the end does not make you a libertarian. How about being for
freedom for all, regardless of gender? Feminism today is not about
equality, but superiority. Its the "I've got mine, screw you." mentality
of politics.... If we men complain we are labeled misogynists,
chauvinists, sexists, being 'inflammatory', etc. When you complain about
unfair treatment its 'justifiable'. Double standards, anyone? How about
you stop confusing freedom with security?
