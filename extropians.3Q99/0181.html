<a href="0144.html#0181qlink1">&gt; LONDON (Reuters) - Please step forward into</a><br>
<i>&gt; the future for a moment ... an android shop assistant is asking</i><br>
<i>&gt; why you want blue trousers when its database says you prefer</i><br>
<i>&gt; gray.</i><br>

<p>
(The scene:  A futuristic clothing-shop called "Morgan-Stanley
Futuristic Clothing".  A calendar at the wall says "3000 A.D. " Outside
the window, we see a cartoon-like vista obviously stolen from "The
Jetsons".  A CUSTOMER who looks remarkably like JOHN CLEESE is talking
to an ANDROID SHOPKEEPER, who looks like ERIC IDLE wrapped in aluminum foil.)

<pre>
CUSTOMER:	Hello, I'd like to buy a pair of blue trousers, please.
ANDROID:	Are you sure you wouldn't have the gray, sir?
CUSTOMER:	Gray?  No, I don't want gray.  I want blue.
ANDROID:	Are you *really* sure you wouldn't rather buy a pair of gray
trousers, sir?
CUSTOMER:	Of course I'm sure.  Why do you keep asking?
ANDROID:	Well, sir, our database indicates that you like gray trousers.
CUSTOMER:	Your database is wrong.  Now, will you sell me the blue trousers?
ANDROID:	I'm afraid I can't do that, sir.
CUSTOMER:	Well, why the devil not?
ANDROID:	Because our database says you wouldn't enjoy them, sir.  We are
</pre>
programmed to give satisfaction, and we could never sell you a product
that you wouldn't like.  But I could sell you a pair of gray trousers. 
You like those.
<br>
CUSTOMER:	I've never worn a blasted pair of gray trousers in my blasted
life, you bucket of bolts!  I can't imagine why your fool database
thinks I would like them!
<br>
ANDROID:	Well, sir, I confess I don't know how that information got into
the database.  We do have Internet-connected surveillance cameras
everywhere.  It could be as simple as an offhand remark made in a public
place, or even just a longing glance at some girl clad in gray trousers.
 But we're sure you like them.  Our database is never wrong.
CUSTOMER:	I hate gray trousers!  I think they look like someone vomited
on a pair of perfectly good trousers!
<br>
ANDROID [interrupting]:  Oh, that can't be, sir.  Our trousers are self-cleaning.
CUSTOMER:	I don't care!  Gray trousers are the work of the AntiChrist! 
Every time I see a pair of gray trousers, I want to see them ripped to
bits!  Now, will you sell me the blue trousers, or will I take my
business elsewhere?
<br>
ANDROID:	No, sir, I'm afraid I won't sell you blue trousers, and neither
will anyone else.  Your preferences are a clear part of the public
record and nobody would dream of selling you anything you rather
wouldn't buy.
<pre>
CUSTOMER:	Then I'll buy a pair of gray trousers, damn your eyes.
ANDROID:	Oh, very good, sir.
</pre>
<br>
[The ANDROID activates a laserlike device which scans the CUSTOMER's
every bodily dimension and compares them to the Internet record.]
ANDROID:	I say, sir, you seem to be gaining weight.  Have you considered
a program of exercise and exclusively Olestra-based -
CUSTOMER:	Just sell me the damn trousers before I run amok with a laser pistol.
[The ANDROID finishes scanning the CUSTOMER.  A moment later, a pair of
trousers pops out of the wall, having been downloaded over the Internet.]
CUSTOMER:	Why, what a fine pair of trousers.  Pristine, customized,
perfectly fitted, and, it would appear, gray.  I suppose they are
self-cleaning as well, so as to prevent terrible accidents with a blue
marker or perhaps a bucket of paint.
<pre>
ANDROID:	Of course, sir.  Do you wish to pay for them?
CUSTOMER:	At this point, I would rather kill you and leave the trousers
</pre>
and your shop blazing behind me, but I suppose I have no real choice in
the matter.
<br>
ANDROID:	Of course not, sir.
<br>
[The CUSTOMER slaps his hand over an instant payment auth-o-matic cred-meter.]
<pre>
CUSTOMER:	There's your bloody money.
ANDROID:	Very good, sir.  Shall I wrap them for you?
CUSTOMER:	I suppose so.
[The android proceeds to rip the trousers to shreds.]
CUSTOMER:	What the hell are you DOING?
ANDROID:	Sir, I distinctly recall you saying that you wanted to see gray
</pre>
trousers ripped to shreds.  I asked if you wished me to rip them for
you, and you replied in the affirmative.
CUSTOMER:	I'm afraid I'm going to have to zap you now.
[The CUSTOMER takes out a laser pistol and zaps the ANDROID.]
ANDROID [dying]:  I'm...going...to...tell...your...genetically...engineered...boss...on...you!
CUSTOMER:	Good luck, he thinks he's a toaster oven.
[ANDROID dies.]
<br>
CUSTOMER:	What a ghastly future.
