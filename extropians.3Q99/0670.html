<a name="0676qlink1">Ok, has anybody else on this list tried this stuff?

<p>
I really can't contain my enthusiasm anymore.  I purchased my first
bottle of SomatoPro about 5 weeks ago from IAS in the Channel Islands.
My initial motivation for buying it was as a longevity booster and
sleep-aid.  I first got a tip about it from a poster on this list a
few months back.</a>

<p>
Needless to say, since buying it the qaulity of my sleep has improved
tremendously and I wake up recharged with great memories of lucid
dreams.  One night I did not fall asleep after taking 5 capsules.
Instead I experienced a fantastic state of well-being and calm.  This
well-being effect was so strong that it was hard to ignore the parts
of my life giving me a great deal of stress - namely work. Over the
course of an hour or so I was able to resolve and dissolve nearly all
of the anxiety surrounding my current work situation.  I felt relieved
and refreshed.  Frankly, I haven't felt this good since I was 18 or 19
years old.  This may be in part due to the fact the these GHB
precursors can increase human growth hormone levels up to 16 times
normal - emulating that of a growing teenager.

<p>
I became so excited by the effetcts this stuff weas having on me I
started to look everywhere for more information on it.  SomatoPro is a
GHB precursor.  There are plenty of sites on the net where you can get
info on GHB.  GHB was made illegal by the FDA in 1990.  So companies
developed these precurssors to get through the FDA guidelines.
Another popular GHB precurssor is Renewtrient.  The internet contains
a lot of good factual information but you have to be willing to sort
through the negative publicity from the FDA or the occasional hype of
certain re-sellers.

<p>
I read further that this stuff can act as a great boost to ones
exercise regime.  So I dragged myself back to the gym after months of
not going.  In only 4 short weeks, I'm quickly getting into the best
shape of my life.  I have lost 2 inches on my waste, yet gained 4
pounds of weight.  Somehow, GHB is allowing me to go past my normal limits.  I seem to go 50-100% futher than I normally do aerobically and about 20% more anerobically.

<p>
A friend of mine just called me this morning.  He recieved his first
bottle on Saturday.  Since taking it, he has not smoked a single
cigarette.  He tells me that when the nicotine craving comes on, he
pops a capsule of SomatoPro, and the craving goes away within 30
minutes.

<p>
I can go on and on about this stuff, so I'll just stop here for now.
