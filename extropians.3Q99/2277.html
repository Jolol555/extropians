No and yes. When the universe was formed, there was likely a near
perfect or perfect ratio of matter and anti matter. Most of both reacted
with each other in that first instant and turned into energy. The matter
that was not immediately in contact with antimatter moved forward in
time enough such that it did not react at all and inflated to became our
universe. The anti matter that was not immediately in contact with
matter moved backward in time enough that it also became a universe, but
of anti matter, and is moving backward in time from our point of view.
In our matter universe there is likely little anti-matter, only that
which is created by high energy cosmological events, and only exists for
a relatively short period of time. However, every particle type found in
the catalog of subatomic physics has an equal anti-particle type that is
the same in ever way to its counterpart except that its time dimension
is a negative rather than a positive. There are some particles that SEEM
to have different characteristics than their anti-particle counterparts,
but this is typically reconciled by the negative time component.
