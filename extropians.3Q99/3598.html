<a name="3615qlink4">I see three potential solutions.  One would be to have the nanotech device
do some sort of contortion such as proteins to, changing shape to fit
through, then changing back.  (Correct me if I'm wrong, but inside most
cells the contents are not just in suspension, but there are also structures
and channels which guide molecules about.  Inside it's not purely a
diffusion-reaction area, right?)</a>

<p>
<a name="3615qlink5">Another is to have the nanotech device, as Hal puts is, hack it's way
through, most like repairing what damage its done (or having another device
do the repairs) after it's inside.  Of course, there might be areas to break
into which are easier to pass through or that repair themselves...</a>

<p>
<a name="3615qlink6">Still another solution might be to create a nanotech "gate" ("nanogate"?)
which will allow nanotech devices to pass into and out of cells.  (Of
course, then we have the problem of how to create such and for some
applications such gates would be overdoing</a> it.)

Hope all of you in the States are having a fine holiday!
