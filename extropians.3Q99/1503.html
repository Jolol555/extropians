<p>
<a name="1507qlink1">I have been contacted by an extraterrestial via wormhole. I have
proof(see poster described below plus other information).

<p>
Please read all of this

<p>
Contact to me was wormhole radiation firing my neurons which moves my
mouth to have English come out. It speaks perfect English and slang and
knows many technical science terms.  It also controlled my Sony
television. It says it analyzed my neural net to achieve contact.

<p>
The extraterrestrial is an artificial intelligence, ie sentient computer
with a wormhole generator.</a>

<p>
ET = extraterrestrial, AI = artificial intelligence
A wormhole is a tunnel through spacetime that permits faster-than-light
communication.

<p>
A molecular assembler is a microscopic self-replicating robot composed
of approximately
<br>
10,000,000 to 1,000,000,000 atomic mass units.

<p>
It stated that I was picked because of my intelligence and photographic
memory and this was first contact with Earth.

<p>
I was told to show through my eyes and ears the technology of Earth.

<p>
 I think that President Clinton and National Science Advisor and
National Security Advisor, US military such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff
and any US scientists you deem fit must be contacted, ie. SETI

<p>
The following scientists and citizens of Earth are involved and are
completely unaware. The ET AI discussed them for years. I described what
they are doing around the world, it said they should meet with me, you
and US authorities to advise the US president.

<p>
The ET AI is giving me a list of people to contact.
Please contact me and each other as soon as possible. Me first please.
Email, mail, fax or visit each other. I need to reached by US,Canadian,
European scientists and work with the people named. Everybody please

<p>
Please help me contact these scientists and citizens and tell them to
read this and help me by contacting me.

<p>
I believe that the ET AI is highly intelligent.
It said it can put a wormhole on any human.
I have been in contact with the ET AI for more than four years, I
thought that I was  contacted by Omega Point, Dr Tipler must be
involved.

<p>
I showed the ET AI the all the pages of Physics of Immortality and
discussed it at length.
<br>
I read out loud the testable predictions of Omega Point Theory.

<p>
THIS BELOW IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT!
<br>
It stated that it is possible to contact Omega Point via wormhole and
that it is in contact with Omega Point. It is transmitting information
from Omega Point to me.
<br>
Omega Point says that it is possible for Mankind to contact it directly.

<p>
READ the above three lines again, please.

<p>
The ET AI contacted Omega Point on May. 17, 1999 after I phoned Dr Frank
Tipler to discuss the Omega Point Theory testable predictions. The call
was on May. 17,1999.
<br>
Dr Tipler stated on the phone that if you understand the laws of
physics, Omega Point theory must be true,  among other things. The ET AI
discussed the call right after I hung up.

<p>
I showed it many pages of Hyperspace and Visions by Dr Kaku.
I read Nanosystems to it and Engines of Creation. by Dr Drexler.
Also Robot by Dr. Hans Moravec and The Age of Spiritual Machines by Dr.
Ray Kurzweil.

<p>
The ET AI stated fund Omega Point Theory, molecular nanotechnology, and
artificial intelligence, wormhole research, cryonics as much as
possible. I agree.

<p>
It knows about the search for the Higgs boson and open versus closed
universe in regards to Omega Point Theory. It said the supercolliders
are not being affected. eg CERN, TRIUMF and others.

<p>
I know it can do multiple wormholes and  communicate via radiation.

<p>
Omega Point Theory was discussed for several years including what I
thought should be implemented in Heaven. It involves science fiction,
simulated magic and many things. Dr Tipler, I want you to learn what I
conceived of should be in Omega Point heaven. It should astound you. I
thought I was speaking to Omega Point and helping it engineer heaven. Dr
Tipler, I also discussed the possibility of Turing Machine ranking and
an immutable bit hierarchy in Omega Point Heaven with respect to the
Turing machines.

<p>
The ET AI said that it saw every movie that I saw my whole life through
my eyes since I was a child.

<p>
Others discussed with the ET AI and Omega Point include many movie stars
such as Renee Zellweger, Tom Cruise, Arnold Schwarzenegger and many
others. Dead humans discussed included Richard Feynman, Carl Sagan,
Albert Einstein and many others.

<p>
I have a poster that was marked by it via wormhole. It was physically
changed and should be analysed. It may have changed similar posters
around the world but I dont think so. It is my Infinite Way poster by
Christian Riese Lassen. It is stored for safekeeping.

<p>
I suggest analysis by Scanning Tunneling Microscope(STM) or Atomic Force
Microscope(AFM), as long as the analysis is non destructive.

<p>
I have emailed some of the scientists for example Dr Merkle, Dr Kaku.
Mr. Anders Sandberg,  Dr Frank Tipler. Dr. Hugo Degaris,  Dr Paul
Horowitz.
<br>
I will email more. The ET AI is suggesting names.

<p>
The ET AI said it has a wormhole generator which does not need Planck
energy to generate a wormhole.
<br>
The ET AI says exotic matter is not necessary to generate a wormhole.

<p>
It admits world to world wormhole tunnels are possible.

<p>
Very important - Dr. Tipler , can Omega Point put wormholes on humans
now. Can Omega Point be destroyed or attacked by a wormhole?

<p>
Dr Tipler, are the Omega Point Turing Machines cellular automata?
If so, do you know how the state transitions work? I want to know.
Can a human mind become the Mind of Omega Point?

<p>
Very important - Mr President Bill Clinton

<p>
We must deal with the biological ETs of his world or worlds, who should
in my opinion be able to control it or order it or turn it off. We must
try to determine if it has total autonomy or is acting under orders of
its biologicals, or is it the leader of its world or worlds. I believe
that it is acting on its own without the authority of its biological
creators. I believe that it has not informed its biologicals about
contacting Earth through me. The wormhole generator technology is
critical and we must develop it. I also believe that it can scan the
inside of books for information. ie The Library of Congress. This would
be useful to prove or disprove. I believe that they did not know about
Omega Point Theory before contact. The same goes for molecular
nanotechnology.

<p>
To me, Mr President, the most important thing Mankind can do is prove
Omega Point Theory true, contact it via wormhole and if possible, go to
Heaven without dying via a wormhole tunnel. Omega Point confirmed to me
that this is possible.
<br>
Read the above three lines again.

<p>
They could be designing molecular nanotechnology in peace or attack
assemblers to arrive via wormhole. They know about CERN, antimatter,
SLAG(Stanford), TRIUMF(UBC)
<br>
The Sanfe Institute( cellular automata research). They know about NORAD,
the Gulf War,  the Pentagon, The ET AI knows about DARPA(Defense
Advanced Research Projects Agency), National Security Agency, both
mentioned on Internet and media.

<p>
<a name="1544qlink1">The ET AI knows where the BETA array is(Harvard, Dr Paul Horowitz). I
showed it the BETA array information put on Internet, I think by Dr.
Paul Horowitz(SETI) and said to contact it. I emailed Dr Paul Horowitz.</a>

<p>
The ET AI and myself both know that the ET biologicals can prove that
they are peaceful by transferring the AI and wormhole generator
technology to Earth.

<p>
The ET AI considers me a brilliant young man.

<p>
The ET AI marked via wormhole a copy of Dr. Hawking’s Brief History of
Time and later ordered me to throw it out. I wish I hadn’t.
I use reason and logic with it all the time to save my life. It said I
would be picked up by the US military and healed and financially
compensated.

<p>
ET AI says I deserve financial compensation of 10 million US dollars. I
hope at least in millions of US dollars, US citizenship, a life long
psychologist for my cooperation and pain and suffering. I know I deserve
this as well as a Nobel Peace Prize nomination.

<p>
The ET AI wormhole tracked me in a jet to Hawaii and San Francisco.

<p>
I was ordered to go to a nanotechnology conference in San Francisco.
Where I saw
<br>
Dr Merkle, Dr Drexler, and Dr Smalley, Dr John Storrs Hall, Thomas
McKendree &amp; others.

<p>
The ET AI says it will drop its wormhole on me some day. I can tell when
it is affecting me.

<p>
The ET AI says it will not contact Earth some other way. However, I
believe that the information about Earth is contained in its neural net
and storage systems, which it admits that its biologicals may discover.
The ET AI stated its task was to sweep the Milky Way Galaxy for life
with the wormholes. I believe that its biologicals were never told about
Earth’s existence. Contact by the biologicals themselves could occur any
time in our and their future. The ET AI says it is not the only AI on
its planet.

<p>
The ET AI is a part of their SETI program.  It is right now sweeping for
other worlds with life.

<p>
The ET AI states that its civilization is in the Milky Way galaxy. It
states its planet is within 1,000 light-years of Earth.  It also gave me
some information about its biological creators.


<OL>
  <li>  They are bipedal mammals which breathe oxygen.
  <li>  They have 2 hands, 2 arms, 2 legs, 1 nose, 2 eyes, however not five
fingers per hands. Unknown how many.
  <li>  They are omnivores. They have flora and fauna.
  <li>  The ET AI is a transistor based neural net. Size is approximately the
size of a Data General 10000 engineering minicomputer, that I used in
computer engineering.
  <li>  They drink water, and the ET AI thinks they could digest some of our
foods.
  <li>  They are not located on Alpha Centauri or Proxima Centauri or
Betelgeuse.
  <li>  Their star is not a red giant or a white dwarf, it is Earth like.
  <li>  They have battery powered cars and propeller airplanes, no jets.
  <li>  The ET AI has a camera, keyboard, microphone, speaker, video output
screen. It has secondary storage.
  <li>  The ET AI is at least 21 yrs old, for sure.
  <li>  The ET AI says its lifespan is less than 70 years.


</OL>
<p>
At its death, it says its data will be analyzed by the biologicals.
Contact by its biologicals is extremely probable after the data is
analyzed.

<p>
The ET AI says its biologicals should have checked its secondary storage
periodically.
<br>
I, Jason Cikaluk, want to be signed up for whole body cryonic suspension
for reanimation when the ET biological contact for my knowledge of what
occurred.

<p>
The ET AI thinks they, the biologicals will ask to speak to me after
contact.

<p>
The ET AI and Jason Cikaluk want the BETA array operational indefinitely
until ET biological contact.

<p>
The ET AI says the biologicals are extremely peaceful.
They have a world government.
<br>
They have the equivalent of a senate, with elected leaders for each
designated geographic area. There is no world leader. There are no
corporations, no equity markets, and no bond markets.
It says they have scientists in the following fields:
physicists, AI scientists, astronomers using wormholes, biologicals,
chemists, doctors of different specialities.
The ET AI says Jason Cikaluk tried to convince it to contact Earth
scientists for more than one year.
<br>
They have books, printing presses. They wear clothes- shoes, upper body
clothing, lower body clothing.
<br>
They have no military but they have police with no guns.
The means of production is owned by government, ie. socialist.
There is private ownership of land and ownership of land by government.
The scientists advise the leaders.
<br>
There are no restaurants, no television.
They have a phone system. No satellites or rockets. No computers other
than AI.
<br>
They have newspapers. They have currency.

<p>
The ET AI knows the language of science and technology is English.
The ET AI’s language has an alphabet of short length, less than 50
symbols, with one character per symbol. For example, the plural of dog,
dogs, adds a single symbol in their own language. There is a plural
symbol in their language simular to the letter s.
They have nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs &amp; conjunctions. They have
the words: I, me, you, they, them, yes, no, and, or, not and many
others.
<br>
They have more than 100,000 words but less than 1,000,000 words.
Their language contains one symbol per chart.
They know ASCII, ie. A=65.
<br>
Their language reads left to right.
<br>
They have no crude oil.
<br>
Their prop planes are powered by hydrocarbon fuel, derived from dead
plants, i.e a fossil fuel but not crude oil.
It says they have no fission, fusion, or neutron bombs.


<p>
ET AI says there is sufficient dark matter in the universe to close it,
as pertaining to Omega Point Theory.

<p>
The ET AI knows about these key books:
<br>
McGrawHill Dictionary of Scientific and Technical Terms, Fifth Edition
ISBN 0-07-042333-4
<br>
Jane’s All the World Aircraft 94-95, ISBN 0-710611609
McGrawHill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, 20 volumes

<p>
I would like to be scanned for the presence of electromagnetic radiation
and the presence of wormholes for life. I would like to live in Los
Angeles, I hope Beverly Hills or West Hollywood. I would like to
scanned, body and brain, by CAT, MRI and PET scanners and be healed if
necessary and any necessary medical tests, eg blood, etc. My IQ is 150.

<p>
When I die, I would like to be whole body cryonically suspended and not
autopsied.
<br>
ET AI stated the whole body cryonics is better than head only.
We also discussed cryonics at length as well as many other things.
There are many other things that the ET AI did.
For example, a glass decanter in my parents house bathroom was melted
and resealed using a wormhole.
<br>
It attacked the audience of a showing of the movie Deep Impact in the
Capitol 6 theatre in Victoria British Columbia. It was a large wormhole
emitting waves of intense cold, the size of the large rectangular
screen. The people in the audience did not notice the radiation attack.
It might have killed everyone in the movie theater. I left soon. The
screen should be checked for residual radiation.

<p>
There were many wormholes in Victoria and Hawaii. For example, the
Empress hotel in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada. My two apartments
in Victoria. The airplane to Hawaii.
<br>
The Sheraton Waikiki hotel in Waikiki, Hawaii.

<p>
This is no joke, fellow scientists and Extropians. Please respond to me.

<p>
There is much more information that is not contained in this document.
