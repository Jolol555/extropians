<a name="3840qlink1">This is where Eliezer's doubled doubling breaks down- smart AI's might
optimize their own code, but faster execution requires faster hardware,
which is tied to a physical realm where Moore's law is difficult to
shortcut.  An AI singularity can't occur unless the time constant for
hardware improvement and replication can also be shortened.

(Massively parallel processor systems can grow in processing power only
linearly.  Even if more chip fabs are brought on line, it's the rate of
creation of chip fabs that limits progress.)</a>

Is it just me, or does it seem ironic for Eliezer to be calling anyone else
a naive technophile?  ;)
