Strange. When I changed my answers the score always went down by at least three
points. Maybe there's a one point question. Hold on.... OK, I just saved the Web
page and put in pre-set answers so I could quickly systematically change each
one of my answers, keeping the others the same. The score always went down, not
up. (Maybe some answers aren't right or wrong, but alter the way other answers
are scored?!) You under 16? (I'm 35.) Wait, no, an age of 15 gives 174 as the
result. (An age of 7 gives 229.) I don't get it.

I don't think that's what people here are doing, actually. (By the way, your
case would have been a lot stronger if you hadn't said "compare our _high_ SAT
scores." :)

<p>
Seriously, as a child and teenager, knowing the results of IQ tests had far more
of a negative effect on me than a positive effect. It made it harder for me to
be someone who is, as opposed to someone who "will be...."
