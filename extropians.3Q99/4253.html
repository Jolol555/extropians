I wonder if we really are any less superstitious than we were a thousand years ago, or if we’ve just replaced fairies with aliens, witch-doctors with alternative medicine, soothsayers with 1-900 numbers, mysterious demonic powers with Black Helicopters, etc.  It seems sometimes that these sort of memes fill a fundamental cognitive niche and the basic archetypes just get different wrappers and new labels.

<p>
<a href="4247.html#4253qlink2">&gt;Ah, Spike, you have voiced **the** fundamental problem we face</a><br>
<i>&gt;as extropians. Since one of the major axioms of extropianism</i><br>
<i>&gt;is to "value rational thought", the problem lies in discovering</i><br>
<i>&gt;exactly *who* is capable of this.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4247.html#4253qlink3">&gt;For *most* people, what they consider "rational" is what they</a><br>
<i>&gt;"experience" to be true. Gravity makes things go down --</i><br>
<i>&gt;I experience that so it must be true. Electricity or</i><br>
<i>&gt;gas makes stoves hot and hot things burn my fingers --</i><br>
<i>&gt;I experience that so it must be true. If I forget to</i><br>
<i>&gt;put the brakes on in my car and it runs into another object</i><br>
<i>&gt;and makes a big mess, there must be something involved</i><br>
<i>&gt;with inertial energy that must be true.</i><br>

<p>
But what about people who swear that they've had a psychic experience or felt the presence of God? From my point of view, questioning and analysing your experience is a fundamental part of being rational. Post-enlightenment style reasoning is a framework for understanding and integrating your experience - if I see something happen that I don’t understand, then I assume that there’s a rational explanation which I’m just not getting. For instance, if I have a dream which later ‘comes true,’ I assume I’m misremembering or that it’s a coincidence. I’m not sure that this is rational in the sense you discuss above.

<p>
<a href="4247.html#4253qlink4">&gt;But someplace not to far beyond the above descriptions one</a><br>
<i>&gt;runs into the limits of "personal" experience for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;average person in the population. After that one enters</i><br>
<i>&gt;the realm of newpapers claiming hermaphrodites can fertilize</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves, men can walk on the moon and FBI agents are part</i><br>
<i>&gt;of a government conspiracy to murder U.S. citizens</i><br>
<i>&gt;(spanning the credibility range from unlikely to likely</i><br>
<i>&gt;to possibly).</i><br>

<a name="4257qlink3"><a name="4257qlink2"><a name="4257qlink1">There’s a great Carl Sagan quote: “Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.” If you tell me you’ve found a new species of beetle in the Amazon, I’ll take your word for it. If you tell me you were visited by aliens, prepare to be debunked!

<a href="4247.html#4253qlink5">&gt;How do you deal with individuals attempting to invoke</a><br>
<i>&gt;rational thought when so much of rational thought depends</i><br>
<i>&gt;on the belief of what others have told you? And if you believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;what others have told you, you may just as well believe the</i><br>
<i>&gt;garbage as the stuff that is really serious.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rational thought is counter-intuitive. How can you say</i><br>
<i>&gt;something that is heavier than air should actually fly?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Eric had it absolutely right in one of his discussions where</i><br>
<i>&gt;he argued that you have to rate the raters. If you can get</i><br>
<i>&gt;a number of trusted opinions that an opinion is trustable</i><br>
<i>&gt;than that can give you high confidence in it. Then you</i><br>
<i>&gt;have the problem of getting the average person to trust</i><br>
<i>&gt;opinions of people they don't know over people they know.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;How do you get the average person on the street to believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;something in Science is any more valid than something</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the National Enquirer???</i><br>

<p>
Don’t try. Just sell them a Beanie-Baby (TM) and go about your business.
