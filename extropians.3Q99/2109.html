Admittedly, I am joining this thread *in medias res*, but it seems to me 
that Molloy has the better (more verisimilitudinous) point(s).  Surely, it 
is *not* just "Ahh, Politics and Theism---run away, run away."  It is that 
<br>
*religion-as-so-far-historically-manifested* AND <br>
*politics-as-so-far-historically-manifested* are, both cognitively (i.e., <br>
conceptually) AND socially, highly entropic, and, indeed, ludicro-pathetic 
<br>
*games* (*games* in the sense of a hybrid combination of meaning(s) <br>
combining Berne/Harris, Von Neumann/Morganstern, and Wittgenstein).

<p>
<a name="2151qlink1">As for Politics, please make a close study of Public Choice Theory in 
general, and, in particular, please read Anthony de Jasay's truly excellent 
treatise, *The State* (reprinted, with a new preface, recently by 
LibertyPress out of Indiana).  Jasay clearly and masterfully demonstrates 
that the institution *The State* does indeed have an *inherent* 
agenda/trajectory toward authoritarian/totalitarian socialism, precisely as 
Molloy suggests.  Need I even argue that this would be highly problematic 
(i.e., dangerous if not catastrophic) in the context of nanotech, AI/SI,</a> and 
<a name="2151qlink2">pico-, femto- and hyperspatial-technologies?  Now, I am open to slight (or, 
as some might see them, not-so-slight) revisions/modifications to pure 
libertarian "anarchism"</a> (see the works of Louis O. Kelso, for instance), but 
it is surely the case that the Nation-State as we know it is inherently an 
illegitimate, oppressive, expropriative, and bullying monstrosity which 
needs to be radically modified, if not, indeed, more-or-less scrapped 
altogether.  Any broad-and-deep reading of history coupled with economic and 
political/jurisprudential theory leads virtually inevitably to such a 
conclusion.  See also Randy Barnett's excellent *The Structure of Liberty* 
(Oxford U. Pr., 1998)
<br>
If we keep playing the *politics-as-usual*  **GAMES**  within 
<br>
*political-institutions-as-we-now-know-them*  (the institutions themselves <br>
being ossified *games* of decades and centuries past), then we *may* be in 
for some deep doo-doo in the not-too-distant-future.

<p>
<a name="2151qlink3">As for religion and theism....Pul-leeeze, give me a frickin' break!</a>  Surely, 
<a name="2151qlink4">organized religions are, for the most part, little more than rackets. (With 
the exception, maybe, of "free thought"---as in "Think for Yourself, 
Schmuck!"--RAW).  One need not be "religious" to be "spiritual", and one 
need not be exactly "spiritual" (depending upon what one means by this 
latter term) to nonetheless be *philosopically contemplative*, concerned 
with metaphysical (more-or-less literally meta-physical, if this is 
coherent) issues, (meta)cosmological issues and 
(meta)normative/axiological/jurisprudential issues, etc.</a>

<p>
<a name="2151qlink5">As for theism in particular, while I must give respectful credit</a> to Mortimer 
<a name="2151qlink6">J. Adler's fine attempt to come up with a coherent cosmolgical argument for 
"God" and thus give the term "God" some sort of specific meaning</a> (instead of 
<a name="2151qlink7">the *de facto* ultra-vague notion of some sort of "ultimacy" or "ultimate 
entity")---see his book *How to Think about God, an Argument for the 20th 
Century Pagan* (HarperCollins)---surely, again, anyone who takes</a> the time to 
<a name="2151qlink8">really survey the literature, will come out more-or-less atheist.  See not 
only George Smith's classic, *Atheism: The Case Against God*, but, 
especially, Michael Martin's *Atheism: A Philosophical Defense* (Temple U. 
Pr., 1989), and the late J.L. Mackie's *The Miracle of Theism* (Oxford U. 
Pr., 1986).  Also important here is the late Robert Wesson's *Cosmos &amp; 
MetaCosmos: An Argument for a Non-theistic Non-Materialism* (Open</a> Court Pr., 
1986).

<p>
<a name="2151qlink9">I'm all for "spirituality" in the sense of, say, "(meta)cosmological 
appreciativeness/contemplativeness" coupled with an extropian/eudaimonistic 
benevolence and goodwill-toward-others, but one can *HAVE* all this and yet 
be utterly secular and (more-or-less) atheistic.</a>

<p>
Just my 2 (or maybe 3 or 4) cents, guys and gals!

<p>
Ciao for now!
