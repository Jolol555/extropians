<a href="0852.html#0883qlink1">&gt; Yes. Look, I'm not going to argue with you any longer, since you've</a><br>
<i>&gt; admitted you know zilch about math. Your opinion does not count because</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is not an informed opinion. It is based on ignorance. Get educated,</i><br>
<i>&gt; then come tell me why you think they won't understand math.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
How you can see knowing how to perform proof by induction or quadratic
equations as necessary to make my point is beyond me - the specifics are not
in question. Anyway, as I said earlier, what we're debating is all
speculation anyway, neither of us can say the other is definitely wrong, so
let's just agree to disagree.....

Rob.
