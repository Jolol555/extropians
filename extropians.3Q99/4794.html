<i>&gt;  &gt; when they were new.  In historical terms (to say nothing of</i><br>

<i>&gt;  </i><br>

<p>
That's right.  One of the things I try to do here occasionally is remind 
those who live personal and professional lives almost entirely within the 
advanced scientific and technical communities, or in social settings in which 
"techno-humanist" ideas are prevalent, that this is FAR from the "norm".  In 
fact, for the vast majority of humanity - even in the First World - the 
scientific revolution and political enlightenment simply haven't happened 
yet.  This is very important because there's a real risk that things like the 
swiftly growing backlash against genetically engineered food sources will 
take technological and cultural elites by surprise.

<p>
<a href="4638.html#4794qlink2">&gt;  I guess I didn't realize how much measures of success in this group</a><br>
<i>&gt;  (these groups) involve the general public. It makes sense of course that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the general public should be taken into account!</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  But I still don't see a justification for "daring". Science and humanism</i><br>
<i>&gt;  were daring a few hundred years ago because people who advocated them</i><br>
<i>&gt;  were at risk of losing their life. Many did lose their lives.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  No one advocating really smart computers or technological enhancements</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to the brain is very likely to be executed. (There are always</i><br>
<i>&gt;  psychopaths of course. But they can target anyone.) Indeed society</i><br>
<i>&gt;  *loves* these ideas. The media has been eating them up at a ferocious</i><br>
<i>&gt;  pace.</i><br>

<p>
As the old saying goes, never underestimate the power of stupid people in 
large groups.  The images with which mass culture can become infatuated can 
just as swiftly become objects of fear and hatred.  Look how quickly the 
political ideals of the Enlightenment were mutated out of all recognition in 
just a few short months during the French Revolution, as just one 
particularly grisly example.  While I believe it is a fairly low-probability 
scenario, I think there's at least some possibility that the current wave of 
anti-genengineering hysteria could gather momentum quickly and fuel a general 
anti-scientific and anti-technological "backlash" that could result in the 
cultural equivalent of "execution".  Consider the terrifying scenario of an 
increasingly desperate Al Gore embracing Rifkinism in an explicit way and 
forcing all of the mainstream US presidential candidates into a "genetic 
litmus test".  Rifkin's big antitrust suit against the biotech companies will 
be a developing media monster precisely during the period when the US 
presidential campaign rigs up into sound-bite high gear next year.  We know 
there will be one or more major breakthroughs in human biomedical 
applications of genetic science during the same time.  Gore's already signed 
his political soul over to the religious fundamentalists . . . I leave 
fleshing out this horror story as an exercise in reader paranoia.

<p>
<a href="4638.html#4794qlink3">&gt;  The snipped stuff included a lot that sounded Libertarian. Some other</a><br>
<i>&gt;  posts made me think that extropianism *wasn't* libertarian. Well, if</i><br>
<i>&gt;  extropianism *is* libertarian, then then there's certainly a lot for</i><br>
<i>&gt;  libertarians to toast these days. But that has to do with what seem like</i><br>
<i>&gt;  very separate issues, like the state's relation to the individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;  person. Technology is a different matter.</i><br>

<p>
I disagree.  One of the fundamental energizing insights of extropianism is 
the realization that there ARE fundamental connections between social, 
economic, political and artistic values and the values that have given rise 
to the scientific and technological revolution.  Progress in one area of 
culture is intimately linked with other areas: Think Lysenko.  The values of 
critical openness found in classical liberal humanism are part and parcel of 
the scientific mind-set.

<p>
<a href="4638.html#4794qlink4">&gt;  Thanks for the lengthy, very useful article.</a><br>

<p>
You're welcome: Informed and diplomatically posed questions about "the 
basics" ARE valuable here from time to time, as they give us a chance to test 
and restate our fundamental ideas.
