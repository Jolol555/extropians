    radio tech comes to mind, although its not nearly as blatant of an 
example as personal transportation. how long has am/fm been around? we have 
ultra-wideband pulse radio tech fairly ready for introduction to the public 
sphere (this is my impression, anyway. are there really any technical hurdles 
left to be felled?) that is incredibly neater the what we have now. 
unjamable, low power, very long range, and comes with its own sort of built 
in encryption...
<p>
    but does this qualifiy as a local maxima? we have the tech, but for 
whatever reasons (true, it hasnt been around very long), its not here yet. 
but what i think might be a more distenct local maxima would be power 
generation. last time i checked, a vast majority of worldwide generated power 
was from burning coal. how long have we been burning coal, burning gas, and 
making dams? nuke power seems to be about the newest in this field, and its 
ancient, and to boot, its got a horrible reputation...

down with pants!
