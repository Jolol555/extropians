I don't know the year that the fraud was exposed, but the original studies
look very suspect on their face.  It's remarkable that they were published
at all.  There's virtually no variation in the data - every separated twin
pair has almost exactly the same deviance in their IQ's.   And separated
pairs of identical twins are extremely rare - he listed twice as many as
anyone else had ever been able to find.
