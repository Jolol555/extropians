Indeed. As an almost complete non-believer in extraterrestrial intelligence, 
I have little doubt that seti@home will find absolutely no signals from them.
However, until we look we can't be sure; perhaps we've been lucky (or unlucky!)
enough to reach this level within a few decades of a similar society a few
tens of light years away and will find them, but if not we'll at least know
that there's no-one at that level out there at this time. That is, of itself, 
a worthwhile justification for running the software on one of my PCs rather 
than yet another crypto-crack.
