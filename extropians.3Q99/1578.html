I find this odd.  Precognition and telepathy, for instance, seem absolutely
at arms with what we know from the neurosciences, and from physics (although
quatum theory can be somewhat misapplied to create semi-tangible ideas).
Even before gaining an (apparent) understanding of these subjects I always
had problems with telepathy - what combines all these disparate brain
processes for transmission?  How are they transmitted?  How does the other
brain decode them?  Why doesn't natural selection favour telepathy?  What
about precognition, even if time is asymmetric the procession of thought is
not, how could these processes possibly interact?  Those were the sort of
questions I asked myself before having the faintest idea of what the brain
was made of or how the physical world functions (I've been using computers
since aged four, I started programming not long after, I think the questions
reflect that).  Having said all this, although I had my doubts about these
things I still spent more time thinking about them than real science.

I blame television.
