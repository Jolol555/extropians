<a name="0056qlink1"><a name="0030qlink1">Since I was a child I have had problems going to bed at a reasonable hour.
Although my unstable and restlessness childhood as it were I'm sure
contributed, and I may have started an earlier pattern that I can't seem to
break, even at 30. As a early teen, doctors dosed me with heavy prescription
sleep aids to help, I often couldn't get up at all in the morning, and would
blindly head to breakfast, stars still in my eyes. Thru out the last ten
years, I have tried over the counter sleeping pills, and benadriyl, to no
avail. Now, I take three melatonin's a night, and still don't meet the
sandman until the wee late hours. If I woke up early, this wouldn't bother
me, but I still tend to compensate, and sleep too late in the day.</a>

My understanding is that most of the over the counter tablets are too
high in dosage, that you should only take 1 mg (or less).

Curious. I had started taking melatonin but had to quit after only</a> a
few days because it made me continuously sleepy.
