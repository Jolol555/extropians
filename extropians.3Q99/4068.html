  IAN: The water is significantly cooler 
  than the ground that the imagined shards 
  of glass would be sitting on, the IR from
  which would be radiating through the glass,
  and thus your point would tend to contradict 
  the claim that the flashes are IR reflections 
  from the sun. It seems foolhardy for you to 
  expound on evidence that you can't even see.

<p>
  An IR expert spent a year researching exactly
  the question of the Waco FLIR flashes being 
  sunlight. He painstakingly determined the 
  position of sun and aircraft at the exact
  moments of the flashes. The resulting analysis
  rules out the sunlight theory on that basis 
  alone (aside from other major problems with
  the sunlight reflection theory). Read this here:
  <a href="http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/B9-Report.htm">http://www.rolandresearch.com/SRGv1/B9-Report.htm</a> 
  His analysis takes into account various angles any 
  glass might be at. Please read it before commenting.
