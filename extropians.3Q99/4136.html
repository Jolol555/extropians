<i>&gt;  As opposed to the feminization of men? You don't need to "be in touch</i><br>
<i>&gt;  with your feminine side" to be a caring, considerate person. All this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  'feminine side' crap is just that: a memetic tactic to castrate men and</i><br>
<i>&gt;  change the game so it is played the way women want to play it, not the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  way its always been played.</i><br>

<p>
    alright, i know its been a couple of days, but it was sitting in my 
outbox: what relevence does "being a caring, considerate person" have, 
exactly? and do you have some kind of problem with self-castration? if i 
could efficiently be free of my hardwiring, i would agree completly with 
elizier when he said "intelligence is all that matters". primative castration 
(what weve got today) is obviously not an option, but what i want is for my 
sexuality (all emotions, actually) to be a switch, naa, make that a slider 
bar, in my head. then i could castrate myself every time the little 
testosterone gauge in the bottom-left corner of my field of vision went to 
red, if i thought it was necessary... you seem to think thats somehow wrong. 
why?
<p>
    and do "women" have a specific agenda that they intend to carry out? is 
this the same kind of unity attributed by some to the "gummint"? and is "the 
way its always been played" somehow a good thing? my "us-vs-them" meter is 
off the scale...
<p>
    side note: wouldnt it kick ass to have the equivalent of the *nix "top" 
command constantly running just inside ones peripheral vision? and a blood 
chemistry monitor... arrrrrrrrr... o well; there probably not exactly new 
ideas...
