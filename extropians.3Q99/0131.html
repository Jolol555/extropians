Forgetting a dream involves movement, if one jumps quickly out of bed and
into the day, the dream tends to become lost. Take your time upon waking,
lie there a moment and recall the dream, pehaps in a dream journal. I have
tried this myself, and it works. Although I have also found myself recalling
dreams from days ago or the previous night when I lay down to GO to sleep.
 I have to admit though, I have very vivid dreams, and in my childhood have
walked downstairs, eaten pillows and took showers with my clothes on. Since
puberty these problems have regressed, well completely disappeared, I stay
in bed and am left with colourful realistic dreams instead. They are so
strong that I often think about them thrughout the day, or connect them to
another dream later. Someone on the list mentioned getting work done in
their dreams. I have dreamt of things that I have woken up with a vision of
some new gadget or item in my dream, that I've never seen before and have
drawn in out. (and I've thought was a good idea, however out of my ability
to create)
<br>
I've gotten some responses about my late to bed and late to rise comment.
One of them was that perhaps it is genetic. I have thought about this,
because going to bed late has given rise to people fussing at me, implying
that this is intentional. I do work at home on my computer, so there is no
interference with a job. However sometimes, at meetings etc. I hate getting
up early and am warped throughout the whole thing. (I've decided from now
on, I'll show up late)
<br>
But I have heard myself say, my internal alarm clock is screwed up and have
given this some thought.
<br>
I've asked around and came up with a theory (purely unscientific of course),
I was born at 12:30 at night and several of my friends with the same problem
were also. While others born early in the morning fall asleep at the drop of
a hat. It may be crazy, but just a thought.
If I was living in some land, four hours later then here, I'd have perfect
sleeping habits!

The other problem with dreams is remembering them.  Dreams go into temporary
<br>
<a href="0113.html#0131qlink1">&gt;memory and are not usually recorded into long term memory.  It is like when</a><br>
<i>&gt;you are driving down the road and pass many cars.  You don't think about</i><br>
<i>&gt;them and don't remember them later.  This is because the conscious mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;filters everything and only records the important stuff.  Dreams are</i><br>
somehow
<br>
<a href="0113.html#0131qlink2">&gt;determined to be unimportant, so they fade away quickly.  To remember your</a><br>
<i>&gt;dreams, you need to recount the dream to yourself as soon as you wake up.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Try to remember every detail in order as it happened.  If you do this, your</i><br>
<i>&gt;conscious awake mind takes note of the information, and it will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;remembered as an important conscious waking thought.</i><br>
