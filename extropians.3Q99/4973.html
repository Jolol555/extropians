*UCSC Researchers Obtain First Detailed Images Of A Complete Ribosome<br>
Santa Cruz, CA -- Researchers at the University of California, Santa Cruz,
have taken a huge step toward solving one of the most fundamental and
daunting problems of molecular biology by obtaining images of the complete
structure of the ribosome, a key component of all living things.

*Vortices Imaged in Bose-Einstein Condensates<br>
JILA researchers (from NIST and the University of Colorado at Boulder) have
created and imaged the first vortices ever seen in Bose-Einstein
condensates, a form of matter first created in 1995 by another team at the
same institute. The condensate is a tiny, spherical ball of magnetically
trapped rubidium gas atoms cooled to less than a millionth of a degree above
absolute zero, in which the atoms exhibit their quantum mechanical wave-like
properties and coalesce into a kind of “superatom.” All along the axis of
the ball is a central region of swirling motion that resembles a
miniaturized tornado. The center of the vortex, like the “eye” of a tornado,
is filled with relatively calm, non-rotating gas. The concept of vortices
lies at the heart of scientific understanding of residual dissipation (i.e.,
resistance) in nominally viscosity-free substances such as superfluids and
superconductors. Ongoing studies of JILA’s “captive” vortex will shed light
on this complex problem. The JILA team reports this achievement in the Sept.
27 issue of Physical Review Letters. Its members are Michael R. Matthews
(CU), Brian P. Anderson (CU), Paul C. Haljan (CU), David S. Hall (now at
Amherst College), Carl E. Wieman (CU) and Eric A. Cornell (NIST). JILA is a
joint research endeavor of NIST and the University of Colorado at Boulder.

*(ASI) (Nasdaq: ANLT), a leading provider of customized data conversion and<br>

related "spatial data" markets, today announced it has finalized a long-term
strategic alliance with India-based Infotech Enterprises, Ltd. The alliance,
which was originally announced in June 1999, provides ASI with a
cost-effective overseas source of data conversion and production services,
and represents a key step in ASI's efforts to capture a greater share of the
global market.

*Poor Galileo. Just a youngster and he's under arrest -- locked in a stall<br>
and accused of being a freak. The young bovine's crime? He's a clone.
Galileo, billed as Italy's first cloned bull, was unveiled Thursday at a
dairy cattle show in Cremona. The backlash was swift from a government that
forbids cloning. The next day, the Health Ministry confiscated Galileo
pending an investigation into his creation. They also nabbed his dad, a
famous bull named Zoldo. Galileo was born at a laboratory in Cremona under
the guidance of Italian veterinarian Cesare Galli, who worked with the
Scottish scientist who created Dolly the sheep in 1997. On Saturday,
newspapers showed two handlers from the Health Ministry leading the puzzled
young bull away -- one pushing his gray rump, the other pulling his
cream-colored nose.

 *Interleukin Genetics, Inc. (NASDAQ Small Cap: ILGN) announced today the
introduction of a saliva-based genetic test for periodontal disease. This
collection method is expected to replace the Company's blood- based genetic
test, and is designed to be quick, reliable and convenient so dental
practices will incorporate genetic testing more readily. The new test is
being launched at the annual meeting of the American Academy of
Periodontology being held in San Antonio, TX from September 26 to 29, 1999.
Dr. Ken Kornman, President and Chief Scientific Officer of Interleukin
Genetics, stated, "Based on technical innovations, it is now possible to use
saliva instead of blood as a reliable source of DNA.
