<a href="1681.html#1704qlink1">&gt; Read the other papers.  How many double-blind studies in</a><br>
<i>&gt; peer-reviewed journals do you need???</i><br>

<p>
As many as would be expected for something like, say, Viagara.
5 or 10 studies, reproduced by independent laboratories or
universities (or high schools for that matter), all testing a
specific formulation to treat a specific malady, with consistent
far-beyond-placebo results to a 95% confidence factor.  Any
common over-the-counter drug would pass that test easily.  Not
one of the many studies cited comes close (though several do
show minimally positive results).

<p>
<a href="1681.html#1704qlink2">&gt; There are research areas that I consider a waste of time, wrong-headed, or</a><br>
<i>&gt; where I am not yet convinced of the validity of their theories or approaches.</i><br>
<i>&gt; But I would not condemn them with the sort of offensive, inflammatory</i><br>
<i>&gt; language that you (and some of the other posters) have used.  I accept</i><br>
<i>&gt; that men of good will can disagree, and acknowledge the possibility that</i><br>
<i>&gt; I may be wrong in my assessments.</i><br>

<p>
I can tolerate other ideas, but actions are different.  If homeopaths
did nothing but research, I would consider them merely silly.  If they
want to waste their own time, that's their business.  But they don't
just do research: they sell false hope and empty promises; they hurt
people.  They drive people away from effective medical treatment.  I am
less tolerant of that.
