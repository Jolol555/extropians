Robert Bradbury:
<br>
<a href="3148.html#3170qlink1">&gt;I strongly urge all of the libertarians reading this to go</a><br>
<i>&gt;re-read Max's principles again.  Max is a very deep thinker</i><br>
<i>&gt;and is careful not to step into many of the pits the rest</i><br>
<i>&gt;of us too easily fall in.</i><br>

<p>
It was my understanding that Max More and Tom Morrow originally authored
the Principles, and that they have gone through several revision processes
that involved the participation of any member of ExI that wanted to
contribute.  During my membership in ExI I was able to observe one such
revision process.  The openness to contribution from members to their
founding principles should be advertised as a strength of ExI.

<p>
Credit for the fine crafting of the principles should go to everyone who
contributed to them.<a name="3174qlink1">  I would find it hard to believe that a human, however
intelligent and deep-thinking, possess such an infallible mind.  If such
infallibility existed, there would have been no need to revise the
principles from their original form.</a>
