<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
As Robert points out, the future will be design limited.  If you are interested
in using solar energy, there is no need<a name="3001qlink1"> to be limited to what you can build on
</a>
some piece of land.  Your handy nanofabrication box can start turning out small
solar collectors the size of insects that fly up into the atmosphere.  There
they would collect energy and molecules so as to make hydrocarbon fuel and more
of themselves.  Soon you could have a very large Swarm Agent (SA) returning a
constant stream of fuel (and other material) to you without the use of land.

<p>
The Swarm Agent is a just a step on the path that leads to Utility Fog, but it
is one we should be able to design in the near future.  Your SA lets you "farm
the sky" and that is quite a source, but you may want to move on to something
bigger that does give you some land.  When your SA has gathered enough mass and
fuel, you can direct it to make your own island.  I am sure there will be many
ways to do this; here is one concept:

<p>
Step 1. Part of your SA coalesces to form a large fabrication engine that lands
in the ocean at a point of your choosing.  The rest of the SA keeps doing its
thing to feed this new engine.

<p>
Step 2.  On the ocean floor, the fabrication engine sends root like tubules down
into the crust of the earth, with which it extracts material.

<p>
Step 3.  When the descending tubules get deep enough, the temperature gradient
will be large enough for the fabrication engine to run by geothermal energy.
The system can then switch over from support from your SA, to its own self
contained source of energy and material.

<p>
Step 4.  With its new source of energy, that grows as it does, your large scale
fabrication engine starts growing and building up material around it so as to
rise up out of the sea and become your own island.

<p>
As you can see, the process described above has much in common with the way
natural volcanic islands are made (same source of energy and material), however,
this would not be so spectacular, as the fabrication engine would not want to
dig all the way down to molten rock.

<p>
<a name="3001qlink2">You may also see from this discussion that the process of transforming the
surface of a planet like Mars is much the same.  You need to get some nanotech
seeds sent there.  Once there they can grow on solar energy until they get to
the point to be able to switch to planetary thermal energy (most scientists
think Mars has a hot core, although probably cooler than the earth).  Once the
energy is available, there is plenty of sand on Mars from which to extract
oxygen.</a>

<p>
The Swarm Agent concept would work well for building large floating structures
in the upper atmosphere of Venus.  In this case solar energy is stronger, and
planetary thermal energy is available without digging.  (You would need to
radiate waste heat into space from the high atmosphere so as to be able to run
the heat engines.)

<p>
All of the above is just to indicate that molecular nanotechnology will make
possible anything you can design.  Material and energy will not be a problem.
<a name="3001qlink3">Cooperation among people using this will be the limiting problem.</a>  As you can
guess, an SA also makes a tremendous weapon if you want to use it that way.
<a name="3001qlink4">Also, if everyone starts making his or her own island (each intent to have the
biggest) the thermal and displacement impacts on the oceans and global weather
could be undesirable.</a>

<p>
I do not believe in Santa, but I do believe that we are about to let the
molecular nanotechnology jinni out of the bottle.  Now that we know we can do
so, there is no way to stop it from happening, and, once out, that jinni will
never go back into the bottle.  We may have to enhance ourselves to do it, but
one way or another, humanity will have to come up with the maturity to handle
this.
