<i>&gt; 'Face on Mars'. His sole remark was that the 'Face on Mars' was anomolous</i><br>
</a><i>&gt; enough to warrant some further investigation before we dismiss it out of hand.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0917qlink2">True, he never said as much, but let's face it: there's nothing at all
even remotely special about that rock, and the only reason anyone
might think there is is because ey /wants/ there</a> to be.  I've seen all
the pictures, read the descriptions, and I simply don't see anything
<a name="0917qlink3">"anomalous" or interesting, because there's nothing to see.</a>  This is
<a name="0917qlink4">not closed-mindedness, just honest observation.</a>  Wasting money on this
that could be spent looking for real extraterrestrial life is silly.

<p>
<a name="0917qlink5"><a name="0892qlink1">Resisting dogmatism doesn't mean one has to fall prey to every
baseless idea that floats by.  It just means that one should try
not to color one's perceptions by what one wants to believe.  I,
like many others here I'm sure, would like to believe that there
once was a civilization on Mars.  But there's simply no evidence
to justify that--not even enough evidence to justify wasting time
and money examining a perfectly ordinary rock.</a></a>
