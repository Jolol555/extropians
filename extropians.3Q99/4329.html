Sounds like an awfully specific effect, likely rather hard to
achieve. What could be done is of course to cloud judgement, decrease
inhibitions and induce a very negative emotional state - that might
work.

<p>
As for the crazy dog pill, I think one should not underestimate set
and setting. If you are an already violent person in a situation where
raping and pillaging are going on, being given a pill that supposedly
makes you even more aggressive (or something) will have a very strong
"placebo" effect.

<p>
One could imagine a substance that selectively inhibited parts of the
hypothalamus, making you non-aggressive. It would likely have a lot of
side effects (that part of the brain is true spaghetti code) but might
be interesting for many applications.
