Thanks for a really good post that will hopefully see us through a nice round 
of skeptical thought.  Experiences like this are, I think, relatively common, 
and I always hate to see them swept under the rug in the name of 
"rationalism."  This is precisely the approach I advocate when dealing with 
the so-called "unexplained."

<p>
Re. your "out of body" experience: I return agian and again to the  notion 
that _maybe_ there is some empirical basis for this sort of thing.  Most 
reports are, I'm quite cofident, lucid dreams (a fact that really doesn't 
take mush away from their sense of wonder).  But "dream" experiences that 
make actual predictions are another story, and seem to imply some sort of 
causal mechanism.  I don't know what this is.  I'd assume it would have to 
have something to do with quantum non-locality.  Or maybe a person's 
consciousness can actually remain intact in some unkown plasmic state for 
short durations.  Either way is fascinating, and I hope reproducable.

<p>
I've never had an experience quite as compelling as yours, but I've had some 
apparently "prescient" dreams.  These came during my junior high years, and 
would persist to the point of being a nuisance.  In retrospect, I can't help 
but wonder if they were linked to some hormonal mechanism beginning to stir 
in my brain at the time.  They haven't repeated since (at least not to a 
degree where I take any conscious note of them).

<p>
I don't dismiss "psi" outright.  It could be an organic response to quantum 
phenomena we simply don't understand entirely right now; there's certainly no 
need to invoke the "supernatural."

<p>
Someone asked earlier on a related thread if there were any science fiction 
writers in the house who had a take on psi.  I've had one book published (a 
collection--check Amazon.com and Barnesandnoble.com if you're interested) and 
have hopes for the one my agent is presumably shopping around right now.  As 
a person interested primarily in ideas, I think the concept of "psychic 
powers" would be most interesting if attributed to a _technology_ (i.e. 
neurofeedback nanomachines uplinked to some sort of utility fog).  To me, 
this is more interesting (from a SF standpoint) than the popular notion that 
we all have psychic powers but they're generally unused because we don't use 
that part of our brains.  You run across this theory a lot in "fringe" 
literature, and while there _might_ be something to it, it's not at all 
useful scientifically--yet.

<p>
Again, thanks for the casefiles, Paul.
