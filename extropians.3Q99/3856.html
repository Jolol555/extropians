  IAN: The site owner, Carol Valentine, has also 
  "debunked" the Nazi holocaust... ahem. Claims 
  of disagreement do not inherently indicate 
  that evidence is suspect. The only basis for
  disagreement in The Washington Post article 
  is the claim that the flashes are reflections 
  of sunlight. The main problem with that claim 
  is that the flashes often occur at cyclic rates 
  identical to machine-gun fire. The odds that 
  pieces of glass will often emit reflections 
</a>
  in rapid pulses is flatly implausible.

<p>
  Doctor Allard is one of the world's top FLIR 
  experts, as is Fred Zegel, quoted in the article 
  you posted to your site wherein Zegel states: 
  "In one instance, where the guys drop from tanks, 
  that was firing... There was no reflection." The 
  fact is that the flashes are ideally shaped like 
  the muzzle flashes of guns, wide at one end and 
  tapering toward the other end. There are not 
  reflections, or flashes, seen in any of the 
  areas of debris where there should be a lot
  of broken glass. The Post also observes that 
  those it queried were "defense contractors."
  It's surprising then that several of them did
  agree that the FLIR shows gun shots when you 
  consider that they were paid via the same entity
  they would be accusing of murder if they said 
  they were gun shots. A clear conflict of interest.

<p>
  Dr. Allard speaks the plane and visible truth 
  when The Post notes that "he says the weapons 
  signatures are so clear as to eliminate all 
  doubt." Also, an ex-CIA agent who was recently 
  interviewed by Dallas Morning News claims that 
  Delta Force agents fired shots at the building.
  A Congressional Committee has recently promised
  him protection from threats against his life.
