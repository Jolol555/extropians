<a name="2113qlink6">I don't see the necessity of competition here.  Surely, it might happen,
though there is a lot of competition between members in the same generation
(in humans) and the same species (both in humans and other species).</a>
Analogously, using the story scenario I descry:), though the cat and the
mouse compete for mouse meat -- the mouse wants to keep its, while the cat
wants to make it a nice meal -- cats also compete with each other for mice
(birds, mates, etc.).

<p>
But, nonetheless, I do see Robert's point.  I plan to make sure I'm always
in the running.  But the best laid plans of humans and posthumans...:)
