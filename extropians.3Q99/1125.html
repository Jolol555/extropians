Nanotechnology isn't a "done deal," but I tend to agree with this last 
statement.  We're more than likely on the verge.  But it's premature speaking 
in absolutes, when a variety of scenarios demand attention.  If we're going 
to discover some alien intelligence in the future, it's _not_ going to be 
through the blinkered reasoning of these last several posts.</a>
