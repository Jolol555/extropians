Fellow extropians,

<p>
To me it seems quite surprising that some of the ideas presented in this
forum are quite relevant to what some Indonesians experience in their
everyday lives. I would like to post a series of messages regarding
phenomenons I have observed, some first handedly and others second handedly.
I surely hope that you can give me scientific explanations for them.

<a name="3493qlink1">  <li>  A Javanese traditonal dance called the "Jaran Kepang" frequently exhibits
tranced dancers who walk over glass shards, eat hard coconut skin and eat
glass shards.</a> There are no visible post trance side effects. I observed the
Jaran Kepang myself, and saw no possible illusion present.
<a name="3493qlink3">In a West Javan ritual, called the "Debus", a gigantic nail is hammered into
a dancer's abdomen, and combustible material is poured and ignited on a
dancer's hair and used to cook eggs. Again, with no visible physical effect.</a>

<a name="3493qlink4">If there are some kind of hynosis involved, I do not understand how glass
shards can be safely digested.</a> I believe there is an unknown scientific
process at work, and if they could be studied there might be medical and
scientific benefits to our society.
