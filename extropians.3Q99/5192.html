<i>&gt; armed cops get killed sometimes) or the problem that women tend to have of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; too afraid to use a weapon.  You don't have to send out the paramedics and waste</i><br>

<p>
Yes, and to get the best of both worlds, you put cameras and audio
gear on all guns (especially those of law enforcement officers). Cameras
have the potential to almost wipe out crime (certainly when combined 
with a fair "swift 'n' sure" justice system, legalization of victimless
crime 
<br>
etc). 

<p>
<a name="5234qlink1">And have you considered the enormous potential of webcams 
(linked to motion detectors)? They could be used for cheap,</a> distributed
surveillance of homes, offices etc. Everyone could watch everyone
else, without compromizing anyone's privacy; when you're at home 
you simply shut off the cam and activate it when you go out. If your 
house is broken into, the people that are in your surveillance ring 
will automatically get a notice and the live images from your home, 
and can then take appropriate measures (call you, call the cops, call
neigborhood vigilantes etc.). 

<p>
If it's a false alarm you see it right away, and no time or money
is wasted. Security firms could use the same system to increase 
their efficiency (and to cut costs -- in fact, almost anyone could
start a security firm this way). All you need is inter/intra (for flats/
neigborhoods) net access (the faster the better, obviously), one 
or more cameras, motion detectors (and perhaps some audio 
gear for good measure) that are all linked to your computer, 
and a simple software program to run the whole thing (so that 
you can alert the proper authorities at the touch of a button 
etc.).

<p>
<a name="5241qlink1">I bet that neigborhoods using this system wouldn't be very
high on any burgular's agenda. The system could of course
be expanded with personal (portable) alarm systems and such.
