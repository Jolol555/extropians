<a name="4501qlink1">From: Stan Kretler
<br>
<a href="4478.html#4482qlink1">&gt; The changes that I see taking place towards the end of this century,</a><br>
<i>&gt; ...seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; nothing other than the logical, historically predicitable, outcome of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the renaissance and the enlightenment...</i><br>
<i>&gt; ...Science improves, and eventually turns its eye</i><br>
<i>&gt; towards the brain, towards artificial brains, and so on. This seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; totally obvious, and was predicted years ago.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4515qlink5"><a href="4478.html#4482qlink2">&gt; I guess my general question would be: What's the big deal? I get the</a><br>
<i>&gt; sense that a lot of what I read here is just cheerleading for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; inevitable. I don't mean to say that it's not very cool stuff being</i><br>
<i>&gt; celebrated. But it's just the train we're on, little more.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4478.html#4482qlink3">&gt; &gt; We should be in the mainstream *while* maintaining our daring</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and original character.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4478.html#4482qlink4">&gt; Another way to ask my question would be: what is it that's daring here?</a></a><br>

<p>
Obviously there is something daring</a> here...or why would you have
<a name="4501qlink2">come...feeling the way you do?</a>  Perhaps it is in knowing that not *every* pc
(that your words have been<a name="4501qlink3"> routed to) lies in front of just one more black
</a>
hole.

<p>
<a name="4501qlink4">And how is all this "inevitable?" The diemaker dies and no one has bothered
to learn hir art because of the inevitableness of it all.</a> Dontcha ever
wonder if you're<a name="4501qlink5"> just another one of those black holes?</a> But, here I am
<a name="4489qlink1">spiking when I shoulda just lobbed.</a>

<p>
C. Tilley...lost in the black hole fractal of hir mind(oops! brain)
