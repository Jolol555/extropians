<a name="2340qlink1">You guys have been reading too many cyberpunk novels.  You can get this sort
of thing to work very erratically (for random virus propogation),</a> and you
<a name="2340qlink2">can usually crack any given system with determined effort from an expert,
but you can't just whip up a magical worm program that does usefull work</a> for
you.

<p>
<a name="2340qlink3">You can get moderately reliable infection mechanisms (since most people
don't have any security), but that doesn't get you anything usefull.</a>  First
<a name="2340qlink4">off, you will be detected and reported within a few weeks at most (by one of
the 0.1% of us who actually use our anti-virus software), and the whole
project will rapidly become public knowledge at that point.  Since the whole
affair is highly illegal (one felony offense for every system the worm
attempts to infect, I believe), this is a big problem.</a>

<p>
<a name="2340qlink5">Beyond that, you are asking for capabilities that would require either
decades of work by some lone genius (and I mean a *real* genius, not some
hacker wannabe), or a billion-dollar R&amp;D investment.  You need secure,

<a name="2340qlink6">low-visibility network traffic across heterogeneous networks</a> (plus
<a name="2340qlink7">firewalls, proxy servers, etc), you need sophisticated multithreaded
computation &amp; spoofing on the infected machines, and you need to invent a
completely new (and extremely complex) scheme for enabling these scattered
programs to coordinate their efforts without a dedicated server to talk to.
</a>
<a name="2340qlink8">Then you want to cram the whole thing into &lt;100KB to make it easy to miss??
Dream on.

<p>
If you can do that, you don't need to compete for some piddling little $100K
prize.  Start your own software business and give Bill a run for his money.
