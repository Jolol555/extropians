<a href="3864.html#3869qlink2">&gt; &gt; I don't know. I would assume you are referring to Wilken's endorsement</a><br>

<i>&gt; No, I was actually refering to a separate thread involving Eliezer</i><br>
<i>&gt; and someone (Elizabeth/Carol/??? -- my mind is losing coherence</i><br>
<i>&gt; at this time) commenting on Eliezer's putative oxymoron about</i><br>
<i>&gt; "unconcious cognition".</i><br>

<p>
Yes, of course! It's interesting how the clarity-checker isn't activated
until you've doomed your thoughts by clicking on that old send button. I
could use an auto-delay in my mail program similar to the one built into
_live_ radio.

<i>&gt; when Eliezer looks into the bowels of his transcendent AI</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sees my face staring out at him.... :-)</i><br>

<p>
Yes. And we will each be standing by with a set of paddles, gleefully
awaiting the opportunity to revive him from his unconscious cognition. Or
was that conscious incognition?</a>

<p>
and here I thought that gods controlled/created their own destiny

Well, I suppose that even your virtual edge is serving it's virtual
purpose.&lt;repressing a smile&gt;
