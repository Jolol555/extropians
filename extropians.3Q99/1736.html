<a href="1728.html#1736qlink1">&gt; I recently had another "What's the Hell's up with this 'post-humanism'</a><br>
<i>&gt; business?!" discussion with some friends of mine who are academics in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanities. Many of them are technophobes, or simply unimaginative when it</i><br>
comes
<br>
<a href="1728.html#1736qlink2">&gt; to the possibilities of human transformation. But their objections to the</a><br>
term
<br>
&gt; "post-humanism" I share. I'm curious what others on this list think about<br>
the
<br>
&gt; following.<br>

<p>
<a name="1765qlink7">Funny you should bring this up.  A few years ago in _KaspahRaster_
(<a href="http://www.teleport.com/~jaheriot/kr.htm">http://www.teleport.com/~jaheriot/kr.htm</a>), there was a debate along the
same lines after my "What is posthumanism?" was published there.

</a>
<p>
<a name="1765qlink8">The debate came down to John J. Funk stating that "posthumanism" is
"posthuman--ism" NOT "post--humanism."  Note the difference in stress.</a>

<p>
<a name="1765qlink6">I tend to think I'd rather have a term that is accurate and shocks some
people than a watered down term that is clunking and hard to pronounce --
merely to try to get some crypto-luddite professors signed on.  Most likely
your academics won't be so easily fooled into accepting our ideas.

</a>
<p>
And do we need them onboard?

<p>
Cheers!
