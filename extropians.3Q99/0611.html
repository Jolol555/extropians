(making all other numbers irrational). For geometry, we have not only
the Platonic Euclidian geometry based on a commonly accepted set of
axioms, but at least two types of non-euclidian geometries which deal
with variations of the parallel theorem. The only possible math areas we
may not know are those used in other space-time continua which use
dimensional systems which have not been deeply explored by current day
graduate students, but every day there is new progress.

that they will communicate via simply understandable maths, much like EO
