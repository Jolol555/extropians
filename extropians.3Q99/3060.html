Yes, years ago, and *in part.*  For me, it's better to read in part, and to
cogitate on each one of the 270 essays.

This makes me think of my talk at Extro 4 and in reference to how the
primal senses for survival.  

<p>
". . . (ancestral) brains perceived patterns and organized large amounts of
information while watching out for predators, pray, enemies or allies.
This type of concentrated awareness was their guidepost for survival.  ...
Like our ancestors, we are in the business of overcoming death.  We tend to
be consciously aware of the mental markers—the hazy feelings of intuition
and insight flashing images and sounds to our brains.  We are watching and
alert, but the details have changed. . . . The concentrated awareness that
develops from the full range and use of our senses develops consciousness.

I think Carl Sagan covered this remarkably in _Demon Haunted World, Science
as a Candle in the Dark_ .  It is such good reading, I refer to it quite
often.
