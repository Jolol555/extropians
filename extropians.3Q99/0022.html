Polyphasic sleep seems like a fun idea (it is often ascribed to
Leonardo da Vinci), although in practice I think the overhead due to
the ~10 minute after-nap sleepiness might decrease efficiency a bit.

Yes, sleep is necessary. I don't know about the frontal lobes (we have
quite big frontal lobes), but memory consolidation and sleep
definitely go hand in hand. My current view of things is that we do
memory consolidation of explicit memories during the deep sleep, and
training of our implicit memories during REM sleep. If you don't get
enough sleep, your memory will work less well. There is more to sleep
than this, but it is a good reason.

<p>
As I see it, a transhuman life is a balance act between the energy of
enthusiasm and the pleasures of sleeping. What a wonderful strain...
