<a name="3537qlink1">Interestingly enough, I think one of my comments, perhaps
on the aging piece, drew a query from someone in Japan
asking "who are you?".   I gave them a short bio, and
asked some questions, but the reply indicated that they
could not reply in English.</a>

<p>
The recent request for documents for translation indicates that
people want these ideas in other languages.

<p>
An interesting idea, perhaps for the new server would be to
setup the pages so they can be run through one of the translation
programs automatically.  We might want to do this with outgoing
mail as well.  I suspect that to do this properly we will need
control of the dictionary.  I'm sure the translation of some
of these concepts into some languages is going to have to be
very creative!

<p>
But as I think I tried to point out at Extro4, we really need to
address getting documents translated.  There are many cultures,
such as Russia and many around the west pacific, that are very
educated, technically literate and don't carry the type of cultural
baggage that will slow acceptance of the ideas in Euro-American regions.

<p>
The only way to make sure that the documents are translated correctly
is to have them done by bi-lingual people familiar with Extropian
concepts or have good translators who are are are able to have extended 
contact with extropians who can discuss the meanings of various concepts.

<p>
Sounds like another project.

<a name="3036qlink1"><a name="3026qlink2">Just to satisfy my curiosity are all of the transhumanist documents
in Sweeden in English?</a>  What about the German efforts?</a>

<p>
One of the interesting grass-roots things that needs to be done
is to identify people who are bi-lingual who have the time and
interest in spreading the concepts from the English-centric
sphere (for example much scientific literature), out to various
cultures where the English speaking fraction is low as well
as returning cultural-specific impressions of ideas, developments,
etc.
