Ok, after being soundly jumped on by Billy, Doug, Phil, Spike, and
probably a whole bunch of people who haven't even read this thread yet,
*I RECANT".  This will teach me to comment on things with incomplete
knowledge without investigating a bit more (maybe :-)).

<p>
I was unaware of the effective ISP for airplanes/helicopters/etc.
and am still not sure I fully understand the reasons for this.
But I'll do some more reading and thinking on the subject.

<p>
<a name="2591qlink1">The lack of a requirement for oxidizer in air-breathing rotors/turbines
would appear to be a big part of the problem.  I was thinking primarily
of the thermodynamic efficiency and assumed that rockets had to be
much better, apparently, not good enough to offset the additional
weight of the oxidizer.</a>  I suspect that rockets will start to
compete with the atomic fuel mentioned in the recent NASA news item
[~4-5x higher than H2/O2 ISP (or perhaps 10x the JetPack's ISP)
I believe].

<p>
So aircars are better because they don't require as much propellent.

<p>
Probably the ideas regarding rocket JetPacks (really Rocket-Packs)
and JoSH's aircars (URL: <a href="http://www.imm.org/Reports/Rep004.html">http://www.imm.org/Reports/Rep004.html</a>)
have been having sex in my mind and been turned into
Air-NanoturbinePacks.  I believe that my original premise
should have said that Air-NanoturbinePacks beat AirCars
for the lower fuel-to-weight ratios.  As others have pointed out
there is a drag problem and you may need a nice pointy ShroudCoat.
At that point I think you have an Air-Nanoturbine-Rocket.

<p>
<a name="2591qlink2">The question becomes, can an Air-Nanoturbine-Rocket launch without
oxidizer and turn itself into an Air-Nanoturbine-Ramjet-Rocket
in the atmosphere on the way up (so you gather the oxidizer
necessary for the final push to orbit above 40,000 ft)?
</a>

<p>
<a name="2591qlink3">And does this get me personal ground-to-orbit transport
for less energy cost than a cross-country trip?
</a>

<p>
And just for comparison purposes... Can I harvest the CO2
and H2O out of the atmosphere to build myself a nice
plastic/diamond cable reinforced ballon and fill it with H2
and "float" part of the way up for an even cheaper ride?
I.e. is the energy cost to harvest materials &amp; construct the
balloon cheaper than the energy cost of the fuel to get to the
same height?

of production volumes.  If we could produce the fuel-cell cars

fuel cell materials (e.g. platinum), but these are either solved
now or could be solved by recycling.
