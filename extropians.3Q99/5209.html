 Further, is sublimation a requirement of art? If it is, will
 science's ability to give us direct fulfillment of our needs
 eliminate art? &gt;&gt;

<a name="5231qlink3">Actually, the reason i didn;t coment wasn't your oneliner--  it was funny at 
first. I laughed out loud, but the reason I have nothing to say about 
sublimation causing art is pretty simple:

</a><p>
I don't believe in it.

<a name="5231qlink4">I never bought that, but I had to study that stuff in college. And I have 
Jungian therapist pals who believe in myth and collective consciousness too, 
and that also seems sketchy..</a> but more appealing...  dreams, etc...
<a name="5231qlink5">Anywayz........   there's no evidence in my personal experience  that we 
artists sublimate in order to create. I think that in Freud's time, Victorian 
times,  that may have held credence, I dunno, but i was a creature without 
that social pressure to conform- and/or sublimate my desires, I have pretty 
much done as I please all my life, and I still create.</a> So I didn't comment 
becasue I really have no opinion.


<p>
I do think Balzac was a detail freak, and drank way way WAY too much coffee.. 
but other than that...

good work, it does feel very much like a tantric version of sexual union.</a> But 
that's just good NRG flow, happens in bodybuilding too)
