I was estimating the effort required to write the program in C++, or some
other language at a similar level of abstraction.  Obviously the way out of
the trap is move to a higher-level description of the program.

<p>
However, reducing something of this complexity to a manageable amount of
code is going to require extremely high levels of abstraction.  I can reduce
human-written LOC by about an order of magnitude by moving from C++ to a
modern high-level language, and I can maybe get the another factor of 20-50
out of special-purpose code generators.  To get much beyond that we have to
start inventing new techniques, which is what I think should be a major
research focus of software engineering for the immediate future.

<p>
I would expect, BTW, that reaching the information density of DNA will take
several levels of abstraction beyond what you suggest.  DNA is best compared
to a program that modifies itself, the rules of the language it is written
in, and the architecture of the machine that it runs on, all at the same
time.  It seems to me that unfolding a strange loop like that into a simple
hierarchy, as we would have to do in order to get a useable programming
language, would require imbedding a near-sentient degree of intelligence
into the programming tools. Since we can't code an AI of that complexity by
hand, we're back to needing to build the tools to build the tools to build
the tools.

<p>
Which would simply be an invigorating challenge, if only our industry wasn't
so dominated by people who are content with languages that are older than
they are...
