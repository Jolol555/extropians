Ya, what I actually had in mind was a kind of ride-along metamind
that would be operating on a much faster timescale than humans do.
Perhaps this metamind was what told Obiwan's master that Jar Jar
was about to do that rude lizard tongue thing at the dinner table.
(Recall the force-filled Jedi guy moved so fast he was able to grab
Binks' tongue in mid-apple-snatch-maneuver.)

If we had these nanoneurons on the surface of a few mitochondria,
they could form a nanoscale community that would not interfere in
any way with our normal behaviour, any more than ants interfere in
the lives of elephants.  If we managed to convince this nanocommunity
to work with us on our scale, observing our world and sending up
to our minds intuitions and ideas, this forms (sorta-kinda) a technological
explanation of THE FORCE.  In return, we would provide them
with a nice environment, food, protection, raw material, etc.  spike
