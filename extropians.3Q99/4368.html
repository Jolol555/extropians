Anti-discrimation laws and privacy laws, are an obstacle here.  Right now people
segregated by how much they spend on housing.  And this has the perverse effect
of forcing poor people to chose between living in the same neighborhoods as
dangerous criminals, or spending 50% of their income on rent.

Yes, there are all kinds of factors that would end up being used to discriminate
against people.  If you had a choice, you might well decide not to let wife
beaters in.  It would be like a small towns where everyone knows everyone else,
and people act accordingly. OJ Simpson has big problems because everyone knows
who he is and what he did, and frequently avoid contact with him.  He already is
in a prison without wall.
