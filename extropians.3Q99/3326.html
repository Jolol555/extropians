<p>
Why?  Right now almost all of that energy is ultimately converted to heat
and radiated back into space.  If we intercept some of it for industrial
uses first, that has no effect at all on the total generation of heat.

<p>
OK, sure, if we put all of the factories in one big pile we'll probably
create some nasty side effects, but we don't particularly want to do that
anyway.  Spreading out our radiation of waste heat to approximate natural
conditions is a much smaller problem than building all those solar power
collectors in the first place.

<p>
I think you can reasonably conclude that nanotech makes the global climate a
resource that must be actively managed and protected, just like deep sea
fisheries are today.  However, that does not mean that the problems involved
are insoluble (or even particularly difficult, given the technology you are
already assuming).

<p>
<a href="3173.html#3326qlink2">&gt; &gt; Those numbers work out to 5.7x10^4 KW per person, modeling the earth as</a><br>
a
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; disk of the given radius, facing the sun.  But the earth's population is</i><br>
<a href="3173.html#3326qlink3">&gt; &gt; now reported to be 6 billion rather than 3 billion.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; We must be using different calculators because when I take</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Insolation*Pi*R_earth^2 / 6*10^9</i><br>
<i>&gt; I get 2.93*10^7.</i><br>

<p>
Well, let's see:
<pre>
1) Total area of a disk with radius 6.37*10^9 m:  1.3x10^14 m^2
2) Total solar energy striking said disk at 1374 W/m^2: 1.7x10^17
3) Divide by 6 billion people: 2.9x10^7 W per capita
4) Convert to KW: 2.5x10^4 KW per capita

</pre>
<p>
So our only disagreement was how many people have to split the pie.

<p>
Now, the claim I was disputing was that energy expenditures greater than
10^4 W per capita would significantly affect the Earth's heat balance.  Even
if it were all new energy (from nuclear fusion, for instance), this amount
seems too low (only 0.1% of the current energy flow) to have such drastic
effects.   I'm sure it would have significant climatological effects if it
is released indiscriminately, but cooking the planet is another story
altogether.

<p>
<a href="3173.html#3326qlink4">&gt; I would generally agree with Hal, in that I think we can get almost</a><br>
<i>&gt; an order of magnitude more power without too much trouble.</i><br>
<i>&gt; More than that and it is going to start creating problems</i><br>
<i>&gt; until we have a lot of computer power to simulate the potential</i><br>
<i>&gt; effects.</i><br>

<p>
Which, of course, is one of the very first things that nanotech would give
us.  For that matter, we'll probably have the horsepower to tackle the
global climate well before molecular manufacturing becomes practical.

<p>
<a href="3173.html#3326qlink5">&gt; But I suspect you can get probably 2-4 orders of magnitude</a><br>
<i>&gt; better by doing more efficient assembly (i.e. chemical reactions</i><br>
<i>&gt; that utilize/reuse the free energy effectively), reusing building</i><br>
<i>&gt; blocks (so once you have invested in building them, you don't rebuild</i><br>
<i>&gt; them) and going to more efficient nanodesigns.  So we are probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; wasting mental energy on the wrong side of the problem.</i><br>

<p>
Yes.  Besides, in this kind of slow-AI/fast-nanotech scenario I see very
little chance of Earth having a large active population of humans for long
enough to make these issues significant.  Those who want to do big things in
physical space will migrate out into the solar system, where the resources
and breathing room they need are plentiful.  Those who are happy with VR
will tend to live in it, which leaves them with very modest needs in the
physical world.  The number of humans who need to divide Earth's physical
resources is likely to be quite modest - maybe a few tens of millions - and
I'd expect a large percentage of them to be back-to-nature types, which furt
her reduces their energy needs.
