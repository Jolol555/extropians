<a href="3988.html#4081qlink1">&gt;I've always found it odd that immigrants have to take a course on</a><br>
<i>&gt;American History, the Constitution, and how our government works</i><br>
<i>&gt;before you get your citizenship, but I doubt that more than 50% of</i><br>
<i>&gt;high schools in the country still offer the same coursework, so</i><br>
<i>&gt;naturally born kids never learn this stuff... I say have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;standardized nationwide test that all Americans have to take to</i><br>
<i>&gt;earn the right to vote, etc. You should only be a citizen if you</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually know, understand, and ACCEPT the values and mechanisms by</i><br>
<i>&gt;which our government operates. Take the same vow to "protect and</i><br>
<i>&gt;defend the Constitution of the United States from all enemies,</i><br>
<i>&gt;foreign AND domestic," that immigrants and military officers and</i><br>
<i>&gt;enlistees take.</i><br>

<p>
Here in Illinois you have to take and pass a constitution test to
graduate from grammar school (at least you used to.) it was very
tough as I recall. It wouldn't be a bad idea if PBS ran a show or
two every year to help educate people on this very subject.

<p>
I like the part about taking the oath, reminds me of "Starship
Troopers" (the book) where only veterans could vote...... that
certainly would have kept clinton out......

<p>
<a name="4089qlink1">"Starship Troopers" was the book that convinced me</a> to enlist
(U.S.M.C.) back in '74.
