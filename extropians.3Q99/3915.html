One big flaw I see with it is the noise level produced.. you likely

landed at your house in the burbs. It will only be from airport to
airport transport unless something changes.</a>

<a href="3913.html#3915qlink1">&gt; Hello everyone,</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I listened to an Art Bell show several months ago where Dr. Moller spoke</i><br>
<i>&gt; about his skycar.  He answered to my total satisfaction every question put</i><br>
<i>&gt; to him regarding his craft.  Whether the concerns were about the computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; that flew it, aerodynamics, air safety, cost or insurance rates he seemed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; have everything in hand.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I wonder what list members think of his skycar?  Is it really everything he</i><br>
<i>&gt; makes it out to be?  He even admits that the one million dollar price tag</i><br>
<i>&gt; would only go down if it could be mass-produced.  But then in a decade or</i><br>
<i>&gt; less the price would be in the realm of a mid-priced automobile!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm hoping to be jetting around in my own moller skycar in about fifteen</i><br>
<i>&gt; years time!  I hope it is not too good to be true.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sincerely,</i><br>
