<a href="3745.html#3749qlink1">&gt; Doesn't it seem though that there must be more to it than that? You need some way of forgetting or pruning the past or you'll drown in irrelevant detail. I’m reminded of a (possibly apocryphal) anecdote about a mental patient with a photographic memory who couldn’t tell whether there was a glass on his bedside table, or he was remembering the one that was there yesterday.</a><br>

In _Coding a Transhuman AI_, I argue that a useful system of symbols and
memory requires context-sensitive reconstruction from (some presumably
more compact) coding, not just reloading a precise recording of the last
set of data structures.  For example, if "cat" just loads in a picture
of every cat I've ever seen, how do I imagine a "purple cat"?  And once
that infrastructure is in place - in fact, I suspect that the
infrastructure evolved that way to begin with - the tremendous storage
capacity necessary to store precise images doesn't seem worth the
evolutionary candle.

<p>
The legendary theory that all memories are stored subconsciously seems
to me like obvious bull.  I recall, for example, the experiment showing
that (gaussian) women are better than (gaussian) men at memorizing the
location of objects, either relative or in spatial arrays; 70% better if
you're testing casual, rather than deliberate, memory.  I'm not getting
into gender politics, but I do want to point out that a differential
selection pressure implies a selection pressure, and one strong enough
to get a 70% performance improvement;<a name="3753qlink1"> if we really have perfect memories
stored, why haven't such selection pressures resulted</a> in perfect performance?
