<a name="1483qlink1">I saw the first in a series of 8 of these last week.  It was about the
quirky human fascination with time-saving devices.  Like how orange juice
went from being packaged in a half gallon paper container</a> with the tear open
<a name="1483qlink2">side to a container with a twist off cap on the side to a container with a
pull-tab opener.  Another example was how manufacturers of cd players were
now including a feature where one can reduce the usual 3 seconds between
songs down to 1 second.  Why wait?  You have better things to do with your
time!  I'm not so sure we're as fascinated with saving time as we are
manipulated by corporate product managers who feed on our obvious</a> desire for
<a name="1483qlink3">"new and improved" products.  Ted Koppel made a paternal-like appearance at
the end of the show and voiced his opinion that we are caught in a
technological tyranny.</a>

<p>
The show was produced in a somewhat more entertaining fashion than other
versions of Primetime, but was seriously lame in parts.  Still, they intend
on devoting some of their future shows to superstring theory, the liklihood
of human extinction, and some other topics that sounded fairly interesting.

<p>
Cheers,
