<p>
Mechanic devices (tapes, mechanic disk drives, CDs, etc.) require more time
to perform an operation than electrical or pure-magnetic devices do, as they
move _atoms_ around.  A DRAM device moves _electrons_.  Electrons require much
less power to move around, as they occupy less space, have much smaller mass,
and have a non-zero charge so one can use electrical fields to move them.

<p>
So if one compares mechanical devices to a DRAM device,
one, figuratively writing, compares apples and nuclear submarines.

<p>
Comparing various solid-state devices (like DRAMs and flash disks) make
more sense (the comparisons have greater information contents).
