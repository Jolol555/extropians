OK, I understand that point.  But given that most genes have multiple 
regulators there will be several potential targets.  Six regulatory regions
with 2 potential mutations each gives 12 targets.  If any are negative 
repressors that goes up.

<p>
With a successful wild herbivorous species, you will have hundreds of
thousands of individuals for hundreds of thousands of generations.  Even
at a typical mutation rate of 10 per billion nuceotides per generation,
each mutation will recur hundreds or thousands of times.  So there
have been plenty of memory upregulator mutations for natural selection
to play with.  From an evolutionary viewpoint, it's not rare at all.

<p>
Availability of mutations is an issue for top carnivores and geographically
restricted species but we're talking mice here :-)

Currently we do know of more eukaryotic promotors than 
repressors, but there are still lots of repressors.  That's all I said.
My textbook actually claimed that virtually all eukaryotic regulators
were promotors but when I went to the literature to look at the 
evolution of regulation I found that wasn't the case.
