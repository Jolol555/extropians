<i>&gt;All the politicians are trying to claim they are for both creationism and</i><br>
<i>&gt;evolution.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;From Fox News Online:</i><br>
<i>&gt;__________</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gore Shocks Scientists With Creationism Statement</i><br>
<i>&gt;            4.31 p.m. ET (2033 GMT) August 26, 1999</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; WASHINGTON  statement from his office that local school boards had the</i><br>
right to
<br>
<i>&gt;teach</i><br>
<i>&gt; creationism, although he personally favored the teaching of evolution. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "The vice president favors the teaching of evolution in public schools.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Obviously,</i><br>
<i>&gt; that decision should and will be made at the local level and localities</i><br>
should
<br>
<i>&gt;be</i><br>
<i>&gt; free to decide to teach creationism as well,'' said Alejandro Cabrera, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; spokesman in the vice president's office. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The statement, in response to an inquiry from Reuters, came a week after</i><br>
<i>&gt; Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush supported the</i><br>
teaching of
<br>
<i>&gt; creationism in public schools alongside the theory of evolution. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; When told of Gore's statement, Eugenie Scott, executive director of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;National</i><br>
<i>&gt; Center for Science Education, responded: "My God, that's appalling!'' </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "I understand politicians like to compromise and that faced with one</i><br>
group who
<br>
<i>&gt; say two plus two equals four and another group that says two plus two equals</i><br>
<i>&gt;six,</i><br>
<i>&gt; will tend to arrive at a position that says two plus two equals five.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Unfortunately,</i><br>
<i>&gt; sometimes the answer has to be four and this is one of those times,'' she</i><br>
said. 
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bush, the governor of Texas who leads the field for the Republican</i><br>
presidential
<br>
<i>&gt; nomination by a wide margin, said last week in New Orleans he favored</i><br>
exposing
<br>
<i>&gt; children to different theories of how life began. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "I believe children ought to be exposed to different theories about how the</i><br>
<i>&gt;world</i><br>
<i>&gt; started,'' Bush said, in response to a question about a decision earlier</i><br>
this
<br>
<i>&gt;month</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the Kansas Board of Education to delete virtually any mention of</i><br>
evolution
<br>
<i>&gt; from the state's recommended science curriculum and standardized tests. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Bush's spokeswoman Mindy Tucker said: "He (Bush) believes both creationism</i><br>
<i>&gt; and evolution ought to be taught. He believes it is a question for states</i><br>
and
<br>
<i>&gt;local</i><br>
<i>&gt; school boards to decide but he believes both ought to be taught.'' </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Harvard University chemistry professor Dudley Herschbach said he was shocked</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the Gore and Bush statements and found them very disappointing. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "It ought to be the birthright of our children to be taught honest</i><br>
science that
<br>
<i>&gt;is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; tangled up with politics and religion,'' he said. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Evolution, first set forth by the 19th century scientist Charles Darwin,</i><br>
is the
<br>
<i>&gt;theory</i><br>
<i>&gt; that because there are certain similarities in all forms of life on</i><br>
Earth, that
<br>
<i>&gt;all life</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolved from common ancestors. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Opponents of the theory say it contradicts the biblical account of the</i><br>
creation
<br>
<i>&gt;of</i><br>
<i>&gt; life by God and object to the notion that human life evolved from a lower</i><br>
life
<br>
<i>&gt; form. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Francisco Ayala, a geneticist at the University of California, Irvine,</i><br>
said the
<br>
<i>&gt; United States was making itself a laughing stock in the world. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "If we don't teach our kids good science, they will be handicapped later</i><br>
in a
<br>
<i>&gt; world that depends on science and technology,'' he said. "I am disturbed at</i><br>
<i>&gt;this</i><br>
<i>&gt; political trend. It is potentially terribly damaging to our children.'' </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Among other Republican presidential candidates, publisher Steve Forbes and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Sen. John McCain of Arizona both said the decision of what to teach in</i><br>
schools
<br>
<i>&gt; should be left to local authorities and took no position on the issue. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Conservative Pat Buchanan said he supported teaching children that the</i><br>
universe
<br>
<i>&gt; was created by God, although he did not object to them learning about</i><br>
evolution
<br>
<i>&gt; as a theory. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "What I do object to is to teach Darwin's theory of evolution of human</i><br>
beings
<br>
<i>&gt; from animals without divine intervention. I don't believe in that and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;adamantly</i><br>
<i>&gt; object to that,'' he told Reuters in a telephone message. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Republican candidate Gary Bauer, who is vying with Buchanan for the</i><br>
support of
<br>
<i>&gt; conservatives, said on MSNBC: "Polling data shows Americans want both ideas</i><br>
<i>&gt; exposed to children. I think that makes a lot of sense.'' </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Barry Lynn of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the</i><br>
<i>&gt; issue was becoming a litmus test for some conservative Christians who were a</i><br>
<i>&gt; powerful constituency in the Republican Party. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "When we have candidates saying we ought to turn public schools into Sunday</i><br>
<i>&gt; schools, we have a big problem,'' he said.</i><br>
