<a name="4809qlink1">     I don't know of any correlation between urban environment and serial 
killers.  I think a much more significant trend has been the increase in 
mobility in American society.  while I do not believe that this necessarily 
has increased the number of serial killers, it has probably allowed the 
organized (more sociopathic versus psychopathic) serial killers to operate 
longer before capture.  As for the connection between hunting and decreased 
level of serial killing, I also know of no connection.</a>

<p>
<a name="4809qlink2">     Correlations I do know of in serial killers:  As children, they tend to 
do two or more of the following; set fires, torture animals, continue to wet 
beds late in childhood.  The first two are thought to relate to a fascination 
with power, destruction, and a disregard for others.  That reminds me of 
another large factor in the make-up of a serial killer, depersonalization of 
the victim.  There is a slighter correlation between serial killers and abuse 
in the home (i.e., several serial killers come from backgrounds of neglect 
and/or violence, but only very, very few people raised in neglect and/or 
violence ever become serial killers).  Serial killers tend to be fantasy 
driven, starting out with a violent fantasy through which they feel powerful, 
over time the fantasy builds, becoming more elaborate.  The serial killer 
will reach a point where imagining is no longer enough, so they begin to act 
out their fantasy, often starting with simulated activity, then moving</a> on to 
animals.  If not stopped, they continue to increase the level of violence and 
the type of target evolves.  This is both because the serial killer gains in 
sophistication through practice and finds that he needs greater levels of 
violence and/or more difficult targets to gain the same thrill.  Oftentimes 
they will make the switch from animals to humans, starting with assaults, 
then serial rapes, then finally murder.  Also, they may start with children 
and work up to adults.

<p>
     Interestingly, recent studies have suggested that violent crime is not 
related to urban vs rural differences, socioeconomic status, or ethnic 
background, but rather the values and sense of family within neighborhoods.  
In those neighborhoods where people know each other, where it is considered 
the responsibility of all adults to look out for the neighborhood kids, these 
were the ones with the lowest violent crime rates.  The main study showing 
this was one done of the area in and around Chicago.

<p>
<a name="4809qlink3">     Also, I would suggest that it is not the frequency or severity of 
punishment which most strongly effects crime rates, but rather the certainty 
and consistency of punishment.  Few people commit crimes with the expectation 
of being punished (with the exception of those who do it as some sort of 
protest or statement).
