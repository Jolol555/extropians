<p>
I've spent an hour or so trying to track down sources without much
luck, but from what I recall from discussions on sci.space.tech the
problem is turning *off* the current.  V=Ldi/dt, and a large
negative di/dt is a bitch to terminate- like opening a circuit
breaker carrying a large DC current.  Big sizzling arcs... A big
inductor with a large current flowing through it (ie lots of stored
energy) tries to be an ideal current source.

<p>
The ideal current profile in a stator coil is a square wave, going
high when the bucket is about one coil diameter away, then dropping
to zero as the bucket reaches the plane of the coil.  This gives the
bucket a good pull, and doesn't need maglev guideways. More
realistically, you might get a roughly linear ramp up &amp; ramp down
with a Bi-FET driver switch and bridge diodes- the switch closes
when the bucket is one diameter away, opens at 1/2 diameter, and the
diodes divert the negative spike back into the supply capacitor. 
The cap driving each stage is oversized so that it approximates a
constant voltage supply.  When the coil current goes to zero, the
diodes stop conducting, and the switch never sees more than 2x the
drive voltage.

<p>
Coils at the high speed end would still need to have fewer turns and
higher currents, to dump the stored charge faster- the total energy
delivered to the bucket is the same for each coil (if acceleration
is constant) but the time available for the current pulse goes as
1/v.

Maybe after tomorrow morning... Rotary is supposed to fly the ATV in
a hover test, then safe the system, put it away, close the doors,
and send home everybody that's left.  It's sad to see it go out with
a whimper.
