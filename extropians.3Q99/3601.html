Reality sure is funny stuff...

I answered this question to my own satisfaction in 1994 when our first
Worlds program actually worked...especially when we included the softbot
with extensive knowledge of bartending.<a name="3604qlink3"> The answer is: a virtual world is an
actual world under all conditions<a name="3605qlink3"> where the simulated cognitives are unaware
that their world is a simulation.</a> Once interior consciousness is available,
</a>
it is real. I have been aware that we are a simulation since 1994. Yet, a
simulation is real where consequences are real/cared about. Consciousness is
the only REAL thing...(that I know of). I invite you to visit
www.activeworlds.com which is one of the companies resulting from Worlds
Inc.<a name="3620qlink1"> Thus, my conclusion is that whether a world is simulated on a
hypersupermegametacompumaniac...or a balsa wood abacus of sufficient
complexity...it's still a real world.</a>
