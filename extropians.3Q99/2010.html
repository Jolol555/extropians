In Feb. of 1989, Nanocon was held here in Seattle, with 70 attending. (I'm
sure times and people change/move) But you just may be right about a need
for these get togethers. (It would be fun to see what we could come up with
in regular brainstorming sessions!)
<br>
I will post a request for any others in the area with your idea's on my
nanotech@onelist.com
<br>
email list, and get back to you recieve responses.
I would be glad to help in any other way, feel free to ask me.

<a href="1961.html#2010qlink1">&gt;Seeing Dave's recent list of the EI lists and my recent encounters</a><br>
<i>&gt;with a few Seattle people at various ExI/Foresight conferences</i><br>
<i>&gt;leads me to the conclusion that we need an exi-northwest list.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Could people from the Seattle/Portland/Vancouver region send</i><br>
<i>&gt;me an email if they want to opt-in to such a list.  One of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the things that I would like to do is begin to organize</i><br>
<i>&gt;quarterly/bi-monthly/monthly (?) get togethers for idea</i><br>
<i>&gt;sharing, perhaps intimate discussions with authors, etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'd also like to float a group project in putting together</i><br>
<i>&gt;course materials for discussions about Nanotech/Extropy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;One thing that was clear from the Bioastronomy conference</i><br>
<i>&gt;is the desire that science teachers have for ideas that</i><br>
<i>&gt;will inspire their students.  I think we have those</i><br>
<i>&gt;falling out of our brains in great excess.</i><br>
