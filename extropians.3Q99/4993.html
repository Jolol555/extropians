<p>
<a name="4997qlink1">I've always construed the intent of Crocker's Rules as a personal
</a>
declaration of personal responsibility for personal reactions.  I don't
say:  "I can say anything I want to anyone, and if they take offense,
it's their fault."  I say:  "Anyone can say anything they want to me,
and if I take offense, it's my fault."

<p>
This declaration is neither altruistic, nor is it based on expectation
of reciprocity - it is to my advantage to have other people be able to
communicate with me in minimum time, or to communicate unpleasant truths.

<p>
<a name="4998qlink1">Two people operating under Crocker's Rules should be able to exchange
visualizations in minimum time and with minimum effort, so there *is* a
networking effect.<a name="4997qlink2">  We can hope that this mental discipline will
eventually spread, and drive out the sick culture of "manners" and
"politeness" based on social dominance, politics, fear of retribution,
</a>
and the desire to avoid trouble.
</a>

<p>
I do declare myself to be operating under Crocker's Rules, by the way.
