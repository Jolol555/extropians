Well, that swagger stance would get uncomfortable in a hurry- I wrote to
solotrek a month ago, suggesting a set of footpegs inboard of the vehicle's
<a name="4471qlink2">legs.  The photos of the prototype showed a *huge* control authority- large
pitch motions of the fans, both collectively and differential, could induce
excessive rates.  Think of a car with powersteering that goes lock to lock
</a>
in half a turn- or a bumper car for that matter- twitchy!  The technogabble
about retinal scanners to lock out unauthorized users seems silly, a key
should work just fine.

<p>
<a name="4471qlink3">Even with those fairly large fans, the power demand will be very high, and
weightlifting capacity limited.  I think the greatest liability is the lack
</a>
of intuitive body english steering, the difference between skydiving and
piloting a plane.

<p>
Consider: mini helicopters with ~15 foot rotor disks are easier &amp; cheaper
to build, safer (they can autorotate), and have less problems with rotor
wash (small area implies higher downwash velocity).

<p>
It would be a neat toy, though :)
