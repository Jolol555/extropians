<a name="0888qlink1">I was talking about using a _preexisting_ space technology.  Note the word 
</a>"retrofitting."<a name="0888qlink2">  Obviously the shuttle, as is, is not an ideal interplanetary 
craft, but there are a number of modifications that could make it worth a 
lunar flight.</a>  Stephen Baxter, in his novel "Titan," shows how shuttle 
technology could be modified for a trip to Saturn (!).  It's science fiction, 
but well within what is possible (in the book, a modified shuttle is used 
because NASA is essentially bankrupt).
