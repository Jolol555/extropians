<a name="2816qlink1"><a name="2745qlink1">The reason I brought up the socialist idea was to learn what most of you 
thought about the idea and thought about government.  I myself enjoy freedom 
and despise any and all forceful government.</a>

<p>
<a name="2745qlink2">When I wrote the post I was thinking about government funds used to 
advertise donations to schools.

<p>
Schools would then provide a free education to students as well as provide 
free housing and medical.  In return the students would contribute to 
society by gaining "useful" employment and contributing to economics.</a></a>

<p>
On another more serious matter I'm against taxes.  Taxes are only 
enforceable by force and so I'm against it.

<p>
Instead, I propose that the government find other ways of making money to 
"serve" its citizens. Perhaps making its money by providing protection to 
other countries, or as a world mediator?  There have to be other ways for a 
government that serves its people to make money.
Unless there are people here who believe that a government should be served 
instead of serving?

<p>
<a name="2716qlink1">It is my opinion that government should protect its citizens,</a> nothing more.  
<a name="2716qlink2">It should be possible for a government to work without taxing its people.

<p>
Can we formulate some ideas on how this can be accomplished.  Would it be 
desirable?  Remember that nanotechnology can create some very</a> scary weapons 
<a name="2716qlink3">that can make an undesirable government incredibly strong!</a>
