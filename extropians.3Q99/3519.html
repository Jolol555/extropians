GM food 'more worrying than BSE'

</a>
<p>
20% of adults would not give their families GM tomatoes

<p>
Genetically-modified food has overtaken BSE as the top food safety issue for
nearly half the UK public, a survey has said.  And almost a third of those
interviewed said they did not feel they could trust the government on food
safety issues.

<p>
  The public has grown more opposed to GM technology over the past year,
said Mintel, who carried out a survey of 1,000 adults.

<p>
Some 47% believe that GM food is the most pressing food safety concern,
compared with 36% in 1998.

<p>
The BBC's Karen Bowerman reports

<p>
Only 36% said they considered BSE to be the over-riding food safety issue.

<p>
The research suggested that GM farm-scale trials and worries over food
labelling have hardened opinion against GM foods.

<p>
BSE's knock-on effect

<p>
One-fifth of the adults interviewed said they were so fearful of GM food
they would never knowingly eat it or give it to their family.

<p>
Women were more worried about GM food than men, with more than 50%
registering concern. And 53% of Londoners were unhappy about it, compared
with 38% of Scots.

<p>
Three-quarters of those surveyed said GM foods should be clearly labelled,
while 37% called for more research into the technology.

<p>
Some 47% said they felt they did not know enough about the technology to
make an informed judgement.

<p>
Researchers said people felt they had been lied to over BSE, and this was
having a knock-on effect on the general attitude to GM foods.

<p>
"Memories of the BSE crisis will continue to beset the efforts of
biotechnology companies in their efforts to develop GM foods," said James
McCoy, Mintel's senior consultant on consumer goods.
