What fun!  This game reminds me of the game we played in the politicial
science department, where you try to parse out the line of succession in
the US government as, one by one, the successors get asassinated.  I forget
the number of successors, it's quite large, maybe Chris can remember.

<p>
In reality, when there is an address made by the US President to the
Congress (such as a State of the Union address), it means that all of the
successors are in one room at the same time.  So, one person in the cabinet
is designated to stay home that evening so as to avoid a situation where,
say, the Architect of the Capitol has to assume any power.
