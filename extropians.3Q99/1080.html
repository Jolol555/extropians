<p>
I tend to think so, but since we've no examples of such, this is all
speculation.  I also wonder if it would even be necessarilty to get
materials from planets at all.  My guess is that when you needed materials,
you can finds hunks of rock and ice or just gather some dust and gas -- if
recycling won't do the trick.

Why even travel from star to star?  Why not, instead stay in the less messy
areas between stars, even between galaxies?

<p>
Maybe, but all of this is predicated on an advanced species somehow being
unified.  Even on Earth, we have nations, regions, communities, and
individuals who do not go with the overall flow.  For instance, I heard a
news story yesterday (on NPR, I believe) about how the Amish (an American
religious group based mostly in Pennsylvania, USA) doubles its population
every 20 years.  That's an incredibly high rate.  Granted, the Amish are not
the cutting edge technologically, but I can imagine an advanced species
having its subgroups doing stuff like that.

<p>
I generally agree.  Of course, with increased ability, usually people want
to do even more.  Hence, we see people who are not just happy having all the
things their parents or grandparents had for less.  I certainly want much
more than the around 100 years life span current tech might give me!:)

<p>
I don't know.  I think we can work with less than perfect solutions and even
more advanced societies will have their problems.  I'm sure what will
probably happen is in many cases postbiological existence.  In others,
biological systems might be adapted to deal with messes much better.  In
still others, perhaps better ways of exploiting resources might come about
for those who wish to adapt the system to them rather than vice versa.  And
I'm sure their will be solutions mixing these or even outside of these.
