<a name="0034qlink1">Today I ate lunch in Marlene's, our local health food store.</a>

<p>
One one side of the store there is a juice bar, complete with fresh 
wheatgrass, and on the other side, an expresso bar.

<p>
As I drank my Jerimiah's Julep (a carob/spirulina/yogurt shake), I 
mentioned in jest to the guy behind the expresso bar that I was a CIA 
android created as a spoiler for the 2000 Presidential election.  He 
just twitched a smile and said he knew that a month ago.

<p>
In any case, one of the female attendants mentioned that some 
customers were asking about converting the place to an internet cafe. 
All Marlene could do was shake her head:  "No.  I have no interest in 
the internet.  It's too complicated.  It's not for me."

<p>
<a name="0034qlink2">It's her customers I'm thinking about.  How to get reasonable 
internet access from a table in Marlene's cafe?  Flashbacks: NT 
Server with DSL connection: Proxy Server: DHCP Server: RJ-45 jacks.

<p>
An then, some common sense.

<p>
How about something simple?  For Marlene, and the whole vertical 
market she represents...

<p>
For now, at the end of the copper era, maybe a transition strategy:

<p>
DSL in one end: wireless DHCP within 50 feet of the expresso machine. 
 Get a PCMCIA card for your laptop, come in and enjoy the wheatgrass!

<p>
<a name="0037qlink1">Can this be done?  And please don't give me any bullshit about 
proxy/firewall software and billable outlets!  Marlene wants 
simplicity or nothing at all.</a></a>
