        Actually, from what I remember from a conversation with Paul Wakfer
at Extro-3, Saul Kent (who attended) was potentially going give some
funding to Paul's Prometheus Project, a cryonics-based project.  However, I
haven't heard any word about the progress of the Prometheus Project (or for
that matter, anything from Paul Wakfer) for well over a year.  It is
unfortunate, as I found that project very promising.

<p>
        The idea of major league funding is very crucial to the progress of
technology in general.  Personally, more than any other extropic
organization, I would like to see the Foresight Institute get decent
financial backing.  It seems to be the organization with its feet planted
firmly in present day reality, and seeing the possibilities of that reality
implemented in a not-so distant future.

<p>
        Keep searching for those self-made men...
