*Vision chip blends detection with image processing<br>
(4:25 p.m. EDT, 08/03/99)
<br>
Blending an array of photo-detectors with on-chip digital image-processing
circuits, researchers at the University of Tokyo have created an ultrafast
sensor for industrial applications. The vision chip both acquires and
processes images at 1,000 frames per second, enabling a robot arm equipped
with a prototype sensor to grab for fast-moving objects without calculating
trajectories.

CHAMPAIGN, Ill. -- The recent discovery of the rare radioactive isotope

*DNA To Help Nab Drug Dealers Red-Handed - Report<br>
LONDON (Reuters) - A new test based on DNA science can tell if people have
handled cannabis, but it is so sensitive that there are fears that innocent
people could be incriminated, the New Scientist said Wednesday. It said
researchers had identified DNA sequences within the part of the plant cell
responsible for photosynthesis -- the chloroplast -- which are specific to
cannabis sativa and are not found in any other species. The discovery by
researchers at the University of Strathclyde in Glasgow makes it possible to
take a swab from someone's hands and test it for the cannabis DNA
sequences.``This test is as sensitive as you can ever get,'' Adrian Linacre,
one of the inventors, told New Scientist. ''Theoretically, it could pick up
the presence of just one molecule of cannabis DNA.''
Because the test multiplies the amount of DNA, it works on minute samples,
unlike existing techniques. But this acute sensitivity is causing concern.
Chris Evans, of Surescreen Diagnostics which markets drug testing kits, said
the test could easily trap the innocent.``If you have been driving a
second-hand car and a previous owner has been using cannabis, you could get
enough on your hands to test positive,'' he told the magazine. Bank notes
could also carry trace amounts of the drug.
Linacre said he had calibrated the test so that only relatively large
quantities of DNA gave positive results. He is now developing the test to
detect the DNA profiles of different strains of cannabis, such as those
grown in South Africa or Thailand. ``We will be able to use genetic evidence
to link different batches of cannabis and trace them back to their original
source,'' he said.

*Audio Eclipse May Fill the Sky - As the eclipse turns day into night over<br>
Europe on August 11, radio transmissions from near the path of totality may
spread across the globe, due to ionospheric changes caused by the Moon's
shadow. As a result, ham radio operators around the world can track the
August 11, 1999 total solar eclipse by monitoring changes in atmospheric
radio propagation.

*A GameBoy, GameBoy Pocket, or GameBoy Color has software available with the<br>
ability to turn your GameBoy into a RedBox (Toll Fraud Device) This software
has been around for a while. These GUI based applications allow you use you
GameBoy to make free long distance calls, crack answering machine passwords,
and just use it as a tone dialer. Well the new GameBoy Color has an
interesting feature, an IR port. As mentioned on HNN and elsewhere a few
months ago there are vehicles that use IR as a locking mechanism. With
currently available software you can now teach your GameBoy various IR codes
including those to unlock vehicles. Wondering how you get these programs
into your GameBoy? Well, Nintendo recently lost the court case against the
person making and selling GameBoy ROMS which makes it real easy to transfer
files around. Another example of how it is not the tool that is malicious
but the user.

*The Chinese military hopes to develop the capability of engaging in warfare<br>
over the Internet by training hackers to take the battle online.
The Liberation Army Daily (LAD), a mouthpiece of China's Peoples Liberation
Army (PLA), recently called for the development of this capability. The
paper said that, by recruiting civilian hackers and training "cyber
warriors" at Army schools, China could be prepared for an Internet war.
