<a name="1842qlink1">I went to a Mensa gathering as an undergraduate at UCLA.  You're right.  It 
was fun for a visit, but I wouldn't want to make it a religious routine to 
attend their meetings.  The other thing which has bothered me of recent 
vintage is that their criterion<a name="1841qlink1"> is the staid, old verbal/spatial reasoning 
aspect of IQ.</a>  Go into any Barnes and Noble and check out their tests for the 
masses.
<br>
They just don't 'get it'.
<br>
Mensans conveniently forget<a name="1841qlink2"> that IQ is now defined to measure other things in 
a person, viz. Creativity, Kinesthetics, Music Ability, etc.</a>  If Mensa was 
really concerned about some arbitrary cutoff of intellectual skills (the 
upper 2% if my 30 year old memory since college is correct), then they must 
include famous actors/actresses/musicians,athletes, etc. people whose IQ as 
defined by Mensans would be insinuatingly mediocre, but who have proven 
themselves as easily qualifying in the top 1 or 2%<a name="1841qlink3"> in their own 'intellectual 
abilities'.
