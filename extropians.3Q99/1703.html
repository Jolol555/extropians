I think what Eliezer means is that there was no experimental evidence
showing any problems with Newtonian gravitation.  However it is clear
that Newtonian gravity is incompatible with special relativity, since
it requires instantaneous action at a distance.  If you try to patch it
up with "lagged gravity" (where you are attracted to where the object
was at the speed-of-light time in the past) you get unstable orbits.
It was an attempt to come up with a theory of gravity that is consistent
with special relativity that led, after enormous difficulty, to general
relativity.  This then turned out to make some predictions that were
slightly different from Newtonian gravity, and to everyone's amazement
they were confirmed, turning Einstein into a superstar.
