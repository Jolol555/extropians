<a name="1055qlink1"><a name="1032qlink1">Why "unmistakable"?  Has it ever occured to you that relics of some 
extraterrestrial visit weren't meant to be "messages to mankind?"  You've 
backed into the same anthrocentric cul-de-sac as the extraterrestrial-UFO 
gurus who ask "Why haven't they landed on the White House law?" and think 
they've said something profound.</a>

Imagine this: a civilzation uses Mars as a temporary shelter of sorts a long, 
long time ago, when Mars still had abundant liquid water.  They go about 
their agenda, whatever it is) using complexes of self-contained ecologies and 
either leave or die off.  Their buildings are rained on, buried and reburied 
in sand, oxidized, wind-eroded...until, by mistake, they're found.</a>
