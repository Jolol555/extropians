<i>&gt; An Interview with </i><br>
<i>&gt; JOSEPH CHILTON PEARCE </i><br>
<i>&gt; by Chris Mercogliano and Kim Debus </i><br>
<i>&gt;from JOURNAL OF FAMILY LIFE magazine, Vol. 5 #1 1999 </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For nearly half a century Joseph Chilton Pearce, who prefers to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;known simplly as Joe, has been probing the mysteries of the human mind. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Author of The Crack in the Cosmic Egg, Exploring the Crack in the Cosmic </i><br>
<i>&gt;Egg, Magical Child, Magical Child Matures, Bond of Power and Evolution's </i><br>
<i>&gt;End, one of his overriding passions remains the study of what he calls </i><br>
<i>&gt;the "unfolding" of intelligence in children. He is a self-avowed </i><br>
<i>&gt;iconoclast, unafraid to speak out against the myriad ways in which </i><br>
<i>&gt;contemporary American culture fails to nurture the intellectual, </i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional and spiritual needs and yearnings of our young people. Part </i><br>
<i>&gt;scholar, part scientist, part mystic, part itinerant teacher, Joe keeps </i><br>
<i>&gt;in close touch with the most brilliant men and women in each field of </i><br>
<i>&gt;inure relevant to his guest. He creates a unique synthesis of their work </i><br>
<i>&gt;and translates the results into a common language-such a valuable </i><br>
<i>&gt;contribution in these days of increasing scientific specialization. Then </i><br>
<i>&gt;Joe travels the world wide to share his painstakingly gathered wisdom - </i><br>
<i>&gt;freely if necessary - with </i><br>
<i>&gt;anyone he feels can make a difference. We were fortunate enough to catch </i><br>
<i>&gt;him by phone at his home in central Virginia. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: Modern neuroscience has been making some startling discoveries </i><br>
<i>&gt;about the human heart. Can you tell us a bit about them in layman's </i><br>
<i>&gt;terms? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: The idea that we can think with our hearts is no longer just a </i><br>
<i>&gt;metaphor, but is, in fact, a very real phenomenon. We now know this </i><br>
<i>&gt;because the combined research of two or three fields is proving that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;heart is the major center of intelligence in human beings. Molecular </i><br>
<i>&gt;biologists have discovered that the heart is the body's most important </i><br>
<i>&gt;endocrine gland. In response to our experience of the world, it produces </i><br>
<i>&gt;and releases a major hormone, ANF - which stands for Atriol Neuriatic </i><br>
<i>&gt;Factor - that profoundly effects every operation in the limbic </i><br>
<i>&gt;structure, or what we refer to as the "emotional brain." This includes </i><br>
<i>&gt;the hippocampal area where memory and learning take place, and also the </i><br>
<i>&gt;control centers for the entire hormonal system. And neurocardiologist </i><br>
<a name="0562qlink1"><a name="0529qlink1"><a name="0515qlink1"><i>&gt;have found that 60 to 65% of the cells of the heart are actually neural </i><br>
<i>&gt;cells, not muscle cells as was previously believed. They are identical </i><br>
<i>&gt;to the neural cells in the brain, operating through the same connecting </i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;links called ganglia, with the same axonal and dendritic connections that </i><br>
<i>&gt;take place in the brain, as well as through the very same kinds of </i><br>
<i>&gt;neurotransmitters found in the brain. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;Quite literally, in other words, there is a "brain" in the heart, whose </i><br>
<i>&gt;ganglia are linked to every major organ in the body, to the entire </i><br>
<i>&gt;muscle spindle system that uniquely enables humans to express their </i><br>
<a name="0562qlink3"><i>&gt;emotions. About half of the heart's neural cells are involved in </i><br>
<i>&gt;translating information sent to it from all over the body so that it can </i><br>
<i>&gt;keep the body </i><br>
<i>&gt;working as one harmonious whole. And the other half make up a very </i><br>
<i>&gt;large, unmediated neural connection with the emotional brain in our head </i><br>
</a>
</a>
<i>&gt;and carry on a twenty-four-hour-a-day dialogue between the heart and the </i><br>
<i>&gt;brain that we are not even aware of. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kim: How does that work? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0573qlink1"><i>&gt; Joe: The heart responds to messages sent to it from the emotional </i><br>
<i>&gt;brain, which has been busy monitoring the interior environment of </i><br>
<i>&gt;dynamic states such as the emotions and the auto-immune system, guiding </i><br>
<i>&gt;behavior, and contributing to our sense of personal identity. The </i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;emotional brain makes a qualitative evaluation of our experience of this </i><br>
<i>&gt;world and sends that information instant-by-instant down to the heart. </i><br>
<i>&gt;In return, the heart exhorts the brain to make the appropriate response. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course all of this is on the non-verbal level. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;In other words, the responses that the heart makes effect the entire </i><br>
<i>&gt;human system. Meanwhile, biophysicists have discovered that the heart is </i><br>
<i>&gt;also a very powerful electromagnetic generator. It creates an </i><br>
<i>&gt;electromagnetic field that encompasses the body and extends out anywhere </i><br>
<i>&gt;from eight to twelve feet away from it. It is so powerful that you can </i><br>
<i>&gt;take an electrocardiogram reading from as far as three feet away from </i><br>
<i>&gt;the body. The field the heart produces is holographic, meaning that you </i><br>
<i>&gt;can read it from any point on the body and from any point within the </i><br>
<i>&gt;field. No matter how microscopic the sample is, you can receive the </i><br>
<i>&gt;information of the entire field. The intriguing thing is how profoundly </i><br>
<i>&gt;this electromagnetic field effects the brain. All indications are that </i><br>
<i>&gt;it furnishes the whole radio wave spectrum from which the brain draws </i><br>
<i>&gt;its material to create our internal experience of the world. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps most importantly, we now know that the radio spectrum of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;heart is profoundly affected by our emotional response to our world. Our </i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional response changes the heart's electromagnetic spectrum, which </i><br>
<i>&gt;is what the brain feeds on. Ultimately, everything in our lives hinges </i><br>
<i>&gt;on our emotional response to specific events. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: How does this emerging knowledge apply to children and their </i><br>
<i>&gt;healthy development? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: Children's emotional experience, how they feel about themselves </i><br>
<i>&gt;and the world around them, has a tremendous impact on their growth and </i><br>
<i>&gt;development. It's the foundation on which all learning, memory, health </i><br>
<i>&gt;and well-being are based. When that emotional structure is not stable </i><br>
<i>&gt;and positive for a child, no other developmental process within them </i><br>
<i>&gt;will function fully. Further development will only be compensatory to </i><br>
<i>&gt;any deficiencies. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;So, the first and foremost thing that must occur, if you want </i><br>
<i>&gt;intelligent, successful and healthy children, is that they must have a </i><br>
<i>&gt;positive emotional experience. There is forty or fifty years worth of </i><br>
<i>&gt;research from places like Harvard University, the University of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Arizona's medical school with people like Schwartz and Russick, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;HeartMath out in California to back this statement up. It all begins </i><br>
<i>&gt;with children feeling unconditionally wanted, accepted and loved. This </i><br>
<i>&gt;is the key to the entire operation. You can have everything else: a high </i><br>
<i>&gt;standard of living, the most expensive school system, the finest </i><br>
<i>&gt;teachers in the world; but if the children are lacking that initial </i><br>
<i>&gt;experience of being unconditionally loved by at least one person, and if </i><br>
<i>&gt;they do not feel safe and secure in their learning environment, then </i><br>
<i>&gt;nothing is going to happen very positively. This cannot be overstated. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: There would seem to be a lot of implications here for the way </i><br>
<i>&gt;we educate our children. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: The crux of the issue of education is that there are only two </i><br>
<i>&gt;types of learning; one is true learning and the other is conditioning. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Conditioning is a fear-filled response by the older, or what we call the </i><br>
<i>&gt;"hind," or "reptilian" brain. This is the reflexive, </i><br>
<i>&gt;survival, maintenance brain that responds as if threatened. A form of </i><br>
<i>&gt;learning does take place here, but it's conditioned learning and is </i><br>
<i>&gt;intimately associated with the emotional states of hostility, anger and </i><br>
<i>&gt;anxiety. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;If you want true learning, learning that involves the higher frontal </i><br>
<i>&gt;lobes - the intellectual,creative brain-then again, the emotional </i><br>
<i>&gt;environment must be positive and supportive. This is because at the </i><br>
<i>&gt;first sign of anxiety the brain shifts its functions from the high, </i><br>
<i>&gt;prefrontal lobes to the old defenses of the reptilian brain. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kim: It looks like you can make a case that our development is based, </i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps, more on nurture than on nature. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: The new research around this issue is quite intriguing. In </i><br>
<i>&gt;England, researchers have come up with the hypothesis that the </i><br>
<a name="0515qlink2"><i>&gt;environment profoundly changes the genetic structuring within us, that </i><br>
<i>&gt;it is the biggest influence of all on our DNA. There are studies now that </i><br>
<i>&gt;show that our genes are not at all locked into unchanging programs as </i><br>
<i>&gt;previously </i><br>
<i>&gt;thought, but in fact are profoundly affected by our environment, </i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;particularly our emotional environment. In the May issue of Science, </i><br>
<i>&gt;there was an article that discussed how the mother's emotional state </i><br>
<i>&gt;during pregnancy determined the direction that evolution would take </i><br>
<i>&gt;place within her developing fetus. Her state of well-being determines </i><br>
<i>&gt;whether fetal </i><br>
<i>&gt;brain development concentrates on the frontal loves or the ancient </i><br>
<i>&gt;reptilian brain involved in survival. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;This is probably the most explosive information to come along in quite a </i><br>
<i>&gt;while. And this makes perfect sense because the heart is the first organ </i><br>
<i>&gt;to form in the fetus, within ten days after conception, and it has to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;because it furnishes the electromagnetic spectrum upon which DNA itself </i><br>
<i>&gt;depends for its instructions. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kim: Are you saying that even after conception our genetic make-up </i><br>
<i>&gt;continues to change? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: Absolutely. And after birth as well, where you continue to see a </i><br>
<i>&gt;shift of emphasis between the reptilian brain and the emotional and </i><br>
<i>&gt;cognitive brains. Not only do you have these shifts occurring during the </i><br>
<i>&gt;first eleven years of life, you also have this huge redundancy of stuff </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the brain. Around the age of eleven or twelve the brain undergoes a </i><br>
<a name="0515qlink3"><i>&gt;fine tuning and begins to decide what it can get rid of. The brain </i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt;begins to shed the excess neural connections in either the ancient </i><br>
<i>&gt;survival brain or in the new intellectual brain. What is removed depends </i><br>
<i>&gt;upon children's life situations at that time. The question of whether </i><br>
<i>&gt;they feel safe and loved, or whether they feel like they must protect </i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves against a </i><br>
<i>&gt;hostile world has a profound effect on the intelligence of the child. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kim: Okay, so what about kids who were raised in negative households </i><br>
<i>&gt;and who haven't had that unconditional love? What can we do to reverse </i><br>
<i>&gt;this process and empower them to grow up to be whole persons? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: well, to me, the whole thing again boils down to the heart. The </i><br>
<i>&gt;kids you're speaking of have been deprived of adequate heart-brain </i><br>
<i>&gt;nurturing. They have been operating in an environment of deep </i><br>
<i>&gt;deprivation and the only thing you can do is to somehow or other provide </i><br>
<i>&gt;them with a nurturing environment where they feel safe and loved and </i><br>
<i>&gt;wanted. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;I know it sounds too simplistic, but really that's the whole story. </i><br>
<i>&gt;These young people need audio-vocal communication, nurturing, play, body </i><br>
<i>&gt;movement, eye contact, sweet sounds and close heart contact on a </i><br>
<i>&gt;physical level. Look at Marianna Caplin's new book that just came out </i><br>
<i>&gt;called Untouched. It's a brilliant, incredibly well-documented work that </i><br>
<i>&gt;ranks </i><br>
<i>&gt;right up there with Ashley Montique's classic book on touch written </i><br>
<i>&gt;thirty years ago. It deals with the touch-starved American child who has </i><br>
<i>&gt;never received enough emotional or physical nurturing. We must </i><br>
<i>&gt;understand here that the emotional and physical are essentially the </i><br>
<i>&gt;same. So many American teenagers today have been deprived of touch and </i><br>
<i>&gt;love from the very beginning of their lives. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: What happens to them as a result? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: They try to make up for that lack with all kinds of culturally </i><br>
<i>&gt;provided substitutes that don't satisfy their needs. For the past </i><br>
<i>&gt;fifteen years Ann Morrison in New York State has been working with </i><br>
<i>&gt;hard-core teenage criminals in maximum security prisons, young people </i><br>
<i>&gt;between the ages of fifteen and twenty who are considered by society to </i><br>
<i>&gt;be unredeemable. She laments at how the public doesn't understand how </i><br>
<i>&gt;easily salvageable they are. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Through storytelling, play acting and a whole series of activities like </i><br>
<i>&gt;that, Ann just wins over these largely uneducated and illiterate teens. </i><br>
<i>&gt;All of a sudden they're reading, they're writing their on poetry and </i><br>
<i>&gt;they're expressing themselves in a variety of ways. She started out by </i><br>
<i>&gt;following her on heart's instincts. With great love, she sent in and </i><br>
<i>&gt;began quietly telling her stories, even though they had the TVs going </i><br>
<i>&gt;and they are doing all of the usual child, noisy, rambunctious things </i><br>
<i>&gt;that teenagers do. And she as able to reach them because she was offering </i><br>
<i>&gt;something that they had never had - a mother figure, a compassionate </i><br>
<i>&gt;woman friend. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;As Margaret Mead said, "Art is the language that is the language of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;heart, that is the language of the emotional structure." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: Didn't you once say that imaginative children are never </i><br>
<i>&gt;violent? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: Well, in Sweden there is a group of doctors who claim this to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;true. Their studies show that children who have an abundant capacity for </i><br>
<i>&gt;creating inner-world images are never violent. Plus whenever they're </i><br>
<i>&gt;faced with violence, they are able to imagine and implement alternative </i><br>
<i>&gt;solutions. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; That's what Ann Morrison is giving those young people, the opportunity </i><br>
<i>&gt;to re-fashion their internal worlds, to establish the heart/emotional </i><br>
<i>&gt;brain connection that was never allowed to develop during their </i><br>
<i>&gt;childhood's. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: I think I've also heard you say that television is the </i><br>
<i>&gt;arch-enemy of imagination. Exactly what is television doing to our </i><br>
<i>&gt;children? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: Television literally prevents neural growth in the developing </i><br>
<i>&gt;brains of children. When young children watch too much, it suppresses </i><br>
<i>&gt;the capacity of their brains to create an internal image of some thing, </i><br>
<i>&gt;or some one, or some event not presented to the sensory system by the </i><br>
<i>&gt;environment, which is the essence of what we call "imagination." </i><br>
<i>&gt;Researchers used to think that it was only the content of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;programming that was negatively affecting children. Now we have ample </i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence that the technology of the device is very harmful in and of </i><br>
<i>&gt;itself. In other words, the simple act of watching television has </i><br>
<i>&gt;profoundly negative </i><br>
<i>&gt;effects on the physiology of human beings. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: How so? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: It's a long story, dating all the way back to the early 1960's </i><br>
<i>&gt;when it was discovered that kids' minds go catatonic in front of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;"tube." This has to do with the way that the brain reacts to radiant </i><br>
<i>&gt;light, which is the light source of television and computer monitors, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and reflected light, which is what brings us the rest of our visual </i><br>
<i>&gt;experience. This is too complicated to go all the way into here, so let </i><br>
<i>&gt;me just say that the brain tends to close down in response to radiant </i><br>
<i>&gt;light sources. We've all seen how hypnotized children get when they </i><br>
<i>&gt;watch television for any length of time. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;My biggest concern has to do with the way the television industry </i><br>
<i>&gt;countered this effect by introducing what are known as "startle effects" </i><br>
<i>&gt;into children's programming. A startle effect is anything that triggers </i><br>
<i>&gt;the brain into thinking that there might be an emergency out there and </i><br>
<i>&gt;alerts it to pay special attention to the source of the disturbance. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Television accomplishes this with sudden and dramatic changes of </i><br>
<i>&gt;intensity of light or sound and a rapid shifting of camera angles. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Eventually, however, the brain starts habituating itself to the </i><br>
<i>&gt;situation, realizing that these are just false alarms, and it starts to </i><br>
<i>&gt;tune out again. As a result, every ten years or so the television </i><br>
<i>&gt;industry has had to up the </i><br>
<i>&gt;ante by making the startles bigger and bigger, until finally what we </i><br>
<i>&gt;have are periodic bursts of violent imagery in children's cartoons and </i><br>
<i>&gt;so on, to the point now where there are an average of sixteen bits of </i><br>
<i>&gt;violence every half-hour. Here the nature of the program content does </i><br>
<i>&gt;matter. While the higher brain, or neocortex, knows that the images on </i><br>
<i>&gt;TV aren't </i><br>
<i>&gt;real, the lower, or the "reptilian" brain does not. This means that when </i><br>
<i>&gt;a child views violence on television, the reptilian brain sends a series </i><br>
<i>&gt;of alarm messages up to the emotional brain, which in turn immediately </i><br>
<i>&gt;contacts the heart. The moment the heart receives any indication of </i><br>
<i>&gt;negativity or danger, it drops out of its usual harmonic mode into an </i><br>
<i>&gt;incoherent one, triggering the release of the single most potent hormone </i><br>
<i>&gt;in the human body, known as cortisol. Cortisol instantly wakes up the </i><br>
<i>&gt;brain and causes it to produce trillions of neural links in order to </i><br>
<i>&gt;ready the individual to face the emergency. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Then, as soon as the heart gets the message that the coast is clear, </i><br>
<i>&gt;another hormone is released to dissolve all of the new neural pathways </i><br>
<i>&gt;that weren't used to make a quick, adaptive reaction to the perceived </i><br>
<i>&gt;threat. The trouble with current-day children's television programming </i><br>
<i>&gt;is that there's never any letdown, and the brain of the average American </i><br>
<i>&gt;child, who has watched 5000 to 6000 hours by the age of five of six, is </i><br>
<i>&gt;suffering a great deal of confusion as a result. The massive </i><br>
<i>&gt;over-stimulus from TV is causing the brain to maladapt in ways </i><br>
<i>&gt;previously thought impossible. It is literally breaking down on all </i><br>
<i>&gt;levels of neural development. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kim: can you give us any specific examples? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: I'll give you a couple. The German Psychological Institute has </i><br>
<i>&gt;conducted a twenty-year study of 4000 children per year, children who </i><br>
<i>&gt;have watched the average 5000 to 6000 hours of television by the age of </i><br>
<i>&gt;six. Researchers found that twenty years ago young people could </i><br>
<i>&gt;distinguish between 360 different shadings of a single color category </i><br>
<i>&gt;like red or blue. Today it's down to about 130. That's over a 2/3 loss </i><br>
<i>&gt;of their ability to detect shadings of color. Now, this is strictly a </i><br>
<i>&gt;neuro-cognitive breakdown. The most serious change they uncovered was a </i><br>
<i>&gt;breakdown of the brain's ability to cross index its whole </i><br>
<i>&gt;kinesthetic/sensory system. That is, more and more children's sensory </i><br>
<i>&gt;systems are acting as isolated components in the brain and less and less </i><br>
<i>&gt;as coordinated whole gestalts. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;When they placed the young test subject in a natural environment that </i><br>
<i>&gt;had no high-density stimuli, such as come from television, they grew </i><br>
<i>&gt;very anxiety-ridden, bored and tended toward violence. The final </i><br>
<i>&gt;disturbing finding of the German study is that there has been over the </i><br>
<i>&gt;same twenty-year period, a 20% reduction in the children's awareness of </i><br>
<i>&gt;their </i><br>
<i>&gt;natural environment. This fits right in with Marcia Mikulac's studies in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the 80s on evolution, where she discovered a 20 to 285% reduction in </i><br>
<i>&gt;American children's ability to bring in environmental sensory signal as </i><br>
<i>&gt;opposed to that of children from pre-literate, non-technological </i><br>
<i>&gt;societies. So, the German studies back up what we've already known about </i><br>
<i>&gt;the desensitization of children who are exposed to the inappropriate </i><br>
<i>&gt;stimuli from sources such as television, rock music and computers. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: Jerry Mander pointed out in his book on television that when </i><br>
<i>&gt;television was first introduced it was advertised as this wonderful, </i><br>
<i>&gt;democratic technology that would make everybody's life better and serve </i><br>
<i>&gt;as an educational tool available free of charge to all. And the American </i><br>
<i>&gt;culture of the fifties bought this fantasy lock, stock and barrel. So </i><br>
<i>&gt;how about computers in the 90s? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: Well, computers fall into essentially the same category. Here's </i><br>
<i>&gt;one example that demonstrates how they can have the same debilitating </i><br>
<i>&gt;effects on the mind that television has. Researchers took a single page </i><br>
<i>&gt;from a fourth grade level textbook that had explanatory writing and a </i><br>
<i>&gt;couple of diagrams or pictures on it and asked three groups of people to </i><br>
<i>&gt;review the information. Group A was given the piece of paper itself to </i><br>
<i>&gt;study. Group B was shown a movie of the page, and group C viewed it on a </i><br>
<i>&gt;television screen - which is exactly the same as a computer monitor. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Twenty minutes later they tested them on their comprehension and </i><br>
<i>&gt;retention of the material. Group A, who held a paper copy in their </i><br>
<i>&gt;hands, averaged a retention level of 85%. Those who saw it on the movie </i><br>
<i>&gt;screen had a </i><br>
<i>&gt;retention level of between 25 to 30%, and those who studied it on the TV </i><br>
<i>&gt;monitor had a retention and comprehension level between 3 and 5%. When </i><br>
<i>&gt;they mixed the groups up and tested them again with different pages from </i><br>
<i>&gt;the book, in every case the retention and comprehension was identical. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;This again has to do with how the brain is constructed and the way it </i><br>
<i>&gt;responds to radiant light rather than reflected light as a source of </i><br>
<i>&gt;information. And it should make us pause to consider, but it won't. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: Why? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: I attended a computer conference at the University of California </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;at Berkeley during which twenty-one of us from all over the world spent </i><br>
<i>&gt;four days discussing the computers-in-education issue. At that very time </i><br>
<i>&gt;the State of California had a 500-million-dollar bill pending for a </i><br>
<i>&gt;pilot project of K-12 computerized education. They asked me to come and </i><br>
<i>&gt;speak to any legislators who would listen and give them a report on what </i><br>
<i>&gt;we had discovered during those four days at Berkeley. The woman </i><br>
<i>&gt;engineering this, </i><br>
<i>&gt;who at the time was head of the Republican strategy department, was </i><br>
<i>&gt;fired for asking me to come and speak. It just goes to show you how much </i><br>
<i>&gt;money and power is involved. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kim: But, so many occupations these days involve computers. How do we </i><br>
<i>&gt;teach young people what they need to know about computers without </i><br>
<i>&gt;relying on them too much? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: At that four-day symposium at Berkeley we concluded that </i><br>
<i>&gt;everything hinges on age appropriateness. One professor from MIT made </i><br>
<i>&gt;the passionate plea that we must encourage children to develop the </i><br>
<i>&gt;ability to think first, and then give them the computer. After that the </i><br>
<i>&gt;sky's the limit. But if you introduce the computer before the child's </i><br>
<i>&gt;thought processes </i><br>
<i>&gt;are worked out, then you have disaster in the making. This is because, </i><br>
<i>&gt;as Piaget pointed out, the first twelve years of life are spent putting </i><br>
<i>&gt;into place the structures of knowledge that enable young people to grasp </i><br>
<i>&gt;abstract, metaphoric, symbolic types of information. The capacity for </i><br>
<i>&gt;abstract thinking developed as a result of the natural concrete </i><br>
<i>&gt;processes that have been going on for millions of years. The danger here </i><br>
<i>&gt;is that the computer, which operates by the same artificial, </i><br>
<i>&gt;cathode-ray-tube technology as the television, will interrupt that </i><br>
<i>&gt;development. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: TV and computers aside, I get the sense from a lot of young </i><br>
<i>&gt;people I know that they feel something is missing from their lives. Have </i><br>
<i>&gt;you noticed this in your travels? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: I've often talked about three important characteristics of all </i><br>
<i>&gt;teenagers. The first is a feeling they have of great expectation that </i><br>
<i>&gt;something tremendous is supposed to happen in their lives around the age </i><br>
<i>&gt;of fifteen or sixteen. The second is the feeling that some greatness </i><br>
<i>&gt;exists within them. The third is a longing that is so intense it can </i><br>
<i>&gt;never be assuaged. And so at this point teenagers begin looking for </i><br>
<i>&gt;models of who they can be, someone to help them define and put that deep </i><br>
<i>&gt;longing into perspective. And what do they get? They get MTV, they get </i><br>
<i>&gt;rock stars, they get all of the rest of the trash in movies and on </i><br>
<i>&gt;television. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kim: This is the stage of life when many other cultures encourage </i><br>
<i>&gt;spiritual growth through things like coming-of-age and rights-of-passage </i><br>
<i>&gt;rituals. Do you think the absence of these in our culture is one of our </i><br>
<i>&gt;downfalls? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: Certainly, but the things you're speaking of are vehemently </i><br>
<i>&gt;blocked by our society because they're not economically viable. They </i><br>
<i>&gt;can't be given a dollar value. Young people looking for something of </i><br>
<i>&gt;meaning and substance out there have a terrible time finding what </i><br>
<i>&gt;they're seeking because they are locked into our cultural system. Look </i><br>
<i>&gt;into Ralph Nader </i><br>
<i>&gt;and Linda Coco's new book on the corporate exploitation of children. </i><br>
<i>&gt;It's a bomb shell. For instance, when Ralph Nader approached Bob </i><br>
<i>&gt;Pittman, who invented MTV, and asked him if he realized the profound </i><br>
<i>&gt;influence they were having on fourteen year olds, the guy leanedback and </i><br>
<i>&gt;said, "Ralph, we don't influence fourteen-year-olds, we own them." </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Today there are actually entrepreneurs in the marketplace selling </i><br>
<i>&gt;programs to corporations detailing how to exploit the child mind! In </i><br>
<i>&gt;other words, we are totally set up right now as a consumer society, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;changing that fact would literally threaten our economy. I don't think </i><br>
<i>&gt;you can change this reality on any large-scale basis. You can only try </i><br>
<i>&gt;to work around </i><br>
<i>&gt;the edges and hope to reach one individual at a time. No one's going to </i><br>
<i>&gt;change the overall system. All we can do is appeal to parents who have </i><br>
<i>&gt;ears to hear and who are willing to take the risk of getting their </i><br>
<i>&gt;children out of this madness and protect them against it. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Chris: What advice would you give to individual parents of teenagers </i><br>
<i>&gt;about how they can help them to pursue their deepest desires? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: Well, first of all a great many teenagers have no idea what their </i><br>
<i>&gt;desires are because they haven't been given the opportunity to find out. </i><br>
<i>&gt;So, we can start by helping them to identify their desires. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;Next, we can start being more proactive rather than reactionary. Most of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the crises that are occurring in our young people today are arbitrary, </i><br>
<i>&gt;that is they're created by the culture itself. Instead of spending </i><br>
<i>&gt;millions of dollars trying to fix what's wrong with teens we should </i><br>
<i>&gt;invest in educating people to be good parents, to love and nurture their </i><br>
<i>&gt;babies and young children so they don't have huge problems later on. The </i><br>
<i>&gt;first four years of life are the most important. In Sweden, new mothers </i><br>
<i>&gt;are given three years of maternity leave. It used to be one, and now </i><br>
<i>&gt;they've upped it to three so that mothers can stay home with their </i><br>
<i>&gt;children. And they're giving fathers a one-year leave of absence with </i><br>
<i>&gt;full pay so that both mother and father can be with their child for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;first critical year. So when you ask what can we do with our teenagers, </i><br>
<i>&gt;I say we can begin by preventing the damage right from the very </i><br>
<i>&gt;beginning. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Kim: So you think there's hope for us? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Joe: There are some extraordinary things happening right now, in </i><br>
<i>&gt;little pockets all over the world, examples of true coherency in a </i><br>
<i>&gt;massively incoherent system. And when this global economy nightmare </i><br>
<i>&gt;we've unleashed finally self-destructs - as I think it has to -these </i><br>
<i>&gt;small pockets of coherent intelligence will then manifest themselves and </i><br>
<i>&gt;provide the impetus and the wisdom for the changes necessary to create a </i><br>
<i>&gt;world in which children can reach their full potential. I am very </i><br>
<i>&gt;optimistic about this. </i><br>
