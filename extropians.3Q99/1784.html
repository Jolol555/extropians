<a href="1766.html#1784qlink1">    &gt;Actually, the whole "paradox" of free will is an illusion.</a><br>

<p>
It's no illusion, and there is no paradox. In 1930 Godel rigorously proved that
sometimes a machine can never know if eventually it will be in a certain state
or not, a few yeas later Turing rigorously proved that a machine can not always
distinguish between the times that it can make this discrimination and the times
that it can not. In other words, the machine knows with as great a certainty as it
know anything that sometimes it will surprise itself, and just as important, it will
surprise itself at the timing of this uncertainty. To put this in yet another way,
a machine knows it has free will. I can find absolutely no reason to think that
humane are not machines and can find absolutely no reason humans should
not be proud of that fact.
