I've sent the following to the exi-tex list and some individual email 
addresses.  If you're a Third-Coaster who's not subscribed to the exi-tex  
list -- which you should be, and can easily do at the extropy.org website -- 
you're invited:

<p>
It's time for an after-EXTRO4, end-of-the-summer swimming and eating 
get-together.  You're all welcome at my place on Saturday, August 21.  We'll 
look at some of the video and the stills I shot at EXTRO4, talk about the 
conference and plans for future (and also just generally hang out, play with 
the lemurs and solve the world's problems).

<p>
I'd like to get an accurate head-count by no later than early next week, so 
please let me know as soon as possible if you'll be attending.  I'm imagining 
we'll get started mid-afternoon or so.  Also, as many of you know, I have a 
<a name="2034qlink1">few un-extropic habits, so my default presumption is that we'll cook out.  If 
an old-fashioned Texas carnivorous diet isn't on your bill of fare, please 
let me know.</a>  I'll post up directions to the house as plans become more firm.
