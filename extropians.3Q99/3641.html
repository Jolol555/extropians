Perhaps not too much different -- "you must believe this otherwise
you will be damned..." (in the extreme cases).  Or -- "the universe
cannot be understood, this provides the only explanation..." (in the
milder case).

<p>
The immunity towards all ideas varies from individual to individual.
You *must* base the explanation in a person's own personal experience
and then work your way out to group experiences.

<p>
Base the discussions strongly on their experience as *verified*
by others experience.  Force them to confront (a) the fact that
universal experiences are "valid", while non-universal experiences
are just that (non-universal); and (b) that they were probably
given their beliefs before they were able to think critically
and could determine whether they were being fed "facts"
(i.e. gravity) or "beliefs".

<p>
Then explain how science works, i.e. peer review, acceptance
until a theory which better explains the facts appears, etc.
Science is an open system, anyone with sufficient motivation
can verify it.  It is/was not dictated by a specific individual.

<p>
<a name="3651qlink1">Force them back until they are confronted with the paradox of their
position (they can't prove (get universal acceptance) of their beliefs),
then offer them an alternative.
