That statement implies that people not subject to or required to register for
Selective Service (that is, females) have nothing worth living</a> for. As a man you
might find this an acceptable conclusion, but females will probably raise the
occasional objection. &lt;sneer&gt; As I pointed out earlier, the cruel and violent
practice of mutilating the male genitalia indicates a deep-seated (although
perhaps subliminal) societal aversion to men and masculinity, and especially a
fear and hatred of male sexuality. Of course, in a heterosexually normed
culture, officially sanctioned violence toward one sex more than toward the
other, meets with very little opposition. Nevertheless, careful observers can
detect the anti-male sexism inherent in female-oriented society at large (with
the exception of a very few -- and tainted -- pro-male enclaves).
