I think that you could do that quite easily, without necessarily altering
your biological structure!  My own gender identity is androgynous, and my
female biology has rarely gotten in the way of expressing the more
'masculine' or 'feminine' parts of my personality.  I don't feel 'male' or
'female', I feel 'human'.  

<p>
Robert has an important point in saying that men and women should be 'in
touch' with their respective aspects, because that provides the key for
moving beyond what you were born with.  

<p>
I would add, however, that one does not necessarily have to be content with
that, or to remain in that particular aspect.  Why should we?  Our bodies,
our minds, and our personalities are increasingly distributed, pliable, and
changeable.  Why do I see so much fear over expressing that in these
various threads?  Aren't we the one group of people who would leap happily
into these new modes of expression?  Why are we trying to cling to
established modes of male, female, hetero, homo?
