<a name="1276qlink2">I have no idea either, but I would suspect it's because of the whole "race" 
mentality that's been associated with space here on Earth (i.e. Apollo).  I 
don't think the posts that cling so voraciously to nanotech (to the point of 
redefining what an interstellar voyage is for no sensible reason whatsoever) 
have much to do with aliens; instead, they're projections of what might 
happen to _us_.</a>  As such, they're very welcome.  As applied to aliens--real 
_aliens_, as opposed to hypothetical creatures with peculiarly human 
motivations and human lifestyles--I don't find them particularly logical.
