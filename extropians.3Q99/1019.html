<a href="0985.html#1019qlink1">&gt;Maybe rather than going on about how open-minded you are because you</a><br>
<i>&gt;are willing to accept that the Face may be artificial, you can simply</i><br>
<i>&gt;say how likely you think it is to be artificial.  Other list members</i><br>
<i>&gt;may then wish to chime in with their own quantitative estimates, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;you can have a more meaningful discussion.</i><br>

<p>
This was never about being "open-minded," but I'll address your challenge.

<p>
Simply, _we need more data_.  Some of the formations are quite compelling.  
But I must ground this in the stark fact that Mars is a different planet 
(Earthlike, yes, but possessed of a different geology).  Let's take one 
feature: the Crater Pyramid (one of the least known anomalies, probably 
because it lacks the "romance" of the Face).  I'm 100% certain it was formed 
after the adjacent meteor impact (that physical law and common sense say 
should have flattened it utterly).  So how did it get there?  

<p>
I know if I propose artificiality, I'll be bombarded with posts lambasting 
the prospect of interstellar travel, so I really don't know what to say.  I 
suppose that for this particular feature I'd be willing to go 50/50 between 
geology and artificiality.  If I'm proved wrong--great!  I will have learned 
something (along with a great many  Martian gelogists).
