&gt; Read any good books lately?<br>

<p>
The Fabric of Reality: The Science of Parallel Universes
David Deutsch
<br>
1997 Penguin books

<p>
It says on the cover: "A leading scientist interweaves evolution,
theoretical physics, and computer science to offer a new understanding
of reality." Most books published these days say that on the cover.

<p>
It delivers. One of the most extropian books in existence, it seems
to me.

<p>
some topics:
<br>
Limits of classical computation.
<br>
The many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics.
Time travel as shifting to a slightly alternate universe.
Quantum computation to get beyond the limits of classical
computation:

<p>
<a name="2189qlink1">    "To those who still cling to a single-universe world-view, I
    issue this challenge: explain how Shor's Algorithm works. ....
    When Shor's Algorithm has factorized a number, using 10^500 or
    so times the computational resources that can be seen to be
    present, where was the number factorized? There are only about
    10^80 atoms in the entire visible universe, an utterly
    miniscule number compared with 10^500. So if the visible
    universe were the extent of physical reality, physical reality
    would not even remotely contain the resources required to
    factorize such a large number. ..." p</a> 217

<p>
[ I note in passing that the aforementioned Shor just got
a MacArthur grant, mostly for coming up with Shor's Algorithm...]

<p>
This got me interested in quantum computation. There are numerous
websites on it; I just got this book, I don't know if it's great yet.:

<p>
Explorations in Quantum Computing
<br>
Colin P. Williams, Scott H. Clearwater
<br>
1998, Springer. with cdrom.
