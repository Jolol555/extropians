<a name="2868qlink1"><a href="2855.html#2859qlink1">&gt; This is only true if you're talking about capitalism in a very abstract</a><br>
<i>&gt; sense.  Keep in mind that capitalism as we know it could not</a> exist without</i><br>
<a name="2868qlink2"><i>&gt; inventions like intellectual property, contract law,</a> the limited liability</i><br>
<a name="2868qlink3"><i>&gt; corporation, etc. I don't see any of these things as more self-evident</i><br>
<i>&gt; than some socialistic notions - for instance the right of workers to form</i><br>
<i>&gt; unions and bargain collectively.</i><br>

<p>
Bizarre list.  "Contract law" probably belongs there, but I'm inclined
to see that as nothing more than a natural mechanism of making and
maintaining commitments.  Intellectual property and limited liability
corporations have nothing at all to do with capitalism--many (including
me) consider them both perversions of that ideal, and would love to
dispense with them both.  Finally, collective bargaining is not a
socialist concept at all, but a fine capitalist one, also being nothing
but a natural consequence of the right to make and enforce commitments.
Sounds like your idea of what capitalism is has been instilled in your
brain by a socialist education system</a> :)
