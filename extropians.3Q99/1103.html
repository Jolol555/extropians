&gt; NO CAKE FOR YOU<br>

and 

<p>
&gt; THE PRYING GAME<br>
&gt; Author: Matt Walker<br>

Civil Disobedience with the pleasure of eating a 
poppy seed cake is likely method combat invasive 
drug testing. 

<p>
Parties at the office just before the most likely 
times would embarrass the drug testing companies 
that profit from their incompetent because they 
are known to be inprecise testing procedures.

  <li> 	Bake up or better yet have a contest for 
the best tasting 'Poppy Seed' cakes or cupcakes 
for the office personal. 

  <li> 	Make sure you plan this just ahead of 
the testing of employees of your company or 
organization so that most of the people test 
positive, therefore the test is now void. 

  <li> 	Produce party or gatherings tasty 
vittles of any and all foods that lead to false 
positives frequently and often. 

  <li> 	If you are a daring individual, make sure
the organization top level consumes these bake 
goods. 

  <li> 	Litigators be ready to sue the drug testing 
companies for entries into medical records and any 
employer acting on a false positive with malice of 
forethought.  Basically after the party a little 
citation or showing of the 'New Scientist' ought 
to give more than the H. R. director pause of entering 
much ninto your file or anyone elses for that matter. 

  <li> 	Short the stocks potentially of any lab 
doing drug testings because now you know there  
are groups out there getting ready to sue the snot 
of them as well.  But of course this is a high risk 
maneuver and not investment advice on my part along 
with a conjecture that entries like this false positive 
liability scenerio may or may not translate into a 
real market gain for anyone outside of the legal 
community ready to take this issue on. 

  <li> 	Find even more foods that lead to false 
positives or even OTC medicines and make sure these 
items are in abundance to keep the stream of false 
positives at an ever increasing volume. 

  <li> 	Get a copy of New Scientist issue with these 
articles in it to increase awareness.

Enough said, the meme has been publicly cast out 
and will now take an existence of its own. ;) 

<p>
P. S. Sure maybe someone like does zero consumption 
of targeted stuff done in testing but I do know for 
a fact that one large insurance company drug tests 
all of their employees except at the very top executive 
washroom level and that atleast one of those executives 
is an active drug consumer, this is demographically 
conceivable for many large companies in the Fortune 1000.
