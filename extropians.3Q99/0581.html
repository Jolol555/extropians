That's my best estimate.

<p>
The first radio transmission was March 27, 1899.
My best guess-estimate for the singularity would be circa 2020.
I would be very surprised if we hit it before 2010 or after 2040.

<p>
So within a factor of 2 I'm accurate (and since for the numbers
I usually deal with are in the ranges of 10^12 - 10^40, 2 seems
really small :-)).

<a name="0616qlink2">You can quibble with me on this but I think I'm on pretty solid
ground.  Best predictions for the microelectronics industry hitting
the gate oxide thickness limit of 5 atoms is 2012.  The semiconductor
industry is $200 billion+, R&amp;D is probably $20 billion+.  The human
genome is done by 2001, mouse by 2002, by ~2010 the combined R&amp;D
budgets of the NIH and Big Pharma will be around $30 billion+.
The Microelectronics &amp; Biotech industries are working top-down
towards nanotechnologies.

<p>
The U.S. Government is bumping "nanotechnology" funding to
$500 million next year.  And while most of it is not in
"molecular nanotechnology" the trend is in that direction.

<p>
So it is fairly safe to say that after 2010, the annual budget
for nanotechnology research should be in the $billions.
That should get us over the nanoassembler hurdle.

<a name="0616qlink3">The microelectronics industry also produces brain-op desktop
computers by around 2010.  I don't want to get into an AI
discussion here, but if you get AI *or* significant
enhancement of human engineering productivity, then
I believe the molecular design (and simulation) problems
should fall.

<p>
molecular designs + nanoassembler == singularity in my book.

<p>
Other civilizations may be slower, some might be faster.
My guess is that the rate of development depends a lot
on population and the productivity allowed by the environment
(e.g. we would probably be less productive in an ice age,
because survival would require more effort).
