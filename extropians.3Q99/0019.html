I've got a much better system for getting to sleep. It doesn't involve any
drugs, and you'll have forearms like Popeye (well one of them anyway...)
without having to eat any of that spinach shit.
Have a wank. Every night, regular as clockwork. Sends you right off,
especially if you have a couple of joints and/or a glass of beer first.

Rob.

P.S. Subscribe to some porn channels, too. Before you know it, bedtime will
be the coolest part of the day......
<br>
Of course, unless you're single you'll have to become very interested in the
TV programme currently on telly when your missus goes to bed, so you can get
some joyous minutes of lone action.
