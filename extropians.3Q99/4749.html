    I think this means that it will not be possible to generalise about
     nano cities; some might be built underground, other soar into the
    skies. The material constraints are still there, but so relaxed
    compared to current ones that the cities can indeed look like
    anything.

<p>
Oh yes, of course!!! This is why my paintings are not getting off the ground. 
The idea of archi-nan has tooooooooooo many possibilities. I can't seem to 
pick a theme and get painting, I do endless sketches of structures that look 
like anything from seed pods, to anemones to growing plants to women's 
behinds.. and I like them all! So I was actually hoping someone had seen some 
images. Closest to my heart so far is Roger Dean, for he uses colors that are 
not the usual "cold black gray metal with stars" so prevalent in SF and he 
uses organic shapes.<a name="5074qlink1"> The only thing I am SURE of is that the shapes will have 
a heck of a lot more curves than they do now.</a>

 
<p>
<a href="4725.html#4749qlink1">&gt;&gt;  However, all the wonderful ideas posted here assume a modernistic</a><br>
<p>
    planned city, with somebody who says "Hey! Let's build Transburg
    underground!" or "What if we made New Muse City *mobile*? &gt;&gt;

<p>
Well, I don't want my own Nan-city, just my hard-to-pin-down series of 
paintings about future cities.( musing on it.... If I did have a city it 
would be a musical theme I suppose...) Maybe a few series about them, and 
mobility is certainly one challenging ergonomic to portray.


<p>
    &gt;A more realistic situation would be the
    gradual retrofitting of current cities and the emergence of new
    cities, likely with even less central planning than today (given that
    the assumed level of nanotech is so strong there is no need for much
    centralization; in a feed scenario a la the Diamond Age other forms of
    cities make sense).

<p>
Yes, and No.
<br>
Conversion, from my understanding of it, would make it unnecessary to 
piecemeal a city. One could '"retrofit," replacing nan with existing 
materials (like people talk about redoing their dead bodies after cryo) with 
assemblers, correct? Of course historians would want to preserve beautiful 
places like New Orleans and Paris' left bank, etc.. and so we wouldn't lose 
our old world places.(you could even reassemble a perfect nan version of it 
so it would go on forever instead of rotting). Buildings would be "seeded", 
instead of  framed, poured, hung or plastered... and  we are always looking 
for  a good antidote to the hated "Urban Sprawl".<a name="5074qlink2"> A planner would plan the 
"growth" of the buildings,<a name="5105qlink1"> why not whole cities. They could even be planned 
to grown over a certain time frame, as population increased.</a></a> 

<p>
And it would of course depend on legislation of nanotech, communities will 
either vote it *in* or *not*, out or fear or whatever. So cities who have 
nanotech will by and large be taking on quite a radical conversion, not 
piecemeal scattered factories and skyscrapers.

<p>
<a name="5074qlink3">I remember that island...
<br>
Please send me a detailed private e-mail description of your waterfall city 
Anders and I'll be happy to do some sketches of it .....and perhaps who 
knows, even a seed may plant in my mind for a whole painting!! The jungle 
awaits....
