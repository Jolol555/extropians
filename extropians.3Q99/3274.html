<a name="3276qlink1">I don't agree with this. We understand, in principle, how quantum
processes could be harnessed to do computational work. Actually building
one is an engineering problem. (Not to minimize the size of that problem -
the difficulty of the engineering problem is why Leonardo DaVinci didn't
go into business selling helicopters.)</a>

In contrast, we don't know how to make AI happen. Radically increased
computer speed is a necessary but insufficient condition. (Unless you want
to posit computers fast enough to evolve simulated intelligences or model
the brain a cell at a time.) The brain is not just a big general purpose
processor, there's a lot of software and specialized hardware that we
don't understand.<a name="3276qlink2"> Where does your 2020 figure come from? (I'm afraid I
don't know how to expand the 'CRNS' qualifier.)
