	Actually, I don't write poetry anymore...but I will post one which, I
believe, sums up my thoughts on art.



<p>
Creation


<p>
Love ruminates and illuminates
<br>
And dances upon the artist's soul,
<br>
With a cloven foot and a callused palm
<br>
And a will to make the meaning whole.

<p>
Life's creations reveal sensations
<br>
And notions of what beauty should be,
<br>
And what it is now and has always been
<br>
And helps unveil the mystery.

<p>
The artist creates, his passion pulsates,
And the world is awed by his intent --unclear,
While their thoughts try to hide from their mind's eyes,
What they want to see, they try to fear.

<p>
For all that is true, and all that is new
Is never enough to convince those who Know,
And the truth is forbidden --merely locked inside,
And the process of art is painful and slow.

<p>
But the artist persists and his spirit resists
The ties to all judgment and extrapolation,
He ignores all the bounds and demands on his work
And devotes himself wholly to his creation.
