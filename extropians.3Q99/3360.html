You can find that information for STHF/Aleph at
<a href="http://www.aleph.se/Aleph/historia.html">http://www.aleph.se/Aleph/historia.html</a> and
<a href="http://www.aleph.se/aleph.html">http://www.aleph.se/aleph.html</a> although it is in Swedish.

<p>
In our case, the association began as a mailing list run by Felix
Ungman, where we discussed transhumanism-related stuff. People joined
in because they heard about it from friends, through the swedish young
scientist association or found it on the net. Eventually we decided to
make it a real association, and in 1996 it was formally founded as a
nonprofit organisation. Since then we have held social meetings,
written our handbook, organized courses and seminars, organized
TransVision and gone to various conferences. Overall, most things run
through volunteer work, which keeps costs down but makes progress
slow. This is why we are currently implementing Aleph as a separate
organisation from STHF, a for-profit mini-think tank intended to
stimulate transhuman activity by giving members a chance to earn money
on writing and teaching.
