Sunah, your post is almost poetic.  Thanks!  Yes, people have painted
and danced and sung, however, how does anyone know what it is
like to be themselves if they have never been anyone else?  How to
compare?

<p>
Now that I think it over however, there are those who claim to
have changed so much, it is as if they are a different person.  Examples:
former addicts.  Former alcoholics.  Religious born-agains.  Accident
victims.  These folks can all come up with a good description of how
they once were, and contrast how they are now.  Wouldnt it be
cool to be one of these examples and be able to switch yourself
back and forth?  spike
