For everyone who has contributed to broadening the understanding of the 
religions discussed previously, thank you.

<p>
Out of all the religions I've come across I've come to the conclusion that 
the one I could actually tolerate would be Unitarian.  That's not to say I'm 
announcing my faith as a Unitarian. I'm still very much Atheist.  What I am 
saying is that I've found reason not to discriminate against religion.

<p>
<a name="3179qlink1">"We uphold the free search for truth.  We will not be bound by a statement <br>
of belief.  We do not ask anyone to subscribe to a creed."

<p>
"Human understanding of life and death, the world and its mysteries, is <br>
never final."

<p>
So, it seems that not all religious people are ignoramuses after all.</a>
