<a name="3829qlink1">Following is a snippet of a news item that was forwarded to me.  I have no citation, no way to verify this, and was wondering if someone in Europe had heard about this.  It supposedly happened in Germany.

(Weekly World News) - A man with both male and female sex organs gave
<a name="3826qlink1">birth to a healthy 4 pound, 7 ounce baby in Germany last year.
Hermaphrodite Karl Holzer accidentally fertilized his own egg and
nine months later became the proud mother and father of Hans. "I
always wanted to have a baby but I didn't really expect to have one
until I found out I was pregnant in November 1998," Holzer says. "Now
I'm both the mother and father. I'm floating on cloud nine." Holzer's
baby was born by cesarean section six weeks prematurely.</a>
