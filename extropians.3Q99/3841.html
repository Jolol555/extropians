The nice thing about interdependence is you can make boatloads of
money selling the stuff people need :-) In fact, probably the only
way to achieve anything like autarky (is that a real word?) for
yourself is to build up enough personal assets (these come in many
forms, from intellectual and physical abilities to pure cash) to
survive in the environments you choose. But you're right, the
hardest part by far is not amassing the assets, but rather actually
deciding to partition yourself off from society.. it sounds like
it would be fun, but really it isn't... maybe if there was a really
good telepresence/VR system like in Aristoi...
