<a href="1296.html#1686qlink1">    &gt;The evolution of human intelligence had nothing to do with tool use,</a><br>
<i>    &gt;IMHO.  Human intelligence was the result of social competition for mates.</i><br>
</a>

<p>
<a name="1696qlink2"><a name="1691qlink1">I don't think so, all animals have social competition for mates, but</a> only humans
<a name="1696qlink3">evolved intelligence. I think it's because we have two free limbs and
so have the most important tool of all, the hand, without</a> it intelligence wouldn't
<a name="1696qlink4">be as important as it is; a much more intelligent deer wouldn't have</a> a much greater
</a>
<a name="1691qlink2">survival rate. The fossil record gives some support for my claim,</a> 3 million years ago
<a name="1696qlink5"><a name="1691qlink3">Lucy was fully bipedal and had a hand with a opposable thumb, but</a> her brain wasn't
</a>
<a name="1696qlink6"><a name="1691qlink4">much bigger than that in a modern chimpanzee.

<p>
Bipedalism is important because a hand that's good at locomotion is not
good at manipulating objects, but why did we become bipedal? Evolution
has no foresight so a desire of a big brain can't be the reason humans
walked upright,  there are lots of theories but nobody knows  for sure.</a>
