Elizabeth, could you elaborate on the rationale for the underlined items
a bit when you have the opportunity?</a>

<p>
  There's no doubt that the US federal and local governments do in fact
<br>
<a href="3958.html#3965qlink3">&gt; make the lot of its poorest citizens far worse with things like</a><br>
<i>&gt; taxi licenses, cosmetology licensing, violence from the drug war, etc.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4094qlink1">I believe most licensing is handled locally, so in theory you should
have the opportunity to correct it locally.  Presumably most of this
is done in the name of public safety.  For example today's news
</a>
discussing ~600 people getting sick on E. coli from food contamination
at a New York State Fair.  Last night the Seattle news discussed the
opening of the Washington State fair that had implemented a large
number of "corrective actions", like hand washing stations,
regulations regarding where &amp; what you can pet, food preparation, etc.
because we had a similar disease outbreak here last year.

<p>
<a name="3966qlink1">I know that libertarians believe that these things should be handled
by independent contractors and not by government but if they are then
someone has to pay for the training/oversight/testing, etc.  That
someone is going to be the fair participants, so presumably you end
up harming to some degree the people who you were trying to protect
from the tyranny of government (because the tickets are now more
expensive).
</a>

<p>
<a name="4094qlink2"><a name="3966qlink2">It would appear that a flaw in the libertarian approach is that
in some cases, the government simply "passing a law" *is* the
cheapest way to implement something.  People acting in their own
</a>
self-interest, will find the most efficient way to satisfy the
law and increase public safety.  On the other hand if you have
the government manage the thing, it is bound to wind up inefficient.
This only ends up getting mucked up when the incentives to cheat
are really high like they are in the meat packing industry.
