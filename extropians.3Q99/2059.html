<a href="2047.html#2059qlink1">&gt;If he had attained enlightenment, then the book would likely have been</a><br>
<i>&gt;filled with blank pages. So it might be good that he hasn't :-)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is one of those great book that starts a field. It is not the last</i><br>
<i>&gt;word, and I guess in the end most of the ideas and conclusions Austin</i><br>
<i>&gt;makes will be proven wrong - but in the process a new understanding</i><br>
<i>&gt;will have occured.</i><br>

<p>
If Austin had attained enlightenment, someone else would likely have written
the book (but a different book). If someone as erudite and energetic as
yourself ever attains enlightenment, expect supra-human and poetic
magnificence so potent it shall enchant all sentient beings.
J. R. will read Austin's great book, not to understand his ideas and
conclusions (whether or not proven wrong), but to enrich our (extropic)
meditations beyond enlightenment.

May you live in eternity's sunrise, on the seashore of endless worlds.

"The life of every man is a diary in which he means to write one story, and
writes another; and his humblest hour is when he compares the volume as it
is with what he vowed to make it."

-- James Barrie (Scottish novelist, who wrote the play Peter Pan in 1904)
