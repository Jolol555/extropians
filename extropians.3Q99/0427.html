	...all these extra features add bloat.  This is equally true of
commercial software and the
<br>
<i>&gt; open source community.  A move to component-based software could remedy</i><br>
&gt; this.<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<br>
<a name="0430qlink1">I don't agree with this. If there's one thing that componentware will be
it's bloatware. See, it's unlikely that you'll find a set of components that
service your system requirements alone, and no more.</a> In fact you would have
to be lucky as hell. In fact, each new component introduced into the system
will bring another package of unnecessary functionality delivered with the
component, but not required by the application. Also - components will be
distributed as open source/object code no doubt (after all, they are now).
Shaving the application would be extremely laborious (unreasonable) if the
app was composed completely of third-party components.
