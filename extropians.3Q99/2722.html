The reason I left the cryonics organization I joined in the '70's - the main 
reason - was that the guy running the show made me seriously worried about 
that very outcome.  He was arrogand enough, before he figured out how much 
it was costing him, to tell all comers that he wasn't content to be one SI 
among many superhumans.  He planned to take over the whole show.  Some 
readers will probably recognize of whom I speak.  I took him seriously then 
and he behaved consistent with that attitude until he created some disasters 
for the organization he lead and ended up resigning in disgrace - but that 
was about a decade later.

<i>&gt;Good ideas, Phil.</i><br>
<i>&gt;So good that I'd speculate a few SIs would take over a network Utopia and</i><br>
<i>&gt;make outlaws (or quisling sycophants) of all lesser beings (such as me).</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps many people wouldn't mind living as outlaws, except for residual</i><br>
<i>&gt;resentment toward the higher-living SI's pets.</i><br>
