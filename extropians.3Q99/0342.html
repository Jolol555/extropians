I couldn't agree more!  I honestly think my generation (I'm 23) will be one 
of the first to reap the benefits of some of the staggeringly complex 
biomedical leaps that are in the works.  My taste in science fiction has 
changed (not "matured," by any means) from an interest in hard science to 
more "literary" sf (whatever the hell that means).

<p>
"The Diamond Age" is a fabulous book about a future that I can actually see 
happening.  "Holy Fire" by Bruce Sterling is another with this quality (which 
is rarer than some might think).  Other "hard" sf novels that have seeded me 
with progressive ideas: "Red Mars" by Kim Stanley Robinson, "Timescape" by 
Gregory Benford, "Childhood's End" by Arthur C. Clarke, "Sterling's 
"Schismatrix"...these are books that seethe with thought-food--and they're of 
"literary" quality to boot.

<p>
Lately I've been reading a lot of J.G. Ballard.  Steve Erickson 
("Amnesiascope") is another author with an appropriately millennial 
perspective.

<p>
<a name="0369qlink1">Sagan's "Cosmos" turned me on to popular science writing more than any other 
single book; now I read a great deal of nonfiction on science/culture.  One 
of the best I've read recently is Mark Dery's "Escape Velocity."  Alex 
Heard's "Apocalypse Pretty Soon" follows a similar theme (and it's 
hilarious), though it equates cryonics and transhumanism as some form of 
misguided millennial hysteria.  At least that's what I got out of Heard's 
commentary; I'm willing to forgive him, as his book is quite blatantly a 
personal take on things, and he makes no real attempt to speak on behalf of 
"reason" for all of us.</a>
