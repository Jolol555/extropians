An interesting question John, aside from your main point about a restaurant
or club.<a name="5178qlink2">  If you had investments made before you were frozen, then reanimated,
you would need to wrest the dough from the yahoo who thinks he owns it,
since you, of course, were dead and frozen.  I have decided to not worry
about investments and hope that the future world is Star Trekish enough
that people do not need money.  spike
