I didn't read the recent threads on extinction and planetary defense, now I 
wish I had. Definite food for thought here. However, I think a few of the 
connections made in the story are strained.

<p>
Boyd refers to an event in 535 AD as precipitating the dark ages:

<p>
"The last such global crisis occurred between AD 530 and 540 -- at the 
beginning of the Dark Ages in Europe -- when Earth was pummeled by a swarm of 
cosmic debris."

<p>
This is the only support offered for the "cometary hypothesis" of the fall of 
Rome -- but the Empire was stone dead two generations before the event.

<p>
He lists 3200 BC as the time of an event that destroyed civilizations -- I 
was just reading about a crisis in the middle Neolithic in Britain, which 
*ended* about then, with a resurgence in monument building and an increase in 
population and agricultural output. That is not to say that some other areas 
(Egypt? Babylon?) weren't more affected.  

<p>
Still, the modern world is probably more vulnerable than the ancient world 
was to events of this magnitude, with the much greater population and 
urbanization. Perhaps it's time to start a Space Crud Deflection Foundation. 
Or I could start a company to sell extinction insurance :-)
