<p>
I've not read of this particular example, but I want to make a few comments.

<p>
First, I agree that Aristotle's style leaves a lot to be desired.  The
accepted explanation for this is that his surviving works are basically
lecture notes and not polished tomes intended to be read by others.  Still,
this explanation does not make them any easier to read.:)

<p>
Still, this does not mean his works are free of any insight.  See "Toward an
Esthetics of Horror," "Lovecraft Again," "Interesting Parallels," and
"Remarks on Objectivism: The Philosophy of Ayn Rand" at
<a href="http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/">http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/</a> for some examples of these.  More below.

<p>
Next, I would not rely too much on Russell, given that in the first work
cited, you find out more about Russell's views on issues than on the history
of philosophy.  He's a very biased reader.  Also, if you can't go to the
primary source, then you should just state that the example used comes from
a secondary source up front.  (I bring this up because Tundra Wind (in _The
Connection_) once argued that Aristotle's philosophy had nothing to say
about change -- that it was static and made for a static world.  Anyone who
has actually read _Metaphysics_, _Physics_, _Poetics_, Nicomachean Ethics_,
and _Generation of Animals_ would see that Tundra was wrong.  Aristotle had
a lot to say about change and a large part of his philosophy is an attempt
to deal with change -- as opposed to fence it in as Plato did, call it
illusion as Parmenides did, or worship it as Heraclitus did.  I'm
oversimplifying a bit here only to make a point.:)

<p>
And to condemn Aristotle for not being into the experimental method is a bit
anachronistic.  No one in his time was doing the kind of stuff that later
became the hallmark of modern science.  Even so, Aristotle's method is not
as bad as one might think.  He generally had an empirical bent (see his
works on biology, of which John Clark seems aware), though the step was
generally to go from observation to theorizing about the observation without
any rigorous testing.

<p>
Also, in other of his works, e.g., _Metaphysics_, one can see that he took
the time to try to understand other thinkers -- as opposed to Plato who
generally uses other thinkers and their beliefs as foils.  (Not to damn
Plato too harshly.  I do think he was trying to seek the truth too.)

<p>
Finally, we should be wary of attacking a thinker based on a position he or
she holds and ask why they hold that position instead.  It's the question of
method which is more important.  We should ask: Do his or her methods lead
to correct conclusions? -- rather than exclaiming, Wow, that was a stupid
view, therefore I won't bother learning anything from him or her!

<p>
Cheers!
