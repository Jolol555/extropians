Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVES: Recent experimental studies have suggested that isoflavones (such
  as genistein and daidzein) found in some soy products may
  reduce the risk of cancer. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the
  relationship between soy milk, a beverage
  containing isoflavones, and prostate cancer incidence. METHODS: A prospective
  study with 225 incident cases of prostate cancer in 12,395 California
  Seventh-Day Adventist men who in 1976 stated how often they drank
  soy milk. RESULTS: Frequent consumption
<br>
  (more than once a day) of soy milk was<br>
  associated with 70 per cent reduction of the risk of prostate cancer
<br>
  (relative risk = 0.3, 95 percent confidence interval 0.1-1.0, p-value for<br>
  linear trend = 0.03). The association was upheld when extensive adjustments
  were performed. CONCLUSIONS: Our study suggests that men with high
  consumption of soy milk are at reduced risk
  of prostate cancer. Possible associations between soy bean
  products, isoflavones and prostate cancer risk should be further
  investigated.
