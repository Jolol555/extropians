<a name="3129qlink1">I think parents should have the right to teach their children anything
that they wish.  The only "line" that should be drawn is that of
violence.  Neighbors, family, or as the last resort, the government
should remove children from abusive parents.

<p>
If parents wish to teach their children to hate their fellow humans,
they will simpy raise children who will be unable to compete
succesfully in the world.  That's fewer adults for my son to compete
with in the workplace when he gets out of college.  As long as my son
can retain the right to defend himself from satanists and nazis, I
don't have a problem with parents doing such silly stuff.  

<p>
Besides, humans are very resilient and when the children of satanists
or nazis enter into the real world, they will probably quickly realize
that their belief systems hinder their interactions with others.  They
will either change their belief systems (a lot of us Extropians used</a> to
be socialist christians - I was), or they will spend the rest of their
days drinking beer at the trailer park railing against god or "the man"
or whatever.

<a name="3129qlink2">Thank you for giving all of us Extropians an excellent reminder of why
we're Extropians and not simply transhumanists.</a>
