<a name="1670qlink1">It is essential in science to *first* get the facts and then decide what they mean.
The many double-blind studies (and other evidence) says there are facts.  If
they don't fit our theories, then our theories are inadequate.</a>

<p>
I don't know why it works.  And as I've said, I am not convinced by the theories
I've seen.  But take a look for yourself.  Some of the web links point to theories
that are at least as reasonable as Tipler's (who never persuaded me either).
