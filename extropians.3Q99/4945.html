<a href="4880.html#4945qlink1"> &gt; A very interesting article is available online from Atlantic Monthly</a><br>
<i> &gt; at <a href="http://www.theAtlantic.com/atlantic/issues/current/9909dow.htm">http://www.theAtlantic.com/atlantic/issues/current/9909dow.htm</a>.</i><br>
<i> &gt; (The article is in three parts, and the 2nd and 3rd parts are the more</i><br>
<i> &gt; informative sections.)</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; The authors analyze stock market prices using basic techniques of</i><br>
<i> &gt; expected income stream and also risk premiums, and conclude that</i><br>
<i> &gt; stocks are actually extremely UNDERvalued today (and always have been).</i><br>
<i> &gt; By their model the Dow ought to be running at 36,000 or even more.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4977qlink1">I read part of that article.  They were saying that "the value of a stock
<a name="4977qlink2">is the money it will bring you."  It seemed to me that they were saying
</a>
the proper value /today/ for a stock would be the sum of all the money it
</a>
<a name="4977qlink3">would bring you in the future.  This is pretending that the economy is
static and there is no such thing as growth.  It doesn't even
</a>
make sense, because then the value of any investment is infinite if
you look far enough into the future.  I stopped reading at that point.
