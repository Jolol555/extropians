<i>&gt; I don't think you can dismiss the "superintelligent aliens are all around</i><br>

<i>&gt; (SSGs, also Super Smart Gals) - messing aroung in our local vicinity.</i><br>

<a name="0541qlink1">Note -- the evidence doesn't stack up for them messing around in

interfering [regligious miracles &amp; alien abductions excepted].

<a name="0541qlink2">The evidence as I read it, best says, once evolved, a "stand-off-ish"
position is adopted that allows them to inexpensively observe
further evolution.</a>   Not too different from the human approach
to the birds &amp; the bees. [Note, that if the Universe as we see it is
a TV screen, then all bets are off.]

<p>
<a href="0538.html#0540qlink2">&gt; Seriously of course, you cannot work on that basis. Occam's razor remains</a><br>
<i>&gt; the only viable way to interpret measurements of our environment. So we need</i><br>
<i>&gt; to progress on the assumption that no one is out there messing with the</i><br>
<i>&gt; works.</i><br>

<p>
You can argue for an increase "intervention" but then you have
to "bend the Razor" since it requires more thought/energy/ships, etc.
Bending the razor would seem to require that you make an argument
that "SSGs" derive some benefit from interfering that exceeds the cost.

<a href="0538.html#0540qlink3">&gt; Homogenous thinking leads to tyrany - eliminating idiocy breeds new,</a><br>
<i>&gt; stronger forms of stupidity (meme version of the antibiotics problem?)</i><br>

<p>
Good analogy.  What I've been trying to do is to get people to
really engage in the logical consequences of evolution &amp; natural
selection (everyone understands natural selection on a planetary
scale, but few poeple have extended it to a galactic scale).

<p>

<a href="0538.html#0540qlink4">&gt; B5 fans - legions of SSGs orbiting the visible galaxy - does this sound like</a><br>
<i>&gt; the "beyond the rim" where the old ones go? Spooky. I think JMS might just</i><br>
<i>&gt; be an alien plant...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0606qlink1">B5?  JMS?   You lost me.  Tie-downs please...</a>

<p>
<a href="0538.html#0540qlink5">&gt; Is anyone familiar with Larry Niven's short story "The Locusts"?</a><br>

<p>
No, but the subsequent discussion encourages me to read it.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0538.html#0540qlink6">&gt; "Master, I detect a disturbance in the Force"</a><br>

<p>
You've got that right.  As we better understand the the capabilities
of SSGs, the Death Star begins to look appealing.
