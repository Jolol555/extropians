Doctor calls for halt to genetic engineering
Daily News

<p>
THE Government needs to urgently call a moratorium on all genetic
engineering until it can assure people there will be no resultant mutant
foods or seeds, Murupara GP Bernard Conlon says.

<p>
It was critical to protect the integrity of a country's national food supply
and not to allow modified foods or seeds until a large database of
independent research had shown such genetically- engineered products were
safe, Dr Conlon told a public meeting in New Plymouth last night.

<p>
Mad cow disease had united Europe, certainly for a generation or so, against
genetically-engineered seeds or food.

<p>
Europeans were now not accepting the assurances of agro-chemical companies
about the safety of genetic engineering when much of the available research
was done by those same firms.

<p>
Dr Conlon, chairman of the Royal College of General Practitioners'
environmental working party, said there was a lot of uncertainty, some
misinformation, and inadequate independent research.

<p>
"If there was one lesson to be learned (from the mad cow debacle) it is the
foolishness of allowing the possible corruption of the national food
supply."

<p>
Some foods available in New Zealand, usually soya or corn-based processed
foods, already contained genetically modified ingredients. So the Government
needed to act swiftly to ensure specific and comprehensive safeguards.

<p>
"New Zealand is at a crossroads. Five years down the track it will be too
late. Farmers need to think long and hard what direction they wish to take
as their decision will be irreversible."

<p>
It was already possible to genetically coat seeds with a "death sentence" so
they did not reproduce, forcing farmers back to the same seed companies year
after year.

<p>
"People need to decide how much they value the bountifulness of nature, how
much they value God's own country, whether they only pay lip-service to this
concept or are they prepared to take a stand against genetic engineering,"
Dr Conlon said.
