One word: "family".

Strange but true: even the most dedicated anarcho-capitalists don't
usually think too hard about the fact that they live in a communist
institution that relies on cooperation, forcible sharing of property,
and cooercion ("you WILL wash the dishes up or ELSE!"). They don't
even think too hard about forking over their hard-earned capital
to someone else for spending on items of dubious utility, many of
which will be consumed by that person!

(Or, to put it another way: non-coercive communal living, as long as
the perceived benefits outweigh the costs, is something that many
people engage in: it's called marriage. Similarly, it is possible to
envisage other non-coercive communal lifestyles that provide benefits
outweighing the costs. The problem isn't communism; it's coercion.)
