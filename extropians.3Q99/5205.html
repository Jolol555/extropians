Don't worry, Mike; you'll get your chance to legally bag a human 
being yet.  Just continue to watchfully pack as you meander 
through high crime areas late at night.  Just hope that some patrol 
cop doesn't mistake you for one of the more usual 
denizens/predators.  But then again, what's the difference?  You 
AND they would be there looking to take something from someone, 
be it life or wealth.
