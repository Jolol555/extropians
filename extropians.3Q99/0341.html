<a name="0358qlink1">This looks very interesting and I can see that a lot of work has gone into
it.  I feel that there are a couple of problemw right now though.</a>

<p>
The main one is that the topics on which we are asked to comment lack
definitions.  There appears to be room for a topic description, but many
or most of the topics don't have one.

<p>
In some cases this is OK: "AI (Human-Equivalent)" and "Computer Speed
(1 GigaFLOPS)" are pretty clear.  But for others it is not clear what
is meant: "Enhanced Reality", "Haptic Interfaces", "Agency Management"
are ambiguous or confusing.  Is "Expectation of Immortality" when I
expect immortality to be achieved, or when the population as a whole
comes to expect that immortality will someday be possible?

<p>
We are invited to attach comments to the topic title on each page, and
that might be a place where someone could offer a straw man definition
of each concept which would help other readers to make consistent
predictions.  I was concerned about the details of the technology,
though, since there are two occurances of "Enhanced Reality" on the page
for that topic: the title string at the top, but also the list of all
computer related topics at the left.  Is there a need to put in context
information to make sure that our comments get put in the right place?

<p>
In terms of the dates, it might be nice if there were &lt;2000 and &gt;2020
options so that we can record that we don't think the events will occur
in that time frame.

<p>
There seem to be somewhat over 100 topics, which spreads participants
pretty thinly unless you get a lot of participation.  I know you hope to
do so, but it makes it harder to generate a critical mass of commentary
that will invite others to participate.

<p>
Despite these issues, this looks like a great project. I'll jump in and
try to make a few comments, and hopefully others will do so as well.

<p>
