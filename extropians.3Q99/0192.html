<a href="0065.html#0192qlink1">	&gt;Being "weird" is not a bad thing, as nobody wants to be boring or</a><br>
normal.


<p>
	Not boring, no. But normal, yes. In fact, maintaining the pretence
of normality is the mechanism behind the phenomenon of propagation of
outdated and useless traditions, and that which allows such deep and
subconscious programming of your average person. Distracted by the desire to
be normal, your average kid will participate in any ridiculous pantomime
with real zeal, without paying attention to what they're doing or why
they're doing it. By the time they're adult, these things are "normal" and
don't get questioned.
<p>
	The only deviant characteristics humans will tolerate are those that
are seen as sexually attractive in any way - Everyone wants to be special -
not as in "school" or "child", but in terms of being extra-cool, witty,
pretty, deep, passionate etc....
<p>
	I don't know people that want to be "special" in terms of the number
of arms they have.
