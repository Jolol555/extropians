<a href="1143.html#1154qlink1">&gt; I question whether intelligence is so helpful that all mammals evolved</a><br>
<i>&gt; to be as intelligent as possible.  It seems to me that intelligence is</i><br>
<i>&gt; of questionable value in the day to day life of an animal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Consider the life of prehistoric humans.  I don't see why someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; marginally more intelligent than others will have much of an advantage in</i><br>
<i>&gt; hunting or gathering.  Most of what is needed is learned culturally, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; those techniques have been optimized over generations to approximate local</i><br>
<i>&gt; maxima.</i><br>

<p>
Hi Hal,
<br>
Learning things culturally takes intelligence.

<p>
<a href="1143.html#1154qlink2">&gt; Sure, even ten or twenty thousand years someone domesticates</a><br>
<i>&gt; a new animal or discovers fire, but these events are so rare they can't</i><br>
<i>&gt; have any significant evolutionary input.</i><br>

<p>
The discovery of fire is a good example.  Fire was probably discovered a large
number of times before the invention caught on.  And when it did catch on, I
imagine that for quite a few generations, that the leading cause of death was
fire safety related.  Until the point that people too stupid to use fire
safely were weeded out of the population.

<p>
<a href="1143.html#1154qlink3">&gt; My feeling is that people stumbled onto some cultural and physical</a><br>
<i>&gt; changes which set up specific incentives for greater intelligence -</i><br>
<i>&gt; bipedalism, the use of spears, fire, tools, etc.  This brought us up to</i><br>
<i>&gt; IQ 100.  But that was smart enough for these purposes.  IQs of 130 or</i><br>
<i>&gt; 150 wouldn't make someone any better at using these tools.</i><br>

<p>
I agree.
