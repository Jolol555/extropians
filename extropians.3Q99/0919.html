<a href="0915.html#0919qlink1">&gt; &gt; Don't get [phil osborn] started.  Most women seem to have an</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; underlying...[snip]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ...rant, rant, rant - you can fill in the blanks from here, as I know that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; most</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; men have had these experiences...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This whole thread went off in a direction I never intended.  Ah, the magic</i><br>
<i>&gt; of a web discussion!  {8^D  Perhaps I should have specified I meant</i><br>
<i>&gt; chimps.  Less emotional baggage [that we all carry] from unsuccessful</i><br>
<i>&gt; relationships, broken hearts, etc.  Humans are too complicated.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0925qlink1"><i>&gt; That said, what I am really looking at here is the implications of mating</i><br>
<i>&gt; behavior to evolution, the future of the race, etc.  Consider the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; humans vs the very similar chimps.  The first humans likely had the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mutation of a straight leg: they could lock the knee and walk on two</i><br>
<i>&gt; legs much more easily than the chimps.  This mutation freed the hands</i><br>
<i>&gt; to manipulate objects.<a name="0924qlink1">  The critical factor is that being able to manipulate</i><br>
<i>&gt; objects caused the smarter protohumans to have a survival advantage</i><br>
<i>&gt; over dumber protohumans, whereas it is not clear to me that the smarter</i><br>
<i>&gt; chimps have any real reproductive advantage over dumber chimps.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Don't forget opposable thumbs (allowing grasping and making tool 
manufacture and use an evolutionary possible positive to develop),</a> 
</a>
<a name="0924qlink2">improved speaking systems (tongue/jaw/larnyx configurations 
permitting the pronunciation of deeper vowel sounds, such as o and 
u, and the subsequent proliferation of possible distinguishable 
sounds to which could be attached meanings),</a> and neoteny (which 
<a name="0924qlink3">allowed the bigger brains to finish growing postbirth (after passing 
through a vaginal canal which would still manage to be 
pleasureable for the male to fuck later so he would continue to 
hang around to help provide for his offspring,</a> while allowing the 
pelvic girdle to continue to efficiently perform its architectural 
functions).
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0915.html#0919qlink2">&gt; I am way out of my field here, so biologists, please help me out.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This factor would cause the humans to gradually become smarter,</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a group, whereas the chimps went right along eating termites</i><br>
<i>&gt; and doing their chimp things.  Isnt that kinda the way it works?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Nowthen, fast forward to present day.  Humans have been intelligent</i><br>
<i>&gt; now for at least 50k years.  We have developed the technologies</i><br>
<i>&gt; critical to our survival.  What I am driving at with the whole brains</i><br>
<i>&gt; vs buns thing is that there may have been subtle influences that</i><br>
<i>&gt; slightly favored brains, but this influences were subtle indeed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Now however, it seems society has created a system which gives</i><br>
<i>&gt; an *enormous* reproductive advantage... to being stupid!  Our</i><br>
<i>&gt; welfare system encourages overbreeding by those who cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; take care of themselves, overbreeding by those who put their</i><br>
<i>&gt; faith in a church that urges them to be fruitful and multiply,</i><br>
<i>&gt; overbreeding by those who are drug addicts, etc.  [Natasha</i><br>
<i>&gt; *almost* went here I think with her carefully worded comments</i><br>
<i>&gt; on teenage pregnancies.]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Those who you and I might agree are the most fit for the future</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduce only modestly, if it all.  My burden is this: all those</i><br>
<i>&gt; influences that shaped humankind in past millenia were subtle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Modern influences by comparison are overwhelming and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; implications to our species profound.  spike</i><br>
