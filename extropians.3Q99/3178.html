<a href="2982.html#3178qlink1"> &gt; The basic, repeated, complaint is that dynamic, intelligent women who have</a><br>

Well, I personally didn't have to read that thread, having a real
mailreader and all, so I don't know whether or not it was blatantly
ignorant.  But if we've got blatantly ignorant offensive posts, then I
say send 'em up the river.  Ban the topic for two weeks.  Kick the
offenders off the list for a month.  Understand, I don't approve of
censoring intelligent discussion no matter who it offends, but I also
happen to believe that this list is for smart posts and that dumb posts
should be summarily dealt with if they become systematic, annoying, or
start having a detrimental effect on list quality.

<p>
If Neanderthal posts on this list are driving away female Extropians,
then maybe we should ban discussion of dating.<a name="3316qlink1">  And maybe we should even
create a set of "easily-abused" topics like gender differentials, in
which posting on the subject makes you liable to summary judgement of
scientific illiteracy, resulting in one warning followed by unsubscription.</a>

<p>
Oh, who am I kidding.  The list moderators are never going to do this.
