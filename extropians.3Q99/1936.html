There was a discussion of iqtest.com a few months ago.  You could check the
archives.  We concluded that they were intentionally fudging results up
about 15 points, a full standard deviation.  Which would still give you an
IQ of 137, if that test actually measures IQ in the same way that other IQ
tests do.  137 is still quite good.

<p>
I don't think iqtest.com is offering a test that would be recognized by most
psychologists as a "real" IQ test.  The standard, accepted tests have been
widely tested over a long period and subject to intense peer review, which I
don't think their tests have been.

<p>
All that said, I wouldn't take it too seriously.  It's how you use it.

<p>
Some college degrees can be great for advancing your career, but the
statistics show that getting a degree in the humanities won't help much if
at all:

<p>
As a successful college dropout, I agree that a degree or lack thereof is
not proof or disproof of intelligence.

True story:  The Zen Center decided to have a fundraiser.  They contacted
one of the
<br>
most famous Zenmasters in the world, and flew him in from Korea to give a
talk.
<br>
They invited hundreds of people, all of whom paid money to see him talk.

<p>
He went up to the podium, said "You are all going to die," and left.

<a href="1923.html#1936qlink1">&gt; I received a score of 156 from the cesnet site and 152 from iqtest.com. I</a><br>
went
<br>
<a href="1923.html#1936qlink2">&gt; ahead and paid for the comprehensive results from iqtest.com as I have</a><br>
never
<br>
<a href="1923.html#1936qlink3">&gt; taken an IQ test and I was wondering what various components of such a</a><br>
test
<br>
<a href="1923.html#1936qlink4">&gt; would entail or indicate.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I must say that although it was a bit interesting, the whole experience</i><br>
was
<br>
<a href="1923.html#1936qlink5">&gt; rather uneventful and lacked the "test excitement" I had always enjoyed in</a><br>
the
<br>
<a href="1923.html#1936qlink6">&gt; past. At least now I have an idea what my IQ is and what potential I</a><br>
missed out
<br>
<a href="1923.html#1936qlink7">&gt; on by not finishing college. = (</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I can now live with the satisfaction that a college degree does NOT always</i><br>
<i>&gt; engender intelligence in a person or prove that they are smatter than an</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual who does not have a degree. All a degree says is a person</i><br>
completed a
<br>
<a href="1923.html#1936qlink8">&gt; curriculum of study from an accredited university and knows something</a><br>
about a
<br>
<a href="1923.html#1936qlink9">&gt; particular subject. I still plan on getting a degree eventually, just so I</a><br>
can

<a href="1923.html#1936qlink10">&gt; advance further in both my career and sallary expectations. Long live the</a><br>
