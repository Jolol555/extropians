Went to a Unitarian "church" for a while.  They believe (if you can call
it that) that belief is a matter of individual conscience.  There is a lot
of variety, but this one was so concerned about offending anyone that it
rarely even used the "G" word (and the convolutions involved sent me and
my wife into peals of supressed giggling).  It seemed mostly peopled by
those who had lost their faith, but still wanted the trappings and social
group of a church.  Makes an interesting case study in memetics.
