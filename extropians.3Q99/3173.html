<p>
Eeek, someone who really understands how the system works.  I stand
corrected on the total possible power.  I'd stick by my belief
<a name="3234qlink1">that most homes don't come close to using this (I suppose I could
figure it out from my electric bill).</a></a>

<p>
My table says 1374, so either one is probably correct.  You do get somewhat
less at the surface due to scattering and dispersion in the atmosphere.
You might get close to that at noon at the equator.  Perhaps mine is
the above the atmosphere #, and yours is the noontime equatorial #.

<a href="3156.html#3173qlink4">&gt; Earth is 6.37x10^6 m.</a><br>

<p>
Yep, 6,378 km.

<p>
<a href="3156.html#3173qlink5">&gt; &gt;  Multiply that out, divide by 3 billion people, and you </a><br>

<p>
Not without distorting the weather or killing plants and animals
(and whatever humans choose to live "off of" them).

<a name="3326qlink2"><a name="3234qlink2"><a href="3165.html#3173qlink7">&gt; Those numbers work out to 5.7x10^4 KW per person, modeling the earth</a> as a</a><br>

<a name="3234qlink4">We must be using different calculators because when I take

   Insolation*Pi*R_earth^2 / 6*10^9

I get 2.93*10^7.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3182qlink1">That is what Hal has been complaining about, he wants the difference
between the NM limit of ~10^4 W (10kg of nanobots) and ~10^7 W.
Those 3 orders of magnitude let him build that mansion much faster.
[Of course if he gets the entire power budget, we don't have any plants
and very few animals left.]

<p>
<a name="3326qlink4">I would generally agree with Hal, in that I think we can get almost
an order of magnitude more power without too much trouble.
More than that and it is going to start creating problems
until we have a lot of computer power to simulate the potential
effects.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3326qlink5"><a name="3182qlink2">But I suspect you can get probably 2-4 orders of magnitude
better by doing more efficient assembly (i.e. chemical reactions
that utilize/reuse the free energy effectively), reusing building
blocks (so once you have invested in building them, you don't rebuild
them) and going to more efficient nanodesigns.  So we are probably
wasting mental energy on the wrong side of the problem.
