Obviously you cannot power a vehicle on a fuel in a low energy state.
Water is a low energy state unless you have an even lower energy
state compund to convert it into.  Methane is a low energy state
in an atmosphere without any free oxygen.

<p>
Yes, ultimately everything runs on free energy inputs (e.g.
sunlight, radioactive decay, gravitational contraction, etc.)
to provide the energy for chemical reactions.

<p>
In our environment you have to use sunlight to drive water
"uphill", so you have hydrogen to oxidize to release energy.
So, yes, everything really is powered by sunlight (except
that small percentage of things powered by leftover power
from radiation and/or gravitational contraction leading to
plate tectonics and/or the release of energy from molten
materials.

  The result would be a car
<br>
<a href="2591.html#2601qlink2">&gt; that has to spend several hours recharging for every hour of use, which</a><br>

I've gone about a year without ever having to drive a vehicle
<a name="5076qlink3">for more than an hour.</a>  Your use of a vehicles capacity depends
on the requirement for that capacity.   Most people don't buy
a means of trasporatation because it can travel 8 hours without
refueling.

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; there are still technical hurdles that need to be overcome before such</i><br>
<i>&gt; production will be practical, and it is not at all clear that the overall</i><br>
<i>&gt; production cost would be lower.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
The "rule-of-thumb", which I will admit is very gross, is that
every time the quantity manufacutured "doubles", the cost declines
by a factor of two.

<p>
It would be a worthwhile exercise to explore this prediction
in such diverse areas as floopy disk drives, microprocessors
and solar cells.   My gut level "feeling" is that there
is some truth in the statement, though it may vary from
industry to industry.
