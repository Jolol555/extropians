<a name="3452qlink3">I don't think we disagree here.  What I was trying to say was that
they have to be *specific* for increases in expression.  Changing
a GC to a CG may increase expression, while changing a GC to an AT

<p>
yes.  The number of mutations away from the optimal situation
is probably much higher than the number of mutations that
improve on an already "good" situation.

<p>
<a name="3452qlink4"><a href="3402.html#3416qlink4">&gt; many regulators are repressors.</a> Most regulatory regions are</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3452qlink5">I think we would have to discuss this more carefully.  While
in bacterial genomes I might agree that repressors tend to be
more common, I suspect that in higher organisms, promoters
would tend to be the dominant factors.</a>  I suspect we need
more information to know this for certain.

<a href="3402.html#3416qlink5">&gt; Variation in regulatory regions is turning out to be quite common</a><br>
<i>&gt; and seems to underly most natural quantitative genetic variation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I wouldn't say "most", since statistically the genes are *much*
larger than the regulatory regions, so there will be more variation
in the genes than in the regulatory regions.  Now whether this
balances out in terms of mutations in gene "critical regions" being
roughly equivalent to mutations in the "regulatory regions" (in
terms of a rough equivalence in the number of bases) I suspect
is an open question.

<p>
I would say that *most* of the quantitative genetic variation
that I have seen to date involves mutations in the gene coding
regions.  I would allow that there are selection biases that
may be creating that impression, so we would need a lot more
work to determine whether that is the reality.
