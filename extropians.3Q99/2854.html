<a name="2860qlink1">I find this subject fascinating. Just one question: how do I measure m2? Is that the surface area of my skin, and if so, how could I get a ballpark estimate without, like, putting duct tape all over myself, cutting it off and measuring its area?</a>

<i>   &gt;Chubby old people seem to do well in the longevity sweapstakes.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;This seems to fit in with other research which associates risk factors </i><br>
<i>   &gt;such as low cardioresipratory fitness, and high blood pressure as being</i><br>
<i>   &gt;responsible for higher mortality in young people at either end of the BMI</i><br>
<i>   &gt;scale. These would tend to die early, yielding mostly survivors that are</i><br>
<i>   &gt;relatively healthy regardless of BMI. </i><br>
<i>   &gt; The "U" or "J" relation found in most studies relating human mortality</i><br>
<i>   &gt;with body weight, thus tends to naturally flatten out at progressively</i><br>
<i>   &gt;older ages.</i><br>

<i>   &gt;  Body mass index and</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  all-cause mortality among people age 70 and over: the</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  Longitudinal Study of Aging.</i><br>

<i>   &gt;  21(6):424-31, 1997 Jun.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;Abstract</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  OBJECTIVES: To assess the relationship between body</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  mass index (BMI; kg/m2) and</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  mortality in a large nationally representative sample of US</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  adults over age 70 years. DESIGN: Prospective longitudinal cohort study, the</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA). Subjects were all those 7260 black and</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  white people (2769 men, 4491 women) initially interviewed in 1984 for whom</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  height and weight were available. These subjects were followed through to</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  1990. MEASUREMENTS: Measurements included self-reported height and weight,</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  date of death if subjects died, sex, age, race, measures of socio-economic</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  status, number of living first degree relatives, and responses to questions</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  asking whether the subject had retired due to poor health, had difficulty</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  eating, worried about their health, and felt their health was worse than</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  during the prior year. Smoking status was not assessed. RESULTS: When</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  analyzed via Cox proportional hazard regression, the relationship between BMI</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  and mortality, represented by means of hazard ratio, was</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  clearly U-shaped for both men and women. The base of the curves was fairly</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  wide suggesting that a broad range of BMIs are well tolerated by older</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  adults. The minimum mortality (estimated from the fitted</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  proportional hazard models) occurred at a BMI of approximately 31.7 for women</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  and 28.8 for men. The results were essentially unchanged, if analyses were</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  weighted, if various disease states were controlled for, and if apparently</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  unhealthy subjects were excluded. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of the relatively</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  high BMI (27-30 for men, 30-35 for women) associated with minimum hazard in</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  persons older than seventy years supports some previously documented findings</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  and opposes others and, if confirmed in future research, has implications for</i><br>
<i>   &gt;  public health and clinical recommendations.</i><br>
