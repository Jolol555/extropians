<p>
What you say is true, but what does that have to do with free will?

<p>
    &gt; A system or entity can be utterly Godelianly epistemicly indeterminate,
    &gt;and still might be *physically* determinate down to a micro-level.

<p>
It's not forbidden by Godel but it is by Heisenberg, of course this is irrelevant
to what we've been discussing..

<pre>
    &gt;Quantum-level uncertainty/randomness does nothing for the cause
    &gt;of free-will, either, without some theory linking it (say) to some sort
    &gt;of *agent-causation*

</pre>
<p>
That wouldn't help in the slightest, It'd just push the problem upstairs.

<p>
    &gt;What is needed is a robust theory of agent-causation which takes into
    &gt;account--indeed, incorporates--state-of-the-art quantum-cosmology

<p>
<a name="2221qlink3">Why do we need that? If the agent does what it does because of cause and
effect then it's a machine, if not then it's random,</a> so what have you gained?
Zip.
