There is this element, to be sure.  I don't think that artists are swayed
by what's "hot' but more by what advances and changes are occurring
throughout culture.  Keeping in mind that artists are trained to inquire
into the social mechanism of culture and translate the information into
varied artistic modes.  There is also an element of personal choice,
interest and observation which draws on an artist's creativity and
introspection.
