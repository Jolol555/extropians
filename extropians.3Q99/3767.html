<a name="3827qlink2">Speaking as an American pragmatist, ;), I feel that I have to step forward
and defend the theory.  I think you're either misunderstanding a given
pragmatist's argument or else you're approaching it from a very funny
angle.</a>

<p>
<a name="3827qlink3">Asking "what is valid/true" doesn't ask the really important question, the
pragmatist argues; instead of asking "what is true," we should ask "what
should we believe?"</a>  Of course, one simple answer to that might be "all
and only true things," which leads us to try to figure out what things may
or may not be true.

<p>
However, this answer may not be the best answer we can give; if you happen
to be a utilitarian/pragmatist, your answer will be "you should believe x
iff believing in x will maximize utility." As many pragmatists and many
critics of pragmatism are fond of pointing out, despite the fact that the
utilitarian answer and the simple answer will probably overlap a great
deal, they probably don't overlap 100%.

<p>
<a name="3788qlink1">It seems to me that you've interpreted pragmatism to be a theory of
necessary and sufficient conditions for something to be valid/true, which,
I'd argue, no sane pragmatist would actually claim to do.  Indeed, any
theory of truth which establishes necessary and sufficient criteria for
something to be true is inherently circular.<a name="3827qlink4">  Pragmatism isn't a theory of
truth.  It is a theory about what we should believe, which grounds itself
in the philosophy of ethics.</a></a>
