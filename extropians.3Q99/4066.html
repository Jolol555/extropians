<i>&gt;Sunah, your post is almost poetic.  Thanks!  Yes, people have painted</i><br>
<i>&gt;and danced and sung, however, how does anyone know what it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;like to be themselves if they have never been anyone else?  How to</i><br>
<i>&gt;compare?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now that I think it over however, there are those who claim to</i><br>
<i>&gt;have changed so much, it is as if they are a different person.  Examples:</i><br>
<i>&gt;former addicts.  Former alcoholics.  Religious born-agains.  Accident</i><br>
<i>&gt;victims.  These folks can all come up with a good description of how</i><br>
<i>&gt;they once were, and contrast how they are now.  Wouldnt it be</i><br>
<i>&gt;cool to be one of these examples and be able to switch yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;back and forth?</i><br>

well, it's not just that; every time you make a decision the potential you
on the other branch of the decision is someone you will never truly know.
If you want to go regretting all the states you can never truly know you
can knit up a lot of regret, there, cowboy. If you get someone to swap
bodies with you so you can really know what it is like to be a woman, you
will just know what it was like to be you checking it out for whatever
finite time and place, and in the meantime you will miss out on whatever
your usual body would have been up to. This is why I point out that
although you can't really have it all, you get a lot out of the multiple
perspectives you do have access to without the sacrifices you would make
for actual access.
