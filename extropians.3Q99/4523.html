Yes, I do refer to ExI often.  The Mission Statement and FAQ are quite good
don't you find? Also, some of the home pages of BoD and Advisors.  Greg
Burch's page is excellent, but I think you already have that URL by now,
and you can check our www.Transhuman.org for some basics.

<p>
I don't have the time, but Greg Burch has taken the time.  If you still
have difficulty with Greg's response, let's discuss some extropian challenges.
