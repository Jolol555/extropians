Try imagining a split just ABOUT to happen.  During this split, one</a> split
version of you will go on to exist in "Universe A," while the other split
version of you will go on to exist in "Universe B."  From this past
perspective, it obviously doesn't make sense to ask "Why will I perceive A
and not B?" because, in point of fact, you (that is, the unsplit you) will
perceive both (once you split).  Why X?  Not X.

<p>
<a name="2920qlink1">The reason your question is harder to think about after the split is
because when a split version of you thinks about the other split version
of you, the other split version necessarily seems a little less real.
This is not a fact about physics; this is a fact about psychology and the 
way we use language.</a>

<p>
Suppose the A version of you is thinking about the B version of you.  
When the A version says "I," it means the A version and ONLY the A
version; not the B version.  The B version is different from the A
version; since we are very used to the idea that "I" refers to only one
thing and not two different things, it's quite natural to think, right or
wrong, that after the split, you are not the same person as the other
version of you in the other branch.  Since you seem very, very real to
yourself, anything that is not you (in this case, version B) seems
slightly less certain; slightly less real.  [Or, in the case of an
abstract theory like MWI, perhaps far, far less certain/real indeed.]

<p>
<a name="2920qlink2">Now we return to your question, "why do I perceive A and not B?"  I'd
argue that this is because it's very natural for one to think of a person
on one side of the branch as different from the person on the other side
of the branch.  The other version of you is perceiving B, but since that
version isn't "you," "you" aren't perceiving B.  That is why "you"
perceive A and not B.  If you were to call both splits in both branches
"you," which comes quite naturally BEFORE the split, since before the
split both versions DO seem more like yourself, the question would seem
pretty meaningless.</a>
