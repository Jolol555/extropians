Four million tonnes of energy per second is one HELL of a lot of power.

With a really *big* chirped diffraction grating (tens of lightseconds on a
side) you could create attosecond pulses with megatonne mass.</a>  Colliding
<a name="2616qlink5">these pulses[*] should create tidy little black holes. It may require
hundreds or thousands of seconds of the sun's output to make black holes
that have evaporative lifetimes of at least a few years, so that they</a> can
<a name="2616qlink6">be trapped and used.  The energy in the beams must all reach the target
volume in less time than it takes for a photon to traverse the "width" of
the hole.  Yoctosecond timing?</a>

<p>
<a name="2616qlink7">About the best use of black holes is the fact that they don't conserve
baryon number, so you can turn any old mass (even iron) into energy.  The
very high temperature of a black hole would allow very high carnot
efficiency.</a>

[*] to avoid the circular firing squad's dilemma, more than two beams are
<a name="2611qlink1">needed so that missed pulses don't fry the opposite launch optics. Four
beams originating at the corners of a tetrahedron should work... but more
would produce a smoother implosion.  Asymmetries in the implosion will
cause the resultant hole the shoot off in the opposite direction.  Thus two
beams meeting at right angles could create a hole shooting off at .7 c
