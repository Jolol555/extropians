Speaking of which, the local newpaper ran a story Friday
that a young woman had her ovaries removed when she
was in her 20s [because they had cysts].  In order to
keep the scar as small as possible, they went in through
a small hole in her abdomen, sliced the ovaries into pieces
5 to 10 mm and brought them out thru a tube.  For some reason they
froze them.  Now, years later, a doctor sewed the pieces
back together and reimplanted them.  She ovulated.  Im
looking for a URL.  Sounds like a hoax, but they presented
it as truth.  spike
