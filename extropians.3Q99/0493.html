<i>&gt; The Star Wars movie got me to thinking that strong nanotech</i><br>

<i>&gt; much smaller.  I imagined that a number of them could interconnect</i><br>

<i>&gt; billion of them on the surface of a mitochondrion, the mitochondrion</i><br>

<a name="0501qlink1">Hmm.  Yes, you should be able to do usefull amounts of computation without
any problems.  Couple that with passive sensors, and you could have a very
powerful metabolic monitoring system.  Add a few digitally-controlled
ribosomes to the cell and you could do a lot of interesting biological
manipulations.  You could also do a lot of immune system enhancements with
this technology (based on improved ability to detect invaders and
co-ordinate immune responses).</a>
