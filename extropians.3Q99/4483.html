Thank you Carol for this, especially if it becomes an etude.  

<p>
You asked about emotions:  Although I am interested in refined emotions. I
think emotions are essential to our evolution and joy of life, as well as
pain and sorrow.  The emotions that I would like to see enhanced vis a vis
neural enhancements/augments for new pathways is because of sloppy
reasoning and overly extended emotionality that may cause damage and often
irreversible problems.  I am more intellectually and emotionally oriented
than physically oriented, however.  My interests in the transhuman body is
more because I am athletic and involved in extreme life expansion.  I also
see the body as an art form, but it is not my key focus.

<p>
<i>&gt;From my readings, life extension is merely guaranteeing that everyone can</i><br>
<i>&gt;live to the maximum life expectancy of the current physical apparatus ~85</i><br>
<i>&gt;years. Life expansion is taking the current physical apparatus and</i><br>
<i>&gt;increasing that endpoint, perhaps to a total of 200 years given the biology</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the system. AI and SI eliminate the biological opening up new endpoints</i><br>
<i>&gt;and the possibility of infinity to consciousness.</i><br>

<p>
We have a lot of work to do now in extending our lives maximally so I'm
focused on genetic engineering, AI, nanotechnology, whole body prosthetics,
sensorial augmentations, etc.  I think that perhaps others on this list
could better discuss SI.

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt;I hope this helps clarify my vagueness. You are quite unique and so I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;expect your choices to be the unexpected and give me something to ponder.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; Ha!  Sorry to disappoint you.  I'm very clear about taking each step by</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; step in life extension and to continue evolving.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Au contraire! I have never been disappointed by any human I have</i><br>
<i>&gt;encountered.</i><br>

<p>
Well said.  To answer your question as succinctly as I can:  My choices are
basic -- to be live healthfully, understand my body and know how to
converse with my physician, take responsibility for my medication and
surgeries, illnesses and aches and pains, I am involved with cryonics.  A
little further on, start augmenting with machines (AI and Nano) and do a
little tweaking with genetic engineering (somatic) and take each step along
the way as we move father and farther along the ageless incline.

<p>
<i>&gt;And you are an immortalist.</i><br>

<p>
Well, let's say I'm an extreme life extensionist -:)
