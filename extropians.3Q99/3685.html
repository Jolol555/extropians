<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; OK, when was the last time you slaughtered your own cow before</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; eating steak?</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; Despite the fact that none of us tend to do this, the government does </i><br>
<i>&gt;not</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; supply our meat, private industry does.  Libertarianism is not </i><br>
<i>&gt;suggesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; you literally protect yourself it's suggesting you have a choice in who </i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; protect you and what they protect you against.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ok, well that's fine then.  A little competition in providing "government"</i><br>
<i>&gt;services (protection, law, meat inspection) would be a very interesting.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But I think we may get back into the "too much information" problem.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Are you qualified to judge whether U.S.D.A meat inspectors are</i><br>
<i>&gt;better or worse than Elmer &amp; Mo's Clean Meat Verification Services, Inc.?</i><br>
<i>&gt;What about comparing in detail two legal systems such as the U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;system and the French system?</i><br>

<p>
The problem is: why the hell the USDA meat inspectors should be qualified to 
do that job in the first place? There is no guarantee that they will have 
your (or the other customers best interest in mind). This has already been 
discussed by the public choice school.

<a href="3607.html#3685qlink2">&gt;While the idea is attractive, I think the problem is that the devil</a><br>
<i>&gt;is in the details.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Robert</i><br>

<p>
And it is that devil that kills the government since it cannot analyze the 
extremely complex systems of modern society. Most economics show the 
diseconomies of scale of governments and that they have problems to deal 
with complex systems.
