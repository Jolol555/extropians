<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Eghaads, no!  The whole point of more reefs is to enjoy the</i><br>
<i>&gt; beauty of survival-of-the-fittest game.   Provide little</i><br>
<i>&gt; homes for the baby fishes and let them grow up.  If they</i><br>
<i>&gt; are clever enough they escape from the bigger fishes</i><br>
<i>&gt; they get to make more baby fishes.  (I'll admit that we</i><br>
<i>&gt; have distorted things somewhat by creating more "artificial"</i><br>
<i>&gt; environments, but its a fairly passive distortion.)</i><br>

<p>
Well to express my point a little more clearly, what I
meant was to only replicate the fish once.. just get them
started back again. And you could actually get a whole
bunch of samples to replicate.. not just do one particular
fish a million times. Then when you've got them restored
to normalish numbers, let the evolution continue.

<a href="3040.html#3045qlink2">&gt; I believe one of the books about the Physics of Star Trek</a><br>
<i>&gt; (or something similar) points out that classic "transporters"</i><br>
<i>&gt; are difficult or impossible due to the information and</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy requirements.  You definately have a *real* problem</i><br>
<i>&gt; without a receiver at the destination.  Replicators are feasible.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Deconstruction with replication is possible.  Approximate copying based</i><br>
<i>&gt; on intensive internal surveying seems possible as well.  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; moving me atom-by-atom to another place over a carrier wave?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not!  No Magic Physics.</i><br>

<p>
:^) Yeah... I did say "similiar" not exactly like. You would
have to have a base station pre-built, and do a destructive
upload.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="3040.html#3045qlink3">&gt; This does raise an interesting point however in a nanotech</a><br>
<i>&gt; world we will have three very interesting possibilities</i><br>
<i>&gt;   1) Let the Earth return to a "natural" state.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   2) Garden parts or much of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   3) Engineer parts or much of it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Another poll perhaps?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Robert</i><br>

<p>
I vote for: what we have at any given time should be considered
"natural". For instance I think the development of cities and
everything else humans have created is a perfectly natural
extension of the evolution of our brains.
