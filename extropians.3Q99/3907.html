I believe that's just to make joe connective tissue.  The genes involved
in making structures expect to be on in reasonable complex 3-D patterns.
There are hundreds of genes already known to be involved in development
and the number keeps going up.

<p>
All things considered, it might be easier to grow a human hand or kidney
in a tissue-culture situation (actually, attached to some immunotolerant
organism) than to regenerate it in the target.

<p>
<a href="3862.html#3907qlink2">&gt;&gt; For spare parts we need in vitro organs plus reactivation of neural</a><br>

<p>

<p>
I agree with you on this; although virtually everything has and uses neural
connection it seems like a number of internal organs can get by without
it.  I was thinking in terms of your example, hands. Livers, incidentally, 
can 
<br>
already regrow partially in vivo and I expect them to be the first 
replaceable 
<br>
organ.

<a name="3912qlink1"><i>&gt;the insertion of a neural-net mapping chip that is both "programmable"</i><br>
<i>&gt;and has a much higher training rate than normal neurons seems a reasonable</i><br>
<i>&gt;solution to this problem.  </i><br>

<p>
Ahh, so grow the hand on (say) a pig, with its own nervous system, and then
put in an interface?  Cute idea.
