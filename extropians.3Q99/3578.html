Actually, it ought to be possible to both do the kind of good things I was 
talking about AND make a profit.  For instance, the folks who would build the 
cheap, simple solar-powered sat-net terminals I envision are creating 
billions of new workers, consumers and micro-investors.  In a couple of 
technological generations, it might be possible to make solar-power systems 
that could be bought with Grameen-style micro-loans, so that the people who 
build the systems can get paid for them.

I'm not suggesting that working on low-end bootstrap technologies and 
institutional change is an entirely charitable enterprise, although it is 
philanthorpic: This kind of philanthropy IS profitable, because people are a 
resource.
