<a name="4376qlink1"><a name="4369qlink1">In view of Lee Daniel's pronouncements on the irrationality of feminism, I suppose the following question is in order:  How is feminism irrational?</a></a>

<p>
Looking at feminism in its original form in its inception in the early 1900s, it seems based on a very practical logic. 51% of the population had been cut off of avenues of economic self-sufficiency and cultural resources such as the right to own property, the right to vote.  If one did any work, legally your husband owned it and all of its proceeds.

<p>
<a name="4369qlink2">The logic of feminism in its original form:  The fact that 50% of the population is cut off of economic and cultural resources has no rational basis, but is, rather, based in religious dogmas and cultural superstitions.</a>  

<p>
Granted, feminism has branched off in several directions, and perhaps some of those new paths stray from the basic logic.<a name="4378qlink1">  But why expend so much energy complaining about that, when the vast majority of feminists worldwide are still strongly focused on the original goal?  How much of a threat is Andrea Dworkin to you personally?</a>  Aren't we, as transhumanists, committed to a memetic diversity?
