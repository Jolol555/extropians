<p>
Thanks. Actually, it would have been fun to raise these issues at the
conference. Perhaps next year, if I can find a couple of free days by then....

<p>
Hope the conference is going/has gone well!

&gt;&gt; I recently had another "What's the Hell's up
&gt;&gt; with this 'post-humanism' business?!" discussion
&gt;&gt; with some friends of mine who are academics in
&gt;&gt; the humanities. Many of them are technophobes,
&gt;&gt; or simply unimaginative when it comes to the
&gt;&gt; possibilities of human transformation. But their
&gt;&gt; objections to the term "post-humanism" I share.

</pre>
<p>
<a href="1734.html#1765qlink3">&gt; The usual term, from Foucault and his mates, is</a><br>
<i>&gt; `antihumanism'/`antihumanist'.</i><br>

<p>
Foucault's (and the others') term, unlike "post-humanism," is familiar to
academics in the humanities. As the term is used where I've been, it seems,
however, to denote something else entirely than what post-humanism denotes: an
anti-subject-oriented philosophy; ultimately, an anti-Kantianism (and
-Hegelianism). Thus, in part for the reasons you cite below, Foucault is, first
and foremost, anti-human, in the sense of anti-subject, not anti-humanISM, in
the sense of opposed to Erasmus, Petrarch, etc. (though he is also somewhat
anti-humanism -- misguidedly so, I'd say).

<pre>
&gt;&gt; (It's still not clear to me if the "post-"
&gt;&gt; governs "human," with the "-ism" tacked on to
&gt;&gt; make the substantive, or whether it governs "humanism."

</pre>
<p>
<a href="1734.html#1765qlink4">&gt; The latter, with suspicions among its critics of</a><br>
<i>&gt; a lurking distaste for humans.</i><br>

<p>
(See near end for comment on this.)


<pre>
&gt;&gt; The operative notion of humanism in post-humanism
&gt;&gt; seems to me possibly historically blind; and the
&gt;&gt; notion of the human itself seems to me
&gt;&gt; impoverished and biologically essentialist.

</pre>
<p>
<a href="1734.html#1765qlink5">&gt; The case of the antihumanists is exactly that</a><br>
<i>&gt; humanism as historically constructed is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; essentialism that toadies to power. [...]</i><br>

<p>
As humanism is constructed today, in many respects, yes, the anti-humanist
position seems right. But it's not what humanism originally was. Originally, it
was anti-essentialist, where the essentialism was not of the human, but of the
divine (God -- actually, in many cases, the Catholic Church). The message was:
we humans are capable of managing our own affairs, we are up to the challenge of
sovereignty, _complete_ sovereignty. It was oriented towards the future (though
inspired by the classics): We can transform ourselves completely.

<p>
So, then, post-humanism amounts to pre-contemporary-humanism, that is to say, it
amounts to humanism.

<p>
<a name="1769qlink1">Thus the question about the appropriateness of the term is simply one of
emphasis. Does "humanism" sound wrong to the modern ear? Does it mean</a> too many
<a name="1769qlink2">different things today? If so, "post-" is not the prefix to tack on, but,</a> as I
<a name="1769qlink3">suggested, something like "ultra-" or "neo-" might do the job. If one</a> word could
<a name="1769qlink4">be made out of it, "fearless humanism" would be nice.</a>

<p>
To be sure! But among the academics who have objections to the term, only some
are Luddites.

<p>
And I remain of the belief that "post-humanism" is not accurate, not in the
slightest. Its shock value is a difficult question. Given how many "post-" terms
exist today (in academia as much as anywhere else), "post-humanism" is not very
shocking. A different term, then, might be both more accurate and better able to
shock.


<p>
<a href="1736.html#1765qlink7">&gt; Funny you should bring this up.  A few years ago</a><br>
<i>&gt; in _KaspahRaster_ (<a href="http://www.teleport.com/~jaheriot/kr.htm">http://www.teleport.com/~jaheriot/kr.htm</a>),</i><br>

<i>&gt; "What is posthumanism?" was published there.</i><br>

<p>
I dug around for it, but couldn't find it. Is the essay on the Web somewhere
else? I'd love to read it.

<p>
<a href="1736.html#1765qlink8">&gt; The debate came down to John J. Funk stating</a><br>
<i>&gt; that "posthumanism" is "posthuman--ism" NOT "post--humanism."</i><br>
<i>&gt; Note the difference in stress.</i><br>

<p>
Yes -- so the opposite of (part of) what Damien Broderick says on the parsing of
the term. Hm....

<p>
Thanks to everyone for the thoughts.

<p>
Brian.
