I think I was trying to make the point that "abscence of evidence"

<i>&gt; or technological life), we then can assign #B a greater</i><br>
<i>&gt; probability than #A.</i><br>

<p>
I'll take apart the New Scientist claim, which is basically that
a GRB within ~300 ly, around 4.5 billion years ago "aggregated"
the objects in our solar system, initiating planet formation.
Since we don't have the actual journal article yet, this is difficult.

<p>
Standard stellar models say that only massive stars are going to
be able to turn themselves into the massive objects (neutron stars
or black holes) that can produce GRB.  Where do you get massive
stars?  In massive dust clouds.  Now, the models for the creation
of stars says that in massive dust clouds where you get massive stars
you will also get many smaller stars.  Models for the evolution of
galaxies say that massive dust clouds, massive stars and GRB should
have been more prevalent earlier in the history of the galaxy.
So there are at least 2 holes in the N.S. theory -- (a) the
likelyhood of many Sun-like stars in the vicinity of the GRB
that made our solar system; (b) the fact that there could have
been a time in galactic history when lots of GRB were occuring
and creating lots of solar systems similar to ours.  What we
really need to discuss this further is the frequency at which
GRB occur.

<p>
And that says nothing about how systems without GRB may condense
into planets or other objects that concentrate matter such that
other forms of life might evolve.

<p>
<i>&gt;From the article:</i><br>
<a href="3903.html#3973qlink3">&gt; For over a century, astronomers have tried to understand what made</a><br>
<i>&gt; clumps of dust circling the young Sun melt into chondrules--rocky beads</i><br>
<i>&gt; rich in iron and silicon minerals that make up the bulk of stony meteorites.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3903.html#3973qlink4">&gt; they also think that the dense chondrules settle quickly into the plane</a><br>
<i>&gt; of a protoplanetary disc and speed the formation of planets</i><br>

<p>
They are solving the problem of "why do asteroids" (meteors) have this
funny structure.  They are not saying that solar systems without GRB
*cannot* form planets, just that GRB may speed up planet formation.
For stars with masses slightly smaller than the sun, planet formation
could take an extra billion years and it wouldn't make much difference
because the stars live so much longer.
