Originally, the word meant a Christian who denied the Trinity,
believing in only one Person of the Deity.  The particular form of
Unitarianism that is familiar to Americans began, according to my
trusty Columbia Encyclopedia, in 1785, when King's Chapel in Boston
removed the Trinity from its liturgy.  During the 19th century it
became influential thru the adherence of prominent literary people
such as Ralph Waldo Emerson.

The Unitarians merged with the Universalists in 1961.

My own impression of present-day Unitarianism is that it is for people
who want to have the social &amp; ritual pleasures of churchgoing without
the inconvenience of having to believe anything in particular.

<p>
Also, according to A. N. Whitehead, their creed is that "there is at
most one God".  Groups of bigoted Unitarians are said to burn question
marks on people's lawns.
