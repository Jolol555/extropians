Actually I would argue that the problem you can't controllably release
the energy.  Hydrogen bombs are very dense energy storage devices.  :-)
But if you compare the mass of a tokomak to the mass of the fuel
in it, the device weighs much more than the fuel.

<p>
In the area of storage density, I believe the work at NASA to
create mono-atomic hydrogen frozen in He and use it as a
rocket fuel, could "effectively" be very dense.  But you
are going to need a very interesting "plant" to create
the fuel.  It isn't something you could use to power your
laptop.

I don't believe so.  At some current density, I believe you
setup a magnetic field that disrupts material properties that
allow superconductivity.  I think the highest-field magnets
have a problem with the material simply staying together, so
this problem would presumably apply to superconductors as well
as you keep increasing the field density.

One of the physics gurus may want to comment more.
