<a href="0467.html#0709qlink1">&gt;A Celeron, put quite plainly, is a POS. It has a really pissy small</a><br>
<i>&gt;cache. A dual PII 450 actually is faster than just  a 900 equivalence.</i><br>

<p>
Well, according to a couple of engineering friends of mine who just recently
took an intel assembly language class, running a dual CPU system (by intels
scheme) is only theoretically going to reach something like 1.75 times as
fast, instead of twice.  The actuality of it is even worse, depending on
software.

<p>
But, comparing apples to oranges, can you really explain this difference in
speed just by the cache?
<br>
<a name="0715qlink1">Oh, I was way off in my speed measurement on my celeron, it took about 63
hours for a packet.  Vs. the 8 hours on the dual PII 450.  That's about 8
times faster.  Say that his 450 actually achieved the equivalent of a PII
900 (which it can't), scale down by three, a PII 300 should be about 24
hours.<a name="0739qlink1">  My Celeron 300 is 63 hours, so that makes it equivalent to something
like a PII 115.  Can the small cache really cut my speed down to a third?
