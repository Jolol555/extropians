Agreed.

<p>
Agreed with a footnote.  We have to face the reality of *how* to move
from the existing "statist" solution where the benefits &amp; costs have
complex evolutionary histories, to one where "states" strongly
view their "mission statement" as one of minimal intervention.
Change invokes the threat of survival and while the anarchists
would like to do it tomorrow, I charge that *realistically* that
will not happen (unless we can open a new frontier), so the
requirement, if we are to avoid fantasies, is how to move step-by-step
from the current reality *to* the "ideal" situation.

<p>
My perspective, is that if the environment is depromoting
rational thought the best situation may be to use the weapons
of the environment against itself.  The threat of school competition
might motivate the teachers to rise up against pin-headed school
boards.  This is not a theoretical argument, it *is* a reality based
argument.

<a name="3237qlink3">A key aspect of the discussion, as discussed in the Tough Questions
thread and commented on by Hal in his eloquent comment regarding
parents as "caretakers", is the issue of "freedom of individuals"
and the problem that there are many individuals, who simply refuse
to treat others (especially children) *as* individuals.
