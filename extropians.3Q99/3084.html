Mike,

<p>
Unless you are aware of something I'm not, this is "FUD"
(fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt) spreading.  The panels that I'm
aware of have consistently come down on the side of
"a collection of cells, does not a human being make"
and within reason we should be allowed to develop those
into health treatments.

<p>
I'm unaware of any decision to "refuse genetic engineering in
health care".  In fact I believe the NIH has funded several
groups to develop the vectors that would make gene therapy
much easier in people.

<p>
If Kansas has a "no geneticlly engineered people" law
I would like to hear about it.

<p>
Robert
