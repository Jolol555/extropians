No, because you don't exist in a single moment of time. As I explained
above, but perhaps this helps:

<p>
Your lifespan on timeline AB starts at 0 and goes to 70. high energy
event occurs at time point 20 and creates matter and anti-matter in
equal amounts, which seem to both travel forward in time to point 60.
What really occured was that the anti-matter was created at point 60,
went back in time to point 20, while the matter was created at point 20
and went forward to point 60. We are able to observe the anti-matter the
entire time, from its destruction at point 20 forward(from our own point
of observation)  to point 60 where it was created.
