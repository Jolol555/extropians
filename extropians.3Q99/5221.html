<a name="5225qlink1">Most people who have violence problems are losers too.  So it seems
reasonable to conclude that out of control violence is part of a bigger
problem.</a>

<p>
<a name="5225qlink2">I think that most of us have genes for violence, but those genes are kept
in check by other genes.  The ability to imagine the pain of others and
feel sympathy, is one thing that keeps violent tendencies in check.
Another is fear of the consequences.</a>

<p>
<a name="5225qlink3">So a high tendency for violence coupled with some other deficiencies, is
what adds up to a big violence problem.  So the treatment shouldn't consist
of making violent persons passive.  What we need to do is increase their
mental capibility so that they can control themselves.  And if necessary,
tone down their violent tendencies down into the normal (but not passive)</a>
range.
