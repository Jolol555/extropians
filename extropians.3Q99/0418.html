This is something I've also wondered about for ages.
Maybe there were some intact skeletons found in our
prehistory. The very fact that they *were* found may 
have led to their being destroyed or ferreted away for
one reason or another, hence no "smoking guns".

<p>
Look what happenned to some Mastodon relics.. they 
were (supposedly) fed to dogs! 

<p>
Any early discoveries would have been in "easy"
places, 
<br>
leaving us with harder pickings.

<p>
The ancient Greeks definitely had noted fossil sea
shells in uplands, and theorised various changes
(including catastrophes) to explain them.

<a href="0186.html#0418qlink3">&gt; So, has anyone seen any gargoyles that look</a><br>

<i>&gt; that might add credence to this claim?</i><br>

<p>
Nuts.. everyone knows that Gargoyles were modelled on
the Hunchback of Notre Dame (or maybe Charles
Laughton) :-).
