Oh great!! You can count on me hitting the delete key for each and every one 
of them!! 
<br>
Also, doesn't Greg Burch have a pretty demanding job and a life? A pretty 
good life too, I bet. Would he want a baby sitting job? Mike seems to be 
obsessed with besting this guy (whereas I think most people by now don't 
respond more than once or twice to his opponent, who seems  prone towards 
verbal abuse _ no matter who he is debating with or about what_ after the 
third post) - and it's beginning to appear to me that this thread is a 
compulsion or addiction or something. Eveything is but a repeat, and has been 
for a year. 
<br>
But he is handling himself like a gentleman, at least (I would have dropped 
it years ago and moved on to a new subject and never looked at the other guys 
posts - oh I did... Ba Haha!).
