Could you translate the example of the laser in the sphere(2 light
years....) in a math formula?
<br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I agree that phase speed (which is unobservable directly) can</i><br>

<a href="2599.html#2627qlink8">&gt;&gt; I just got some E mail from John, let's see what it says " Dear John: Be</a><br>

<a href="2599.html#2627qlink9">&gt;&gt; Wow, John is right, that cup is dangerously near the edge, I'll put it in a</a><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; 14,400 Tachyon modem? Well, call me cheap if you want but I still think the</i><br>
