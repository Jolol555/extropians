<p>
Too late.  However he is on vacation until Sep 7, according to his
response program.

<p>
<i>&gt; It would be more prudent to find out from</i><br>
<a href="2482.html#2485qlink2">&gt; Dr. Minsky, whether or not Dr. Dertouzos is nanotech illiterate</a><br>
<i>&gt; or nanotech opposed.  If it the former, he can be educated and</i><br>
<i>&gt; we should be tactful about it.     </i><br>

<p>
Perhaps I should not have concluded, "...please spare us your crotchety
naysaying when faced with a technology that stretches your ossified mind
beyond its limited ability to accept change."  That may not have been
quite as tactful as what Robert had in mind...

<p>
<a href="2482.html#2485qlink3">&gt; The problems are (a) fuel efficiency -- a jetpack can't carry</a><br>
<i>&gt; enough fuel to make them useful with current technologies;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (b) cost -- both jetpacks and air cars are expensive;</i><br>
<i>&gt; (c) safety -- both types of devices would need improvements</i><br>
<i>&gt; to guarantee passenger safety.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; So, I would say that they are (within an order of magnitude)</i><br>
<i>&gt; "equally achievable".  Since an order of magnitude is probably</i><br>
<i>&gt; the difference between the cheapest and most expensive cars</i><br>
<i>&gt; then this may be a reasonable statement.</i><br>

<p>
I think the problem is much more severe for the jetpack, more than
an order of magnitude worse.  A flying car is not that different from
an airplane.  The big problem to solve is the vertical takeoff/landing.

<p>
<a name="2486qlink1">But jetpacks only last 30 seconds.  The fuel is not energetic enough.
And adding more fuel adds weight.  It is questionable whether these can
ever work.
