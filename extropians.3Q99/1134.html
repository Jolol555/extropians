<a href="1116.html#1134qlink1">&gt;   Why did not nature provide a way around this such as a physiological </a><br>
<i>&gt; condition where the pelvis could expand even more then it does presently?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Do you all agree that this is true??  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Apparently (According to some biology documentary I saw recently), the
pelvis has already evolved to it's maximum width able to support walking on
two legs, for exactly the reason you mention. Any wider and the stress of
walking would become too much.
