<p>
I must apologize for my outburst on one of the threads earlier today.  
To have used capital letters and language--well, I can think of no excuse for
that, and I am sorry.  I felt overwhelmed and reacted badly, and hope that my
future contributions to this list reflect my own commitment to nettiquette.

<p>
I also have come to a sad decision this afternoon.  In over a decade on the
Internet, I have held out as one of the staunchest resisters of the use of
bozo
<br>
filtering.  Generalists value input from all sources, and I have always 
retained a faith that people can grow and change and develop.  That faith,
however, has been misplaced in a few instances, and it is time to explore new
methods of processing data.
