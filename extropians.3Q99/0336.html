<a name="0359qlink1">I just finished a novel that may be of interest to subscribers: "Songs From 
the Stars" by Norman Spinrad (who also brought us "Bug Jack Barron,"</a> one of 
<a name="0359qlink2">the few intelligent novels about cryonic suspension around).  "Songs"</a> begins 
<a name="0359qlink3">as a sort of "dubious utopia" novel, but escalates into something</a> bolder and 
<a name="0359qlink4">more cerebral.  It has an overall transhumanist aesthetic and some clever 
riffs on pop culture.</a>

<p>
<a name="0340qlink1">Natasha Vita More mentioned in an unrelated post that she was not, for the 
most part, influenced by science fiction.  As an avid sf reader, I find this 
interesting.  Could you elaborate on your influences?  Sf has always 
functioned as a sort of memetic fountainhead for me; transhumanism</a> came along 
<a name="0340qlink2">as a very happy coincidence...though not entirely as a surprise.</a>
