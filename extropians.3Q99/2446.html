<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>


<p>
Yes, I think I can refute most of them, at least up to a point.

<i>&gt; Weird Coincidences</i><br>
<a href="2391.html#2446qlink2">&gt; ------------------</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; During a full eclipse, the disc of the moon is EXACTLY the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; size as the disc of the Sun.  This means that it PERFECTLY</i><br>
<i>&gt; covers the Sun, no more no less.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What are the odds I ask you, what are the odds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Actually, it's not true that the two disks are exactly the same apparent
size.  The apparent size of the Sun's disk varies from a max of 32.6 arc
minutes on January 1 to a min of 31.6 arc minutes on July 4.  Now there's
a coincidence - the max and min days are New Year's Day and the US
Independence Day, respectively.  But of course any day of the year would
have some significance - Elvis's birthday, for example.  The Moon's
apparent size varies from about 33.4 arc minutes diameter to about 29.4
arc minutes diameter.  There is a slight additional variation (called
augmentation) which is caused by where one stands on the Earth when
observing the Moon, and is calibrated relative to the Moon's altitude
angle.  So total solar eclipses vary in duration depending on how 'big'
the Moon is relative to the Sun, and how 'central' the eclipse is.  Some
solar eclipses are 'annular', meaning the Moon can't quite cover the Sun
at maximum centrality.  Also, the Moon is slowly being pushed away from
the Earth by the Earth's rotation.  It's getting 'smaller' and one day we
will no longer have total solar eclipses (assuming the Sun stays the same
'size').



<p>
<a href="2391.html#2446qlink3">&gt; Our Moon's period of rotation is EXACTLY equal to its period of</a><br>
<i>&gt; revolution around the earth.  This means that its day is equal</i><br>
<i>&gt; to its year, which in turn means that we ALWAYS see the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; face of the moon, and always have.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; To us the moon appears NOT to be spinning at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Again what are the odds, I ask you, what are the odds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If the moon's day was shorter or longer than its year, we would</i><br>
<i>&gt; have long ago discovered that it is spinning because the surface</i><br>
<i>&gt; we saw would change over time, but since relative to us it does</i><br>
<i>&gt; not spin, we could never tell it was a rotating object at all.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Who knows what common man would have known sooner if it had not</i><br>
<i>&gt; been for this incredible coincidence.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>


<p>
It is not surprising at all that the Moon's rotation is locked to its
Earth orbit period.  The Earth's tidal force is strong enough to make
that happen.  The tidal force stretches the Moon out, like pulling taffy,
along the line connecting the Earth and Moon.  The Moon rocks back and
forth (called libration) like a pendulum, just as a free but unbalanced
bicycle wheel rotates back and forth and settles with the most weight at
the bottom.  Most satellites tend to do that, unless they are perfectly
symmetrical.  Over time we see more than 50% of the Moon's surface (about
55%, I think).

<i>&gt; </i><br>


<p>
<a href="2391.html#2446qlink4">&gt; One more that comes to mind:  The Symbol of the 2 ENTWINED</a><br>
<i>&gt; SNAKES has long symbolized MEDINCE or the HEALING ARTS.  Well</i><br>
<i>&gt; two entwined snakes also just happen to look EXACTLY like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; DOUBLE HELIX of a Strand of DNA.</i><br>


<p>
The Caduceus is an old Greek symbol, I think, and its history may provide
a more prosaic reason for it having been chosen.  I don't know enough
about its history to refute the DNA conjecture of its origin, but it
would be reckless to choose such an explanation without looking for the
historical one.  Perhaps it has something to do with the old practice of
treatment by drawing blood, or perhaps it has some reference to poison. 
Look it up and see.



<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2391.html#2446qlink5">&gt; Are all these just COINCIDENCES ???? or does this mean this</a><br>
<i>&gt; knowledge has long existed only to be rediscovered or UNHIDDEN</i><br>
<i>&gt; recently ?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Did the Creator of our Solar System make the moon sun and</i><br>
<i>&gt; earth at the right distances and periods of rotation so that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the above mentioned facts would occur ?  Just because the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Creator could ???  [God or Virtual Reality Designer or</i><br>
<i>&gt; Terra Forming Galactic Civilization???]</i><br>


<p>
I can't prove or disprove those conjectures.



<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2391.html#2446qlink6">&gt; Also did you know that the word MONTH comes from the word MOON,</a><br>



<p>
Yes, and that's not news considering that the month, historically, was
taken to be a lunar phase cycle (called a lunation).  The two words in
English even sound similar.  It's not a coincidence.  Our modern 'months'
in the Gregorian calendar are only loosely based on the lunar month
concept, as the Gregorian calendar we use is a solar calendar, not a
lunar calendar.  The concept of month in the Gregorian calendar was
consciously bastardized to fit the solar (tropical) year.  The Gregorian
calendar was promulgated in 1582 under Pope Gregory, and was a refinement
of the Julian calendar (imposed by Julius Caesar of the Roman Empire). 
The Gregorian calendar was not adopted in England until 1752, nor in
Russia until 1917.  The Julian calendar was in turn a reform of an
earlier Roman calendar.  The historical background of these calendars is
available from standard reference works.



<p>
<a href="2391.html#2446qlink7">&gt; and that a lunar cycle is 28 days long [same as a womans</a><br>
<i>&gt; menstrual cycle and high tides] </i><br>


<p>
High tides on the open ocean (like the middle of the Pacific) normally
occur twice a day, but due to complicated interactions of water masses
with land masses, tides in general follow quite varied schedules.  A
lunar phase cycle is most definitely not exactly 28 days long.  The
lunation varies in duration, but its average duration is 29.503 days. 
The relation to the duration of the typical woman's menstrual cycle to
the duration of the lunar phase cycle may well have an evolutionary
basis; I just don't know.  But the typical woman's menstrual cycle only
roughly matches the duration of the lunation, and does not match the
lunation phase, either from woman to woman, nor for (almost) any woman
over a time of several months or years.



<p>
and that 13 lunar months, or
<br>
<a href="2391.html#2446qlink8">&gt; 13x28days is EXACTLY EQUAL to 364 DAYS AND VERY close to a</a><br>
<i>&gt; year?? </i><br>


<p>
So what?  The solar tropical year is 365.2422 mean solar days in length. 
It has to be _some_ number of mean solar days in length, within its
normal variability.  Since the 'so-called exact' 28 day lunation figure
is wrong anyway, let's use the correct number, 29.503 days, and divide it
into the correct number for the length of the year, 365.2422 days.  We
get 12.379832 months per year.  Not a very round number, eh?  That's why
we have lots of 30 day and 31 day months in the 12 month Gregorian
calendar, even though the lunar month averages only 29.503 days.



<p>
The question then becomes why on earth don't we use
<br>
<a href="2391.html#2446qlink9">&gt; thirteen 28 day months instead 12 weird length months !!!!!!  13</a><br>
<i>&gt; is very close to 12 and 13 equal length months, that are even</i><br>
<i>&gt; delineated by full moons, would be too simple for the commoners</i><br>
<i>&gt; to understand, maybe that is why they hosed with the calender,</i><br>
<i>&gt; who knows !</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Your comments/insights/explanations invited:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; ***********************************</i><br>
<i>&gt; Lloyd Miller,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>


<p>
Thousands of years ago, commoners (and kings) used to count time by days
(solar days), months (lunar months), and years (solar years).  It's quite
natural, and they were quite happy with it.  But those three systems of
time measurement are all somewhat incompatible with one another, in the
sense that they are not related by simple ratios of whole numbers, much
as we might wish they were.  So for crude purposes the old ad hoc system
was fine, since the appropriate method of counting (days, months, or
years) was used depending on the time scale being discussed.


<p>
There are many calendars in current use, and more that were used
historically.  The Muslim calendar, for example, uses strictly lunar
months, the month being reset whenever the new moon is sighted.  So since
the lunar month averages 29.503 days, the Muslim months are either 29 or
30 days, averaging just about 29.5 days, and the Muslim year is 12 months
or 354 days.  The Muslim year is shorter than the solar year, so the
Muslim months slide along relative to the solar seasons.  But that is not
surprising considering that the solar seasons are not very pronounced in
Arabia, where Islam originated.


<p>
The Jewish calendar is solar for years and lunar for months, an
adjustment being made once a year to reconcile the two.  Details are
available from any good encyclopedic reference work.
