<a href="1511.html#1517qlink1">&gt; &gt; For those following the IA vs. AI thread, consider the</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; backlash now escalating against genetic engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (bioenhanced food, cloning).  And this hysterical backlash</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is happening despite the most ethical intentions and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; carefully crafted rhetoric of working biotechnologists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It just occurred to me that I've been engaging in exactly the sort of</i><br>
<i>&gt; qualitative thinking I keep asking people to get away from.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; question is not the degree of backlash against AI, but the degree of</i><br>
<i>&gt; backlash compared against IA.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'll bet that more people go after me with machine guns for being a</i><br>
<i>&gt; (natural!) neurohack than will ever object to my efforts in AI.  After</i><br>
<i>&gt; all, an altered human is there, already existent, easy to see, easy to</i><br>
<i>&gt; conceptualize, easy to fear, and easy to hate.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd love to work on neurohacking but unfortunately I expect enough</i><br>
<i>&gt; public and governmental interference to make the point moot.  Nobody's</i><br>
<i>&gt; going to let me experiment on 11-year-olds, which is where the most good</i><br>
<i>&gt; could be done.  I doubt it'll even be possible to hack around with</i><br>
<i>&gt; adults except on some offshore hospital-boat.  And I certainly can't run</i><br>
<i>&gt; the effort via PGP.</i><br>

There seems to be ongoing concern about the PR associated with transhuman
issues. Perhaps this could be handled well enough that the public might
become positive, or perhaps not.

<p>
Maybe the best way is to remain proactively obscure. Mount a well designed,
well funded (not necessary maybe), continuing campaign to get across to the
public at large that these issues are unimportant, not interesting,
non-threatening, and that the people involved are harmless kooks.

<p>
<a name="1723qlink1">You can always run a two-level campaign; put out the "obscure, harmless,
dull" message to the general public, but try to get a message of
"interesting, non-threatening, potentially incredibly fruitful" message to
academia/corporate world/government funding people(?). To measure success,
you'd be looking for low level but positive support in serious journals &amp;
intelligent media, and no coverage or low levels of "look what the funny
crackpots are up to" stories in the 'danes press.</a>
