Well, as I always say to my clients when they ask whether we can try some 
novel legal theory, "Sure, we can TRY it."  But in this case it won't work.  
The reason is simple: Until someone is successfully revived, cryonically 
preserved people are legally dead.  Period.  Thus, a physician-assisted 
"deanimation" will be considered a physician-assisted suicide; end of 
argument.

<p>
Also, note that while it is true that "some top notch scientific minds view 
cryonics as having a strong possibility of succeeding", the fact is that the 
vast majority of the scientific world considers cryonics to be kooky 
foolishness.  I wouldn't want to risk subjecting the current state of the art 
in cryonics to the judicial rules regarding "junk science".  Rational lawyers 
have fought hard to get those rules in place and it would be a shame to have 
cryonics judged by them prematurely.  When the time is right, I'll be the 
first to support such a move; but this isn't it.
