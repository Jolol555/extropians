Spike points out the fundamental problem with
a conspiracy theory.  You have to guarantee that
nobody will *ever* decide they made a mistake
and talk about it.  You could never guarantee
that with the number of agents that were involved
at Waco.</a>

<p>
I *would* be more inclined to believe that one
or two individuals got a little too much sun one
day and screwed up.  Or that a couple of trigger
happy "cowboys", tired of being away from their
family for months decided to try to "accelerate"
the situation.

<p>
But what that would imply is stress, poor training,
poor command choices, etc. -- *NOT* as has been
suggested that "mass murder was the Govt's intent".

<p>
Of course the situation was organized/planned --
they had been at this for months.  You don't
surround a bunch of armed people who have
presumably violated at least some laws
<br>
without being organized.  You don't lay seige
to such a group without some planning.

<a name="4040qlink1">What possible *motive* would there be for the
</a>
Govt to want to intentionally murder a bunch
<a name="4040qlink2">of its own citizens?  It makes no sense.
