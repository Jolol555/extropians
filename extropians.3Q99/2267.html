<i>&gt;   (b) How old your system is [the oldest systems generally have </i><br>
<i>&gt;       the lowest metal abundances == highest material costs]</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (c) How close you are to the galactic center (a high radiation</i><br>
<i>&gt;       environment); high radiation -&gt; more radiation damage -&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;       more investment in shielding or more energy devoted to</i><br>
<i>&gt;       reconstructing damaged nanoscale structures.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (d) How long you have been "alive" (# billion years) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;       what your accumulated knowledge base is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;   (e) What your position is in the galactic communication net</i><br>
<i>&gt;       (think of the power held by a galactic "router").</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.</i><br>

<p>
These are mainly material comparative advantages. There may also be
"cultural" or "mental" comparative advantages depending on the
physical architecture of the SIs, their software architecture,
personality, skills etc. 

<p>
<a href="2227.html#2267qlink2">&gt; Since, once you have computed your trajectories, safety margins, etc.</a><br>
<i>&gt; you don't have to stay "on", other than for routine maintenance tasks,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the SIs could go into "sleep" mode.  The best thing we could come</i><br>
<i>&gt; up with at the Foresight Group Genius Weekend is that these entities</i><br>
<i>&gt; are generally doing "nothing", but have a "wake me up when something</i><br>
<i>&gt; interesting happens" alarm.  If most of them are asleep, detecting</i><br>
<i>&gt; them is going to be a real nightmare due to the low heat production.</i><br>

<p>
Hmm, I wonder about this. Seems rather pointless to be a supermind and
spend most of the time doing nothing (unless you are really saying
they go into an "introspective" mode and spend their time in Infinite
Fun Space). I think there are many other things to trade, such as
Moravec's suggestion that finding new heuristics for solving useful
but hairy problems like bush-robot hand coordination could form the
basis for a SI economy.
