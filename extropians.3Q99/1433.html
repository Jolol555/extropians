About 2 years ago, somebody wrote a very funny piece
(on sci.astro?) entitled "Downsizing the Solar System"
which detailed Congress's plans to drastically deuce
the numbers of asteroids, planets etc in order to make
space exploration cheaper. Might be worth checking
Deja News.

<p>
As I understand it, the current idea is that Luna is
compositionally similar to the Earth's *mantle* (but
not the core), and this resulted from mantle material
being thrown off by an impact between the proto-Earth
and another (Mars-sized) proto-planet.

<p>
<a href="1408.html#1433qlink3">&gt; and the difficulty of modeling an impact</a><br>
<i>&gt; that could throw off so</i><br>
<i>&gt; much mass, without ejecting it completely from</i><br>
<i>&gt; co-orbit, or having it fall</i><br>
<i>&gt; back.</i><br>

<p>
The impact would provide the energy to throw off the
mass.

Darn! There goes one of my pet theories ;-).
