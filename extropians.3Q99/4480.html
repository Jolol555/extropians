<a name="4491qlink1"><a href="4456.html#4480qlink1">&gt; Can someone explain me why is this list so full with junk e-mail?</a> Is this</a><br>
<i>&gt; intentional by Max to make some money or is it just some bad programming</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the listserver?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4536qlink1">I can only assume that your experience with mailing lists is very
limited, because the ExI lists are in fact more free from this kind
of mail than most.  The fact is, the internet is /full/ of crap
like this, because the world is full of idiots who believe it.  I
personally get about 5-10 such emails a day, only rarely from the
lists here.</a>

<p>
<a name="4491qlink2">As in most security problems in real life, the draconian measures
required to eradicate it completely would also stifle too much
useful discussion.  So most sensible admins take reasonable measures
to cut down on the crap (if they didn't you'd get 10 times as much
as you get now), and learn to live with the rest.  That's one
price of freedom: putting up with some crap you don't like.
