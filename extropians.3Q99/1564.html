Too late.  I mean, I'll seize the chance if I can get it, but:

  <li>  If you want an actual Specialist, a true intelligence enhancement,
you have to start with a kid and ideally an infant.  I was showing signs
as far back as age three, maybe earlier.  I'd be surprised if they could
even help before age 11 or so, and age 15-17 would be the point of
maximum productivity.  That's a ten-year lead time.  If we got started
on it tomorrow they might still not arrive in time for Singularity.

  <li>  Adults have less of a lead time - I would assume just a few months
to get used to it - but aside from "freeing the mind" from the yoke of
evolution, enhancing self-awareness, and bringing abilities under
conscious control, there's not all that much you can do.  That's nothing
to sneeze at - it counts as true transhumanity - but it's not an AI
Specialist either.  Their primary role would be as absolutely
trustworthy leaders and the like; I'd be thinking of them more in terms
of cushions for nanocracy.
