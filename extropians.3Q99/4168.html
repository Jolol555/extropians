glass sliding door, which made it so it couldnt even be used as an
exit, without wrecking the, uh... decor.

Landlord said the guy called one day and said he had moved out
and the key was under the mat.  Never heard from him again, left
the aluminum foil behind and never even asked for his cleaning deposit
back.  The worst part of it was removing all the tabs of double sided
tape.  Fortunately, the landlord knew that trichloroethylene kills the
sticky on most kinds of tape, so it comes away cleanly (free</a> household
cleaning tip).
