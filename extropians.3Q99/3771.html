Is this not symptomatic of the dark age that Carl Sagan saw around us in The
Demon Haunted World?  We have not really matured intellectually as a species
(esteemed members of this list excluded :), we have merely had technology
enhance our ignorance.  After all, there is not much intellectual
distinction between the belief in the existence of  witches on broomsticks,
and  aliens in  UFOs.

 In England the uproar and outrage over GMF has been matched  by an increase
<a name="3785qlink1">in the positive publicity regarding organically grown food, which is
portrayed as natural, healthy etc etc, grown by decent honest folk on small
farms etc etc as it was in the good old days.<a name="4000qlink2"> Science is seen as the enemy
in the form of evil Biotech Industries prepared to sacrifice public health
in the pursuit of profit.
