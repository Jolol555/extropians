<p>
Keep well away?

<p>
I'm not that worried though, since the signature of matter-antimatter
annihilation would be easy to detect across the universe and to my
knowledge no significant sources of such radiation has ever been
observed (the closest thing was some emissions from a core jet of our
own galaxy).

<p>
<a name="2565qlink1"><i>&gt; Since annihilation produces pure energy would that </i><br>

<p>
Definitely much more than a supernova. And much messier - when large
amounts of matter and antimatter react the result isn't pure energy
but a very hot nuclear plasma. This would likely blow away matter and
antimatter, but it could very well be turbulent and contain a mixture
of them. Such an ambiplasma can actually be fairly stable if it is
thin enough, since the collisions between particles are rare enough to
just heat it up. Some physicists (most notably Hannes Alfven) have
suggested this as a mechanism to explain the matter predominance, but
most physicists today go for other explanations.</a> 

<p>
<a href="2375.html#2381qlink3">&gt; On another note.</a><br>
<i>&gt; How can an anti-matter galaxy and a posi-matter(?) galaxy co-exist?</i><br>
<i>&gt; Is this because there is nothing between the galaxies?  All empty space?</i><br>

<p>
Exactly.
