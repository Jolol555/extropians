The best person to ask about his behavior is the person
he belittled in front of everyone at the conference.  That
person was Michael Butler.  Regardless of how long Michael
was taking to ask the question, Minsky's outburst was
completely rude and obnoxious.  And this isn't the first
time I've heard of Minsky publicly treating people this
way.  From my friends working on AI on the east coast, these
sorts of outbursts are par for the course for Minsky.
