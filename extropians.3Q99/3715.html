<a name="3748qlink1">I don't think so.  Remember, Saddam had just initiated an *unprovoked*
attack on a fellow Arab nation after a many-years unprovoked(?) war
</a>
with Iran (perhaps excused because they are less/non-Arab).

<p>
The missle attacks in Israel were designed to prompt the other Arab
nations into supporting his activities Kuwait and starting a full
blown war against Israel.  It didn't work.

<p>
<a name="3721qlink1">If the U.S. hadn't worked *very* hard to restrain Isreal, it could
have come down like this.  Israel is receiving large losses due
to bio/chem toxic weapons, Saddam has therefore violated the Geneva
convention against the use of such weapons.  Israel issues a
warning to cease &amp; desist or suffer the consequences.  Saddam
<a name="3748qlink2">continues.  Israel takes Bagdad out.  I don't think any countries,
including Japan, would raise strong objections in that situation.
</a>
<a name="3721qlink2">Even if they did, so what?  I is extraordinarly unlikely that
the war would have continued at that point.
</a>
</a>

<p>
Of course, if they were being polite about it they might drop
the bomb 50 miles outside Bagdad to see if the population would
wake up.

<p>
Once you have made use of the bomb, you are significantly down
the slippery-slope.  If the other Arab nations had initiated
a non-nuclear response, you simply drop a bomb in front of
the advancing armies to make the point clear.

<p>
<a name="3721qlink3">I doubt the Arabs would consider dropping a bomb (if they
had one) on Jerusalem due to its religious significance, but
on the other hand, Mecca would certainly not be off the list.
I don't see how the Arabs can win playing the game.
