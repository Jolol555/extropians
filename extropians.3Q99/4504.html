<a name="4577qlink1">Scientists make models on the data they get from the universe using their
(enhanced or non-enhanced) senses.  According to our senses, the data comes
from an outside world.  As far as science is concerned, we could all
be living in Matrix-like chambers getting all our sense data from an AI.
Whether the sense data universe ``is'' the ``real'' universe is irrelevant
to science.  Many people believe (religion!) that this holds, however.
Even scientists do that.  That does not make it science, though.
Science tells us what the (sense) university _does_, not what it ``is''.
Philosophies and religions discuss the ``is'' part.

On the confusion of science and technology, one cannot separate research
and development easily today.  Some corporations have research departments
of their own.  Others pay outside researchers to do research for them, using
sponsorships and ``special projects''.

<p>
This might explain the confusion in the popular mind.

<p>
I agree.  The ``should'' stuff belongs to the philopsophies and religions.

Would not that require infinite time and space?
