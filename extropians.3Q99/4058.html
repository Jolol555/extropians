<a name="4062qlink1">haaaaa!  {8^D  This whole notion is going off in the wrong direction.
I could have sharpened the question a little I guess.<a name="4112qlink1">  I do not want
to actually *be* a woman, I just want to understand what it feels like.
I dont want to *be* a homosexual, just want to understand what it

</a>
would people *look* different?  How so?  How could people *not*
look different to you, if you were to switch genders?  No one knows.

<p>
If one were to ask me: spike, what is it like being you?  Or: spike,
what is it like being a hetero male?  I could not answer either question,
because I have never been anything else.  Now, if one were to ask
me what its like being 30something, or what is it like living in California,
those are easy, because I have lived elsewhere and been younger.

Elizabeth, I want to know, for instance, how the heck women can tune
into one channel, then stay there until the whole program is, like, over.
{8^D  Seriously, I want the total *experience* of humanity.  I want
to somehow *know* what its like to be female, lesbian, gay, black,
brown, big, small, fat, schizophrenic, you name it.  I want to be able to
Vulcan mind meld into other people's life experience.  If I could
somehow plug into others' experiences, then I could actually *for the
first time* know what it is like to be me, because I would have something
to compare it to.  I would know what it is like to be not me.

<p>
Perhaps this can only be accomplished after uploading becomes
reality.  Could we not have a hell of a good time with this?  Two
people who love each other could perhaps mentally merge by
writing their collective memories into a location that could be
accessed by either processing unit.  Or perhaps I was thinking too
much about Steve Martin's All Of Me.  [hilarious movie, highly
recommend]

<p>
Furthermore, I have often pondered: what would motivate society
to upload a corpsicle?  Now I know: so it can play in that person's
mindspace.  Their memories are inherently valuable.

<p>
I dont think dressing up as a woman is the approach for me, and
after reading some of Kathryn and Elizabeth's comments on taking
hormones, I have chickened out there too.  I dont think my wife
would be the least bit pleased if I began eating her birth control
pills either...  {8^D
