The more I think about this, I realize there are *plenty* of examples
of this.  Who was that famous Swedish actress, Greta Garbo?  Her
most famous movie line was "I vant to be alone".  Somehow she
got the reputation as being a hermit, when in fact she was no more
privacy oriented than any Hollywood type.  It all came out of
 a movie role!

<p>
Other examples: John Denver.  Made it big with his nature boy
songs, then was more or less forced into the role.  He tried to
shake the Rocky Mountain High image, but no one would buy
it.  Note his music from the 80s, ick.

<p>
Peter Frampton.  Comes alive.  Had to stay that way, to this day.

<p>
Did you think roy Orbison was blind?  He wasnt.  He sat on
his thick glasses right before a concert, so he put on his dark
perscription sunglasses, people thought he was blind, then he
was stuck with that forever.  It sold records.

<p>
Madonna.  She isnt really the material girl.  Doesnt really have
hundreds of lovers.  Sold records.

<p>
Stevie Nicks was never a *real* witch.  It sold records.

<p>
Rush Limbaugh is an *entertainer*.  Listen and laugh.  I dont
see why not.  Most comics are liberals, so why cant the
other side have some fun too?  spike
