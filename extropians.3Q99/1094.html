<p>
If you mean that the sorts of civilizations you describe would be the 
_easiest_ to spot, due to their expansive growth, etc., then I agree with 
you.  My argument wasn't that we shouldn't be keeping our eyes out for such 
civilizations, merely that I think limiting ourselves to nanotech 
civilizations is just that--limiting.

<p>
<a href="1070.html#1094qlink4">&gt;A civilisation below nanotechnology level is essentially</a><br>
<i>&gt;incapable of interstellar travel. </i><br>

<p>
Nanotech would be extremely useful for an intstellar mission.  But 
_"essential"_?  Agreeing whole-heartedly with your statement "Evolution is
nonlinear, yet coevolutionary factors favour intelligence emergence," I think 
it's a contradiction to expect every single exploratory civilization to fit 
the paradigm you propose.

<p>
<a href="1070.html#1094qlink5">&gt;I don't consider &gt;10^4 year journeys</a><br>

<p>
If you can get to one star to another, it's an instellar voyage, regardless 
of what technology was used to get there.

<p>

<p>
<a href="1070.html#1094qlink7">&gt;It's not fancy, it's simply economical.</a><br>

<p>
Certainly.  But I'm not willing to make the _huge_ leap that every single 
interstellar civilization will rely on nanotech.  "Variance" may well prove 
to be the key word, when the history of the galaxy is written.

<p>
<a href="1070.html#1094qlink8">&gt;1) We cannot build stellar ramjets yet 2) anything we send out today</a><br>
<i>&gt;will be very quickly overtaken by next-generation craft, because we're</i><br>
<i>&gt;well underway to turn into a supertechnology civilisation.</i><br>

<p>
Yeah, they would be overtaken.  But what if the reason they left their home 
system was due to a cataclysm (or political/sociological stagnation) that 
stopped the technological advance that would have made nanotech a practical 
reality?  What is an alien culture had some strange taboo against using 
nanotech for certain functions (i.e. spaceflight)?  Et cetera.  I think your 
argument suffers from a premature allegiance to the interstellar diaspora 
scenario.  

<p>
I'm not arguing that your ideas are faulty, and I agree that we are becoming 
a suertechnology civilization (and _will_ become one--barring accidents).  
What I argue is the _inevitablity_ of this scenario, which is one of so many 
the list could fill volumes.
