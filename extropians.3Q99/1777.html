<p>
Yes, but that's where it gets interesting.  Because its my software that can make a
decision to utilize the increasing means available to reprogram my hardware.  Simple
hardware changes now available include dietary intake, supplements, nootropics and
psychotropics.  And as we all know these are only a prelude of what is to come.

<p>
Yes.  I agree that what most people call their free will is at least ~99.9%
pre-programmed.  It's that remaining ~0.1% that needs to be addressed.

<p>
To better illustrate what I'm saying, consider another paradox between conscious
decisions and a deterministic universe.  Our conscious thoughts are a product of our
neural architecture which is governed by the properties of cellular biochemistry,
which is governed by atomic and quantum physical processes.  Technology continues to
increase our capacity in manipulating these processes to our own end.<a name="1792qlink1">  So another way
of looking at nanotechnology is as a complex set of atoms (us) manipulating
themselves for their own end in a *bootstrapping* process.  So the question is, what
or who is doing the manipulating?  Subquantum processes?  Sub-sub-quantum processes?
And what happens when we can manipulate those as well? Until this question can be
answered, the verdict on still out on free will.</a>
