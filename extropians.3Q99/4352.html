<a name="4372qlink1"><a name="4371qlink1">I referred in my paper to:
<p>
    Jun Jugaku and Shiro Nishimura. A search for dyson spheres around
    late-type stars in the solar neighborhood ii.  pp. 707-710 in Cristiano B.
    Cosmovici, Stuart Bowyer, and Dan Werthimer, editors. Astronomical
    and Biochemical Origins and the Search for Life in the Universe,
    number 161. Editrice Compositori, 1997.

The 1% isn't an assumption, but rather a measured bound on starlight
reradiated at IR temps at these stars.

<a href="4085.html#4352qlink2">&gt;So then the questions become what is the power the</a><br>
<i>&gt;star is emitting and how much material do they have?  Smaller</i><br>
<i>&gt;stars or more material make the power dissipation per m^2 by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;outermost layers lower and therefore the temperature as well.</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; From a theoretical standpoint (if you live long enough and grow</i><br>
<i>&gt;big enough *or* do stellar mining to reduce the power output</i><br>
<i>&gt;of your star *or* build the MBrain around a Gas Giant and use</i><br>
<i>&gt;it to fuel thermonuclear reactors) you can make your radiation</i><br>
<i>&gt;temperature *very* close to that of the background radiation</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the universe (2.7K).  This is the most efficient situation from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;thermodynamic viewpoint, and therefore a goal advanced civilizations</i><br>
<i>&gt;would presumably strive for.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4371qlink2">Are you suggesting that aliens may in fact be intercepting more than 1%
of the starlight from these 100 nearby stars that Jugaku observed,
but are reradiating it at near 3K?  Or are you suggesting that there
</a>
<a name="4371qlink3">are at least hundreds of other stars that have been completely enclosed
</a>
<a name="4371qlink4">and are reradiating at near 3K?   Under either of these scenarios you
have to ask: why these aliens are leaving all these stars to throw their
valuable hot photons off to infinity?
</a>

<p>
<a name="4371qlink5">It would be very far from efficient to carefully manage the less than 1%
of light you did intercept while completely ignoring the 99% you let go by.
</a>
<a name="4371qlink6">And it would be far from efficient to so patiently manage one star while
completely ignoring others nearby.
