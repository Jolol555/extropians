The author is the director of MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science. I was
really struck with how absolutely feeble the arguments were.</a>

I post it solely as a cultural bellwether.

Another cultural bellwether:

Showtime has been running a one-hour documentary about historical visions of
the future.  Most of the people interviewed were actors and other
entertainers, so I think it's safe to assume that their opinions are
probably fairly typical of people at large.  The two things that really
struck me:


<OL>
<a name="2494qlink1">  <li>  They were all rather disappointed and even annoyed that there wasn't
more technological progress by now.</a>  They wanted grand, visible signs of
progress, and were clearly in favor of it.  I didn't watch the whole thing,
but in the part I did watch, no one commented on all the amazing things that
have happened that were never predicted.

<a name="2482qlink2">  <li>  They had no idea what was a potentially realistic prediction and what
was an absolutely fanciful one.  For example, there was a little segment on
flying cars, and another segment on jetpacks that would allow you to fly.
It appeared that everyone interviewed saw these as equally achievable
technologies.
