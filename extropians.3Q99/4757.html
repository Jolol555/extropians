From: "Robert J. Bradbury" &lt;bradbury@www.aeiveos.com&gt;

 
<p>
<a href="4738.html#4757qlink1">&gt;&gt; There is a third link, the Internet itself, which in a tragedy</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of the commons situation lacks sufficient bandwidth.</i><br>
 
<p>
<i>&gt;This is a good point, but in my experience on the net (since</i><br>
<i>&gt;its inception pretty much), the situation got much better once</i><br>
<i>&gt;we had high capacity (fiber) intercity lines carrying much of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the traffic.   When everyone jumped on the bandwagon (1995+)</i><br>
<i>&gt;things got bottlenecked for a while, but people seem to have</i><br>
<i>&gt;adjusted now to the "continual growth" model and have plans</i><br>
<i>&gt;in place for increasing the capacity as requried.</i><br>

<p>
Yes things are better, those of us in the trenches build new
routers, new ATM facilities, and new SONET bays everyday, and we
work alot of overtime..... ;)

<p>
I just finished the link between Ameritech and our soon to be new
bosses SBC.


<p>
<a href="4738.html#4757qlink2">&gt;&gt; We use WDM now, there isn't sufficient fiber in ground, or</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; equipment installed, to begin to handle the bandwidth everyones</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; talking about, and the BIG point is that it's currently to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; expensive to install.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;Well, it depends who is "talking".  I think there is a *lot*</i><br>
<i>&gt;of marketing hype about everyone wanting T1 speeds.  If I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can do a net-meeting or family conf. call on an ADSL line</i><br>
<i>&gt;then that is fine for my requirements.  I've got a satellite</i><br>
<i>&gt;dish that gets 500+ channels and I don't use it.  At one</i><br>
<i>&gt;point I thought I would use it for downstream datacomm but</i><br>
<i>&gt;that was before ADSL came along.  I believe in general</i><br>
<i>&gt;surveys show a gradual migration from TV watching to</i><br>
<i>&gt;net surfing.  E-mail messages (low bandwidth) are replacing</i><br>
<i>&gt;telephone calls (high bandwidth);  [Scientific American, pg 112,</i><br>
<i>&gt;October 1999].</i><br>

<p>
You know your stuff, last year was the first time data traffic
exceded telephone traffic on our networks.


<p>
<i>&gt;Humans are bandwidth limited, I can't watch 500 channels, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;can only watch 1 and the compression techniques keep putting</i><br>
<i>&gt;that channel into smaller bandwidth requirements (MPEG3-&gt;MPEG4).</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, I think the bandwidth problem is overemphasized.  However,</i><br>
<i>&gt;I agree with the "tragedy of the commons" problem, and that seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;to require a software/hardware solution so all message are not</i><br>
<i>&gt;treated as being equal.  I'm not sure however that it requires</i><br>
<i>&gt;going so far as to price all content.  The people who really</i><br>
<i>&gt;require the dedicated bandwidth always have the option of buying</i><br>
<i>&gt;it.</i><br>


<p>
Once again your right on, if e-mail was all we needed we're all
set, the problem is people who want to run studio digital video
(45MBS) to their friends.....

<p>
Oh, and the Internet telephone people........ (ip telephony... on
ethernet?) TANSTAAFL.
 
<p>
<a href="4738.html#4757qlink3">&gt;&gt; All optical is the way to go, unfortunately no ones willing to</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; build it. (too expensive).</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;It looks like fiber to multiplexed low-power GHz radio on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;telephone poles may get us there.</i><br>

<p>
George Gilder did a piece a few years ago on digital radios, very
cool. The only problem with the GHZ radios is getting a standard (
the nice thing about standards? there's so many to choose from...
;) ) and the cost of infrastructure installation (I'm easy but I'm
not cheap)


<p>
<a href="4738.html#4757qlink4">&gt;&gt; Don't confuse pinging trace-routes with bandwidth availability,</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;try running traffic at say T-1 speed 1.536 MBS (framed) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;you'll see what I mean...</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;For my uses, and most users, I suspect, ping/traceroutes *do*</i><br>
<i>&gt;tell you where the bottlenecks are, and they *aren't* in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;backbones. </i><br>

<p>
You are definitely in the upper 1% of users

<p>
When I started on the Internet the link to Japan had just been
installed.... 9.6K a few months later 56K.


<p>
<i>&gt; I would say that this is because the telecommunications</i><br>
<i>&gt;professionals (Ameritech, MCI, Sprint, etc.) *have* figured out</i><br>
<i>&gt;how to manage their bandwidth growth requirements, while the</i><br>
<i>&gt;suppliers and end-users (the non-professionals) for the most part</i><br>
<i>&gt;have not.</i><br>

<p>
I have the calluses to prove it....


<p>
<i>&gt;Almost all of the stuff I do on internet is browsing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't need T-1 speeds -- humans cannot drink at those speeds</i><br>
<i>&gt;(going back to the tidal wave analogy).  The only people who</i><br>
<i>&gt;*think* I need those speeds are the people who want to stream me</i><br>
<i>&gt;video (but I've got a satellite for that!) or who want to throw me</i><br>
<i>&gt;a megabyte of Java code in 1/10th of a second that makes my</i><br>
<i>&gt;computer bark like a dog.</i><br>

<p>
Thats why I think ADSL switches are the next step till we go 100%
fiber. If you can establish point to point connections, you don't
need pentabyte/exabyte backbones.....


<p>
<a href="4738.html#4757qlink5">&gt;&gt; I can't agree, the inter NAP trunks often run at 100% bandwidth,</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and everything slows down. There just isn't anywhere near the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; backbone to support millions of connections running at ADSL</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; bandwidth.</i><br>


<p>
<i>&gt;It depends on whether that bandwidth is continually utilized.</i><br>
<i>&gt;I probably use 0.0001% of my ADSL total bandwidth.  I think that</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be true for most users (going back to the basic limits we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have on processing information).  What I want is fast page load</i><br>
<i>&gt;times (the average page takes me much longer to process than</i><br>
<i>&gt;it does to load).  I was actually pretty stunned when I tried</i><br>
<i>&gt;Netscape's new Gecko browser recently.  The page load times</i><br>
<i>&gt;improved quite dramatically.  Though it isn't ready for prime</i><br>
<i>&gt;time (it took me about 5 minutes to crash it), it does point</i><br>
<i>&gt;out how better software engineering can significantly improve</i><br>
<i>&gt;the perception of how slow the net is.</i><br>

<p>
Good points again, the problem is we have to build networks that
can take maximum load even if it's only once a year (Mothers day!)
We hear about it if anybody's connection is even slightly slow....

<p>
Hell, we get thousands of calls that they can't connect at 56K
despite the fact the telephone system isn't even tariffed for data
, much less than at that rate...

<p>
<i>&gt;While the trunks may be heavily loaded, it seems that the growth</i><br>
<i>&gt;is well managed at this point.  Better engineering of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;upstream and downstream ends is where the emphasis really</i><br>
<i>&gt;needs to be.</i><br>

<p>
 I agree, Bandwidth costs $$$.
