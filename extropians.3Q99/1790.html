<a name="1810qlink1">Hello everyone,

<p>
I wish I had been to Extro 4 but could not make it.  And so I was thrilled 
<a name="1799qlink1">to hear Spike Jones say that he was going to convert his collection of taped 
lectures into text for those who could not attend.</a>  I just hope that all of 
you with taped lectures will help in this so those who did not attend will 
get to know what they missed.
</a>

<p>
I also hope that those of you that took photographs will post them on your 
homepages so we can get a better idea of what happened.  At the standard 
gaming and fantasy cons that is standard practice.<a name="1799qlink2">  Of course I doubt there 
were any people costumed as Klingons or Vulcans there!</a>

<p>
Was there any planning sessions in terms<a name="1799qlink3"> of advancing cryonics forward in 
</a>
terms of advertising or fund-raising?  Did the meeting spoken of on the 
digest ever take place?

<p>
Please share with the non-attendees on the extropians digest what your 
impressions were of the Extro and what was the most educational and the most 
fun.  Please give us a feel for it!

<p>
Sincerely planning to attend next year no matter what,

<p>
John Grigg

<p>
<a name="1810qlink2">P.S.  Max and Natasha please make those extropian cable shows available to 
all of us in one format or another!!  I realize you are very busy people but 
we would all appreciate it so much.</a>
