<i>&gt;our local vicinity.  [They may be observing, but they aren't</i><br>
<a name="0567qlink1"><i>&gt;interfering [regligious miracles &amp; alien abductions excepted].</i><br>

<p>
"Excepted" in the sense that "they're of no consequence and not worth looking 
at" or excepted in the sense that "these are some examples that may well be 
evidence of interference but I'm not going to launch into detail about them"?
</a>

<p>
<a href="0540.html#0541qlink2">&gt;The evidence as I read it, best says, once evolved, a "stand-off-ish"</a><br>
<i>&gt;position is adopted that allows them to inexpensively observe</i><br>
<i>&gt;further evolution. </i><br>

<p>
<a name="0567qlink2">Why "hands-off"?</a>  I can certainly see many reasons for this approach, but at 
the same time<a name="0567qlink3"> I'm forced to wonder if an arbitrarily advanced civilization 
wouldn't have a plethora of artificially evolved civilizations at its 
</a>
disposal.<a name="0567qlink4">  Perhaps the "supreme" civilization uses some as controls and some 
as test subjects.  My money is on us being the victims of some cosmic test, 
but that's neither here nor there.</a>

<p>
<a name="0567qlink5">Also, why "inexpensively"?  I understand the concept of available resources, 
etc., but the notion of "expense" has an anthopomorphic ring to it I'm not 
sure I like--especially if the hypothetical civilization we're dealing with 
is arbitrarily advanced, as postulated above (i.e. has molecular 
</a>nanotechnology).<a name="0567qlink6">  "Expense" was Carl Sagan and Frank Drake's big argument for 
the feasibility of SETI, but their reasoning was (arguably) based more on 
depicting alien motives in popularly understandable terms than dealing with 
really _alien_ aliens.</a>  

<p>
<a name="0553qlink1">I'm not bashing SETI; far from it.  But the "SEMANTICS" light on my monitor 
starts blinking when I read words that seem to insinuate an earthly monetary 
system on a nonterrestrial civilization.</a>
