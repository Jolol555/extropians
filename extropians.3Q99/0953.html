Im betting on caloric restriction, but I do not necessarily
recommend it, especially if you are currently young (&lt;30).
In order to pull it off you really need to be at least a
little obsessive compulsive (like me).  The reason I go to
such extremes is that I figure I am right about on the edge:
that is, if I can make it until about 80, (a little over 40 yrs
from now) then nanotech should kick in just in time to help
me live until... who knows.  But I dont suspect nanotech
will be ready much before then.  And Eliezer's singularity
could spoil the whole thing, but maybe not.

<p>
Speaking of which, someone please forward this to
Eliezer, since Im in his kill file:

Arent you a little curious to see how far we humans could
go without *that* coming along and doing...who knows what?
Maybe the new software really wont be interested in keeping
us carbon units around.  I *like* us.  spike
