<a name="2232qlink2">	This seems like a completely worthless definition of free will
</a>
to me.  I can achieve this by taking no ration thought about a choice
and simply flipping a coin for every decision, but is that what I
really want?  Of course not.  If the choice is between something of
different value (as deduced by accurate, rational thought) - between
eternal life or eternal death lets say.  I obviously, unconditionally,
and deterministically always want the choice that has more value.
Anything that causes me to choose otherwise, whether it be randomness
in the decision process, quantum cosmology, or whatever, destroys my
ability to get what I really want and hence eliminates my ability to
fulfill my true will.

<a href="2148.html#2221qlink3">&gt; Why do we need that? If the agent does what it does because of cause</a><br>

<p>
	Good point.  And even if the cause of our choices was
something other than randomness or mechanical/rational determinism
(something other than these seems logically impossible to me), if it
ever results in, or causes (or forces?) us to choose that which is of
lessor value, it destroys our ability to get what we really want and
hence makes us not free in my mind.

<p>
	As you can see, I'm a compatibilest.  I think free will is
compatible with determinism.  The only way we can truly be free is if
things are reliably deterministic so we can reliably and
unconditionally always make the best (i.e. the most free) choice.
Anything that causes us to deviate from that which is of most value,
destroys our freedom.  (And if the choice is between two things of
equal value, who cares which choice we make?  Such shouldn't concern
us like a choice between two choices of different value should.)
