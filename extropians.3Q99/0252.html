I can't speak for anyone else, but the problem I have with this kind of
intervention in the stock market is that it encourages all kinds of bizarre
and inefficient investments.

<p>
No, the alternative is to get the government out of the market and let people
make up their own minds as to value.

<p>
And why should "adequate" dissemination be important? Why should people who
are trying to work out whether to invest in a particular company be prevented
from discussing the true nature of the company until information is 
"adequately" disseminated? If someone was thinking of investing in a company
that another person worked for, and if that company was going down but the
company hadn't yet admitted this fact, why should the employee not be able
to warn the potential investor? Why should the investor lose all their money
just because the government wanted to be sure the information about the
company's impending collapse was "adequately" disseminated before employees
were able to talk about it? Why shouldn't active, involved investors be able
to get accurate information about the companies they invest in? Preventing
this flow of information merely turns the market into a lottery.

<p>

<p>
Uh, so why are you supporting insider trading laws?
