Yes, I meant "relatively autonomous, when compared with current dependence.

<p>
The chances of one small group taking over the entire world in a
military coup are pretty small at the moment.  Since it is an ancient
fear, people are quite alert to watch for and squelch any movement in this
direction.  Local singularity scenarios are different in that they are
technology driven, whereby a sudden and huge tech advance allows gives
incredible power to one small group.  The claim is that few are watchful
to or able to squelch such an advance.

<a name="4338qlink1">The fear is usually more of a small lab or county taking over, instead

but others on this list most clearly do.</a>

Yes, that is my intuition.  But the question I was facing was why
others have such dramatically different intuitions.</a>
