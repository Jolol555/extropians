Hi, everyone

<p>
I should think that with sufficiently *advanced* nanotech (not even to 
mention the possibilities of hyperspace tech [a la Saul-Paul Sirag] and 
pico- and femto-tech [as briefly mentioned in Kurzweil's *Age of Spiritual 
Machines*]) many "jobs," "activities," "chores," etc. will likely be 
**either** (more-or-less completely) OBVIATED **or** thoroughly 
NANO-cybernated, thus obviating macro-level (i.e., conventionally conceived) 
<br>
"robots."  Now, of course, a "Robby the Robot" type of robot (or something <br>
generally similar) may indeed find uses in various environments/contexts, as 
might a Moravecian "bush robot"; but, for the most part, I should think that 
such things will be obviated, precisely at the nano-organizational level.

<p>
On the OTHER hand---and here's wHere it gets axiologically/normatively 
interesting---there shall surely be intelligent "artifactual" (yet, of 
course, oftentimes quasi-organismic) **systems** (whose macro-level 
manifestations might well be thought of as ontological **gestalts**, i.e., 
<br>
"entities," or even [sometimes] "robots").  And, indeed, these systems, <br>
robots, what-have-you, well be not only intelligent, but ULTRA-intelligent.  
WIll they qualify as *persons* (a la Strawson, David L. Norton, et al)?  
Tough question.  My intuition is PROBABLY!!<a name="0411qlink2">  And don't forget that "we" 
shall soon-on be able to *merge* with entities/systems such as these.  What 
</a>
of personal identity??  Well I burned-out (mea culpa!) before completing my 
Ph.D.s in both economics (NYU)  and philosophy (SUNY-Buffalo) (although I 
got my J.D., thank goodness) so I'll defer to our resident Ph.D. on such 
matters, Max (More, that is).  You did you dissertation on this stuff (more 
or less) didn't you Max?

<p>
<a name="0423qlink1">And as for the whole *ethical/legal* "status" of ultra-</a>intelligent systems, 
<a name="0423qlink2">this is surely a conceptual *frontier* where we'll have to evolve it as we 
go along (kinda like common law).<a name="0479qlink1">  My intuition though, goes for a kind of 
modified combination of "Asimov's Laws of Robotics" plus something closely 
resembling a robust set of liberal/civil libertarian protocols for humans 
vis-a-vis such systems.</a> (BTW, didn't Asimov also promulgate something 
parallel with [and conjoined with] the Robotic "laws" specifically 
</a>
enumerating such *human* protocols??---someone help me [us] on this 
reference!)

<p>
And if some of this missive is already passe, redundant, not-courant, then 
**please forgive me**--I'm playing "catch-up" again and still have tons of 
Extro e-mail to sift through.  Just my 2 cents!

<p>
Best regards to ALL!    TOWARD META-COSMIC HORIZONS!

<p>
P.S.  BTW, I've seen Dave Deutch's (excellent and highly recommended, BTW) 
book *Fabric of Reality* mentioned in passing a few tines lately, but what 
about Dave Darling's equally great (though somewhat different) book, 
*Equations of Eternity*?  Darling is also a mathemetical physicist and much 
of *Equations...* dovetails with Deutch's *Fabric...* (although I should 
mention that whereas Deutch comes out for his own modified multiple-worlds 
interpreation of quantum cosmology, Darling, as best I can make out, pops 
for a modified Wheeler-Bohm (hidden variable???!) 
self-activating-becoming-yet-sorta-kinda-all-really-happening-"at-once"-Universe 
[yeah, yeah, I know, I'm not completely sure what the hell that means just 
now either!])  Darling's stuff is very good, however, and I wonder what the 
rest of you guys and gals think!?

<p>
Hope y'all have a great weekend!
