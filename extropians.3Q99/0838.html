<a href="0832.html#0838qlink1">&gt; I remember reading about Melatonin - is it useful in this context? Are there</a><br>
<i>&gt;  other drugs/supplements which can help with a freaky sleep cycle?</i><br>

<p>
I started using melatonin when I was traveling overseas frequently and found 
that it worked very well to adjust my diurnal cycle quickly and with no 
noticeable side-effects.  About 2 years ago, after reading about how the 
body's natural melatonin production begins to decline from about age 30 on 
and its important anti-oxidant functions, I began taking melatonin regularly 
here at home, 3 mg one-half hour before bedtime.  My sleep has certainly 
improved and I've had no adverse side-effects (and I get regular, in-depth 
medical exams).

<p>
I don't know what sort of effects there might be from using melatonin on a 
regular basis to shift one's diurnal cycle back and forth, but don't believe 
experimenting with it for a while would be harmful.
