<p>
&gt;&gt; ... Hopefully you've forgotten the whole
&gt;&gt; encounter, and don't even know who I am!)

<p>
&gt; Oh, absolutely. [....]<br>

<p>
<a name="3521qlink1"><a name="3520qlink1">Excellent! (I want to have a personal electro-shock device so</a> that I can zap
away memories of insulting/obnoxious things I say. It "wasn't me....")</a>


<pre>
&gt;&gt; Having a philosophy in place before the Big
&gt;&gt; Change occurs might be an incredibly good thing
&gt;&gt; -- life-saving, even earth-saving, perhaps.

</pre>
<p>
<a href="3464.html#3488qlink1">&gt; Yep, to be saved, I think we need a philosophy</a><br>
<i>&gt; that effectively allows us to transcend a</i><br>
<i>&gt; massive body of gentic &amp; cultural programming.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Not a small task.</i><br>

<p>
[....]

<pre>
&gt;&gt; One thing I am fairly certain of, though:
&gt;&gt; Virtually ALL philosophies, as well as religions,
&gt;&gt; are concerned with the purpose of life.

</pre>
<p>
<a href="3464.html#3488qlink2">&gt; Yes, it seems to be a common thread.  Is there</a><br>
<i>&gt; any philosophy though that says "there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; purpose", or "the purpose is to have fun" or</i><br>
<i>&gt; something that begins to deal with a motivational/operational</i><br>
<i>&gt; paradigm when survival is no longer an issue?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3512qlink1">There are definitely some schools of thought that make such claims, but,</a> in my
<a name="3512qlink2">view they fail.<a name="3491qlink1"> How, after all, would one ground the notion that "the purpose is
</a>
<a name="3512qlink3">to have fun"? Not that, personally I believe such a view has zero merit.</a> I just
<a name="3512qlink4">think it can't (easily, at least) be justified.</a></a>


<p>
&gt;&gt; &gt; re: SIs assembly &amp; disassembly once
&gt;&gt; &gt; existance was shown to be pointless

<pre>
&gt;&gt; Yup. Though maybe also: just stay the way you are,
&gt;&gt; and continue to try to verify -- forever -- that
&gt;&gt; your realization that there's no good philosophy
&gt;&gt; is accurate.

</pre>
<p>
<a href="3464.html#3488qlink3">&gt; Well, now you get into the realm of mathematical</a><br>
<i>&gt; proofs where they can't "really" prove it, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; they run enough computer programs and I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; they get to the point where they can show that</i><br>
<i>&gt; statistically it must be true.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3512qlink5">For me, this is a question, not a certainty about method: is it, indeed,</a> that
<a name="3512qlink6">one gets into the realm of mathematical proofs here? Or is it that one</a> gets into
<a name="3512qlink7">the realm of whether mathematical proofs are the right way to answer these
questions?<a name="3491qlink2"> The former is Russell (more or less), the latter is Wittgenstein.
</a>
<a name="3512qlink8">Wittgenstein, in my view, was closer to being on the right track.</a></a>


<p>
<a href="3464.html#3488qlink4">&gt; If I've thought about a philosopy for a billion</a><br>
<i>&gt; years or so and haven't come up with one.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't think there is much point for thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt; another 10 billion years about it.  But thats</i><br>
<i>&gt; just my opinion.</i><br>

<p>
Not "just": you may well be right. There may come a point where one says: it
simply isn't going to work.

<p>
&gt;&gt;&gt; This seems to fit the  paradox of "Why do we
&gt;&gt;&gt; still see stars?".

<pre>
&gt;&gt; Even under the (in my view, incorrect)
&gt;&gt; assumption of philosophical materialism, it
&gt;&gt; seems highly likely that there are energy
&gt;&gt; sources the use of which wouldn't have any
&gt;&gt; manifestation that we normo-humans could know
&gt;&gt; about.

</pre>
<p>
<a name="3491qlink3"><a href="3464.html#3488qlink5">&gt; If you are talking about something that would</a><br>
<i>&gt; violate the laws of entropy I would have to</i><br>
</a><i>&gt; disagree. </i><br>

<p>
Why?


<p>
&gt;&gt; &gt;  (b) SIs evolve to the point of:
<br>
&gt;&gt; &gt;        benevolence|caretaking|indifference|quiescence.

<pre>
&gt;&gt; I'd add:
&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;  (e) SIs are still evolving, we just don't see them.

</pre>
<p>
<a href="3464.html#3488qlink6">&gt; This seems to be a variant of (b).  I didn't</a><br>
<i>&gt; mean to imply that they are not still evolving.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Though I would argue they rapidly get close to</i><br>
<i>&gt; the limits physics allows, so the evolution</i><br>
<i>&gt; would primarily occur on non-physical levels).</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3491qlink4">I see. That makes sense, though the description should include something other
than "quiescence"-like</a> terms

<p>
&gt;&gt;
<br>
&gt;&gt; Do ants _see_ us?

<p>
<a href="3464.html#3488qlink7">&gt; I suspect so, but I'm sure the sensory</a><br>
<i>&gt; impression is rather "funny", perhaps similar to</i><br>
<i>&gt; our impression of a mountain when we are</i><br>
<i>&gt; climbing it.</i><br>

<p>
Maybe. But it might be a much more radical "funniness": It's not us at all that
they see. It's not BEINGS that they see. They're trying to get from the stove to
the sink, and "something just goes wrong" [our standpoint: we squash them].

<p>
An exceptionally difficult matter.

<p>
<a href="3464.html#3488qlink8">&gt; We can obviously detect things *much* larger</a><br>
<i>&gt; than us (stars, galaxies, etc.).  We also seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; to understand *what* those things are.  It can</i><br>
<i>&gt; be shown that the ET could be here in large</i><br>
<i>&gt; numbers and we don't see them (because they</i><br>
<i>&gt; operate at the nano-level).  Since we don't (mostly)</i><br>
<i>&gt; have the tools to detect them, our only option</i><br>
<i>&gt; in working on this problem is to look at things</i><br>
<i>&gt; we cannot easily explain or that cannot be seen</i><br>
<i>&gt; that we stronly suspect are there.</i><br>

<p>
Empirically, yes, this is our only option.<a name="3491qlink5"> But in deciding whether or not aliens
<a name="3512qlink9">might pervade our world, we can entertain other options.</a></a>

<p>
