Anders I seem to recall a [possibly mistaken] meme that there was an
explosion of interest in long term technological projects, extropian
thought of the day, etc, right after the dawn of this millenium.  There
was a general notion that time was coming to an end, but after
the odometer rolled over, people realized no, this old world is here
to stay for a while.  Were not the massive cathedrals of Europe
started in the 11th century?</a>

...No problem, I usually get rid of colds quickly (vitamin c, lots of
sleep and too little time to waste by being inefficient)...

Now waaaaait a minute Anders.  Linus Pauling claimed that
vitamin c helped rid one of colds, but I understood that the
research was never replicated under controlled conditions,
so the whole notion was dismissed.  Am I mistaken?  spike
