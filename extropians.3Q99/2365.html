Astronomers Baffled by Space Light

<p>
By MATTHEW FORDAHL AP Science Writer 

<p>
LOS ANGELES (AP) - An arsenal of analytic tools used to 
figure out the makeup and distance of stars and galaxies 
has failed to unlock the secrets of a mysterious celestial 
light detected three years ago.

<p>
<a name="2387qlink1">``It's fairly uncommon to stumble on something you don't <br>
have a clue about,'' astronomer S. George Djorgovski said 
Tuesday. ``It certainly hasn't happened to me, and I've 
been doing this for many years.''</a>

<p>
Djorgovski was part of the team at Caltech's Palomar 
Observatory that detected the object, a pinpoint of light,
during a digital survey of the northern sky.

<p>
It remains one of the biggest mysteries uncovered by the 
Digital Palomar Sky Survey. The survey, which has collected 
information on more than 50 million galaxies and about 2 
billion stars, is about two-thirds complete.

<p>
Some astronomers believe the object may be a new class of 
quasar, sources of energy found in the center of galaxies 
and believed to be powered by matter falling into massive 
black holes.

<p>
``This sort of looks a little like them, but not quite. The similarity may<br>
be superficial,'' Djorgovski said. ``That's
the closest thing we have found in all the astronomical 
literature.''

<p>
Usually, astronomers are able to determine an object's 
composition and distance by breaking down and analyzing 
its light. But the mystery object's spectrum does not fit 
any of the known patterns, Djorgovski said.

<p>
Light also usually holds clues about an object's distance. 
But because graphs derived from the light do not match 
anything known, researchers aren't sure whether it is 
inside or outside the Milky Way galaxy.

<p>
Repeated photographs revealed no changes in its appearance, 
ruling out the possibility that it's an exploding star or 
supernova.

<p>
Djorgovski challenged fellow astronomers to help explain 
his discovery at the June meeting of the American Astronomical
Society in Chicago. So far, nobody has produced an adequate 
explanation.

<p>
``We probably have looked at the spectra of several thousand <br>
quasars, and this just doesn't seem to fit,'' said
David Crampton, an astronomer with the National Research 
Council of Canada. ``It didn't ring any bells.''

<p>
The next step will be to analyze the object's infrared 
spectrum, something Djorgovski hopes to do next month at
the Keck Observatory in Hawaii.

<p>
Researchers also hope that the Hubble Space Telescope might 
someday be pointed at the object, which is located in the 
constellation Serpens.

<p>
``But it's very competitive to get time on the Hubble, and <br>
they don't like fishing expeditions,'' he said.
