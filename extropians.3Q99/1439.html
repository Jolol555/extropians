I said that Alpha particles that hit living tissue were extremely
dangerous, especially when they don't kill a cell but only mutated it.
<a name="1469qlink2">Robert J. Bradbury &lt;bradbury@www.aeiveos.com&gt;  then quotes
from Alpern's Radiation Biophysics in an attempt to prove I'm wrong.
</a>
Perhaps I'm a little slow on the uptake but I'll be dammed if I can see how
it proves anything of the sort, especially when it includes passages like:

<p>
    " transformation by plutonium-238 alpha particles in Balb/3T3 cells was
     substantially *higher* than that for cell lethality."

<p>
AND

<p>
    "At equivalent doses, alpha particles were substantially more cytotoxic than
     gamma rays and were more efficient in inducing oncogenic transformation."

<p>
<a name="1450qlink2">In case you hadn't noticed Alpern is talking about cancer, "oncogenic transformation"
just sounds better in a big expensive scientific book.

<p>
<a href="1435.html#1439qlink1">    &gt;Only a *very* energetic particle has enough energy to interact with the DNA</a><br>
<i>    &gt;backbone and produce a double strand break.</i><br>

<p>
Nonsense. In the first place<a name="1469qlink1"> the backbone is not important, it's a break in the rungs
of the DNA ladder that's important because that's where all the digital information is stored.</a></a>
<a name="1473qlink1"><a name="1450qlink3">In the second place, the chemical bonds in the rungs are much weaker than those in
the backbone, although even the strongest chemical bonds are of only a few electron volts .
I'm talking about average run of the mill radiation particles and they have thousands,
often millions, and sometimes many billions of electron volts of energy.</a></a>

<p>
<a href="1435.html#1439qlink2">    &gt;John, you should assume in any discussions that if the material relates</a><br>
<i>    &gt;to biology and/or nanotechnology that I am likely to have in my personal</i><br>
<i>    &gt;library the relevant sources.  If I suggest that you may be inaccurate,</i><br>
<i>    &gt;it is because I have good sources to back up those opinions.  My education</i><br>
<i>    &gt;includes computer science, chemistry, microbiology, biochemistry and</i><br>
<i>    &gt;some physics and astronomy.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1450qlink4">Hey, don't tell me how smart you are, show</a> me

<p>
    &gt;I will willingly and freely admit when I am wrong or on swampy ground.<br>

<p>
<a name="1450qlink5">I will too, should that unlikely event ever happen.</a>

<pre>
     &gt;if you make a claim without being able to back it up, I will slice you and
     &gt;dice you and nail you to the wall.

<p>
<a name="1450qlink6">You're welcome to try but you'll have to do better than quoting long passages from a
book you don't understand.</a>
