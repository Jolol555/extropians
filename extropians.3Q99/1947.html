Yep, the key phrase is "given no major disasters".

For those who don't know, the URL for this is at:

Just reading the titles of the documents makes me uncomfortable.
Of course the interesting thing from my (our?) perspective is that
2025 could well be the post nano-assembler era and therefore a
time of risk with regard to grey-goo (when you would presumably
want some of the capabilities they discuss -- updated via nanotech
of course).

<p>
Most important from my perspective, is there careful consideration of
planetary defense:

For those of you who don't know, the Air Force is currently way out
in front in the effort to discover near-earth crossing objects.
(See <a href="http://llwww.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/index.html">http://llwww.ll.mit.edu/LINEAR/index.html</a>).

the projects to identify space-based hazards to the planet and
the development of the means to neutralize them.
