Ah, you've put your finger on just why I have trouble believing in the determinism fairy
(deterministic QM). Randomness, like entropy, is opaque -- information or structure that is
dispersed isn't retrievable or reconstructible. 

<p>
Your implication seems quite sound to me, and it might be fun to tease out some of the
other consequences. There might even be a neat reductio ad absurdum nested in there (i.e., a
proof that QM cannot be contained in a deterministic theory). Then we'd know that to
violate the HUP or otherwise make QM deterministic, we have to violate one of the axioms said
proof requires -- that's assuming anyone still has an appetite for the problem.

<p>
I ought to take Max's advice and think about this post for three days or so, it's soooo
half-baked :-)
