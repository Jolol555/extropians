Lee,

<p>
I have to step in here (since I at least can claim to have been
up-to-bat a number of times in a variety of circumstances).

<p>
A good starting example of what is being discussed is most of the SPAM
running around that is primarily variants on the "Get Rich Quick" schemes.
(The Buy-In is creating a sales-pitch convincing enough that people swallow
the hook and the "loophole" is that we value freedom-of-speech
more than we value stupid people not being ripped off).

<p>
At the higher level an example of a "so-called" loop holes were
the government set-asides so that a fixed fraction of all
contacts went to minority businesses.  It didn't take long
for some contractors to figure out how to setup shell
companies that met the "set-aside" requirements, even though
the profit ended up flowing into the same pockets as before
the set-asides existed.

<p>
Still higher is a statement, that was attributed to Sen. Bob
Packard a few years ago.  Apparently the Agriculture Comm.
had worked out and had passed a program of agricultural
"subsidies" that would cost the government **no more** than $10B.
Yet a few years latter, the farmers has figured out how to
reallocate their farmland so the program was costing $30B.
Q: Who is smarter -- 100 senators at designing a loop-hole-less
system or a few million farmers with a big incentive to find
the loop-holes?

<p>
If you look at the history of the industry and/or large
corporation executive compensation over the last ~20 years,
the executives have figured out how to make themselves quite
wealthy through both salaries &amp; stock options.  This is
"justified" by the argument that they are enriching the
stock-holders.  In fact it is managed by setting up the
corporate boards with individuals who represent the
executives more than the stockholders.  As an example of this,
I can point out that 3 of the 5 members the board of
Aeiveos Sciences Group were appointed by myself.  If I
had made the company go, I could have easily manipulated the
system to my advantage [*if* I were that kind of guy :-)]
The loophole as far as I can tell is the difficulty of
a small shareholder in getting an agenda item into the
annual meeting and convincing the rest of the shareholders
(many of whom are large mutual funds) to go along with
their perspective of "throw the bum(s) out".  The
large shareholders know that if the stock suffers
a lack of confidence due to a change of management
that is going to cost them a lot more than the
executive compensation package does.

<p>
Finally, I have to cite the big kahoona of people in power
ripping off the system which is the recent example of Russia.
Before, under communism the "leaders" had to maintain the
illusion they were little better off than a majority of
the population.  Under "democracy" and "capitalism" however,
they simply setup systems where the jewels of the empire
were transfered into private hands with the management of
the jewels getting the controlling shares and the politicians
getting kickbacks on the whole process.  Theft of public resources
*or* simply very shrewd people working in their own self-interest
on a scale that makes us America's corporate executives look
like rank amateurs -- you be the judge.

<p>
Little know fact -- members of the Russian parliment (the Duma)
are *immune* from prosecution under the constitution.  Think
about the consequences of that!

<p>
My observation, in the many places I have worked is that people
act in their own self-interest and that if people can find
a way to make the "system" work to their advantage they will
do so.  I think we are probably lucky that we work under a
system that was setup quickly, largely as a reaction to abuses of
another system.  That meant the people doing it didn't spend
too much time thinking about how to rig the system so they
could make it work more for the people who would come into
power than it did for the average citizen.

<p>
