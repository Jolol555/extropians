<p>
I disagree. You can breed superhuman AI from scratch much easier than
to make an upload. Building optimal, or near-optimal nanocomputers is
very easy, and an evolved AI could certainly utilize the optimal
hardware optimally.

<p>
Uploading requires either low-artefact brain vitrification and then
destructive scan or gradual in vivo uploading, with 10^6..10^9
nanomachines operating within your cranium. Doing this will be hard
for us, but trivial to an AI. However, the AI probably has absolutely
no interest in doing our housework for us.

<p>
The gap is only temporal: the supercomputers might use the same
processors, but I don't know very many 3rd-graders who own ~6 kCPU
machines, along with the according infrastructure.
