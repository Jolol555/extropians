&gt;&gt; How, after all, would one ground the notion that
&gt;&gt; "the purpose is to have fun"? Not that,
&gt;&gt; personally I believe such a view has zero merit.
&gt;&gt; I just think it can't (easily, at least) be
&gt;&gt; justified.

<p>
<a href="3491.html#3507qlink2">&gt; Justified in what sense?</a><br>

<p>
Philosophically; or perhaps just in the simple sense of:
convince me. (Ok, not simple.)

<p>

<p>
Doesn't seem so to me (that is, you haven't "convinced me").

<p>

<a href="3491.html#3507qlink4">&gt; contribute to my fellow [trans]human" seems much</a><br>

<p>
Personally, it seems easier to me, though "easier" _definitely_
doesn't mean "easy."

&gt;&gt;&gt; If you are talking about something that would
&gt;&gt;&gt; violate the laws of entropy I would have to
&gt;&gt;&gt; disagree. 

</pre>
<p>
&gt;&gt; Why?

<p>
[....]
<br>
<i>&gt; A more complex answer</i><br>
<a href="3491.html#3507qlink5">&gt; is because a big chunk of what I've been</a><br>
<i>&gt; researching the last two years (what are the</i><br>
<i>&gt; limits to computing [intelligence]) rests on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea that you can't violate entropy. So I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; got a vested interest in SIs having limits. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; would probably believe that SIs have a better</i><br>
<i>&gt; chance of tunneling out of this universe than</i><br>
<i>&gt; violating the laws of entropy. Finally, on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; slippery slope from classical physics to magical</i><br>
<i>&gt; physics, I find it satisfying to draw a line</i><br>
<i>&gt; that says -- "This is as far as I go buddy" (said</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a John Wayne accent).</i><br>

<p>
Understood. To me there are two distinct realms of questioning
(which it is my philosophical goal to connect, though I can't
image succeeding): empirical, and philosophical. If we're
designing something, trying to figure out some question within
the terms of physics as we know it, etc., we're in the empirical
realm. And people who start dealing with "magical physics" in
this realm, are, well..., let's just say I don't "go that far"
either. In the philosophical realm, however, we need to leave
open the question of alternate physics until a foundation for
the physics we have now is established. Without such a
foundation, we simply can't rule out radically alternate
physics.

<p>
The question, for me here, then, is this: to which realm of
questioning does the question about "why we still see stars"
belong? It's in some ways obviously an empirical question. But,
I contend, it's also a philosophical question, since it requires
precisely thought _about_ physics, not just thought _within_
physics.

<p>
<a href="3491.html#3507qlink6">&gt; I'm guess going to have to think a little more</a><br>
<i>&gt; before I can clearly state what the alien's</i><br>
<i>&gt; can't be I guess.</i><br>

<p>
We all have to think more! It's a tricky question.

<p>
Brian.
