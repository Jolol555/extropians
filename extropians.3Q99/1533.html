Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND: Cardiorespiratory fitness and
  body fatness are both related to health, but their interrelation to all-cause
  and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality is unknown. OBJECTIVE: We examined
  the health benefits of leanness and the hazards of obesity while
  simultaneously considering cardiorespiratory
  fitness. DESIGN: This was an observational cohort study. We
  followed 21925 men, aged 30-83 y, who had a body-composition assessment and a
  maximal treadmill exercise test. There were 428 deaths (144 from CVD, 143
  from cancer, and 141 from other causes) in an average of 8 y of follow-up
  (176742 man-years). RESULTS: After adjustment for age, examination year,
  cigarette smoking, alcohol intake, and parental history of ischemic heart
  disease, unfit (low cardiorespiratory
<br>
  fitness as determined by maximal exercise testing), lean men
  had double the risk of all-cause mortality of fit, lean men (relative risk:
  2.07; 95% CI: 1.16, 3.69; P = 0.01). Unfit, lean men also had a higher risk
  of all-cause and CVD mortality than did men who were fit and obese. We
  observed similar results for fat and fat-free mass in relation to mortality.
  Unfit men had a higher risk of all-cause and CVD mortality than did fit men
  in all fat and fat-free mass categories. Similarly, unfit men with low waist
  girths (&lt;87 cm) had greater risk of all-cause mortality than did fit men with
  high waist girths (&gt; or =99 cm). CONCLUSIONS: The health benefits of leanness
  are limited to fit men, and being fit may reduce the hazards of obesity.

<a name="1550qlink2">   "In summary, we found that obesity did not appear to increase mortality<br>
 risk in fit men. For long-term health benefits we should focus on
 improving fitness by increasing physical activity rather than relying
 only on diet for weight control. Aerobic exercise improves IHD risk
 factors, and increases in physical activity or fitness extend longevity.
 Although some studies show that there is no difference between diet and
 aerobic exercise in reducing IHD risk factors, or even report that diet
 is better than aerobic exercise for improving IHD risk factors in
 overweight men, our data show that fit men had greater longevity than
 unfit men regardless of their body composition or risk factor status.
 Obese men should be encouraged to increase their cardiorespiratory
 fitness by engaging in regular, moderate intensity physical activity;
 this should benefit them even if they remain overweight."</a>


<p>
 Additional note by poster:

<p>
   Although weight loss through dieting is associated with improvements in
 some IHD risk factors, what is not widely recognized is that other IHD
 risk factors are worsened. These include increased homocysteine, lower
 HDL, and reductions in intake of heart protective omega-3 fatty acids,
 and possibly reduced dietary arginine (nut) intake. These are some of the
 factors that may explain why most studies have found that dieting does
 not lower mortality rates.
<br>
   Although this is not a popular idea, body fatness in and of itself
 appears to be neutral with respect to mortality. Other variables are the
 key determining factors of human life expectancy, and cardiorespiratory
 fitness as measured by a treadmill is one.
