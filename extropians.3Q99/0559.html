	Spike old boy, only in a mathematical context. What I am suggesting
is that we cannot assume that Mathematics in the form that we know and use
it is the ONLY paradigm that can be used by ANY "intelligent" species to
describe conceptual relationships and natural laws etc... 
<p>
	Sure, it seems very logical and consistent to us, but we may be
dropping our nuts on concrete from a great height rather than using the
nutcrackers (the optimal solution). Alternatively, we may have, in
mathematics, THE optimal solution, but we can only say it is optimal for use
by HUMANS. The brain structure and functionality of intelligent creatures
across the universe is most likely very diverse. I've got nothing concrete
to argue with, all I'm saying is that neither have</a> you.

<p>
	Rob.
