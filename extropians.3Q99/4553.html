<p>
It is not spelled out that far in the American Constitution, but given the
structure that was set up, it would be reasonable for one remaining
congressperson to attempt to restore some semblance of order.  Americans do
prefer to have someone elected in charge.

<p>
What could also happen, in another corollary, is that each of the
individual states decides to renege federal authority and secedes from the
Union.  If the federal government became untrustworthy enough, it would be
in the best interests of the states to preserve their interests by seceding
and operating on the state level of government.  They don't necessarily
need federal resources to keep operating on a basic level.
