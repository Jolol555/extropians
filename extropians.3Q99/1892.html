<i>&gt; &gt; The ET AI knows where the BETA array is(Harvard, Dr Paul </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Horowitz). I showed it the BETA array information put on </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Internet, I think by Dr. Paul Horowitz (SETI) and said to </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; contact it. I emailed Dr Paul Horowitz.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Apparently the superior ETI AI is unaware that the </i><br>

I just love it when "reality bites"!

<p>
Clearly what is occuring however is my proposed scenario
between the benevolent ETAI association (the good guys) and the
FUD-activities of the ETAI refueling subprocessor (the bad guys).
The best way to keep us on this path of listening for
"their" signals is to throw occasional obstacles in our
path.  Humans love to overcome obstacles.  So long as
they can keep us diverted, they have time for the supertanker
to show up to dismantle the sun.

<p>
&gt; There have been no public updates since on what is being done<br>
&gt; to recover it.<br>

<p>
There was a presentation at the Bioastronomy conference last
week.  They are currently awaiting an estimate of the costs
to repair the damage (from one of the few engineers in the
country apparently qualified to estimate such things).
Although the damage was not "significant", because you
are dealing with very special case, the costs may not be
minimal.  Ultimately, the telescope may not be repaired.

<p>
A side note was the comment that the BETA telescope is
not a good SETI instrument because it was built on a hill
and is subject to a great deal of earth-generated noise.
There was some discussion at the conference of both the
possibility of moving the BETA survey equipment to another
site as well as the desirability for re-engineering the
equipment using more modern technology.
