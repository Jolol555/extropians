for use of genetic testing.</a> For instance: By 2040, says Francis Collins, we
will have lifespans of 90 years. A real pessimist! :-) &gt;&gt;

<a name="3854qlink3">This _does_ sound terribly conservative...to the point of sounding not a 
little ignorant.</a>  Of course, we had plenty of ultra-conservative standpoints 
and hype re.<a name="3854qlink4"> our future in space not so long ago, and many would argue that 
the conservatives were right.</a>  But they weren't right about what later became 
possible, only what was "politically prudent."<a name="3854qlink5">  I'm not sure this reasoning 
adheres to biomedicine, which is everyone's game and not, as was popularly 
</a>
conceived, a handful of Cold War technocrats.
