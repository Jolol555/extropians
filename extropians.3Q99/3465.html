I take that back!  I had only 2 hours sleep that night and wasn't thinking 
as straight as I should have been when replying to your post.

<p>
It would not require interrupts.  Especially an "isolated" one.  I don't 
know where the Hell you came up with that conclusion.</a>

<p>
All that is required is a near continuous input to produce these constant 
thoughts.  One thought leads to another, leads to another, leads to another, 
etc...  The body's sensory inputs are one of these types of input.  Also 
thoughts act as feedback.  No that is not perpetual.  The energy is coming 
from the chemical reactions in the body.

<p>
Me goal here when I say this is not to offend you but to point out an 
observation.  I'm starting to doubt your understanding of neuroscience.</a>
