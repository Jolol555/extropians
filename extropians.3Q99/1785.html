Not that I'm a (meta)mathemetics whiz or anything (although I have read not 
only Godel, but also Ernst Nagel, Paul Benaserraf, and, most importantly, 
John R. Lucas on "Godelian Incompleteness") but, J.R. Lucas to the contrary 
not withstanding, Godelian Incompleteness with respect to (any) formal 
systems (at least those robust enough to compute/instantiate elementary 
arithmetic), including physical instantiations of such formal systems (e.g., 
discrete state, Turing machines) simply does *not* imply<a name="2148qlink1"> (much less entail) 
</a>
<br>
"free will."<a name="2148qlink2">  Simply because such a Godelian system (including, e.g., human <br>
beings) cannot (always) know what it will do/decide next, this does not 
inherently imply (much less entail) that said system is not utterly 
Laplacianly (or quasi-Laplacianly) determined down to the micro-level, and 
that the future behavior/decisions are not thereby utterly inevitable and 
incapable-of-being-otherwise.</a>  Godelian considerations are more of a 
(meta)epistemic element, rather than an ontological one.  A system or entity 
can be utterly Godelianly epistemicly indeterminate, and still might be 
*physically* determinate down to a micro-level.  Quantum-level 
uncertainty/randomness does nothing for the cause of free-will, either, 
without some theory linking it (say) to some sort of *agent-causation* 
(championed in this century in turn, by Rod Chisholm, Carl Ginet, Richard 
Taylor, and Peter Van Inwagan).  On almost any current theory of quantum 
physics (Bohm/Hiley hidden variable/pilot wave [now somewhat passe], 
Everett/Tipler/Deutsch/McCall Multiverse Ensemble, etc.) free-will is not 
especially well-served.  True, we no longer have Newtonian/classic-Laplacian 
determinism (replaced by Prigoginian dissipative emergence), but we don't 
have sufficient bridge-theory(s)---*yet*---to save free-will from 
quantum-randomness.  And *randomness* is just as bad as strict 
determinism---you sure as hell don't get (what we [used to?] think of as) 
<br>
"free-will" (which is actually agent-determination or agent-causation) out <br>
of utter--"mindless"--randomness.

<p>
<a name="2221qlink2">What is needed is a robust theory of agent-causation which takes into 
account--indeed, incorporates--state-of-the-art quantum-</a>cosmology (here 
broadly conceived to include Prigogine's stuff).  No philosopher/scientist 
has yet done this (at least nowhere near completely and thorough-goingly), 
but some interesting groundwork has been laid by the philosophers Peter Van 
Inwagan and Storrs McCall (among a few others).  I don't have specific 
citations handy, but I'll look 'em up and get 'em to whoever wants 'em. (I 
should note, however, that when I say  groundwork, I mean, to extend the 
metaphor, only [so far] scratching the service!)

<p>
I'm all for freewill, but Godelian Incompleteness in and of itself doesn't 
get it for you.

Ciao!

P.S. Philosopher Edward Pols, of Bowdoin College in Maine, has also done 
some good stuff on the metaphysics of agency, extending the work of 
Whitehead, Polanyi, and others.  See, e.g., his *Meditation on a Prisoner: 
Toward Understanding Action and Mind* (Carbondale, Il: S. Il. U. Pr., 1976), 
and his later stuff.  He spins some interesting metaphysics--indeed, quite 
sound in my judgment--but fails to link it to contemporary physical 
concepts.  Still worth reading, though.
