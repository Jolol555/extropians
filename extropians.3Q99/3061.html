As a kid up to the age of 16 or so I was a LONER. I fondly recall the
countless hours I spent in my grandmothers spacious attic with a stack of 20
year-old National Geographics and the 1952 dedition of World Book.Later as I
got into my high school years I was pretty much the "cross-clique kid" that
Greg Burch described. I had no problem whatsoever mixing in with the
"Brains", the "Nerds", the "Jocks" or the "Dopers." That socialization was
confined to school though, away from classess I was still pretty much a
loner.
<br>
About the last two years of high school I became lifelong friends with a
"Brain". We happily spent the last two years of high school
attending countless Star Trek conventions, L-5 Society meetings etc...
