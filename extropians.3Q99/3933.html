<a name="3958qlink1">Oh, that was at least a coupla months ago. Been going over old mail?
What I basically said was that the three greatest accomplishments of
women's suffrage was  the Gun Control Act of 1968 (actually its a
translation of the Nazi Weapons Law), Prohibition, and Bill Clinton...
in that order of importance.</a>

<p>
<a name="3940qlink1">I think when all is said and done we will find that the only President
who rivals Clinton in corruption, abuse, and outright disregard and
distain for the Constitution is Nixon.</a>

<p>
As it turns out, we are now finding out how Roger Altman, Clinton's
original Sec'ty of the Treasury, under the guidance of Hillary and Vince
Foster, staged the ATF raid on Waco from his and the ATF's offices in
Little Rock as a Press Conference In Action to promote a new gun control
law. The local ATF office head was calling as many former Branch
Davidians he could find to dig up evidence of child abuse by Koresh.
Since when is child abuse the jurisdiction of the ATF? Its not paranoia
if they really are out to get you.

<a name="4014qlink1"><a name="3958qlink3"><a name="3958qlink2"><a name="3946qlink1">I've said it once and I'll say it again. A large number of women do not
regard freedom to be nearly as important as security. They will, by and
large, prefer to trade freedom for greater security and protection.</a> This
<a name="3958qlink4">is their nature as maternal beings that prefer consensus and compromise
to ideals and principles.</a> This is why the whole, "don't be cruel, it's
for the Children" routine the democrats always pull is so effective, as
it tugs at the  maternal memes that women have. The great erosion in
privacy and individual liberty in this century began after we granted
women the right to vote. To Kathryn and other women on the list who
probably take offense at this, I challenge you to prove me wrong.</a></a>
