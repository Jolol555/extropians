We've got lots of ideas for refining and expanding the timeline project as a 
feature for ExI's website, which we'll be discussing at EXTRO4.  In the 
meantime, please provide your input with the current site!

<p>
We've intentionally limited the timeline to 2020 because we want to try to 
keep things as concrete as possible.  Many people think the possibilities of 
matue nanotech make projections beyond 2020 or so very difficult, so for now 
we've imposed that arbitrary cut-off.  In future versions of the timeline 
website, dicussion of such possibilities will likely be easier.
