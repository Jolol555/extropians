<a href="4648.html#4682qlink1">&gt; `machine' is made out of? What on earth makes you think its phase space is</a><br>
<i>&gt; `rigid' (assuming that assertion makes any sense)?</i><br>

<a name="4704qlink1">The Turing machine is made out of normal stuff, it's the computer sitting in 
front of you.  Its the interaction of the machine with the environment that 
affects the time line.  The quantas making up the fabric of the universe are 
computing under constraints.  There are overarching constraints existing before 
the big bang, the constraints added moments after, and there are recent, 
temporary, highly localized constraints such as the restriction of gun threads 
on this mailing list.  The quanta compute many potentials, but to keep dogs from 
turning into cats and cups from unsmashing certain constraints interact with 
quanta to maintain the reality we know.</a>

<p>
A Turing machine has a rigid phase space because it has a finite internal state 
space and a finite input space.  This doesn't change unless some one rewires the 
machine.  Anyways, you guys have worn me out so I've changed the color of my 
sound and won't be able to respond for a while.
