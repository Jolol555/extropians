<p>
I've never heard of that second version of the MWI before, I always
thought it's entire advantage was that it didn't have to explain what
a measurement is. Do the two-slit experiment, but instead of using film to
stop the photons after they pass the slit, let them head out into infinite space.
If Many Worlds is correct then the entire universe splits into 2 when the
photon hit's the 2 slits and never recombines. There is nothing special
about you the observer, you split just like everything else, you know that
the photon went through one and only one slit, but of course you have
no way of knowing which one. Now let's do the more usual two-split experiment
and put the film back in. The universe splits just as it did before when it passed
the two slits, but when the photon hits the film and it no longer exists in either
universe then the 2 are identical and fuse back together again. Looking back
we find evidence that the photon (or electron) went through both slits and
this causes an interference pattern.<a name="2489qlink1"> Again there is nothing special about an
<a name="2507qlink1">observer in this, the same thing would happen if nobody looked at the film,
or even if you used a brick wall instead of film, because the important thing
is not that  the photon makes a record (whatever that is) but simply that it is
</a></a>destroyed.  Mind  has nothing to do with any of this so I don't need to
explain it, or measurement, or representation, or consciousness.
