Those of you who haven't seen it, should pick up the October, 1999
issue of Popular Science.  Its the one with the cute martian covered
in aluminium foil on the cover.

<p>
I've read the entire collection of articles and they are mostly
right on.  There is an interesting piece about somatic gene
therapy (pgs 82-86).  Interesting quotes:
<p>
   "Oddly enough, I'm concerned about our success."

<UL>
  <li>  Wilson (Univ. of Pennsylvania, Institute for Human Gene Therapy)


</UL>
<p>
   (because big-pharma may not want to fund something you only need
    to take once in a decade)

<p>
  "Gene therapy's battle cry used to be 'delviery, delivery, delivery,
   ... Now, the key is efficacy.  People want to see that this can work."

<UL>
  <li>  Inder Verma (Salk Institute)


</UL>
<p>
Of course, there was an interesting mention of different delivery
methods -- naked DNA, artificial chromosomes, lentivirus (HIV-like),
and of course Adeno-Associated Virus (which persons who shall remain
nameless seemed uninformed about at the Extro4 conference).

<p>
Also a very brief mention about Cryonics for people who are waiting
for new-tech to become available.

<p>
Jeesh, at this rate, I'm not going to have anything interesting
to talk about at cocktail parties.

<p>
R.
