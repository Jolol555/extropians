From: "Robert J. Bradbury" &lt;bradbury@www.aeiveos.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="2840.html#2844qlink1">&gt;Exactly!  If we assume that most of the fears and naysaying is</a><br>
<i>&gt;unjustified (because the people don't understand the relative</i><br>
<i>&gt;risks), then your "right" to have free and complete access to</i><br>
<i>&gt;information is conflicting with my "right" to buy the cheapest</i><br>
<i>&gt;food products.  If some people have and *misinterpret* the</i><br>
<i>&gt;information, then companies fail to develop markets that would</i><br>
<i>&gt;otherwise be benificial to everyone.  [You don't have to buy it if</i><br>
<i>&gt;its engineered, but you shouldn't be able to force me into not</i><br>
<i>&gt;being able to buy it as well.]  Furthermore, if you look at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;agenda of the anti-Ag-Bio people, they not only want to take away</i><br>
<i>&gt;my right to buy cheaper food, they want to take away *your* right</i><br>
<i>&gt;to grow such food.  So it would appear that you have a logical</i><br>
<i>&gt;conflict between your desire for full disclosure and your desire</i><br>
<i>&gt;to grow whatever crop you feel like on your property.  [I'm</i><br>
<i>&gt;assuming that you would argue fairly strongly that if you want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;grow *any* crop you should be able to do so.]</i><br>

<p>
Yep, sounds like a court issue, which takes precedence, my right to
know or your (their) right to spray massive quantities of roundup.
As long as I get the right to sue for damages....

<p>
You don't have to tell me about anti's, I'm NRA remember... ;)


<p>
<a href="2840.html#2844qlink2">&gt;Now, I suspect that companies would still develop the products</a><br>
<i>&gt;because there are people who can interpret the relative risks</i><br>
<i>&gt;properly.  They might do some educational advertising or fund PBS</i><br>
<i>&gt;specials, etc.  It would all take longer though because the ROI</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be slower.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, this would be a good idea, actually a smart company could do
both, you could have your Campell's "cream of genetically
engineered "FlavvrSavr" tomato" for 50 cents, or your Cambell's
"cream of organically grown Brandywine tomato" for 2 bucks.

<p>
<a href="2840.html#2844qlink3">&gt;The real *sticky* point is going to revolve around the</a><br>
<i>&gt;cross-pollination and "natural crop" contamination issues.  Who</i><br>
<i>&gt;should have to bear the burden enclosing their crops in "safe</i><br>
<i>&gt;zones" (miles from other crops, greenhouses, etc.), the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gene-Engineers or the Naturalists?</i><br>

<p>
Court time again.... I think it depends on venue....contaminating
an organic crop in California for example might get you the death
penalty.... ;)

<p>
Actually from a marketing standpoint it depends on each product. I
see micronutrient rice as getting considerably less opposition than
our favorite whipping boy "Roundup corn".
