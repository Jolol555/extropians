Until you reach a point when you never get lost. You could plunk me down
anywhere with no map and no compass, and if there is civilization
anywhere, I'll find it, the fun contest is finding enough food to keep
going. Once you've seen one leaf, you've seen them all.<a name="4719qlink2"> I'm sure the
exercise, the totally immersed environment might have a contributing
factor, as its a much higher bandwidth input than any simulator game,
</a>
but the hunt is the real fun.<a name="4719qlink3"> As Lazarus Long said, "I've had the most
fun when I wasn't sure where my next meal was coming from."</a> Man was
evolved as a hunter-gatherer. The agriculture thing was just a way to be
able to make more beer.
