&gt;&gt; There are definitely some schools of thought
&gt;&gt; that make such claims, but, in my view they fail.
&gt;&gt; How, after all, would one ground the notion that
&gt;&gt; "the purpose is to have fun"? Not that,
&gt;&gt; personally I believe such a view has zero merit.
&gt;&gt; I just think it can't (easily, at least) be
&gt;&gt; justified.

<p>
Assumption: life is supposed to be, or MUST be, fun.
Assumption: "fun" means the same thing to, or results from the same thing for,
everyone.

<p>
Don't agree, myself. Though I have more fun when life is fun, to be sure!!

&gt;&gt; Empirically, yes, this is our only option. But
&gt;&gt; in deciding whether or not aliens might pervade
&gt;&gt; our world, we can entertain other options.

&gt; I'll drink to that.<br>

Me too!
