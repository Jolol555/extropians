<p>
I was socially rejected in elementary and junior high, but that is because I 
hadn't learned the social protocols of the time among that age group.  I 
blame that partially on my dysfunctional parents for which my mom is very 
retarded.

Midway through high school I learned via observation how to handle different 
situations and now I have no problem making friends.  In fact I'm now 
becoming the popular one.  A combination of self satire and impressive 
knowledge helps.
