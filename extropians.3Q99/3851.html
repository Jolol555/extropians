Technically:

<p>
They didn't engineer Antennapedia or Bithorax, they found them.  We probably
could engineer them now; alterations to developmental genes are pretty routine
for the major experimental animals.  Also, those particular mutations are to
region-identifying genes.</a>

<p>
Yes, but it gets harder away from pet organisms.  Details matter; a lot of 
these
<br>
things are concentration-dependent and you have to get the concentrations
right.  It's a real problem for "engineering" people - in addition to ethical 
issues
<br>
about lack of choice there's a very high chance that you'd make a few goofs
</a>
fine-tuning the process and that's *really* unacceptable.
