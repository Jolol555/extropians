<a name="3726qlink2">Look. This is a really interesting article you have presented. However, Japan 
being depicted as being filled with nothing but oldsters can't be right-or at 
least the focus isn't.  Perhaps the Japan of the 2010 -2050 era may be 
depicted as a place which has lossed a huge amount fo population compared to 
</a>the 1980's.<a name="3707qlink2"> But conversely, is a much richer place because of computerized 
robotic technology and a smaller population to support. Lets say that a 
population of 75-80 million(versus 120 million today) isn't exactly, a dearth 
of people for a total land area the size of Oregon.</a>

<p>
For me personally, it evokes a vision of a very advanced society that is 
geared for the future, yet also closely bound to it ancient past.  Now what 
China and India and Indonesia have to say about  what Japan becomes is 
another story.
