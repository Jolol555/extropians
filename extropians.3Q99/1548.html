Yeah, the Puppeteer's plot to add the birth lotteries to the human
society supposedly bred it. As for myself, I've often thought of myself
as a sort of Murphy Vortex,<a name="1560qlink1"> that odd and/or bad luck things always tend
to happen to me, that have nothing to do with carelessness.</a> Few if any
good luck things tend to happen.  I find it interesting that studies
I've seen trying to find 'luck' always focus on GOOD  luck, to no avail.
I can't find anyone who has tried to find bad luck deviations from the
norm. 

<p>
The only good result of a lot of my odd or bad experiences is that I
have a lot of stories to tell..
