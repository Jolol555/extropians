<a href="1991.html#1994qlink1">&gt; Since I arrived a bit late to the after-meeting computer-room meeting</a><br>
<i>&gt; and couldn't get in (the sight of the crammed room of listening and</i><br>
<i>&gt; discussingtranshumanists was quite encouraging!), I wonder if somebody</i><br>
<i>&gt; could review what was said, done and planned at the meeting?</i><br>

<p>
Here's my impression of that meeting (Robert, Sasha, Alex, Brent,
or others may want to weigh in if I have omitted or misrepresented
something):

<p>
Brent Allsop showed the ExI web task list, and invited participation.
Tyler Close demonstrated an application that would be useful for
better automating and securing that and possibly other things (the
"DropLet" software at &lt;<a href="http://www.waterken.com">http://www.waterken.com</a>&gt;).  Sasha went over a
list of many web-related tasks for the future of ExI, what work has
already been done on many of them, and invited participation in the
futureweb@onelist.com discussion group.  After some discussion about
possible short-range improvements to the main discussion list, Alex
Bokov demonstrated Slashdot.  Robert Bradbury gave his vision of
what functionality he thought was necessary for the discussion list,
and agreed with Alex that minor modifications to the Slashdot model
would probably fulfill those needs.

<p>
I think the general consensus was that for the near term, Robert
(bradbury@aeiveos.com) would spearhead the job of upgrading the
existing ExI list to something more functional, possibly based on
the Slashdot collectively-moderated news/dicussion model, and that
can be modified to incorporate more of Sasha's advances as they
become available.
