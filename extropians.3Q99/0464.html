&lt;&lt; &gt;The anti-depressants Paxil and Prozac have the effect in many men of

 I tried Prozac for awhile as an experiment based on
 the "Listening to Prozac" book and found that Prozac
 reduced the frequency of my spontaneous thoughts about
 sex and reduced the desire for sex.  However, I found
 normal response and ability once the decision was
 made to have sex....perhaps this is just a reduction
 in obsessive/compulsive psychology surrounding sex,
 not really a reduction in sex drive...??? &gt;&gt;

<p>
I've been on Prozac for over a year now and it hasn't reduced my sex drive 
even an inkling!  I wish it did live up to it's reputation but I find my 
libido more out of control than ever.
