 as well as rural ones, and if I'm lucky enough to be able to
 leave this planet, I'll probably have to give up most of that
 particular experience at that time, so I'm not eager to give it

 I got from his post ( correct me if I 'm wrong lee) was that the surface was 
then left FREE for parks, shopping, promenades, games, hikes, nature 
preserves, and so forth, so you would be able to go there anytime...  your'e 
not a locked in citizen of an underground city, but resourcing  vast space 
for work and those who chose too  there (probably a hell of a lot cheaper) , 
and save the above ground for recreation and solar power sources etc.
