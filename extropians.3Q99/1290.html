<br>
MOUNT DORA, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--July 27, 1999--American
Millennium Corporation, Inc. (OTC BB: AMCI) reported today that
General Motors Corp (NYSE:GM) has recently purchased 10 of AMCI's
Satellite Communicators (SCs) for testing purposes.

<p>
AMCI Chief Technical Officer Bruce R Bacon stated that, "Using the
ORBCOMM Satellite Network, the 10 SC's are able to report a vehicle's
global position as well as send and receive email to the vehicle's occupants.
GM's Truck Engineering Group has been running trials using our units
to track their test vehicles across the US over the Internet. For several
months we have been working on additional software applications to meet
the needs of their engineers for remote communication with the vehicle 
itself."

<p>
AMCI President and CEO Andrew F. Cauthen stated, "We had provided
two of our units for "proof of concept" trials to the GM Truck Engineering
Group last fall. This initial purchase of additional test units from such a
prestigious company as General Motors is a major milestone in our
business development."

<p>
AMCI is a licensed value-added reseller for ORBCOMM USA, L.P. that
provides two-way monitoring, tracking, and messaging service through
the world's first low-earth orbit satellite based data communications
system. ORBCOMM is a partnership owned by Orbital Sciences
Corporation (NYSE:ORB) and Teleglobe, Inc. of Canada, (NYSE:TSE).

<p>
This press release contains forward-looking statements that involve risk
and uncertainties that could cause the company's actual results and
experience to differ materially from anticipated results and expectations
expressed herein. In particular, AMCI's plans may be revised, and its
actual results may differ materially from that indicated by its current plans.
