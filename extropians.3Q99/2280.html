Charlie Stross has one, slightly icky, answer to what would give them
input enough in his novel Scratch Monkey
(<a href="http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/index.html">http://www.antipope.org/charlie/fiction/index.html</a>).

<p>
However, a more likely answer would be something along the lines of
David Zindell's description of what the Solid State Goddess (a nebula
filled with connected jupiter-brain nodes): she studies evolution, not
just of all possible biological systems, but evolution of all forms of
complex systems, and evolution of evolution, and so on.

<p>
"I was given to understand that She manipulated whole sciences and
thought systems as I might string words into a sentence. But Her
'sentences' were as huge and profound as the utterances of the
universe itself."

<p>
She also amused herself with "testing" space pilots brave/stupid
enough to venture into her nebula, most likely as an idle amusement.
