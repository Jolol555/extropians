<i>&gt;KEO NEWSLETTER NO. 3 - SUMMER 1999</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Reuters, CNN and Discover launch an influx of messages</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;April in Paris saw the arrival of spring, the trees in leaf on the grand</i><br>
<i>&gt;boulevards and signs everywhere of Nature and the Parisians shaking off</i><br>
<i>&gt;winter's slumber.  A fresh influx of messages from all over the world</i><br>
<i>&gt;echoed this springtime reawakening, thanks to the impact of KEO coverage in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the media by Reuters, CNN TV and Discover Magazine.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jonathan Oatis' report on KEO went out on Reuters' media wires in April and</i><br>
<i>&gt;was taken up by newspapers around the world from the Beijing Youth Daily in</i><br>
<i>&gt;China, Diario La Hora in Chile, The Star in South Africa to Hamshahri in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Iran.  CNN TV gave it a slot on Lou Dobb's Moneyline program and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;dispatch featured on web sites in USA, Russia, China, Brazil…the list goes</i><br>
<i>&gt;on.  In fact, we are still trying to track down copies of all the articles</i><br>
<i>&gt;printed and we would like to thank all of you who spotted such coverage and</i><br>
<i>&gt;posted or e-mailed it to us.   You'll see your names mentioned in our media</i><br>
<i>&gt;coverage on the KEO web site!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;June saw Discover Magazine devote a six-page spread to KEO that resulted in</i><br>
<i>&gt;hundreds of letters pouring in.  Three main groups emerged when we sorted</i><br>
<i>&gt;through the mail: men and women in the 70+ age bracket, prisoners from a</i><br>
<i>&gt;number of state penitentiaries in the USA, and teachers and their pupils.</i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, a month ago, we received messages from an adult learning group</i><br>
<i>&gt;on forms pre-printed by their local library.  This morning an envelope with</i><br>
<i>&gt;200 messages arrived from high-school students in California accompanied by</i><br>
<i>&gt;a letter from their teacher of Earth and Environmental Sciences.  We are</i><br>
<i>&gt;also very pleased that KEO is beginning to make inroads into prisons-one</i><br>
<i>&gt;prisoner who is unable to write got someone else to transcribe his message,</i><br>
<i>&gt;which was then sent by post to France.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;From Over the Moon to Man on the Moon</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With the 30th anniversary of the historic moon landing being celebrated</i><br>
<i>&gt;this month, it's a nice coincidence that French state television in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;recent broadcast should ask two astronauts, Jeffrey Hoffman and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jean-Jacques Favier, what message they would like to leave to future</i><br>
<i>&gt;generations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Hoffman replied: "I'm sure that in 50,000 years' time, humanity will</i><br>
<i>&gt;inhabit many other worlds, but I hope that when KEO returns to Earth, our</i><br>
<i>&gt;descendants will remember that it was we who were the first to leave this</i><br>
<i>&gt;planet."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And Favier had this to say: "I consider that one of the characteristics of</i><br>
<i>&gt;our world is its diversity and I hope that in 50,000 years' time, this</i><br>
<i>&gt;diversity will continue to exist on our planet and in our world."</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your message counts</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Reuters put it succinctly "you can participate"; Discover headlined</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Wanted: Your message in a time capsule designed to last 50,000 years."</i><br>
<i>&gt;Your message does count.  The aerospace and hi-tech industries may give KEO</i><br>
<i>&gt;a physical form but only your message and everyone else's will succeed in</i><br>
<i>&gt;giving KEO a heart, in breathing life into this passive satellite.  We are</i><br>
<i>&gt;counting on you to help us carry KEO throughout the world before it finally</i><br>
<i>&gt;leaves the Earth in 2001.  And "word of mouth" is one of the friendliest</i><br>
<i>&gt;ways to let people know that they too can write their message for</i><br>
<i>&gt;posterity.  There is a place for everyone on this project and a place for</i><br>
<i>&gt;everyone's message.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So far, we have received messages in 53 languages from 90 countries.  Forty</i><br>
<i>&gt;new countries since our last newsletter in March!  The latest to join</i><br>
<i>&gt;includes Iran, China, Kuwait, India, Uzbekistan, Madagascar, Tanzania,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Costa Rica and Burkina Fasso. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Official backing of UNESCO</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No wonder then that UNESCO has called KEO a "grand mobilizing initiative".</i><br>
<i>&gt;In a letter from the Director General to Jean-Marc Philippe dated 8 May,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Federico Mayor confirms that KEO will be the opening project of the 21st</i><br>
<i>&gt;century and he goes on to add:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"The mosaic of messages coming from all layers of society will effectively</i><br>
<i>&gt;give a new image of today's humanity…which will allow us better to define</i><br>
<i>&gt;and influence our common destiny".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;New Partners</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since our last newsletter, we are pleased to welcome new partners to KEO.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The French Space Agency (CNES) has confirmed that it will undertake various</i><br>
<i>&gt;ground tests and ensure that security requirements for the launch are met.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It will also promote KEO at international industry exhibitions, notably the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Third United Nations Conference on the Exploration and Peaceful Uses of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Outer Space (UNISPACE), which is currently being held in Vienna.  Espace</i><br>
<i>&gt;Courbe, another new partner, has made the model of KEO on display at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;CNES stand and has kindly offered to lend its expertise to future</i><br>
<i>&gt;exhibitions around the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Starsem, a commercial launch services company, has confirmed an agreement</i><br>
<i>&gt;in principle to piggyback KEO for free on one of its Soyuz launchers.  A</i><br>
<i>&gt;joint venture of Arianespace, Aerospatiale, the Russian Space Agency and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Russia's Samara Space Center, Starsem will launch KEO on a commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt;mission in 2001.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;New Communities</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Two towns in France have become KEO communities!  The local theatre</i><br>
<i>&gt;company, town council and KEO club in Evry have mobilized their town to</i><br>
<i>&gt;become involved in the project through a variety of activities designed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;appeal to every age group, the unemployed and disabled.  The goal is to</i><br>
<i>&gt;reassert the dignity of each individual, bring the community closer</i><br>
<i>&gt;together, increase the sense of belonging among its citizens…and reflect</i><br>
<i>&gt;upon what the town was like in 1999.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In Les Ulis, thanks to the persistence of the theatre's technical director,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jean-Luc Blaisot, the town council and major have adopted KEO as their Year</i><br>
<i>&gt;2000 leitmotiv and are organizing a variety of exhibitions, encounters,</i><br>
<i>&gt;interactive events and shows from April to May next year.  The council has</i><br>
<i>&gt;allocated a budget and appointed one person full-time to work on what they</i><br>
<i>&gt;call "A Project for the Town".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;And by the way, don't forget to let us know what you are doing locally-we</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be very pleased to feature your stories here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On a winning streak</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;We are delighted to let you know that the KEO web site has won two leading</i><br>
<i>&gt;digital media awards.  In March, www.keo.org won the jury's special prize</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the "Clics d'Or", France's equivalent of an Internet Oscar, organized by</i><br>
<i>&gt;IBM, Yahoo!, Colt and CB News.  Present at the handing over of the trophies</i><br>
<i>&gt;was Dr. Vinton Cerf, one of the founding fathers of the Internet, and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Jean-Noël Tronc, special advisor in information technology to the French</i><br>
<i>&gt;Prime Minister.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The winning streak continued in May when www.keo.org won 2nd Prize in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Prix Ars Electronica.  Considered the leading international prize in</i><br>
<i>&gt;digital media, the 13th annual Ars Electronica attracted a record number of</i><br>
<i>&gt;2119 entries from 60 countries with artists, scientists, researchers and</i><br>
<i>&gt;professionals from the field of entertainment taking part.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the net category, the winner was Linus Torvalds of Finland for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;operating system "Linux" - today one of the most important server operating</i><br>
<i>&gt;systems on the Internet.  So we are delighted to come second behind such a</i><br>
<i>&gt;prestigious winner.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The KEO team would like to thank everyone at BaBeL who have given so much</i><br>
<i>&gt;of their talents and their time to help make this possible! </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Looking Beyond</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Of course the nicest prize of all would be to get a message from everyone.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Discover magazine notes that writing a message for 50,000 years time is</i><br>
<i>&gt;"like looking down at home from 50,000 feet; it may give you vertigo…but it</i><br>
<i>&gt;certainly gives you a different perspective.  [The] goal is to get people</i><br>
<i>&gt;to look beyond their desks and kitchens and crowded roads and ponder what</i><br>
<i>&gt;is important, and what kind of future they want to create for their world."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Karin Jestin in the same article compares KEO to a giant jigsaw puzzle,</i><br>
<i>&gt;with each message being one of its pieces.  There are still many pieces</i><br>
<i>&gt;missing at the moment.  So we do hope you will help us find them and fit</i><br>
<i>&gt;them in.  And remember you can send your message either via Internet at</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://www.keo.org">http://www.keo.org</a>, or by regular mail (4 pages max) to: KEO, 65 bis,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Boulevard Brune, 75014 Paris, France.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As spring turns to summer, we think of those among you getting ready to go</i><br>
<i>&gt;away and we wish you a wonderful summer break.  For those of you living</i><br>
<i>&gt;where it isn't summer right now or who are unable to take holidays, we hope</i><br>
<i>&gt;this letter has brightened up your a day a little.  And we will be back</i><br>
<i>&gt;with you all in September!</i><br>
