<a href="3179.html#3218qlink1">&gt;I am told by a Unitarian friend that Unitarians have the highest &gt;average</a><br>
<i>&gt;household incomes, $100,000K+.  Episcopalians come in second.</i><br>

<p>
Realy?! (eye brow raised)  and I hear churches are good places to meet 
woman. ;-)

<a href="3179.html#3218qlink2">&gt;The only time anyone mentioned Satan was a song for children that</a><br>
<i>&gt;had the line "And if the devil doesn't like it, he can sit on a &gt;tack."</i><br>

<p>
Cute song.

I've been to several churches my self.  I usualy go to one every few months 
to keep up with the ideas.  I'm one who likes to debate, and as someone who 
likes to talk I need to know what I'm talking about.  I make it a point to 
know at least something about every doctrine.  How else could I argue 
against it. :{-)

<p>
I think I'll visit the Unitarian Church next week.  I think I could get some 
good arguments from them.  And maybe a wife.  Just kidding.

Jesus said, "Follow me and I'll make you fishers of men."
Clint said, "Follow your own ideas and you shall be set free."
