I'll take your lead, Nick.

<p>
Right now, I'm doing book signing and radio/print interviews for the 2nd
edition of my self-published book _Create/Recreate: The Third Millennial
Culture_.  I'm very delighted with the content of the book -- more essays,
less images.  I'm currently planning a signing at a very well known
bookstore Midnight Special, in Santa Monica, and also one in Silicon
Valley.  I will read from my book about the beginnings of transhumanism and
how to influence culture by spreading positive creative extropian memes.

<p>
I would like to invite those of you who have writings, essays, books, etc.
to send me your work and to possibility join me at these events.  I think
it would be quite wonderful event!

<p>
Please contact me privately.

<p>
Thank you.

<p>
Natasha
