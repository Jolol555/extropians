<i>&gt; It sounds like one could argue that that is all humanity is</i><br>

<i>&gt; a "sub-problem" of the problem of advancement to the next</i><br>
<i>&gt; level.  Or is that stretching it too much?</i><br>

<p>
Yes, it is stretching it too much.  When I say "sub-problem", I'm not
talking about sub-goals.  I mean that a large problem breaks up into a
lot of little problems which require qualitatively different types of
thinking, just as a corporation breaks up into a lot of different
specialties.  Because each specialty can be optimized independently - by
all of the abilities working in concert - there isn't the
sterility/bottleneck problem you'd get from one ability working to
optimize itself.

<p>
<a name="0091qlink1"><a href="0067.html#0074qlink2">&gt; I mean, when I think about your suggestion, I can imagine what</a><br>
<i>&gt; (for example) my wife would say.  Something like "what a dry</i><br>
<i>&gt; and sterile existence"!  But I would argue, and maybe you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; too, that the "sub-problems" are really what life is all about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; And I always think it's rather Anthro-centric to think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; appreciating art and beauty and so forth are peculiar human</i><br>
<i>&gt; abilities.</i><br>

<p>
Actually, I'm still not quite sure where beauty and music and laughter
come from.  I think it has something to do with sexual selection, but I
don't know enough to duplicate it.  They don't get any more peculiar
than that.

<p>
<a href="0067.html#0074qlink3">&gt; I personally think that they are just ways of</a><br>
<i>&gt; thinking about patterns and analogies, an ability which an AI</i><br>
<i>&gt; will certainly have.  I.e., "sub-problems"!</i><br>

<p>
But then why do they cause joy?  And is the joy of seeing a beautiful
<a name="0091qlink2">MotOS the same kind of joy as seeing an elegant theorem?</a>  If not, which
category does the joy of music belong to, and does it matter whether the
music is "Holding Out for a Hero" or "Little Fugue in G Minor"?
