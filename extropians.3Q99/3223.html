Hey moron, where in my post did I say anything about government
confiscatory policies to fund education? I'm the last person to support
that. Coming from New Hampshire, private school capital of the world, I
know how much better private schools are than public ones, and not one
private school that I know of even allows corporate logos pasted on
students or school property.
