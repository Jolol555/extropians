<a name="2257qlink1">Emlyn and Jodie,

<p>
I just want to say publicly how much I love the extropian songs the two of 
you have written!  I found it very captivating in the style of Enya.  Do you 
do Klingon weddings? lol  I think that Worf or any Klingon about to tie the 
knot would find your compositions very moving!  I mean that as a compliment 
speaking as a trekkie.</a>

<p>
<a name="2257qlink2">Also I thought that should a sequel be made to the "Flash Gordon" film made 
around 1980 that was a cult classic you and your wife should work on the 
</a>soundtrack.<a name="2257qlink3">  And speaking of sequels...if a "Fifth Element" part two is done 
you must do a song for any blue, angel-voiced humanoids!!</a>

<p>
<a name="2257qlink4">I really was dumbfounded that someone would have such musical talent here on 
the list!  You and your wife are just fantastic in my view.  I cannot wait 
to listen to your next song!  And it was my first time using Mp3 so it was 
doubly cool!  My school computer labs won't let me use it (for obvious 
reasons) so I went to a cyber cafe to listen.</a>

<p>
<a name="2257qlink5">It was will worth the cost.  Will you consider coming out with a CD so 
people can have something substantial to hold in their hand and put with the 
rest of their CD collection?  Are you gifted when it comes to doing album 
cover artwork?</a>

<p>
<a name="2257qlink6">I wish you both the best in life and with your musical efforts.  Take care!

</a><p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
