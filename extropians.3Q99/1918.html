<i>&gt; to remain "joined" for life?" -- that resolves the cloning question</i><br>
<i>&gt; very quickly.  We have a *very* strong perspective, that people should</i><br>

<i>&gt; non-individuals, we will generally promote the technologies that allow</i><br>
<i>&gt; them to become individuals.</i><br>

<p>
I don't quite follow this argument.  What is the connection between
"Siamese Twins" and cloning?  Is it that a cell on my finger, say, is
"joined" to me in the same sense that conjoined twins are joined together,
and that by cloning it I can allow that cell to reach its destiny as an
individual, no longer joined to me?</a>

<p>
<a href="1906.html#1918qlink2">&gt; Cloning is the development of those technologies that promote the</a><br>
<i>&gt; development and prolongevity of life.  To argue that they disregard</i><br>

<a name="1960qlink3">I think there is an issue with regard to cloning, and it is similar to
the one Robert raised with regard to genetic modifications.</a>  A cloned
<a name="1960qlink4">child is someone who is being raised in a situation which is bizarre
by historical standards.</a>  A genetic duplicate of his "parent", he will
<a name="1960qlink5">grow up with the model before him of what he will grow to be, physically
and to some extent mentally and emotionally as well.</a>  It's hard to say
whether this will be good or bad for the child,<a name="1960qlink6"> on balance.  Do we have
the right to create a clone, with the possibility that it will turn out
</a>
to be unpleasant?<a name="1960qlink7">  Maybe most clones will be unhappy, and feel that they
are living a life which is a carbon copy of someone else's?</a>

<p>
<a name="1960qlink8">We can't get the child's consent beforehand, and some people will conclude
that it is ethically wrong to give birth to a child for whom there is
a significant possibility of these kinds of emotional problems.
