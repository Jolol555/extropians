At the risk of wasting yet more bandwith on a tertiary issue, I should
mention that I did not intend to denigrate the recent science on mating,
sex, or whatever the issue was on the female/genetics thread.  There is
some good research (finally) being done, although some of it does reveal
some cultural bias and should be read with that in mind. 

<p>
The main issue, as far as I can tell from the mail I got, is that 'the
mysterious female' was being discussed as if we were some separate species,
and not even present on the lists.  Pretty foul, from what little I saw.  

<p>
Guys, get over it, ok?  Let's move on to more important issues, like
getting more 'dangers' listed so that Waldemar can write a coherent essay
on this for THE TRANSHUMANIST.
