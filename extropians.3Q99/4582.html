    i hear ya. my skeptical hackles were a-bristlin, mostly because of the 
purported incredible amount progress. the thing is, they give fairly 
reputeable-sounding refs. but its sent from a root, for crissakes... and who 
mails from root, anyway? also, i didnt remember signing up for any mail 
updates, or anything, remotely like this.
<p>
    so, i went to <a href="http://www.unitelnw.com/">http://www.unitelnw.com/</a>, and my bogosity meter started 
aiming way over to the red side of things. "intellerstellar space travel"? 
"quantum electronic laser"? "acousto-electromagnetic hologistic resonant 
system"? then their talkin about zero-point energy; this seems to be pivotal. 
wtf. but, ive gotta admit, this setup is waaaaay slick. shit, their site is, 
i hate to admit it, kinda classy... well, at least untill you stop lookin at 
the pretty pictures and read it...
<p>
    some joke. geez us h christos, man. somebody went to some lengths on this 
one... and i bet their gonna get ppl too... on second thought, i dont have 
the neccassary expertise to declare this kosher or not. i honestly dont know 
enough to have an opinion about how viable it is or isnt... ignorance wont 
kill me, yet. o well, nothin to do but learn.

It's

<p>
    hehe my ignorance shines brilliantly through once again: whats a NMR? 
::reaches deep into bellybutton:: nuclear magnetic resonance? if so, i can 
dig that.

absorbed in the masterful (imho) new NIN stuff,
