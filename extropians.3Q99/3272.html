I see two possible problems:

1)  We're so busy trying to sabotage each other's efforts that we all
wind up getting eaten by goo / insane Powers.

<a name="3285qlink3">2)  Iraq gets nanotechnology instead of the US / the AI project has to
be run in secret and is not subject to public supervision and error correction.</a>

<a name="3285qlink4">"Trying to suppress a dangerous technology only inflicts more damage." 
(Yudkowsky's Threats #2.)</a>

<a name="3285qlink5">I'm not sure - still running the numbers, and while I'm an idealist, I
don't trust my own idealism - but maybe "Nonsuppression" should be one
of the Singularitarian Principles.</a>  Or non-initiation of suppression, at
least.  If the Transtopians succeed in regulating AI, I might have no
choice but to push for regulations on nanotechnology, which I'm sure
will be made easier by their having laid the groundwork for techno-panic
of the appropriate authorities.  Thus marginalizing all
ultratechnologies into the hands of renegade states and criminals.

<a name="3285qlink6">Can anyone really think that ve can panic politicians or the media into
pushing for laws that suppress nanotech/AI without their noticing the
existence of AI/nanotech/uploading/neurohacking/genetic engineering? 
You push for the "Nanotechnology Suppression Act" and you'll get the
"Comprehensive Ultratechnology Regulation Bill".</a>

Puts you one up on the Transtopians.  The problem doesn't even seem to
have occurred to them.<a name="3285qlink7">  Who are the "Transtopians", anyway?  My guess is
