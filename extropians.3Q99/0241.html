Actually, people with Kluver-Bucy syndrome demonstrate that reasoning
is not enough to keep you from doing something stupid. They are
fearless, and while they do not jump off buildings (likely because of
all the training they got before their amygdalae atrophied) they quite
often act in "stupid" ways while retaining full cognitive function
just because they have a hard time judging bad actions from good -
they may realize that something is counterproductive, but why select
productive actions over counterproductive? To them they are roughly
the same (when it comes to fear at least; similar stuff for people
with some frontal lobe damage)
