<a name="4306qlink1"><a href="4275.html#4286qlink2">&gt; Seems that the girl's mother, back about 14 years</a><br>
<i>&gt; ago, wanted a daughter.</i><br>

</a><p>
[....]

<p>
<i>&gt; So she</i><br>
<a href="4275.html#4286qlink3">&gt; ran an ad in the local college newspaper</a><br>
<i>&gt; looking for a male to donate</i><br>
<i>&gt; sperm so that she could become pregnant.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A student responded, and they arranged a</i><br>
<i>&gt; contract whereby he would not be</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for any expenses of child raising,</i><br>
<i>&gt; he would not be legally the</i><br>
<i>&gt; child's father, et cetera.</i><br>

<p>
[....]

<p>
<a href="4275.html#4286qlink4">&gt; She sued the girl's father for child support.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Even though they had signed a contract way</i><br>
<i>&gt; back then that the father would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not have to be involved, that he would</i><br>
<i>&gt; bear no financial responsibility,</i><br>
<i>&gt; the father lost the suit. Biology could</i><br>
<i>&gt; not be denied; he was the father, he was</i><br>
<i>&gt; responsible for the child, and this</i><br>
<i>&gt; obligation cannot be signed away.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4291qlink1">Yikes. What a disturbing story. Do you recall the grounds on
which the suit was decided? A contract is a contract, or so it
<a name="4461qlink1">should be. The only grounds for nullification of a contract of
this sort that I'm aware of are: 1) one of the parties to the
contract was a) compelled to sign, or b) not in his/her right
mind; and 2) a lawyer wasn't present during the signing, and
thus one of the parties signed something "not knowing what it
meant/how to interpret</a> it." (These basically all amount to the
same general thing: someone signed something not knowing what
s/he was doing.)
</a>

<p>
I'm not a lawyer, but that's what I've always thought.

<p>
This is of tremendous relevance to me since someone I know well
is getting ready to impregnate a neighbor in very similar
circumstances. She's been to a lawyer, who drafted a document
signing away the father's rights and obligations. But if a court
can later claim the document has no teeth, then why even sign
it?

<p>
If you (or anyone) recall(s) how the suit was decided -- or
knows other relevant information -- I'd appreciate hearing about
it. Email might be best, since this isn't a very Extropian topic
(bdelaney@infinitefaculty.org, or the sig email).

<p>
<a href="4275.html#4286qlink5">&gt; But it does represent an extreme case</a><br>
<i>&gt; where holding the father strictly</i><br>
<i>&gt; accountable for his child's welfare might</i><br>
<i>&gt; be unjustified.</i><br>

<p>
Seems _definitely_ unjustified to me, at least on the basis of
the details you gave.

<p>
Thanks,
<br>
Brian.
