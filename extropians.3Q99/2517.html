You are probably talking about the shapes which can be adopted by
the electron "clouds", which I believe are solutions to the
Schrodinger equations.

I'll provide my current understanding without any details

  <li>  I believe the most recent theoretical work has demonstrated
   that time travel is impossible.  The recent discussions regarding
   antiparticles "going back in time" are the result of a misinterpretation
   of an explanation.  It would have been better if the description
   had been expressed as something like a "mirror image" of the
   time vector, or something that would not have left the impression
   that "time travel" was a reality.  It is not. 

  <li>  Uploading your consciousness appears feasible if nanotechnology is
   feasible.  If nanotechnology is not feasbile, then making an
   approximate "copy" of your "mind", still seems possible.
   It is likely that the the original might have to be destroyed
   in the process.

  <li>  For a "theory of probabilities" Altavista only comes up with
   ~100 web pages, most not very interesting.  For "probability
   theory" it comes up with 17,000+.  One place to start would
   appear to be: <a href="http://bayes.wustl.edu/">http://bayes.wustl.edu/</a>.  That includes some
   links to books and some tutorials.
