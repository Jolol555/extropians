"We think our brain is our most important organ ... but wait, who's telling 
us that?" - some comedian, name forgotten

<p>
Ornstein (book title forgotten, something like Multi-Mind?) and Minsky 
(Society of Mind) came at the same perception from very different approaches. 
They were anticipated by some seven centuries by Dogen Zenji, but that, as 
they say, is another story.

<p>
<a name="0412qlink2">A lot of those self-analysis problems do seem to be easier to state, if not 
to resolve, when you recast them as selves-analysis problems. "I" have 
internal conflicts in large part because "I" have chosen not to acknowledge 
that "I" have a rather large number of sub-personalities with different 
priorities. Several schools of psychology implicitly acknowledge this by 
assigning personality traits to more or less artificial high-level groupings 
such as id/ego/superego or child/parent/adult.</a>

<p>
I have had more success at catching the lower-level agents at work than I 
have at figuring out their "party affiliations." The "I" who campaigns for 
early bedtimes and early arrival at work may or may not be the same "I" who 
wants to study when some other "I" wants to play chess or post to extropians, 
although it's pretty clear that both of them are playing a superego/parent 
role; and none of them, including the hypothetical top-level "I," is 
immutable.

<p>
They don't all disagree on everything, or the whole mess wouldn't work. For 
example, when one of them gives itself a headache from thinking, they all 
suffer for it, so "I" am going to shut up now :-)
