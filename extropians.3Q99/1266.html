Greetings, Neal Stephenson fans! Be informed that
Stephenson's new novel _Cyptonomicon_, 
<br>
which I just finished reading, has its own web site,
www.cyptonomicon.com, and that the web 
<br>
site has a very interesting long non-fiction essay by
Stephenson entitled "In the Beginning 
<br>
was the Command Line" which is mainly about the
history of computer operating systems, but 
does A LOT of interesting digressing into discussions
about culture and other things.

<p>
You may remember the thread a began months ago about
the apparent lack of AI in Stephenson's 
_The Diamond Age_. I haven't written since then, so I
hope you'll forgive me if I discuss 
<br>
what portions of the "In the Beginning..." essay
reveal about his beliefs in other matters 
not related to AI, and how a better understanding of
the novels can be had by knowing where 
<br>
he's coming from.

<p>
Among the things I find fascinating about
Stephenson's writing is that much of it (in 
particular _The Diamond Age_, but also _Snow Crash_)
seemed to me to implicitly reveal the 
<br>
author's opinions on certain matters, but I could
never be sure, because all I had to go on 
was what his characters believed, which could always
be different that how the author felt.

<p>
For example, in the future history of _Snow Crash_
and _The Diamond Age_ (which is a common 
future history; there are strong hints that _Snow
Crash_'s youthful "Y.T." is none other than 
_The Diamond Age_'s elderly "Mrs. Matheson"), one
gets the impression that Stephenson has a 
low opinion of contempory American culture. I say
this because, among other things, he seems 
to portray it as eventually causing a period of
poverty and chaos (_Snow Crash_) followed by 
the rise of more conservative cultures which he
presents in a much more positive light, such 
as phyles "New Atlantis" (a.k.a. the Neo-Victorians),
the "Heartlanders", etc.

<p>
What makes the essay "In the Beginning was the
Command Line" different is that it is 
<br>
NONfiction; it is actually the Neal Stephenson
talking, not John Hackworth. Therefore, I 
found the digressions into issues of culture very
interesting, as they confirmed my 
<br>
suspicions that Stephenson's writings were more than
just cool cyberpunk, but carried certain 
messages such as:
<br>
(1) Some cultures are superior or inferior to others
in that they are more or less likely to 
lead to the happiness and prosperity of their
adherents.
<br>
(2) Contemporary American secular culture is inferior
in the sense of (1).

<p>
Stephenson makes these memes such central themes to
some of his writing that I feel you 
<br>
cannot understand the novels without knowing that
these themes are there.

<p>
The following are highly edited excerpts from
Stephenson's "In the Beginning was the Command 
Line":


<UL>
  <li>  BEGIN EXCERPTS ***
<br>
"It is obvious, to everyone outside of the United<br>
States, that our arch-buzzwords, 
multiculturalism and diversity, are false fronts that
are being used (in many cases 
unwittingly) to conceal a global trend to eradicate
cultural differences. The basic tenet of 
multiculturalism (or "honoring diversity" or whatever
you want to call it) is that people 
need to stop judging each other-to stop asserting
(and, eventually, to stop believing) that 
this is right and that is wrong, this true and that
false, one thing ugly and another thing 
beautiful, that God exists and has this or that set
of qualities...


</UL>
<p>
"The problem is that once you have done away with the<br>
ability to make judgments as to right 
<br>
and wrong, true and false, etc., there's no real
culture left... The ability to make 
<br>
judgments, to believe things, is the entire it point
of having a culture...

<p>
"The global anti-culture that has been conveyed into<br>
every cranny of the world by television 
is a culture unto itself, and by the standards of
great and ancient cultures like Islam and 
France, it seems grossly inferior...

<p>
"The only real problem is that anyone who has no<br>
culture, other than this global monoculture, 
is completely screwed. Anyone who grows up watching
TV, never sees any religion or 
<br>
philosophy, is raised in an atmosphere of moral
relativism, learns about civics from watching 
bimbo eruptions on network TV news, and attends a
university where postmodernists vie to 
<br>
outdo each other in demolishing traditional notions
of truth and quality, is going to come 
<br>
out into the world as one pretty feckless human
being...

<p>
"On the other hand, if you are raised within some<br>
specific culture, you end up with a basic 
set of tools that you can use to think about and
understand the world. You might use those 
tools to reject the culture you were raised in, but
at least you've got some tools...

<p>
"In this country, the people who run things--who<br>
populate major law firms and corporate 
<br>
boards--understand all of this at some level. They
pay lip service to multiculturalism and 
diversity and non-judgmentalness, but they don't
raise their own children that way. I have 
highly educated, technically sophisticated friends
who have moved to small towns in Iowa to 
live and raise their children... Any suburban
community might be thought of as a place where 
people who hold certain (mostly implicit) beliefs go
to live among others who think the same 
way...

<p>
"And not only do these people feel some<br>
<br>
responsibility to their own children, but to the 
country as a whole. Some of the upper class are vile
and cynical, of course, but many spend 
<br>
at least part of their time fretting about what
direction the country is going in, and what 
responsibilities they have..."


<UL>
  <li>  END EXCERPTS ***

<a name="1281qlink1">I think Stephenson's attitudes on these things are
relevant to Extropianism in that many 
<br>
Extropians seem to relish ideas such as the downfall
of the nation-state and the elimination 
of so-called "religious" memes, and a lot of
Stephenson's writings are very cautionary when 
it comes to these sort of Extropian attitudes. (He
may feel that the downfall of the 
<br>
nation-state might be inevitable, but he shudders to
think what life will be like until they 
are replaced by something like "phyles".)</a>
