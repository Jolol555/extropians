<a href="3711.html#3932qlink1">&gt; But an infant has nothing to trade and and obligations can't be</a><br>
<i>&gt;  enforced against a child. So I agree with Crocker except that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  child has one right, to run away. This, I think, was also Murray</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Rothbard's view, although I can't quote a source.</i><br>

<p>
I think this is an overly-static view of the status of children.  Children 
don't remain children: Unless someone interferes with them, they become 
adults.  Thus, with a child (as with any moral and legal subject) one is 
dealing not only with what the person IS, but what they have the potential</a> to 
BECOME.

<p>
<a name="4078qlink2"><a href="3711.html#3932qlink2">&gt;  The current situation, which I call a "cult of the child," where</a><br>
<i>&gt;  children have all the "rights" and the parents have none, is just</i><br>
<i>&gt;  slavery of the productive parents to the unproductive child and I</i><br>
<i>&gt;  have a hard time justifying that!</i><br>

<p>
Again, I think you can only liken the parent's position vis-a-vis</a> the child 
<a name="4078qlink3">to "slavery" by taking a completely static view of the relationship.  You 
have to look backward in time to the point where the parents chose to put 
themselves into the situation of conceiving the child,</a> and forward in time to 
the point where<a name="4078qlink4"> the child is an autonomous moral subject.  Only by putting on 
temporal blinders can you ignore the (to me) obvious moral responsibility 
parents have to their children.</a>

<a name="4078qlink5"><a href="3711.html#3932qlink3">&gt;  I think the problem of enforcing contracts made by/with children</a><br>
<i>&gt;  can be solved if a court (of a government or defense agency)</i><br>
<i>&gt;  approves it in advance, possibily with the advice of a lawyer or</i><br>
<i>&gt;  advocate appointed to represent the child's interests. If the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  court doesn't approve the contract, then the court won't enforce</i><br>
<i>&gt;  it.</i><br>

<p>
I love it when bright people think through a problem and come up with the 
solution that specialists have developed.  This is, in fact, how courts deal 
with this situation every day.  The child's advocate is called a "guardian ad 
litem".  I deal with them and the mechanism of court approval of contracts 
with minors all the time when I have to secure an enforceable release from a 
child or structure some other legal transaction involving a child.  The other 
mechanism for dealing with the rights of children and other "legal 
incompetents" is a trust (a guardian ad litem is actually a "special trust").</a>

<a name="4078qlink6"><a href="3711.html#3932qlink4">&gt;  Children have the right to run away, and fend for themselves.</a><br>
<i>&gt;  This works fairly well right now in many 3rd world countries.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  c.f. "street children." </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3943qlink1">I'm sorry, but I have to differ strongly with the characterization that this 
"works fairly well".  The hordes of "street children" in the Third World 
result from a collapse of civil society and are a tragic mechanism for 
propagating dysfunctional societies.</a>  Such children are poorly socialized and 
<a name="4078qlink8"><a name="4078qlink7">become cannon fodder for tin-pot dictators and other slime.</a>  Where do you 
think the gun-toting armies of 12-year-olds who fight the civil wars in 
Africa come from?  It's statements like this that make people think that 
libertarianism is all about the Hobbesian "war of all against all".</a>

<p>
<a href="3711.html#3932qlink5">&gt; Another possibility is a "Kiddy Pound"</a><br>
<i>&gt;  where parents can bring unwanted children or children can run</i><br>
<i>&gt;  away to. Hopefully, an acceptable parent can be found for every</i><br>
<i>&gt;  child brought in. But if not, then the child can be put back on</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the street. Or, perhaps, if stray children become a pest, an</i><br>
<i>&gt;  unwanted child can be "put to sleep" as we now do to unwanted</i><br>
<i>&gt;  pets.  I don't see how "society" has any motivation to protect a</i><br>
<i>&gt;  child which NONE of its citizens wants.</i><br>

<p>
Just FYI, it was a situation like this that made 19th century England turn 
its back on classical liberalism.<a name="4078qlink9">  We've been paying the price ever since.  
</a>
<a name="3943qlink2">If free people can't develop better institutions to deal with suffering 
children than this, they will get the kind of nanny-state they deserve.</a>  With 
<a name="4078qlink10">respect, I suggest you try to see a performance of "A Christmas Carol"</a> this 
year.
