<p>
But mass transport costs make the puzzle worse!  Let n1 and n2 be
the initial metal amounts at the two stars.  The problem then is:  max
<pre>
P(m1) + P(m2)       such that  m1 + m2 = n1 + n2
      m1,m2     - T*abs(m1-n1)            and  m1 &gt;=0,  m2 &gt;=0

</pre>
<p>
(Note that abs(m1-n1) = abs(m2-n2).)  Assume without loss of generality
that n1 &gt; n2.  If P(m) has diminishing returns (P''(m) &lt; 0), then when
transport costs are very high, m1 = n1 and m2 = n2, so nothing moves.
And when transport costs are zero, m1 = m2 = (n1 + n2)/2.  And for
intermediate transport costs n2 is in the range [n2,(n1+n2)/2].
So we should see at least P(n2) power intercepted from star 2.

<p>
So in this model the only way to explain all those stars we see is
to say they all have very little metal near them, so little that even
when it is all used to intercept starlight, less than 1% of the light
is intercepted.  This isn't true of our system, and I doubt it is true
of a great many.
