Testify! I completely agree. I want out. I am tired of useless gabber
filling my inbox.

</a>
</a>
view, this list seems to be just a bunch of people who like to jabber "about
anything".  You seem to have no rules for posting, if so the rules should be
posted nightly.  Where is any useful information regarding your topic.  Gina
and Doug seem to be the only people who post useful info.  Are there any
other researchers on your list with something other than gossip to say? Just
what is the topic of this list anyway, do any of you know, I wonder?  I have
heard everything from guns, to diaper rash discussed, "figuratively"
speaking.  Most responses are so lightweight and fluffy or what I consider
to be "airhead", is it really worth my time to filter through all the stuff,
where is the meat?  I consider most responses to this list to be exactly or
worse than most "junk mail" and do dunk 99.9 %.  Why should any intelligent
person be on this list, you people should think about this...  Moderator
please, what is the email address for removing ourselves from this list?
