Interesting.  The original scenario did not account for the long line of
<a name="4513qlink1">succession in power in our government.  I would think that a remaining
member of the cabinet, the speaker of the House, the Senate pro temp,
whoever was left, would find themselves under quarantine and running
government via telephone.</a>  Would every successor in our government actually

definitely considers biological scenarios in their threat assessment.  They
do not let all top members of the government fly in one plane, attend the
same meeting, or Presidential address--there's always one person separated
out to avoid a mass assassination (or a mass infection, I guess!)
