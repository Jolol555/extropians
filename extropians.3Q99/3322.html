Mike, I usually agree with your posts, but I have to take issue with you on
this one.  Your point is well taken with regard to one-on-one interactions,
but when you start talking about large groups of people you have to take
into account the fact that some small percentage of them definitely *will*
be irresponsible.  That brings you to the question of benifit vs. harm (i.e.
if 99.9% of all users of X benifit, and 0.1% do something stupid with it, is
the net result good or bad?).  With most hazardous goods (dynamite,</a> hand
guns, printing presses) the harm that one nut can do is relatively small, so
I don't see much of a case for government regulation.  With a few items
(nuclear weapons, and anything with similar destructive potential) the harm
that a single nut can cause is much, much greater than the combined benifits
of all the possible peacefull uses.  If you could buy a nuke at the corner
gun store some of those 'climb-the-tower-and-shoot-pedestrian' nuts would
use them, and the annual death toll would likely be well into the millions.

<p>
If you want to allow private ownership of nuclear weapons, you need to move
society into space so that you don't have to live within the blast radius of
half a million basements.
