<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't agree with Deutsch's suggestion that quantum computers would imply</i><br>

<i>&gt; to say that running Shor's algorithm has used many times the computing</i><br>

<i>&gt; clearly seen to be present; it is put into a superposition of states and</i><br>
<i>&gt; run through a series of transforms, and at the end the answer comes out.</i><br>

<p>
All of the states making up the superposition are most definitely not
present (in this "universe"). They are not there until measured, in which 
case only one of them is there.

<p>
<a href="2189.html#2258qlink2">&gt; The quantum computer is more powerful than an ordinary computer, and</a><br>
<i>&gt; requires correspondingly more care in its preparation and use, but it</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The reason for the computational power is that the machine is put into</i><br>
<i>&gt; a superposition of states.  But such superpositions are observed every</i><br>
<i>&gt; day in quantum experiments, like double slit diffraction.</i><br>

<p>
Consider the argument of the next sentence:

<p>
<i>&gt;Since most</i><br>
<a href="2189.html#2258qlink3">&gt; scientists do not find that this common diffraction effect forces them to</a><br>
<i>&gt; adopt a many-universe model, there is no more reason to expect it from</i><br>
<i>&gt; a successful quantum computer.  The idea is the same, only the degree</i><br>
<i>&gt; of superposition is different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Hal</i><br>

<p>
We already know the majority of physicists do not accept the many
worlds interpretation.  You can't (logically) use that fact to be
an argument against the very issue under discussion.

<p>
Let me run the following argument by you, for discussion purposes:

<p>
<a name="2261qlink2">If a QC carries out a computation requiring 10^500 superimposed
possible states, and actually carries out the computation, then
those states have to be real, since they had a physical effect, as
real as the state (after measurement) we observe in this universe.
Since those states are real, and don't (and can't) exist in this
(visible) "universe", then those alternate "universes" have to be
real. (This is the essence of Deutsch's challenge.)</a> Then, running
your last paragraph backwards, "The idea is the same, only the
degree of superposition is different." "Common diffraction effects"
have same status as QC, therefore common diffraction effects are
also manifestations of the multiverse, (one would therefore seem
to be lead to believe).

<p>
<a name="2261qlink3">(Terminological clarification: Deutsch uses "multiverse" to refer
to the entire collection of alternate "universes", even though
"universe" is a more logical word for the collection...)</a>

   &gt;Hal said that a working quantum computer would not prove that the
   &gt;many world interpretation is correct and he's right, but it would
   &gt;make it much more popular.  You'd have to understand such a beast
   &gt;pretty well to program it and the many world way would probably be
   &gt;the clearest way to think about it.

</pre>
<p>
Perhaps...

<p>
Anyway, if I'm wrong, tell me. I don't mind.
