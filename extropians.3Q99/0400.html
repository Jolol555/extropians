As we say in the rocket science business, one test is worth a
thousand expert opinions.  As for the argument that aliens
<a name="0416qlink1">would likely be so far in advance of humans they would not
use electromagnetic communication, consider that any
advancing civilization would likely *pass through* the
radio era at some time.  For that reason, the advanced
civ might use radio to *intentionally* com with us
primitive barbarians.  Similarly, they might focus the
signal with a laser and intentionally send them toward
our star.</a>

<p>
I am greatly encouraged that we (SETI) have found nothing yet.
It lifts my hopes that humans really are the first ones here,
in which case, aaaallll thaaat stuuuufff is OURS!  A more
cheerful thought can scarcely be imagined.  Room to grow,
extropian friends, lots of it!  {8-]  spike
