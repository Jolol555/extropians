<p>
What do you remember about the events of the day previous to these dreams?

<p>
If you're willing to undergo a bit of a thought experiment, I'd like to pose a series of questions which may facilitate recreating the event and codifying how to replicate it.

<p>
Are you game?

<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;I'm going on record now (and risking my humble reputation) by</i><br>
<i>   &gt;admitting that I've had several experiences which I have yet to</i><br>
<i>   &gt;explain within current scientific knowledge.  This may be due</i><br>
<i>   &gt;not to any 'paranormal' phenomena, but my own ignorance</i><br>
<i>   &gt;of science itself.  I'm *not* claiming nor do I wish to be labeled</i><br>
<i>   &gt;a psychic. Quite the opposite.  Instead, I'm urging the more</i><br>
<i>   &gt;skeptically and scientifically inclined list members to scrutinize</i><br>
<i>   &gt;me report and offer their opionions.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;During my life, I have had numerous experience that could be</i><br>
<i>   &gt;labeled as clairvoyant, out-of-body-travel, and telepathy.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;However, these may not be accurate terms if what I experienced</i><br>
<i>   &gt;was instead an elaborate set of hallucinations.  Therefore I have</i><br>
<i>   &gt;included below only those experiences I have yet been unable to</i><br>
<i>   &gt;rule out with that explanation.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;====</i><br>
<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;Case 1: (Summer '87)</i><br>
<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;I had a dream in which I woke up only to realize that I was still</i><br>
<i>   &gt;dreaming.  This 'lucid' dream became exhilarating.  Since I often</i><br>
<i>   &gt;fly in my dreams I decided to start flying around the room.  In</i><br>
<i>   &gt;this dream my room was dark, but there was still some ligh</i><br>
<i>   &gt;from the sun which had recently set.  The dream felt unusually</i><br>
<i>   &gt;real.  I continued to fly around the room and attempted to fly</i><br>
<i>   &gt;through the roof.  It worked.  Soon I was flying about 100 feet</i><br>
<i>   &gt;above my apartment complex.  I flew to the other side of the</i><br>
<i>   &gt;complex.  In the sky their was a crescent moon and Venus</i><br>
<i>   &gt;shining brightly. I started to smell something on a BBQ.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;I flew down and heard a conversation of the BBQ'ers that</i><br>
<i>   &gt;sounded like Arabic.  It all seemed very real.  Suddenly I</i><br>
<i>   &gt;awoke on my bed.  This time I really did awaken.  I ran to</i><br>
<i>   &gt;my roommate Don and told him of this incredibly vivid dream</i><br>
<i>   &gt;I just had.  I asked him to follow me outside.  It was indeed</i><br>
<i>   &gt;late dusk.  Venus and the crescent moon were in the sky.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;I told my friend that if my dream was right there should</i><br>
<i>   &gt;be two Arabic guys cooking at the other side of the complex.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;So we both ran to the other side only to find the two Arabic guys</i><br>
<i>   &gt;cooking chicken at a the BBQ.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;Case 2: (spring '95)</i><br>
<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;Another lucid dream.  I was flying around again although this time</i><br>
<i>   &gt;I was not in any place familiar.  The scenery was beautiful - lots</i><br>
<i>   &gt;of rolling grassy hills with colorful flowers everywhere.  It was</i><br>
<i>   &gt;sunny and balmy..  I flew over the plains of grass and flowers with</i><br>
<i>   &gt;exhilaration.  I couldn't believe how real everything seemed.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;The smells were completely vivid and real.  I saw a tree in the</i><br>
<i>   &gt;distance.  It was immense.  I flew up to it and I saw my friend</i><br>
<i>   &gt;Nathan sitting underneath it.  He was sleeping.  I tried very hard</i><br>
<i>   &gt;to awaken him. After a moment, his eyes began to open and he</i><br>
<i>   &gt;was delighted to see me hovering above him. I asked him to</i><br>
<i>   &gt;come with me and he fell asleep again.  The dream ends.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;A few moments later I woke up.  My friend Nathan had stayed</i><br>
<i>   &gt;the night and was sleeping on the couch.  When he woke I</i><br>
<i>   &gt;started to tell him my dream, when I got to the tree part, he</i><br>
<i>   &gt;said "wait a second, this describes my dream.  In my dream I</i><br>
<i>   &gt;was hanging out under this huge tree also surrounded by lots</i><br>
<i>   &gt;of flowers.  I saw a bunch of birds in the sky.  I focused on one</i><br>
<i>   &gt;bird and it kept getting bigger and closer.  Then I realized</i><br>
<i>   &gt;it was you!  I couldn't believe it.  You laughed at me and told</i><br>
<i>   &gt;me to fly with you. That's the last thing I remember".  When</i><br>
<i>   &gt;he finished his description, I broke down in tears.  I was</i><br>
<i>   &gt;overwhelmed that somebody else experienced the same dream.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;A dream in which we both shared.</i><br>
<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;======</i><br>
<i>   &gt;</i><br>
<i>   &gt;Despite these two experiences I remain skeptical, but open to</i><br>
<i>   &gt;the possibility that psi phenomena may still exist and eventually</i><br>
<i>   &gt;be explained within a scientific framework.  Because of the</i><br>
<i>   &gt;highly spontaneous nature of my experiences there is no way</i><br>
<i>   &gt;I could reproduce them.  If I could, I would every single night just</i><br>
<i>   &gt;to experience the hedonistic qualities alone.  But of course, without</i><br>
<i>   &gt;reproducibility we don't have science.  I may still be a skeptic</i><br>
<i>   &gt;but I cannot deny my own experiences and their validation by</i><br>
<i>   &gt;other observers.</i><br>
