<p>
Software exists to recognize characters (it usually comes free with
scanners), but that is only for specific characters.  If you want
software which more generally looks for similarities between patterns, or
which classifies patterns, then that sounds a lot like the software the
FBI is developing for classification and identification of fingerprints.

<p>
But if you are just trying to look for similarities between ideographic
characters and constellations and other symbols from various cultures, it
would probably be more fun, and more effective, to just look for
similarities yourself by eye.  The chances are that the best pattern
recognition programs are no better at discerning patterns than what a
careful human can do.  The programs would be much faster for large
volumes of work such as processing mail, but you probably have a much
more manageable number of patterns to compare.

<p>
Astrology is most likely not a scientifically valid way understanding
nature.  But it might be interesting to study as part of a comparison of
cultures.  I would think there would be a lot of information on the
internet.  www.dogpile.com seems to be a good search engine.
