  The effect of exposure to negative air ions
  on the recovery of physiological responses after moderate endurance exercise.

Abstract
<br>
  This study examined the effects of negative air ion exposure
  on the human cardiovascular and endocrine systems during rest and during the
  recovery period following moderate endurance exercise. Ten healthy adult men
  were studied in the presence (8,000-10,000 cm-3) or absence (200-400 cm-3) of
  negative air ions (25 degrees C, 50%
<br>
  humidity) after 1 h of exercise. The level of exercise was adjusted to
  represent a 50-60% load compared with the subjects' maximal oxygen uptake,
  which was determined using a bicycle ergometer in an unmodified environment
  (22-23 degrees C, 30-35% humidity, 200-400 negative air
  ions.cm-3). The diastolic blood pressure (DBP) values during
  the recovery period were significantly lower in the presence of
  negative ions than in their absence. The
  plasma levels of serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine (DA) were significantly lower
  in the presence of negative ions than in
  their absence. These results demonstrated that exposure to
  negative air ions produced a slow recovery
  of DBP and decreases in the levels of 5-HT and DA in the recovery period
  after moderate endurance exercise. 5-HT is thought to have contributed to the
  slow recovery of DBP.

Abstract
<br>
  The physical effects of negative air ions
  on humans were determined in an experimental sauna room equipped with an
  ionizer. Thirteen healthy persons took a wet sauna bath (dry bulb temperature
  42 degrees C, relative humidity 100%, 10 min exposure) with or without
  negative air ions. The subjects were not
  told when they were being exposed to negative air
  ions. There were no differences in the moods of these
  persons or changes in their blood pressures between the two saunas. The
  surface temperatures of the foreheads, hands, and legs in the sauna with
  negative ions were significantly higher
  than those in the sauna without ions. The pulse rates and
  sweat produced in the sauna with ions were significantly
  higher than those in the sauna without ions. The results
  suggest that negative ions may amplify the
  effects on humans of the sauna.

  Treatment of seasonal affective disorder with a high-output
  negative ionizer.

Abstract
<br>
  This study was designed to evaluate the antidepressant effect of
  negative ions in the ambient air as a
<br>
  potential treatment modality for seasonal affective disorder. Twenty-five
  subjects with winter depression underwent a double-blind controlled trial of
  negative ions at two exposure densities, 1
  x 10(4) ions/cm3 or 2.7 x 10(6) ions/cm3,
  using an electronic negative ion generator with wire corona
  emitters. Home treatments were taken in the early morning for 30 min over 20
  days, followed by withdrawals. The severity of depressive symptoms
  (prominently including the reverse neurovegetative symptoms of hypersomnia,
  hyperphagia, and fatigability) decreased selectively for the group receiving
  high-density treatment. Standard depression rating scale assessments were
  corroborated by clinical impressions. When a remission
  criterion of 50% or greater reduction in symptom frequency/severity was used,
  58% of subjects responded to high-density treatment while 15% responded to
  low-density treatment (chi 2 = 5.00, df = 1, p = 0.025). There were no side
  effects attributable to the treatment, and all subjects who responded showed
  subsequent relapse during withdrawal. Treatment with a high-density
  negative ionizer appears to act as a specific antidepressant
  for patients with seasonal affective disorder. The method may be useful as an
  alternative or supplement to light therapy and medications.

Title
<br>
  Trial of a negative ion generator device in remediating
  problems related to indoor air quality.

Abstract
<br>
  It has been suggested that supplementation of indoor air with
  negative ions can improve air quality. This
  study examined the effects of a "negative ion-generator"
  device on air contaminants and symptom reporting in two office buildings.
  Separate sets of functional and nonfunctional negative ion
  generators were monitored using a double blind, crossover design involving
  two 5-week exposure periods. There were no detectable direct or residual
  effects of negative ion generator use on air ion levels,
  airborn particulates, carbon dioxide levels, or symptom reporting. Symptom
  reporting declined at both sites initially and appeared to be consistent with
  placebo effect. Job dissatisfaction was an apparent contributor to symptom
  reporting, with a magnitude comparable to presumed effects of air quality.
  Further testing of such devices is needed before they should be considered
  for office air quality problems.
