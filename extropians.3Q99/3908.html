<i>&gt;  </i><br>

<a name="3926qlink1">I don't think the concept of an enclave is outdated for a number</a> of reasons.  
<a name="3926qlink2">First, I think there's at least some possibility that people intent on 
implementing the transhumanist agenda may at some point have to establish 
some sort of territorially-based "political" entity to provide a legal 
environment in which to carry on their work.  Second, as satisfying as 
increasingly high-bandwidth VR communication will be, we'll still carry our 
primate genetic heritage for some time, and that means we'll want to share 
physical space for social interaction.  Third, some of the more innovative 
ideas for social experimentation we've discussed just won't work</a> if embedded 
<a name="3926qlink3">in traditional social matrices.  Finally, I think some set of folks</a> who call 
<a name="3926qlink4">themselves "extropian" will engage in extraterrestrial "colonization"</a> within 
<a name="3926qlink5">the next 100 years and this means an "enclave", at least at first.</a>
