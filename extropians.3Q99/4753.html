I have been following this thread with interest -- good points are being 
raised. 

<p>
I sense something almost touched upon, but not quite raising it's head. I 
hope it is not an intrusion to comment on the following post.  (Since I have 
taken his words out of context, I have included the whole post at the 
bottom.) Two sentences caught my eye.

<p>
Robin: ( snip - see whole post below) 

<p>
    &gt;&gt;For education, one can get a long way with a one-dimensional
    model: we all vary in our one-dimensional "ability," and education helps
    us signal that ability, and sometimes helps us to raise it.

<p>
[snip again see below for context]
<p>
    &gt;&gt; In art, multiple dimensions seem more salient.  There seem to be many
    things people are trying to signal, and these signals interact in more
    complex ways.

<p>
This is exactly the point of art's role and art's teachings, and what we are 
trying to say when we allude to why those of you science, programming and 
math communities could be more open and educated in some varying art fields. 
<a name="4968qlink1">And why art could be a core subject in school, equal with math, literature 
</a>and science.<a name="4968qlink2"> It is not fluff or dessert, but a serious training of neural 
networks to behave in a flexible, more complex and nonlinear pattern (the  
most famous well-known example is "Mozart for Math").</a>

<p>
I was pleasantly introduced to the following study on "Cognitive Flexibility" 
while working with an art historian who uses his techniques for training Art 
History to 
<br>
non-artists.

<p>
The study was actually done for med school, beacuse several medical students 
who had followed a "one-dimensional model" of compartmentalized studies of 
the brain, the heart, the circulatory system, etc., who received high marks 
on tests and classroom participation, were unable to put it together in 
*context*, and did not perform well in an actual situation (surgery, 
diagnostics,  or whatever). 

<p>
This is a hypertext model for learning how to learn "non-linearly.' 
It is how artists and musicians think anyway, and it may interest some.

<p>

 I agree there is an analogy, but there are also some differences worth
 pursuing.  For education, one can get a long way with a one-dimensional
 model: we all vary in our one-dimensional "ability", and education helps
 us signal that ability, and sometimes helps us to raise it.  The fact that
 you went to a good school and took hard subjects counts more that what
 school and what subject.
 
<p>
 In art, multiple dimensions seem more salient.  There seem to be many
 things people are trying to signal, and these signals interact in more
 complex ways.  In some ways people seem to signal raw artistic ability,
 the sort of ability that doesn't change much with time or context.
 And in other ways people seem to be signaling their wealth and free
 time.  Rapid changes in art also suggest to me that people are signaling
 the quality of their social information, showing that they find out
 before others what's going to be "hot."  And different communities have
 different ideas of "hot," suggesting that people are also trying to
 signal allegiance to various groups.  But what exactly determines the
 group that one feels allied to, I have little idea.  It all seems
 very complex, and so very interesting.
