Absolutely amazing.  The most politically conservative, policy-oriented
news show goes primetime and devotes an entire hour to transhumanist and
posthumanist future scenarios.  Outstanding performances by Kurzweiler and
Hiller, I might add.  The mainstream television media has just caught up to
the Wired press.

<p>
This is the opportunity that I thought would take at least another year to
happen.  Now is the time for transhumanists to approach mainstream media
outlets and pitch stories, op-ed pieces and interviews.  Because these
other media outlets will be following the lead of Nightline and looking for
futurist/computer stories.  Or, you could mention that Nightline did this
story and would they like something similar?  If you get to them early, you
will get into their rolodexes first.  But do it soon!
