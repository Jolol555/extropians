If while</a> you were contemplating a slight restriction in your left aorta
or replaying the time you lost your virginity, a lion decided to
have you for lunch, that extra information would be a survival
disadvantage.

Now that we are almost in the trans-survival era, this information may
be of interest to us.  For example, it would be great to have dynamic
feedback on the cell division rate in your body -- one level is
normal, a higher level indicates possible cancer developing.

<p>

Nanomedicine discusses the data management requirements fairly extensively.
They are huge.  Some of the first people who are going to have to
learn to drink from the tidal wave are the physicians who are going
to have to deal with the data reports on your 30+ trillion cells.
