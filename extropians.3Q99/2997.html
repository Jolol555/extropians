Too late.  Its heeere!  You have 40 trillion self-replicating nanites
crawling around inside you right now....  And they are much worse
than the systems suggested by Drexler et. al. because they can't
even copy their operating program correctly!

Seriously Eliezer, could you explain a bit more what it is you are
afraid of --
<pre>
  (a) self-replicating machines;
  (b) our ability to program such machines;
  (c) the advanced materials properties allowed by hard-nanotech;
  (d) every [sane] person being able to do (b) on (a) constructed from (c);
  (e) the dangers that result from (d) including not-quite-so-sane people;
  (f) the risks posed by allowing nanomachinery to "evolve";
</a>
  (g) something I've missed?

</pre>
<p>
<a name="3049qlink1">If it is (b) on (a), I think in the biotech industry will achieve it
in the next 3-5 years.  [I may even start the company to do it... :-)]
