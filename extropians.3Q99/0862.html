Again, I find myself coming to the defense of another person by the verbal assaults
of another "in" person on this list, who probably feels it his 'moral' duty to be such
an a**h**l for the sake of protecting the hive mentality from 'dangerous' memes!
Ahh, what is a fragile extropian to do!  Help me Mark!  Help me Lee!  I'm hearing
memes that are not part of the consensus materialistic dogma that is our religion!

P.S. Sick again (for the umpteenth time) of the dogmatic close-minded crap that poses itself as "cool, and roguishing skeptical extropianian thought'.
