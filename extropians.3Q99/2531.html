A corporation might spend anything from 0% to 70%+ on R&amp;D.
If you are a law firm it is probably close to 0; most "R"
you do gets billed directly to the customer so the customer
is really funding the "R", little "D" required unless you
are changing over to a paperless office.  On the other end
of the spectrum, a startup in a hightech industry spends
almost all of its money on R&amp;D.  Hitech/rapid change industries
(computers, biotech, etc.) must do a lot of R&amp;D to remain competitive.
Low tech (food, most disposable goods, etc.) spend more of their
money on marketing to remain competitive.

If you want the figures for the U.S. I think the government
overall has a $70-90 billion dollar research budget.  Much
of that does in fact trickle down to the University level.
For example Nat. Inst. of Health is up to around $15 billion/yr
and almost all of that ends up at the Universities.  If you
take the semiconductor industry (worldwide), it has revenues
around $230 billion, spending an average of 13% of revenues
on R&amp;D (~$30B).  I think the Pharmaceutical industry may be
a little larger or has a higher R&amp;D percentage because they
are perhaps at $20-$25 B/yr on R&amp;D.
