Now chess players have come to realize that their brains are running
an algorithm of some kind; perhaps not well understood, but still
an algorithm.  Today chess players in general will tend to be very
comfortable with the notion that computers will eventually [probably

such as driving cars, recognizing a face in a crowd, developing software,
writing poetry and music, and even playing chess *and enjoying</a> it*.

It was precisely this point that made me ask the original question regarding
Deep Blue. 20 years ago, a lot of people (including it appears, some in the
AI community) thought that playing chess at grandmaster level was something
that required a 'higher level of thinking', something more than could be
achieved through brute force.  Deep Blue resolved that question. Today many
people suggest that computers can never achieve "consciousness" or
<br>
"sentience". Perhaps in another 20 years we will know the answer to that<br>
question.
