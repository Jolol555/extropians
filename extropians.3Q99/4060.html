Abstract
<br>
  Atherosclerosis and its sequelae of MI, bypass surgery, and
  angioplasty can be affected positively in both the primary
  and secondary setting by the use of properly prescribed
  physical activity. Such activity in a higher weekly kilocalorie expenditure
  (usually involving greater intensity) seems to be effective
  in achieving regression of atherosclerosis and in improving
  LVEF. In general, any activity is better than none, but more energy
  expenditure seems associated with greater benefits. Regardless of
  these apparent beneficial effects of
<br>
  exercise, such benefits are much less apparent if modification of
  other coronary risk factors is not also achieved.
  These efforts must focus on cessation of smoking, control of
  abnormal blood lipids, and normalization of high blood pressure. With
  these less costly methods of controlling
  atherosclerosis, the future impact of this
  type of intervention will likely be of great importance as society adjusts to
  the cost constraints of managed (especially capitated) care
  in the near future. [References: 42]
