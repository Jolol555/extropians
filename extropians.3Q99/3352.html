There is a critical difference between atomic-tech/space-tech
and biotech/nanotech.  The first generally requires large scales
while the second can work at very small scales.

It is hard to hide uranium mining &amp; radioactive material
separation or concentrations.  Rocket launchers &amp; rockets
generally have to have certain minimum sizes to be useful.
These things cost money and are fairly observable.

<p>
With biotech &amp; nanotech, the quantity of materials, the physical
space needed to manipulate them and the costs are on declining
curves with time.  So the development of "basement" operations
seems highly probable.  I'm unsure whether you could make up
a list of "items for restricted sale" in the case of biotech
or nanotech.  I suspect it would be an ever increasing list
as the technologies of AFMs, MEMS, supra-molecular chemistry,
etc. advanced.
