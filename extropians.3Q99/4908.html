<i> &gt;  It is a general effort to move class action law suits from state</i><br>

<i> &gt;         { the rationale being that moving cases from the state courts to the</i><br>

<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt;  The bill was gnerally supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats.</i><br>

<p>
While I rarely find myself on the same side of a political issue as my own
congressperson (Jackson-Lee, quoted above), and I haven't looked at this bill
that closely, I've become generally against increasing restrictions on
private civil actions such as the one proposed.

<p>
I was a strong proponent of the general "tort reform" movement throughout the
1990s, because from the 60s through the 80s leftist state legislatures and
states with elected judiciaries had basically allowed tort law to turn into
an anti-enterprise lottery run by a small handful of plaintiffs' lawyers.
But (with a few notable exceptions - DON'T try to do business in Mississippi
or Alabama or South Texas), tort reform legislation and media campaigns have
basically cleaned up the tort system.  Now, the momentum of tort reform is
being used by a relatively small number of large corporations (my usual
clientele, I might add) to undermine the traditional private law enforcement
function of the tort common law.

<p>
Honest and ethical plaintiffs' lawyers - when necessary using the mechanism
of class actions - serve a valuable function in a free society: They police
the behavior of large institutions (including large businesses) with that
most powerful and reliable of incentives, the profit motive.  Businesses that
run to the legislature for protection from the tort system every time the
going gets hot at the courthouse are doing no one a favor, because by doing
so, they erode a basic liberty upon which liberal society is premised: The
freedom to sue the bastards!
