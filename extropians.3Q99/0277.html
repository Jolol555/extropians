Well, here we go with normative-theoretic basics:  Who's the actual 
sponsor/owner of this chat/mail list.  Who-so-ever-the-hell it is, don't 
THEY have the (moral, and de facto) RIGHT to censor, desubscribe, or 
whatever?  Presumably, most of us are, ultimately, *guests* of the said 
sponsor/owner (again, regardless of who the hell said sponsor/owner happens 
to be [EXI, Max More personally, or a secret cabal consisting of FM2020, 
RAW, &amp; Ignatz the Anarchist Mouse]).  Can a sponsor/owner kick a guest out, 
more-or-less "arbitrarily?"  Well, sure.  S/He might not "ought" to do so, 
it may be SUBerogatory for hir to do so, but S/He rightfully CAN do 
so---it's permissible in the important sense that it is correlatively 
IMpermissible for anyone else to coercively interfere with hir doing so.  Or 
am I TOTALLY screwed-up here?

<p>
Sure, we are--and damn well should be--a COMMUNITY, indeed, perhaps almost 
like a family, but let's not forget that someone or some organization is the 
proprietor, who ultimately has say-so.

<p>
I like dialog...dialectic.  I think you, Joe, and Mike and Mark and Brian, 
and Billy, et al were doin' FINE; we were, at least to SOME extent, honing 
in on a (at least partial) reconciliation of the opposing sides (not 
counting and notwithstanding the personal invective, [alleged] lies, 
<br>
[alleged] personal defamations etc.--I'm talkin' about the evolution of the <br>
debated concepts, ideas, protocols, etc.)  I think we really do need such 
systematic dialog/dialectic (WITHfrickinOUT personal invective b.s.)....

<p>
*BUT* I also feel(felt) that the g-word megathread(s) WERE spiralling into 
as much apolectic invective bullcrap as effective, productive dialectic, and 
many (apparently most) of the rest of the--ah-hem--COMMUNITY felt likewise.  
So they appealled to Greg to (temporarily) quash it.  Was I disappointed?  
Well, yeah, a teeeeny bit, because I thought (still think) the main 
protagonists were--nonetheless!!--maikin some good philosophic 
(intersubjective, dialectical, reflective-equilibrating) PROfrickinGRESS.

<p>
But Greg chose to act in his capacity, and......

<p>
Anyway, Joe, Mike, et al whaddaya think??  Am right here, full o' crap here 
or what??

<p>
I always love your stuff, Joe.  Be cool, bro.

<p>
Ciao
