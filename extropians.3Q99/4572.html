My personal take is that we are in the bread and circuses stage of our
civilization's development, that the wrestling on TV, the violent
movies, and the urban crime are consistent with the feeding christians
to lions stage that Rome went through. It can't be helped. Man is a wild
animal and must vent his need to hunt and prowl in a wilderness setting
or he will take it out on his fellow man. This is statistically
supported by studies that have shown that active<a name="4601qlink2"> hunters have the lowest
incidence of criminal behavior of any segment of the population.</a> Quite
<a name="4576qlink1">the opposite of the Deliverance image that Hollywood likes to paint of
the hunting culture.</a>
