Subject: Sunshine Needed!


<p>
I have been asked to forward the following important information.

<p>
Jack

<p>
ACTION  ALERT -- Immediate Action Needed
<p>
   Comments must be filed by Friday September 10th.

</a>
<p>
Most of you are already familiar with the controversy over public
access to federally-funded research data. In a nutshell, Senator
Richard Shelby (R-AL) inserted a two-sentence requirement into P.L.
105-277 last fall that permits public access to federally-funded
research data under FOIA guidelines.

<p>
Eagle Forum supported the Senator Shelby requirement, and
submitted comments earlier this year when the OMB issued its
initial proposed regulations. Sunshine is a disinfectant, and public
access to such data minimizes corruption, mistakes, and fraud
concerning such data.

<p>
For example, the tragedy of the rotavirus vaccine would never have
happened if the public had access to the data used by the FDA and
CDC in recommending the vaccine. I have been studying the reports
and have concluded that the FDA and CDC ignored and concealed
data that showed the problems from the outset.

<p>
The Shelby Amendment, if properly implemented, would ensure that
federally-financed research about vaccines could not be withheld from
the public. Ultimately this rule should be extended to all data on
which the government makes vaccine policy decisions, including
privately-funded research data as well. This would greatly improve the
integrity of vaccine policymaking.

<p>
Although 55% of the commenters to OMB indicated their support for
the Shelby amendment, OMB has now issued new proposed
regulations that would eviscerate the amendment, particularly with
respect to vaccine data. We only have until September 10th to
submit comments as text (not an attachment) in an e-mail to F.
James Charney, Policy Analyst, OMB, Re: OMB Circular A-110, at
grants@omb.eop.gov.

<p>
This recent proposal by OMB would effectively remove all
federally-funded vaccine research from public access. It does this by
only allowing public access for data "used by the Federal
Government in developing a regulation" pursuant to formal rulemaking
proceedings. The CDC vaccine recommendations would not qualify,
although they would have qualified under the broader rule proposed
by OMB earlier this year.

<p>

<p>
We need as many people commenting as possible! Time is of
the essence. Please write to: F. James Charney, Policy Analyst, OMB,
(grants@omb.eop.gov) and insist he implement the Shelby Amendment as
intended! Make certain to cite OMB Circular A-110.</a>
