<a name="3384qlink1">Assuming that you take yourself to be "intelligent", how do you know that
you know that you know and that you're not just a pre-programmed system which
has been programmed to claim that it knows that it knows? I'm not being
facetious here, I'm perfectly serious: most arguments against AI start by
claiming that humans have wonderful facilities which computers don't, when
they have absolutely no proof.</a>

<p>
Can you prove that you can do all those things you're claiming that the
computer can't do? If not, why should I accept this argument?
