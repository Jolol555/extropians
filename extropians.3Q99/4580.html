After sending that earlier message it occured to me that unitelnw.com is
probably the URL for the company.  Sure enough, they have some very,
well, interesting material there.

The QC is small potatoes for these guys.  Need a faster than light space
drive that will use quantum tunneling and zero point energy to travel
all over the universe?  They've got one.  Step right up.

<p>
They also have an NMR type device that can eliminate any disease organism
throughout the body without harming tissues, by hitting its unique
resonant frequency.

<p>
You can always hope that somebody offering an amazing new technology
really has the goods.  But unfortunately the odds are strongly against it.
