Here in the US, we commonly use two measuring systems - metric and
'English' (inches and ounces, etc.).  I used to be annoyed by the failure
to settle on one system (preferably metric), but I have since decided to
stop worrying about it.  I realize that I can convert a measurement in
one system to the other using a calculator, and let it go at that.


<p>
The inconsistencies are mostly rooted in the historical development of
physics.  When people call something by a particular name for years, it's
hard to change.  Back in the 1960s there was a big worldwide push to
replace 'cycles per second' with 'hertz'.  Now, years later, that has
finally been successful.  But I think it is in large part because many
people who used to say 'cycles per second' have simply died, and been
replaced by others who were taught to say 'hertz'.


<p>
<a name="0773qlink1">Every so often, physics tries to purge itself of inconsistency. 
Historical electromagnetic units, for example, come in several systems
which are unbelievably convoluted and confusing and which make the whole
subject difficult to understand.  Some years ago, the 'International
System of units' was devised.  It is called SI after its French initials.
<a name="0807qlink1"> In the 1980s, the meter was redefined in terms of the speed of light,
whereas earlier it had been defined as a certain number of wavelengths of
a certain spectral line of Krypton 86.  The meter is now defined as the
distance light travels in 1/299,792,458 second.</a>  That means we no longer
have to wonder what is the exact<a name="0807qlink2"> speed of light.  It is 299,792,458
meters per second, exactly, by definition.</a></a>
