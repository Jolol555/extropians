As Xerxes stated, the list archives do not cover this period.  I've yet
to see any analysis of the Code, regulations, Service guidance, judicial 
rulings or constitutional law advocating or asserting that the federal
income tax is "optional" or "unconstitutional" or whatever that can 
withstand informed criticism.

<p>
Please send me this "lengthy analysis".  If you are correct, my Firm has
clients that spend billions of dollars a year to "reduce" their effective
tax rate.  I'm sure they'll be interested in your ability to eliminate
their tax burden totally.
