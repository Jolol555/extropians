<a name="3528qlink1">Because it's not hard to imagine scenarios with advanced nanotech in which 
one or more Bad Crazies destroy the planet, I share the fairly common fears 
associated with it.  However, a point that a couple of experienced defense 
professionals shared with me earlier this year is the fact that there are 
astonishingly few examples of the kind of mass havoc that Bad Crazies could 
be wreaking now with existing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs).  Consider 
the old 1960s scenario of "Charles Manson putting acid in LA's water supply" 
or similar biochemical attacks.  The Om Yo Ricio attacks in Japan are the 
only example of a terrorist chemical incident of which I'm aware.  Likewise, 
<a name="3534qlink1">with the dissolution of the old Soviet Union, it seems like a seriously 
committed band of well-financed terrorists ought by now to have been able to 
have gotten a small nuke to use for terrorist purposes.

<p>
<a name="3500qlink1">State terrorism has also been surprisingly limited.  Saddam Hussein</a> COULD 
have used chemical or biological warheads in his SCUDs, but didn't.</a>  Hitler 
<a name="3500qlink2">could have, but didn't use biological or chemical weapons</a> on the battlefield. 
 Why?

<p>
<a name="3528qlink2"><a name="3500qlink3">I don't propose to have an answer for these questions, but they do</a> point to 
<a name="3500qlink4">some limiting factors that curtail the frequency with which WMDs are used.</a>  
<a name="3500qlink5">Of course, the problem with advanced nanotech is that it presumably lowers 
the threshold for an isolated Bad Crazy to build a WMD.  If it only increases 
the danger by a factor of ten, the effect could be devastating.</a>
