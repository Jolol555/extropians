<p>
This and the suggestion of refining emotions (so that, by analogy, you get a 
specific warning message instead of "General Protection Fault" :-) sound 
really useful to me.

<p>
Meditation, again, is useful for the former. I haven't been doing it much 
lately, but when it was a regular habit, I had the experience several times 
of sitting down to meditate when I was emotionally stirred up. Eventually, I 
would get to a place where I had a calm, still perspective, but could still 
see my stirred-up "stuff." It would be as if, instead of having the stuff 
inside my body-mind, I was holding it on my lap. Once you've done this, by 
whatever method, it becomes possible to do it at will, at least until 
something comes along to kick you into an even deeper morass of emotions.

<p>
Actually, there are two general flavors of meditation: stillness and insight. 
I am talking above about the effect of stillness, and insight "should" be 
helpful in the refining process. but I suspect it really only gets us to the 
point of correctly identifying the source of whatever emotion is "up" at the 
time, rather than necessarily developing more acute ones at a low level.

<p>
I'd love to know about working shortcuts here, since for most people, enough 
meditation practice to be useful for this amounts to years.

<p>
Some formulas I have encountered and partially tested are:


<UL>
  <li>  All fear comes from a threat to the ego;
  <li>  Anger is derivative of fear;
  <li>  Depression is the result of repressed fear (this may well not be the only 
source of depression, or perhaps some cases are just very subtle and 
indirect).

Anders again, different post:
<br>
<a href="0122.html#0159qlink2">&gt; (Hmm, what are the proper english words for these two states? In Swedish it</a><br>
<i>&gt; is likely "avund" and "missunsamhet" - trust the Swedes to have subtle</i><br>
<i>&gt; nuances for envy :-) </i><br>
I think the main english word for "missunsamhet" is "covetousness," from "to 
covet" as in "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife's ass."

I have a simple example germane to the parenthetical above. "To be able to 
play chess is a sign of a fine mind. To be able to play it well is a sign of 
a misspent youth." There were no human-strength chess computers during my 
misspent youth, but as they became available and I played against them, I 
noticed that I would lose more games than I "should" to them (when I was 
doing a lot of this, I was at USCF 2000 strength, +/- 50 points, and the 
<a name="0182qlink1">highest ratings claimed by commercial computers were around 2100).</a>

<p>
Introspection provided a compelling answer: I wasn't treating the process of 
playing chess with a computer as a real game. The reason? *The computer 
didn't give a damn whether it won or lost.* I see a chess game as a contest 
between two sentients; me sitting at my PC moving pieces on a virtual board 
connected to, say, gnuchess, _looks_ like a game of chess, but doesn't have 
any contest aspect. I can use exactly the same interface to connect to a 
chess server and play a human; in that case, there is a contest, we both 
"care" about the outcome (or agree to for the moment) and indeed, I play up 
to my (declining) abilities in that case.

<p>
It seems like even Kasparov had trouble taking Deep Blue seriously at first, 
but he learned quickly. He, of course, was playing publicly and had the 
computer's developers very much in the game, and besides, he has a bigger ego 
than I do :-)

<p>
My example addresses roughly half of Greg's comment, actually. I would say 
that the lack of expressions of emotion would be one way an AI could fail a 
Turing test, just as it makes gnuchess fail my chess-opponent Turing test 
(gnuchess doesn't talk back at all, so it's clearly not trying to pass the 
test); and OTOH, giving the AI some basic drives and a sense of self may well 
be necessary for it to be able to formulate its own goals and act on them 
(nothing new here, really).
