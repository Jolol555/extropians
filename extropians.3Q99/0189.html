<a name="0218qlink1"><a href="0178.html#0189qlink1">&gt; Here's a shortlist of candidate "extropian" tunes:</a><br>
<i>&gt; The "Blade Runner" soundtrack by Vangelis</i><br>
<i>&gt; Almost any other record by Vangelis.  Try "Albedo 0.39" or "Direct."</i><br>
<i>&gt; The "2001" soundtrack.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Practically anything by David Bowie.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Brian Eno's "Ambient 1: Music for Airports."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Continue down this path, and the criteria for membership to the tribe
"Extropians" will become loving 2001, owning the "I'm an Extropian, whatever
the hell that means" T-shirt and knowing all 258 verses of the Extropian
anthem.</a>
<br>
Is it really necessary to forge a primal social interface for the
Extropians? If you do, then meeting these criteria will be paramount to
membership, with the original principles coming second. Do you want the
membership of tribal zealots? Do you want the concept of "membership" at
all? The principles are "Extropian", not the people who identify with them.
<a name="0195qlink1">I realise that this message wil probably not get far, due to my likely
presence on your "kill-files"</a> (incidentally - self-censorship, very clever)
for being not nearly ostentatious enough in my use of language, or
programmed enough in my worldview.

<p>
Does this make sense to anyone? Is there a killfile I'm not on? Come on,
boys and girls, there's got to be someone else out there that doesn't get
horny speculating the composition of some technology which'll probably never
happen. Real discussion about reality anyone?
