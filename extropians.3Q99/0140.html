Crank! Occultist! Heretic! Supersti......sorry, force of habit. :)

<p>
This is a definite possibillity, and unfortunatly, as far as I'm aware, not
one that have been mentioned in any book on the subject. (UFO's, that is,
not nanotech.)</a>

<p>
<a href="0137.html#0140qlink4">&gt;Also, most of the saucers sighted by witnesses are sleek and seamless.  </a><br>

<a name="0142qlink4"><i>&gt;Maybe the so-called alien presence is some form of projection showing us </i><br>

<p>
*whimsical speculation mode on*

<p>
One 'transhuman possibillity', put forward by John Keel and others, are
that we are being not-so-subtly tested/influenced by a Power. Perhaps the
Singularity has already occured and we're the descendants of the neophobes
who refused to take part.....</a>
