I am a machine, an extropian automaton, that feeds on knowledge.  Bring your
books to me and I will devour them!

<i>&gt; Deepness in the Sky_ and Neal Stephenson's _Cryptonomicon_.</i><br>

<p>
I've managed to find _Cryptonomicon_ at a UK on-line bookstore and ordered
it today.  For some reason Amazon UK have got it set for release in
November, the same day it goes paperback.

<p>
Interestingly Amazon UK (www.amazon.co.uk) also carry the following:

<p>
<i>&gt; UNTITLED NOVEL 1</i><br>
<i>&gt; NEAL STEPHENSON Our Price: £12.99</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Paperback - 926 pages ( 7 September, 2000)</i><br>
<i>&gt; Heinemann; ISBN: 0434008931</i><br>

<p>
I take it this is the sequel to Cryptonomicon.  For some reason Amazon UK
list all the unpublished books.  (This can be a useful resource, although I
now know of books I want that aren't released for another year or two).

<p>
<a href="2046.html#2317qlink2">&gt; As for facts, I would suggest Gazzaniga's *huge* _The Cognitive</a><br>
<i>&gt; Neurosciences_ if you are so inclined after reading Austin</i><br>

<p>
Further reading in the neurosciences is certain...

<p>
I notice that MIT Press have _The New Cognitive Neurosciences_ forthcoming
in November:

<p>
<a href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/book-home.tcl?isbn=0262071959">http://mitpress.mit.edu/book-home.tcl?isbn=0262071959</a>

<p>
Unfortunately both are out of my current price range (which, in reality, is
zero, but I think I can get away with a few purchases).

<p>
Since I'm feeling off-topic, and I don't want to compose a new message, I
recently had the following thought...

<p>
"I don't give a damn about the sick, people are dying here!"

<p>
This, I think, should be the rallying cry for immortalists.  Along with...

<p>
"Age related illnesses have a 100% mortality rate."

<p>
Thanks to all those who made suggestions,

<p>
BM
