<a href="4526.html#4534qlink1">&gt;Overall, the theme of the 90s seems to have been retro. </a><br>

<p>
This could be because what we were paying attention to in the 80's was too avante to have gone mainstream until the 90's.  I've been noticing that myself.  At the 80's parties, notice that the people wearing the clothing and doing their hair in a mohawk often were part of the crowd that *made fun* of that style in the actual 80's!  And now they enjoy it.

<i>&gt;As we pass the millennium there is a real chance to see people start &gt;exploring new stuff rather than rehashing the last decades. Any ideas &gt;of what this new stuff could look like?</i><br>

<p>
I'm wondering that myself, because trends on the alternative scene are starting to wind down.  People have run out of body parts to pierce or tattoo, and clothing made from industrial materials is nothing new.  Electronic music has pulled in sampling from every existing genre.  Some fashion designers, particularly in Tokyo, are doing clothing that changes the human shape into something geometric, but it hasn't seemed to gotten off the runway yet.  I'd personally like to see that take off, because we have already had several centuries of the same basic human body form.
