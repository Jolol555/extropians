An interesting post. However...

Sorry, but *commonly* the word 'frozen" is used to denote a liquid system
which has either *partially* or totally undergone phase transition. Such as
"frozen ice cream treat" or "frozen Dendroides canadensis". Even *more*
commonly, it is used to denote a system that has ceased it's regular
movement - such as "frozen gears" or a "freeze play video".

chastising us for our venacular use of language, why don't you educate us
as to what is happening in the body of that fish and those flies, and what
it suggests for the future of human cryonics. After all, most people here
