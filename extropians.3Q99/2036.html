<p>
Huh?

<p>
A state-sponsored education can either be constructed to promote
uniformity or promote diversity.  Most importantly, it can be
constructed to promote "belief in existing memes" or "critical
thinking".  Whether the state is involved or not, the critical
factor is what is being "sponsored" or "taught".

<p>
I question this whole "Americanisation of creationism" perspective!
I had a long conversation over Microsoft NetMeeting with a couple
of "Christians" from New Zealand a few weeks ago.  It isn't
"where" you are from, but how much you have been brainwashed
that counts.

Not true.  Indviduals who are open-minded could certainly
teach "critical thinking" followed  by a variety of examples
from various religious/non-religious perspectives.  The essential
component is transfering "belief/faith" into the "subject to
critical review" realm.

<p>
&gt; If you refuse to allow people to determine their own individual<br>
<a href="2030.html#2036qlink3">&gt; curricula, then fights like these are inevitable at the margins.</a><br>

<p>
It depends entirely on the individual.  I, for one could present
a very balanced perspective to students in a variety of areas.
I would argue for very critical thinking.  I would presume that
Max would be the best individual to comment on this topic since
he has had to teach these subjects and deal with the underlying
belief systems.
