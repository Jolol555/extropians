Re: planet sized supercomputers

<a href="2051.html#2071qlink2">&gt; The only reason I can think of would be that they don't care - you</a><br>
<i>&gt; build computing structures out of all the available matter, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; energy requirements tturn out to be less than the entire stellar</i><br>

<i>&gt; content/production in the entire system.</i><br>

<p>
These are two different things.  As J/M-Brains age, they presumably
accumulate more "memory" and would need to grow their storage
structures.  In contrast their information production is going to
require energy.  So you have to come up with a model where they
don't want to maximize information production or are throwing away
their memories.  [Perhaps they are very enlightened... :-)]

<p>
As a general comment, I've tried to make all my M-Brain stuff depend
on technologies that we have or will soon have.  [E.g. we could start
building a M-Brain today and as it evolves it could replace Pentiums
with nanocomputers.]  I believe that in your original paper and some work
that Robert Freitas has done, information storage goes down to the
Bekenstein/Bremermann bounds.  Those bounds are *quite* a bit below
what I can envision actually constructing.  I chose circulating photons
for the M-Brain storage giving you something like 10^15 - 10^27 Terabytes.
This requires energy for "regeneration", but it isn't much of the power
budget.  There are other memory materials you could envision -- atoms
in a 3D lattice, electron spin states on those atoms, nuclear spin
states, etc. but it seemed to me circulating photons require the least
material and have the interesting property that they can go through
each other to some degree (though I don't take advantage of that in
my designs).

Re: things to do as an SI

<a href="2051.html#2071qlink3">&gt; Hurray! Hmm, maybe we should as posthumans just rearrange the solar</a><br>
<i>&gt; system to "improve" on astrology? :-)</i><br>

<p>
I'd vote for having astrology *really* work for those people who
*really* beleive in it (in the upload virtual reality).  I think
we may be able to take advantage of that fact for our own amusement.
