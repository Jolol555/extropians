<a href="4361.html#4376qlink1">&gt; In view of Lee Daniel's pronouncements on the irrationality</a><br>
<i>&gt; of feminism, I suppose the following question is in order:</i><br>
<i>&gt; How is feminism irrational?</i><br>

<p>
If I had said such a stupid thing, I should certainly be taken
to task for it, but I think most of us on the list have sufficient
reading comprehension skills to know that I did not.  What I said,
and stand behind, is that complete 100% dogmatic egalitarianism--
the idea that men and women are completely equal in every respect
and should treated equally in every case--is just as stupid and
irrational as our society's historic subjugation of women.  The
example of statutory rape laws was a case in point--there /should/
be a double standard there, just as there /should/ be a double
standard in reproductive choice: a mother has the right to choose
to carry a child or not; the father does not have that choice, and
I don't believe he should, because the reality is that the choice
affects the mother far more than it does him.

<p>
I am not blind that women have suffered horribly throughout history,
and I am delighted that those wrongs are starting to be redressed.
I am also not blind to the fact that they still suffer from
perceptions and policies that try to keep them subjugated.  I have
fought many of those policies, even to the point of using genderneutral
 pronouns.  My father was a military pilot in Vietnam, so I
grew up mostly with my mother and older sister.  I gained a great
deal of respect for strong, bright, capable women and the injustices
they had to suffer to succeed.  I would not for a moment suggest
that the feminist movement as a whole was anything but positive.
But by the same token, I should be able to say, for example, that
Andrea Dworkin a certifiably insane man-hater without implying that
I have anything against more enlightened women struggling for their
freedom. 

<p>
I do not apologize for valuing facts more than motives.
