I think there are two different but linked feedback loops involved
here. The O2 partial pressure is limited by flammability- above 23%,
even green wood burns enthusiastically, so the oxygen level won't
rise higher, instead, more biomass will get oxidized.  There is a
*lot* of carbon available for this equilibrium, peat bogs and
tropical forests should suffice.

<p>
The second loop is the CO2 temperature feedback- warmer climate
encourages more coral reefbuilding which sequesters CO2 in carbonate
reefs.  IIRC, there are other temperature feedback mechanisms that
would remove the CO2.

<p>
Where these two run into trouble is the increasing luminosity of the
sun, which is driving CO2 toward zero.  C4 plants arose relatively
recently in response to the stress of lower CO2, and when this
crucial component goes too low in about 200 million years, *that*
could be a problem.

<p>
Since the next few decades are the real issue, all the above is only
of scientific interest...
