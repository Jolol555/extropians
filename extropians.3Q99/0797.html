Well, after some *really profound* retrofitting, perhaps, such as taking off
the wings.  And wheels.  And redesigning the rest of it to be lighter and
carry more fuel.  Better yet, keep the solids and the external tank, and
start all over on the design of the orbitter, use it as a never-return vehicle.
Or, consider Bob Zubrin's notion of a shuttle Z and an Ares, mentioned
on page 62 of his book The Case for Mars.  After I did the numbers on
his space trucks, they look like a really good bet for what you propose.
