Here's a repost of 7/1/99 -Sleep Tools

<p>
I've learned a few tools to enable sleep. ( Had to, working long overnight
hours in various hospital settings, like I did.)
They all have their advantages and disadvantages. Here are a few.
(1) Melatonin:
<p>
     (A) fast acting, cheap, low dosage- I found that 3/4 mg would knock me
out for a good 4 hours, PREVENTS COLDSprior
<p>
       to using melatonin, I had 2-3 SEVERE colds each year, since I
discovered this effect several years ago I have been
<p>
      100% cold free. Using myself as a guinea pig, I determined that a
single 1 mg dose every 3-4 days is probably sufficient    FOR ME , to never
have another cold. I do use a fairly high level of supplements and am very
active regular runner and I don't smoke, so adjust your dose if your immune
system is not what it should be.
<p>
     (D) long 1/2 life in the body-you'll stay groggy longer, but if you
have
<br>
to sleep in a noisy environment ( barracks, dorm or have young kids) and do
get awakened you'll quickly return to sleep, IMPORTANT-if you have high
blood
<br>
pressure you might want to take it easy with this stuff, melatonin has been
shown to constrict the vessels in the Circle of Willis ( main arterial
vessels in the brain ) over use or high dosages might contribute to a CVA by
raising intracrainial BP, don't drive or operate heavy equipment
(2) Kava
<p>
     (A) fast acting, short 1/2 life- you wake up after a full night's sleep
clear headed, also cheap, the sensation produced by the herb is
pleasant.(400
<br>
mg works for me)
<p>
     (D) the sleep inducing effect is not as intense as melatonin even at
higher dosages &gt; 800 mg, consistency of effect across brand may differ since
herbal preparations vary a lot
<br>
(3) chamomile tea
<p>
     (A) short 1/2 life, cheap, effective symptomatic treatment for nausea
vomiting
<p>
     (D) tea has less than pleasant taste
(4) stimulation of seratonin production
<p>
     (A) anyone can do it- eat a plate of food high in both starch and
complete protein ( mashed potatoes heavy on the milk, pasta with meat sauce,
etc.) forces your brain- do to a quirk in amino acid metabolism- to over
produce seratonin which induces sleep
<p>
    (D) ya'll get fatter'n hogs, if ya do this too often
(5) calcium- magnesium tablets
<p>
     (A) both are essential nutrients, since both help with pain reliefcalcium
 can block pain and magnesium is a very effective muscle relaxant the
combo is good if pain is what's keeping you awake
<p>
     (D) slow acting, long 1/2 life- you will be groggy the next day if you
take too much
<br>
(6) Vitamin C/ exercise
<p>
    (A) both very good for you in many ways, cheap but use buffered C not
plain or chewable- long term use of high doses of C (2-5 gm/day) raises the
level of endorphins in the body to a level that is manageable( no
overwhelming sleepiness on the job ) and you tend to have a great attitudesustained
 exercise ( a good run, biking a few miles, some sustained
horizontal exercise) adds a load of new endorphins to the mix for a really
mystical experience before sleep comes
<br>
(7) hypnosis
<br>
 (A) nothin' cheeper, has other useful benes if you learn how- pain
reduction, hypermnesia(love this one when I'm cramming for an exam)
 (D) not fool proof- if you're distracted or in a hurry it may not work,
practice is essential may not keep you asleep all night
