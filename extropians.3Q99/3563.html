I know that others have made this comment, but I have to note that I found 
these two pieces singularly unconvincing.  The first fails utterly because it 
seems to completely misapprehend the role of law in libertarian thinking, 
especially by folks like Bruce Benson, Bruno Leoni and David Friedman.  The 
second attacks a straw man by conflating "freedom from coercion" with 
"freedom from social constraint".  The second piece does point out the 
theoretical dangers inherent in minarchism, but doesn't really undermine at 
all libertarianism as a set of social values, as opposed to a completely 
rigorous moral philosophy.
