Marvin said, "I'd don't care if it's directed at me, you are wasting *my* time, so please leave so someone with more intelligence can ask a real question."  Or words to that effect.

Hey, guys, we're trying to have a serious discussion here!  If you've
got nothing better to do than gossip about the personal habits of AI
researchers, then leave the thread and stop wasting our time!

But seriously, when you make a segue of that magnitude, please change
the subject line.  Or else try to maintain relevance to the topic; i.e.
"And I think this demonstrates a disdain for all human beings that is
the direct result of being an AI researcher, which is why I don't trust
an AI Transcend."
