<a name="2010qlink1">Seeing Dave's recent list of the EI lists and my recent encounters
with a few Seattle people at various ExI/Foresight conferences
leads me to the conclusion that we need an exi-northwest list.

<p>
Could people from the Seattle/Portland/Vancouver region send
me an email if they want to opt-in to such a list.  One of
the things that I would like to do is begin to organize
quarterly/bi-monthly/monthly (?) get togethers for idea
sharing, perhaps intimate discussions with authors, etc.
I'd also like to float a group project in putting together
course materials for discussions about Nanotech/Extropy.
One thing that was clear from the Bioastronomy conference
is the desire that science teachers have for ideas that
will inspire their students.  I think we have those
falling out of our brains in great excess.
