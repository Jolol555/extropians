<i>&gt; Extropians are capable of independent thought, you'll discover!)</i><br>

<p>
For the record, I came us with "ultrahuman" several months ago, while
thinking about my book and my talk for the conference. I was surprised and
amused to see your use of the term immediately before I first used the term
publically at the conference (though it had been on the conference program
for a while before that). This isn't really surprising though. Several
people have independently come up with "extropy" and "transhuman" (or
"trans-human").</a>

<p>
<a href="2087.html#2098qlink3">&gt;Those who would suggest that (1) is the right characterization would need to</a><br>
<i>&gt;argue that humanism actually does include technophobia. </i><br>

<p>
In general, humanists are quite technophilic. It's hard not to be when your
worldview revolves around valuing reason and science. Yet, many humanists
are far less technophilic than us, particularly when it comes to altering
ourselves in significant ways.

<p>
<a href="2087.html#2098qlink4">&gt;Looking over various posts to this list, I think there are many people here</a><br>
<i>&gt;would accurately be described as "post-humanists." I don't share their</i><br>
beliefs.

<p>
I would pick out Hans Moravec as the clearest example of what might be
called a "posthumanist" in that he really does not seem to care whether he
personally, or today's humans, survive. He seems only (or predominantly)
interested in SIs appearing. Perhaps it would make sense to reserve the
term "posthumanist" for those who have little or no concern for their own
survival and progress or that of other current humans, instead valuing the
creation of more capable beings (rather than a co-existence or integration).
