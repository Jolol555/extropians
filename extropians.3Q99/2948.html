It is very important to indicate the historical origins of designations of
terms like "right" and left" not so much to point out that they have
outlived their usefulness, but to remind us that political and social
terms that are alive and well will change their meaning and significance 
over time.  Nothing could make the continued relevance of the ideas of
"right" and "left" more palpable to me than the weird experience I have
had as a lefty sort of person reading transhumanist lists over the past
six years or so, simultaneously exhilarated by the repudiation of
"natural" defenses of the status quo, but equally disturbed and perplexed
by the default championing of whatever counts from moment to moment as a
"market outcome".
<p>
	Even if it is true that the very idea of a "right" and a "left" is
on its way to becoming absolutely obsolete (and I do not believe that it
is), the fact is we are talking about the future in the *present*, and our
visions, our conversations, and our strategies are inflected by the
perceptions and ideologies of the present day.  If transhumanist fora take
it for granted that American-libertarian strategies and formulations are
simply and self-evidently the "answer" to societal ills, the result is
that we are talking to ourselves, and that these fora simply do not
participate centrally in the global conversations through which the world
will continue to be transformed in the shape of cultural values.
Kathryn's recent attempts to point out that it *matters* that these fora
do not reflect the diversity of the world we presume to be speaking to are
a variation of the point I'm making, and I agree with her that these
things matter.
<p>
	Leftropians of the world, fan out!
