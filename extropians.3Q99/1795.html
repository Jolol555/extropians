The real trick to those 3d images is to be a bit walleyed, as I am.
It seems to be a genetic trait- I had surgery to correct it when I
was 13, my son had it at age ten, and in old photographs I can see
that my grandfather and his great-uncle (a particularly successful
mercenary captain by the name of Giuseppe Garibaldi) also had a
"lazy" left eye.

<p>
Anyway, I can view old fashioned stereo pairs without a viewer- and
stereo pictures were the first time I *ever* saw in 3d.  It was a
stunning experience.  After the corrective surgery, I had much
greater appreciation for the female form, too... depth perception is
a wonderful thing.
