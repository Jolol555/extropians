Billy sorry about the slow answer.  Ive been on the road a lot
this summer and just now found this in my unanswered inbox.

The Star Wars movie got me to thinking that strong nanotech
<a name="0497qlink1">could result in a device that is kinda analogous to a neuron, except
much smaller.</a>  I imagined that a number of them could interconnect
themselves with carbon nanotubes, thereby forming a webby
cocoon around a mitochondrion, living on a small amount of
excess ATP.  If each of these nanoneurons and its interconnection
were made of, say sixty thousand carbon atoms, and there were a
billion of them on the surface of a mitochondrion, the mitochondrion
would never know they were there.  The combined mass</a> of the
billion nanoneurons would be about one nanogram.  Peach
fuzz on an elephant.
