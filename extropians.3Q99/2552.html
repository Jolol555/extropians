But Phil Osborn's Tuesday, August 17, 1999 6:11 PM post was:
"Cybersex between a computer and human in a virtual reality suit would make
sense but between two computers????"</a>

<p>
That kind of led me to believe he meant that computers and presumably
anything running on a computer -- such as an uploaded personality -- having
orgasms is questionable.  If this _was_ not Phil's position, then I've
misread
<br>
him here, though only slightly.:)

<p>

<a href="2536.html#2552qlink2">&gt; any indication that anyone in the discussion knows what an orgasm is.</a><br>

<p>
I will NOT claim to be an expert in what orgasms are.  At best, I know a bit
about them from having experienced them quite often.:):):)  However, Robert
Bradbury answers this in another post, so I need not repeat what he's said.

<p>
But getting back to uploaded people and AI having sex and orgasms (what is
sex with an orgasm?  A waste of time?:), I don't know how much detail one
needs to understand a giving phenomena to upload it.  If uploading, at
first, is merely making an isomorphic model of a biobrain on a computer,
then there might be little need to understand much about how orgasms or
arousal or an appreciation of this debate works.  Instead, we might just
copy over the contents and make sure the computer can make the local changes
that biobrains make -- viz., having simulated inputs and simulated neuron
firings.

<p>
Of course, I think that will only be the first attack on the problem.  Who
would want to upload merely to run a faster copy of their current mind?
Many, but quite a few would want to improve things.  I, for one, would like
to remove bad parts of my personality.  For instance, my argumentative
attitude.:)

<p>
(Of course, Anders and others have knowledge of this, while I'm merely
speculating based on a few things I've read here and there.)

<p>
Cheers!
