<a name="3724qlink2">I appreciate the satire but I think you're being unfair.</a>  Now I know that 
<a name="3724qlink3">there are some scenarios explored here that do posit change so rapid that 
just about any steps to deal with them would be ineffective, but I happen to 
think that most of them have relatively low probability.  To say that we have 
no "surf boards" or "surfing expertise" relevant to other, more probable 
scenarios isn't true, at least for many of the folks I know personally here 
</a>on the list.<a name="3724qlink4">  Perhaps most importantly, we're working on building personal 
wealth and successful careers, which is perhaps the single most important 
thing you can do now to be ready for the next two or three turbulent decades.</a> 
<a name="3724qlink5"> Through events like the EXTRO conferences and personal networking here and 
in organizations like Foresight and new developments like the Kronos clinics, 
we're networking with people who are building the surfboards.  By staying 
abreast of the latest developments in the key technologies, we're keeping 
ourselves aware of the cool new rides that will show up on the beach.</a>

Kahuna when it hits, I'm going to try</a> . . .
