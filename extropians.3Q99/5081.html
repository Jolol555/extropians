     But wait. Is/are the other "channel[s]" necessarily bad? (And
    wouldn't arguing for their badness be misogynistic, "[s]"
    notwithstanding?) And does "baseness," or the directly
    pleasurable, entail badness -- or non-artistic?


<p>
A good point, raising more philosophic worries about Freud than thoughtful 
artspeak. 

<p>
Hedonistic tendencies in artists have been world famous, but as someone else 
points out, not limited to artists. Calling people bad in the sense of 
moralizing, is the theologian's job anyway, not the artist's.

            If science is about giving us direct access to pleasure, might
        the success of science mean the elimination of art? Who would
</pre>
    need art with virtual dopamine? (And if "No!", then: Who needs
    science, with non-virtual art?) Quaeritur.

Art is not for your pleasure. It is sometimes a cause of pleasure, but hold 
no illusions that it is created for your pleasure. Art has many functions, 
which is why I have not entered into the layman's debate over art's 
"Purpose." 

<p>
It's like taking apart a squirrel to see how it works. When you put it back 
together it isn't functioning quite the same.


<p>
We can simplify art, or we could  - and we do -  pedestalize it. But the 
fruits it yields are intangible and rare.

<p>
Art is valuable as a tool. Most people do not understand how effective this 
tool is, or how it works, but they are nonetheless effected by it.
