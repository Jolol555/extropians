It's the anomalies that allow our scientific knowledge to

  Why aren't telekenesis researchers physicists or telepathy

<p>
First of all, the guys at PEAR are physicists.  Secondly,
are you serious?  Only staying within the realms of
common sense?  Get a clue! Einstein's Relativity is about
as uncommon sense as you can get, and QM is even weirder
than that.  Where have you been?
