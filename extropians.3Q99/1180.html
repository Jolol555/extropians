way in the direction of cost. Things like rib and skull x-rays give very
little in the way of useful information that actually effects an individual's
treatment. They tend to be used by medicos to justify the exorbitant cost of
an office or ER visit.

   "We need these films to diagnose  you." translates MOST of the time to: "
You don't need a damn thing from me but to convince you that  your trip to (
ER, Chiro office, etc)  wasn't an utter waste of time and  money, I'll get
some useless x-rays. That way I cover my ass  in the event that a gadzillion
to one shot occurs and I can point to my heroic efforts to determine the
cause of your mysterious malady when/if your ambulance chasing attorney has
me on the stand.
<p>
   In many situations 80 + % of all radiology procedures serve no useful
purpose. I say that even though that's how I earn my living. Your tax dollars
at work!
