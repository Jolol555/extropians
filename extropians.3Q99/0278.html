Reasonable rhetorical questions, Count.  I do think, however, that 
discussion(s) of current and near-future technologies as they relate to the 
whole aggression/defense thing is rather relevant.  As methodological 
individualists, it is always interesting to dialect-out the issues/memes 
surrounding a given technology vis-a-vis aggression/defense, etc.  What's 
the social dynamic/dialectic of "X" technology?  What legal rules might we 
need?  What rule(s) is(are), by what ever criteria, "optimal."  Etc.,  etc.  
As both methodological and normative individualists, it's always at least 
somewhat productive to discuss current technologies, as they relate to 
interpersonal relations, and then extrapolate the basic 
arguments/memes/protocols into the context of future technology(s).  Of 
course, admittedly, extrapolation can be (and oftentimes more-or-less 
inherently is) off-the-mark (sometimes, way off!).  Cf. Deutch's discussion 
("story"), in the last chapter of his very (re)commendable book, *Fabric of 
Reality,* of the medieval architect who, suddenly finding himself in OUR 
culture and, most especially, with OUR tech-know-how, exclaims, "Gee!  We 
can NOW build a MILE-HIGH cathedral--ain't it great!?!?!!!  Of course, *WE* 
NOW have no such interest whatsoever.  So extrapolation is oftentimes 
frought with such problems.  Nevertheless, it's (way) better than NOTHING, 
and can help dialect-out (meta)memes for the TRANSITION period(s) as we 
begin to actualize/instantiate new, world-changing technologies (and this 
point is meant to be more-or-less explictly Hayekian/Popperian/Habermasian, 
in case anyone gives an (intellectual) hoot!!  (and yeah, yeah, yeah, I 
realize that's a heck of combination of personages just now, but hey, check 
<br>
'em out: I think what I articulated is a good synthesis of what those guys <br>
would say on the subject....)  Anyway....gotta go.

Best regards to all,
