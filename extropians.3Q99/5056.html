Its a very complex game due to the competition involved.  Merely
producing sequences and "labeling" putative genes is insufficient
currently.  But doing anything more than that requires a fair amount
of educated "human" intelligence which is in fairly short supply at
this point.

<p>
Multiple companies had advertisements up at the TIGR Genome conference
for "Bioinformatics" specialists.

You will have to be more specific with regard to "genome components".
I believe in the Drosophila genome there is a fair amount of controversy
</a>
with regard to how many "real" genes there actually are (from 10-20 K genes).

<p>
Since we still have a very difficult time resolving # of genes in
less complex genomes, the # of genes in more complex genomes
(such as ours) is a real crapshoot.
