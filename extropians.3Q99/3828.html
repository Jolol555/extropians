 IAN: It's not just my opinion that the 
 hot-spot in question is something outside
 the window and thus on the wall where it 
 appears. Such is indicated in "Waco: The 
 Rules of Engagement," it is believed by 
 the Davidian's defense team, and by FLIR
 expert Dr. Edward Allard, as I note in my
 report with link to his testimony. Also, 
 the government's own Fire Report states 
 that that hot-spot is the origin of the 
 fire. So this raises the question: Why 
 is the origin of the fire some static 
<br>
 heat source fixed on the outside wall?
<br>
 The Govt alleges that the hot-spot is 
<br>
 a fire inside the room seen through the 
 window, but as we can see even in the 
<br>
 reduced image at my site, it's just 
<br>
 above the window, not within it. 

<p>
 Thanks for sharing your commentary on
<br>
 W:ROE, I agree with it. The gun shots 
<br>
 are unmistakable, and, as Dr. Allard 
<br>
 and other FLIR experts stipulate, 
<br>
 they cannot be explained by any other
<br>
 phenomena but the muzzle flashes of guns;
 and they're directed towards the building.
<a name="3833qlink1"> This supports no other conclusion than
<br>
 that mass murder was the Govt's intent.</a>
 McNulty's new documentary will also show
 video of a helicopter around back shooting 
 down at the building on the last day. These 
 are the actions of the same Organized Mob 
 that many want all guns surrendered to!

<p>
 If Columbine means The People should be 
 disarmed, what does the planned slaughter 
 at Waco mean? I guess we should believe it
 means that only the Govt should have guns.
 Why would anyone want us to surrender our
 defenses to an entity that perpetrates
<br>
 mass murder in the U.S. and abroad??!
<br>
 I'd not want that for my worst enemy.
<br>
 Seems clear to me that The People are
<br>
 defined as "the enemy" by their Govt.
<br>
 This doesn't bode well for the future!
