a 5 kg (?) liver from a single cell with a 24 hour

<p>
<a name="3106qlink6">The question comes down to how much you can "push"
mammalian growth (e.g. with hyperoxygenation/glucose
levels, hormones, etc.).  What is the fastest growing mammal?
And would this result in an organ that was "prematurely"
aged?  [Pushing division rates=pushing mutations, pushing
oxygen levels=pushing free radical damage, pushing glucose=
pushing protein glycosylation, etc.]</a>

<i>&gt; cells are maintaining).</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3106qlink8">I've thought about this as well.  I think there are going to
be three very interesting avenues; (a) hormones to promote
axonal hypergrowth; (b) hormones to promote stem cell multiplication
and (c) stem cell injections, perhaps followed by (a) or (b).

<p>
I think (a) gets you back to the childhood state of hyperlearning,
perhaps sacrificing some of your "known" knowledge.</a>  I agree
<a name="3106qlink9">that rehearsing would repattern old memories on new cells, I
suspect however that without such rehearsing (and I'm sure
you can't rehearse "everything"), that much of the old information
will fade away.</a>

<p>
<a name="3153qlink1">I am "Robert Bradbury++++", my mind has been painted over four
times, I can no longer remember my childhood, etc.  I think
Heinlein discussed that Lazarus Long had undergone some mental
compression to make room for more information as the years
had gone by.  [I guess thats what happens without nanotech!]</a>

<a name="3106qlink10"><a href="3063.html#3079qlink4">&gt; In fact, it seems that we pretty much have the science for this</a><br>
<i>&gt; to take place -- certainly in many organs -- just not, for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most part, the technology (though even that we partly have, in a</i><br>
