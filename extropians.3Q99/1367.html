If I were trying to construct a detailed, realistic model of the effects of
some particular supernova, you would be correct.  Fortunately, I'm not
trying to do astronomy here.  I think that even the most pessimistic
assumptions you can make will give you an event that has little or no effect
on a technological civilization, even at very close distances.

<p>
My preliminary calculation made the following very pessimistic assumptions:


<OL>
  <li>  perfectly transparent interstellar space
  <li>  all the energy arrives at the same time
  <li>  you get to presume that 100% of it is whatever form of energy you think
would be the most deadly


</OL>
<p>
I still get completely trivial exposure numbers at a distance of only 1
light year.  Now, everyone seems to have this "deadly supernova" meme so
firmly fixed in their heads that they still aren't convinced, despite the
fact that virtually everything that has ever been published on the topic was
*science fiction* (which typically has only a distant relationship with
scientific fact).  I guess I'll have to find some authoritative references
for my starting numbers, and include all the details of the calculations
this time.

<p>
Stay tuned, I'll post the URL in a week or so.
