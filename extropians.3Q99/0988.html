<a href="0945.html#0988qlink1">&gt; (Lee Crocker, apparently recognized as one of the most rational</a><br>
<i>&gt; posters, accused me of _making up_ SPSR...</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1018qlink2">I have no problem with people accusing me of being a pompous
ass (I often am), but this is simply 100% false.  I made no such
accusation.  Indeed, not one word of anything I have written
accused Mr. Tonnies of anything but gullibility.</a>  If Mr. Tonnies
has taken my commentaries about crackpots personally, then perhaps
I have not been clear enough in my language.  I explained my
purposes for doing so, and already pointed out that he was not
personally the object of my ridicule.  I ridicule ideas, not
people.  If I wanted to accuse someone of something, everyone on
this list knows me well enough to know that I wouldn't be vague
about it--I'd say it plainly.

<p>
For the record, I think Mr. Tonnies is merely advocating research
on a subject he sincerely believes has merit.  I never said anything
more or less than that about him.  I not only disagree that the
subject has merit, I think many /other/ people with less sincerity
and more dubious motives created the whole mess, and I pointed to
some signs of their deception.  I do /not/ think Mr. Tonnies is one
of these people; I merely think he gives them more credibility than
is justified by the facts.
