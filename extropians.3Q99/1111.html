Some theories suggest that a *normal* human birth *is* a premature
birth by primate standards, this being necessitated by the size of the
human infant cranium.  My original post suggested evolution of humans
perhaps works like a row of dominoes:


<OL>
  <li>  straight knees show up, which
  <li>  frees up the hands for manipulating objects, which
  <li>  favors those mutations which tend toward the opposable thumb and
  <li>  favors those feet which are better at distance walking on the savanna
  <li>  and tends away from the opposable toe (damn it), but
  <li>  the savanna walking lifestyle favors bigger brains, for hunting and battle,
which
  <li>  is more easily accomplished assuming large headed infants, which
  <li>  kills mama less often if born somewhat premature, which
  <li>  leads to a species that more or less *always* born premature, which
  <li>  need a lotta love and attention from mama, which
  <li>  causes her to be less available for hunting and/or gathering, so
  <li>  she could *really* use dad's help in getting food, and that
  <li>  causes her to realize mr. brains might be a better bet or more reliable
than
  <li>  mr. buns, which causes her to choose him more often, which
  <li>  cycles back to step 7.
