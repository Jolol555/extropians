From: "Gina Miller" &lt;nanogirl@halcyon.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="4172.html#4190qlink1">&gt;This story reminds me of a lady who lived in one of my childhood</a><br>
<i>&gt;cities. She lived on a corner house that exuded beside a regularly</i><br>
<i>&gt;traveled street. (4th and Ash) Anyways, as every place one can</i><br>
<i>&gt;live as a child seems to inhabit some mysterious persona of fear,</i><br>
<i>&gt;she was ours. She was never seen, ordered in and had lived in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;particular residence long before anyone could place her. The most</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious of her idiosyncrasies was that the outside of her entire</i><br>
<i>&gt;house (windows and front door included and only excluding the</i><br>
<i>&gt;roof) was wallpapered so to speak with aluminum foil. It was</i><br>
<i>&gt;rumoured that this was her means of repellant against the aliens.</i><br>
<i>&gt;This would protect her from them. At the time, I recall</i><br>
<i>&gt;assimilating this to the likes of the tradition in India, where</i><br>
<i>&gt;mirrors protect people when placed strategically in fabrics, bags</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc. from evil spirts. Their theory is if the evil spirit see's</i><br>
<i>&gt;his own reflection, it will scare him away. I once had a bag that</i><br>
<i>&gt;I purchased from a friends "hippie store" with these mirrors on</i><br>
<i>&gt;them. Although I never met the mysterious shiny house lady or the</i><br>
<i>&gt;original person in question from the previous story, It makes you</i><br>
<i>&gt;wonder about the human psyche. (twilight zone music plays in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;background- collective consciousness) anyways, I use mirrors for</i><br>
<i>&gt;various purposes, however not one of them are these, the same</i><br>
<i>&gt;goes for aluminum foil. Just thought I'd throw in a similar</i><br>
<i>&gt;character for notation.</i><br>

<p>
Mirrors are a classic element in Feng Shui for you amateur
geomancers/geotechs out there.

on the head to protect against aliens is a classic sign of
schizophrenia.

<p>
A number of people who work at night including according to legend,
Elvis, put foil on bedroom windows to completely darken it for
sleeping during the day.</a></a>

an effective shield against "radio waves" or microwaves, nor would
it be an effective anti-Tempest defense. (Van Eck Radiation)</a></a>
