<a name="1793qlink1">Yes.  It's been a long time since I've done this myself, so I practiced in the
mirror today to see what results I could get.  I have brown hair, and ended up
seeing a faint blue and yellow aura around my head.  Here is what you do. Face the
mirror with your back about 2 feet (60 cm) from the wall.  Make sure the wall is
white.  The trick is to look at your head but focus your eyes on the wall behind
you.  If you can maintain your focus behind you while glancing at the outline of
your head and body, you should begin to notice the 'aura' effect.

<a name="1793qlink2">Sometimes I can see vibrant aura's with lots of colors extending up to a foot away
<a name="1793qlink3">from a persons body, but other days barely anything at all.  I have about the same
success as seeing those damn 3-d images that were so popular a couple of years
back. :-)
