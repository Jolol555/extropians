<p>
These are the techniques I use to make my observations.  I don't know who 
Gurdieff is, I discovered it myself when I was about 11.  That was the time 
I truly comprehended what it meant to die.  I knew for a fact then that 
there was no heaven, hell, after-life, God, or gods.  Before then I was 
agnostic.  Having no evidence, direct or indirect, and recognizing the 
childish beliefs of my father and close relatives I just couldn't believe 
what I was being told; so, I had to find out for myself.  That is when I 
became a philosopher and studied everything around me, finding my own 
answers to questions.  Around 12 or 13 I started exploring my own thoughts.  
I noticed that my thoughts and memories usually 'triggered' other thoughts 
and memories.  I knew then that they must be related.  Also, having been 
institutionalized for 3 years I had a chance to study the minds of mentally 
ill patients and the minds of mentally capable psychologist and 
psychiatrist.  While there I also learned about memory.  I paid close 
attention to the tests the doctors gave me and questioned my self why they 
asked the questions they did and why were they constantly performing CAT 
scans.
<br>
To this day all I know why is that there is something 'odd' about my brain.  
I always thought these doctors were pretty stupid if they can only tell my 
brain was 'odd' and couldn't tell me what made it odd.
I must have been part of some sort of experiment or something because they 
wouldn't tell me a dam thing!

<p>
Anyways, there came a time when I had no emotions at all.  Complete 
indifference.  That lasted a few months until they started pumping me with 
all sorts of medication.  But during that time is when I came across my most 
important discoveries about myself.  Those are what I'm trying to write 
down, for the first time, in my posts.  Some of the things I figured out I 
can't remember very well.  Like how 'free will' works.

<p>
When they finally let me go, I was a complete emotional idiot!  I've been 
working for 2 years now to rebuild myself.  It took more than 2 years to 
discover how stupid I had become.  Entered a genius, exited a slightly above 
average idiot.

<p>
But my point is, you can observe thoughts go through your mind, you just 
can't think about them as they occur unless you develop a side (thread) 
thought process.  You can do that through practice.  Start out trying to do 
two simple math problems at once.

<p>
And yes, random interrupts would be necessary.
Any evidence for this as of yet?  Anyone know?
