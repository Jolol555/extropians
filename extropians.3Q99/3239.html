While the belief that people are equal is, as R. A. Wilson might say, a game
rule of democracy, it does not appear to reflect reality.  Would I hold a
nation hostage to get what I want?  No, at least not under any circumstances
I can currently imagine.  But are there others who would?  Almost
definitely!  What about terrorists and militia members who're willing to
blow up whole buildings and airliners and use nerve gas and anthrax on
unsuspecting civilians?  Or the various individuals we periodically see in
the news who were pissed off at the world and one day decided to take their
revenge by sending people mail bombs, or walking into their office and
blowing away as many people as possible?

The reality is that there are always at least a few people who are, by any
arbitrary definition of the term, 'no damn good'.  Of course it's foolish
and ignorant to view any ethnic group with suspicion because of the acts of
a few individuals.  In fact, that's the problem: you never know who the bad
apples are.

<p>
I think this is a gross oversimplification.  It is an objective fact that
some people engage in terrorism.  Some have mental problems that render them
a danger to others.  Some are violent alcoholics who beat their wives and
children.  Certainly it would be irrational and paranoid to believe that all
people are 'no damn good'.  But it's perfectly rational to acknowledge that
some people are not playing by the same rules you are.
