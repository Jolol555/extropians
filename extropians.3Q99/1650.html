<a name="1668qlink1">  IAN: Fuzzy logic has been receiving far

  Medical studies show that placebo patients 
  tend to report more symptoms than they did 
  before taking the placebo, which means that 
  the mind is superimposing its expectations.
  Also, a sizable non-zero percentage of those
  on placebo report getting better. If you took 
  the same placebo pill and put it on the market,
  a sizable non-zero percentage of people taking
  that phoney medicine would report getting better,
  and they would go tell their friends and you'd 
  have an constant non-zero market for sugar pills
  and bottles of water without medicinal content.
  That's how homeopathy works, placebo effect.
