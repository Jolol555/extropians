<a href="2162.html#2321qlink1">   &gt;If I recall my psychology classes, rats will stimulate their pleasure centers,</a><br>
<i>   &gt;forgetting to eat or drink.  I wonder if humans will do the same thing?  </i><br>

<p>
Is there any doubt at all? That's all most people ever do, once they're through working -- things that stimulate adrenaline or serotonin or beta-endorphine production vicariously. 

<p>
If so
<p>
<a href="2162.html#2321qlink2">   &gt;we probably get some rapid selection for those people who have no interest in sex.</a><br>
<i>   &gt;Its either that or mandatory (state?) adjustment of those parts of the brain so</i><br>
<i>   &gt;(a) you have long refractory periods and (b) can't self-edit.</i><br>

<p>
I have a different theory: those will succeed who can learn to associate pleasure, perhaps even sexual pleasure, to tribe dominance inside the virtual community -- just the same as happens out here.

<p>
<a href="2162.html#2321qlink3">   &gt;We would probably get new laws that include restrictions such as a maximum</a><br>
<i>   &gt;daily orgasm quota and a huge black market for software that can reset the</i><br>
<i>   &gt;counters.</i><br>

<p>
There was a movie about 15 years ago called Brainstorm I think, Natalie Wood's last film, in which a device had been invented which could record a person's experience and play it back to someone later. One guy, of course, got hold of a tape of a person having wild sex, and, of course, cut the tape so it played in a loop. When they found this guy after about eight hours, he was a gibbering idiot.
