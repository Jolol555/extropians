<a name="0718qlink1"><a href="0692.html#0714qlink1">&gt;&gt;The processed images of the Face have produced a wealth of evidence </a><br>

<i>&gt;ROTFLMAO... I'm not even going to touch this one.</i><br>

<p>
While I have no clue what "ROTFLMAO" stands for ("rolling on the 
floor"-something, I guess), I really don't get why this is an "untouchable."  
No one with common sense is saying there are unquestionably alien artifacts 
on Mars.  But the possibility is there, and we have the means to _test_ the 
Intelligence Hypothesis in the very near future, using proven hardware.</a>

<p>
I simply don't see why a group who can digest concepts such as brain 
downloading and superintelligences can't admit the possibility of some 
anomalous formations on a neighboring planet.  There's really nothing to lose 
with this one.  But, as is usual with this subject, it's being interpreted as 
an emotional issue...and in the meantime, evidence is ignored.
