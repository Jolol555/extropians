No doubt, but a neutrino isn't like a glove -- or, more appositely,
like a screw.  Its<a name="2360qlink1"> handedness is determined by its spin _relative to
its momentum_.  If its rest mass is zero, that is an unambiguous
definition, because there is no frame of reference in which the
momentum is reversed.  But if the neutrino as a rest mass, then it has
a rest frame, in which its momentum is zero, and the helicity is not
even defined.  Its spin, presumably, can be in any direction whatever.</a>
You can then give it either a right-hand or a left-hand thread by
choosing the direction in which your frame of reference moves with
respect to it.

<p>
Well, maybe so; but suppose I decelerate a neutrino to rest and then
accelerate it to a near-c velocity in the other direction.  What do I
have, then?  A phony antineutrino -- a particle with the
antineutrino's helicity but the neutrino's lepton number?
