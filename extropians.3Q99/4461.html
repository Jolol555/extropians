This isn't exactly right, although it's generally got the gist of things 
correct.  Your first example is certainly correct: Parties to a contract have 
to be "competent" to make the contract.  Thus, infants and the insane can't 
generally be bound by contracts.  (But as we've discussed, they can be 
"represented" by a guardian ad litem or other trustee such that a binding 
contract can be made that bears on their interests.)  

<p>
The second example is wrong, but it's a common misconception. Sane adults are 
generally presumed to be able to read and understand contracts.  The fact 
that one party has a lawyer involved in the process and the other doesn't is 
not a basis for abrogating a contract under the general common law of 
contract.  Unfortunately, there's been a steady legislative erosion of this 
principle during this century, with a tangled web of "consumer protection" 
statutes that make special exceptions for one kind of contract or another.  
Insurance contracts are a typical example these days: You have to know a 
whole host of special legislative rules to know when the plain language of an 
insurance contract will be enforceable against the insured because of the 
many special rules that have been passed to "protect the little guy".  Of 
course, this lack of predictability just makes it more expensive (or 
impossible in some cases) to buy insurance, defeating the avowed purpose of 
these laws in the first place to protect the interests of consumers.  
Furthermore, such rules steadily erode the principle of personal 
responsibility, undermining the seriousness with which people consider the 
contracts into which they enter: "I don't have to read that - there's no way 
they can enforce a tough contract against me!"

<p>
The other major exceptions to the enforceability of contracts are 
"illegality" (identified by Lee Crocker in a subsequent post) and fraud.  
"Illegality" is just a general term to describe things the state won't let 
you agree to, such as many wagering contracts, a contract for prostitution, 
etc.  Fraud is the most important (and complex) common law exception to 
contractual enforceability (and also one about which there are a lot of 
common misconceptions).  The elements of common law fraud are an intentional 
factual misrepresentation made with the intent of detrimental reliance and 
subsequent actual detrimental reliance.  A contract that embodies fraud is 
unenforceable.
