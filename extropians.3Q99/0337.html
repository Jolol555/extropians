One problem. Our DNA code only describes a human infant given a human adult.


<OL>
  <li>  The genetic code doesn't describe the human adult required to "compile" the
DNA.

  <li>  A human infant isn't even a human adult. As I understand it, a human infant IS
hardwired to learn LOTS of environmental stuff very quickly, but you need the
description of the whole environment, as well, as (presumably) human quality
agents already in the environment.


</OL>
<p>
This is the major problem, that the development of a mind from infant to human
quality requires existing human quality minds.

<p>
<a name="0368qlink1">Piaget established reasonably firmly that human infants, at various stages up to
about 7-8 years, are not merely less knowledgeable adults, but their brains (basic
operations like perception, causal analysis) work in completely different ways
then adults. To describe an adult brain with adult knowledge/perceptual structures
probably requires a lot more data then to describe an infant's mind, which (as I
understand it) is array upon array of undifferentiated "learning" structures.</a>
