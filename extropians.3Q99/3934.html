<p>
  IAN: When I say "The intent of the Govt at 
  Waco was X," I assume that most people would 
  understand this to mean "All agents of the 
  Govt who were involved in planning operations 
  at Waco." One can, in fact, find statements
  to that effect through the literature on the 
  subject. There's no real ambiguity here.

<p>
  If someone said "The Govt did not plan to 
  commit mass murder at Waco," it would not
  be logical to posit thus that their claim 
  was "bogus" (as you suggest mine was) simply 
  because they used a word with global meaning. 
  So I fail to see the logic of your thinking. 

<p>
  As I see it, and maybe this is dishonest
  as you imply, if the FBI releases video 
  to the Davidian's defense and on it there 
  are muzzle flashes of guns firing heavily 
  at the Center, firing in conjunction with 
  the activities of tanks and heavily as the 
  fire breaks out, this means that part of 
  the plan was to fire guns at the Center 
  even as the fire breaks. Because guns 
  kill people, it therefore follows that 
  part of the plan was to kill people, a 
  lot of people, which is mass murder.

<p>
<a name="3941qlink1">  If the evidence shows Govt agents acting 
  in an organized/planned fashion, firing 
  guns into a building filled with people,
  I can't think of any more appropriate 
  conclusion to draw than that the Govt 
  acted with intent to commit mass murder.</a>
  I'm sure that if the Davidians had so
<br>
  assembled around a building and started
  to fire heavily into it, anyone who said
  they were NOT trying to commit mass murder
  would be declared dishonest, but put Govt
  agents in their place and the very same
  conclusion would be portrayed as honest.
