It is indeed!

<p>
They say they're showing it again in a few months. It's not a great segment,
though. I'm told my cat was the best part. (And they cut most of my
guitar-playing!)

<p>
Seriously, the main problem was that they refused to let me talk about the CR
study that I, Walford, and some members of the CR Society are involved in. ("You
don't have an M.D., so you wouldn't have enough authority....") So it looked
more or less like I just cooked the diet up on my own "after reading a few
studies." (Though they show a few numbers on my computer screen, which looked
vaguely science-oid).

<p>
Well, if the answer to the latter question is ys, just how hard IS it to start a
country? (I tried once in second or third grade, after being kicked out of CCD
for refusing to stop asking about the women from Nod. My resources, were,
unfortunately, extremely limited, and no one wanted to trade with a heathen
sandbox-nation anyway.)
