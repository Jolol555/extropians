<i>&gt; &gt;I do not agree with you, Kathryn. Let me explain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;Is the above really interesting?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Gosh, I didn't know it had to interest you in particular to be a valid</i><br>
<i>&gt;concern.  It sure interests me--from my end things are pretty darned lonely</i><br>
<i>&gt;and sometimes very stressful.  It also interests the five or so women who</i><br>
<i>&gt;dropped in on the lists last year, had a miserable experience, and wrote to</i><br>
<i>&gt;me about it. (and left)</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2982qlink1">I don't know anything about this, since I wasn't a member of the list then. 
Could you please explain further?</a>

<p>
<a href="2900.html#2950qlink2">&gt;Also, we are still largely European and Euro-American.  There is a big</a><br>
<i>&gt;expansion ahead, but we are still talking amongst ourselves as if *we*</i><br>
<i>&gt;comprise all there is to transhumanism!  There is a huge set of</i><br>
<i>&gt;perspectives and experiences left untapped, and we may not get to tap into</i><br>
<i>&gt;them unless we make some effort.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, you are right. Some of these groups do not even seem to be active on 
the Internet.

<p>
<a name="2982qlink2">"Effort" could simply mean making
<br>
<a href="2900.html#2950qlink3">&gt;ourselves known in forums and networks we hadn't previously considered.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Simple coalition-building techniques.  Right now our networking is very</i><br>
<i>&gt;narrow in scope, tends to be among those we feel comfortable</a> with.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2982qlink3">You're right. What forums and networks do you have in mind?</a>

<p>
<a href="2900.html#2950qlink4">&gt; &gt;We should be looking out for good prospects</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;in general, without looking for a specific gender (what are genders going </i><br>
<i>&gt;to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;be in the future, probably intersexuality or serial gender), race (hey, I </i><br>
<i>&gt;am</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;a mix of Swedish, Italian and Norwegian), age (we should have more 500 </i><br>
<i>&gt;year</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;old members, agree to that).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was very careful not to suggest 'recruting' or 'quotas', and yet this</i><br>
<i>&gt;statement always comes up whenever someone tries to discuss diversity.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;lurking PC club used to stifle discussion....</i><br>

<p>
Sorry, I too accustomed to the stifled debate climate here in Swiiiden:-) 
Here it is automatic that whenever discuss these things you propose that the 
government should a law about it. So sorry, I'm not in the habit to discuss 
it with sensible persons like you.

<p>
Sincerely
