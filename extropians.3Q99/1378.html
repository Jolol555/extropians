<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; THE 6 BILLIONTH BABY</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Population experts expect that between now and the end of the year, a</i><br>
<i>&gt; newborn somewhere will be the 6 billionth human on Earth.  Many factors</i><br>
<i>&gt; will affect the health and development of that child, and in many cases</i><br>
<i>&gt; will predetermine the baby's future.  That future is likely to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; considerably brighter if this baby is born in an industrialized country</i><br>
<i>&gt; than if he or she is born in the developing world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the child is born in Switzerland, she is likely to live to age 82; and</i><br>
<i>&gt; if a boy, to age 75.  But if born in Sierra Leone, she is likely to live to</i><br>
<i>&gt; age 39; and if a boy, to 36.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the child is born in the Netherlands, he runs a risk of 1% of not living</i><br>
<i>&gt; to his fifth birthday and a 9% risk of not seeing his 60th.  If born in</i><br>
<i>&gt; Niger, he runs a risk of 8% of not living to see his fifth birthday, and a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 36% risk of not seeing his 40th.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the child is born in Austria, she will be 100% certain to grow up with</i><br>
<i>&gt; access to safe drinking water and sanitation.  If born in Afghanistan, she</i><br>
<i>&gt; will have only a 21% chance of access to safe water and a 1% chance of</i><br>
<i>&gt; access to sanitation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the child is born in the United States, he will likely live in a family</i><br>
<i>&gt; with more than $21,541 annual income.  If born in Uganda, he would likely</i><br>
<i>&gt; live in a family with about $602 annual income (based on GDP per person).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the child is born in Sweden, she will run a 7% risk of being</i><br>
<i>&gt; functionally illiterate as an adult.  If born in Senegal, she will run a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 65% risk of being illiterate as an adult.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the child is born in Belgium, he will have available to him 3,543</i><br>
<i>&gt; calories a day and 102 grams of protein (average availability, not actual</i><br>
<i>&gt; consumption because it includes waste).  If born in Bolivia, he will have</i><br>
<i>&gt; available to him 2,170 calories a day and 56 grams of protein.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (Availability of 2,000 calories or less is considered a severe shortage,</i><br>
<i>&gt; availability of 2,000-2,300 calories a day is considered shortage.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the child is born in Canada, she will live as one of 8 people sharing</i><br>
<i>&gt; one square mile of land.  If born in China, she will live as one of 327</i><br>
<i>&gt; people sharing one square mile of land.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If the child is born in Italy, he will likely live in a city, as 90% of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Italians do.  If born in India, he will likely live in a rural area because</i><br>
<i>&gt; 72% of the Indians do.</i><br>

<p>
How does has the supply and demand for oxygen changed as civilization
has expanded to play a part in virtually every ecosystem.?

<p>
Has human activity created a net surplus or deficit?
