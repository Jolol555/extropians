I don't have an objection to that.  My point had to do with the basis upon which Robert made that assertion, and I wanted to point out some information that, hopefully, will lead him to explore more of the activities in general tranhumanism.  From all indications, Robert is very committed to extropianism and probably makes a very good board member for ExI.

Well, not all others!  I don't generally approach intellectual debate thinking that I have the penultimate solution to any given problem.  The input of more brains is more effective than just using my brain.  We can all link together, such as on the 'hard questions' thread you p proposed, and on the 'dangers' thread that Waldemar started.  

<p>
<a href="3232.html#3242qlink4">&gt;We can still act like civilized humans and work together toward &gt;common goals and learn from each other's arguments; but if we both &gt;avoid conflict and walk on eggshells we won't learn a damned thing.  &gt;Conflict and competition are as necessary to progress as cooperation, &gt;and should be valued just as highly.</a><br>

<p>
And I haven't suggested that we do so, Lee.  You and I have had some serious debates in the past, in which I certainly haven't backed down to avoid conflict!  I hope that you and I can come to a better understanding of each other in future debate.  I may have something to contribute to the 'hard questions' thread, although I do find myself in agreement with much of what has been posted.
