<p>
Yugoslavs harking back to a golden age of tolerance and 
intellectual freedom are creating a virtual country to 
represent their ideals on the Internet. 

<p>
Cyber Yugoslavia will be born on 9 September. Anyone can 
be a citizen and everyone has to have ministerial 
responsibilities. Word has spread so fast that the online 
passport office has already been forced to close because it 
cannot cope with the demand for citizenship.
