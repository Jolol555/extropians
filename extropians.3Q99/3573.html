<a name="3580qlink1">Actually, I don't think about it like this at all and I have many more fond 
memories of my Catholic upbringing than unhappy ones.  For one thing,</a> I know 
<a name="3580qlink2">I got a MUCH better basic primary education going to parochial schools than 
my peers who went to public schools.  When I transferred into</a> public schools 
<a name="3580qlink3">in the 9th grade, I was at least two years ahead in every subject</a> and in many 
<a name="3580qlink4">areas the public school curriculum never caught up even by the end of high 
school.  Second, I was primarily educated by hip, post-Vatican II nuns, who 
were actually amazingly cool people, by and large.  After my father, my 5th 
grade teacher (good old Sister Thomas Marie) certainly did more than anyone 
else to kindle an interest in natural science in me.  I used to go up</a> to the 
<a name="3580qlink5">convent in the summer after that school year and work with her</a> cataloguing a 
<a name="3580qlink6">huge collection of exotic seashells that a parishioner had bequeathed</a> to the 
<a name="3580qlink7">school.  While we poured over the shells and looked through books</a> to identify 
<a name="3580qlink8">them we talked a lot about Darwin and evolution in an open way, something I 
wonder whether many lay teachers would have taken the time to do.</a>  The priest 
<a name="3580qlink9">who dealt with the school kids during those years was also a pretty</a> cool guy: 
<a name="3580qlink10">He drove an old MG that he worked on behind the school a lot</a> in a greasy old 
cassock.

<p>
<a name="3580qlink11">Beyond this, I was never "compelled to believe" in any oppressive way.</a>  As a 
<a name="3580qlink12">result, I never had to have a "crisis of faith" like so many people</a> who were 
<a name="3580qlink13">raised in religious surroundings.  Instead, I just naturally came to doubt 
the underlying ideas more and more, but in fact never lost an appreciation 
for the ceremony of the Roman practice.  Far from a "childhood of psychic 
abuse", I recall those times fondly as one in which I was educated in an 
ancient tradition that seemed more like something out of Hesse's</a> "Glass Bead 
<a name="3580qlink14">Game" than anything else</a> . . .
