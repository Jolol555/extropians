My hideous actions still truly shame me, and will probably haunt me for
decades to come.  As a token offer of compensation (not that i'm
pretending that any action by my worthless self could possibly compensate
for the deep scars my past writings have surely caused), i hereby promise
to donate, at my SI graduation party, either a full millisecond of
processing time for each of the list's members' favourite meme (limit of
one per original current members of the list, no copies), or a lovely pink
set of goo-proof tupperware (limited offer, available till not available,
perfect way to carry around your oranges and other brain modules).  I look
upon your magnamious selves to grant me at least a partial pardon on any
punishments, all of which i most surely deserve, that are currently
ordained as a sign of your grandiosity, taking into account my above
stated humble offer and my further promise that i am a reformed worm and
that it (i will not speak its horrific name) will never happen again.  
And, please Michael, don't shoot my kneecaps off. 
Yours ashamedly,
<br>

  This feeble apology's not nearly good enough for the sickening crime you
  perpetrated, scum. We want 500 pages of "I'm a stupid, negligent, tired,
  lazy piece of shit" in a very fine tipped pen. THEN, we may call back
the

  bounty on your mum's head. Tsk. Disgusting.      8P
