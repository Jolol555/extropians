Greg, as sad as it sounds, it may be our generation only that is turned on
by the space station meme.  I have yet to find a person under 25 that is
all that excited by it.  Perhaps the low earth orbitting station is an idea
whose time is passed.  You and I grew up with the same pictures in
the encyclopedia, the same books no doubt.<a name="0791qlink1">  I recall seeing the first
</a>
moon landing as an 8 yr old, and thinking how wicked cool is this whole
adventure.  But I have seen some of the younger crowd, Eliezer for instance,
diss the whole thing.

<p>
My view is this: even if we get nanotechnology and tinkerbellize ourselves, sooner

<p>
or later, we will convert this whole planet, then this solar system into
</a>tinkerbellized
<br>
transhumans and supporting infrastructure.  Sooner or later, we *must* go
out there.  This is why I am so interested in SETI@home, just so I can
estimate what kinds of challenges face us, or future transhumans.  spike
