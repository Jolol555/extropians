I could have made it clearer that I meant the *manufacturer*
of caravanning technology would be held liable, not that
state farm wouldnt pay the prole who hurt himself using the technology.

<p>
Agreed.  I propose that current carpool lanes along the previously
mentioned corredor be converted to caravanning lanes.  To be
c-lane certified, a car must have *all* the latest and greatest tech.
Again, the sillyclone valley is a perfect testbed for this, for we have
thouuuuuusands of people who have more money than they know
what to do with [evidence: our commically inflated real estate market,
not to mention the goofy things people currently purchase on a routine
basis, such our favorite Seattle product, coffee at a cost of about
4 dollars per bean].  Our current solution to 237-itis is to purchase
luxury rolling stock.<a name="2615qlink1">  Since there is some immutable supernatural law
of nature that *requires* us to spend hours in these conveyances,
we have plush apholstery and killer stereos.</a>  My neighbor came
home last month in a brand new $90K humvee.

<p>
If these particular overpaid, overworked, liesure-starved
yahoos are sitting in the usual crawling mass and see, in the far
left lane [divided on both sides by walls] a string of cars on each
others bumpers, streaking past at 130 kph, why they would park
their cars that evening for the last time in front of the dealer who
had the caravan-ready cars.  No questions asked.  The transition
could occur in a singularity-like revolution.

<p>
<a href="2598.html#2606qlink3">&gt; It has to do with "degrees of trust".</a><br>

<p>
Granted.  I claim that this can be accomplished, even if it must
be done gradually: caravan at a distance of 6 meters, then 5...

<p>
<a href="2598.html#2606qlink4">&gt; So, if in fact the insurance companies do not insure such situations,</a><br>
<i>&gt; I would argue that they are correct in such circumstances that they</i><br>
<i>&gt; cannot guarantee the reliability of all vehicles in such an altered</i><br>
<i>&gt; transportation environment.  It would be a prescription for negative</i><br>
<i>&gt; cash flow, if they did otherwise.</i><br>

<p>
Granted again, and so I make this modest proposal.  Make the
early adapters club for caravanning exempt from insurance and
liability.  Enter that lane at your own risk.  Make it so insurance
companies need not pay if a maverick hurts herself caravanning,
just for a technology proving period.  Declare the manufacturers
temporarily immune from product liability laws.  Convert all the current
carpooling lanes into experimental caravanning lanes.  Make the
caravanning mavericks an exclusive club, that offers rewards of
self esteem, being pioneers, being the first to legally have sex while
operating a motor vehicle, etc.  It will sell here in this valley, Robert,
in fact, *I* would buy one.

Thats what I hear.  {8^D

Sounds doable to me.  OK, lets do it.

Great reaction Robert!  {8^D  Love it when people respond to my
jokes.<a name="2615qlink2">  On the subject of moving traffic, this evening's Simpsons
episode [Hilarious!  It was the Mensa send-up episode with Steven
Hawking.] had the real solution.</a>  The Springfield Mensan town council
found that traffic moves much faster under a yellow light than under green,
so they changed out all the traffic lights to have only red and yellow.
So we line the c-lane with yellow lights to accelerate the traffic to
supersonic velocities.  Hawking's flying wheelchair would be another
great solution.  {8^D  spike
