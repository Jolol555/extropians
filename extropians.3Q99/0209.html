<i>&gt;&gt; listen to each other and understand and appreciate each others' ideas.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is a "good friend", not a good "sex partner".  Some woman may</i><br>
<i>&gt;argue that the two cannot be disconnected.</i><br>

<p>
I hardly think that needs to be argued. I can't think of a way a person
could be a good sex partner without being a good friend.</a>

<p>
My thinking was more
<br>
<a href="0203.html#0209qlink2">&gt;along the lines that in many situations sex with a partner is</a><br>
<i>&gt;more interesting than solitary sex.</i><br>


<p>
<a href="0203.html#0209qlink3">&gt;In addition, physiologically, it is impossible to self-stimulate in</a><br>
<i>&gt;certain ways (this is why you cannot tickle yourself).  When I say a</i><br>
<i>&gt;good "sex partner", I mean an individual with whom you can have sex</i><br>
<i>&gt;who can stimulate and satisfy you (sexually) in ways that you are unable</i><br>
<i>&gt;to satisfy yourself.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
You said 'partner,' someone who was having sex at the same time. Someone
could provide some kinds of good or not-good non-partnered sex without
being a good friend, I think, but as you were speaking of reproduction I
don't think this applies.


<p>
<a href="0203.html#0209qlink4">&gt;&gt; Otherwise she wouldn't want to have sex with him (we are all generalizing</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; here, of course) so it wouldn't be any good.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This may be true for you, but I suspect that there are quite a few</i><br>
<i>&gt;generation X &amp; Y women who openly "do" men.  I've known a few women</i><br>
<i>&gt;who would fall into the category of believing that "some sex" is</i><br>
<i>&gt;better than "no sex", and in situations where a "good friend &amp;</i><br>
<i>&gt;sex partner" is unavailable will pick the friendship from one</i><br>
<i>&gt;tree and the sex from another.</i><br>


<p>
<a name="0219qlink2">I believe that some women do this, even that is is common, but I can't
believe it is any more or less pleasant for the people involved depending
on one person's skills.</a> Clearly in such a situation the parties would say
what they wanted<a name="0219qlink3"> and satisfaction would depend on the level of cooperation
</a>
and so forth.<a name="0219qlink4"> Therefore I can't imagine anyone would find a use for the
findings of an independent panel or a way to serve on such a panel.
