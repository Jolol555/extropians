        Yes, I agree.  Though I found this conference to be at an equal
level of excellance as Extro-3 (if not moreso) a few of the Saturday
morning seminars were slightly alienating in their specialization.  Though
it is probably impossible to please "all the people, all the time," the
length of the conference could be extended by about a day.  Overall costs
would have to be higher of course, but given the amount of signal I was
able to consume over the weekend, any cost is too low.  

<p>
        One additional note, having conferences on a yearly basis would be
a good idea.  As these progresses are coming faster and faster, large
groups of extropians becomes more and more essential to our individual
well-being...
