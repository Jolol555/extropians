Why blame it on the government?  Actually, this is the stock market's
fault.  With everyone after you for short-term profits, nobody can...

<p>
We all have our personal boogaboos, but Bradbury has a point.  The
problem is neither monolithic government nor monolithic investors, but
monolithic companies and consumers with incomplete information.  To
quote Quidnunc:

<p>
"If one of your competitors, or a new entrant into the market, offers a
deal marginally better than yours you will, naturally enough, lose
market share.  In today's physical world, you can expect a few weeks to
react; in tomorrow's instant market, you have seconds before your share
of new deals drops to zero."

<p>
By junking all R&amp;D, you can shave a cent off your selling price and get
all the products on the market.  The problem is similar to the reason
that an oversupply can sometimes cause people to sell at a loss - if
there are 1001 sellers and 1000 buyers, then maybe 1000 sellers are
selling at a break-even price, but the last seller has a motive to sell
at less than break-even to minimize the loss.  The solution to this one
is (a) complex barter to make demand increase with supply; (b) a
ubiquitous futures market.

<p>
The solution to the R&amp;D suboptimization problem is (a) completely
informed consumers; (b) patent monopolies used to fund further research;
(c) separate R&amp;D companies or separately traded ("investable") R&amp;D divisions.
