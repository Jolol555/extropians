OpenScience? Sure, but who is going to pay for your research budget
(and your rent) today? I hear several people talking about it, sounds
good. Now down to brasstacks: tell me how to do it.

Even a small research facility on a meager budget takes several
megabucks/year to run. This ain't software industry, where you can
operate a startup out of your home and cooperate via xDSL/VPN. Can we
count on several 100 people sustainably paying 10 k$/year, year after
year?  Big spenders? Where are they?

<p>
You develop a product, potentially applicable in a G$ market. What
prevents the industry from simply taking the recipe off your website
and use it without paying a penny of royalties to you?
