I posted about that once.  I concluded that truth machines were probably
in the same "threat" category as nanotech; they would increase the
strength of all social authority, both of a government over its
citizens,<a name="3985qlink1"> and, in Western democracy *only*, it would *maybe* allow us</a> to
better control our government *if* we could interrogate politicians. 
What's the chance that Congress won't immediately outlaw all
non-governmental use, even voluntary private use, because they know damn
well they'd all be out of a job?  Virtually zero.  So truth machines
have virtually no positive effects, unless you think you can cause major
social disruption to knock Congress out of office (without truth
machines, or by broadcasting veridicated statements made overseas).

<p>
If you could successfully use truth machines as a weapon against
self-serving authority, that would cause *tremendous* social disruption
<a name="3985qlink2">as 95% of Congresspersons, high-level bureaucrats,</a> and corporate
executives went out the window.  I'm inclined to think they would band
together and use the truth machine to enforce a dictatorship.
