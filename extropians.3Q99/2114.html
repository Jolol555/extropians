<p>
<a name="2170qlink2">I'm not convinced about the need to uproot our terminology just when 
it has begun to get settled.</a>

<p>
<a name="2170qlink3">Maybe humans are essentially a "self-overcoming beast" but that 
doesn't mean that all such beasts need to be humans. For example, 
there could be non-human extraterrestrials who are also essentially 
self-overcoming beasts.</a> So why no posthumans who can also overcome 
themselves (and become more advanced posthumans, and maybe when they 
are sufficiently more advanced then it might be useful to invent a 
new term for what they are then).

<p>
<a name="2170qlink4">Think about it like this: An egg, let us say, is something whose 
nature it is to overcome itself and become a chicken. Does that mean 
that the egg is not really an egg or that the chicken is strictly 
speaking an egg? Of course not.</a> And yet it is in the chicken's nature 
to "overcome itself" and become a full-blown bird, somthing that is 
different from the chicken. Still, egg, chicken and full-blown bird 
are all different.

<p>
<a name="2170qlink5">The egg is the human or the transhuman
<br>
The chicken is the posthuman.
<br>
The full-blown bird is a more advanced posthuman.</a>

<p>
Also note that there is no implication that posthumans must replace 
humans. In nature, there are eggs, chickens and full-blown birds, and 
some of our own evolutionary ancestors are still around (though, as 
it happens, not our immediate ancestors).

<p>
<a href="2058.html#2114qlink2">&gt; So, again, I wonder: why not "human," and "humanism," or some ratcheting up of</a><br>
<i>&gt; the same: like "neo-humanism," or "ultra-humanism"?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2193qlink1"><a name="2170qlink6">"ultra-humanism" seems to mean almost exactly the same as 
transhumanism (though with somewhat tackier overtones IMHO),</a> so why 
</a>
not stick with transhumanism?<a name="2170qlink7"> The term "posthumanism" is not very 
well established so if you don't like it, don't use it. As for 
"posthumans", well, I quite like the term. As Technotranscendence 
said, it makes people think.</a> If some people get the erroneous 
impression that being posthuman entails giving up some things we 
treasure about being human, let's explain to them why that need not 
be the case. However, we could use the term "ultrahuman" as a synonym 
to posthuman, and see what catches on.
