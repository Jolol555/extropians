<p>
Hi Stan,

</a>
<p>
Yes -- more like "the" conference for this list, by the way. (For the record, he
<a name="2098qlink2">may, of course, have come up with the idea years before my email. Extropians are
capable of independent thought, you'll discover!)</a>


<p>
Thanks for the OED definitions. Very helpful --

<p>
<a href="2079.html#2087qlink3">&gt; Definitions 2 and 3 suggest going beyond the</a><br>
<i>&gt; norm, not going beyond the essence of. With those</i><br>
<i>&gt; definitions in mind, "ultrahuman" doesn't seem so</i><br>
<i>&gt; bad.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nonetheless, the "human" itself is already</i><br>
<i>&gt; something that seeks to go beyond the norm.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Why the need for a new name? If it's more than</i><br>
<i>&gt; a name, in what way is it more than what humanists</i><br>
<i>&gt; think of as the human? Your "fetishism of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; noncarbon" comment may explain much.... If so, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; appropriate term should maybe be "anticarbohumanism."</i><br>

<p>
My "fetishism" comment may indeed explain much, but I stress the "may." The
question is: What, precisely, characterizes the group of people here on this
list (which I so far consider myself a part of, though I know you are skeptical
about whether you would want to be)?

<p>
Consider these two alternative ways of characterizing the group:


<OL>
  <li>  "Humanism minus technophobia."

  <li>  "Humanism plus technophilia (or 'techno-fetishism')."



</OL>
<p>
<a name="2098qlink3">Those who would suggest that (1) is the right characterization would need to
argue that humanism actually does include technophobia.</a> If humanism included
technophobia, then "post-humanism" would be a perfectly good term -- a more
accurate term, in fact, than "ultra-humanism" (though "post-human" would _not_
be a good term). Yet I haven't seen such an argument about humanism (and believe
a sound one can't be made -- naming a few people who today call themselves
humanists but are technophobic doesn't count as an argument).

<p>
Those who would claim that (2) is the right characterization would need to argue
that technophilia -- the particular kind of technophilia that many of us have,
the kind that almost does seem like a fetishism -- makes sense. The technophilia
does not make sense, if (2) amounts to:

<p>
2a) "Humanism minus the non-technological."

<p>
The reason it wouldn't make sense, I contend, is that the sort of technophilia
suggested here would be exclusionary of the non-technological, yet potentially
useful, means to self-advancement. If (2a) describes a person's beliefs, he or
she could accurately use the term "post-humanism" to describe his/her beliefs.
But I wouldn't share those beliefs.

<p>
I think (2) may indeed amount to (2a) in some form (though perhaps without a
_complete_ exclusion of the non-technological): when you come to love something
new, you detach from the old loves, at least partly. A very tricky question,
though.

<p>
So then, yes, "anti-carbohumanism," or "non-carbohumanism," or, more precisely,
"techno-humanism" would be the most accurate term for the belief which is (2),
especially if (2) means (2a). Its not feeling right might be illuminating.


<p>
<a name="2098qlink4">Looking over various posts to this list, I think there are many people here
would accurately be described as "post-humanists." I don't share</a> their beliefs.
Others are to the current age what humanists four or so hundred years ago were
to their age. These people _should_ be called humanists (or perhaps
"ultra-humanists," or "neo-humanists"). I share their beliefs.

<p>
Brian.
