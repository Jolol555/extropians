&lt;&lt; Is there some kind of standardized EQ test?  If so, has it been found to
 actually be predictive for a person's social success?  For example, do
 people with higher EQ report higher average levels of happiness, or have
 fewer divorces? &gt;&gt;

<p>
Yes, those with higher EQ's register higher levels of contentment and joy in 
life.  .   Significantly more so, in fact!  Those lucky humans are the ones 
who seem most at ease with other people, at social functions, and somehow 
know how to 'get along better' with others.  They seem to intuitively 
understand the power of communication far better than most, and know how to 
adapt more quickly in a difficult social situation, or what to say to assuage 
a problem with others. In my opinion, they are the ones at the top of the 
<br>
'antheap'!<br>

<p>
 If I had a choice between high 'IQ' (as defined by most, albeit antiquated 
testing in this country), and a high 'EQ', there would be no hesitation to 
select the latter.

<p>
Actually, there are EQ tests, but not in the format current testing you find 
with, say, Mensa.  Although EQ testing seems more subjective, it is just as 
objective as IQ determination.  How to test for EQ?  In a nutshell, certain 
<br>
'social' situations are discussed with you by an interviewer.  This <br>
interviewer may be a psychiatrist, (for example) who asks you to decide what 
you would do, or how you would act in specific social situations.

<p>
There are no right or wrong answers.  Now of course you could bullshit your 
way through it and give what you would infer are responses that would give 
you a high 'EQ', but since you undergoing the testing to hopefully help 
improve yourself, and find out ways to make your life happier, most 
respondents would very quickly realize that, except for their ego, they are 
only hurting themselves by giving a response that really is not the way they 
would act.
