<a name="0349qlink6">Of course, what all of this really means is simply that we software
engineers need to find better ways of creating programs.  Perhaps some
combination of evolutionary programming, advanced languages and expert
systems will allow us to write programs of the necessary scale without
running into fatal reliability problems?  At any rate, we need to get off of
our collective butts and start looking for real solutions.</a>
