I think I would try something like the party in Aristoi, with a huge
non-euclidean house with a wide variety of rooms subtly biased for
different uses through their design - figuring them out is part of the
entertainment, and with sufficient AI the building could change and
adapt depending on what people did. Like a huge puzzle or Rubik's
cube, with something for everyone. A big library to browse, classical
ballrooms, discos, lounges, places to eat, places to debate, a cellar
with chains and other implements... :-)

<p>
Of course, making something like this in virtual reality is the
sensible thing to do, so it would be fun to have it physical. Maybe a
big cube standing on a corner right in the middle of the sea (actually
held up by a diamondoid pillar, of course).
