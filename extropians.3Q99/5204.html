&lt;&lt; If I have offended anyone by my words I apologize. I hoped to gear an 
intellectual discussion. Obviously when confronting someone else's belief 
system, emotions come into play. Please do not flame me. I consider my life 
journey to be Extropian but I perceive myself to differ in the areas 
previously mentioned. How do others view these concepts?? 
<br>

<p>
I am not an objectivist, and I totally support your views, however others may 
feel.
<br>
Uploading and objectivism are only part of the picture. No requirements for 
membership, (other than than you are attracted to a positive view of 
technology and aren't particularly superstitious...  probably).

<p>
What I am attracted to is Extropic Art, life extension and positive optimism.
Cryonics and uploading don't thrill me. But I love science and art so here's 
a playing field where the both shall meet!! 

<p>
The objectivists are very vocal and share a need for rational thought and 
certainty that I find unlike my nature. ( Muse = 
artist-free-spirit-bleeding-heart-touchy-feely-feel-good 
-liberal-not-always-rational-and-emotionally-rambunctious person) Yet I have 
given the objectivists, libertarians and the hard science thinkers a good 
listen and I don't trash their views or scoff at them.  They at least are 
"thinking people". And I love thinking people... 

<p>
You are wise to say" don't flame me" - judging by the tone of this  list, but 
most of the  Extropians I know personally are rather polite. : - )
