<p>
We are pretty good with volcanos, not very good with earthquakes, and
pretty good with extreme weather.

<p>
Why would we want to? As far as I see they serve a very useful

<br>
They help scour away all those trailer parks and poorly built waterfront

property, ugly city structures, etc. Stupidity is a capital crime.

<p>
you would likely amplify its severity. Hurricanes and tsunamis feed off
of heat.. Now, if you could cool things down, that would be a help.

<p>
I don't think so.

<p>

<p>
Using lasers and other high energy beams we could tweak weather in
various areas, like we could have heated up the Pacific earlier this
year when La Nina showed up, and that would have helped abate the
hurricane season here, but generally severe El Nino and La Nina are good
for the US, we get more rain in western areas, not so much elsewhere.
