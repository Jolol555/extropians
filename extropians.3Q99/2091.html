<p>
I think the models now allow that the supernova may not blast planets
out of the system.  [One of our physics experts should be able to
compute the force exerted on a planet by the SN (at least from an
"energy impact" standpoint) and determine whether it can really
deflect it from orbit].

<p>
Since, there are models where neutron stars and/or white
dwarfs may suck matter from a nearby star, it is possible
that this could lead to a disk that might form planets.
[This seems iffy though.]

<p>
The planets could certainly be "collected" during near stellar collisions.

<p>
<a href="2083.html#2091qlink3">&gt; Is there any reason why the super-advanced would like be near pulsars?</a><br>

<p>
(a) They like devoting all of their energy resources to rebuilding their
<p>
    nanomachines damaged by high radiation levels.  Perhaps because life as an
    SI around a normal star gets boring and putting yourself in a high-rad
    environment has to make things a lot more difficult (i.e. exciting).

<p>
(b) The planet is an "off-the-neutron-star" communication station.  Neutron
<p>
    stars would in theory provide the densest "computronium".  I have no
    idea how you would get signals "in" or "out" however.  [What happens
    to photons hitting a ball of neutrons????].  Perhaps changes in the
    vibration or spin state of the neutron star are "read" by the planet
    and relayed to other ultra-super-intelligences (neutron-star computers).

<p>
(c) The planet has been placed there by the benevolent ETAI association
<p>
    to allow worm-brains like us who only have radio telescopes and
    haven't figured out high resolution visible spectroscopy to detect planets
    and go all warm &amp; fuzzy thinking about the possibility of an inhabited
    universe.
