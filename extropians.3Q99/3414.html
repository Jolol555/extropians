<p>
my inner geek rhapsodized:

<p>
<a href="3338.html#3414qlink1">&gt;The average ignorant abused white trash god fearing fucked</a><br>
up little
<br>
kid has no concept of nanotechnology-based surveillance,
command and control systems with direct access to their
brains.  In other words,
<br>
the Lord God Almighty.

<p>
... [snips]...

<p>
<a href="3338.html#3414qlink2">&gt;Then again, for the emotional catharsis of meek athiests</a><br>
who inherit
<br>
the earth, maybe some eternal suffering (~20 billion years)
for the
<br>
Christians.  And then time stood still: a single second felt
like a
<br>
day: 4 dimensional freeze frame, feelings included.  And
that
<br>
precious frozen moment: an ecstatic orgasm, a wonderful
breathtaking
<br>
vista of a mountain, lake, stream, field of flowers.  No,
it's that
<br>
moment in front of the tv, watching Al Gore or George Bush
with his
<br>
left hand on the bible, being sworn in to office, you're
holding the
<br>
phone, you just learned that your whole family's been
murdered by a
<br>
disgruntled Jesus wannabee.  20 billion years of that
moment.


<p>
[silence... gasps.... the audience bursts into applause!]


<p>
thank you, Ken.  When's your next reading?
