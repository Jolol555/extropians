Abstract
<br>
  The effect of negative air ions (NAI) inhalation by rats on
  energy reactions of mitochondria in homogenates of liver and
  brain was studied. The influence of NAI was investigated under activation of
  animals by administration of physiological dose of adrenaline. Adrenaline
  administration induced hyperactivation of the rate of phosphorylating
  oxidation of succinic acid in liver and brain mitochondria which was
  accompanied by oxalacetate inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) as
  well as excessive Ca2+ accumulation in liver mitochondria. These changes
  connected with a decrease of coefficient of phosphorylation efficiency ADP/O
  and uncoupler stimulation of respiration evidenced decrease of
  energy control of respiration in mitochondria. NAI
  inhalation diminished the rate of hyperactivated respiration and abolished
  excessive Ca2+ accumulation. These changes together with ADP/O coefficient
  and DNP stimulation increase evidence improvement of energy
  control of respiration which provide more moderate function of the
  respiratory chain under activation by adrenaline. Animals were excited by
  adrenaline administration. This effect was abolished by NAI inhalation,
  animals relaxed, some fell asleep. The data evidence sensitivity of
  mitochondrial processes in internal organs to inhalation of NAI and show
  participation of mitochondria in realization of physiological effects of NAI.

<p>
     It would be very interesting to see the effects of large doses of
  negative air ions in the setting of an old age home.
