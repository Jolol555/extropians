merely have a system that is 99.9% reliable - local monopolies and cartels
can occasionally form around unusual resource scarcities, but tend to be
short-lived in the absence of government intervention.</a>

IOW, the free market isn't perfect, but it works much better than any other
system humans have ever devised.</a>
