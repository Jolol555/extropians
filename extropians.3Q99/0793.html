I know we've got real rocket scientists here (I only play one on my 
computer), but I don't think this is right.  Why carry WINGS (and reentry 
tiles) to the moon?  (Even though that was an image I saw often enough in the 
science fiction art of my earliest youth -- on the covers of paperbacks that 
were already yellowing then.)  Which is not to say that the shuttle cargo bay 
isn't plenty large enough to carry a reusable translunar tug and an 
associated lander . . .
