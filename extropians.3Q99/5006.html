<a name="5019qlink1">Isn't your assessment of your audience *part* of the "simple honest
content" of any message that circulates in public?  If you indicate
disrespect for the sensibilities and concerns of the person you are
communicating with why shouldn't you expect them to be offended?</a>  And why
would you want to invite the inevitable infelicities of communication that
happen when people start getting defensive?

Even in the fabulous technofuture there will be a plurality of agents
contending for relatively finite resources.  Here's hoping that
politeness, however imperfect and frustrating a tool it seems to be,
remains in force -- without it it seems we will never transcend *social*
pains like humiliation and hostility.
