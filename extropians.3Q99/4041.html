You guys really are sheltered, aren't you?

<p>
Here's the relevant section of the M2F hormone therapy
faq (I apologize for the lack of formatting, but it is
a lot of data. Full text can be had at:
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.savina.com/confluence/hormone/">http://www.savina.com/confluence/hormone/</a>&gt;):

<p>
What are hormones, and how do they work?
Hormones are long-range chemical messengers of the
body, manufactured and controlled by the endocrine
system. Hence the title of endocrinologist for hormone
doctors. 

<p>
The hypothalamus produces gonadotropin-releasing
hormone (GnRH). This signals the anterior pituitary
gland to synthesize and release luteinizing hormone
(LH). To a lesser degree, GnRH also triggers the
synthesis and release of follicle stimulating hormone
(FSH). Subsequently, LH and FSH signal the gonads
(ovaries in females, testes in males) to synthesize
and release hormones that cause differentiation of the
body tissue into female or male form: estrogens,
progesterones, and testosterones. A small quantity of
testosterones are also produced by the adrenal gland.
Proportionally, females have more estrogens and
progesterones than males; males have more
testosterones. 

<p>
Estrogens include natural and synthetic estradiols,
estrones and estriols. They excite estrogenic
receptors, causing the body to differentiate into
female form and function. Natural and synthetic
estrogens are hereafter referred to simply as
estrogens. 

<p>
Progestogens (or progestins) are synthetic
progesterone analogues. Progesterones and progestogens
excite progesteronic receptors, which in cooperation
with estrogenic activity, cause the body to further
differentiate into female form and function. Natural
and synthetic progesterones are hereafter referred to
simply as progesterones. 

<p>
Various testosterones are collectively known as
androgens. They excite androgenic receptors, causing
the body to differentiate into male form and function.
Natural and synthetic testosterones are hereafter
referred to simply as androgens. 

<p>
Anti-hormones can be useful in transsexual hormone
therapy because they block hormone action or
production. The basic mechanisms are: 

<p>
Androgen receptor antagonist: blocks the action of
androgens at certain receptor sites. 
<br>
Androgen conversion inhibitor: blocks the conversion
of one type of androgen to another. 
<br>
GnRH agonist: Briefly overstimulates then effectively
suppresses pituitary LH and FSH production. 
Aggressive exogenous hormone therapy indirectly
reduces endogenous (natural) gonadal hormone
production by fooling the pituitary into thinking that
there are plenty of hormones already in the body;
consequently, the pituitary reduces the LH and FSH
signals that stimulate the gonads. 

<p>
Postnatally administered hormones do not cause
development of are opposite those born with. However,
postnatal contrasexual hormone therapy does cause
development of secondary sex characteristics as
described below. 


<p>
What are normal endogenous androgen and estrogen
levels?
<br>
The normal endogenous androgen range in a male is
300-1100 nanograms per deciliter. Estrogen is
generally below 50 picograms per milliliter. 

<p>
The normal endogenous androgen range in a female is
10-100 nanograms per deciliter. (within this range
lower numbers are not necessarily considered better;
remember, free-circulating androgens cannot bind to
receptors very well, and therefore cannot cause much
harm, if an androgen blocker is being used). 

<p>
There are dramatic cyclic and individual variations of
estrogen (estradiol + estrone) in females, with
100-400 picograms per milliliter being the most usual,
with 25-700 being possible depending on the
individual. 400 is considered a nominal "mid-peak"
(ovulation) level. 200-250 is considered a reasonable
target for exogenous estrogen treatment. Note that
only natural estrogens can be meaningfully measured,
so it you take any estrogen besides estradiol
valerate, estradiol cypionate, or estradiol, you will
not be able to accurately judge the results of a blood
test. 


<p>
What effect does female hormone therapy have on a
male, and how soon?
<br>
The longer after puberty hormone therapy is started,
the less effective it is--but not a linear scale,
e.g., results are considerably more dramatic in an 18
year old than a 28 year old, but results are not on
the average dramatically different between a 38 year
old and a 48 year old. 

<p>
The following effects have been observed in varying
degrees--anywhere from little to moderate--with
extended treatment. With effective and continuous
dosages, most of the changes that a particular body is
genetically prone to start within 2 to 4 months, start
becoming irreversible within 6 to 12 months, start
leveling off somewhat within 2 years, and be mostly
done within 5 years. The leveling may take longer if
the testes are not removed. High levels of estrogen
will cause faster development up to a point, but not
better results in the long term than moderate levels
of estrogen. 

<p>
Fertility decreases. Sperm count drops rapidly.
Sometimes it returns to almost normal if hormonal
treatment is discontinued within the first couple of
months, but permanent sterility can occur in as little
as six months. This should not be counted on for birth
control, because a miniscule sperm count might remain
until the testes are surgically removed. Estrogens,
progesterones, and gonadal androgen production
inhibitors are the chemicals responsible for lowering
fertility. It appears to the author that the other
types of anti-androgens do not necessarily effect
fertility--but one would be wise to take frequent
fertility tests if one chooses to employ only the
other types of anti-androgens with the intent of
maintaining fertility. 
<br>
Male sex drive decreases. Directly stimulated
erections can become infrequent and difficult to
maintain. Spontaneous erections usually stop. Semen
secretion decreases, usually resulting in less intense
ejeculatory orgasms (however, the ability to achieve a
satisfying orgasm--even with little or no semen--is
determined more by psychological factors and frequent
practice than anything else). The testes and prostate
atrophy. The penile skin also shrinks if erections are
not regularly encouraged. 
<br>
Breast size increases. Typical growth is to one to two
cup sizes below closely related females (mother,
sisters). The growth is not always
<br>
symmetrical--neither is it for females. Sometimes the
areoles and nipples swell, but generally not
significantly, unless the body is less than a decade
past puberty. 
<br>
Fat is redistributed. The face becomes more typically
female in shape. Fat tends to move away from the waist
and toward the hips and buttocks. 
<br>
Body hair growth (not including head, face, or pubic
area) slows, becomes less dense, and may lighten in
color. 
<br>
Many people also report the following effects, but
they are not verified in any medical literature that
the author has read: 

<p>
If exercise is not increased, some muscle tone is
lost. 
<br>
Outer skin layer becomes thinner, lending a finer
translucent appearance and increased susceptibility to
scratching and bruising. Tactile sensation becomes
more intense. 
<br>
Oil and sweat glands become less active, resulting in
dryer skin, scalp, and hair. 
<br>
Scalp hair becomes thicker, and male pattern baldness
generally stops advancing. In some cases, a fine fuzz
may grow back along the line of where scalp hair was
recently lost--but only from the living follicles, not
dead ones. 
<br>
Metabolism decreases. Given a caloric intake and
exercise regimen consistent with pre-hormonal
treatment, one tends to gain weight, lose energy, need
more sleep, and become cold more easily. Sometimes the
ability to concentrate is also initially diminished,
but the tiredness and distraction generally pass once
the body and brain become used to operating with less
androgens to maintain intensity. 
<br>
Fingernails become thinner and more brittle. 
Body odors (skin and urine) change. They become less
"tangy" or "metallic" and more "sweet" or "musky". 
Internal emotions are amplified, becoming more
apparent, distinguishable, and influential. Some
people report reduced anxiety and increased sense of
well-being. This could be a placebo effect. Changing
the hormone therapy (adjusting dosages up or down in
the regimen) sometimes causes a week or two of
depression and otherwise unexplainable emotional
angst. 
<br>
"Female" sex drive and enjoyment increase. This
observation is obviously completely subjective since
males have no way to directly compare the experience.
Non-ejeculatory orgasms become more likely for those
with the predisposition to have them, if for no other
reason than the fact that ejeculatory orgasms are
difficult or impossible to achieve, and the need for
sexual release forces a rewiring of perceptions and
responses. 

<p>
Female hormones do not: 

<p>
Cause the voice to increase in pitch. 
<br>
Dramatically reduce facial hair growth in most people.
There are some exceptions with people who have the
proper genetic predisposition and/or are less than a
decade past puberty. 
<br>
Change the shape or size of bone structure. However,
they may change the bone density slightly.

<p>
Anybody seriously interested in gender roles and
identity really ought to be looking at the transgender
community. Just about all the questions have been
discussed to a bloody pulp.
