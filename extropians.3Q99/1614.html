No mystery there.  That Enoch Root the prisoner was the child of
Enoch Root the soldier/priest, still unborn to the pregnant Julietta
Kivistik Root at the time of Father Root's demise.  The mystery
is who is Dr. G.E.B. Kivistik of page 82?  Was he Julietta's second
child?  I notice Stephenson keeps us guessing by never saying how
old Enoch Root the programmer/prisoner is, but there is no hint that
he is in his late 70s, which is how old he would need to be in order
to actually *be* the original priest.  Ideas?  spike
