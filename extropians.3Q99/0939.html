<p>
The shuttle plus payload is around 100 tons in orbit; delta-v to get
to lunar orbit is about 4.5 km/s total.  With LOX/LH2 at Isp of 455,
the mass ratio needed would be about 2.9, requiring 190 tons of
propellants not counting tankage and engines.

<p>
Since shuttle payloads are max about 25 tons, this would require
eight launches just for the propellants- only to deliver 25 tons of
usable payload to lunar orbit.  It would be far cheaper to develop
new vehicles from scratch rather than transport a shuttle to lunar
orbit.

<p>
If you want to return the shuttle to earth, it gets even uglier.

<p>
The best near-term way to get large payloads to the moon would be to
use Ariane 5 vehicles to put up a bunch of stages in LEO, dock them
together, then drop stages as needed along the way.  Cheaper, and
little new machinery need be designed.
