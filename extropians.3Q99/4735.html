The point we were arguing was whether the introduction of contraceptives
lead to more promiscuity or just to more people talking about sex (I'm
unsure how the latter might come about but I try to keep an open mind).
Ancient tribes/societies might be looking too far into the past for this
purpose.

<p>
Wouldn't those people 'down on their luck' be the first to migrate?  Thus
creating a nation of 'losers' rather than risk-takers.

<p>
The ones intelligent enough to run away stayed in Africa...?

<i>&gt;     due to the diseases they carried.</i><br>

<p>
Not to mention the murdering.
