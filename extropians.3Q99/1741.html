  We at SwingersUSA have been having standing room only parties for couples
since we opened a year ago. We want to give everyone the opportunity to party
  at our fabulous club and we have a great idea we would like to get your imput
<pre>
                                              on. 

</pre>
<p>
  Our plan is to have a party for gay-girls and gay-guys. We are debating which
    night to have the party. This would be free of charge for the first couple of
 parties and would be BYOB ( we provide soda, juice), after that their would be
  a fee. Since Friday &amp; Saturday nights are standing room only for the couples
 parties, it would have to be on a Sunday or a Thursday. We would like to have
<p>
    your imput on which day you think would be the better of the two. Please
   email venus@swingersusa.com and let me know which of the two days you
  think would be better and if you would be interested in attending this event!!

<p>
Thank you very much for your time and I hope to hear from you soon.
