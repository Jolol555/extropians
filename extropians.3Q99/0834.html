This thread is driving me crazy... I've got some explicitly Transhuman music
coming (and it's good in its own right), from my band The Land Canaan
(myself and the little woman, Jodie, ha ha, just joking, she's watching as I
type this)  along themes of mortality/immortality, changing yourself with
technology, uploading, and the idea that in the unknowable future we'll
still be 'us' in the kind of way that most would find important. There's
also more general human issues in there, the most focused on is change,
transition, leaving something and going to something new.

<p>
I didn't want too much before it was ready, but I just can't wait any
longer. The album is titled "On Leaving", and all material is ready, we've
just got to record it now. An initial recording (done at a cheap local
studio, more as a proof of concept) will be ready I hope within a month. A
more serious recording will be ready in about 3 months (costing damned mega
bucks in my opinion, but we've got to get it right). A web site should
emerge in the next couple of weeks with serious Transhuman content, to
preach to the converted (useful resources), but also to introduce the
uninitiated. Stay tuned...

<p>
In terms of PR, big budget movies, computer games, etc are overkill, and
only really introduce the ideas to people. I suspect that many people
already have been exposed to proto-transhuman memes, and are ready for more
directed effort that can actually be far more achievable than big-budget
mass-media handwaving. How many of you were "converted" by transhumanism,
and how many found that it merely provided a vocabulary for beliefs you
already held?

<p>
I have a plan, which comes directly from the dark, tainted vaults of PR and
marketing. Any interest?

<i>&gt;     Computer games simply don't hit the right demographics in my humble</i><br>
<i>&gt; opinion (not -yet- anyway.)  If one were to drop a big chunk of change on</i><br>
<i>&gt; a</i><br>
<i>&gt; development project, I really feel that the movie option is the way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; go...</i><br>
<i>&gt; in some ways the computer game would be preaching to the converted...</i><br>
<i>&gt; (12-30</i><br>
<i>&gt; year old males, wired, early adopters of technology, in -general-)  And to</i><br>
<i>&gt; tell the truth, even an overt transhuman theme in a computer game would</i><br>
<i>&gt; not</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguish it from the pack-- for instance, Alpha Centauri already has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'transcend' victory path...</i><br>
