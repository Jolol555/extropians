Marvin said, "I'd don't care if it's directed at me, you are wasting *my* time, so please leave so someone with more intelligence can ask a real question."  Or words to that effect.

<p>
Having participated in panel type discussions in time limited conference
settings, I will have to side with Minsky. Such a discussion is not like
the 'smoke a bowl at the frat house and blather on about existence' type
of discussions that too many people prefer to use as their elocution
models. When you get the mike, ask your question and SIT DOWN. Someone
who monopolizes with reworded or other secondary and unimportant
questions is the one being rude.
