<a href="2724.html#2965qlink1">&gt;Lets take a straw poll, how many people in the group</a><br>
<i>&gt;were "outsiders" as children, e.g. played mostly alone,</i><br>
<i>&gt;had only a few friends, or were generally rejected by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the social cliques that educational system produces?</i><br>

Sure, that would be me. Not at all in the States, interestingly enough, but
as soon as a moved to the UK (when I was 11) I might as well have renamed
myself Pariah. I never did fit very well into the educational system either,
although I had a couple of outstanding teachers along the way - an English
teacher who was more than happy for me produce reams of science fiction, and
a Physics teacher who loaned me a copy of Godel, Escher and Bach when I was
14 spring to mind.
