<p>
In a thread concerned with violence (the subject of this one), I don't think
that anyone needs to "sneak in" discussion of circumcision. After all,
prepucectomy (AKA male genital mutilation, or removal of the foreskin) most
definitely constitutes a violent act -- especially since it often occurs
without the use of anaesthetics.

of its sex organ (without anesthesia) could spend time in prison. Yet doing
the same to a baby boy entails no penalty.</a> It seems to me that
"circumcision" really involves some deep-seated hatred of male sexuality.</a>

<p>
<a name="4923qlink1">Note also the complete absence of any studies to determine possible
psychological effects of this traumatic experience.</a> Disregard for male
sexuality permeates Western civilization to such a degree that no one even
cares to investigate the matter.
