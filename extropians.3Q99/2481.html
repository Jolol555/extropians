<a href="2453.html#2481qlink1"> &gt; Because nobody, no one person, has the right to subscribe the whole list</a><br>
<i> &gt; to some other list, except the extropian list owners. If you are the</i><br>
<i> &gt; person who did so, please understand that what was done is as rude,</i><br>

Mike,  I don't think they did this.  All that I think they did was send
a single poorly worded invitation to join the egroup to the extropians list.
All subsequent traffic has been in response to that poorly worded
invitation or more significantly, their responses to our responses
and/or their inability to remove themselves from our mailing list.

<p>
I would defend on freedom-of-speech grounds and the concept that
extropians should be "inclusionary" vs. "exclusionary" their right
to send an invitation to the group.

<p>
Your message and Craig's fairly hot responses point out the degree
to which we are jumping on people for violating a "code" which they
may have no knowledge of, which in fact thay may not have "violated".

<p>
IMHO, this is "very un-extropian".  And while I'm extremely guilty
of this behavior from time to time, it is only when we point it out
to each other thant we may have an opportunity to consider it and
if appropriate modify the knee-jerk reactions.

<p>
Investigate, *in detail* first, then crucify as necessary.
