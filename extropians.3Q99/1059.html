<a name="1072qlink1"><a name="1061qlink1">How are federal governments equiped to tax alternative incentive 
systems, such as virtual reality with direct brain stimulation?</a>

<p>
Instead of exchanging money for goods and services, we may be 
exchanging digitized sensations.  Furthermore, the exchange may be 
completely wireless.  In this case, how would a government extract 
wealth from the process of one brain exchanging digitized experience 
with another brain?</a>

<p>
<a name="1061qlink2">In this type of economy, how does an artist or teacher pay federal 
property taxes or income taxes, when the exchanges are exclusively 
experiential and private in the most sensually intimate sense?  When 
this type of technology arrives for the general puplic, the 
government will have to switch from the role of zookeeper/prison 
guard to the role of agent facilitating the dismantling</a> of the old 
agencies.

<p>
<a name="1061qlink3">How do you visualize this process actually occuring without there 
being a stage of general amnesty from government prosecution?</a>
