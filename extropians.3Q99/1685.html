<a name="1688qlink1">I have made myself quite wealthy through entrepreneural</a> efforts and
investing and would be very interested in working with anyone in this
group who has an idea or project of business merit.  

<p>
Eliezer is correct that ideas are a dime a dozen in there raw form but
it is also true that if handled properly a fair percentage can be made
to produce profits and benifits beyond money.  Both the idea person and
the person that helps convert the idea to a business or product can
develope a nice comfortable stream of income given even a few average
hits.  One golden product can set someone up for a very large windfall.

Any interested parties can contact me personally at

I hope I haven't offended anyone with this off topic post.
