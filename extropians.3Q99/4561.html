Yes.  But I'm not telling!  Not yet anyway.  I just got a part in a SF
film.  I play the mother of the lead (well, his young).  The images are
absolutely beautiful!  The director is known for his photograph approach to
cinematography.  When the Web site is up, I'll make an announcement. His
particular style is much different (filmically) than the films mentioned in
previous posts.

<p>
As far as "look," the cover of Scientific America is quite alluring as well
as the cover of Popular Science (article: Body of the Future) and also The
Face magazine.

<p>
We may be looking inside out rather than outside in.
