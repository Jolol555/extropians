SPOILER for Cryptonomicon, although the plot is so confusing that it
doesn't give away anything significant.

<p>
Enoch Root's death was faked.  From page 542:

<p>
"The doctor stops in at the courthouse to drop off the death certificate.<br>
Otto and Julieta go on ahead to the cafe.  Bobby Shaftoe loiters outside,
staring back up the street.  After a minute or two he sees Rudy poke his
head out the door of the doctor's office and look one way, then the other.
He pulls his head back inside for a moment.  Then he and another man walk
out of the office.  The other man is wrapped in a blanket that covers
even his head.  They climb into the Mercedes, Blanket Man lies down in
the back seat, and Rudy drives off in the direction of his cottage."

<p>
The man beneath the blanket was obviously Root, as he was the only person
in the clinic besides Rudy.
