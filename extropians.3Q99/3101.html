<a href="2959.html#3101qlink1">&gt;&gt;There is some religious organization called Baha'i here in Denver</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;hosting a Debate between Evolution and Creationism.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I'm not sure which side they're on so I sent them an email.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2959.html#3101qlink2">&gt;Baha'i is a religion. It seems like a rather mild type of cultish</a><br>
<i>&gt;christianity, but I don't know much more about it. I'd hazard a</i><br>
<i>&gt;guess and say they are either creationists or perhaps even</i><br>
<i>&gt;in-betweeners.</i><br>

<p>
The Baha'i are a group that originated in what is now Iran in the
1850's. They are very progressive for a religion, in fact one of
their tenets is the idea of progressive revelation. The Baha'i also
have a tenet of the essential unity of science and religion, they
have a saying "science without religion is materialism, but
religion without science is superstition."

<p>
The Baha'i temple outside of Chicago is one of the most beautiful
buildings in town, be sure and see it if you get the chance....

<p>
The Baha'i are very friendly, it should be a good discussion.
