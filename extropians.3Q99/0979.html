<a name="1015qlink1">There is much we don't understand about Mars.  But the last thing to
assume is that mysteries are explained by the activity of intelligence.
This is the same point I made earlier with regard to attempts to
explain missing mass or missing neutrinos by invoking intelligence.
Experience has shown that we do best to exhaust all possibilities based
on natural explanations before we conclude that intelligence was involved.</a>

<p>
<a name="1015qlink2">In the case of the examples you listed, many of these points were made
by Hoagland on the basis of the Viking orbiter photos, and some of them
have been basically refuted by the new pictures.  We have good images
of the main pyramid and the upper part of the D&amp;M pyramid.  There is no
buttressing, and the facets are not precise and never were (they don't
meet at a point, for example).<a name="1015qlink3">  We have good images of most of the "City"
</a>
</a>
and it all looks natural.<a name="1015qlink4">  We have the western portion of the "Fort"
</a>
and it looks natural as well.<a name="1015qlink5">  We don't really know what the Face looks
</a>
like when viewed from the surface, but the early reconstructions based
on Viking cannot be trusted now.

<p>
<a name="1015qlink6">I don't see anything here which can't be plausibly explained by natural
processes of erosion.  We have pyramidal rocks on earth, and even
mountains and hills that resemble faces.  Obviously the details of
erosion will be different on Mars, and there are still many unknowns.
But we should explore natural explanations and not jump to the conclusion
that unexplained phenomena are due to intelligence, just as in other
forms of scientific investigation.</a>

<p>
<a name="1015qlink7"><a href="0958.html#0979qlink2">&gt; It's interesting that you don't think it's prudent to "waste money" (a </a><br>
<i>&gt; myth--we've already got a craft there ready to take pictures</a> without costing </i><br>
<i>&gt; anything)</i><br>

<p>
<a name="1015qlink8">It's not a myth that there are huge costs to image and re-image this area.
The cost of anything is the foregone opportunity.  There is only a limited
amount of bandwidth available for returning pictures, time on the deep
space networks necessary to pick up the transmissions, time to plan the
pictures and to process them when they come back.  When we take another
picture of the Cydonia region, we're missing out on the opportunity to
photograph some other part of Mars.</a>

<p>
There are scientists all over the world clamoring to have their favorite
part of Mars photographed.  Volcanoes, valleys, polar caps, plains, each
type of terrain has scientific interest.  If the scientific community
demands more pictures of Cydonia, fine.  To my layman's eye it does look
like an interesting region.  But I am not an areologist.  We should leave
it to the experts to decide what should be photographed.  These people are
the best judges of how to use the exteremely scarce resources we have
available for photographs.

<p>
<a name="1015qlink9">Another thing to consider is this.  Suppose we did take more photos of
Cydonia, and we saw what we have seen so far.  The rest of the D&amp;M pyramid
looks like an eroded outcropping.<a name="1015qlink10">  Same with the Fortress.  Same with the
</a>
other structures.  The Face looks vaguely facelike, but no more so than
any number of natural landforms on the earth.  What then?</a>

<p>
<a name="1015qlink11">Would that satisfy you?  Would you then say, okay, no more pictures?</a>
<a name="1015qlink12">If so, what about the others, who aren't satisfied?  Some people
will continue to see hints of structure in the photographs.  Look at
Hoagland's web page at www.enterprisemission.com.  He saw all kinds of
stuff, castles and streets, in the photos from last year.  Others will
agree with him.  Do we have to keep taking pictures until every last
person on Earth is satisfied, at the cost of scientifically useful
photographs from other parts of the planet?  Or do we simply stop when
you personally are convinced there's nothing there?</a>

<p>
In other words, how can we allocate scarce photographic resources in a world
where the vast majority of the scientists do not think the artificiality
hypothesis is at all convincing given the data available, but there is a
small but vocal minority who insist that it be investigated?  How would
you propose to resolve these disagreements?
