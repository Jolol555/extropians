Actually, I can see how it could be read that way, but I was specifically expressing
discontent with the level of rigor possible in economic and political theory. There are
some fairly hard formulations about the general optimality of free markets, which is
encouraging; but a lot of writing on political theory seems very arm-wavy to me. Maybe
there's something really great and hardcore out there that I haven't read? It seems more
likely that human politics is just inherently fuzzy.

Depends on where you go. Austrian economics, at any rate, has some footholds like Chicago,
and of course up the road from me at Auburn. I imagine it's still true that if a classical
liberal wackojob joins a randomly-selected PoliSci department, he'll be isolated.

<p>
Well, actually, in some ways "token wacko" is nice work if you can get it :-)
