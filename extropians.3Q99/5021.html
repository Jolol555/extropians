The only instance since the Prohibition era in which a fully automatic
weapon was used in a crime (where someone was caught or convicted) that
I can find is the killing of a Mr. Hileman, a suspected drug dealer, by
an off duty police offier Waller, in Dayton Ohio. This crime is the
basis for the 5th circuit appeals court ruling Searcy v. City of Dayton
which held that the Chief Law Enforcement Officer which signs the Form 4
ATF transfer papers for a Class III automatic weapon is not liable for
any crimes committed by the transferee, as the CLEO is merely stating
that to the best of his/her knowledge, the transferee has not committed
any crimes in the past. Officer Waller shot Mr. Hileman accidentally
with his MAC-11 machine gun during an episode where Officer Waller was
attempting to 'make a buy' while off duty to establish evidence that the
person and the residence were drug outlets as part of a volunteer
anti-drug program.
