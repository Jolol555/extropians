They don't need to be.  In Anders' scenario it takes an exhaustive medical 
examination to tell whether someone is affected, which means that it takes 
an expert to interprete the test results.  This is a nearly insuperable 
problem, because:

  <li>  You don't know how many of your experts can be trusted.
  <li>  You don't know which of your own bodyguards you can trust.
  <li>  If you go into a roomful of medical equipment maned by subverted 
doctors, you are going to come out under mind control.

So far as I can see, the only viable solution is to let that 'provably 
non-subverted' segment of the military Anders mentions take over 
temporarily while they test everyone.  Unoftunately there is no way that a 
democratic government is going to do that - most of the subverted leaders 
will object, as will many non-subverted leaders who simply don't trust the 
military.  It is also worth noting here that there is really no way you can 
ever convince a suspicious observer that a given group of people is 100% 
free of mind control - no matter what the situation is, you can always come 
up with some scenario in which they could have been infected.
