I will concur Ralph.  It just happens to be an approximate starting
point.

<p>
Given that there are multiple P450 enzymes with varying specificities
for different molecules and multiple polymorphisms within those enzymes
I would assume this to be the case.

<p>
Francis Collins has noted that every individual has ~5-8
significant genetic defects.  Nobody is completely immune.
Some defects happen to interfere with eating, others
with activity, others with biohazards, etc., etc.

<p>
<a href="2766.html#2780qlink3">&gt; It is also interesting to look at the UN report on toxic exposure levels</a><br>
<i>&gt; across various countries. The vary quite a bit. </i><br>

<p>
A good point.  Afalotoxin (sp?), a fungus that grows on peanuts
(and is carcinogenic, in part because it will mutate a specific
critical base in the p53 gene), is at relatively low levels in
the U.S., but is responsible for significant amounts of cancer
in China.

<p>
This raises the *fundamental* problem with genetic variance,
"equality", safety regulations and a host of other factors.
Should all children in a playground be required to play as
"safely" as a child with one of the various blood clotting
genetic defects?  [Perhaps so that the child with the gene
defect is not made to feel "disabled" or "handicapped"???]

<p>
Should all consumers be required to pay the expense of
"special" food or "special" food processing techniques
or "natural/organic" food because there are individuals
in the population who are disadvantaged due to the genetic
lottery?

<p>
[Ralph, I hope you undertand that I am strongly sympathetic
for the problems you have to deal with due to this situation.
I just feel that the proper solution is *not* to impose
generic solutions to this problem on the general population.]

<p>
Just as I have to watch out for a car dealer selling me
a lemon, I should have to watch out for a restaurant
serving me foods high in phthalates if I am sensitive
to them.

<p>
The solution in the AgBio-GeneTherapy debate is for the
"organic" growers and the ag-purists to be paying the
bill to certify their questionably scientific perspective
(just as a person with a clotting defect has to pay the
price of "playing safer") -- the solution is *not*
to impose those costs on people who disagree with those
perspectives (as would be the case if foods had to
be labeled "genetically engineered", causing consumers
who didn't know anything about science to boycott them
in fear that they represented a risk).  This is the same
cost the people with normal blood clotting would be
forced to endure if they were required to follow
minimal-likelyhood-of-accident play practices.
