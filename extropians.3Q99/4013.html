I agree that such confusion exists, though it is NOT merely social
conservatives who want that confusion to be accepted as the way things are.
A lot of self-proclaimed feminists want to make feminism to be merely their
kind of feminism -- as opposed to a multifaceted movement in which some
individuals might even be opposed to others.  Also, many in the Left want
collectivist feminism or radical feminism to be seen as true feminism, while
individualist or libertarian feminism are portrayed are sell out feminism.

<p>
(BTW, some of you might want to check out the Randian-Feminism list.  See
<a href="http://www.uio.no/~thomas/lists/randian-feminism.html">http://www.uio.no/~thomas/lists/randian-feminism.html</a> for details on it.)

<p>
This all works together as one system because on a lot of basic assumption
social conservatives, radical feminists, and Leftism agree.  One of these is
a collectivist view of humanity.  All of these ideologies tend to put
individuals into categories and like to work with them that way.  Another is
<a name="4015qlink1">statism.  Most social conservatives want to shove their moral agenda down
everyone's throats in the same way that most radical feminists want special
treatment, subsidies, and men to be punished (which amounts to using the
government to bludgeon other people), and the Left (with few exceptions)
wants to use governmental power to enforce whatever is in currency as social
justice at the moment.

<p>
<a name="4022qlink1">Minor quibble: I would not paint Rush Limbaugh as part of the "Guns and
Gawd" crowd because he is not necessarily pro-gun rights.  I also believe
</a>
that social conservatives, on the whole, are not pro-gun rights.  At best,
they either see gun rights as a traditionalist issue -- they're for guns
because they've always been for them -- or, more pragmatically, because they
do not yet control the government.  When and if they do, I bet they will
turn anti-gun because they won't want anyone else to have an armed means to
resist their power.
