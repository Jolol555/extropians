Wrong. Saturn's moon Titan is about the same size as Mars (actually a
little smaller), yet has an atmosphere THICKER than earth (by several
times). The natural atmospheric density of a single earth sized world is
actually that of Venus. Ours is so thin because we have such a huge moon
to yank at the atmosphere with its tidal influence. Informed opinion is
that Mars could manage a 1000 millibar oxygen/nitrogen/co2/CFC based
atmosphere given a few hundred years of hard work. We could create an
800 millibar CO2 atmosphere with just 30 years work.

<p>
<a name="2430qlink1">The surface of Mars is several hundred times larger than the Australian
Desert, so of course the desert would be cheaper. Come up with a fair
comparison why don't you. Then again, since the Australia project would
probably be delayed for centuries and go into cost overruns because of
legal and protest action by environmentalists, not to mention the
inefficiency of a socialist government, Mars might actually be cheaper.</a>

<i>&gt; 6 months to reach mars.</i><br>

<p>
Wrong again. since distance = (accelleration x time^2)/2, a one g trip
would take a few weeks at most, depending on the relative positions of
the earth and Mars.

&gt; 4.  There is no infastructure, and no one to live with.<br>

<p>
North America had no infrastructure when the europeans got here. Now its
the most developed area on earth.

<p>

<a href="2408.html#2429qlink4">&gt; 5.  Everyone benifits from teraforming, no matter who pays.</a><br>

<p>
Only those who go to mars benefit directly. The human race as a whole
benefits, however, in that Mars is an insurance policy against the earth
being hit by a comet or asteroid, or killing itself with a nuclear war.
Not to mention that the technology of terraforming will also be the
technology for eliminating effects of the greenhouse effect if it gets
out of control.

<p>

<a href="2408.html#2429qlink5">&gt; 6.  No one on earth will allow the transfer of oxygen.</a><br>

<p>
You must be joking, nobody could possibly be this stupid
intentionally...

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2408.html#2429qlink6">&gt; 7.  A teraformed planet may require matenance.</a><br>

<p>
Of course, but the maintenance is easy: plenty of aerosol spray cans,
some orbiting mirors, maybe. Possibly even land all of our weapons grade
plutonium on one of Mars' small moons and build a huge IR heater
unit....

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2408.html#2429qlink7">&gt; 8.  It is too big of a project for any corporation or nation to pay for it.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2466qlink1">To give it a big boost all that is required is a few comet diversion
missions. The added heat and evaporated gasses will give a big boost to
the system, especially if they are dropped on the poles.</a>
