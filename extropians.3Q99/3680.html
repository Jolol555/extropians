Emlyn, while I agree that this is an interesting idea, I suspect
that it doesn't work out in reality.  The Amazon.com discount
from the publisher is significant (probably varying with the
publisher), while the affiliate kickback from Amazon is quite
small.  You probably also would annoy your publisher significantly
if you set yourself as being in competition with them.

<p>
The only solution ultimately is for authors to self-publish.
I've discussed this with Robert to a limited degree and this
may be what happens with Xenology (a very old book Robert
wrote about the "science" of finding &amp; studying "aliens"
that has yet to be formally published).

<p>
However, Nanomedicine is caught between the period when
publishers are required and not-required (i.e. the only
"useful" purpose they serve is as "accredited" reviewers
(from a libertarian standpoint).

<p>
In theory it would be completely possible to self-publish
Nanomedicine, but it would not receive the publicity that
an organization such as Landes Bioscience can give it.
That strategy would probably result in a failure to penetrate
the market that is trying to be reached.
