Quoting Bryan Moss:
<br>
<a href="3443.html#3662qlink2">&gt; Parents are the weak link in our chain; we need to remove them as early as</a><br>
<i>&gt; possible and replace them with someone who has a genuine (economic) interest</i><br>
<i>&gt; in the child.  To begin with the best we can do is offer good money for</i><br>
<i>&gt; children, soon after we might contract women to give birth to wholely owned</i><br>
<i>&gt; children, and eventually we would grow them in labs (or farm them if you're</i><br>
<i>&gt; looking for an appropriate visual image).  I want child welfare to be an</i><br>
<i>&gt; systematic process of our economy without interference by parents who expect</i><br>
<i>&gt; more than dividends.</i><br>
<pre>

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ If thats not advocacy for 'inbred fealty to
</pre>
the state welfare apparatus', then I don't know what is... furthermore:
You said:
<br>
<a href="3443.html#3662qlink3">&gt; &gt; The local data and expertise is fairly crucial, as the micro-loans program</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suggests, as is collective responsibility.  The kid could not be forced to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; honor the contract later on, but it would probably be very much in his</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interest to do so, as his share value would be a bankable asset in getting</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; loans or future investments.  He would no more be likely in most cases to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; disallow the original contract than any corporation would be to basically</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; commit suicide and let the share prices go to zero.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
And Bryan said:
<br>
<a href="3443.html#3662qlink4">&gt; I would suggest that the child can be forced but it would, in most</a><br>
<i>&gt; circumstances, not be in the best interest of the share holders.</i><br>
<pre>

^^^^^^^^ This is advocating that children be taught to not honor their
</pre>
contracts.
