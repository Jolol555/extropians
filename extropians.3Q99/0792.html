Spike,

<p>
Maybe you can help me here.  I was trying to remember the other QM demo
from college physics in which the beam is passed through a slit or pair
of slits that are vertical, thus screening out all the side to side
waves or particles, then through a slit or pair of slits turned 90
degrees .......and then it all gets foggy in my mind.  If I remember
right it ends up that the particles still have the same intensity as if
they had never passed through the first slits, etc.

<p>
Anyone who can jog my memory on this, or the name of the demo would be
much appreciated.

<p>
Lee
