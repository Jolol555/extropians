<p>
my two cents:

<p>
First of Lee didn't make this shit up, it's pretty damn basic.
I think basically, nothing is wrong with taking personal responsiblity for 
one's own feelings, and control over -- or lack of control -- over them. 
Choice. 

<p>
It's a pretty beasic Zen Buddhist principle.

<p>
<a name="5093qlink1">Second, when he started bagging on "politeness" he pissed everyone off.</a> 

<p>
Third: 

<p>
I believe, that one  can take responsiblity for one's own reactions AND be 
polite.
 
<p>
If and only if, one comes from a position of loving,<a name="5077qlink2"> basing your reaction (or 
non-reaction) on empathy -- in that honest reaction.</a>
Otherwise you're just being a smart-ass who say's "I don't give a damn about 
what you're saying, you can't effect me" ..or something like that. Which is 
not just impolite, it's condescending and cold.  And callous.

<p>
So come with love, brothers and sisters, listen and care what others do, be 
concerned about their motive, and if someone hurts you, squeal out loud!!! 


<p>
love and poodles,
