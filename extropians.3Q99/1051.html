IMHO, it might be a big letdown.  The structure, from what photos I've seen,
don't look all that interesting.

<p>
Mars has a lot to offer, but, for now, it's expensive to get there and do
geology.  However, if I was given the chance to choose one target
specifically for study, it would NOT be the so called face.  It would most
likely be Mariner Valley (forgot how to spell the Latinized version:) or the
poles or Olympus Mons.

<a name="1056qlink1">But to move the discussion to another level, why do you believe there might
be alien ruins there?  What sort of sifting to you do ahead of time to
</a>decide that?  I'm asking this in a general way because there are plenty of
enigmatic features all over the solar system.  And only so much time and
effort that can be devoted to any of them.  Now, if there truly were some
alien race that left some stuff behind, I'd rather get to that stuff first.
(Not that I believe that.  I believe there are no alien remains anywhere in
the solar system.)

Cheers!
