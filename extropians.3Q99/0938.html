No offense, but that's quite a bit of an exagerrated comparison.

<p>
Adding some additonal fuel cells as a small payload package
would be a relatively minor retro-fitting.  Besides 19 days
is already plenty of time for the shuttle to get to lunar
orbit and back.  So it already has the power capacity to
sustain itself on a short (3-5 day) lunar orbit mission.

<a href="0933.html#0938qlink3">&gt; And it would be absurdly inefficient and far more expensive than building</a><br>
<i>&gt; a real lunar vehicle from scratch. Why bother?</i><br>

<p>
I think that is open to more rigorous analysis. But I
suspect you're right if we want to make lunar travel
*routine*.  I was simply arguing that it wouldn't be nearly
as difficult as most beleive to turn the shuttle into a
lunar transfer vehical.
