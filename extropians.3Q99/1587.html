<p>
You're being far too anthropomorphic.  It doesn't make a damn's worth of
difference whether or not AIs are raised permissively or harshly, they
can't possibly get a "taste for blood", and I'd be seriously surprised
to ever find two AIs with the same architecture and conflicting goals. 
<br>
<a name="1589qlink1">"Parenting" isn't going to help at all.  All of these things rely</a> on a<br>
base of human emotions that won't exist in an AI.

<p>
I suggest:
<br>
<a href="http://pobox.com/~sentience/AI_design.temp.html">http://pobox.com/~sentience/AI_design.temp.html</a>

<p>
The sections you want are "Interim Goal Systems" and "The Prime Directive".

<p>
This should give you some idea of what the inside of a first-stage AI's
mind is likely to actually be like.
