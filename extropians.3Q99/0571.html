This is a good point.  SIs could colonize everything *if* they
wanted to.  Even humans could do it without nanotechnology if
the launch costs get low enough and enough people want to do this.

<p>
Since we still see stars (assuming the Universe is not a TV screen),
then they don't exist or don't desire to colonize (everything).
That implies that it isn't to their benefit to colonize everything
(just as it is not to our benefit to separate all the rocks from
all the barnacles).

<p>
I believe this has a lot to do with speed of light delays.
There is a measure of parallel processing performance called
the logP model, that I won't go into the details of here.
The model however allows you to compare the performance of
various parallel processors taking into account network bandwidth,
time to access the network, CPU speed, etc.  Think of an
M-brain saying "I need more computational capacity".  So send
a nanoprobe over to the nearest star with instructions to build
another M-brain, great, that gets you 2x your current processing
capacity.  But you get killed in the logP analysis because of
the delays passing the data back and forth between the M-brains.

<p>
Consider what would happen to your "mind" if you moved the neurons
a foot apart, a kilometer apart, an astronomical unit apart.
Your computational throughput is going to slow down significantly.

<p>
The only solution is to put the stars *very* close together
(but not so close as to collide or produce a black hole).
Well, this architecture sounds a lot like a "globular cluster"
(hundreds of thousands or millions of stars in the space of
a few hundred light years).  GCs have stars that are metal-poor,
implying they are either very old (and natural) or perhaps
relatively young but the metal has been artificially removed.
If true, you have one "activity" that SIs do -- strip stars
of metals for comutronium/memorenium construction and dump
the H/He back into the stars for further processing.

<p>
My favorite theory of M-brains says that they hide the stars,
but there may be some architectures [esp. long term memory
storage units] where you have little use for the energy but
metal (C/Fe/etc.) is in really short supply.  What I don't know
at this time is whether or not the masses of GCs significantly
exceeds the estimates from the visible stars.  If this were
true then visible GCs are the hard drives or tape backups.
There might be "hidden" GCs that would be the Super-SI CPU
"clusters" that think about really "long-term" problems
(sure, the LogP parameters are poor (inter-CPU times of weeks
to months), but they are better than a single-SI and you've
got billions of years anyway).
