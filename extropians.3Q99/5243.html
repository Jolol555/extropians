<i>&gt; or are you chasing contracts?  Don't make us wait for the web site!</i><br>

<p>
We have several projects cooking away, but the only one I can talk about
now is the X-1 replica- we're proposing to build an updated XLR-11 engine
for a fully functional, flying X-1 rocket plane.  Some other folks are
setting up a nonprofit organization to pursue the development of the
replica, and we'll bid competitively with anyone else for the propulsion
contract.  (There are several custom fabricators who could build the
airframe of the bird, but the rocket is the tricky part.)

<p>
Of course, with the research we've already done, documentation in hand, a
borrowed museum engine available for reference, and the assistance of the
guy who refurbished the last few engines for the X-24 project back in the
70s, we doubt if anyone else could beat us...

<p>
This engine could also be useful for other markets (sorry, that info is
NDA'd), and we could easily scale it up or down after the initial
development.  I came up with a really slick fabrication technique which
should reduce the parts count and number of welds significantly, and we
have several other tricks up our sleeves.

<p>
I'm designing our test stand while everyone else does business management
things, and we should have it complete in December (I've done this job
before, so it's easy).

<p>
Some specs for XLR-11 engine as used on the X-1:
4x 1500 lbf thrust chambers
<br>
LOX/ 80:20 ethanol/water propellants
<br>
1.5:1 OF ratio
<br>
250 psi chamber pressure, pressure fed tankage
Sea Level Isp- 220 s

<p>
We'll probably make several changes in the updated design- different
materials for the chamber, 99% isopropyl alcohol fuel, better nozzle shape,
a more efficient (&amp; cheaper) injector design, and a longer nozzle for
starters.  These would add up to 30 seconds to the Isp (and could go over
300 Isp in vacuum with a larger nozzle). Improvements to ignition and the
entire valve system would improve operability and reliability- and of
course, no Ulmer leather seals!

<p>
We have seed money, but do need to get some contracts or investment.  The
next couple of months should be exciting.
