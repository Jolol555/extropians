<i>&gt;					-The Times/ London</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; INTELLIGENT FABRICS could be the key to craft travelling</i><br>
<i>&gt; outside our solar system. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nasa will next month announce a $6m project to build the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world's largest telescope, using an inflatable smart fabric it is</i><br>
<i>&gt; developing. The space agency is also working on another</i><br>
<i>&gt; smart fabric that could be used to make huge solar sails to</i><br>
<i>&gt; take spacecraft into other solar systems. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The idea is to make the spacecraft as big as possible, says Art</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chmielewski, manager of the new Gossamer Spacecraft</i><br>
<i>&gt; Initiative at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena,</i><br>
<i>&gt; California. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Everyone talks about miniaturising spacecraft and having lots</i><br>
<i>&gt; of tiny satellites working together," he says. "We looked at</i><br>
<i>&gt; that and found that for looking very far away, or travelling</i><br>
<i>&gt; huge distances, size does matter. The bigger the craft, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; faster you will travel and the further you will see. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; challenge is to make the craft as light as possible, allowing it to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be launched cheaply." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chmielewski believes the best way to make a craft light is to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make it inflatable. His team is working on a project that would</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow a space telescope the size of a football field to be folded</i><br>
<i>&gt; and launched from a craft the size of a coffee cup. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Existing materials aren't up to the job - if you made one of</i><br>
<i>&gt; these telescopes from glass 1mm thick, it would still weigh</i><br>
<i>&gt; about four tonnes and break easily. We have to develop</i><br>
<i>&gt; something that can inflate itself to become solid and stable. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "A lot of work on inflatable craft has been done, but nothing</i><br>
<i>&gt; on this scale. We want to create craft the size of a city that</i><br>
<i>&gt; are far lighter than today's craft." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chmielewski's Advanced Radio Interferometry between</i><br>
<i>&gt; Space and Earth space telescope (Arise) would be launched</i><br>
<i>&gt; on a standard Delta rocket. It would unfold and inflate itself in</i><br>
<i>&gt; space to form a 25-metre diameter telescope able to study</i><br>
<i>&gt; black holes and other phenomena in greater detail than Hubble</i><br>
<i>&gt; or Nasa's planned Hubble 2. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Arise is a technology testbed," he says. "Once we perfect the</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology, we can make telescopes that are far larger and</i><br>
<i>&gt; can even change their shape over time. For instance, we hope</i><br>
<i>&gt; to build a smart fabric that can change its shape, which could</i><br>
<i>&gt; be used as the lens of the telescope. Once the image is</i><br>
<i>&gt; received, the craft can check for any image problems and</i><br>
<i>&gt; automatically change its shape to correct them. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "At the moment this is impossible and we have to manipulate</i><br>
<i>&gt; images with a computer on earth. By allowing the craft to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; this itself, we can save a lot of time and greatly improve the</i><br>
<i>&gt; image quality. It's a way of allowing the craft to fix itself if it</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes wrong." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Another of Chmielewski's projects is to develop a smart fabric</i><br>
<i>&gt; that could be used as a huge solar sail, allowing it to be pushed</i><br>
<i>&gt; by the solar wind at high speeds. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Chmielewski says this could eventually be the way we power</i><br>
<i>&gt; spacecraft fast enough to take us outside our solar system.</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Solar sails are not a new idea, but our work is on developing</i><br>
<i>&gt; materials that actually make them usable," he says. "For</i><br>
<i>&gt; instance, one of the things we are working on is a kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt; fabric that not only forms the sail, but also the computing and</i><br>
<i>&gt; communication system. It will do this by containing tiny</i><br>
<i>&gt; electronic components that actually form part of the fabric.</i><br>
<i>&gt; This allows us to develop a craft that can actually change its</i><br>
<i>&gt; mission and evolve over time - if it is made from smart fabric,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it can change its shape easily. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; "This will also have uses back on earth and we are already</i><br>
<i>&gt; talking to companies about creating intelligent clothing like a</i><br>
<i>&gt; shirt with a mobile phone built into it." </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nasa is sponsoring a two-day meeting next month to get more</i><br>
<i>&gt; ideas for future missions. Chmielewski says: "We're interested</i><br>
<i>&gt; in slightly wacky ideas. One thing we have just started looking</i><br>
<i>&gt; at is a system where we use only a tiny ribbon of material that</i><br>
<i>&gt; we spin round to form a disc, which then becomes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; telescope lens. We have no idea if it will work, but that is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of idea we are looking for. The Gossamer project is not</i><br>
<i>&gt; really about missions we can do now, but about finding</i><br>
<i>&gt; concepts and ideas for missions in 25 years." </i><br>
