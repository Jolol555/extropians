in
<br>
<a href="2716.html#2734qlink2">&gt;  that it is forbidden to infringe on the perrogatives of the national</a><br>

<a name="2749qlink1">    one thing: whats to stop the first group along from claiming a vast 
majority, if not all, of the land in the possession of the national 
government? how do you decide who gets what land, in the case</a> of simultainous

territory-claim model?</a>

to

<p>
<a name="2749qlink3">    it seems that in order to guarantee that a locality can not force ppl to 
stay put, the national gov must be prepared to use force against the local 
governments if they try to prevent the citizens from leaving. this</a> sounds a 
<a name="2749qlink4">lot like a basis for a national bill of rights and an accompanying police
