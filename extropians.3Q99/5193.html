US govt, are you listening? You are losing business and IT
workers because of your orwellian policies. You are losing
money because of regulations -- non-productive regulations
even...

If only the US didn't have these rediculous rules, I might
consider living there. After all, most of the "cool stuff"
IS done in the US</a> :(
