Oh, yeah, terribly funny.  I find it hideous to know that even being an
Extropian is no defense against an organic brain malfunction.  I really
wonder whether being an Externalist Singularitarian would be enough.

<a href="1520.html#1522qlink2">&gt; Yeah, but doesn't it make you seethe not to be part of the A-list? I mean,</a><br>

One guess who *was* on the first list of contactees.

<a href="0641.html#1522qlink3">&gt; Or in other words, given the known fact that at least one set of saucer</a><br>
<i>&gt; experiences is the result of hallucinations, it's easier to hypothesize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that your own personal experiences - never mind other people's - are</i><br>
<i>&gt; false, than to hypothesize that aliens would behave in such weird,</i><br>
<i>&gt; pseudo-anthropomorphic ways...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But the really weird, and really frightening part, is that when the</i><br>
<i>&gt; brain malfunctions in that way, it usually becomes impossible for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; person to accept that vis experiences are hallucinations.  No matter how</i><br>
<i>&gt; ridiculous, no matter how perfectly conforming to the standard report of</i><br>
<i>&gt; schizophrenia, the victim simply becomes unable to wield Occam's Razor.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Someday, when drugs are developed that can temporarily induce</i><br>
<i>&gt; schizophrenia or similar disorders, with an absolute guarantee of no</i><br>
<i>&gt; long-term side effects, I'd like to try it out - very briefly -</i><br>
<i>&gt; myself(*).  I'd like to see if my mind is sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt; software-reengineered to remain sane despite massive perturbations;</i><br>
<i>&gt; failing that, it could be useful to know the first symptoms of</i><br>
<i>&gt; malfunction, in case something ever goes Really Wrong.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But what it truly is, I suppose, is sheer curiosity; the desire to face</i><br>
<i>&gt; a challenge; the need to know one's own mind; the same reason people are</i><br>
<i>&gt; so intrigued by split-brain experiments.  Who's the actual master of my</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind?  Is it really me, or am I just a surface veneer of rationality</i><br>
<i>&gt; laid over deeper forces that just happen to be cooperating?  Do all my</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard-held mental disciplines work just because nothing else is opposing</i><br>
<i>&gt; them at the time?  Organic insanity is the ultimate opponent, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; without facing it, there's no way I can ever really know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; (*)  No, I'm *not* looking for a rematch.</i><br>
