The new batch of cards is *completely* different- they are:

<p>
Batch 1    Batch 2
<pre>
KJKQQJ     KQJKQ
HCSDCD     DSHCH

</pre>
<p>
Thus the queen of hearts in the first batch is replaced by the queen of
diamonds in the second batch, king of hearts with the king of diamonds, and
the jack of clubs is not replaced at all, thus giving one fewer cards in
the second batch, and no duplicates.

<p>
NONE of the cards in the first batch are in the second batch.  Pure
flimflam- the whole thing is just a joke played on the gullible.
