<a href="1486.html#1516qlink1">&gt; Hello Emlyn and Eleizer,</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I admit the notion of a beautiful woman who can punch holes in concrete </i><br>
<i>&gt; excites me too!!  In Star Trek-The Motion Picture it was the veeger copy</i><br>
<i>&gt; of </i><br>
<i>&gt; a crew member named Illya who literally smashed her way effortlessly</i><br>
<i>&gt; through </i><br>
<i>&gt; a door when she grew impatient.  Now would you want a girl like that in</i><br>
<i>&gt; your </i><br>
<i>&gt; life?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; sincerely,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

John, I think you are giving me credit for this thread where none is due (if
you were just saying hi, then right back at ya!). I have been meaning to add
my meaningless opinion to this thread though.

Women punching through walls? Well, I like Buffy, but Xena, now there's a
woman...
<br>
/end alert

I've kicked a hole in a wall by accident, it's all too easy. If you are
talking strong, sci-fi type walls (metal?) then that's another story.

<p>
If Jodie (my dear wife) could punch through walls, that might be useful, as
we both forget our keys relatively often. Or maybe it might be a bad idea -
we usually get in somehow, and those repair bills might get expensive!

(a woman who could fix the wall again afterwards, hmm, that's got
something...)
