Perhaps the most important thing my father ever said to me was to give me the 
advise not to go into the buggy whip business when the automobile was about 
to be invented.  I can imagine his reaction to the above quote: "Right --  no 
carriage maker will EVER build a self-propelled vehicle; it would put the 
carriage industry out of business!"  Seriously, a self-replicating "anything 
box" will certainly put the MANUFACTURING industry on its ear, but will only 
make the DESIGN industry all the more profitable, because the demand for 
diverse and clever product designs will skyrocket.  Who will want to sell 
"anything boxes"?  DESIGNERS will.
