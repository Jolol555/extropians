Fortunately, it isn't up to me.  But the adoption of new technologies IS 
helped or hindered by how the law perceives and accommodates the risks 
presented by new ways of doing things.  This was the subject of a paper I 
presented at the Spring, 1998 Foresight Institute Senior Associates 
gathering, "Tiny Torts: A Liability Primer for Nanotechnologists":

<p>
      <a href="http://users.aol.com/gburch3/nanotort.html">http://users.aol.com/gburch3/nanotort.html</a>

<p>
This brief and very basic paper generally discusses how the common law of 
torts has evolved and adapted to the introduction of new technologies.  What 
you will find there is the comforting knowledge that in fact the common law 
has developed principles by which introduction of new technologies is not 
only possible, but is actually ENCOURAGED by common law tort concepts such as 
the "reasonable person", "foreseeable risk" and "state of the art".

<p>
In this regard, I would note (as I have before) that non-lawyers should not 
draw conclusions about how the legal system works from accounts in the 
popular press.  Journalists succeed by selling sensational stories, such as 
the huge products liability verdict against GM mentioned, or the famous 
McDonald's coffee burn case.  What DOESN'T get reported is the vast majority 
of the cases in which manufacturers use the standards found in the law to 
defend the reasonable steps they've taken to develop and market sound new 
technologies.  (Likewise, the reasonable workings of the appellate system 
aren't usually reported, so that the papers don't cover things like the 
eventual outcome of the McDonald's case -- in which all but a small portion 
of the original damage award was overturned -- or, more importantly, where 
important new rules excluding "junk science" from trial courtrooms have been 
developed.)
