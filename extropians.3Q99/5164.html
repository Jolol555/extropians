No need to reinvent the wheel, I have better tech, I just don't
need to use it for something as simple as E-mail. This particular
machine has run all day for 10 years without ever a problem.

<p>
I get a point, this machine is ancient, but does what I need it to
do.

<p>
Why replace something that works with something new that is buggy?
Why not save a few bucks and invest it?

<p>
If thats all you have why not, It's like Gallagers crack about the
sledge-o-matic " it makes mashed potato's and it makes french
fries, but you have to hit that sucker just right......."
