<a href="1114.html#1129qlink1">&gt; Well, not that orbital mechanics is all that useful for Earthbound folk,</a><br>
<i>&gt; but</i><br>
<i>&gt; I have noticed that lots of intelligent people in the computer field --</i><br>
<i>&gt; people who can analyze problems, create elegant designs and solutions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; even</i><br>
<i>&gt; anticipate defects and usage -- do not like or cannot do mathematics about</i><br>
<i>&gt; an algebra level.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any ideas on why this is so?  Can it be rectified?  Should it be</i><br>

<a name="1190qlink1">Writing skill apparently is more important than mathematical skill to a
programmer (this comes from software engineering lore, maybe I can find a
reference, but only if it is really wanted because it would be a very
annoying and not very enlightening task). The kinds of thinking used to
structure a report or an essay are apparently very similar to the kinds of
thinking used to structure a non-trivial software system. This still begs
the question of why documentation written by IT people is so piss poor, but
that is a question for the SIs.</a> Of course if your system is about
mathematics then you'll need a math brain, but probably only one, compared
to X many people who can cut support code thats got nothing to do with
maths.

<p>
Anderson Consulting here appears to recruit people from law and the
humanities to be IT consultants, and trains them in coding itself. Being a
software engineer myself (that's crapspeak for a code cutter who also does
pretty pictures in MSWord), I doubt the efficacy of this, but it's their
money.

<p>
If it were me, I would hire talented magicians. I think that slight of hand
is highly underrated as a prerequisite for system design &amp; implementation.
Also people with a family history of winning the lottery (genetic luck)
would be a damned good choice.

<p>
But they'd still be crap at maths.
