It's more than memory, although that alone would be a very big deal

after a while the tone still sounded but the shock no longer came, the wild

<a name="3490qlink3">To quote from the article " transgenic mice are quicker to learn to disassociate
the previously paired events". You can't do that with improved memory alone.</a>

<a name="3490qlink4">Speaking of memory, this is the clearest indication yet that Long
Term Potentiation is memory, or at least a good part</a> of it is .
<a name="3490qlink5">It's been shown before that slowing down LTP over what's found in
nature hurt memory, but this is the first time it's been shown that
speeding it up helps memory. That alone is worth a Nobel Prize.</a>

<a href="3449.html#3484qlink2">    &gt;I'm very surprised that Science let the article go</a><br>

<p>
<a name="3490qlink6">The article explains what changes were made to the mice and how
they were made,  then they report on how the modified mice did
when they took several standard tests, what is your objection</a> to that?
<a name="3490qlink7">By the way, the article is in Nature not Science.</a>
