<a name="1053qlink1">As you know, the Mars Global Surveyor is circling Mars in its mapping 
capacity.  In April of '98 it returned a series of three pictures of the 
Cydonia region, site of the alleged "Face."  On July 8 this year it returned 
another hi-resolution shot taken of the "City" area in Cydonia, and so far as 
I can tell it's equipped and ready to take even more shots of some of the 
more interesting formations within the next few months--or even days.</a>

<p>
<a name="0702qlink1"><a name="0692qlink1">The processed images of the Face have produced a wealth of evidence 
consistent with artificiality, though the controversy is far from over.</a>

I think we'd be well-served if Malin Space Science Systems (NASA/JPL's space 
camera contracter) got some encouraging email from interested groups who 
_aren't_ bogged down in conspiracy theory.  This is not "The X-Files," but a 
very touchy and completely falsifiable hypothesis which needs</a> further 
exploration.

<br>
(www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html) and Dr. Stanley McDaniel <br>
(www.mcdanielreport.com) for background information.</a><br>
