<p>
Are quadruplegics the same people, even if their body-image 
is going to the dogs? Are people with anaesthesized spinal 
cord still people or not? That's an experiment which is easy enough to 
try. 

<p>
A hard validation would be a whole-head graft, which has been
successfully done with animals. They attempted to vocalize/bite the
experimenter (which is not very surprising -- I think in their place 
I'd try that, too). For some strange reason (duh), this has not been 
tried with people yet.

<p>
There are certainly individually distinct low-level motorics 
present in the spinal cord -- however, these can be learned 
or even convincing surrogates be installed in their place -- 
after all, ressurection does require nontrivial level of technology.
