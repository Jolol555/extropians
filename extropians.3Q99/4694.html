I thought saving yourself was just good Christian values, that's what the
born-again-ers seem to think.  I'm not sure about people being more
promiscuous then (pre-contraception) than now since I have no evidence

either way but I very much doubt it.

When my mother took away my BB gun I sure felt like hurting someone.

<p>
Well, the eyes are sensitive to green so all that foliage could have some
sort of effect, the diversity of smells, sounds, etc, might do something for
us.  The problem of tracking the animal might be rewarding.  Beyond the
hunters own interpretation of what he or she is doing can you suggest why
hunting is a unique relief that can't be gained any other way?  Wouldn't
cross country running without a map be equivalent?
