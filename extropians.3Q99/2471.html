Uh, nope. I've never been too fond of this version of antimatter, but here's
how it works.

<a name="2476qlink1">  <li>  A particle of normal matter is moving forwards through time, minding its

  <li>  That collision 'bounces' the particle back in time. It continues on, but

  <li>  The particle is involved in another collision, which bounces it forwards

So what we see in that case is a particle interaction in which two particles 
are created, one of matter, and one of antimatter. After a short time, these 
two particles collide and annihilate, and some other particles are produced
from the annihilation energy. But to the particle in question, it just
appears to be going around an infinite loop, where its time direction is
reversed at each collision point.
