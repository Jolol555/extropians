<p>
The Internet is watching your every move. Web sites pelt your browser with
<br>
``cookie'' Þles that store information about you. You've told total<br>
strangers your name, address, age, income and marital status, all for free
e-mail accounts and contests. No less an authority than Scott McNealy,
chief executive of Sun Microsystems, said this year: ``You have zero
privacy anyway. Get over it.''

<p>
You don't have to get over it. You can get around it.

<p>
Several software products, some free, let people disguise their identities
online so they can surf without giving up their personal data. These
products help consumers delete privacy-invading cookies and serve up bogus
identities to Web sites that are avid to know all about them.

<p>
``For the Þrst time, you can feel like you're online and don't have a<br>
camera over your shoulder,'' said Dov Smith, spokesman for Zero-Knowledge
Systems, a Canadian software Þrm with privacy protection software being
prepared for release.

<p>
The new products work in different ways. Some let people surf by using
servers at remote locations as intermediaries, scrambling the user's true
identity. Others put encrypting software onto the users' computers.

<p>
The new tools are called ``privacy enhancers,'' said Jason Catlett,
president of Junkbusters Corp., a New Jersey consulting Þrm that makes one
of the free software products.

<p>
The products are necessary, advocates say, because of the way people freely
shed their privacy online.

<p>
``The Internet has developed as an intimate medium, more than the U.S. mail<br>
or the telephone,'' said Robert Ellis Smith, publisher of Privacy Journal
in Providence, R.I. ``They communicate with the screen and think it's an
opportunity to exchange sensitive information without repercussions. They
think the (information) will be protected. People are shocked to discover
it isn't.''

<p>
People may post a question or comment to an Internet newsgroup, unaware
that this ``tentative, unedited thought . . . will be archived and can be
retrieved,'' Smith said.

<p>
As Zero-Knowledge's Smith puts it: ``If you're 14 years old and you post to
a newsgroup, `My parents just put me on Prozac because I'm depressed,' that
comment is there, and any moderately Internet-savvy future employer or
insurer or date can go to the site and get the statement. And that's just
the tip of the iceberg.''

<p>
Smith of Privacy Journal said the Internet has even made window- shopping
something that can be tracked. ``Never before has it been possible to keep
a log of when you handle the merchandise,'' he said. ``All of that can be
recorded and exploited later to reach you in your home.''

<p>
That's where privacy enhancing software comes in. The leading examples of
this new breed are:

<p>
-Web Incognito from Privada (www.privada.net): For $5 a month, this
software from San Jose's Privada compartmentalizes and encrypts various
information so that no one can make a connection between a Web identity -
the name, password and personal data you give to Web sites - and a
real-world identity. Cookies - the Þles that Web sites store on your hard
drive to track your movements and remember your passwords - are stored on
Privada servers.

<p>
-Anonymizer (www.anonymizer.com): Anonymizer, a company based in La Mesa
(San Diego County), offers a free eponymous product and a beefed-up version
for $14.99 per three months. Anonymizer is entirely Web-based, meaning
there's no software to download; users surf to sites through the Anonymizer
site, which masks their identity and deþects any cookies.

<p>
-Freedom, from Zero-Knowledge Systems (www.zeroknowledge.com):
Zero-Knowledge is a Canadian company whose þagship product is still in
beta-testing mode, with a $49.95 version due out next month. Freedom is
software that sits on the user's computer and sets up a pseudonym for Web
surÞng, e-mail, newsgroup posting, Þle downloading and many other online
activities. Zero- Knowledge also supplies encryption software for Freedom
users to many small to midsize Internet service providers, for extra
security.

<p>
-Junkbuster (www.junkbusters.com): Junkbuster software sits on a user's
computer, and works between the browser and the Internet, throwing out
cookies and other information that the user doesn't want revealed.

<p>
Many of these Þrms also maintain comprehensive Web sites referring users to
other products, resource guides, more Web sites and books on privacy
protection.

<p>
Lumeria, a Berkeley company, has a similar product in the works. Lumeria's
Super ProÞle will be an ``infomediary,'' which lets users selectively sell
information about themselves to marketers and guard their privacy at the
same time.

<p>
Fred Davis, Lumeria's CEO, said Super ProÞle will let users decide which
cookies to keep in a ``cookie jar,'' and it will give a fake IP address and
fake information about surÞng habits to Web sites that try to place
unwanted cookies. Davis called the tactic ``Cookie Doe,'' and he likened it
to ``a bulimic agent that tosses its cookies.''

<p>
Privacy protection software is not yet big business. Junkbusters Corp.
gives the software away, which helps promote the company's consulting
business. Privada and Zero-Knowledge want to make money by selling their
products, but the software is still in beta and not yet commercially
available for downloading. (Privada is for sale on CD only, with the
download coming soon.) Even so, Privada CEO Barbara Bellissimo reports
70,000 visitors to her site in the Þrst month.

<p>
Anonymizer CEO Lance Cottrell hopes that by giving away a limited version
of his product, users will want to buy a more comprehensive version. He
said 100,000 people use the free version of his product, while less than
10,000 people have bought the enhanced version.

<p>
``That's a tiny, tiny fraction of the potential market size,'' Cottrell<br>
said. ``People are just becoming aware of these issues.''

<p>
Each time a security þaw is exposed in Microsoft software, he said, or
Amazon.com reveals what employees at various companies are buying, people's
awareness of the power of online data collection grows.

<p>
``People want to control their personal information on the Web,'' said<br>
Privada's Bellissimo. ``There's a segment of people on the Internet who
don't know what can be obtained without their knowledge, but there's a huge
segment that aren't even on the Internet because of their fear of losing
their privacy.''

<p>
The Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington, D.C., organization
that advocates for civil liberties in the digital age, maintains a Web site
that offers a glimpse of the kinds of information Web sites can gather on
surfers. Click on the word ``You'' at snoop.cdt.org, and you'll see your IP
address (which could give a potential hacker a head- start on Þnding out
who you are and what you're doing online), the type of browser and
operating system you're using, and other information such as your Internet
<br>
<a href="2519.html#4906qlink1">``host'' and your e-mail address.</a><br>

<p>
Often, people simply give away information about themselves, unaware that
it can be combined with this other technical data to form a powerful market
research tool.

<p>
Of course, if you sign up for one of the privacy enhancement services, you
have to trust that company.

<p>
Privada said it can't tell who's doing what using its service, but it does
know who has signed up. If a law enforcement agency brings a subpoena,
Privada can install a ``monitor'' so it could track a user's activity.

<p>
Zero-Knowledge's Smith said his company's name speaks to its commitment to
users: ``We don't know anything about you, and we never want to.''

<p>
More than mere technology, protection of privacy will also require
government's passing new laws, as well as self-regulation by Internet
companies and users.

<p>
``No single technology can solve all the problems,'' said Ari Schwartz, a<br>
policy analyst at the Center for Democracy and Technology. ``And on a
global medium like the Internet, no technological solution can work on its
own without some sort of policy.''


<p>
TURNING DOWN COOKIES, CREATING PHONY IDENTITIES

<p>
People concerned about online privacy can take matters into their own hands.

<p>
Fred Davis, CEO of Lumeria, offered some tips for protecting privacy online.

<p>
You can go into your browser's preferences Þle and turn off cookies, but
you soon will discover just how many sites require that you accept a
cookie. Plus, privacy advocates note, there are cookies that users want to
accept, such as those that remember a password and save users the trouble
of retyping it each time they visit a site.

<p>
Davis recommends that you never give your true identity when signing up for
something online. If you're an old man in Northern California, perhaps you
want to sign up as a young woman in Seattle. (But be careful: I gave a
bogus ZIP code when I signed up for a free Internet fax service and wound
up with a number in the wrong area code. When I tried to sign up again, the
service wouldn't let me - it had placed a cookie on my browser and knew I
was back for more.)

<p>
Another way to mask your identity is to set up free e-mail accounts, like
those available at a portal site (such as Yahoo or Excite) or at Hotmail,
and use them in identifying yourself around the Web.

<p>
``The public is concerned, and yet they still go around the Net and Þll out<br>
the correct information on forms,'' Davis said, shaking his head in
disbelief. ``People are honest.''


<p>
PRIVACY RESOURCES

<p>
A number of Web sites offer extensive information about privacy online,
including:


<UL>
  <li>  Electronic Frontier Foundation: www.eff.org/pub/Privacy

  <li>  Electronic Privacy Information Center: www.epic.org

  <li>  Center for Democracy and Technology: www.cdt.org/privacy

  <li>  Internet Privacy Coalition: www.privacy.org/ipc

  <li>  Lumeria: www.privacyplace.com, launching next month.

  <li>  TRUSTe: www.truste.org

<p>
PROTECTING YOUR PRIVACY

<p>
New privacy protection services prevent data - such as a user's e-mail
address - from being transmitted to Web sites. How they work:


<UL>
  <li>  Ordinarily, data þows uninterrupted between a user and the Internet
through an Internet service provider (ISP).

  <li>  A privacy protection service encrypts the data from a subscriber's
computer and redirects it after it leaves the ISP. The service masks the
data's origins and sends it on to its intended destination. Responses from
Web sites and e-mail þow back to the service, which passes them back to the
subscriber.
