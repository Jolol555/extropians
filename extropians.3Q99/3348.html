I know where you are comming from and I agree that there should be a 
philosophy of "being".  But it is more important for me at this present time

<p>
to make sure that I'll survive.  After I've achieved immortality (putting 
aside getting hit by a super nova, etc.) than I can work on those ideas.  Of

<p>
course if you want to come up with some a reason for being I'm all ears.  I 
just love life!



<p>
Now, leaving aside the technical details of whether it is really
feasible, let us *assume* that survival is guaranteed.  It does seem
like that is a distinct possibility (ignoring the probabilities).
So lets say we are surviving in whatever enhanced form and perfect
environment we have choosen.

<p>
Who says that survival is guaranteed ?
<br>
Taking it as an assumption for your argument is pointless because survival
will NEVER be guaranteed.

<p>
This is why I am interested in transhumanism - because I want to survive
whatever comes my way.
<br>
I want to evolve into something that is capable of protecting itself should
some other SI/alien race come along and decide to turn my little planet into
mass for it's dyson sphere (for example).
