<a name="2543qlink1">Tipler found a solution in General Relativity that shows that an
infinitely long, extremely dense cylinder made of Neutronium (the stuff of
Neutron Stars)</a> and spinning at almost the speed of light would be able to tip
a light cone enough to act as a time machine and allow you to visit the past,
but there are two very important problems.


<OL>
  <li>  Nobody knows if a cylinder of finite length would work also, the math is
   too difficult to figure out.

<a name="2543qlink2">  <li>  The very rapid rotation would cause the cylinder to fly apart. This is
   much more than just an Engineering difficulty, no known force in Physics
   would be strong enough to hold the cylinder together, not even the strong
   nuclear force.</a> For this to work new Physics would need to be found, which
   is just another way of saying that as far as we know now it's impossible.
