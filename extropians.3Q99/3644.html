Hello,

<p>
I see the memes of extropianism getting into the mainstream no matter what 
the government may do.

<p>
<a href="3527.html#3644qlink1">&gt;The 'powers that be' are going to stomp us flatter than dried elephant</a><br>
<i>&gt;shit unless we take care.</i><br>

<p>
But at the same time I think rather then being "stomped" to death we well be 
along with the general public REGULATED to death!!  And with powerful home 
A.I. and nanotech they will have good reason to do this.  You think the 
federal government has too much bureaucracy now!!  Whether this can be done 
fairly unobtrusively and without totally violating civil liberties will be 
interesting to see.

<p>
John Grigg
