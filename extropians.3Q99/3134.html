<a href="3129.html#3134qlink1">&gt;I get the impression that you're just trying to quarrel because you</a><br>
<i>&gt;disagree with me; I'd prefer if you attack my ideas and not my &gt;knowledge</i><br>
<i>&gt;because even if I'm not an expert in Satanism you know perfectly well &gt;what</i><br>
<i>&gt;I mean. If do you want to know, I'm an atheist and,</i><br>
<i>&gt;although I'm not an expert, I do understand a bit about Satanism.</i><br>

<p>
Quarrelling is the last thing I want to do.  I admit I may have come on a 
bit strong.  For that I apologize.

<p>
I have noticed that I lot of people shutter when they hear the word 
satanist.  Satanism is actually a mock of Christianity -in name anyways.  
They believe in respect and not giving people respect who don't give it to 
them.  They are very much for justice and reality.  Satanists are atheists 
in that they don't believe in God (or Satan).  They are their own gods and 
they worship themselves.

<p>
Satanists do have some parts of philosophy I don't agree with which is why I 
don't consider myself a Satanist.  I do like their saying "Stupidity should 
be painful!" :-)

<p>
The reason I brought this up is so people would be a little more educated 
about some of the basic philosophy and not use it as an evil symbol to make 
an inaccurate point.  I'd trust a Satanist before I'd trust a Christian.  At 
least you know what to expect from a Satanist.

<p>
<a name="3140qlink1">I do see the point you are trying to make though.  And I agree with who ever 
said that parents should be allowed to raise their children to believe what 
they like.  After all, as adults they can change their programming.  I did.</a>
