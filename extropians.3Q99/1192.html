<a href="1187.html#1192qlink1">&gt; You say that almost like it's a bad thing. I'd certainly like to be God</a><br>
<i>&gt; and</i><br>
<i>&gt; with a little training I think I'd be very good at it, I just need to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; the job.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
That explains something that's been nagging at me. The big guy seems quite
fallible for an omnipotent being. I reckon we got the work-experience
(intern?) SI on the case; maybe we are the crappy training ground for gods,
where they get their experience and make their mistakes, then move onward
and upward to greater career heights, leaving behind the mess for the next
trainee.

<p>
..."Where's that lightning bolt again? Oh there it is (*fumble*)... shit,
now I've set them on fire, how about a little rain to put that out, wait a
second, woah, now the place is flooding. SSI, am I in trouble! Wait a sec,
I'll just fudge the logs a bit, rub out that bit about piety, add a bit of
guff about irreverence and worshipping false idols... there, that'll do the
job. Now, there's the off switch, we'll go for a nice round number, 37, 38,
39, 40 - stop. Wait, where's the population, oohhh, there they are, floating
around... whip those out, eeyeww, I'll just take a few out of this tank over
here... 

<p>
How do I explain continuity? A big boat, that'll do the trick. I'll just
grab some of the backup flora &amp; fauna, mmm, there's not many of those left.
Better tweak the gene pool to make it work (can't get caught out on that one
like that SI on Rigel IV, woah, he was busted big time, monkeys almost
ascended on that little mess-up). Now I'll feed in the false memories to the
new subjects, pipe in the historical logs for their cultural memory, and
voila!

<p>
Crap, I hope I get that job out on the rim soon. This damned planet's such a
kludgy mess, and too many millenia on this legacy DNA system is gonna sink
my career like a stone. I don't want to end up like those guys working on
the 4 humors based system on Alpha Centauri; now there's a melancholic bunch
of immortals if ever such existed.

<p>
I'm so bored, I think I'll do a bit of system hacking, scrawl my name in the
logs. Lets see what they think 'o' that one, ey. Hey, you irreverant carbon
slime, here's a pestilence for your trouble! Damn it, what do you mean my 30
uses are up, I hate shareware punishments! Like your getting 25
enlightenment tokens out of me buddy, like hell! I'll just have to make
do... Where's the bloody lightening bolt? Oh, there it is (fumble)"...
