<p>
    i say just systematically replace each neuron with an improved synthetic 
counterpart, that functions exactly like the neuron it replaced, untill all 
neurons have been replaced, at which point ya press the "intiate godmode" 
button . the synthetic neurons should be able to communicate at faster speeds 
then the organic version, and also should be able to function completely in 
binary, so an i/o jack could be integrated, allowing the addition of, at 
minimum, more nodes, outside of my head. thats when things get really funky...
<p>
    did i botch the above description? i mean, the above approach seems to be 
the only way i can think of to upload in a nondestructive way. with that 
approach, it doesnt matter of consciousness is pattern-based or causal-based, 
because the chain of interaction would be preserved. each synthetic neuron 
should have pseudonormal synaptic connections (to connect with organic 
neurons that are not replaced yet) and an improved synaptic connection (to 
connect to the synthetic neurons; these synthetic synapses wouldnt go online 
till the whole system has been upgraded, to preserve consciousness in case 
its a global emergent property). maybe they could be optical; whatever works 
best. who knows. am i understanding this right?
<p>
    but, if eliezer is successful, ill be reduced to my component atoms long 
before anything like this happens. mission: blackmail eliezer into becoming a 
neurologist and working on methods of nondestructive neuron replacement. ;)
