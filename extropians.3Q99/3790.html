someone asked what is New Zealand like. Here are two recent political
speeches from the ACT (association of citizens and tax payers): on of four
substantial political parties in NZ. gives yo an idea from a fairly
libertarian point of view just what the country is like now, and what it
might become,

SPEECH TO CANTERBURY UNIVERSITY
<br>
12.00 noon Thursday 9th September 1999

<p>
HON. RICHARD PREBBLE, MP
<br>
LEADER OF ACT NEW ZEALAND

<p>
FREEDOM AND CHOICE  -  THE REAL ISSUES


<p>
Thank  you  for  the  invitation to speak at Canterbury University today.
Your
<br>
letter of invitation states:

<p>
"Please  feel  free  to  speak on a topic of your choice, although students<br>
are
<br>
most  likely  to be interested in tertiary education issues such as fees,
loans
<br>
and allowances."

<p>
I  think that sentiment expressed the real issue of this election.  I will
come
<br>
to  tertiary  education,  fees,  loans  and allowances  -  let me deal with
the
<br>
first  statement:  Feel free to speak on a topic of your choice  -  freedom
and
<br>
choice.

<p>
The  ACT  Party's  whole raison d'être is freedom and choice.  The ACT Party
is
<br>
the  only  party in Parliament that believes that you should be free to
choose.
<br>
Of  course there are limits, but in essence the limitation is that with
freedom
<br>
to choose comes responsibility for your actions.

<p>
ACT  says  adults  must be held responsible for the foreseeable consequences
of
<br>
their actions.  If your actions cause harm and loss to your neighbours then
you
<br>
should make good.

<p>
A society that is based on the belief in your right to choice must cherish
free
<br>
speech,  must  uphold  the  sanctity  of contract and the right to own
property
<br>
and,  provided  you  are liable for consequences, the right to do what you
like
<br>
with your own property.  If you can't, you don't own it, the state does.

<p>
Only ACT in Parliament believes that you should have the freedom to choose.

<p>
This election is a choice of the school teacher or the mother telling us
what's
<br>
good  for us, taking our choices for us.  The school teacher Helen Clark
versus
<br>
the mother Jenny Shipley.

<p>
Why  any  educated  person, why any person who wants to be free to choose
would
<br>
vote for either is a mystery.  All the other parties are just imitations of
Jim
<br>
Anderton's  belief  in  the  collective, that the state should and can take
our
<br>
property and make choices for us.

<p>
Today  in  New  Zealand the state takes 40% of all that we earn every year.
We
<br>
keep  just  60%.    The  state  in income tax, GST, fuel taxes, duties and
user
<br>
charges,  takes just under 40%.  That's more than the state took to fight
World
<br>
War  II.    It's  more  than  the state took in the sixties.  Up until 1973
the
<br>
state,  in  New  Zealand, never took more than one dollar in four, now it
takes
<br>
more than one dollar in three.

<p>
To  listen  to the media you would have the impression that New Zealand is
some
<br>
sort of wild west capitalist state  -  nothing could be further from the
truth.

<p>
To confiscate by law more than over one dollar in three of everything
produced,
<br>
requires  police  state  powers.   The IRD can enter your home without a
search
<br>
warrant.    The  IRD  can  access and empty your bank accounts  -  and does
-
<br>
without a warrant and no court can stop them.

<p>
By  law  you  earn what the Inland Revenue Commissioner says you do.  You
can't
<br>
challenge that ruling until you have paid half of the tax that the
Commissioner
<br>
says   you   owe.     Under  this  Government  the  Commissioner  told  a
small
<br>
Christchurch businessman that he owed a million dollars.  No explanation.

<p>
"But  I  have never earned a million dollars, this is a ghastly mistake  -<br>
how
<br>
do you reach this view?"

<p>
"We  are the IRD  -  we do not have to explain.  Pay half a million and you<br>
can
<br>
challenge."

<p>
"I don't have $500,000."<br>

<p>
We are the IRD   it's our job to be fair  -  we will bankrupt you!

<p>
The businessman, Dave Henderson, went to every MP in Christchurch  -
National,
<br>
Labour and the Alliance.

<p>
Not one would help.

<p>
Perhaps  I should  be more exact.  Gerry Brownlee wrote a letter that was of
no
<br>
help.    The  Labour  MPs  did  nothing  and  Jim  Anderton made it clear to
Mr
<br>
Henderson  that  he  thought  that  Mr Henderson was a tax avoider and he
had a
<br>
moral  duty  to  pay the IRD half a million, which left Mr Henderson
completely
<br>
depressed.

<p>
Then ACT got elected.

<p>
It  took  Rodney  Hide  a year of Parliamentary Questions, official
information
<br>
requests, bombarding the Ombudsman, the Commissioner and the Minister.

<p>
He eventually discovered that Dave Henderson did not owe a million dollars.

<p>
The IRD owed Dave Henderson $60,000.

<p>
The ACT Party has forced the first ever review of the IRD.

<p>
We  have  had  an Inland Revenue Department for over 150 years and yet MPs
have
<br>
never  had  a  Parliamentary  Inquiry  into its activities.  MPs have dozens
of
<br>
inquiries  into  liquor and what New Zealanders do with their leisure but
never
<br>
into a department responsible for collecting the money.

<p>
That  committee has found there are many Dave Henderson.  People who out of
the
<br>
blue    -    or rather out of the IRD  -  got a demand for an impossible sum
of
<br>
money.  When they could not pay, their companies were seized, their assets
were
<br>
confiscated  and  they  were  bankrupted.    As  bankrupts  they  became
social
<br>
outcasts.

<p>
National.  Labour and the Alliance not only did not lift a finger  -  they
have
<br>
passed  new police state powers for the Commissioner.  If you make a mistake
in
<br>
filling  out  your  tax  forms    -    the Commissioner levels penalty
compound
<br>
interest.  Interest a mafia loan shark would be embarrassed to charge.

<p>
I  have  had,  in  my constituency office, people with debts to the IRD of
over
<br>
$100,000.   The original debt   -  less than $20,000  -  which the IRD said
was
<br>
not taxable.

<p>
Four  years later the IRD changed its mind, which by law it can do, even
though
<br>
its  advice  was  in writing, and then the IRD can say  -  now we want
compound
<br>
interest.

<p>
There is no way that the state can take 40% of all we earn without these
police
<br>
powers.    You are not free to choose, if the state is going to take 40% of
all
<br>
you earn.

<p>
Of  course  -  in your case it won't  -  it will be over 50%.  40% of the
adult
<br>
population  gets more from the state than they ever pay in taxes.  One in
three
<br>
is  on  state  assistance.  Thousands more get more from programmes like
family
<br>
support than they pay in taxes.

<p>
A  third of the country  -  most of you in this room, for the rest of your
life
<br>
-    will  pay  over  50%  of all you earn for all your life to pay for it.
At
<br>
least 10% of you will refuse and become economic refugees.

<p>
Why  should any person vote for either the school teacher or the mother to
tell
<br>
us  what  to  do?  We all know that they waste much of the money they take
from
<br>
us.    Millions  of  dollars  of  our  money is now being wasted on
politically
<br>
correct  Waitangi claims.  New Zealand has become the only country in the
world
<br>
to  say  that  a  race  of  people  own  the  electromagnetic spectrum.  As
the
<br>
dissenting judge said  -  that's a claim to own sunlight.

<p>
Yes, the claimant said  -  sunlight has great spiritual significance to
Maori.

<p>
Of  course  ordinary  Maori  don't see any benefit  -  we are just financing
an
<br>
elite.  Maoris are yet to see a snapper.

<p>
Now  Transit  is paying Maori to bless new roads.  A constituent of mine in
the
<br>
in the suburb of Kelburn had to get an expert to write a report that there
were
<br>
no  Maori spiritual values involved in his application for a new driveway.
His
<br>
private  property.    No  evidence  that  Maori had ever lived anywhere near
it
<br>
ever.

<p>
No report, no driveway.  He does not own his own home.

<p>
Only  ACT  opposes  this  nonsense.    Only ACT says let's resolve all the
real
<br>
grievances,  then  close down the Tribunal.  All settlements must be fair,
full
<br>
and  final.    Let's  remove all racial discrimination from the statute book
-
<br>
let's have one law for all.

<p>
Yesterday  I  spoke  to  some  Wellington  Polytechnic  students    -  and
some
<br>
politically  correct  student   -  who looked as if she is planning a career
in
<br>
the Treaty industry  -  said what about new grievances?

<p>
If you don't know about it after 160 years  -  it's probably bogus.

<p>
Only  ACT  says  that people do not have the right to retire at 18 on to
social
<br>
welfare.    ACT  supports  a  social  security  safety net not a social
welfare
<br>
hammock    -  social security has become a way of life.  Adults do not have
the
<br>
right to bludge off you.

<p>
Nor  do  criminals  have the right to live off you.  Burglary is a crime in
New
<br>
Zealand  that  pays.   Just 200 professional burglars, the police estimate,
did
<br>
over  50,000  burglaries.  They stole goods worth over a billion dollars.
Very
<br>
few have even gone to jail and those who did rarely served more than a third
of
<br>
the sentence.

<p>
ACT says  -  if you do the crime you should do the time.

<p>
There is a freedom issue in involved in opposing red tape and bureaucracy.
Over  5200  new laws and regulations have been passed affecting business in
the
<br>
1990's.  Hong Kong has got just one thousand.

<p>
Why should a taxi driver pay $300 a year to renew his license?

<p>
We need these laws because no-one is responsible for their actions anymore.

<p>
We  need OSH Act inspections because you can no longer sue people or
businesses
<br>
who cause you harm.

<p>
Since no-one is at fault  -  even for criminal negligence  -  the accident
rate
<br>
has rocketed.

<p>
Freedom and choice are at the heart of every political decision.

<p>
You  must  decide  whether  you  support  freedom  or  whether  you support
the
<br>
collective making your life decisions for you.

<p>
ACC is a good example.

<p>
ACT  has  advocated  that  employers should at least be able to choose who
they
<br>
insure with.  The state-owned ACC monopoly was wasteful and inefficient.

<p>
This  year  95%  of  all  employers  chose  a  private  insurer for ACC.  In
my
<br>
electorate  ACC  premiums  have  halved.    Some companies have saved a
million
<br>
dollars.

<p>
Labour  has  announced  that the private ACC insurance will be  re
nationalised
<br>
without   compensation.    The  insurance  companies  will  lose  $100
million.
<br>
Companies will have to pay at least $500 million more.  Because Labour does
not
<br>
believe that you have the right to choose.

<p>
Labour's  industrial relations policy is also opposed to choice.  Today you
can
<br>
choose  whether  to  join  a  union,  or choose a bargaining agent or
represent
<br>
yourself.   Under Labour, by law only unions will be able to represent you
in a
<br>
collective  agreement.    By  law,  you  won't  be able to receive the wages
or
<br>
benefits without joining the union.  Compulsory unionism by the back door.

<p>
The  average  trade  union charges $500 a year in fees.  You will find that
you
<br>
have  to  pay  it.  ACT says it is wrong in a free society.  I would remind
you
<br>
that some 300,000 workers have left trade unions since they became
voluntary.

<p>
Forcing  300,000  to  re-join  trade  unions will give the unions an extra
$150
<br>
million a year.

<p>
Labour's  industrial policy has nothing to do with fairness, freedom or
choice.
<br>
It's  all  about  giving  trade  unions,  who in turn finance the labour
party,
<br>
another $150 million a year.

<p>
It's  the  equivalent,  for  a worker being forced to join a union, of a 1%
tax
<br>
increase.

<p>
ACT  does  not support the tyranny of the majority.  Others can't exercise
your
<br>
choice for you.  So we do not support compulsory unions - or compulsory
student
<br>
associations.    If  just one person does not want to join your association
- I
<br>
support their right.

<p>
ACT is the only party to make that stand.

<p>
I promised to cover today education, fees, loans and allowances.  It's an
issue
<br>
of freedom and choice.

<p>
ACT  supports  all tertiary institutions - whether state-owned or
independent -
<br>
being  treated  the  same.  We see no reason why we should not have
independent
<br>
universities  as  we  now  have  private  and  very  successful polytechs.
ACT
<br>
believes  students  should  pay  full  fees.   There is no such thing as a
free
<br>
education.    It's  just  a  question  of  how  we pay.  Some - such as
pilots,
<br>
hairdressers and truck drivers - already pay full fees.

<p>
Of course, university fees are not based on the cost of tuition.  Over 40%,
and
<br>
in  some  cases  50%,  of  the cost is research.  Research is a public good
and
<br>
should be met by public taxes.

<p>
Which  brings  me to loans.  ACT supports the student loan scheme - without
it,
<br>
many  students  would  not get access to tertiary education.  ACT is opposed
to
<br>
Labour's silly idea that student loans be interest free while you study.

<p>
About  50% of all students do not have any loan.  If it was interest free
every
<br>
student  would  borrow to the limit - if only to take to the ANZ to put into
an
<br>
interest earning account.  It's a silly idea.  You really have a choice.

<p>
On  the  one  hand, the Alliance says universities should be free - trouble
is,
<br>
you can never leave because there won't be an economy.

<p>
On  the  other hand you have ACT, who says government and students have a
moral
<br>
contract.    You  pay the costs of tertiary tuition and government ensures
that
<br>
you  have  a  job  and  a  tax  rate  low  enough  so you can easily repay
your
<br>
investment.

<p>
Labour and National are just pale imitations of the Alliance.

<p>
Now  we  have  National  Ministers  wanting to direct you as to what you
should
<br>
study.    Maurice Williamson does not know you.  He does not know what you
want
<br>
to  do  with your life.  He is talking tripe.  If investment in science was
the
<br>
guarantee of success then the Soviet Union would have won the Cold War.
Prosperity comes from hard work, thrift and enterprise.

<p>
Wealth  is  created  by  the private sector and never by government.
Countries
<br>
built  on  freedom  and  choice are the countries that are wealthy and the
only
<br>
ones  worth  living  in.  You can only have freedom if you choose it and
accept
<br>
the responsibility that comes with it.

Extract from speech to Canterbury University 12.00 noon 9th September 1999

Labour will give unions $150 million a year

<p>
Freedom  and  choice  are  at  the heart of every political decision.  You
