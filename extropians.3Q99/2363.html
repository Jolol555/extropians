I do notice, however, that your reply is basically of the form "if we had
good, general-purpose code-writing GAs, then we could easily do all these
things".  Well, yes, I agree with you there - my point is that you can't
pull off this kind of scheme until after you break the GA bottleneck, so it
doesn't work as a method for attacking the bottleneck itself.

<p>
IMO you actually have two major constraints to deal with before you can get
the GA systems you want.  The mutation problem is the easy part - systems
like the CAM-brain project seem to be well on the way to finding solutions
via old-fashioned human inventiveness.  The really intractible problem is
how to write all those fitness functions.  What you need is an automated
means of writing fitness functions for any possible programming problem,
whether it is a floating-point computation, a query optimizer or a network
protocol stack.  AFAIK no one has any idea how to even approach this
problem, much less a viable avenue towards a solution.
