<i>&gt; &gt; As Phil Osborn said in his reply to Michaels reply to me, "if [a child] </i><br>
<i>&gt;were</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to form a personal trust and sell shares in himself, then he would have </i><br>
<i>&gt;a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; vested interest in maintaining the value of the shares, as these would </i><br>
<i>&gt;be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; his ticket to acquire further investment for going to college, starting </i><br>
<i>&gt;a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; business, etc."  I take this further and call it "slavery" simply </i><br>
<i>&gt;because</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; when the child most needs investment it is not at an age to consent.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Now</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it's true that under such a scheme I could buy a child and have him work </i><br>
<i>&gt;my</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; sugar plantation for zero wage but it is also true that I could train </i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; child to be a lawyer and make huge profits with minimum investment.</i><br>

Why don't we just keep the kids utterly ignorant and subject them to viewing 
30 hours or so of violence every week.  Then we can teach them to be 
responsible by forcing them to go to a place where they have to raise their 
hands to go to the bathroom, and we can force them to absorb by tedious, 
endless, boring repetition for the next six years what they could have 
learned easilly and naturally three years before in a Montessori school in a 
couple of years.  We can do that until they lose all love of learning and 
become corrupted little monsters that will kill on orders - or without, if 
need be.  Then we loose them on the world.  But of course this is just a 
fantasy - right?
