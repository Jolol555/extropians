<p>
This isn't necessary.  I believe that a "near"-nanotech/AI capable civilization
based on a single "home-world" cannot be eliminated if it has a "minimal"
defense posture (requires a strong belief or actual knowledge that
non-friendly ETs may exist).  [We do not currently have such a
minimal defense posture.]

<i>&gt; &gt;  sentient AI don't exist.</i><br>

<p>
This makes no sense.  Nanotechnology has a high probability of development
for tech-civs (since it is useful).  Sentient-AI  should also develop unless
actively prevented due to the dangers it may pose.  In any case non-sentient
AI is better for "reconstruction"/"revenge" than sentient AI since sentient
AI can change its program.  If you want to impose these restrictions, you
probably need a fundamentally different universe with different physical
laws (to make nanotech or AI very difficult).

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
You can probably wipe out the "primary" target(s), but unless you want to
remain on the run for the next ump-teen billion years, you have to
do atomic disassembly, radiation inactivation or temporal-spatial
removal of *ALL* possible revenger-bots in the system.  Since a
revenger-bot can probably be on the order of a few microns cubed and
you easily have trillions of them in suspend mode.  Eliminating them is
very difficult.  Atomic disassembly/irradiation take lots of energy and
time.  Temporal-spatial removal (by importing black holes) probably
generates gravity waves that provide advance warning.

<p>
The challenge does lead to another interesting question:

<p>
  What is the most "defensible" architecture for an SI?

<p>
I would argue that it is the most "dispersed"/"stealthy"
configuration.  That would seem to imply that the most
"natural" (unengineered) systems are those that would
provide the greatest protection.   There would be nanotech
micro-SIs scattered all over the solar system being very
careful to make all energy absorption &amp; emissions look
natural (e.g. heat from the gravitational collapse
of Jupiter or a planet's molten core).  Communications
would have to be low-energy, directed and as white-noise-like
as possible.    It is clear that there is a trade-off between
maximal intelligence and minimal detectability.

<p>
There must be an interesting divergence point in the development
of SIs/ETCs where they decide to go the visible/stealth route.
If you are "visible", you want to have available huge energy
stores, massive seek-and-destroy capabilities, revenger-bots
for may parsecs around your stars/worlds, etc.  If you are
"stealthy", you want to develop slowly, leaving things just
as they would normally appear to an outside observer.
