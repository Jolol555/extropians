<a name="1949qlink1"><a name="1909qlink1">Forgive me, but that seems a bit silly. Why is it so important to you to
verify that he is 19 years old? I've sat back and read this list for some
time and it doesn't really seem to me that age should have any bearing on
</a>the discussions. The vast majority of what you discuss is not about life
<a name="1909qlink2">experience, but about hopeful visions of the future. Granted, some of the
issues involve a sort of enlightenment that may or may not only come with
age, but can you not simply read Eliezer's posts and decide for yourself
whether he has any wisdom?</a></a>

<a name="1919qlink1">After some discussion on this topic, I'm forced to confront the
fact that it doesn't seem we have any independent verification that
Eliezer is in fact 19.
</a>

<p>
He wasn't at the Extro 4 conference to my knowledge and I
haven't seen any letters from someone who hangs out with
him personally (though one would suppose these could be
forged by Eliezer himself posing as someone else).

<p>
I would argue that we need an independent verification, either
by multiple authenticated agents who know him or by a real
"netmeeting" with video (some kind of online Turing test
that would be difficult for him to fake using current
technology).

<p>
No offense intended towards anyone, just a case in point
about the degree to which we are going to have to question
our assumptions *and* beliefs.
