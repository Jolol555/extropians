<a href="http://www.infinitefaculty.org/sci/cr/le_expts.htm">http://www.infinitefaculty.org/sci/cr/le_expts.htm</a>.)

<p>
(I meant to get to this many months ago, but some personal
matters have occupied me for most of the last half-year. If
anyone can provide assistance here, it would be much
appreciated.)


<p>
<a name="3477qlink1">A recent comment by Natasha Vita-More, on the Transhuman list, reminded</a> me of
<a name="3477qlink2">the importance of stepping back from thoughts about what might</a> or might not be
<a name="3477qlink3">possible in four or five or six decades, and being certain</a> that we actually are
<a name="3477qlink4">still alive decades from now. Calorie restriction, I contend,</a> is currently the
<a name="3477qlink5">only appreciably effective life-extension regimen with good</a> evidence behind it
<a name="3477qlink6">(others might add cryonics here too, where "evidence" would mean more than
merely empirical evidence). Personally, I'm willing to put up</a> with the hassles
<a name="3477qlink7">of being on CR for now; but when a newer, equally effective means of
life-extension is available, I'll happily bag CR. Likewise, when</a> a _currently_
<a name="3477qlink8">available, non-CR, putatively effective life-extension regimen garners
sufficient scientific support to enable us to scratch the "putatively,"</a> I'll bag
<a name="3477qlink9">CR. One question, then, is what to make of the handful of existing</a> studies that
<a name="3477qlink10">purport to show a slowing of aging -- albeit a small slowing of aging</a> -- by
<a name="3477qlink11">means of something other than CR.</a>

<p>
After raising some of these points on Cryonet many months ago, I got an
interesting, challenging response from Thomas Donaldson. (A quasi-summary post
is here: <a href="http://www.cryonet.org/archive/10663">http://www.cryonet.org/archive/10663</a>. Follow-ups should be easy to
find.)

<p>
The main question that was under discussion is whether, in fact, there are any
well-conducted, repeatable (shown by having been repeated) studies demonstrating
an anti-aging effect of something other than Calorie restriction. Donaldson
suggested that there were. I disagreed. He encouraged me to take a closer look
at some of the studies I hadn't read in a long time (including some that
actually haven't been repeated, but were nonetheless intriguing), to verify,
among other things, that my claims that they weren't well-conducted were
justifiable. To give the "CR isn't currently the only way to go" thesis a run
for its money, I thought it would be worthwhile to get together a list of ALL
the non-CR studies claiming to have shown an increase in maximum life span, then
examine all of them (which is to say: I'm STILL not ready to respond to
Donaldson's request! -- sorry; can't be avoided). Such a list may already exist
somewhere on the Web; I looked but couldn't find it. Thus, I'm wondering if
people could help fill in the blanks in the list below, including those studies
referred to in parentheses, or point me to a list of such experiments, if it
exists. (Some of the blanks below I could fill in myself, especially the
melatonin studies; I just got burned out while trying to finish the list, and
decided that I should wait until I'm certain such a list doesn't already exist.)

<p>
The criteria for the studies are:
<br>
1) The authors claim to have produced an increase in maximum (not merely
average) life span.
<br>
2) The studies were published in peer-reviewed publications (non-published
conference talks don't count).


<p>
[The second question at issue in the Cryonet discussion -- whether Donaldson's
claim that CR studies themselves are not sufficiently oriented towards
discovering the mechanism behind its mode of action -- I will leave for later
(and will likely never get to, interesting though the question be). In brief: I
disagree. CR studies are mostly moving towards a basic science orientation,
which is the right way to discover CR's mechanism, however much any one study
will generally not have global implications.]


<p>
Below is what I have so far. Some of these may not meet the above criteria, but
it's been claimed by people who seem to know what they're talking about that
they do. In the case of studies of a substance/regimen that meets the above
criteria, I'd also like to get studies that are negative on the
substnace/regimen.

<p>
If anyone has additions, please add them. I'll post the whole list again after I
get some additions. (And then after my next trip to the medical library, I'll
post the list with commentary, will add any other experiments I find, and will
remove those that don't belong.)

<p>
I suggest that people who have additions post them to Sci.life-extension, so
that others will know that the effort of finding particular studies has been
done. It's not necessary to use the format I've used below, though it would be
helpful (the URLs are to the PubMed entries, citation format, with abstracts,
where available).

<p>
And if such a list already exists somewhere on the Web, please post the URL.

<p>
When the list is complete, and the studies are assessed, then examining these
questions will be possible:
<br>
1) Of those studies which look good but haven't been repeated, is it that
attempts to repeat the study have been tried, and weren't successful (and it
wasn't published, because negative findings often aren't published)? Or is it
simply that the funding or motivation hasn't been there (because of "orphan" or
similar status, for example)?
<br>
2) If it's reasonable to conclude that there are no drugs/regimens other than CR
that can slow aging appreciably (by as much as CR, or close), what's a
reasonable estimate of the date at which such regimens will be available? And
3) How does the assessed date of the beginning of the post-CR era affect one's
decision to go on CR now? (The big question, for me.)

<p>
Thanks much!
<br>
Brian.
