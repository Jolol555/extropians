Ron I may have misinterpreted Gina's original question.  Assuming
she did not restrict herself to a *building* as we know it, but meant
*any* structure, practical or otherwise, in a 1 G field, how high could
it go?  Lets ignore wind loads, since everyone would have different
assumptions on that, plus the aero drag on circular cross sections
are approximation-ey.  Also, lets forget fiber composites, since they
tend to be lousy in compression, and ignore soils restrictions (assume
an infinitely rigid infinitessimally flat base).

<p>
Surprise:  for this kind of application, good old common steel does
as well as titanium.  The ratio of the sheer moduli (Ti/steel) is almost
the same as their density ratio (in fact steel is *slightly* better than Ti.
</a>
<a name="0882qlink2">Steel beats aluminum and magnesium too).  So assume a steel tower
and a solid round cross section since making it hollow doesnt allow you to
go any higher.

<p>
Lets assume a steel tower, minimum diameter of one meter at the
top, maximum diameter of  200 m at the base, sheer modulus of
8.3E4 MPa and a density of 7.8 g/cm^3.  Come back tomorrow
with an answer, see if we get the same.  spike
