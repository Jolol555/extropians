<a name="1380qlink1">But even by your figures, a 100 kg mass would expect 2 x 10^7 hits from
a supernova 2 ly away.  In a body of many billions of cells, that's quite 
trivial.  Only about 1 cell in a 1000 will take a hit, and the vast majority
of hits don't do anything significant.</a>  A lethal dose of radiation needs 
enough
<br>
for most cells to take multiple hits to their DNA. This is still many orders
of magnitude short.  I'll bet an X-ray does far worse although I don't have 
figures in the house.  It takes a lot of photons, even X-ray, to make an 
image.
