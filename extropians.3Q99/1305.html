<a name="1321qlink1">We weren't talking about usefulness.  You said that since nobody had
designed an AI, nobody knows what it'll take to build one.  I designed
an AI.  I have some kind of vague idea of what it'll take to build it. 
That's all I'm trying to say.  My estimate may be wrong, but there's
nothing absurd "to the point of self-contradiction" about my making one.

<p>
Or are you seriously suggesting that I should try to write and run the
entire AI before even *trying* to estimate the hardware required?  The
<a name="1329qlink1">quantity and architecture of hardware *available* is a major factor in
software design.  Yes, we'll have a much better idea of what it takes to
run an AI after the first version fails - but I still have to guess,
now, with what I know now.

<a name="1321qlink2">BTW, my estimate is 1e17 ops/sec on CPU-like architectures.
