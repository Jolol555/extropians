Interestingly enough, there does appear to be an inversion occuring
in our society.  Closed circuit multiwavelength fiber does appear
to have the highest bandwidth and be the wave of the future for us.
I think the record is now up around 40 Gb/second on a single fiber
over many kilometers.

<p>
Both the military and the satellite manufacturers are looking seriously
at optical ground-to-satellite up/down links because the bandwidths
are higher.  Does anyone know if there are frequences where the clouds are
transparent that allow this?   The problem is that the multispectral
data volume gathered by the current generation of observing satellites is
so large that it is difficult to transmit via radio.

<p>
Radio on the other hand seems to be shifting from a broadcast medium
to a local communication medium.  You are going to get the greatest
carrying capacity out of radio if you use it in low-power cell-phone-type
or last-200-yards-to-home type applications while using the high bandwidth
fiber/cable carrying highly multiplexed signals over long distances.

<p>
This would seem to be due to simple physical efficiencies.  You want
to use the lowest power signal possible confined to the smallest possible
physical space (air or fiber) that provides an acceptable S/N
ratio at the receiver.

<p>
The SETI people have viewed with some dismay the rise of highly
directed point-to-point channels as that means to detect the
signals we are will have to be in the "line-of-sight".  That
means someone has to identify us and intend to communicate us
or we have to be in the path of a signal between two other
technological civilizations.  [The odds drop yet again....]
