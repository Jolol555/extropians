<a name="2814qlink1"><a href="2695.html#2699qlink1">&gt; Lets take a straw poll, how many people in the group</a><br>
<i>&gt; were "outsiders" as children, e.g. played mostly alone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; had only a few friends, or were generally rejected by</i><br>
<i>&gt; the social cliques that educational system produces?</i><br>

<p>
Count me in, or rather out, or ... oh, nevermind--I'm
going to go somewhere and read.</a>  

<p>
As far as the general debate about twin studies is
concerned, I note that although we get good numbers out
the twin studies and can draw useful conclusions and
rational actions from them, they still don't reflect
"genes" vs. "environment" much to the extent that the
conditions of the womb are environmental, and have been
shown to have significant effects of development (for
example the recent link found between maternal hypothyroidism
 and low IQ).  I am not aware of any studies
on identical twins /gestated/ as well as /raised/ apart.
(Yes, I am aware that many studies are controlled to
some extent for maternal nutrition and other factors
to make them better reflect genetic difference--but
these controls are still just guesses).

<p>
My personal experience is that I cannot attribute any
of what I call my "intelligence" to education; every
moment of the 14 years I spent in school was a waste of
time for me.  I cannot attribute all of it to genetics
though either: my parents are remarkable and I do credit
them for a great genetic heritage (except possibly for
my father's baldness), but I think the greatest influence
on my developing mind was my older sister, with whom I
I played and competed.
