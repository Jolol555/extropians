<p>
There are digital pulse radio-based handheld SAR prototypes being
evaluated for discovery of (breathing/moving) persons behind
walls/doors for police use (shoot here, x marks the spot). Should such
things come into widespread use I guess I wouldn't mind applying a
little tinfoil to my appartment (just as in "Conspiracy Theory"), just
in case.

A partially aluminized polymer film on windows is actually pretty
useful in heavily insolated areas of the world. Just don't sputter
chrome on it...

<p>
So you're telling me the cavity of a ~1 mm wall hollow sphere mounted
on an insulator will be seeing EM radiation softer than xRay? Don't
think so. (Unless you apply sufficient power to evaporate the
conductive layer, that is).

<p>
Besides, it is hard enough to tinfoil a room without grounding the
metal layer (unless you live in Teflonia).

<p>
There is currently some discussion on protecting a wearable computer
against an EMP attack on the wear-hard@haven.org list. Strange that
Dela Lu wasn't hardened against NEMP, but it certainly makes for more
suspense in the story.
