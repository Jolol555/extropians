From: "Robert J. Bradbury" &lt;bradbury@www.aeiveos.com&gt;

<a href="4696.html#4736qlink1">&gt;There is a city, I believe in Arizona, being constructed in an</a><br>
<i>&gt;architectural/ecological framework by an architect (whose name</i><br>
<i>&gt;I don't remember), who apparently came to America to study under</i><br>
<i>&gt;Frank Lloyd Wright.  The gentleman, I believe is now in his '80s</i><br>
<i>&gt;and his students/city citizens slowly build/add-on to the city</i><br>
<i>&gt;as funds from lectures, tours, etc. permit.</i><br>


<p>
Arcosanti, a prototype arcology designed by Paolo Soleri. As
someone pointed out it has numerous problems due to the "culture"
that is building it, but it is fascinating never the less.

<p>
It can be viewed online although I don't have the ref handy...

<p>
Soleri's book "Arcology: city in the image of man" was very
interesting, I made the mistake of loaning it out and have been
unable to find a second copy.  ;(

<p>
Like Biosphere 2, even though they make mistakes, I give them a
standing ovation for effort....
