<a href="5226.html#5233qlink1">&gt; This is kind of a derivative of a Restaurant/club that was (and perhaps</a><br>
<i>&gt; still is in Seattle) called Entros.  They had half a dozen or more</i><br>
<i>&gt; "stations" where you and your other dining guests could solve puzzles,</i><br>
<i>&gt; make dolls, experience wierd physical stuff (hmmm...), etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt; while you were waiting for your table to come up.</i><br>

<p>
Well, yes it's still there; at least as of three weeks ago.

IMO the uniqueness of Entros is not the challenge of the games, but the
"forced" collaboration of the group in order to win...and the realization
that different people bring different types of problem-solving skills to the
table. At Entros it seems necessary to utilize a diverse population to
maximize the outcome.

<p>
And it would be *interesting* to have Extropians adapt the games for a
gathering... each randomly grouped team responsible for contributing a game.

<p>
Of course, then, there was also the olde Rug Factory for the Halloween
extravaganza. Visual disorientation its forte in an Escherian room
exponentially enhanced with simple strobe lighting.
