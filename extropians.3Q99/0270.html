Thanks Robert, I agree with you.

<a name="0315qlink1">My initial comment was based on the fact that I grow not only tired, but
weary of historical accounts focusing on any one type of thinking and/or
contribution to cultural advances.  I think it is important to recognize
that ideas within the culture stem from many sources.  Some of these
sources are more subtle than others, yet just as poignant.  Ignoring this
is not a fair and complete account of our branching tree, nor its roots.  

<p>
I'm more interested in the quality and "rounded" (no pun intended)
influence of meme breeders.  By rounded I am referring to the scope of the
breeder and all the areas of thought and ideas that affect our lives.</a>  I do
not have a strong background in science fiction, yet I have been involved
in transhumanism, and speaking and writing on transhumanist ideas
publically, since the early 1980s.  How did I get the memes?  I got them
from individual works that gave me a broad reference point, rather than a
narrow one.  Works in the arts, astronomy, psychology, sociology, health,
athletics, the domain of mothering, nurturing, loving, sexuality, zoology,
journalism, etc.
