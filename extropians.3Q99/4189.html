Cute!

Thank you for bringing this up, because it ties in to activities in my
area.  Some of the DC group has also been discussing the promotion of
cryonics--several board members of the LES here are starting to arrange to
give presentations on the topic to increase awareness of it and other modes
of life extension.  (our first stop--the Skeptics Society!  Why not
practice with the hardest audience first.)

<p>
When Drexler gave his 'why I hate the east-coast' speech a few years ago at
Exto-3, I remember asking him to reconsider that.  I felt that he was
writing off potential resources, including the rapidly growing
transhumanist presence that is part of the high-tech corridor here.  Well,
guess where Mr. S. spends much of his time?  He works with the President's
Committee on Physical Fitness, he does political fundraising, he visits
Maria Shriver, his wife, in the studio. I've run into him twice walking the
street.  

<p>
<a name="4242qlink1">In the absence of someone having a friendship with Mr. S., I think that to
'get to' this particular actor, one would need to show the relationship of
cryonics to one of his interests:  politics, physical  fitness, or possibly
science fiction.</a>  Tangentially, one could try to interest Maria Shriver
into doing a story on cryonic suspension, which actually might interest her
producers.  I could help write a pitch proposal and do some of the legwork
if anyone is interested in pursuing that angle.
