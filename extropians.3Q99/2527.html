Well, generally speaking people don't build engines if there
is no fuel to put in them... :-)

<p>
A number of fairly serious scientists have done preliminary
designs for antimatter rockets/engines during the last 20+ years
and then do calculations on how this would impact the times for
interstellar travel [it still takes a long time!].

<p>
We can produce antiparticles (it is done every day at CERN, the
Fermi Laboratory and a few other places).  The problem
currently is to take the anti-particles (which are traveling
in particle accelerators near the speed of light), slow
them down, combine the anti-protons &amp; anti-electrons
into anti-matter and store them in a trap (e.g. a fuel
tank) for long periods without having it explode.
I believe we may be at the point where we can
store a few hundred anti-atoms currently.

<p>
We need a lot more anti-matter if we want to use it as
fuel and the problem is that the production of anti-matter
is very inefficient and therefore is very expensive.
It would probably take the entire power output of nations
for weeks to produce enough antimatter fuel for you to make a
short trip in your car.

<p>
<a name="2557qlink1">Then there is the problem that combining anti-matter and
matter produces a lot of radiation, so we would need to
redesign your car so that you have a big lead shield
between you and the antimatter engine.  At that point
the car weighs a lot more and you need even more
anti-matter fuel to make it go.

<p>
Hope that explains it.
