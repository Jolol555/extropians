Not quite.  We can breed any elements we want if you want
to devote enough energy to it.  However, the rate of production
is *very* slow.  You also have to sacrifice energy for current
thought to produce the elements for enhanced future thought.
I would not want to be the person responsible for the present-value
analysis of that equation!

<i>&gt; </i><br>
Yes, as soon as you max out your solar system in terms of
energy/materials, your growth rate declines sharply.
Though it remains interesting in terms of what *exactly*
you want to think about.  The sun produces enough energy
in ~50 years to break/recast all of the atomic bonds
in the non-stellar material.  So in that time frame
(or less if you are clever about chemical transformations)
you can "rearchitect" your computers to think optimally
about something completely different.

<p>
It is interesting if you consider the growth curve --
nonexistant, slow, somewhat faster, exponential, very slow.
(That is over a ~5-6 billion year period if we are typical.)
<a name="2154qlink1">However the "growth curve" may be disconnected from the
"thought/knowledge curve" in ways we cannot currently comprehend.
