The &gt;H list has occasional bouts of political fervour of various stripes,
but remains about as politically neutral as it is possible to be with
sentient entities present, IMO.

With regard to cross-posting: I think it's reasonable that closely related
but differing communities will spring up, and that cross-posting will
occur.  A significant advantage is that this may make people aware of
other mailing lists, perhaps better suited to their interests. It's also
a spur to programmers to create better mail filtering capabilities!

One.
