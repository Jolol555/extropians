Well, it appears I've stuck my foot in my mouth again.

That was in no way the intent.  I view them as somewhat orthogonal
to each other, so neither can be "better" than the other.  The only
thing there can perhaps be is greater emphasis on one area or another
by the different groups.

I'm learning.

<p>
I don't feel in any way that ExI or Extropian Principles are
better than the WTA or The Transhumanist Declaration.
Given that primarily the same people contribute have contributed
to the source documents of both organizations, I can't see how
they can be much different.  If the organizations are not
"virtually" the same, then one has to distinguish between
them in some way.  It is my *personal* feeling that the WTA
is trying to encompass "national" organziations under an
international umbrella.  It also seems to be true that
one is primarily located in the U.S. and it seems the
center of the WTA is in the U. K.  I'm primarily involved
in the one which is closest to me.  I naturally support the
WTA in its efforts as well.  I don't feel I have the time
to support/follow both organizations, both mailing lists,
etc. if I want to stay up-to-date with the other things I
bring to this forum (science, nanotech, aging, etc.).

<p>
If I may make a suggestion to people reading my posts --
I am not a wordsmith to the same degree as some of the
other people on this list.  When I write something, it
may make sense to me in my mind, but I may not be
communicating it fluently.  I'm probably much better
at selecting machine instructions than I am at English words.  
So, please try to read between the lines.  If I support
the "Extropian Principles" and "The Transhumanist Declaration"
and I say something which is logically inconsistant with
those, then you should feel free to apply the proper correction.

<p>
Robert
