In a message dated 99-07-21 20:06:58 EDT, you write:

<a href="0945.html#0971qlink1">&gt; Why am I the only person on this list who doesn't know if there are </a><br>
nonhuman 
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0971qlink2">&gt;  artifacts on Mars or not...?</a><br>

For what it's worth, I think it's probably more likely that I'll run into 
Elvis today at lunch than that there is a human face sculpted into a mountain 
on Mars.  But if you want to approach the subject with a fresh and open mind 
and a very healthy dose of skepticism, hey, it's your time and effort that's 
involved, so it really doesn't bother me.  I can understand why people will 
react negatively, because if a subject has attracted known kooks and been 
treated positively on the cover of the National Enquirer, smart and 
well-informed people will recoil from it -- it's just human nature to not 
want to be associated with something they find repulsive; namely, dangerous 
credulity.  That natural reaction MIGHT cut off valuable inquiry into 
worthwhile subjects from time to time, but probably more often saves one 
wasted time and effort and protects one's reputation for rationality.  If 
that devolves into true close-mindedness and bullying, it's a bad thing, I'll 
agree.  Whenever such value-based balancing acts are called for, you can't 
satisfy everybody.
