<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; Investment web page (so we can do one-stop shopping) and</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps this is already in place and I'm speaking in the</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

I've been involved somewhat recently with an angel group in
Atlanta (angelatlanta.com), so maybe I can comment a bit. I
<a name="2026qlink2">was not at Extro4, so perhaps you got some tips on companies
in need of funding.<a name="1970qlink1"> That is the big problem with forming an
</a>
angel group- finding the companies.<a name="2026qlink3"> By the time you see a
real press release from a company, they are probably past
the angel stage and into the big VC money (past where we
</a>
might want to invest). So either you have to get people into
the angel group who will be able to consistently find</a> these
startups at their early stage, or you will have to advertise
your group sufficiently well so that the startups know about
you.

<p>
The angel site I mention above does provide online biz plans
and info for the angels to read, but I think RL meetings
with potential investments are required. You have to be able
to meet the management team and really<a name="2026qlink4"> question them before
</a>
you will have enough confidence to invest. Video conferencing
_might_ be able to fill this gap.
