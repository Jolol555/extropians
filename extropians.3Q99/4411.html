<p>
Although she's originally from Oz, she's been living in the States for
years, in LA. She has written or hosted a variety of media programs on
science (she has degrees in mathematics and, IIRC, physics).

<p>
She's had two good-selling books out, PYTHAGORAS' TROUSERS (on gender and
science) and THE PEARLY GATES OF CYBERSPACE (about how awful the likes of
extropians are). 

<p>
The article in question appeared in an Oz newspaper, but looks like
something syndicated from the States.

<p>
Now that I've read the piece, I agree with the estimate of my pal who drew
it to my attention. One would be forgiven for thinking Ms Wertheim is a
nitwit; that's not just another way of saying that I disagree with her
expressed views and she with mine, she's good at making such amazing
blunders as stating (in PEARLY GATES) that the opening words of the Bible
were `In the beginning was the Word'..., which goes nicely with her recent
thumb-tongued announcement that we'll be condemned by our transhumanist
ancestors.

<p>
On the other hand, she is by no means a creation `scientist', and claims
not to be religious. True, her attempted arguments are steeped in a kind of
default religiosity. However, as the mutant supergenius has reminded us,
even some people on this list are prepared to embrace the `ineffable
something' that allegedly provides the spark to our otherwise dull and
materialistic information machines. 

<p>
Wertheim's rhetoric in the article uses the ever popular move in which one
sets out by describing various wonders of lab science - in this case, the
lovely Cynthia Kenyon's work in tripling *C. elegans* lifespans - then
adding, `Extending human lifespan is not just the preserve of loony
transhumanists' (I paraphrase, not having the rag before me). Argument by
pejorative adjective. Weird, man. Quant suff.*
