        I'm not sure how true the above is.  Anecdotally, we see Picasso 
screwing
<p>
    around -- yet I hardly think his wealth and success measured well against 
a
<p>
    lot of nonartists, especially those in business such as Bill Gates, Andrew
    Carnegie, or Leona Helmsley.

You missed the whole point, 'time being wealth' - viewing time as a resource. 
That is a key and vital piece of information. I know millionaires who work 
all the time and have no time for their families, friends or leaser. I know 
artists who have time to create, but little money... 
Money you can always make more of.

Time, once it's gone, baby it's gone...
