[Note from Matthew Gaylor:  My thanks to Ashley Clements
&lt;cheechwz@mindspring.com&gt; (MAP, FEAR &amp; November Coalition listmaster) for
alerting me that the US has already tested these fungi on an unwilling
population.  The US is getting way out of control in Latin America. Can
anyone see the US screwing up Peru's agriculture and "curing" it with
massive US aid.  It looks like the US is gearing up their propaganda
machine about Columbia.  US special forces are already there and I expect
to see massive US troop involvement in Columbia in the next year...Unless
you fight like hell by calling your congresscritter if and when this
happens.  And just where the hell is the environmental movement on this
one? ]

"In Peru, angry farmers have recently accused the United States of using a
soil fungus to destroy coca in the Upper Huallaga Valley, saying that the
fungus has spread to banana, yucca, tangerine and other food crops,
according to the Miami Herald. American officials, while acknowledging in
June that they had spent $14 million on research to develop such biological
agents against poppy, coca and marijuana, denied the charges."
