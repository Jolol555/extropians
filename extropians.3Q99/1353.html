True.

<p>
True.

<p>
True, but they and the high speed electrons and protons that also come from
the supernova would produce radioactive isotopes in the atmosphere that
would be no fun at all. The ozone layer would go to hell too.</a>

That is very far from obvious.

<p>
I have no idea what you're talking about. You seem to saying that a human
body would not absorb even one neutrino from a nearby supernova, but
you can't possibly mean</a> that.

<p>
To repeat myself, energy has little to do with danger, just one X ray
photon could kill you if it hits in the right place and in fact that very
thing  is a major, perhaps the major, cause of the most feared disease
of the 20'th century that kills millions of people every year.</a></a>

Yes, I rather think you do.</a>
