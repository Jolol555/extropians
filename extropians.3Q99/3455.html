True.  On the other hand, I think it deserves to be pointed out that
here, on Extropians, which is concentrated on one end of the bell curve,
the generalizations are less true, on the personality level, than in
other places.  I think that almost all of us try to be more self-aware
and transcend those parts of ourselves we don't like.  Just as (these
are guesses) rather more than 6% of Extropians have political
persuasions that differ from their parents, and just as we're less
likely agree with the conventional opinion in our native culture for
almost any given subject, I imagine that the effect of gender
differences is also diminished.  Because we're rational people, we
converge to rational personalities, regardless of our initial state.

<p>
Of course, somebody ought to verify all that and publish it in the
Journal of Transhumanism, but it seems like a good bet.  (If anyone
wants to dispute this, we can take it to the Foresight Exchange.)
