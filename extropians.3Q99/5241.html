There is such a neighborhood that is doing something a lot like
this already, in Palo Alto CA.  Interesting experiment, brings up
a lot of big brother kinds of comments, but of course the cameras
are being set up and run not by any government but by a large
number of little brothers hoping for nonlethal means of protecting
their property.

Heres one point that hasnt come up in this thread:  Eliezer (or someone)
once had a tagline that was about how societies change.  It is not
so much by individuals changing their minds, but by new generations
of people with different ideas coming along.

Our whole notion of privacy will soon be transformed by a generation
of young people who have *always* been under constant surveillance,
starting at their daycare.  There is a webcam there.  These will simply
fail to understand why anyone would be squicked by having a camera
broadcasting their every move.  spike
