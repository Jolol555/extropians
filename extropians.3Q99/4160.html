I'm not sure how construction such a list would be, other than maybe to
be looked at as a goals list.

<p>
My $0.02 worth:

<p>
Coercive government
<br>
Pain
<br>
Physical suffering
<br>
Death
<br>
Those damned mustard packets that you have to open with your teeth.
Traffic Jams
<br>
Malnutrition
<br>
Disease
<br>
Sexual frustration
<br>
Housecleaning
<br>
Diaper changing
<br>
War
<br>
Elusive Visual Basic bugs that take you 3 hours to track down
Barbie Dolls
<br>
Teenaged Boy "Singing" groups (Menudo, In Sync, Backstreet Boys, etc.)
White Folks who think they can dance
<br>
Politics
<br>
Representative Democracies
<br>
Trans Ams and Camaros

<p>
And the number one thing to say goodbye to:

<p>
Crummy Episodes of The X-Files

"If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from us in peace.  We ask not your counsel nor your arms.  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.  May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen."   --Samuel Adams
