I have to chime in here too.  Both Spike and Cynthia are correct.  If one is
truly an individualist, such percentages -- such as how many women voted for
Clinton, how many Blacks are in prison, how many White males are
Republicans, how many Asians are engineers -- should not matter.  All of
this would only be of interest to the specialists in sociology and related
fields.  However, since a lot of collectivism has seeped into our culture,
too many people -- sadly, even people on this list! how many polls have
there been done here!?! -- tend to look at themselves and others as members
of groups first, as individuals second or not at all.

<p>
And since a lot of people in power want to divide and conquer so they can
unite and rule (to borrow a phrase from Ellsworth M. Toohey:), this plays
right into the hands of any powermonger who comes along.

<p>
Cheers!
