That must be what I heard of.

That's only if you're going to use them as solar panels.  I assume if you
were only going to use such panels for corrections, then you wouldn't need
to do as much.

<p>
<a href="1075.html#1078qlink3">&gt; It's difficult to do this for the control electronics, though they</a><br>

<p>
Well, I would suspect, any space vehicle of platform that would be built to
last decades or longer would have to take into account periodic maintenance
and replacement of parts.  Or such redudancies would have to be built into
to so as to account for this.

<p>
I bet with nanotechnology or some form of biotechnology, some of these
problems can be "solved."  (In quotes because we don't need a total
solution, just one that works until something better comes along.  I.e., I
can live without a teleporter as long as my car is safe enough and gets me
there in one piece in a reasonable amount of time, etc.:)

<p>
There are other problems with interstellar travel -- how this thread first
started??? -- that need to be solved too, such as traveling at high speeds
through the interstellar medium.  It may even be that for the most part,
nothing will happen, but what of nearing planetary systems, where there's
bound to be more matter.  Now, these are not insoluable and plenty of
interesting solutions have been proposed, e.g., steering around detectable
concentrations of matter.

<p>
BTW, I'm a genxer who is into both mind and space exploration.  I think by
exploring the latter, we kind of get a good idea of the former.  Pushing to
the limits in any area helps us to understand what we are.  (This comment is
not aimed at Doug.:)
