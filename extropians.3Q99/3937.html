It's true that many of the basic building blocks of life, like amino acids,
form pretty easily.<a name="3944qlink1">  But actually assembling some kind of self-replicating
system or cycle is still not well understood.</a>  In particular, it is very
hard to find non-biological pathways to synthesize RNA or DNA.  At this
point it looks unlikely that the first self-replicating systems used these
chemicals, but there aren't any well accepted alternatives.
