<i>&gt;  </i><br>

<i>&gt;  The EU governments see the U.S. going to GM crops so they know in order</i><br>

<i>&gt;  The farmers see that GM crops will be more productive so fewer</i><br>
<i>&gt;  fields will be required to grow them.  They see a reduction</i><br>
<i>&gt;  in subsidies and price supports and so they try to put pressure</i><br>
<i>&gt;  on the government to stop GM crops.  When that doesn't work they</i><br>
<i>&gt;  respond by resorting to spreading FUD (fear, uncertainty &amp; doubt).</i><br>
<i>&gt;  If they happen to get the ear of a sympathetic legislator (who</i><br>

<i>&gt;  you then get labeling legislation that then feeds back to the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  public.  Since the public knows nothing about science, if "labeling"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  is required, then there must really be something to fear about GM crops.</i><br>

<p>
This is a great analysis of how the "codependency" relationship of subsidized 
EU farmers can lead them to support the spread of "FUD".  I agree with the 
point you made later in the same post that societies like China and India and 
ones in Africa won't be as responsive to the argument that GM food crops are 
"sacrilegious", but the fact is that the two leading industrial powers (EU &amp; 
US) are headed for a showdown in the middle of Main Street at high noon over 
this issue.  I don't know the legal details, but I can easily envision the EU 
citing "health and safety" exceptions to GATT to support draconian 
prohibitions on the import of US GM foodstuffs.  Perhaps we DO want this, as 
we'd basically then be dealing with a "junk science" trial . . . "Inherit the 
Genes"?

I'd kind of like to have a medium-sized velociraptor, with some dog-loyalty 
genes thrown in, as a hiking companion . . .
