<a name="0863qlink1">&gt; Which category is that, Spike?  Mr. Celibate?<br>

<p>
Oops I realized after the fact that I could have accidentally
caused a misunderstanding.  Natasha did not write the above
line, I did.  I was attempting a little self-deprecating humor. {8^D
Had she wrote it, I would have laughed, but she is more serious
minded than that I fear.

<p>
Thats my problem:  I dont care if people are laughing with me
or laughing at me, so long as they laugh.

Well, actually it was an academic interest.  I would like to see
Mr. Brains produce far more offspring, however, for the sake
of the human and transhuman kind.

<p>
Uh oh.  {8-[  Im on caloric restriction and consequently Im cold
all the time, even in a 74F room.  So, I wear wool business suits.
Always.  Its not a pretty sight... {8-[

<p>
I put Caring&amp;Generous in the brains category.  {8-]  spike
