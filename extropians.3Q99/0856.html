Michael,

<p>
This kind of positive statement requires a citation to the U.S. Code or the
decision of an authoritative court.

<p>
I would bet that most U.S. citizens would love it if it were true that only
those four classes of citizens were required to file income tax returns
and/or pay income tax, but, as a skeptic, I would also bet that if you
tried to use this defense in a tax evasion case, you would get your butt
thrown in jail (or at the very least, lose on the tax issues).

<p>
<a name="0859qlink1">Absent a citation to support the assertion that this is actually the law</a> of
the land, it seems like all you are doing is in fact, as the subject line
suggests, "Encouraging (Illegal) Tax Evasion."  The police power of the
United States is very real if they can get their hands on you.  People may
want to take the risk of reaping the benefits of successful tax evasion,
but the risks of criminal and civil punishment do exist.  And as both a
skeptic and a pessimist on the government's use of its coercive power, I
doubt that the U.S. Government exempts everyone not in one of those four
classes from the federal income tax.</a>

<p>
But I'd be very happy to be proven wrong....
