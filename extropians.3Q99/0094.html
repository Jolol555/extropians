<i>&gt;  CONCLUSIONS: These</i><br>
<a href="0046.html#0094qlink1">&gt;  results ... demonstrate that the paradigm, which</a><br>
<i>&gt;  states that low-dose effects can be predicted high-dose</i><br>
<i>&gt;  effects, cannot be systematically applied in radiation</i><br>
<i>&gt;  biology in general and gerontology in particular.</i><br>
This is supported by studies of natural background radiation -vs- cancer rates in humans.  If one lives with a higher natural background radiation level you tend to lower cancer rates.

<p>
It's especially destructive that the EPA/government "paradigm", as you say, is a linear model.  Almost anything is poison at a high enough dose, including food, air, and water.  Even reading the entire transhuman news feed could be fatal (no time to eat!) :-}

<p>
And like oxygen, many things pass from poison to nutrient as the dose is lowered.
I guess many billions of dollars are blown on the wrong environmental problems due to this linear bone-headedness on the part of the "scientific" community.  Worse yet is the public mental "model" of the effect of radiation - "Any 'radiation' is dangerous.".
