I am currently enrolled at DeVry institute of Tech,
undergoing rigorous (heh) training in order to
eventually become an electronics engineer.  I have a
project coming up that has to be related to
technology, be marketable, and be some sort of
breakthrough.  Seeing as how I'm speaking to some of
the most advanced technologists in the field, just
wondering if anyone would like to volunteer their own
pet ideas.  It has to be done with current technology,
but other than that, it's fair game.
