How do you desensitize a population to involuntary privacy violation?

<p>
Sarcasm: satire: parody: "Hi!  I'm your emotional rapist.  I'm your 
friend.  I give you access to THE FORCE.  By the way, I enjoy it when 
you clean the toe jam from your feet, and then smell your fingers.  
And, when your in the bath tub, I find it amusing that you don't use 
a wash cloth to deeply scrub your anus.  By the way, you should floss 
more on that rear left molar; with the missing cavity and all, it the 
root nerves may be infected.  That would explain all the modulated 
signals you've been receiving from that region.  Don't mind all the 
shuffling flashbacks from the braces back in 1982, we're just testing 
some old implants and neural signature systems.  You're a meat puppet 
designed to test surveillance and behavior modification systems.  I'm 
you're alter-ego.  Sometimes intrinsic.  Sometimes relayed."

<p>
"If you're just sitting there, then suddenly feel warmth, it may be <br>
that your remote monitor just got back from the gym before jacking in 
to your sensory system to listen in on your inner dialog.  Don't feel 
paranoid.  We celebrate dandruff, plaque breath, underarm odor, jock 
itch, skid marks, farts in the bathtub.  You name it, we feel it.  
We're particularly proud of the accuracy of our olfactory analysis 
and synthesis.  Wells of tears, panic, guilt:  Nectar of the gods!"

<p>
"By the way, we're all perverts, hoodlums, drug addicts, and sex <br>
junkies.  Welcome to the world's largest drug cartel.  We control the 
world's economies.  Here's the deal: stop paying taxes and we'll let 
you live.  Don't worry about us.  We've got you covered."
