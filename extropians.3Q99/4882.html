This explains something that puzzled me greatly.  I wanted to see a
real Inuit reservation.  One was shown on a map, but it wasnt clear
where it was exactly, as the scale on the Alaska map is... big.
I asked a merchant where this was, and he answered:  youuuu
would be better off staying out of there.
I answered all I wanted was to buy some native souveniers, he
insisted it would be poor judgement.  Volunteered that should anything
happennnnn to me on that reservation, there was not much the local
authorities could do about it.  spike
