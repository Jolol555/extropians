<a name="2812qlink1"><a name="2651qlink1">Since school started I've been forced to put responses further and further 
back on my priority list and it probably won't get any better since I also 
need to do some extra reading on subjects brought up in this list,</a> and also 
there's my own research.<a name="2646qlink1">  However, I would still like the groups opinion on 
<a name="2651qlink2">ideal government.

<a name="2703qlink1"><a name="2687qlink1"><a name="2680qlink1"><a name="2648qlink1">Most people would call me socialist for bringing this up but I think it is 
both socialist and capitalist.
<br>
The idea is:
</a><br>
Free Medical &amp; Dental
<br>
Free Education
<br>
Free Housing
<br>
Anything else you want you can buy.

<p>
The idea is by helping your neighbor you increase your own chance for 
survival.  Anyone for this? Against It? Any ideas on how it would work?</a></a></a></a></a>
