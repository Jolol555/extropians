<i>&gt; &gt; No he isn't = he is defending the noble present</i><br>

<i>&gt; Unfortunately, this document is meaningless, being nothing but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; assembled culture of a small segment of society with little direct</i><br>
<i>&gt; influence on the culture as a whole (but of course great indirect</i><br>
<i>&gt; influence by what they produce).</i><br>

<p>
Times change.  From cracker to hacker, and then, we hope, back to
cracker again.  Eric S. Raymond is a minor celebrity, now.  Perhaps the
media will repent of their linguistic folly.

<p>
<a href="0017.html#0024qlink2">&gt; Language, unlike reality, is a matter of consensus.  There are</a><br>
<i>&gt; no central authorities and no testable theories.  No matter how</i><br>
<i>&gt; many times you may protest that "gay" means "joyful", the fact is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that when the word is encountered by a typical English-speaking</i><br>
<i>&gt; reader, the first meaning that jumps to mind is "homosexual".  As</i><br>
<i>&gt; much as we want "hacker" to keep its original meaning as someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; who pushes limits and explores possibilities, the simple fact is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that 99% of English-speaking readers who encounter the word think</i><br>
<i>&gt; about teenagers breaking into computers illegally.  Merriam-Webster</i><br>
<i>&gt; includes both senses of the word, no doubt because computer geeks</i><br>
<i>&gt; pestered them into including the original usage, but there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt that writers and editors in the real world use only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; commonly understood meaning--what we would call a "cracker" (a</i><br>
<i>&gt; term used by absolutely no one but those still clinging to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; past glory of the word "hacker").</i><br>

<p>
Right, but using the term marks us as being part of said subculture and
therefore worth a much higher salary.

<p>
<a href="0017.html#0024qlink3">&gt; I too lament the loss of a good word.  But it /is/ lost, and it's</a><br>
<i>&gt; time to just get over it.</i><br>

<p>
The problem is that nobody has proposed an adequate replacement which
could be adopted in a synchronized way.  The best suggestion I've heard
is "wizard", and that doesn't have the same connotations yet.  Until then:
