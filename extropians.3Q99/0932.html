<a href="0895.html#0932qlink1">&gt;Express elevators could be set up like a conveyor belt, with an</a><br>
<i>&gt;'up' shaft next to a 'down' shaft.  That would require sideways</i><br>
<i>&gt;car transfer from shaft to shaft at the top and bottom.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;shafts would be filled with as many cars as there are express</i><br>
<i>&gt;stops.  </i><br>

<p>
There was a Scientific American article awhile back on "Future
Elevators" or somesuch that featured a system with multiple cars
per shaft,they also showed work in progress by Otis on a system
that could travel both vertically and horizontally ala a startrek
turboshaft.

<p>
Here in Chicago there is a building that has stacked elevator cars
(one above the other) that serve even/odd floors simultaneously,
the main floor is actually two levels......pretty neat solution.
