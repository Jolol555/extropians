<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Yes, I'm seriously advocating slavery.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;As Phil Osborn said in his reply to Michaels reply to me, "if [a child] </i><br>
<i>&gt;were</i><br>
<i>&gt;to form a personal trust and sell shares in himself, then he would have a</i><br>
<i>&gt;vested interest in maintaining the value of the shares, as these would be</i><br>
<i>&gt;his ticket to acquire further investment for going to college, starting a</i><br>
<i>&gt;business, etc."  I take this further and call it "slavery" simply because</i><br>
<i>&gt;when the child most needs investment it is not at an age to consent.  Now</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's true that under such a scheme I could buy a child and have him work my</i><br>
<i>&gt;sugar plantation for zero wage but it is also true that I could train the</i><br>
<i>&gt;child to be a lawyer and make huge profits with minimum investment.</i><br>

Not quite what I had in mind.  What reasonable court would recognize a 
contract signed by a six-year-old?  Obviously, for a contract to be valid, 
the signatories have to be capable of understanding the terms.

<p>
On the other hand, our hypothetical mutual fund local agent would tend to 
know who the responsible families were in the area, and the family would be 
drawn into the contract, I'm sure, in most cases.  This might involve some 
kind of backing or commitment from the family in the early stage, when there 
would be a lot more kids than money or investors, but as competition for the 
kids increased, the deals would get better, until the family might itself be 
offered a signup bonus, and the parents, extended family, etc., made general 
fund members, paid in shares.  Many incentives that would bring the maximum 
incentive to bear on the family come to mind.

<p>
The local data and expertise is fairly crucial, as the micro-loans program 
suggests, as is collective responsibility.  The kid could not be forced to 
honor the contract later on, but it would probably be very much in his 
interest to do so, as his share value would be a bankable asset in getting 
loans or future investments.  He would no more be likely in most cases to 
disallow the original contract than any corporation would be to basically 
commit suicide and let the share prices go to zero.

<p>
Those share values, representing his future earnings capability, are that 
kid's ticket to getting there.  This is just simple market economics.  
Investment for the future based on expected return.  We do it all the time.  
States do it when they build public schools, but they are extremely 
inefficient as the incentive structure is all wrong.  Now we have the 
technology to shred it down to the individual level, for everybody.

<p>
To extend the range of discussion just a bit, one of the major problems with 
our society and most world societies is the utter failure to bring the 
family into the 20th Century, or even the 19th Century, much less the 21st.  
Families used to be economic units.  Parents invested in children and 
expected a return - i.e., care in old age.  That gave them a major incentive 
to have healthy, smart, productive, responsible kids.  When the industrial 
revolution caused the breakdown of that economic unit, the incentives were 
also largely lost.

<p>
Why have a child now?  So that you can become an emotional parasite on the 
child?  Find meaning for your life - i.e., become an emotional parasite on 
the child?  Fit in and be a real person?  The child of today gets what he or 
she wants by pleasing the parents, as always, but the parents are no longer 
looking for physical rewards.  So what are they looking for?  When a woman 
provides this in return for the wherewithal to live, it's called 
prostitution.  So we force our kids into prostitution rather than have them 
take economic responsibility.

<p>
I understand that the Samoans, on the other hand, expect the child to pay a 
fixed percentage of their income - for life - back to the family.  This 
might seem like slavery, but not unless the child is forced to go along.  In 
a society structured to respect and reward personal responsibility, no force 
would be necessary.  A respectable person would pay his share.  A bad person 
could opt out, but at the risk of being shunned by good society and missing 
out on a lot of benefits.

<p>
A general social contract sponsored by the net might be a route to getting 
to the kind of society in which that kind of responsibility would be 
encouraged.  I would like to see parents start taking a real interest in 
optimizing their kid's abilities - for a change.

<p>
BTW, our family structure and psychology is based on a bastardized, 
corrupted vision of how the Europpean aristocracy raised their kids.  Recall 
Mark Twain's description of the "Little Lord Fauntleroy" syndrome?  This was 
part of the same Victorianization of America that screwed up the 
relationships between men and women.  We didn't have a model for how to be 
prosperous.  Common people had never been prosperous before 19th Century 
America.  So we were connned into this stupid vision of the aristocratic 
model, and we have been paying the price ever since.
