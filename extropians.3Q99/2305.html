Why going at such great lengths? There are enough holes in network
protocol stacks and applications to make possible its propagation to
be purely automatic. Since constituting the bulk of all installations,
one can essentially concentrate on x86/Win95/98/2000/NT ("Wintel")
machines, which makes the task of finding buffer overruns quite easy
(a small exploit library will suffice for starters). Each infected
machine would occasionally ping a random IP address, trying to infect
another target.</a>

<p>
<a name="2319qlink2">If we would have found an x86 machine code mutator function before
(Koza's 1000 node Beowulf would be the ideal substrate for this) and
add a GA buffer overrun seeker module such a software would be very
hard to kill indeed, because it would mutate faster than patch
distribution. Trying to infect routers and switches is another good
idea.</a>

<p>
Once good JIT Java is good enough we can consider mutating Java VM
instructions.

<p>
The earlier such worm software gets developed (its advent is
essentially inevitable) the less disruptive the effects will
be. Better tomorrow than a decade downstream, definitely. The IT
landscape could use a great deal more resilience and diversity, the
current Wintel monoculture is definitely asking for trouble.

<p>
It would be interesting to speculate if such software ecology
subjected to selection pressures (people and software search&amp;destroy)
could even become sentient/transcend. There is certainly enough code
and knowledge out there on the Net. Two decades from now both the
networking and crunch could be adequate.
