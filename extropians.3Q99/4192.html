There was a string of programs on TV a while back commemorating the
<a name="4241qlink1">thirtieth anniversary of the moon landings, culminating in a rather odd
discussion panel in the early hours. The panel consisted of people
convinced, to various degrees, that the moon landings were faked.</a> Many of
them seemed aware of the protective benefits granted by aluminium foil, as
it would block the mind-controlling death rays of the secret government/the
aliens/the pixies from Mars/whatever. One of them even had a little box that
would beep when he was targetted.

<p>
They were rather into crop circles, too.

Chris.

<i>&gt; Yup.  The landlord said the guy lived there several years, alone, with</i><br>
<i>&gt; almost no furniture.  All the foil was hung shiny side out (?).  Software</i><br>
<i>&gt; guy for Taligent.  He paid the rent on time and wasnt actually damaging</i><br>
<i>&gt; the apartment, soooo, OK.  Indeed, there were not even</i><br>
<i>&gt; any nail holes in the walls for pictures.  The landlord didnt ask for any</i><br>
<i>&gt; explanations, and the guy didnt offer any.  I dont know if he was</i><br>
<i>&gt; seeing a shrink.  He had done all the windows too, and even the</i><br>
<i>&gt; glass sliding door, which made it so it couldnt even be used as an</i><br>
<i>&gt; exit, without wrecking the, uh... decor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Landlord said the guy called one day and said he had moved out</i><br>
<i>&gt; and the key was under the mat.  Never heard from him again, left</i><br>
<i>&gt; the aluminum foil behind and never even asked for his cleaning deposit</i><br>
<i>&gt; back.  The worst part of it was removing all the tabs of double sided</i><br>
<i>&gt; tape.  Fortunately, the landlord knew that trichloroethylene kills the</i><br>
<i>&gt; sticky on most kinds of tape, so it comes away cleanly (free household</i><br>
<i>&gt; cleaning tip).</i><br>

smell

<a href="4168.html#4192qlink3">&gt; &gt;  and molt. I wasn't finally cured until I read Oliver Ducks' wonderful</a><br>
book

<i>&gt; Dontcha just hate it when ya make a typo on this list?  Several hundred</i><br>
<i>&gt; amateur commedians with nothing better to do than make wise cracks.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Actually this one *is* pretty funny...</i><br>
