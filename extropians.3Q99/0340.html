<a name="0342qlink3">        It is interesting.  I, too, am not primarily influenced by science
fiction.  That is not to say that I haven't read quite a few sf novels, but
their overall effect on how I live my life is quite minimal.  The two
exceptions are David Zindell's quartet, and Neal Stephenson's _The Diamond
Age_.  My influences come from reading about new breakthroughs and studies
which are actually being done.  Conceptual progress is a fabulous thing...
particularly for those new to transhumanism, but actualized progress is far
more preferable in my mind.  It is an exciting time to be alive.</a>
