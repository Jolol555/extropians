Right.  Its mass is not _rest_ mass.  It is all kinetic.  Photons, of
course, are never at rest.

<p>
It is not necessary, however, to have zero rest mass in order to be
one's own antiparticle.  The neutral pion has positive rest mass, but
is its own antiparticle.

There are even (in theory) static objects called geons in which
electromagnetic fields are stabilized under their own selfgravitation.
  I forget the details.

<p>
Right.  In particular, antineutrons ought to be attracted to the
earth, i.e., fall when unsupported.  I'm not sure if anyone has ever
kept any around long enough to check, but the corresponding experiment
has been done for positrons.

<a name="2259qlink2"><a name="2259qlink1">Antineutrinos exist in any case.  They are distinguished from

neutrinos by their helicity (direction of spin relative to their
direction of motion).  When a neutron decays, for example, it yields a
proton, an electron, and an antineutrino.  However, it seems to me
that if neutrinos have rest mass, this distinction must in principle
lapse, since you can then choose a frame of reference in which the
</a>
helicity is reversed.  I have never gotten an explanation of this
question from a real physicist.
