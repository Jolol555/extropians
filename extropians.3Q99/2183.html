<a href="2157.html#2183qlink1">&gt;Actually, it doesn't surprise me.  Remember, this is the guy who ended his</a><br>
<i>&gt;presidency with a chilling speech in which he warned the American people</i><br>
<i>&gt;about the extent to which "the military-industrial complex" (a term he used</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the speech) was preempting the formation of public policy by democratic</i><br>
<i>&gt;institutions.  He also oversaw the largest reductions in military force in</i><br>
US
<br>
<a href="2157.html#2183qlink2">&gt;history, even though ten years before he had organized and led the largest</a><br>
<i>&gt;high-tech (for its day) military operation in history (with what was, under</i><br>
<i>&gt;the circumstances, an amazingly small number of casualties).  Along the</i><br>
way,
<br>
<a href="2157.html#2183qlink3">&gt;by his candidacy, he blocked Douglas MacArthur's bid for the presidency, a</a><br>
<i>&gt;turn of good fortune the value of which it is hard to calculate, but is</i><br>
<i>&gt;almost surely a very, very good thing.  He was by no means perfect, but in</i><br>
<i>&gt;many ways, Eisenhower lived up to the ideal of Cincinnatus we were talking</i><br>
<i>&gt;about a while ago.</i><br>

I'd vote for him. I mean, if I voted for anyone.
