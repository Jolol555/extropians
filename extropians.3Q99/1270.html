    &gt;For the record, Sullivan et al (Science 199:</a>377-388 (1978)) showed that:
    &gt; An Arecibo-size antenna could detect UFH TV out to 2 light-years

<p>
<a href="0747.html#1270qlink2">&gt; And the Arecibo antenna could detect transmissions from another Arecibo size</a><br>
<i>&gt; antenna anywhere in the galaxy if it were aimed at the Earth yet we find no</i><br>
<i>&gt; such message.</i><br>

<p>
Do you have a source for this?  [I'm not doubting this, I just want the
hard data.]

<p>
There are enough "unexplained phenomena" (i.e. missing mass, gravitational
microlensing observations, excess infrared radiation in nearby galaxies,
missing "stars" according to standard stellar evolution theories, gamma
ray "glows", etc.) that one can reasonably postulate that *they do exist*
if one reconciles existing observations with evolution to the limits of
known physics.  The hiding vs. observable discussion revolves around
the fundamental question of whether you are willing to risk "detection"
(and therefore attack) tradeoff with intelligence (and defense capabilities).

<p>
If intelligence/local defense wins over remote attack capabilities
then all SIs should be "observable".  If there is a tradeoff between
defense &amp; intelligence/observability then there may be "stealth" SIs.

<p>
The fact that "they aren't here" or "they aren't easily observable"
are easily explained by the advantage of "local optimization of
capacities".   Remote activities don't gain you very much once
you are at the SI level.
