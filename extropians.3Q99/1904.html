that they cannot consent to the procedure?

<p>
This is an interesting and valid question to discuss without bringing
in the issue of government enforcement.</a>  Even in a fully libertarian
society, even in a world where I am the only person who exists, I must
face and answer this question for myself.  If we cannot debate the issue
without getting sucked into the libertarian quagmire, then we cannot
reach the most informed conclusions about what our decisions should be
in this regard.

<p>
Only those of us who come to the belief that such alterations are wrong
must then face the question of how to balance this wrongness against the
wrongness of intervening to prevent others from altering their unborn
children in this way.  But that question does not arise until we first
satisfy ourselves that we have a good answer to the first question of
whether the practice is good or bad.

<p>
And even when we face that question, it is not one which can be answered
by libertarian dogma.  Libertarians agree that coercion is wrong.
Most would attempt to stop a parent from harming his children, under at
least some circumstances.  The question is whether a potentially harmful
alteration which happens before conception also constitutes a form of
coercion and is therefore justifiably prevented in a libertarian society.
It is a question on which libertarians may differ, just as they currently
disagree about the abortion issue.

<p>
Raising the bugbear of government regulation is both premature and
unhelpful to the discussion of this issue.
