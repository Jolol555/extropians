    a few months back (sorry for the shitty ref) i saw, in _avation week and 
space technology_, a fairly large writeup about how work on noise 
cancellation systems was coming along. i remember in particular discussion of 
how experments with a two-big-bladed (there is probably a technical term for 
it, but i dont know it) helicopter (smaller then a chinook; sea knight 
maybe?) had achieved new levels of silence by carefully timing rotor speeds. 
also discussed in the article were methods of sliencing jet engines (in 
multiengine craft) by carefully timing the turbines... the researchers had 
high hopes for their work, and said it promised all kinds of good stuff, as 
is standard operating procedure.
<p>
    anyway, this is just a bunch of vague and fuzzily greenish thoughts in 
the back of my head. if anybody has anything further on this, id dig knowin 
about it.
