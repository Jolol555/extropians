Yep, that and "The Molecular Biology of the Gene" and a biochemistry book
(Voet/Stryer/Devlin) are pretty much standard library requiremetns
in our era.

"Salmonella strikes a balance", Nature, 16 Sep 1999, pg 218 --

<p>
"Entry of Salmonella *into* the epithelial cells that line
the gastrointestinal tract ... To force cells that do not
normally take up bacteria to engulf them, Salmonella *injects* a
protein into the host cell that *switches on* critical regulators
of host cell shape.  The bacteria are taken up during the ensuing
convulsions of the cell membrane.  Fu and Galan have now found
that Salmonella also injects a second protein into host cells that
increases the rate at which these same regulatory proteins switch off."

<p>
I had thought that Salmonella was too big to be an intracellular
bacteria, but apparently that isn't the case.  And much of my
not so recent education was in microbiology.  There is just
so much to learn.
