<a name="3277qlink1">I just joined this list recently, but I do not see a lot of what I would
I call "naive technophiles". I do see a lot of technophiles, and a lot
of naivete, but the naivete seems to be about the philosophical
undergirding of transhumanism, not about the technology. Taking
"controlled sips from a tidal wave" seems easy enough.</a> Technology can do
anything.<a name="3277qlink2"> But thought about * why*  taking a controlled sip from a tidal
