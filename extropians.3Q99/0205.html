ROTFL, this made my day. Thank you!!!!

<p>
It reminds me of a gentlemen's bar in Los Angeles which had a shower on
stage. The bar was shut down because the shower was not wheelchair accessible. 
The owner commented that they had never had an exotic dancer in a
wheelchair, but if they found one they would be sure to hire them and make
the shower accessible.

Best Ralph
