Maybe this "somewhere (over the rainbow)" is some kind of "interpretation
space" as Hans Moravec has suggested recently. Future SSIs actually wouldn`t
have to move into different or parallel universes. They could play their
potential mind games in some kind of quantum vacuum that is inaccessible to
human beings. And wouldn`t it be possible that those intelligences are
already present playfully messing around with our nervous systems on this
unapproachable quantum level or - being a little more optimistic -
beautifully shaping and designing our thoughts
and actions ?  Let`s see: will they be using an especially appealing detail
of the cosmic microwave radiation together with the process of
photosynthesis in an maple leaf (make belief) and combine it with the
molecular design of serotonin produced by a human brain in a state of bliss
to generate  . . . what?. . . a posthuman glass bead game or whatever you
may hope is useful and necessary to cope with future developments. Who knows
? I don`t. I was just musing on meaningful patterns.
