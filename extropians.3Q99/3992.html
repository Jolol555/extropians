<a name="3994qlink1">I live in New Hampshire, where men are in touch with their manly sides,
as they should</a> be. Many of the women here, though, while feminine (not
lesbian or feminist, although there are plenty of both of those too) are
far more practically conservative in a libertarian sense than probably
even the majority of the men where you are. They don't care what your
gender preference is, they just don't want you stuffing it down their
throats whenever you are out in public, and they don't want their tax
dollars supporting elaborate social bureaucracies to do so.

"Rigid" gender roles? Excuse me? Gay and bisexual gender roles can be
just as rigidly enforced by a society as straight roles. I imagine that
someone who is straight in the bay area is probably ostracized for his
or her 'perverted' and 'anti-social' sexual preferences (seen it with my
own eyes).

I lived on Capital Hill myself in Seattle for several years. Being the
only straight guy in a bar will demonstrate what I'm saying.
