Maybe that is a common reaction, but it is a logical non sequitor.

<p>
This is the old "Great Chain of Being" idea, originally from Christian
theology. But it is not obvious that one can use the mediocrity
principle to deduce that we are in the middle in the spectrum of
intelligences; we are obviously at the top here on Earth and have no
information about the distribution in the rest of the universe.

<p>
Just because we currently are limited and stupid doesn't mean we
always have to be - what if you extend your reasoning in the temporal
domain?
