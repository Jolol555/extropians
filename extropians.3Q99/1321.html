Ok, what I am trying to say is there is no way to prove any AI design
can approximate human intelligence until we actually do so.  Your design
could show promise however if you manage to actually build a seed-AI
that maximizes its intelligence within the limited hardware we now have
available.  So the question, assuming you are correct is what kind of
artificial intelligence could we run on an existing pentium III?  An ant?
A chicken?  If you could do that, I would be very impressed. :-)
Not only would you prove that your seed-AI has empirical merit, but
you would present convincing evidence that the only remaining
bottleneck is speed.

I guess will see.
