<p>
Extropians,

<p>
	I'm involved in a local atheist group (Atheists of Norther
Colorado) which I've made aware of my attending Extro-4.  They are
very interrested in what's going to be discussed.  They've invited me
to give a summary of Extro-4 talk at their first meeting after the
conference.  They are working on sending out press releases announcing
this local review of this conference to all the local media.

<p>
	Given all the recent Y2K hype, and the Biotech subject this
year, I think this could generate quite a bit of local interest both
in my summary talk, and in extro-4 itself.

<p>
	Heck, I also attend the local Universal Unitarian church and
there seems to be much similar interrest there also; asking me to
hold a special meeting or class where I present extro-4 info.

<p>
	Anyway, I'm surprised how all this spontaneously comes
together and how many diverse organizations are all interrested in
hearing talks about this kind of inspiring stuff.  I just thought I'd
spread the idea of how easy and exciting this has been for me, in case
there are others of you out there involved in any kind of local
organizations where you live that might be interrested in hearing
about this kind of stuff and helping to fan the fires that are
bringing us the future.

<p>
	Looking forward to Extro-4!!

<p>
