It is possible to legally own primates and other exotic animals in many 
places.  But my first advice is that you probably not do it.  The 
circumstances in which humans can keep primates as "pets" are rare and 
difficult to maintain.  (In fact, I believe that it is impossible to 
ethically maintain primates as "pets" -- only as house mates :-)  It only 
works for us for a number of reasons.  First, we have lemurs, which are 
really prosimians, or "proto-primates".  More "advanced" primates are much 
harder to keep because they are too strong to be dealt with in a home 
environment safely or practically (even a spider monkey can wreak utter havoc 
in a home and cause serious injury, even in play).  We've researched more 
"advanced" primates and wouldn't consider them until we make a LOT more 
money.  Second, my wife is an artist who works at home and can be with the 
lemurs almost all of time.  Primates and prosimians are extremely social 
animals and can't be left alone for any length of time without doing them 
psychological injury.  Third, Anthea has a truly extraordinary gift for 
relating to and handling animals of all kinds (remind me to tell you about 
the wild macaws we encountered in Nicaragua . . .) and is super-humanly 
patient with them.  Fourth, you have to be willing to make a very long-term 
commitment to an animal with amazing intelligence, agility and strength that 
will remain essentially at the stage of "terrible twos" for 20-40 years.  
Fifth, we've built special accommodations for the lemurs in our house so that 
they can be themselves and we can be ourselves without driving each other 
crazy. Sixth, you have to have access to medical services which are hard to 
find.  Most vets aren't competent and/or willing to treat primates and most 
human doctors won't.  Finally, you have to find competent care for the 
animals when you want to take a vacation.  If all that doesn't put you off, 
by all means . . . :-)
