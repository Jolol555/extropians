Abstract
<br>
  The aim of this study was to determine the effects of the long-term
  application of various fragrances on the suppression of immune response
  induced by high-pressure stress in mice. The immune response was analyzed
  based on plaque-forming cell (PFC) count, using mice sensitized with sheep
  red blood cells. The decreased PFC involving thymic involution induced by
  high-pressure stress in mice was restored by exposing the stressed mice to
  tuberose, lemon, oakmoss and labdanum for 24 h following exposure to stress.
  The decreased PFC and thymic involution from stress were restored by exposure
  to lemon and oakmoss, but not to tuberose and labdanum when the mice were
  exposed to those fragrances continuously for 3 weeks before the stress was
  given, followed by exposure to the same fragrances for 24 h after the stress.
  The decreased PFC and thymic involution from stress were restored by exposure
  to lemon and labdanum for 24 h after the stress, but not to tuberose over 3
  weeks before the stress was given. These data suggest that the
  neuroimmunomodulatory effects of fragrances may be affected by tolerance
  depending on the kinds of fragrances in the case of a long-term application.
