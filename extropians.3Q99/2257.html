I just wanted to go on record here to say that I am not and have never been
John Grigg, at any moment past or present (could be a borg in my future
though).

<p>
Thanks for the positive response, John. Yes, there's an album which will be
ready by October 1, or else! Um, also a better website will be appearing
shortly. Much as I am loathe to spend money on something that I can get for
free, I am coming around to the idea that the free webspace available is
really a mirage. As I am looking to put up something with a little more
substance than "Hi, my name is Emlyn, here's a picture of my dog" (all of
Geocities?), I'll get a crowbar on to the wallet pronto.

(oh, and because this is a reply I've included the previous message below.
Just in case you haven't already read it. No, no, it's not a sad excuse to
repost public praise. Nooooo!)

<p>
<a href="2251.html#2257qlink1">&gt; Emlyn and Jodie,</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I just want to say publicly how much I love the extropian songs the two of</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; you have written!  I found it very captivating in the style of Enya.  Do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you </i><br>
<i>&gt; do Klingon weddings? lol  I think that Worf or any Klingon about to tie</i><br>
<i>&gt; the </i><br>
<i>&gt; knot would find your compositions very moving!  I mean that as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; compliment </i><br>
<i>&gt; speaking as a trekkie.</i><br>
I would love to do a Klingon wedding. They don't eat the musicians do they?

<p>
<a href="2251.html#2257qlink2">&gt; Also I thought that should a sequel be made to the "Flash Gordon" film</a><br>
<i>&gt; made </i><br>
<i>&gt; around 1980 that was a cult classic you and your wife should work on the </i><br>
<i>&gt; soundtrack.</i><br>
Now I am Freddy Mercury, without the sexual orientation (really, Jodie!).
Fabulous!

<p>
<a href="2251.html#2257qlink3">&gt;   And speaking of sequels...if a "Fifth Element" part two is done </a><br>
<i>&gt; you must do a song for any blue, angel-voiced humanoids!!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I'll have to go see Fifth Element.

<p>
<a href="2251.html#2257qlink4">&gt; I really was dumbfounded that someone would have such musical talent here</a><br>
<i>&gt; on </i><br>
<i>&gt; the list!  You and your wife are just fantastic in my view.  I cannot wait</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; to listen to your next song!  And it was my first time using Mp3 so it was</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; doubly cool!  My school computer labs won't let me use it (for obvious </i><br>
<i>&gt; reasons) so I went to a cyber cafe to listen.</i><br>
There are other musicians out there in Transhuman/Extropian land... maybe
they will show themselves...

<p>
<a href="2251.html#2257qlink5">&gt; It was will worth the cost.  Will you consider coming out with a CD so </a><br>
<i>&gt; people can have something substantial to hold in their hand and put with</i><br>
<i>&gt; the </i><br>
<i>&gt; rest of their CD collection?  Are you gifted when it comes to doing album </i><br>
<i>&gt; cover artwork?</i><br>
CD coming soon (october 1), as I have said above. We'll make it available
via mp3.com, we'll have an address that you can send a check to, plus we'll
look at other avenues. Much of the album will be downloadable for free as
mp3, although mp3 is poorer quality that a CD. Also, we are going to look at
having a software-style arrangement with the CD, where you register, and get
access to a members-only section of our website where stuff is available
only for people who have bought the album. This area would be updated
frequently with new bits and pieces which we put together.

<p>
Artwork, mmm, I've been putting that off. Anyone want to put their hands up?

<p>
<a href="2251.html#2257qlink6">&gt; I wish you both the best in life and with your musical efforts.  Take</a><br>
<i>&gt; care!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Sincerely,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; John Grigg</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Same to you John, thanks again.
<br>
Emlyn
