This is a question within philosophy, if I ever heard one.  In fact, this
is one of the fundamental questions of the philosophy of language.

<p>
Philosophy of mind literature probably collapses.  Philosophy of ethics
doesn't.  Philosophy of language/logic doesn't.

<p>
And you're trying to tell me that this argument is scientific or empirical
somehow?  This is philosophy, through and through; what's more, it's
non-empirical philosophy.  Can you provide an experiment which could
prove/disprove the claim that "to know the conditions of truth you have to
know the construction of the knower"?  If not, then this claim cannot be
proven empirically, which ruins any argument that all philosophy collapses
into empirical science.

<p>
Again, your entire argument is squarely within the philosophy of
language/logic.  In arguing that philosophy is somehow subordinate to
science, you fail to take note of the fact that the whole idea of "logic"
is fundamentally philosophical, both in nature and in origin.
