<p>
To the extent that any part of the future is being created outside the
US, it is typically in those areas where other nations have become
Americanized (not cracks about MacDonalds cheeseburgers)... Only a hard
line Communist would continue to argue that it is not chiefly the Pax
Americana which has engendered the current state of things.

<a name="2529qlink2"><a href="2503.html#2522qlink2">&gt; Yes. Academic psychology has fallen on hard times here in Australia. But</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt;    National SOCIALIST Party.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;That is the name which Hitler chose: he may be a qualified judge, no?</i><br>

<a name="2529qlink5">fascist: one who beleives that the will and needs of the state as a

<br>
socialist: one who beleives the will and needs of society as a whole</a> is
paramount.

<p>
The only difference is the fascist is more of a realist in acknowledging
that in a centralized society, the state is the society. The socialist
continues to lie to himself and others on this point....until they have
successfully stripped the individual of all rights and power. Note how
Musssolini and Franco, the fascists, were allied with Hitler the
socialist, and how easily Hitler made peace with his Communist
counterpart, Stalin, and used his socialist puppets, Le Pen and
Quisling.

<p>
And I do consider myself highly enlightened, thank you...
