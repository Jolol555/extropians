Analysis of Landforms in Cydonia Mensa

Abstract: Analysis of landforms in Cydonia mensa reveals a variety of 
features whose probable means of formation is ground-ice and perhaps 
liquid water erosion. Some evidence of faulting exists. We examine and 
compare some of these landforms. We show that a group of mound-like 
formations in the Cydonia area of Mars, of relatively small and nearly 
uniform size, have relative positions that repeatedly display symmetries 
in the apparent form of related right and isosceles triangles. We also 
show that these pairs cluster sharply in density about a certain value 
of the defining angle of those related triangles and that on average the 
vertices of the triangles lie significantly closer to the measured 
centers of the mounds than those for fictitious mounds from a computer 
simulation. Our computer simulation of the surrounding features and the 
mound formations themselves demonstrates that the numerous examples of 
these symmetries, the resultant clustering about certain proportions, 
and the relative precision of the vertices to the mound centers are not 
compatible with random geological forces. We have thus uncovered an 
anomaly of number, geometry and precision. The level of significance we 
find for our test is p~15.5/1,000,000 .

Evidence for a Paleo-Ocean Shoreline, Sedimentary Features and Water 
Erosion in Cydonia
<br>
Erjavec, J and Brandenburg, J E (P42A-10) 


<p>
Abstract: Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) images of the Cydonia Mensae region 
of Mars have provided evidence that suggests surface water activity of a 
long duration. Scarp lines identified by Viking, considered as possible 
shoreline features (1), have been reanalyzed using the higher resolution 
MGS images. The scarps define a boundary between two different terrain 
types, one representing a knobby terrain (highland) and the other a 
possible paleo-ocean(2) (lowland). Because of the persistence of the 
curvilinear scarps and their offset from the knobby terrain which they 
circumvent, they cannot easily be regarded as simple remnants of eroded 
knobby terrain. The scarps appear similar to strandline or shoreline 
features which occur on earth. That interpretation is supported by the 
morphological characteristics of the two terrain types they dissect. 

<p>
Volcanic flows have been suggested as explanations for many of the 
varied terrain types on mars, including kilometers of layered rocks in 
the Valles Marineris. In the Cydonia region, volcanic flows are not 
likely as land- forming mechanisms. There appear to be no significant 
volcanic sources in this region nor can the distinctive erosion 
morphologies of many of the landforms in Cydonia be easily attributed to 
volcanism. To the contrary, some of the erosion appears to be 
structurally controlled, perhaps by faults, layered rocks or even folded 
sediments. Furthermore, evidence for both erosion and deposition by 
water is strong in Cydonia. Terraces (wave-cut?), benches, probable 
sedimentary layering, stream channels and other water erosion features 
have been found in the MGS images. 

<p>
Evidence also exists for both precipitation and surface runoff. Apparent 
rills are found on some of the landforms and they appear markedly 
similar to rill types found in sedimentary terrains in the western 
United States. Still, caution must be taken when using strict 
earth-based analogies for martian terrains. If martian terrains 
developed under a gravitational field that was only 1/3rd that of the 
earth, can we be certain that depositional and erosional environments on 
the earth directly correlate to similar environments on mars? Taking 
that into consideration and despite strong evidence for water in 
Cydonia, we propose that the typical tributary stream networks common on 
earth may not be as common on mars on the basis of the different 
gravitational field strength.

Ice Found in Crater in Cydonia
<br>
Moore, H L, Brandenburg, J E, Corrick, S, Sirisena, A (P42A-15 ) 


<p>
Abstract: Review of recent Mars Global Surveyor images taken on April 
23, 1998 has revealed unusual surface craters located at 40.9 degrees 
north latitude and 9.9 degrees west longitude. Unusual crater features 
disclosed in the recent MGS Image (strip No.3, Cydonia) indicates that 
water ice features may exist in the Cydonia area and appear to correlate 
to similar features in Iceland. Specific crater features found include, 
a smooth, flat floor surface, high albedo floor surface, a reflection of 
the floor surface on the crater wall, no apparent ejecta apron, and 
steep crater walls. Several studies have identified and compared surface 
features on Mars to like features on Earth, which contain water ice, 
including features on the landmass of Iceland (Frey Et Al, 1979; Hodges 
and Moore, 1978). Other studies indicate that there is a high 
probability of water ice at latitudes greater than 40 degrees north on 
Mars (Carr, 1981; Allen, 1979; Soderblom and Wenner, 1978). 

<p>
Several possible explanations for the presence of water ice in the floor 
of the subject crater are presented. Two scenarios presented involve a 
meteor or comet hitting the surface and excavating the crater. The 
meteor/comet impact is suggested to be significant enough to generate 
heat to either: (a) melt water ice in the regolith and bedrock or (b) 
crack the crust to permit molten rock to reach close enough to the 
surface materials to melt frozen water in the bedrock and soil which 
then flowed into the crater and re-froze. This new frozen surface forms 
the current flat crater floor. 

<p>
Another idea presented is the possible daily melting of near surface ice 
in the soil and rock. This is supported by recent new evidence from the 
NASA Pathfinder project that shows that temperatures on the surface of 
Mars reach 20 degrees C. in places, making melting of surface water ice 
possible. Also discussed is the possible establishment of a water table 
frozen in place at some point in the geologic history of Mars.
