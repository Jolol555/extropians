<p>
I think the impetus of expansion into space should be driven by
autonomous, partial- or full-closure autoreplicators, whether macro
(minimechanics and MEMS) or nano (drextech). For this, manned 
spaceflight is but a distraction, and a possible resource drain.

<p>
What is necessary is cheap delivery to LEO, which is primarily pushed
by conventional satellite industry, and parallel terrestrial research
in space simulators for the development of lunar and asteroid
industrial processes. This might eventually require microgravity
experiments, but this is nothing that cannot be handled by
automation/unmanned flight. I realize that the state of the art in
automation/robotics is not exactly awe-inspiring, but this should not
be glossed over by relying on monkey power. If there are deficits,
let's address them now, since we *will* have to deal with them later.

could follow (if there are still any around,</a> that is).

<p>
<a name="0789qlink2">Imho, manned spaceflight is only tolerable as long as it advances the
state of the art/mobilizes the resources otherwise wasted elsewhere.</a>

<p>

counterarguments.</a>
