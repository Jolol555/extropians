<p>
Of course: private key encryption with or without quantum key exchange.

<p>
<a name="0472qlink2"><a href="0352.html#0463qlink2">&gt; So taking Ockham's Razor, which of the following would you choose:</a><br>

<p>
Occam's Razor is great for playing the odds, but it doesn't prove anything.</a>

<p>
<a name="0471qlink2"><a href="0352.html#0463qlink3">&gt; So, for the SETI@home project to work, as has been suggested, by</a><br>
<i>&gt; "evesdropping" on similar level civilizations, they would have to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be within ~100 light years of us.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0472qlink3">Or, as has already been pointed out, they could have been farther away but
further advanced: e.g., 200 light years away, 200 years ahead of us.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; If they are beyond that their</i><br>
<a href="0352.html#0463qlink4">&gt; signals would have already passed us by.  If</a> you plug the number</a><br>
<a name="0472qlink4"><i>&gt; of Earth-like planet supporting stars in 100 cubic light years</i><br>
<i>&gt; into the Drake equation</i><br>

<p>
Er, shouldn't that be "the number of Earth-like planet supporting stars in a
sphere of 100 light years radius"? More like 31000 cubic light years. and
that's not even taking into account the previous point regarding the 100 ly
number.</a>

<p>
<a href="0352.html#0463qlink5">&gt; So, when I go through all this stuff carefully, I reach the</a><br>
<i>&gt; conclusion that SETI@home will not work and people have just</i><br>
<i>&gt; been hoodwinked.</i><br>

<p>
Nobody here thinks that SETI will *probably* detect an ETI. It seems silly
not to try, though.

<p>
<a href="0352.html#0463qlink6">&gt; The question is whether you have "thinking" time to spend</a><br>
<i>&gt; on it or just "computer" time.  If you have just computer</i><br>
<i>&gt; time there isn't any game other than SETI@home.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0472qlink5">Sure there is: RC5 and GIMPS are two, there are many others.</a>

<p>
<a href="0352.html#0463qlink7">&gt; But to</a><br>
<i>&gt; my mind you should put the SETI@home computers in suspend mode</i><br>
<i>&gt; and donate the value of the electricity saved to an organization</i><br>
<i>&gt; that can pay someone to write a competing application to do</i><br>
<i>&gt; an analysis of the 2MASS data.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0472qlink6">Which organization is accepting donations for that? If there isn't one, why
don't you form one?</a> Do something more constructive than telling people
running SETI@home that they're dupes.

<p>
<a href="0352.html#0463qlink8">&gt; First you have to get the SETI people to see the possibility,</a><br>
<i>&gt; and since they have been at this for nearly 35 years in</i><br>
<i>&gt; the face of virtually no results, it is going to take some</i><br>
<i>&gt; *strong* arguments to shake their "faith".</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0472qlink7">No you don't. You can ignore the SETI people completely.</a>

<p>
<a href="0352.html#0463qlink9">&gt; ...  What I'm dissing on is the fact that the SETI people</a><br>
<i>&gt; gloss over some of the details (like the transmitter power</i><br>
<i>&gt; requirements) that make people think the probability for</i><br>
<i>&gt; aliens that we can communicate with is &gt;&gt; 1 instead of &lt;&lt; 1.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You never hear about these things unless you delve into</i><br>
<i>&gt; the literature in some detail.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0471qlink3">Even Joe Sixpack knows that SETI isn't guaranteed to find anything. That's
why they call it a "search".
