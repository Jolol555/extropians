As I said, "the wavefunction ... is no less real than anything else."

For now it's open to interpretation.  My preference, given the choice, would
be MWI over observer collapse.  But you may as well just run with neither
until you're given a reason to think otherwise.

<i>&gt; is possibly right, if you do see interference bands Copenhagen is dead and</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; There are only two possible outcomes, what's your prediction, do we get</i><br>

<p>
I may have missed something but it seems to me that Deutsch's experiment
would only disprove observer collapse, which was silly to start with.
