<p>
I've been thinking about the situation in Russia, especially

<UL>
  <li>  the oligarchy that has developed and their emphasis on
   stealing and hiding as many assets as possible
  <li>  the fact that there seems to be so little awareness of
   the ideas we discuss in Russia
  <li>  the fact that "hope" has been crushed from the people
   multiple times over the last ten years
  <li>  my impression that the Russian people have an very
   high standard of family values and are willing to make
   significant sacrifices so their children can be better off
  <li>  the fact that Russia still has a very high number of
   highly trained scientists, mathematicians, etc.
   whose skills are in many cases underutilized or being
   cast aside due to the simple requirements for survival
  <li>  the fact that they still are sitting on enough plutonium
   for something like 10,000 nuclear weapons.


</UL>
<p>
<a name="3502qlink1">Given these things, I've been considering writing some pieces
for the Moscow Times (one of the major English language papers
in Russia) about gene-tech, extended longevity, nano-tech,
Extropian/transhumanis ideas, etc. hoping that they might spread
to the Russian papers.</a>

<p>
The reasons to do this might include:

<UL>
  <li>  give the population in general "hope" in the future
  <li>  devaluing the worth of controlling resources or assets
   such as oil/gold/diamonds/metals/etc. 
  <li>  devaluing the worth of power in general
  <li>  providing something for the underutilized minds to do
   (nano-designs, non-self-aware AI, etc.)
  <li>  potentially provide competition to Western efforts that
   could make things go faster


</UL>
<p>
<a name="3614qlink2">However, this is a very tricky thing to do and could put me
on the bad side of some very nasty people.</a>  In reviewing the
discussions by den Otter, Eliezer, et. al., it seems evident 
that the things I need to make clear in any such articles,
seem to be poorly understood even in this group.

<p>
<a name="3614qlink3">So I want to float some ideas.

<p>
<a name="3594qlink1">We still seem to a large degree to focus discussions on
</a>
concepts that I suspect will be irrelevant.  If we assume that:
  (a) nanotech makes the Bill Gates lifestyle possible.
  (b) Since there are many places (Australia, U.S., Canada,
<pre>
      oceans, etc.) that have much more land/surface area than is
      required to provide power for their population, it would
      seem that during the nanotech-transition that these "free"
      areas could be opened to settlement from overcrowded 
      countries or those with oppressive governments.</a>
  (c) So we should see a migration to the places that provide
      the freedom level that individuals prefer.

</pre>
<p>
<a name="3614qlink4">Now, this implies that governments now have to either:
(a) imprison their citizens; or (b) compete with each
other to provide maximal freedom.  Assuming (a) doesn't occur,
I presume that this stabilizes around some "maximally" free
point where some societies allow you to do self-destructive
things (thrill seeking recreational activities) and some
discourage it.  Since everyone is aware of the dangers
of nanotech, everyone actively participates in verification
and self-policing of the designs.  Since everyone is virtually
wealthy, you don't need to pay any bureaucrats, run subsidized
programs, worry about retirement funds, etc. etc.  Because
of the wealth &amp; migration possibilities, war seems obsolete.
The risk-benefit tradeoff seems completely unjustifiable.
<a name="3594qlink2">It seems the role of government gets very small.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3614qlink5">And yet we seem to focus huge amounts of conversation
</a>
on what governments will or will not<a name="3594qlink3"> do.  We don't
</a>
seem to be able to climb out of the current system
enough to see what the new<a name="3594qlink4"> system will look like.</a>
And if I can't communicate that then the articles
are unlikely to have the impact I want.
</a>

<p>
<a name="3594qlink5">Some people seem to have a fair amount of fear that
</a>
nanotech is a bad thing and if so, the promotion of
<a name="3594qlink6">a U.S.-Russia nanotech race would not be good.  But
</a>
if it were combined with the perspective that such
a race could not be "won" for long (as with the
nuclear race)<a name="3594qlink7"> and that winning such a race would
</a>
essentially make governments obsolete then it
would appear<a name="3594qlink8"> that governments have the most to
</a>
fear from nanotech.  I'm assuming here that winning
the race does<a name="3594qlink9"> not allow you to turn the other country
</a>
into grey-goo because the other side anticipates
this<a name="3594qlink10"> and has nano-tech stopping radiation sources
</a>
available.  This goes back to my extensive discussion
<a name="3594qlink11">that SI "wars" shouldn't occur, because you have to guarantee
</a>
that you wipe out every last spec of nanotech belonging
to the opposing side.

<p>
Thoughts?
