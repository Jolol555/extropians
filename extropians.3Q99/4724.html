<p>
Sorry I didn't express myself clearly.
<br>
I was referring to hunter-gatherer situations vs those
from places like the  US/Australia. A "primitive"
hunter would have the feeding motivation as well as
enjoyment of the hunt itself.
  
<p>
If I was living in the wilds I would have no
compunction about hunting what I needed to eat, if
necessary. I'm not interested in *shooting* things
otherwise though.

<p>
Actually I'd really like to see these. I found stuff
on crime rates at <a href="http://www.justicefellowship.org/">http://www.justicefellowship.org/</a>
but this doesn't differentiate between hunters and
non-hunters. 

<p>
<a href="4711.html#4724qlink3">&gt; And what is a domestic carnivore? Hannibal Lecter?</a><br>

<p>
:) No, I'd never hire help like that!
 
<p>
I was thinking of ferrets, etc. With ferrets as an
example,those that have been trained to hunt tend to
be more aggressive than those raised purely as pets.
Of course a lot of this might be related to their
general treatment. And a ferret is not a primate. The
further we get away from primates, the more unreliable
an animal model becomes.

<p>
I said that one **might** argue that people could get
"blooded" by the experince of killing, not that it was
necessarily true. And people might eventually become
revolted by the process.  

<p>
In fact my grandfather hunted and shot many kangaroos
(they were  considered a pest in Central Queensland),
but eventually renounced it altogether.

<a href="4711.html#4724qlink4">&gt; It is not a 'violent' urge that is</a><br>

<p>
<a href="4711.html#4724qlink5">&gt; You ignore</a><br>
<i>&gt; human evolution at your own peril.</i><br>

<p>
OK "violent urge" was a bit lurid, that was prompted
by 
<br>
thinking about killing in particular.

<p>
Do our instincts have to be satisfied by killing,
necessarily, or just the activity of tracking and
pursuit? Pursuit can indeed be stimulating, I think we
*do* have this in our bones. 
 
<p>
Having worked as a volunteer rural fire fighter, it
seems there can even be a sort of "hunt mentality"
involved with tracking down and fighting a fire.

<p>
A wildlife photographer is also involved in a hunt of
a sort, certainly they have to track their quarry, lie
in wait for it, second guess it, etc.

<p>
I did *not* advocate ignorance of human evolution.
It's how you deal with it.

<p>
But you cannot ignore all the other factors
influencing behaviour. Merely reducing it instincts
and g*n laws
<br>
isn't enough.
