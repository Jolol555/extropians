<a name="2609qlink1"><i>&gt; Phil, your post was looking so good until it got this fantastic injection</i><br>
<i>&gt; of mysogeny! It's such a bummer to see you mix in the following paragraph</i><br>
<i>&gt; with an otherwise very informative piece on Montessori schools. It brings</i><br>
<i>&gt; the credibility of the whole post down.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="2609qlink2"><a href="2535.html#2604qlink1">&gt; Women - not all of them, obviously, but way too many - are anti-rational</a><br>
<i>&gt; and </i><br>
<i>&gt; consistently resist science and technology.  Look at how they waited until</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; computers became "fashinable" to finally adopt them.  As an educational </i><br>
<i>&gt; consultant in the '80's, I could talk for hours about this one.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; Amerika </i><br>
<i>&gt; distrusts people who are too smart, as in "Mad Scientists."  So it's a</i><br>
<i>&gt; hard </i><br>
<i>&gt; sell culturally and then you have active, dedicated thoroughly evil </i><br>
<i>&gt; opposition who happen to control the state-financed compulsory education</i><br>
<i>&gt; and </i><br>
<i>&gt; its propaganda apparatus - the schools themselves.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="2609qlink3">I send my daughter to a preschool which is run along Montessori lines, and
she thrives there. This was after some false starts at more "conventional"
(f*cked up) schools which seemed more interested in breaking individualism
and getting that institutional mindset going as early as humanly possible. I
remember seeing my daughter, along with the rest of the kids at one
preschool, running around in the playground wearing the school hat (I hadn't
known there was a school hat). They just had to have some kind of uniform.
When I asked about it, I got the usual line (which we all probably have come
across) about engendering equality in the children. Yes sir, yes sir, three
bags full.

<p>
What are other parents on this list doing about education? I can't imagine
that the anti-death&amp;taxes types hanging around extropians are going for the
marching-up-and-down-the-square type of set up that conventional schooling
offers.

<p>
Emlyn thank you sir may I please have another
