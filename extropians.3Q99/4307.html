Have you seen women's boxing?  Holy schlaMOLY these young
ladies are tough!  Unlike the men, who play as one would expect
from those participating in a damanding and perhaps brutal sport,
the ladies play as if they would like to kill each other.  Perhaps it
is a selection thing too: only the most... enthusiastic women go
into the sport, whereas many young men box just because it is
the thing to do.

I will gaze into my crystal ball, extrapolate on all the extreme
sports that are coming into fashion, and predict that within
5 years, we will see intergender boxing.  Furthermore, if the
contestants are matched pound for pound, I suspect the
women will make quite a respectable showing, and god
help the man who underestimates his opponent.  spike
