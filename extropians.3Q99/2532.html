Abstract
<br>
  The antioxidative effects of grape seed
  proanthocyanidins (GSPC) were studied in three in-vitro models in which
  polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) in aqueous solution and mice liver or
  brain microsomes were used as oxidative substrates, and UV-C irradiation as
  the pro-oxidant system. Analysis of UV-C induced lipid peroxidation was
  carried out by two methods: gas liquid chromatography of residual PUFAs and
  release of thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances (TBARs) measured by TBA
  reaction. Results indicate that PUFAs are more radiosensitive when
  incorporated in single component micelles than in mixed component micelles or
  microsomes. In every case, PUFA peroxidation was inhibited by low
  concentrations of GSPC (2 mg/L) while epigallocatecin (EGC) and
  epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) monomers, at an equivalent level of
  epicatechin, exhibited no efficacy in our experimental conditions. This
  latter effect might be explained by a synergistic action of flavan-3-ol
  monomers, dimers and oligomers contained in the grape
  seed extract.

Abstract
<br>
  Proanthocyanidins, a group of polyphenolic bioflavonoids, have been reported
  to exhibit a wide range of biological, pharmacological and chemoprotective
  properties against oxygen free radicals. We have assessed the
  concentration-dependent oxygen free radical scavenging abilities of a
  grape seed proanthocyanidin extract (GSPE),
  vitamin C and vitamin E succinate (VES) as well as superoxide dismutase,
  catalase and mannitol against biochemically generated superoxide anion and
  hydroxyl radical using a chemiluminescence assay and cytochrome c reduction.
  A concentration-dependent inhibition was demonstrated by GSPE. At a 100 mg/l
  concentration, GSPE exhibited 78-81% inhibition of superoxide anion and
  hydroxyl radical. Under similar conditions, vitamin C inhibited these two
  oxygen free radicals by approximately 12-19%, while VES inhibited the two
  radicals by 36-44%. The combination of superoxide dismutase and catalase
  inhibited superoxide anion by approximately 83%, while mannitol resulted in
  an 87% inhibition of hydroxyl radical. The results demonstrate that GSPE is a
  more potent scavenger of oxygen free radicals as compared to vitamin C and
  VES.
