<a href="0416.html#0424qlink1">&gt; &gt; advancing civilization would likely *pass through* the</a><br>

Granted Rob, I could have tightened my arguement a bit.  Any advanced ETI would
understand math.<a name="0559qlink1">  Primes are prime in any base.</a>  Stars emit electromagnetic
radiation.  Beams of radiation can be focussed with lasers.  All ETIs can
distinguish between high frequencies and low.  So, if ANY advanced ETI
wished to intentionally com with us, she would send a bitstream of high
and low frequencies, in some form of EMR, the total number of bits
being the product of two primes, which would encourage one to
put it in a matrix and color the high bits to form a picture.  Even if
the ETI itself has some other means of communication, as we do on
this planet, every ETI that received that signal would know what to
do with it.  spike
