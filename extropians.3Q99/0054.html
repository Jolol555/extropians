<a name="0060qlink1">In the late 70s, I worked with a proto-transhumanist kinda fellow who went 
by his initials (dib).</a> He lived near the office so that he could easily pursue 
his reworked sleep schedule. He tried taking naps that would be exactly 
one REM cycle every six hours or so. Thus, he was sleeping about three 
hours out of 24. Being a serious geek, he tried to be extra precise about 
this. He started by timing his sleep for several nights. If his average sleep 
time (without an alarm) was, say, 7:50, he concluded that his idiosyncratic 
sleep cycle must be 47 minutes instead of 45. So when he started his onerem
 system, he would set an alarm for 47 minutes.

<p>
He seemed to think it worked fine, while most other people seemed to 
think he was groggy all the time. He also decided to simplify a few things 
such as haircuts -- bought a clipper and wore a self-styled buzz -- and 
getting dressed -- he bought jumpsuits in various colors. He carried a 
minirecorder to take notes -- no idea what he did about transcribing them 
or finding any particular memo on the tape. 

<p>
Definitely a fun guy to work with. I lost track of him -- would be interesting 
to find out what he's into now.
