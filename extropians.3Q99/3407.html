<a name="3451qlink1"><a name="3433qlink1">Sorry to disappoint you, but you are actually very normal.</a> The original
1956 paper by George Miller used a 7 item limit more for rhetorical device
than because it was that close to actual limits in humans. Since then it
appears that we have two limits: one associated with phonological
short-term memory and another with visual short-term memory (VSTM).
Phonological short-term memory appears to hold about 2 seconds of
information so if you thinking in Welsh you can hold far fewer words than
if you are thinking in Chinese. VSTM appears to hold around 4, but there is
some variation. In experiments I have been doing for my dissertation I
regularly find subjects that appear to have capacity limits up around 7-8
and others down around 2-3. My own belief is that this is probably an
attentional limit as well (there are various studies suggesting that we can
only attend to about 4 items at a time). There is some disagreement as to
where this limit might be many posit something akin to a high-level buffer
than can only hold an absolute number of items (around 4-5).
</a>

<p>
<a name="3433qlink2">My view (which is controversial) is that the sorts of capacity limits we
see are caused by low-level noise and not a high level capacity limit.
Basically the more things you try to attend to the poorer the quality of
the signal you (more specifically neurons in the prefrontal cortex) have to
work with. Once you get beyond about four 'things' the quality of the
signal drops off quite quickly (though there is no absolute limit to the
number of things that can attended</a> to).
