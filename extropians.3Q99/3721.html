The UN passes resolutions condemning Israel for sunspots!  Dropping a
nuclear bomb would probably result in a UN resolution to declare the
entire Israeli government guilty of crimes against humanity, maybe even
revoke their legitimacy outright - after all, if the UN can grant Israel
sovereignty, doesn't it follow that it can take it away?

<p>
Once Israel used the Bomb against an Arab country, the Arabs would
declare a true religious jihad and they wouldn't stop coming until the
last one had died.  The populace would massacre their own leaders if
they tried to do otherwise.

<p>
<a href="3715.html#3721qlink3">&gt; I doubt the Arabs would consider dropping a bomb (if they</a><br>

<i>&gt; on the other hand, Mecca would certainly not be off the list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see how the Arabs can win playing the game.</i><br>

<p>
Looking over the history of the Arab-Israeli conflict, I would have to
say that I would characterize neither side as being controlled by calm,
consequences-evaluating chess players.
