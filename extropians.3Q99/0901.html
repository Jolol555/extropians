And, N.B., every shaft needed to serve an additional floor takes up
space on _all_ the floors below, so that the space lost to elevators
per added floor increases with the height.  Eventually a point is
reached where the space added by going up one more floor is canceled
by the decrease in usable space on the floors below, so that nothing
is gained -- *assuming* that the idea is to create usable space.  If
you are just trying for a height record, no expense spared, then
presumably you can do at least as well as the natural relief</a> of the
earth's surface, and if you imagine another order-of-magnitude
increase in the strength-to-weight ratio of the materials, then of
course the sky's the limit.
