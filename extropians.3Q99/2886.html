Guys, you are all nice guys and all, and I really enjoyed meeting you
at E4 and all that, and I have nothing against gay men,  but... honest
to god, I really really just dont want to pork any of you.  Under
any conditions.  I would muuuch prefer to ponder the baffling
fairer sex, determine what she wants, make that happen and hope
for the best.  They are worth the effort, never mind offspring, passing
the genes and all that.  {8^D spike
