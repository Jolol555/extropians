Have another look at what he wrote. (I know it's painful.) ST was the last
book he thinks is kinda *okay*, becaue it's a gritty Bildungsroman.</a> It's
<a name="0047qlink4">the later corpus, with its ever-more paternalistic authoritarian
crypto-magic pseudo-rationality that he's offended by, and I think he's
right. I love reading Heinlein, and I adore such usually-abominated fat
tomes such as THE NUMBER OF THE BEAST-- precisely for those inveigling,
insinuating characteristics that Moorcock is (rightly) railing against. I'm
weak, I relish these fairytales in which competent men and superwomen rule
the sevagram by the pure power of their good looks or improbably powerful
minds and bodies or strict adherence to the absolute truths of science
(ha!), but I know they are working to corrode my sense of reality and
decent empathy just as tasty foods seem particularly shaped to destroy my
teeth and bloodvessels.</a>

Aargh. It's STRANGER and the rest of the increasingly self-indulgent books
that Moorcock finds so fatuous and suspect. Jubal rules the roost, even if
the `girls' chuck him in the pool occasionally, because he is the
Silverback with silver in his pocket.<a name="0038qlink1"> Mike the Archangel from Mars is right
because... well, because *that's the way things are*, and he *knows it*
because he can speak *Martian, the Truth Language* and hence kill his
enemies at a thought. A vision of a post-Singularity Power? Maybe - but a
troubling one. Be afraid. Be very afraid.</a>
