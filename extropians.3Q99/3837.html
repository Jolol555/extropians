<i>&gt;From what I read, there is considerable progress in understanding this at</i><br>
the lowest level, particularly with insects, worms, and other relatively
simple animals.  Chemical gradients are established across the developing
organism, (i.e. stronger at one end and weaker at the other), and then
the concentration of the chemical turns on or off various genes which
changes how the cell specializes.

<p>
<a name="3850qlink1">However it would be hard to go from this in the opposite direction
to figure out how to change things so as to produce something very
different.  The overall system is relatively specialized to producing a
particular organism.  You could tweak chemical gradients and maybe get
a sixth finger or something, but you'd need a complete redesign to get
an entirely new shape.</a>

<i>&gt; automaton with a general-purpose computer and mechanisms to </i><br>
<i>&gt; reproduce and drop/detect some alphabet of chemical messages. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Given this idealized scenario, I try to image how to go about </i><br>
<i>&gt; designing a program for automaton 0 that will eventually lead to </i><br>
<i>&gt; some interesting configuration of N automata. (shapes, patterns, </i><br>
<i>&gt; images, etc.) </i><br>

Really it doesn't have to be that hard.  Nanosystems pictures a sort of
factory environment, where you build sub-assemblies which move on conveyor
belts to sites where they are put together into more complex shapes.
All the manufacturing components are in fixed, rigid locations relative
to each other.  They can be connected with electrical or mechanical data
busses where signals can be broadcast.

<p>
<a href="3831.html#3837qlink3">&gt; These are very hard problems to think about - the flow of the system </a><br>
<i>&gt; is extremely complex and dynamic. To predict the behavior of the </i><br>
<i>&gt; system at some point in time, you need to know the complete state </i><br>
<i>&gt; of the system, which requires knowing how the system behaved in </i><br>
<i>&gt; the previous time-step, etc. The feedback process leads to very </i><br>
<i>&gt; simple programs with extremely complicated behavior.  </i><br>

<p>
It's not inherently that much<a name="4530qlink3"> more complicated than</a> a factory or other
system which builds a large structure out of small pieces.  It is
somewhat worse in that the pieces are very small, but still there will
probably be considerable repetition in most objects that we build, so
the actual amount of information needed isn't that bad.

<p>
<a href="3831.html#3837qlink4">&gt; &gt; &gt; How do you deal with the problem of mutation?</a><br>
<i>&gt; [...]</i><br>
<i>&gt; I really meant random bit-flips in the machine's local/working </i><br>
<i>&gt; memory. It seems to be the small you make something the more </i><br>
<i>&gt; vulnerable it is likely to be to cosmic rays, etc. You would certainly </i><br>
<i>&gt; place some kind of error correction mechanism in that memory, but </i><br>
<i>&gt; the shear number of possible events (number of nanites, local </i><br>
<i>&gt; memory size, length of time) makes this a rather expensive </i><br>
<i>&gt; proposition. Maybe you need antibody nanites that float around </i><br>
<i>&gt; checking the program of anyone they bump into and destroying </i><br>
<i>&gt; mutants. </i><br>

<p>
Drexler tries to assume a single-point-failure model.  Any system which
detects that it is not working perfectly simply stops working.  You then
have to design with some redundancy in place, but it looks like that
should not be a show stopper.
