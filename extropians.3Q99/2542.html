<a name="2544qlink1"><i>&gt;Very bad also that they are now shifting government sponsorship of research</i><br>

<i>&gt;the government sponsors particular firms at the cost of other firms, in</i><br>

How much are we as scientists to blame I wonder. Its a simple truth (and so
probably wrong) that Australians don't like research.<a name="2544qlink2"> If the same sorts of
energy spent on football and cricket were spent on sicence and technology
Australia would already have a base a on Mars and another in orbit around
Jupiter. *sigh*.</a>

<p>
Changing the subject: I noticed that you are doing work looking on 'g'. For
my PhD I have been doing work on capacity limits on the number of items
that can be held in visual attention and short-term memory. A casual
observation is that people who are very mathematically inclined seem to
have a much higher capacity than the average person. Does this make any
sense from your own work?
