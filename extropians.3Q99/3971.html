<p>
I second that.  Virginia Postrel is a truly great thinker.

<p>
"The Future and its Enemies" is a great book in many ways, but I had wished
that it was a bit more focused in spots.  Nonetheless, she presents a number
of concepts that are extremely important that it's hard to find a good
treatment of elsewhere.

<p>
I also recommend "25 Years of Reason," which is unfortunately out of print.
I do have a spare copy which I will loan to anyone with a sincere desire to
read it and a promise to get it back to me.  Anyone who does should write me
off list.
