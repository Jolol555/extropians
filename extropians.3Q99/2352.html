<p>
Anyone in a position to evaluate the rather amazing claim below that rat
poison [warfarin] is added to cigarettes in order to protect smokers from
blood clots and heart attacks by thinning the blood?

Dear Citizens, Patriots, Veterans, Smokers, their families, and side-stream
Smokers:

<p>
    Please read this incredible post about the most deadly facts about
tobacco smoke. Even after the $238 billion states' governments and tobacco
industry scam supposedly settled the issue, our government and the tobacco
companies still refuse to reveal to the public the REAL story of the harm
done by tobacco.

<p>
    I will be writing a follow-up to this investigate research report about
the outcome of the $238 billion "settlement" that was supposed to solve the
problems.

<p>
Are Tobacco Companies Clandestinely and Illegally
Treating Smokers Medically Without Their Knowledge?

<p>
Marina Del Rey, CA-  It is now common knowledge; although tobacco companies
still deny it;that smoking, chewing, snuffing, sucking, or using tobacco in
any form can increase a person's risk of developing cancer and
cardiovascular
<br>
diseases.

<p>
     The U. S. Public Health Service, the U. S. Surgeon General, the
American
<br>
Cancer Society, the American Lung Association, and the American Heart
Association all declare and document the health hazards of using tobacco.

<p>
     There is current evidence that tobacco companies have purposely
increased the amount of nicotine;a highly addictive chemical stimulant;in
tobacco in order to get smokers "hooked" and addicted to tobacco.

<p>
     This is to force smokers to continue smoking and using tobacco so that
tobacco companies can maintain their profits and continue operating their
businesses, despite the known disease risks. And smokers have an extremely
difficult time quitting due to the physiological and psychological
addictions
<br>
associated with tobacco use. Not only that, but the 1986 Surgeon General's
Report documents that side-stream, or secondhand smoke, is even more
dangerous and disease-causing to nonsmokers than to smokers.

<p>
     But there is an even more insidious crime being perpetrated against the
public by the tobacco companies and that is that the tobacco companies may
be
<br>
conducting illegal and clandestine human medical treatment and
experimentation without authorization or medical license upon unsuspecting
tobacco users without their knowledge.

<p>
     This medical experimentation is in the form of adding to the tobacco
certain toxic chemicals and medicines in order to secretly prevent and treat
some of the diseases that the tobacco companies allege are not caused by
tobacco.

<p>
     Specifically, the tobacco companies, by their own published admission
in
<br>
their trade publications, introduce a deadly pesticide-rodenticide called
Warfarin or coumarin into the tobacco as a "flavoring." They call it a
<br>
"flavoring" in order to cover up its true identity; that is Rat Poison!<br>

<p>
     What is even more incredible is that the federal Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms (BATF), any doctor, biologist, chemist, or licensed
pest control technician or agency, and even the U. S. Department of
Agriculture, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration, the U. S. Public Health
Service, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA), the Poison Control Center, and
the Center for Disease Control agencies, and the various health
organizations
<br>
listed in the opening paragraph have known that coumarin-like compounds and
Warfarin have been used as the active ingredient in rat poison since 1948.

<p>
     It is unthinkable that these protective agencies and professional
personnel have not been able to "put two-and-two together" and realize that
tobacco companies purposely add coumarin, which is a deadly poison
formulated
<br>
to kill mammals, specifically rodents, into tobacco, thereby making it
extremely dangerous for human consumption.

<p>
     Likewise, it is equally unconscionable that these agencies have known
that coumarin or Warfarin is added to tobacco and they have not banned
either
<br>
the use of coumarin in tobacco or tobacco use itself. Unthinkable and
unconscionable as an this is, even the state of California enacted the Safe
Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 and listed on July 1, 1987
in Chapter 3, Section 12000: Chemicals Known to the State to Cause Cancer or
Reproductive Toxicity that Warfarin (with Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS)
Registry Number 81812), in fact, does cause reproductive toxicity in humans.

<p>
     Isn't it amazing that within only one-half inch to one inch above and
below the name Warfarin in a vertical column of a toxic chemicals list that
tobacco smoke is listed to cause reproductive toxicity in both human mates
and females?

<p>
     By grade school deduction, doesn't it make sense that the reason
tobacco
<br>
smoke causes reproductive toxicity is because of the Warfarin in the
tobacco?
<br>
As incredible as all this may seem, this is not the worst of the bad news!
Scientists worldwide have determined that smoking tobacco, in addition to
causing cancer also causes heart attacks and strokes, or cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases, respectively.

<p>
     The mechanism is essentially the same in both heart attacks, which
affect the heart, and strokes, which affect the brain. Tobacco smoke not
only
<br>
causes constriction of the blood vessels that supply oxygenated blood to the
heart muscle cells and brain cells, but it also causes the blood to form
clots that can occlude blood flow to these highly delicate and sensitive
tissues. If a tiny artery or capillary becomes clogged by a blood clot the
tissue and cells immediately downstream of the blockage starve for oxygen.

<p>
     Within five minutes, irreversible heart and/or brain cell damage and
tissue death occurs which causes the heart attack, or coronary infarct,
and/or cerebrovascular (brain) accident (CVA) or stroke.

<p>
     Just what role do the tobacco companies play in this drama? The tobacco
companies claim that carefully controlled scientific studies have never been
able to prove explicitly or conclusively that tobacco use causes cancer or
any other disease. The only "quasi" proof that the scientific researchers
have been able to produce is through statistics that demonstrate that there
is a very high correlation between tobacco use and cancer and cardiovascular
diseases.

<p>
     But the tobacco companies claim that statistics never proved anything.
In fact, the tobacco industry has been able to show that there are
statistically more nonsmokers who develop cancer and other related diseases
than smokers (and, therefore, smoking doesn't cause cancer and other
diseases, they claim).

<p>
     The current scientific explanation to answer the tobacco industry's
claims is that because a smoker gets a more concentrated dose of tobacco
smoke, a smoker's bodily defense and immune systems are readily activated
due
<br>
to the high concentration of harmful substances taken into the smoker's body
and the smoker is immediately protected. However, in the case of a
nonsmoker,
<br>
the concentration of tobacco smoke inhaled by a nonsmoker from a smoker's
cigarette is much lower; so much so that the nonsmoker's defense systems are
not activated and never get a chance to counteract the effects of the
harmful
<br>
tobacco smoke.

<p>
     Additionally, it has been shown that the mainstream smoke from a
burning
<br>
cigarette being inhaled gets filtered through the length of tobacco and
since
<br>
the combustion temperature is very high, there is a more complete combustion
of tobacco and smoke products making them less toxic. But in the case of
nonsmokers inhaling side-stream or secondhand smoke, the side-stream smoke
burns at a lower temperature which creates much more dangerous and more
toxic
<br>
smoke particles and by-products, thus, making them more harmful to
nonsmokers
<br>
even at a lower concentration of tobacco smoke.

<p>
     But, so what? What does all of this have to do with the tobacco
companies adding rat poison to the tobacco? How do they treat smokers
medically? The rat poison is Warfarin or coumarin-like compounds that are
blood anticoagulants. If tobacco smoke does, in fact, cause blood clots that
block the coronary (heart) arteries and the cerebral (brain) arteries, then
treating smokers, through the tobacco they smoke, with the administration of
an anticoagulant may prevent blood clots from forming.

<p>
     According to the Physician's Desk Reference (PDR), 45th edition, 1991,
Product Information (pp. 547-548) and the United States Pharmacopeia (USP),
1990 edition (pp. 129-131, 699-701) on prescription drugs and medicines,
Warfarin, coumarin, and a similar anticoagulant, Heparin, are used in
surgery
<br>
to prevent blood clots from forming secondary to an operation, such as open
heart surgery, and the treatment for certain blood vessel, heart, and lung
conditions.

<p>
     The contraindications for the use of coumarin and Warfarin in humans
are
<br>
the very same reasons it is used in rat poison. These anticoagulants cause
the tiny capillaries and blood vessels to leak blood and cause internal
bleeding or hemorrhage. In rats and in humans they cause gastrointestinal,
genitourinary, and respiratory tract bleeding, in addition to
cerebrovascular
<br>
hemorrhage and cerebral and aortic aneurysms.

<p>
     In essence, rats and humans bleed to death internally and externally,
which can be caused by capillary damage and/or very slight injuries or bumps
and bangs, similar to the physiological effects caused by the deadly Ebola
virus (hemorrhagic fever) infection. Warfarin does cause extensive liver,
kidney, and adrenal gland damage as well.

<p>
     Dr. Donald Frear in Chemistry of the Pesticides (pp. 437-443) states
that "the ideal rodenticide has been deemed as being odorless, tasteless and
inevitably fatal, although it should be slow acting in order that all
rodents
<br>
in the area will have an opportunity to consume the poison without becoming
suspicious."

<p>
     He continues that "the symptoms of acute poisoning should be absent, to
avoid bait shyness, and the manner of death should be such that no
suspicions
<br>
are aroused in the rodent population surviving."

<p>
     This same non-suspicious reaction is present in tobacco smokers.

<p>
     William Hallenbeck and Kathleen Cunningham-Burns in Pesticides and
Human
<br>
Health (p. 15) state that Warfarin and coumarin-like compounds are
<br>
"anticoagulants and antimetabolites of vitamin K and inhibit the synthesis<br>
of
<br>
prothrombin (the clotting agent in blood). They explain that "repeated
exposure is usually required for damage to occur," and that "numerous small
exposures may be more damaging than one large dose" They also say that
<br>
"since<br>
<br>
the rodents do not develop bait shyness they are fed to capacity until
death."

<p>
     The same is true For tobacco smokers (they are fed tobacco smoke to
capacity
<br>
until death by cancer, heart attack, or stroke).

<p>
     The Association of American Pesticide Control Officials, Inc., in
Pesticide Chemical Compendium, 1959 edition (p. 272) states that Warfarin
<br>
"kills by causing hemorrhage when ingested over a period of days," and that<br>
"death (is caused) without evident pain or violent reactions; autopsy shows<br>
hemorrhage, hematomas, internal organs pale from oxygen lack."

<p>
     The PDR (pp. 547-548), also, states that Warfarin can cause spontaneous
abortions, fatal hemorrhage to the fetus in utero, and birth malformation in
children born to women treated with Warfarin during pregnancy. The PDR (pp.
547-548) warns that "the most serious risks associated with anticoagulant
therapy are hemorrhage in any tissue or organ" and necrosis and/or gangrene
of the skin and other tissues which have led to death and/or permanent
disability. "Severe cases have necessitated debridement or amputation of the
affected tissue, limb, breast or penis."

<p>
     Therefore, it is very likely that the tobacco companies are hiding
behind a curtain of clandestine deception, in one instance denying the
dangers of heart attacks and strokes in smokers (because of "lack of
proof"),
<br>
and in the next instance medically treating smokers to prevent them from
developing coronary occlusions and strokes due to blood clots with the
induction or Warfarin or coumarin in the tobacco.

<p>
     It is time for our protective health agencies to analyze the morbidity
and death statistics of smokers (and nonsmokers who work and live around
smokers) to determine if there is a higher incidence of hemorrhage-type of
disorders in them. Incidentally, even if coumarin added to tobacco could
prevent clot-type strokes in the brain, an overdose in very small quantities
over a long period of time could cause a bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke
which
<br>
is just as devastating.

<p>
     Is the tobacco industry practicing medicine without a license? Are the
tobacco companies secretly adding coumarin or Warfarin to their tobaccos in
a
<br>
clandestine attempt to prevent or reduce some incidences of blood
clot-caused
<br>
coronaries and cerebrovascular accidents that they will not admit to
publicly?


<OL>
  <li>  A. Shmuk in volume III of The Chemistry and Technology of Tobacco,
published in 1953 (pp. 548-555) states that coumarin and methylcoumarin were
introduced into tobacco as an "aromatizer." Akehurst in Tobacco, 1966, (pp.
410-475) states that additives and flavorings are added to tobacco to
improve
it for two main reasons: "1) To mask faults such as bitterness, and
generally
soften the smoking taste and, with the aid of perfumes, to create a pleasing
aroma from the tobacco. 2) To retain moisture and make the tobacco less
susceptible to changes in atmospheric conditions."


</OL>
<p>
     Akehurst (p. 473) continues that of the many different additives used
in
<br>
tobacco, the tonka bean whose active ingredient is coumarin, "emphasizes and
holds the natural flavor sensations of the tobacco blend." Editor Ernst
Voges
<br>
in Tobacco Encyclopedia, 1986, states that the allegations made against
tobacco as being a cause of lung cancer and other diseases have not been
proven. He says that "most of the allegations against smoking are based on
'statistical associations' found in epidemiological studies." And that it is
agreed among scientists "that a statistical association does not establish
causation" (p. 460).

<p>
     One additional reason coumarin and sweeteners such as sugars are added
to tobacco is because tobacco smoke is so harsh and toxic that a person
would
<br>
cough out the smoke before the addictive nicotine would have a chance to be
drawn into the lungs and absorbed. The sweeteners allow the smoke to go into
the lungs and remain long enough for the smoker to get his or her addictive
<br>
"fix."<br>

<p>
     Times staff writers Minnie Bernardino (September 26, 1985) and Joan
Drake (October 22, 1987) have written in the Los Angeles Times newspaper
that
<br>
the imitation vanilla, "Mexican vanilla," which is made from the tonka bean,
a member of the pea family, contains coumarin which was banned by the U. S.
Food and Drug Administration in the 1950s because researchers found that
coumarin caused liver damage when fed to rats. The National Academy of
Sciences in Toxicants Occurring Naturally in Foods ,1973, ( pp. 453-455)
adds
<br>
that coumarin has caused growth retardation and testicular atrophy in dogs
and bile-duct carcinoma in cats.

<p>
     So, why does the U. S. Food and Drug Administration not stop the
tobacco
<br>
companies from using coumarin in tobacco? The reason is bureaucratically
simple: Tobacco is not controlled by the Food and Drug Administration but by
the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms which does not regulate food.
And, as it was explained to us by a very high ranking technical official at
the BATF, Scientific Services Chemist John Steele, via telephone
conversation
<br>
on March 30, 1991, although the tobacco companies are prohibited from using
coumarin as a food additive, they secretly import it dissolved in alcohol.
Alcohol is not regulated as a food and the BATF has no guidelines or
regulations regarding coumarin dissolved in alcohol.

<p>
     So, the tobacco companies get away with medical malpractice and,
literally, murder (deaths of smokers due to heart attacks, strokes, and
cancer), all in the name of business viability and profits.

<p>
     Oh, by the way, we started this research project in 1987 when we found
out from a list of chemicals found in tobacco published in the Los Angeles
Times that coumarin was listed by the tobacco companies as a "flavoring." It
is unbelievable that mainstream America and its protective government
agencies still don't know its ramifications! On March 30, 1991, we called
the
<br>
BATF and asked them for a list of ingredients of additives in tobacco. We
were told that there is a list but it is not available to anyone because it
involved patented proprietary trade secret formulas and recipes that not
even
<br>
the U. S. Congress had access to. This is now the summer of 1997, and we
still don't know if the tobacco companies have voluntarily divulged their
<br>
"trade secret" formula tobacco additives.<br>

<p>
     With the information related above, it is our sincere conviction that
the tobacco companies know of the dangers of using coumarin in tobacco, and
that they may be clandestinely and deceptively attempting to medically treat
smokers to prevent "coronaries" and strokes through the action of coumarin.
This could also be an attempt to throw off the statistics that show tobacco
causes these cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases. At any rate, the
tobacco companies should be investigated for performing human medical
experimentation without authorization and practicing medicine without a
license or the informed consent of the smokers involved.

<p>
     Additionally, the tobacco companies should be investigated for sneaking
coumarin through the regulatory agency loopholes, especially in light of the
fact that coumarin has been banned for use in food and its use must be
prescribed by a licensed physician, as patients must be continuously
monitored for any adverse reactions.

<p>
     To prove to yourself that coumarin and Warfarin are used as rat poison,
just go down to the nearest supermarket and read the label on a package of
d-CON Ready Mixed Generation II Kills Rats and Mice advanced anticoagulant
formula rodenticide rat poison. If you see any word that refers to
anticoagulant, Warfarin, or any scientific chemical that has the word root
of
<br>
"-coum-" in it, you should be convinced.<br>

<p>
     One last thought regarding tobacco and its alleged cause of lung
cancer.
<br>
It has already been proven that any form of radioactive contamination or
radiation causes many types of malignant tumors or cancer. It is absolutely
incredible to us that the tobacco companies and the U. S. Department of
Agriculture both know that tobacco leaves have unsafe quantities of
radioactive elements and isotopes that emit alpha, beta, and gamma radiation
and, yet, they still claim that tobacco does not cause lung cancer.

<p>
     T. C. Tso writes in Physiology and Biochemistry of Tobacco Plants,
1972,
<br>
(pp. 91-99) a publication from Plant Science Research Division of the U. S.
Department of Agriculture, that many publications from 1953 through 1970
report the presence of gamma, alpha and beta radiation in leaf tobacco and
tobacco smoke. In fact, there is so much radiation that the publication
states that "most research efforts conducted by plant scientists in the
radioelement area are aimed toward identifying the source of radiation and
toward finding means for reduction or removal' (p. 92). There is so much
radiation that they have been able to devise intricate tables of the
radionuclides and the decay scheme of uranium series. Some of the
radioactive
<br>
isotopes found in tobacco are radioactive potassium, rubidium, strontium,
cesium, radium, polonium, radon, uranium, ionium, astatine, and lead.

<p>
     If even low levels of radiation from radon, radium, and uranium can
cause cancer; specifically lung cancer; why can't radioactive contamination
in tobacco cause cancer? How can the tobacco companies say tobacco does NOT
cause lung cancer? More importantly, how can the U. S. Department of
Agriculture develop the body of knowledge of radiation in tobacco, then sit
idly by and not divulge the information, especially in light of the current,
June 1997, negotiations between 40 state's attorney's general and the
tobacco
<br>
industry here in America?
