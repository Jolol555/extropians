Regarding BDSM and feminism, there was an interesting development on that
last month.  The National Organization for Women has long had a policy
statement saying that BDSM and portrayals thereof degrade women and promote
violence against women.  The minority within NOW that disagreed with that
finally got a coalition together, with support from the National Coalition
for Sexual Freedom.  They hosted a series of discussions on the topic, and
went to the NOW national convention.  

<p>
<a name="4532qlink1">Two of my friends were involved with this, and they were just worn out by
the end. But, the NOW policy was rewritten to show a neutral stance on
BDSM, a victory of rational feminism.  Next stop, the porno policy.</a>
