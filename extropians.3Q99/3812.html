I do not totally agree with this part.  Science tells us what the universe
*is*, engineering predicts what we can do with it, and when we do, that is
technology.  The popular press confuses all this on a regular basis, which
leads people to resent scientists for some undesirable use of technology.</a></a>

<a name="4504qlink2">Scientists use technology to get data about the universe, from which, they
tell us more about what it is.  Engineers use the theory from science to
develop new technology.  This bootstrap process is self sustaining, and that
is one of the reasons why it keeps going no matter what anyone likes or
doesn't like about the results.  I do not think there is any "should do"
going on here, it just does.</a>

<a name="4504qlink3">IMHO the universe (given its large expanse of time and space)  follows the
following rule:

Anything that can happen, will happen, somewhere, sooner or later.</a>

integrity to last long enough for you to notice it.
