&gt;&gt; Maybe, but an individual's life can't be

Correct.

<p>
Incorrect. (And close-minded, insulting, and, in truth, bespeaking a bad, if not
at all unusual, education.)

<p>
Philosophy means, among many other things, subjecting the terms on which science
operates themselves to verification.<a name="3561qlink3"> To take your definition, philosophy would
try to understand, and validate, what is meant by "knowledge,"</a> and "empirical"
(and, for that matter, "verification").

<p>
Philosophy is very hard, though, and I can certainly understand, and even
sympathise with, your reaction formation against it.

<p>
Best,

Brian.
