I believe that in the majority of cases where the intended victim is armed, the
criminal successfully flees.

If you want to insure consistent punishment, I think camera technology superior.
Cameras can record criminals in the act during all types of crimes (the victem need
not be present).  You don't have problems with victims being caught unaware (even
armed cops get killed sometimes) or the problem that women tend to have of being
too afraid to use a weapon.  You don't have to send out the paramedics and waste
space in emergency rooms. You don't have to try to figure out what happened after
the fact. And your ex-girl friend can't tear her dress, shoot you, and then claim
you attempted to rape her.
