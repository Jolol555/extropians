<a name="2980qlink1"><a name="2937qlink1">Well, my questions to Robert Freitas regarding the "hypsithermal limit"
<br>
(heat tolerance of the planet), have drawn a response.<br>

<p>
[Yes, I am an angel from god...</a> :-)]

<p>
<a name="2980qlink2">And the conclusions are not much different.  He basically says
that from the conservative to the optimistic sides we are limited
to 100-1000 KW/person.  That is pretty much what I had said
with my 400 KW.  If you want more, you have to borrow or buy
from someone else (if you are going to be ethical at any rate).</a></a>

<p>
He does point out that "Mansions While-U-Wait" can be constructed
in ~1 hour (in space) [where you don't have the heat limitations
that you have on earth].  So my comment regarding "Lorrey's Flying
Mansions" was foresighted, with the only problem being that the
Mansions come "down" instead of going "up".  [Comments regarding
"mis-landing" your mansion remain the same Mike...!]

<p>
So, if you construct nanotech design mansions on Earth, one has
a time of ~6 months.   If you order from MWUW, you get them in
a day or two (but you have to pay more, for shipping, insurance,
etc.)!

<p>
I rest on my earlier claim, that for a few thousand dollars and
a little bit of patience, *everyone* can live like Bill Gates.

<p>
Robert
