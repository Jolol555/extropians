<p>
Size is as important as mass. If the Beckenstein bound is true ( it probably
is but has never been rigorously proven) then the amount of information
inside a sphere of radius R that contains energy E is less than or equal to
2*PI*E*R/(h *ln2), h is really h bar. For meters (R) and kilograms (M) that
works out to  2.577 *10^43* M*R bits.

<p>
A proton has a radius of 10^-15 meters and a mass of 1.67 *10^-27 kilograms,
plug that in and you get 44 bits. You'd do a lot better with a Hydrogen atom.
The mass is almost the same but it's a lot bigger, about 10^-10 meters,
so a hydrogen atom can store 4*10^6 bits.
