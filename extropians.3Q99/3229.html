responsibly, and if you beleive that people are more or less equal, you
should be prepared to trust your fellow man an equal amount. Do you
trust yourself with an atomic warhead? Would you hold a nation hostage
to get what you want? If you trust yourself to not abuse such power you
must trust your fellow man to not abuse such power.</a></a></a></a>

<a name="3239qlink2">Goverment becomes ovebearing over time because those on the left do not
believe in their hearts in this principle, which is the heart of
democratic society. Instead their first principle is "people are no damn
good". This possibly might be because they actually don't trust
themselves to begin with, or else they just see themselves as superior
to everyone else. "I trust myself with a gun, but those damn black
people in the big city are as bad as everyone says," is the type of
attitude you get from this sort of people.</a> 

<p>
Then you have the small  minded types, you know they types that say
things like:

<p>
"Why would anyone ever need more than 640K of RAM?"
"Why would anyone want to eat the apple? Living here in eden is much
more enjoyable."
<br>
"Why would any normal person ever need a gun unless they intended to
commit a crime?"
<br>
"If you are not a member of the Nazi Party, or of the Waffen SS or the
RichsWehr or the Wehrmacht, then you are not a patriotic German, so you
are a traitor, so you have no need of a gun."
A city person thinks "Why would a normal person ever need dynamite
unless they wanted to kill people with a bomb?" Totally ignoring or
ignorant of the fact that the largest consumer of dynamite in the US is
the American farmer....clearing stumps.
<br>
How about: Why would any person want to clone themselves unless they
were racists who wanted to breed a master race and take over the world?
or: Why would anyone want to do genetic engineering on humans unless
they wanted to wipe out the human race with biological weapons?
or: Why would anyone want to upload their minds and become a
super-intelligence unless they wanted to enslave or wipe out humanity?

<p>
<a name="3239qlink3">Such doubts of other human beings says more about YOUR state of mind and
what YOU would do with such power, not about other people. You expect
the worst of other people because you expect such behaviro from
yourself, or you think you are so much better than anyone else. Here's a
tip: grow up.</a>
