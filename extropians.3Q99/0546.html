<i>&gt; not</i><br>
<i>&gt; saying I have a moral objection to this, but why would a significantly</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher intelligence be so interested in our survival except for its own</i><br>
<i>&gt; convenience or curiosity.  Perhaps such an intelligence might discover</i><br>
<i>&gt; that</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is to our own benefit that we should die (those humans are so messy,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and</i><br>
<i>&gt; live only to make their own lives harder...  Some sort of euthenasia)</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0685qlink2">A good point - We treat animals like shit, so why would aliens treat us
well? Because were Humans (centre of the universe, in the image of god
etc...) or is this assumption just yet another human piece of ridiculous
shite? As Stephen Hawking said recently - An alien encounter is likely to be
much closer to "Independence Day" (without the happy ending) than to
"E.T.".....</a>
