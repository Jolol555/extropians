OK, consider it buggered.  {8-]   The long time insiders may not
be aware of the inherent entertainment value of our own list.  My
friends, we are hilarious.  And we dont even know it.  When I
introduced my sister in law to the notion of cryonics she started
laughing.  When I told her most cryonauts freeze only their heads,
she nearly wet her diapers.  We extropians reinforce each other:
we dont even realize how out on the edge we are.

<p>
Of course, I like it out here.  {8^D

<a name="2039qlink1">There are a couple of topics I am more focussed and serious about,
such as the Mars colony.  I dont want to wait for nanotech to do that!
However, when one calculates the numbers, one ends up with
wacky solutions that leave even extropians in stitches, or worse,
with looks of disbelief and disdain.</a>

<p>
<a name="2039qlink2">The 30th anniversary of the moon landing made me realize I
neglected an illustrative example.  Look at the *size* of the lunar
module.  Compare it with the immensity of the Saturn V.  It took one
helllll of a mighty rocket (one which we dont have anymore) to get
that leeeeetle spindly thing to soft land on the moon!</a>  Mars is
<a name="2039qlink3">waaay farther away, (~7 months vs ~3 days) and it takes more
fuel to soft land, since Mars has twice the gravity of the moon.</a>
<a name="2039qlink4">Now look at the size of the Roy Wolford's Biosphere experiment.</a>

<p>
<a name="2039qlink5">So, Rob, once again, I will *very carefully* and sensitively suggest
(hoping not to generate an avalanche of canardic screeds)
that the first Mars colony, if attempted before nanotech, will
be require a single verrrry tiny caloric restricted woman, on a
one-way mission, with one hell of a lot of courage and determination.</a>
<a name="2039qlink6">Wise cracks are allowed, even encouraged, but do insert a grain
of serious thought in reply posts, such as: how much would you
estimate would be the weight of a reasonable minimal habitat for one
person.  Give me that, and I will estimate for you how many shuttle
launches it would take to make that happen.  spike
