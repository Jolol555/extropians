The question above interested me. The way I think is that if there are
multiple copies of yourself, you cease to become the primary self, "the
original one",  you have now  "deintergrated"(my term). All of the copies
are equal to each other and are in essence your selves, it is equally valid
for any of the "copies" to claim to be the original one. But in my opinion,
that's neither true or false. They would have free will and couldn't be
slaves of any overlord since there's not a such thing. I could speculate in
perhaps in the future, it will be possible to create multiple selves
(possibly of different sex and/or races but with common mentality) and sent
them out into the world. Then some time in the future, have a Far Edge
Party, where the selves return and reintergrate into the "primary" self that
existed before the deintergration, who possesses all of the knowledge
accumlated by the selves.
