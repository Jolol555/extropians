Sorry, my mistake, I originally wrote 'is forever' but the sentence got
changed around in the second parse and it became 'is therefore hard to
overcome'.

<p>
<a href="3269.html#3282qlink2">&gt; I believe the relative difficulty in overcoming it is strongly related to</a><br>

it will change my mentality.  I might be the sort of person who will avoid a
tanned hide at all costs in which case my fathers threats would work because
they would change my behaviour (as above), but if I do not have that
mentality my fathers threats would never give me that mentality (or alter my
programming as I think you were suggesting).</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; It has been my direct observation (personal experience) in multiple</i><br>

<p>
Yes, this fits my own thinking as above.<a name="3311qlink5">  I would not be able to reverse my
programming simply because I located the event that caused it, however, if I
find the subconscious memory I am acting upon I can change my behaviour.
