I've also come to the same conclusion, from a completely different
starting point - I observe that in most/many/all cases where there's a
perception of "beauty", it seems to be involved in attracting mates -
poetry (typical lovesick behavior, I hear), music (rock bands and
groupies), even humor (top response on "What do you want in a husband?"
questionaires:  "A sense of humor"), and of course the obvious case of
the "beauty" of a female/male form.  In my opinion, most of the
"mysterious" beauty - the beauty that people claim mere computer
programs will never see; i.e., poetry, music, and humor - is the result
and insignia of sexual selection.

causality is reversed - flowers may be used to woo the fair, but flowers
are (started out as being?) beautiful because they indicate healthy
foraging grounds.  So it's by no means certain.</a></a>
