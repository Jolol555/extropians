<p>
Toward Replacement Parts for the Brain:  Intracranial Implantation of Hardware
Models of Neural Circuitry

<p>
This conference will bring together leading researchers throughout the country
for a focus on one of the newest frontiers of neuroscientific and
bioengineering research: the intracranial implantation of computer chip models
of brain circuitry as neural prosthetics to replace damaged or dysfunctional
brain tissue.  In considering the development<a name="1351qlink1"> of "replacement parts for the
</a>
brain," speakers will address recent advances in (i) biologically realistic
mathematical models of brain or spinal cord function, (ii) silicon- and/or
photonics-based computational devices which incorporate those models, and (iii)
<a name="1351qlink2">"neuron-silicon interface" devices, i.e., micron-scale multi-</a>site electrode
arrays to provide bi-directional communication between the computational
element and functioning neuronal tissue.  The conference is intended to
synergize interdisciplinary research in the neural, engineering, and biomedical
sciences. 

<p>
Session Titles Include:  Neural Prosthetics for Sensory Transduction, Hardware
Implementations of Neural Networks, The Neuron-Silicon Interface, Neuron
Population Dynamics and Information Coding in the Nervous System, Adaptive
Implant Technology and Implant-Based Rehabilitation, and, The "Business" of
Neural Prosthesis and Neural Engineering Technologies.
