<a href="4361.html#4378qlink1">&gt; But why expend so much energy complaining about that, when the vast</a><br>
<i>&gt; majority of feminists worldwide are still strongly focused on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; original goal?  How much of a threat is Andrea Dworkin to you personally?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4383qlink1">I cannot today buy an unedited Penthouse magazine in Canada, and some
cities in the US, specifically because of one woman: Katherine McKinnon,</a>
<a name="4383qlink2">who influenced those legislators much the way Candy Lightner influenced
legislators to crack down on drunk driving.  Mary Kay LeTourneau is in
jail today never having harmed anyone in any way.</a>  Dworkin is harmless
because no one takes her seriously anymore except a few academics who
don't matter, but others like McKinnon carry considerable influence.
They have to, because they want to change laws that have kept them
down in the past.  But when you take on the task of changing law, you
wield a terrible weapon, and you must be prepared to face those who
will fight back.

<p>
I have no quarrel with those who want to change attitudes.  Those who
want to change /laws/ have taken up arms against me, and I will react.
