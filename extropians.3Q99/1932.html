  <li>  In a study which blurs the  borders between the real and the virtual,
scientists have  created an artificial world in a computer, filled it with
``digital bugs'' and raised new questions about evolution. But the study has
triggered a lively scientific debate about  whether virtual reality can ever
be as real as the real thing.

  <li>  There’s a new Melissa-like computer virus that not only attacks Microsoft
software, it taunts the software giant’s leader. The so-called VBS/Monopoly
virus pops up a dialog box that says, “Bill Gates is guilty of monopoly.
Here is the proof. :-)” and then displays a picture of Gates superimposed on
a Monopoly game board. It also sends itself to every e-mail in the victim’s
address book. But anti-virus firms say the virus is not yet spreading widely
around the Internet.

*AN AUSTRALIAN COMPANY is so confident that its new SecurePage software can<br>
thwart attempts to change the content of websites that it is set to
challenge hackers to crack it. Launching the package at the Internet World
Australia exhibition last week, Bahram Boutorabi, chief executive of
Creative Digital Technology of Sydney, said that none of the company's
skilled software developers had yet been able to alter sites that used the
system.
<br>
The "cracking" of Web pages, in which pages are replaced by adulterated
copies designed to embarrass or annoy the host, is an increasing problem. A
number of prominent sites, including those of the US Army and Air Force,
have recently fallen victim to electronic pranksters.
SecurePage works by encrypting a copy of every page on a site. This master
version is continually compared with the pages available on the Internet. If
any of the content changes without authorisation, the software kicks in and
restores the original using the master as the source. Because the master is
encrypted using a triple-strength version of the US government's DES
algorithm, breaking the code would require an inordinate amount of time and
computer power.
<br>
Bruce Schneier of Counterpane Systems, a computer security consultancy in
Minneapolis, says SecurePage sounds like a good idea, but he already sees
where hackers might break in. "They would try to break the page-checking
mechanism," he says. "I don't know how hard it is to do, but if they can
change an equals sign to a 'does not equals' sign, they could break the
system."

*SCOTTISH scientists have made a vital breakthrough in the race to develop<br>
the world's first artificial liver. Now a team from Strathclyde University
and Edinburgh Royal Infirmary has successfully frozen the liver cells of
rats and sheep and then brought them back to life. This could lead to banks
of human frozen liver cells.

*Researchers Believe Light May Be Key to Body Clock<br>
LONDON — Well-timed exposure to light could help solve the problem of jet
lag, according to research published Tuesday.A report in the Journal of the
Royal Society of Medicine said people could minimize jet lag by
understanding how their bodies responded to light at different times of the
day. The report's author Dr James Waterhouse told Reuters: "The most
effective way to avoid jet lag without taking any drugs to induce sleep is
to understand the way light affects the body clock. "It's all about exposure
to and avoidance of bright light at the right times. The method has been
tested successfully on astronauts and night workers. "He said receptors in
the brain regulate the human body clock, which controls when to wake up and
when to go to bed. Travelling to different time zones or doing shift work
can put the clock out of rhythm. Waterhouse said a person's body clock could
be manipulated by exposure to light or by avoiding it. The key time for
fooling the normal body clock is around 5 a.m. he said, so that exposing it
to light before then would delay sleep and exposure after would advance it.
"If you travel to the west you are lucky because the natural light-dark
cycle in the new time zone will help delay the body clock and sleep.
Travelling to the east the body clock and sleep can be advanced by light in
the afternoon and avoidance of it in the morning," he said. Waterhouse
recommended people travelling eastwards to stay indoors before noon or wear
strong sunglasses if they go outside. Scientists believe that it is the
retina at the back of the eye or possibly the skin that senses light and
sends information to the brain.

*GROW YOUR OWN OFFICE TOWER<br>
<br>
If you thought Dolly the sheep was enough playing with genetics for you -
get ready for the next advance in bioengineering: genetic buildings! Believe
it or not, DNA is becoming a practical choice to use as a construction
material. Why?  Well, given the appropriate molecular machinery, it can make
more copies of itself. Plus, a self-replicating "biobrick" can be as strong
as any plastic. Experts say in the future we might be using these new
building materials to speed up the entire manufacturing process, even for
such bulky ordinary objects as houses. Taken to its plausible extreme, it
could be argued we're at the threshold of a new age in construction: we may
soon grow houses right from the root, customized down to the doorsills and
window sizes.

*WORCESTER - With the Massachusetts Biotechnology Research Park as a<br>
backdrop, about 75 people gathered at Plantation and Belmont streets
yesterday afternoon to oppose cloning experiments being done by Advanced
Cell Technology. Advanced Cell Technology is at the forefront of embryonic
stem cell research to develop human cells and tissues through cloning
techniques. The company has stressed that the privately funded work is not
aimed at creating human clones, but at growing human tissues that could be
transplanted into patients. The technique could prevent organ rejection
because the tissue would be grown from cells taken directly from the
patient. Researchers also believe it holds promise for treating diseases
such as Parkinson's, Huntington's, Alzheimer's and diabetes. But protesters
at the rally said the potential benefits do not outweigh the potential
hazards, many of which, they believe, researchers are unable to forecast.
Advanced Cell Technology officials have previously said the human embryos
used in the experiments were not developed beyond 10 to 12 days, and were
considered "pre-embryonic." They were donated by adults who had given
consent for the cells to be used in research. The demonstrators, however,
many of whom belong to anti-abortion groups in Massachusetts and New
Hampshire, don't buy the argument advanced in scientific circles that an
embryo does not become a person until at least after 14 days, when the first
evidence of a nervous system appears. The group plans a second demonstration
at the intersection today and will rally at the Statehouse at the end of
next month.

*The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has had its web page defaced by<br>
someone known as 'Sarin' FERC is a government agency that regulates the
transmission and sale of oil, natural gas, electricity and regulates
hydroelectric projects. The web page defacement called for the replacement
of the administrator of the site.
<br>
Also recently defaced was the U.S. Department of Commerce Institute for
Telecommunication Sciences. This site was defaced by 'Pakistan Hackerz Club'
the page they left behind claimed to own America and threatend additional
nuclear tests unless Pakistan's internal affairs are not messed with.
