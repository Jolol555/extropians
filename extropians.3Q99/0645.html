Such as when one thinks in terms of time constants.  In an RC circuit
for instance, one time constant is the time when 1/e of the voltage remains
accross the resistor.  Rocket guys often think in terms of e as well, since
there is "one e-th" as much mass as you started with when your rocket
achieves the velocity of its exhaust.

...Which we do when we work in radians.  Make a right turn, thats
half pi radians.  You think in pi when you do angles.

Great post Mike.  I am more convinced than ever that we humans
have *discovered* math, not *invented* it.  Lifeforms everywhere will
have the same ~90 some elements to discover, even if theirs are
in different proportions than ours, and that the great mathematical
truths will be discovered by all exocivilizations, should they exist.  spike
