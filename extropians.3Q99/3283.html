The differences would then be ~50 years from classical to quatum computers
and 20 years from current software to AI.  The point I was trying to make
with my analogy is the conceptual difference.  Most people are of the
opinion that when computers have more processing power than brains we will
then be able to program an AI with ease.  Our current understanding of
complex systems is much less than that of quantum computing, but the
implementation of quantum computing is much harder, hence the analogy.  So
in essence I'm saying first transhuman AI ~2050 CRNS.

<p>
It's a nice idea but I think there are larger conceptual challenges to be
met before this becomes a programming project.  These challenges (mostly
mathematical, such as how complex systems scale) aren't likely to get solved
by open-source hackers or even AI-researchers.  IMHO, this isn't something
you can program using conventional techniques.  Feel free to prove me wrong.
