What would be interesting is to move the (thoroughly debugged;
RAID-capable; journalling) file system into the periperal storage 
unit itself. It can be based on some simple embedded OS, even no need
to go multitasking -- to maximize simplicity. Perhaps even move most
of it into hardware?

<p>
I think the chiefest reason against just putting objects into
nonvolatile virtual memory vs. using file systems currently 
is instability. Horrible to lose a large database to a simple
system crash. Of course with checkpointing (periodic total 
system state snapshots) and extremely stable software this 
might become less an issue.

<p>
It would be interesting to speculate if a simplified Linux could ever
grow stable enough for this.
