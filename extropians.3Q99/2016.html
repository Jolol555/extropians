What about an organization that is partly funded by subsidies,
like the BSA?  With, say, 5% of the population being gay and
30% of the income of the BSA coming from subsidies, that would
make gay people 1.5% owner of the BSA -- something to think about.

Your above statement about libertarianism sounds a bit like
the leftish dribble we all hear to often. Nice in principle
but totally unrealistic and with very serious consequences.

<a name="2023qlink1">Btw, here (the Netherlands) the scouts organization has the
promotion of tolerance pretty high on it's agenda. Being a
scouts leader myself I even try to make it clear to the kids
that tolerance of intolerance is also part of the picture,
but that's too difficult to grasp for most 11 year-olds :)
