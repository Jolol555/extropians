Hey, great minds think alike- or maybe it's just monkey mischief.
Anyway, I didn't make it to Extro for several reasons,
underemployment, contract work to catch up on (I've been
procrastinating), tight budget, and limited interest.  I might try
to make to Foresight's next meeting, if the price is right... but I
also want to make it to next year's Mars Society meeting, Space
Frontier Foundation next month, Space Access in April... ya might
see a trend here.
