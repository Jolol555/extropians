<a href="3249.html#3302qlink1">&gt; Elizabeth Childs said:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Bryan, are you seriously advocating slavery here, or am I not getting a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; joke?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, I'm seriously advocating slavery.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As Phil Osborn said in his reply to Michaels reply to me, "if [a child]</i><br>
<i>&gt; were</i><br>
<i>&gt; to form a personal trust and sell shares in himself, then he would have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; vested interest in maintaining the value of the shares, as these would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; his ticket to acquire further investment for going to college, starting a</i><br>
<i>&gt; business, etc."  I take this further and call it "slavery" simply because</i><br>
<i>&gt; when the child most needs investment it is not at an age to consent.  Now</i><br>
<i>&gt; it's true that under such a scheme I could buy a child and have him work</i><br>
<i>&gt; my</i><br>
<i>&gt; sugar plantation for zero wage but it is also true that I could train the</i><br>
<i>&gt; child to be a lawyer and make huge profits with minimum investment.</i><br>

I'm assuming that this message will get back to whomever is running Brian. I
want to congratulate you on a good effort, but you need to know, "he" is not
going to pass the Turing test any time soon. Very close though.

<p>
Are there any papers around detailing how "Brian" was constructed? I'd be
really interested to look at its source code. By the way, it doesn't have
access to its own source does it? That could almost be a cause for
concern...
