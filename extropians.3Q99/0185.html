[Inspired by a message about "Transact- optic fiber network throughout
Canberra"]

<p>
In Palo Alto, California, we have an active group of telecommunication
activists who have persuaded the city to do a trial of Fiber-to-the-Home
(FTTH), which we believe is worth doing now rather than doing something
"half fast" that has to be replaced in a few years.

<p>
Right now we have a multi-city cable television system that is
cooperatively owned by its viewers.  It hasn't been financially
successful enough to meet its upcoming debt repayment, and is in
negotiations with AT&amp;T Broadband (formerly mostly TCI cable company)
about being bought out.

<p>
The special thing is that we activists are looking for companies that
would be interested in leasing channel/bandwidth space on a general
telecomm system that could be an alternative to an AT&amp;T monopoly.  We
believe that an "open access" system, with different technologies and
different content (TV shows, IP telephony, videoconferencing, education
on demand, etc.) can produce greater economic and political freedom than
a monopoly owned system.  This issue is exciting right now because of a
court decision in Portland, Oregon, saying that cities can require open
access. There have also been principled resignations in Los Angeles,
outcry in San Francisco, and lots of "buzz" among telecommunication
policy students.

<p>
We see our Cable Co-op situation as a natural testbed for open access. 
If the dollars add up well, we viewer-owners could choose to reject the
AT&amp;T monopoly and use the prospect of lease revenues to justify private
financing for an independent information utility that encourages
competition rather than monopoly control.

<p>
We believe that ISP's, new cable channels, long distance telephone
carriers, and a lot of new technologies would be the natural customers
for general bandwidth to the homes. The Palo Alto cable system is
currently coaxial cable, with cable modems available.  It's easy to
envision fiber optic cables being extended to neighborhood nodes and
eventually all the way to the homes.  The city of Palo Alto also has a
large backbone of unused ("dark") optic fiber strands that could be
incorporated in a system.   And the existing optical fiber is connected
to the Palo Alto Information Exchange (PAIX), a major exchange point of
the Internet.

<p>
If anyone knows companies that would be interested in leasing bandwidth,
please get in touch with me at dharris@best.com or via phones at
650-494-7696 or 650-856-9126 (voicemail).  Direct e-mail or calls are
best, as I can't keep up  with postings on all the mailing lists where
you might see this.

<p>
Toward faster exchange of all sorts of information,


<UL>

<i>&gt; only a test, just 200 homes....</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; consumer cost at $520 not counting the CO equipment and thats going</i><br>

<i>&gt; 12) very big bucks, and thats just for 12 ports......</i><br>

<i>&gt; We had planned to bring fiber to the door about 8 years ago, then</i><br>
