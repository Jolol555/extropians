tools used by nonsense-peddlers:</a></a>

</a>

<p>
<a name="0921qlink3"><a name="0717qlink3">"Consistent with" is a great weasel phrase.  All the "wealth of evidence"
(by which he means 3 pictures) is also "consistent with" the fact that
it's just a bleeping rock.  Suggesting that there is a controversy when
there really isn't one also helps; there's only a controversy because
a few hard-headed idiots won't face the facts.</a></a>

mind that such will be favorable to the speaker's point of view, even if
that's very unlikely.  Also note the overuse of technical-sounding words
like "morphology" where "shape" would be simpler and more direct.  This
also makes a speaker sound more educated to the masses.</a></a>

Nothing like a paid-for PhD to make people take you seriously.</a></a>
Most serious scientists don't bother with titles; when was the
last time you saw "Dr. Einstein" or "Dr. Feinmann"?  (He even
titled his own book "Surely You're Joking, /Mr./ Feinmann.")
They've /earned/ their credibility, so they have no need to
remind anyone that they jumped through some university hoops.
