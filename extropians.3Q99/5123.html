Hello everyone,

<p>
If cryonics interest you at all then read these posts, especially those by 
Mike Darwin.  His posts make for very interesting reading.  It appears 21st 
Century Medicine has made very important leaps forward in the methods used 
for cryonic suspension.  I have reproduced here posts from the Cryonet 
showing the comments and queries of Robert Ettinger, myself and Thomas 
Donaldson.

<p>
Mike Darwin later responds with very detailed posts explaining not only 
about the technical advances but also on where credit should be given for 
these breakthroughs.  This is a very exciting time for cryonics even though 
much still needs to be done in relation to both research and application.  
Mike Darwin is without doubt a brilliant and extremely dedicated individual 
who though blunt says it how he sees it.

<p>
sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg

Subject: 21CM patent

<p>
Go to www.uspto.gov to access the full text of the patent (Sep.14) assigned
to 21st Century Medicine Inc. Oddly enough, the inventors listed do not
include Greg Fahy; they are Brian G. Wowk, Michael G. Federowicz ["Darwin"],
Sandra R. Russell, and Steven B. Harris. It runs about 18 printed pages.

<p>
Naturally, we will investigate the procedures and substances mentioned.

<p>
There are many interesting features in the patent, not least the structure 
of
<br>
claims. The claims start broadly, including any alkoxylated organic compound
in a concentration sufficient to permit vitrification and cooling until
vitrified; and the application of this to any organ, tissue, or animal. More
specific claims relate to use of 2-methoxyethanol and
3-methoxy-1,2-propanediol.

<p>
The inventors acknowledge that glycol ethers have been used before to
preserve embryos and cell suspensions, but believe they have priority in
application to tissues, organs, and animals. Obviously, there are 
potentially
<br>
interesting questions in patent law--both as to the relation between these
inventors and prior users of glycol ethers, and between these inventors and
later users of new variations and applications.

<p>
"Summary" of the invention mentions perfusing an inert fluid through the
vascular system and controlling the temperature of the fluid; and a class of
new glycol ether CPAs. Oddly enough, the Claims do not (to my legally
untutored mind) appear to make any direct or specific reference to cooling
methods, even though in the "Summary" that seems important.

<p>
"Glycol ethers" are understood to include compounds containing alkoxy--and
particularly methoxy--functional groups. Included are alkoxylated alkanes 
and
<br>
alkoxylated alcohols and polyols, with several sub-groups given.

<p>
For some organs, cooling and rewarming rates can exceed 100 degC per minute.
[This seems to suggest possible use with other CPAs, such as amides.]

<p>
"Large animals can be perfused wit high concentrations of  glycol ethers 
near
<br>
0 C with rapid equilibration, no dehydration, no edema or other visible
evidence of toxic effects. Histologic preservation is excellent at
microscopic and ultrasturctural levels."

<p>
References include Skrecky's proposal in Cryonet #5174, 1995; CRYONICS:
REACHING FOR TOMORROW (Wowk &amp; Darwin, 1991; and THE PROSPECT OF IMMORTALITY,
1964; and a Darwin/Hixon piece in CRYONICS July 1984, as well as various
patents and publications in recognized journals.

<p>
I have not found any patent entries under "ice blockers," although the
instant patent says that suppression of ice formation is an important
feature. I believe 21CM has a different class of substances it calls ice
blockers, acting through a different mechanism.

<p>
The "Conclusion" mentions unprecedentedly high rates of cooling and
rewarming,;and the advantages of the new CPAs, including penetration and low
viscosity, rapid equilibration, ice inhibition, minimization of toxicity, 
and
<br>
glass forming properties.

<p>
Congratulations to all the inventors involved. Lots of work ahead.

Hello everyone,

<p>
I looked over the patent for 21st Century Medicine's research developments
and must say I am VERY IMPRESSED!!!  I congratulate those who made it
possible!!

<p>
The cooling rates shown in Table III are more than ten times greater than
can be achieved by previous external cooling methods.
Such rapid cooling will allow significant decreases in the concentration of
cryoprotectants needed to vitrify, enhancing the prospects
for successful cryopreservation of organs with non-toxic CPA mixtures. These
cooling rates also for the first time open the possibility
of vitrifying whole humans.

<p>
(Later at the conclusion)
<br>
CONCLUSION

<p>
The method of the present invention allows cooling and subsequent rewarming
from temperatures lower than -100.degree. C. at
rates exceeding 100.degree. C. per minute for some organs. These rates are
much higher than can be achieved by external heat
transfer methods, and will allow significant reduction of the concentration
of cryoprotective agents needed to achieve reversible
vitrification of organs for long-term banking. Heat transfer by inert fluid
perfusion is also beneficial for reducing ice crystal damage
and cryoprotectant toxicity during ordinary freezing and thawing.

<p>
The present invention also provides a class of new cryoprotective agent
(glycol ethers) for reduction and prevention of ice formation
during cooling of vascular tissues and organs. Glycol ethers generally, and
methoxylated compounds in particular, are highly
penetrating agents that equilibrate rapidly upon perfusion, and exhibit
strong ice inhibition and glass forming properties. The low
viscosity and freezing point of these compounds also make them well-suited
for sub-zero perfusion to minimize toxic effects.
Toxicities are compatible with the potential use of glycol ethers in
perfusate solutions for reversible cryopreservation of organs and
large organisms by freezing or vitrification.

<p>
(End of patent document reproduction)

<p>
That cooling rates using these techniques are TEN times faster then in the
past is incredible.  And that glycol ethers are far superior penetrating
agents compared to what was used in the past is a major step forward.

<p>
"These cooling rates also for the first time open the possibility
of vitrifying whole humans" is a statement in the patent document that made
me wonder when will these new methods in their entirety be used to TRULY
vitrify a human??

<p>
And with such a combination of major advances what still needs to be done??
How could things still be improved?  What are the possibilities down the
road?  What is next for 21st Century Medicine? And how is the Prometheus
Project doing?

<p>
I hope the major cryonics providers will all adopt these methods for their
clients.  Is 21st Century Medicine working with the various organizations to
bring them up to speed?  Just how expensive will it be to offer these
techniques??

<p>
I remember reading in the Cryocare archives a paper by Mike Darwin where he
admitted the major damage suspension did on the cellular level and how so
much still had to be done.  Reading his paper took away much of my early
hope in cryonics and a desire that breakthroughs would be made.

<p>
But having read through the patent I feel new hope!! Again my
congratulations and thanks to all those who made it possible!!  I want to
hug you all!!

<p>
I look forward to hearing from you all regarding this patent and my views
and questions about it.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Hi everyone!

<p>
I too look forward to wider application of the cryoprotectants and
perfusion technology created by 21st Century Medicine. Yes, it may not be
immediate; the first thing to do is to try these methods on brains.
(There was a time lapse between the first Wright brothers flight and
the use of 747's, after all).

<p>
There is also some question in my own mind about whether or not some of
the perfusion methods described will prove to be patentable ... but even
the cryoprotectants alone make a big advance.

<p>
As for congratulations, it seems to me that the most congratulations are
due to Saul Kent and Bill Faloon, who funded 21st Century Medicine in the
first place. Yes, such advances do require redoubtable technical and
scientific knowledge, too, but they could not have occurred without
funding ... and in my own personal estimation, they might have occurred
as long as 10 years ago, if only the funding had then existed.

<pre>
                        Best and long long life to all,

Subject: I was using two standards, one for knowledge and another for action
Date: Tue, 28 Sep 1999 23:42:03 +1000 (EST)

<p>
Hi Mike!

<p>
Perhaps I put the matter too strongly. I've frequently found, however,
that things which first look simple turn out to be much harder than we
think, and it was general thoughts of this kind which made me comment that
working out how to vitrify brains may take longer than expected.

<p>
<a name="5229qlink1">In terms of the problem we're setting ourselves, we want to know that we
can vitrify the brains of primates (ideally chimpanzees, the closest to
us, though that starts to become morally questionable... and there are
plenty of other primates not so bright). Without actually doing that, we
don't KNOW that a treatment we've applied to a quite different animal
will still work. Yes, it's very likely, but not certain. And if it DID
turn out not to work so easily, we'd have to do extra experiments to fix
that problem.
</a>

<p>
So maybe I'm just setting higher standards for certainty.

<p>
I will point out, though, that if I find that I am dying (or those who are
caring for me find that) then I'd want to be suspended by a method which
is the best available within my budget. What you say increases my
conviction that vitrification with one of the solutions 21st Century
Medicine has found is likely to be best available, NOW. I'm using two
different standards here: the evidence needed to assure me that something
is true, and the evidence needed to tell me that something is likely.

<p>
In any case, it's still good work and deserves praise, and even some
money.

<pre>
                        Best and long long life,

                                Thomas Donaldson
