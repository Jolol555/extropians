*July 2 — Hackers have targeted Network Solutions Inc. — the keeper of<br>
Internet address suffixes such as .com and .org - redirecting its traffic to
some of the companies that will soon compete.

*Stem cells grown outside the body<br>
<br>
July 6 — An extra hormone can help elusive blood stem cells multiply and
thrive outside the body, offering cancer patients and others a ready supply
of the life-giving cells, scientists said Tuesday.

*Study Looks To Nuclear Energy As Micro-Scale Fuel<br>

*TOKYO (July 5, 1999 12:06 p.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) - The world's<br>
first clones of an adult cow turned 1 year old on Monday, and Japanese
officials said they are growing strong and healthy.
The twins, named Noto and Kaga, were the second adult-animal clones after
Dolly, the British sheep that made history by becoming the first clone of an
adult animal.
<br>
Despite being slightly smaller than most cows their age, Noto and Kaga are
quite healthy, said Tatsuhiko Matsuda, an official of the Ishikawa
Prefectural Livestock Research Center, 190 miles northwest of Tokyo.
"They are full of energy, they have had no unusual illnesses and they are
growing vigorously," he said.
<br>
The pair was born about 40 days prematurely and at 440 pounds now, they are
still slightly below average size, he said.
The cows should soon reach sexual maturity and the next step for the
researchers is to determine if they are capable of giving birth, Matsuda
said. If all is normal, the cows will be artificially inseminated in an
attempt to produce a second generation of cloned animals.
Noto and Kaga were born after researchers took cells from an adult cow and
placed them in unfertilized eggs whose own nuclei had been removed. The
artificially cultivated embryos were then placed into the wombs of cows.
Their births were significant primarily because they showed that other
animals, not just sheep, could be cloned.
Cloning an adult, rather than a fetus, means scientists could reproduce
animals with chosen characteristics. For example, adult cows that produce
more milk could be targeted for cloning.
Scientists have cloned several kinds of animals since Dolly's arrival three
years ago.
<br>
In April, geneticists at Tufts University in Massachusetts cloned three
goats.

*Earth may have 'twin' in space<br>
<br>
Somewhere out there in deep space, Earth may have a lost ''twin'' capable of
supporting life, an astronomer says. In a theory outlined in the July 1
issue of the journal Nature, David Stevenson of the California Institute of
Technology says Earth may have had one or more siblings when the solar
system was born, but they were jettisoned by gravity when they got too close
to Jupiter or other large planets. The idea has been around for a while. But
Stevenson goes a step further, drawing on planetary theory and his own
calculations to argue that these Earth-like planets may be capable of
supporting life, despite their wanderings through the cold, dark void, far
from the sun. ''Life would have to be simple,'' he said. ''Certainly you
wouldn't have much of it.'' Stevenson said these so-called rogue planets may
be heated by a dense hydrogen atmosphere and volcanoes, instead of sunlight.

*Neuroscience has been described as the last great frontier of human<br>
biology - in fact NASA's most recent mission, Neurolab, was devoted to
investigations involving the nervous system. Australian neuroscientists are
among the leaders in brain research.
