I haven't run across anyone mentioning this, so I thought
I would comment on it.

<p>
The Saga of the Cuckoo, by Frederik Pohl &amp; Jack Williamson
consists of two parts: "Farthest Star" (1975) and
"Wall Around A Star" (1983).

<p>
The style of the book doesn't make it something to write
home about -- it seems like it was adapted from a set of
shorter stories.  The content however is very interesting
to many of us because of the subjects, which include:

<UL>
  <li>  The Cuckoo -- a 1 AU sphere with a very low density
   approaching the galaxy from points unknown whose
   "creator" is "asleep".
  <li>  The primary transportation method - tachyon replicators
   [Step into one, get scanned and out pops a duplicate
   of you many light years away.]
  <li>  The concept of aliens "operating" "purchased people".
  <li>  The priority differences between races that operate as
   "individuals" and races that operate as "collectives".
  <li>  The sociology of interactions between races of many kinds.


</UL>
<p>
Probably none of this is new to old SF hands.  I thought
it was both educational and entertaining from the perspectives
we have regarding M-Brains, uploading, personal identity,
self-editing, limits to intelligence, etc.  I recomend it to
people who want to expand their collection of ideas on these
subjects.

<p>
The best part from my perspective were the internal self-conflicts
that arose when you were "beaming" yourself into situations that
were potentially dangerous ("... What risk? Its the *other* me that
might get killed..."; "... Sure, why not, I've only been killed 7
times already...").  The complications of copies of copies with
different time lines (some of whom were involved in romantic
liasons &amp; forced separations) point out how complicated this
can get.

<p>
Powells (www.powells.com) has a couple of used copies for sale.
