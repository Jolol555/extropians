<a name="1999qlink1"><a name="1984qlink1">I would be very interested in having access to "our own"
distributed network. I could see using it for possibly
rendering scenes from Extropian/&gt;H art projects. Of course
</a>
besides building the system itself (there have got to be some
open source projects going on by now for this), we would
need some way of determining what gets run on it (or pieces
of it) at any given time if it is going to be multi-use.
It would be appealing to me to have some kind of marketbased
 pricing mechanism whereby someone who really needed
it could pay to preempt whatever we all decide to normally run
on it "for free". If it actually worked, it might lead eventually
to the development of a large net-wide market for CPU time.
