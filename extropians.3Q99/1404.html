<a href="1401.html#1404qlink1">&gt; &gt; ~I missed Extro 3, can you elaborate on this Minsky characterization?</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I was there and found it fairly "interesting".  Someone in the audience,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I believe asked Marvin what he considered to be a stupid question</i><br>
<i>&gt; (somebody correct me if this is wrong).  Marvin's response was, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe, in essence, "That's a stupid question, could you sit</i><br>
<i>&gt; down so we could move onto the next question".  The person refused</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then things got very loud.</i><br>

<p>
My recollection was that Michael Butler was taking a long time,
and Minsky asked him to move on because there was a line behind him
of people wanting to ask what would probably be more interesting
questions; Mr. Butler continued, and there was some minor heated
exchange.  Mr. Butler later apologized.  I had lunch with Minski
and others that day; he was friendly and entertaining.
