From: "Robert J. Bradbury" &lt;bradbury@www.aeiveos.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="2630.html#2633qlink1">&gt;This goes back to some degree to the "nutriceuticals"</a><br>
<i>&gt;that I had to run through at the Extro4 conference.</i><br>

<p>
I hated missing Extro-4


<p>
<a href="2630.html#2633qlink2">&gt;People will find engineered crops *much* more acceptable</a><br>
<i>&gt;if you tell them they are *better* for *them* instead</i><br>
<i>&gt;of being *better* for the farmers (with insect resistance).</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2640qlink1">I couldn't agree more. I'm not interested in biotech crops whose
purpose is to be able to successfully douse the fields with
"Roundup", in fact I oppose such bioengineering.</a> I have a hunch
this will backfire anyway as plasmid transfer renders the weeds
immune as well.

<p>
<a name="2640qlink2">I'll take a Brandywine tomato over a "flavrsavr" anyday...</a>

<p>
The heirloom gardening folks and new seed companies like "seeds of
change" are the ones on the right track.


<p>
<a href="2630.html#2633qlink3">&gt;I'll be interested to see what happens if they engineer</a><br>
<i>&gt;say something like cabbage to take out the toxins</i><br>
<i>&gt;that are "theoretically" carcinogenic.  Then you</i><br>
<i>&gt;market the engineered cabbage as *less* toxic than</i><br>
<i>&gt;natural cabbage (with data from some scientific</i><br>
<i>&gt;studies proving it to be the case).  I'll lay odds</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the "naturalists" will still be unimpressed.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2640qlink3">I suspect such crops would do poorly in the field, you can make a
good case that we have evolved (except in Kansas) the abilty to
deal with these "natural" toxins.</a>

<p>
<a href="2630.html#2633qlink4">&gt;All of the crops I've seen so far have either been</a><br>
<i>&gt;for the benefit of the farmer (Bt-enhanced crops),</i><br>
<i>&gt;the consumer's pocketbook (i.e. the Calgene</i><br>
<i>&gt;tomato &amp; indirectly the Bt-enhanced crops) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;perhaps the seed producer (by engineering</i><br>
<i>&gt;in ways to make the crop sterile, so you have</i><br>
<i>&gt;to by more seed from the seed producer).</i><br>

<p>
Seeds of change won't sell a seed that won't naturally pollinate.

<p>
<a href="2630.html#2633qlink5">&gt;It is interesting that if public labs get into</a><br>
<i>&gt;the business of producing engineered enhancements</i><br>
<i>&gt;in non-sterile seeds, then industry would be forced</i><br>
<i>&gt;to follow suit.  For many years industry didn't want</i><br>
<i>&gt;to do genetically engineered crops because they</i><br>
<i>&gt;couldn't figure out how to make them sterile.</i><br>
<i>&gt;It interesting that this is a case where government</i><br>
<i>&gt;"competition" could force technology development</i><br>
<i>&gt;in industry.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2640qlink4">I don't know how much lab work we really need. New companies like
SOC not only save and reproduce heirloom seeds, but breed new
varieties. Millions of backyard experimenters sound's like a better
way to go.....</a>


<p>
Actually the micronutrient rice is only a halfway step in my
opinion. We need to get over the Judeo-Christian belief that
everything we need has been put here for us by a supreme being, and
get people on good vitamin/mineral/antioxident protocols. You'd
have to eat oranges all day to get the 6 grams of vitamin C I get
in 6 tablets.....

<p>
I just had a complete physical and all my readings were textbook
perfect.... cholesterol at 172 and I'm 290lbs.
