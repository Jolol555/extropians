<a href="3442.html#3470qlink1">&gt;&gt; Yeeeaaaah. Neural Darwinism - screw the scraggliers, who needs them? Now I</a><br>
just
<br>
<a href="3442.html#3470qlink2">&gt;&gt; need to justify chain-smoking and I'm home free.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;You could always point to the attention-improving effects of nicotine,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but I guess explaining away lung cancer and artheriosclerosis are a</i><br>
<i>&gt;bit harder.</i><br>

<p>
As I see it, smoking a pack a day is my way of giving back to the community.
Just think about the Social Security savings if die around 65, after I'm done
being productive and
<br>
before I've collected significant benefits. I encourage all socially conscious
extropians to consider doing the same. Don't worry about medical expenses
either - It's a fair cop, call Kevorkian and I'll go quietly.

<p>
(With any luck though my lungs will hold out till nanotechnology, and then I can
get a nice fresh pair. And while I'm thinking about it, when *exactly* is the
singularity going to occur? I want to to get a jump on dinner reservations.)

<p>
<a href="3442.html#3470qlink3">&gt;As for myself, I now have a big pile of articles to justify my</a><br>
<i>&gt;caffeine consumption. :-)</i><br>

<p>
This is another reason to take up smoking - you no longer have to worry about
most of your other bad habits. Why deal with the tenth decimal place when the
first one's going to get you?

<p>
Eg: "Hey Matt - aren't you worried that cell phone's going to give you a brain
tumor?"
<p>
       "Nope. I've got lung cancer."
