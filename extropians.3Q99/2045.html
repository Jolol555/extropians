Abstract
<br>
  To verify the influence of food consistency on satiety mechanisms we
  evaluated the effects of the same meal in solid-liquid (SM)
  and homogenized (HM) form on satiety sensation, gastric emptying rate and
  plasma cholecystokinin (CCK) concentration. Eight healthy men, aged 21-28
  (mean 24.5) years were given two meals (cooked vegetables
  250 g, cheese 35 g, croutons 50 g and olive oil 25 g, total energy 2573 kJ,
  with water 300 ml) differing only in physical
  state: SM and HM. The subjects consumed the
  meals in randomized order on non-consecutive days. The
  sensations of fullness, satiety and desire to eat were evaluated by means</a> of
  a questionnaire, gastric emptying was assessed by ultrasonographic
  measurement of antral area, and plasma CCK concentration was measured by
  radioimmunoassay. The vegetable-rich meal was significantly
  more satiating (P &lt; 0.05) when in the HM form than when eaten in a SM
  state. Furthermore, the overall gastric emptying time was
  significantly slowed (255 (SEM 11) min after HM v. 214 (SEM 12) min after SM;
  P &lt; 0.05) and CCK peak occurred later (94 (SEM 12) min after HM v. 62 (SEM

<OL>
  <li>  min after SM; NS) when the food was consumed in the HM form.
  Independently of the type of meal, antral area was
  significantly related to fullness sensations (r2 0.46, P = 0.004). These
  results demonstrate that meal consistency is an important
  physical food characteristic which influences both gastric
  emptying rate and satiety sensation. Moreover, the relationship observed
  between antral area and fullness sensation confirms that antral distension
  plays a part in the regulation of eating behaviour.
