It won't. There is no point in building massive structures from
reactive moieties atom-by-deposited-atom (unless one is a
perfectionist nano-aesthete wanting to live in a perfect-crystal
diamond mansion the size of the Ritz). We can rather mine
carbonates/soil carbon/air carbon dioxide, turn them into few-atom
polymerizable precursors a la simulated photosynthesis and cobble them
together quickly a la tightly controlled polymerization/convergent
(auto) assembly. Sapphire is a very very exclusive substrate indeed.

<p>
Working with silicates deposited from aqueous solutions could also be
worthwhile.

<p>
This also illustrates very well why monkeys are not going to make it.
Too space/time/energy inefficient. Also, too dumb/slow to protect
themselves.
