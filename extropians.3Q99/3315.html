And yet, we aren't fitness-maximizers, but adaptation-executors, to
paraphrase Cosmides and Tooby (from _The Adaptive Mind_ - thanks, Paul
Hughes!).  We are the sum of our adaptations, and are under no
obligation to maximize our fitness.  Thus the contraceptive, for example.

<p>
We are the sum of our adaptations, and one of those adaptations stands
out from all the others - it's the adaptation of reasoning, of
representing the logic and contents of the Universe, of believing what's
true.  In the end this is the only meaningful adaptation; all the others
being but shadows of the ancestral environment, causes without goals,
mere programs that can become obsolete in an instant with a change of context.

<p>
To believe what is true is also the only meaningful adaptation in a
greater sense, because, when combined with the adaptation - not
fitness-maximizing behavior, but *adaptation* - that allows us to direct
<pre>
our actions through purposes, formulate subgoals based on cognitive
content rather than instinct, it yields the impulse to *do what is
right*.  And despite failure, and misguided actions, and all the other
</pre>
obstacles, sometimes that impulse *does* cause something right to come about.

<p>
Thus the pattern that is a human - though evolved by a causal process
with no concern for truth or right - may come to reflect the logic of
the Universe, and perhaps even to serve the unknown ultimate ends of
existence; if, of course, any exist.
