Generalization Spike.  Did the society stagnate or just the
segment of it that historians write about?  I would say more
societies ended by natural disasters or conquest than by
stagnation.

  But *in some areas* of our lives, our

<p>
Sure.  Personal transport that is [relatively] inexpensive due
to economies of scale has put us in a position that is difficult
to move.  However developments like (a) the aircar; (b)
the newer people mover systems [from Rathyeon?]; and (c) aircars
make it clear that there are paths away from this local optima.

I don't think for a minute this is what people desire.
Show them a working aicrcar that they can use and I suspect
they would dump the $$$) 10K-100K into byying one.
