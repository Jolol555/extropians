Perhaps the brain could be forced to grow as a solid lump of matter without
the usual structure.  Or perhaps, and here comes an ethical debate, the
brain could be removed from a healthy child before it has a chance to fully
develop.  In a recent discussion about abortion with friends I suggested
that abortion be allowed until about 21 to 27 months after conception.  As
usual they changed the subject and hoped to God I was joking.  My reasoning
behind this is simple: the argument behind pro-choice is that the early
foetus is not an individual, but individuality probably doesn't develop
until at least a year to eighteen months into the childs life.  Despite
this, most people who are for abortion are against murdering babies.  An
immediate counter argument would be to point out my use of the word
"probably" - it's true, we don't know when the 'self' develops exactly, but
I think it would be reasonable in principle to terminate 'pregnancy' until
at least six months after birth.  In practice allowing mothers to abort
children after birth would probably not be the best idea, however, what of
foetuses and children grown in labs?  If the individual was restricted from
development (without input could the 'self' develop?) we should in principle
then be allowed to perform any experiment that we do on animals now.  My own
personal interest in the anencephalic bodies was not for spare parts but for
'hacks' to devalue meat in the minds of the public.  What matters to me is
mind.  Actually, what matters to me is value, monetary value in the current
situation, perhaps a more elaborate scheme in the future.  And that's where
the next suggestion, the one that makes people leave the room, comes in.
Allow abortion until the child is financial self-supporting.  Obviously I
wouldn't suggest such a thing in the current social agenda, we live in a
world that doesn't value (and I mean in the sense of monetary value) human
life, education, individual welfare, health care, justice, et cetera.  But
my own political agenda can justify, say, human experimentation on an
individiual because of his or her inability to support him- or herself and
can justify it to a greater degree than the current system can justify not
doing it.  I believe this is the first time I've mentioned my own political,
ethical, and moral opinions on this list.  I've avoided discussing them in
the past, I hope you can appreciate why.
