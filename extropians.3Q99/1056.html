The big trick here that eludes everyone is that you _don't_ "decide" 
beforehand what is artificial and what's not.  You go there and find out, 
which can't be done until enough good researchers are free to meaningfully 
discuss the issue without being ridiculed.  Why Mars, as opposed to, say, the 
hexagonal formation on top of Saturn?  Because it's a hell of a lot closer, 
for one thing, and we _already_ have the hardware in place to take all the 
photos we want--which isn't being done.  And this isn't limited to the 
Surveyor, by any means: we plan on sending a mission every two years, 
culminating in a manned mission c. 2015.  So we have the means.  Technology 
isn't the impediment; psychology is.
