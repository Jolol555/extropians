Silly Conjecture, by a silly conjecturist: There ain't no Great Filter.  What 
appears to be Fermi's paradox is simply that outer space is kinda big; and 
that real space-faring Super-Civilizations/Personalities/Brains are very, 
very, Spread Out.  That radio waves just don't propagate quite as well as we 
think they should, and that where we are physically at-from the supposed 
other chaps- is something massive that jams radio signals and interupts 
neutrino streams. A galactic nucleus would do; and just maybe we are the only 
sentients in the dear, old, Milky Way?
