<a href="1987.html#1992qlink1">&gt; &gt;Here in Stockholm we only got a 70% eclipse, but the weather was a</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;beautiful summer day, so I spent the eclipse hour outside with a small</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;telescope, using it to image the sun on a piece of cardboard. Most of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the neighbourhood children appeared to watch, and I got the chance to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;explain a bit of optics and astronomy for them. A small thing, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;becoming the trusted neighborhood scientist is a good way of spreading</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the memes and combatting silliness like Paco Rabanne's predictions.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If I remember well he had made the promise to close his mouth forever if his</i><br>
<i>&gt; last prediction is wrong ;)</i><br>

<p>
His problem isn't that he is a religious figure, which means his
failed prediction will be held against him (had he been a guru his
credibility would have remained roughly constant :-). 

<p>
<a href="1987.html#1992qlink2">&gt; Still, I found "interesting" that the guy was efficiently managing to spread</a><br>
<i>&gt; his stupidity outside the french side of the world.. Is it possible for him</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have so much influence in Sweden?</i><br>

<p>
No, none other than somebody mentioning him in one of those "craziness
around the world" notices somewhere in a newspaper. I'm taking the
proactive stance - immunize the children first to bad memes and tell
them about critical thinking, rather than trying to stamp out already
present idiocy.

<p>
<a href="1987.html#1992qlink3">&gt; I will repeat myself 16 times today that the world is far more</a><br>
<i>&gt; interconnected than I was thinking previously ;)...</i><br>

<p>
My US trip also brought it home to me clearly - suddenly I felt that
being abroad wasn't that much different from being at home (except for
small changes in culture etc). Very strange feeling, and rather nice.
