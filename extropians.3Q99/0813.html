<p>
Yup.  {8-[  On the bright side, however, the money I saved on birth
control devices alone was sufficient to finance a state-of-the-art
desktop computer.  {8^D

Another idea:  Consider the Jewish people.  Here is a group that have
certainly made a great showing for themselves in the purely intellectual
pursuits, such as physics, chemistry (all the hard sciences), mathematics,
et.al.  Have they not?  Why?

<p>
Perhaps it is the combination of two factors that favored the reproductive
success of Mr. Brains over Mr. Buns:


<OL>
  <li>  The dominance of a very complicated religion, combined with...
  <li>  Arranged marriages.


</OL>
<p>
The Jewish religion is filled with minute details, which must be mastered
by memorization in order for one's status to rise within that organization.
The fathers would surely choose Mr. Brains, those in higher standing in
the church over their daughter's preference for Mr. Buns.  Over enough
generations, perhaps this might show up as an intellectual increase in
the genetically isolated group.

<p>
Natasha please indulge me in my dispensing with politically correct-ese,
since we are among friends here, and also considering the light-hearted
nature of this thread.  {8^D  spike
