No, we need a better system that implements the needs of individual
users.  Presumably the transhumanist list started as something
orthogonal to the extropian list.  Some of the technology oriented
lists are orthogonal to one or both of those.  We can't keep
creating orthogonal lists without making the crossposting problem
worse.

<p>
Unlikely, what you need are personalized distribution lists
(push mode) or prioritized presentations (pull mode) to
allow individuals to tune their inputs to their interests.

<p>

<p>
We *are* working on it.  It will require a complex merging
of the available technologies as well as some adaptation
on the part of the users.
