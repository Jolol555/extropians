It's probably already been stated on an earlier post, but could someone
please tell me again:


<p>
<a name="1183qlink1">(1)  How long ago approximately did it become possible (feasible) for
technological civilizations to develop?  IOW, how long *have* they had to
expand?  John refers to 5 billion years above.  Was it really that long ago?
Were there heavy element planets around back then?</a>

<p>
<a name="1183qlink2">(2)  John states that it would be obvious to anyone with eyes that the night
sky was engineered.  Could he or someone else expand on this a bit or give
me a reference.</a>

<p>
Thanks,

<p>
Scott
