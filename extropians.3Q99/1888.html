Well... I'm going to have to mildly disagree with Mike on this one.
I will withhold any and all judgements with regard to Hyperspace
(because I haven't read it) and string theory because its more
</a>
magic physics which is irrelevant until we get to the SI stage.
[It may be the most accurate thing in the world but it doesn't mean
doggy-doo-doo to whether or not you or I become relatively "immortal".]

<p>
However, Kaku's "Visions" book, I have read and generally speaking
it is very accurate.  It is perhaps the "best of the bunch" with regard
to current forecasts of technology trends.  He manages to survey
a wide variety of areas and doesn't get biotechnology completely
inaccurate (as some others do).  He isn't as forward looking as
Moravec is however.  Since I didn't notice any anti-technology
bias in Visions, I'll have to say he isn't a luddite, at least
not in the Jeremy Rifkin sense.

<p>
Mike, you'll have to elaborate on this a bit more to get my vote.
