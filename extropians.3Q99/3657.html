John, you wrote of this before, but as before, the logic
of it escapes me.  Why in the hell would someone lie
if one cannot tell if it is doing any good?  Instead of
claiming to be 25 when you are 32, why not say you
are 32 and find a 32 yr old correspondant?  If you
are tall and bony [you are not, compared to me, btw]
why not just say so and find correspondants who are
not put off by this?  Do explain this please.  spike
