<i>&gt;Is the above really interesting? </i><br>

<p>
Gosh, I didn't know it had to interest you in particular to be
a valid concern.  It sure interests me--from my end things are
pretty darned lonely and sometimes very stressful.  It also interests
the five or so women who
<br>
dropped in on the lists last year, had a miserable experience,
</a>
and wrote to me about it. (and left)  

<p>
<a name="2950qlink2">Also, we are still largely European and Euro-American.  There
is a big expansion ahead, but we are still talking amongst ourselves
as if *we* comprise all there is to transhumanism!  There is
a huge set of perspectives and experiences left untapped, and
we may not get to tap into
</a>
<br>
them unless we make some effort.  "Effort" could simply mean
making<a name="2950qlink3"> ourselves known in forums and networks we hadn't previously
considered.  Simple coalition-building techniques.  Right now
our networking is very
</a>
<br>
narrow in scope, tends to be among those we feel comfortable
with. 

<p>
<a name="2950qlink4"><a href="2896.html#2900qlink2">&gt;We should be looking out for good prospects </a><br>
<i>&gt;in general, without looking for a specific gender (what are</i><br>

serial gender), race (hey, I am  a mix of Swedish, &gt;Italian and
Norwegian), age (we should have more 500 year 
<br>
<a href="2896.html#2900qlink3">&gt;old members, agree to that).</a><br>

<p>
I was very careful not to suggest 'recruting' or 'quotas', and
yet this statement always comes up whenever someone tries to
discuss diversity.  The lurking PC club used to stifle discussion....
