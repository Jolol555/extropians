<a href="1842.html#1854qlink1">&gt;I have been a member of both Mensa and Intertel (International </a><br>
<i>&gt;Legion of Intelligence, upper 1%), but let my memberships lapse </i><br>
<i>&gt;long ago because I found it more interesting to associate with </i><br>
<i>&gt;people with whom I shared interests than with people with whom I </i><br>
<i>&gt;shared test scores.</i><br>

<p>
I found that, as I got older, I was mentally calcifying.  Eating the same
foods, listening to the same music, engaging in the same activities, etc.  
I now make a conscious effort to try new things.  In that light, Mensa can
serve a useful role as one activity among many in exposing me to people
and interests that I might not have known of or considered.

<p>
I think of it as my solution to the hill-climbing problem in AI.  (i.e., if you
are trying to get to the top of the highest hill by always moving higher when
you have a choice you may wind up at a local maxima and miss the big peak.  
A common solution used is to remember the one you found and then repeatedly 
start again somewhere chosen at random, to see if you end up higher.)
