The challenge of creating computer-based human equivalent
intelligence/behavior is prime extropian subject matter.

              THE ATTACK OF THE INCREDIBLE GRADING
                                 MACHINE

I've sometime suspected that, when eventually elaborated, the
self-congratulatory complexity and "sophistication" of human mechanisms of
cognition/consciousness would be found to arise out of humblingly
unsophisticated brute force computational capabilities of bulk assemblages
of neurons.

<p>
By the most fortunate accident, the researchers whose work is the subject
of the above article, may have stumbled upon--perhaps "reinvented"--a basic
mechanism of human linguistic ability--or something fruitfully close to
it--and by doing so brought us one large step closer to understanding the
basic, elegantly humble architecture of mind--one large step closer to
assembling the suite of "meta-neuronal" mechanisms that will eventually
lead to AI.

<p>
The beauty--the delicious irony of this for me--is that they achieved what
they did not by seeking complexity but, quite the contrary, by seeking--and
finding--a sort of moronically-simplistic, number-crunch,
statistical-database-sort-of blunt instrument.  I'm reminded of the ancient
shao-lin lesson:  "Imagine, grasshopper, the sound of one ego deflating." 

<p>
And of course the words of the bard:

<p>
"What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in
faculty, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like
an angel, in apprehension how like a god-the beauty of the world, the
paragon of animals!"

<p>
Beneath the fleshy facade just a bundle of algorithms.  

<p>
Make that "the paragon of meat machines!"
<p>
			Best, Jeff Davis
