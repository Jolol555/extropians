<p>
here's my 2 cents (in poetic form):



<p>
Environ-Mental Retards


<p>
Screw the earth,

<p>
Screw the trees,

<p>
and get up off your god damned knees.

 

<p>
Use this earth, it ain't no sin

<p>
kiss the smokestacks

<p>
that saved your skin!

 

<p>
Deal in facts, not in what you "feel".

<p>
And thank pollution 

<p>
for your next meal.

 

<p>
Screw dumb hippies

<p>
and Al Gore. 

<p>
His name rhymes with poor, bore, whore, and snore.

<p>
What I'm saying goes to the Greens,

<p>

murdered by a

moment.

<p>
thank you, Ken.  When's your next reading?
