<p>
yep, however the differences are generally adaptable.  You kind of
have to look at it like paint on a wall.  You can paint a wood wall
or a plasterboard wall or a brick wall *all* pink.  So most brains
can learn to speak, count, drive a car, etc.  However, if you look
closely, you may discover the underlying texture of the wood,
plasterboard and brick are all pretty different.

Yep. We have so much extra capacity we hardly know what to do with it.
However, I would argue that if you removed an equivalent volume of
the surface of the cortex of a whole brain, you would get a much
different result.

&gt; I find it absurd that so many people without major brain damage,<br>

Not really, the problem is that most of the layers of paint are
put on "externally" without the wall having any conscious
participation or aesthetic sense by which to judge the paint!

<p>
As pointed others and Cynthia have pointed out the educational
system generally speaking promotes *stupid walls*.

Some of us never managed to get into the herd in the first place.

<a name="2724qlink1"><a name="2699qlink1">Lets take a straw poll, how many people in the group
were "outsiders" as children, e.g. played mostly alone,
had only a few friends, or were generally rejected by
the social cliques that educational system produces?
