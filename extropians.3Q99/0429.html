Oh boy, we can tell what era you learned to program in... :-)
The first versions of UNIX ran in &lt; 64KB. Compare the Linux kernel
today with UNIX 25 years ago.  It doesn't do that much more but
it sure is a lot bigger.  [And UNIX systems 25 years ago were
supporting 10-30 users simultaneousy!]

<p>
Big programs don't necessarily perform poorly, though it does take
forever to start them up.  Depending on the application you may
*have* to make a program big (use caches, much special case code,
etc.) to get reasonable performance.  However once you have
made the program this "complex" you have started down the road
of making it more difficult to maintain.

<p>
Balancing size, speed and complexity is the "art" of programming.
