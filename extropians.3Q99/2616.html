Not photons, protons. Solar wind is mostly speeding protons and a bit
of helium nuclei (this is exerting pressure on NASAs new wonderdog
magnetic plasma sail propulsion technology). I thought the 2 Mt/s
figure relies to total Sun mass loss, and solar wind should contribute
the bulk of loss by mass.

Ok, so the energy in question *was* referring to the photonic
output. With current technology can count on trapping maximally ~30%
of the 1.3 kW/m^2. Assuming a FEL efficiency of (very good) %50...

<p>
Relatively. Unfortunately it is not a lot of energy to effect a lot of
spacetime curvature if we consider that it must be focused. It is
roughly two-three orders of magnitude off a usable microsingularity
size I believe.

<p>
If we can do structures that large, a circumsolar proton/antiproton
twin accelerator ring might be a better investment. Here you can be
sure to achieve lots of energy density without all the nasty opaque
vacuum radiative losses. Would make awfully small holes, though.

<p>
That's a bit too brief. You need to feed a hole, and you can't feed a
hole that small radiating that furiously (apart from letting it fall
into a star, letting a large sphere of osmium falling on it is
probably about as efficient as it gets). It is much too blue to be
used for anything anyway. It would fry anything. Before it drowns in
quantum foam you'd get luminosity several times of the Sun (assuming
we trapped 1-10 s of total Solar output in the hole) in ultrahard
gamma dissipated somewhere in deep submicron volumes. This is not
something I'd like to witness from somewhere closer than a good number
of light minutes distance, and a lot of attenuating matter in between.

<p>
Can we count of a superciv being able to focus the entire solar output
in a volume of a few cubic microns (or however it takes to make a
hole), possibly the entire solar output of a few 10 seconds? Methinks
there are very real physical limits at work here. Sufficiently
advanced maybe, but real magic?

<p>
<a href="2605.html#2616qlink7"> &gt; About the best use of black holes is the fact that they don't conserve</a><br>

<p>
A purely theoretical result. Extremely blue radiation does not even
attenuate well. It will just cut through everything, ultrahard gammas
ripping massive swaths of destruction into anything they deign to
interact with. One would want to keep the hole temperature somewhen
below 200 MK, which allows the xRays to be relatively easy attenuated
by a manageable layer of gas.

<p>
Once again, I think the chiefest problem of making holes with photon
flux is avoiding the vacuum to become opaque by pumping virtual
particle pairs into reality. Preparative creatio ex nihile is neat,
but no hole.

<i> &gt; [*] to avoid the circular firing squad's dilemma, more than two beams are</i><br>
<i> &gt; needed so that missed pulses don't fry the opposite launch optics. Four</i><br>
<i> &gt; beams originating at the corners of a tetrahedron should work... but more</i><br>

<p>
For energy containment reasons alone it is very obvious one need to
fire a very large amount of circumsolar units simultaneously into a
very precise quadrant of space. Because of the distances involved one
needs not fear to hit any opposite firing stations.  The drift
velocity of the resulting hole might be near zero. Oops, just don't
let it fall back into the star. (Unless you want to experiment with a
DIY GRB from *real close*, that is).
