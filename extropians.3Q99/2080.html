How do we define "insanity"?  I was involuntary committed to a 
psychiatric hospital.

As a result, I believe I'm no longer able to purchase a handgun, from 
now into eternity.

<p>
My crime was to ramp up to too high of a dosage of Wellbutrin and 
Prozac, resulting in 2 days of insomnia, then drifting into sleep and 
a dream in which I walked outside and jogged in place on my front 
lawn.

<p>
Am I allowed to keep the URL "ifeden.com", or do I lack the sanity 
required for a license to communicate on the web to such a potential 
mass audience, including children and students?

<p>
P.S. I'm off the Prozac.  Current cocktail of sanity is:

<pre>
   Lithium 1200Mg/day - Mood stabilizer, reduces manic episodes
   Lamictal 100Mg/day - Anti-seizure medication, also helps bipolar
   Risperdal  2Mg/day - Anti-psychotic, reduces magical thinking
   Ritalin   80Mg/day - Help mental focus and concentration
   Effexor  150Mg/day - Anti-depressant, anti-anxiety

</pre>
<p>
If AT&amp;T, or excuse me, Internic, yank the domain from me, who gets it 
next?  Is it a raffle, or shared resources through equal stock?

<p>
Sometimes I like to see the handwriting on the wall.
