Oh, I see what you mean.

Science can shatter true illusions after it shatters the false ones, I
guess.

Blind parents producing blind children create the Wellsian "Country of The
Blind" that Joseph C. Freeman mentioned.

Enlightened parents have it easy... knowing that if you really love your
kids, you won't have any. Let kids figure things out for themselves,  just
get out of their way (or share the way). They have to learn to think for
themselves, and to meditate for themselves. Visionaries make more trouble
for their parents than other kids do, and they _really_ shake things up as
parents. Which explains why kids love them, and parents hate them.
