I disagree.  That's like saying that only a tiny fraction of a computer
is "conscious" because the vast majority of transistors in the CPU
cannot be directly tested.  It takes a huge amount of low-level stuff to
support our high-level thoughts.  There are no hidden high-level
thoughts.  There's no "unconsciousness" capable of independent cognition.

<p>
There are very few conditions under which a true unconscious desire is
more adaptive than a true conscious one - I think these situations are
too few, and too inconsistent, to create a selection pressure for
suppressing cognition.  There are many times when self-deception is
adaptive, but that is not actually unconsciousness; that is refusing to
admit something of which you are consciously aware.  There are a good
many emotions which result in inconsistent actions and internal beliefs
about those actions; both are still conscious.  The discipline of
<a name="4010qlink2"><a name="3765qlink1">self-awareness occurs first by learning to admit the things lurking in
the corners of your mind; second by studying the evolutionary origin of
our conscious motives; not, at any point, by bringing unconscious
cognition into consciousness.</a></a>
