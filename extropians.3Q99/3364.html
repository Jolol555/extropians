&gt;What's the Answer?

<p>
&gt;The only way out of this is to defeat the presumption that you are the
&gt;surety for the Straw Man (legal fiction).

<pre>
&gt;The "Redemption Process", otherwise called the "Acceptance for Value"
&gt;process, is the most promising way to defeat this presumption, using the
&gt;Uniform Commercial Code which is the "law" that the fictional commercial
&gt;world operates under.

&gt;The first step is to "Capture the Straw Man." This is done by filing a
</pre>
&gt;UCC-1 financing statement to secure a claim against the all capitalized
&gt;legal fiction, or Straw Man.

<pre>
&gt;The next step is to accept your birth certificate for value and become
&gt;the Holder in Due Course of that document. You will also want to accept
&gt;for value your Drivers License and the Social Security Number that was
&gt;assigned to the Straw Man.

&gt;The UCC-1 claim and the acceptance of these documents will REDEEM you
</pre>
&gt;from the commercial system and establish documented evidence to defeat
&gt;the presumption that you are the surety for the Straw Man.



<p>
One problem with this theory is that the State does not consider the Uniform
Commercial
<br>
Code to trump the Constitution.  Another is that jurisprudence does not
consider the so-called 
<br>
Social Contract to be voidable.  I.E., merely saying "I disclaim any
priviledges under the social 
<br>
contract and thus an released from any obligations." just isn't ever going
to fly.  Saying that 
<br>
one disclaims same as attorney/agent for the legal fiction of oneself is
really not going to work.
<br>
Anyhow, it is a cute rant. IMHO.
