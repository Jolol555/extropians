<i>&gt; &gt; If you stick to Wintel machines, you could argue that since MS says</i><br>
<i>&gt; their</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; products are secure, and since they have a history of not telling the</i><br>
<i>&gt; whole</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; story re: APIs for their "OSes", then the security holes must in fact be</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hidden APIs, and that their system is thus designed to allow this kind</i><br>
<i>&gt; of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; radical distributed computing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; A) Microsoft has repeatedly stated that Windows 95/98 is not secure, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not</i><br>
<i>&gt; intended to be secure, and should not be used by anyone who is concerned</i><br>
<i>&gt; about security.  Its security measures are intended to stop curious</i><br>
<i>&gt; co-workers and children, not experienced hackers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B) Windows NT security is not any easier to crack than UNIX systems</i><br>
<i>&gt; (actually I would argue that it is substantially better on average, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; most UNIX sites are running older implementations with relatively feeble</i><br>
<i>&gt; security measures, but the lower quality of NT administration</i><br>
<i>&gt; counterbalances this).  The only reliable method is to use a Trojan Horse</i><br>
<i>&gt; program, and that carries a very high risk of detection.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; C) All OSes have security holes.  All OS vendors (AFAIK) make a strong</i><br>
<i>&gt; effort to plug them as soon as they are discovered.  The effort they put</i><br>
<i>&gt; into getting these fixes to customers varies a great deal from one vendor</i><br>
<i>&gt; to</i><br>
<i>&gt; another.  There is nothing in Microsoft's business practices that</i><br>
<i>&gt; distinguishes it from any other vendor in this regard.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; These points aside, your argument is legally equivalent to claiming that</i><br>
<i>&gt; the</i><br>
<i>&gt; company that built your office building should be liable if your office</i><br>
<i>&gt; gets</i><br>
<i>&gt; burglarized.  It doesn't work that way (which is a good thing, because it</i><br>
<i>&gt; is</i><br>
<i>&gt; not possible to construct a perfect security system).  The burden of</i><br>
<i>&gt; ensuring that your posessions are defended by an adequate level of</i><br>
<i>&gt; security</i><br>
<i>&gt; (and deciding what exactly is 'adequate') rests entirely on your</i><br>
<i>&gt; shoulders.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Perhaps they could even be sued for then patching said holes, for</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; anti-competitive practices?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Would you think this statement made sense if we were talking about Linux?</i><br>

Easy there big guy! I was just having a go at MS because they're a big
target (side of a barn?) - looks like I missed anyway. But as Foghorn
Leghorn says, "That's a joke, son".

<p>
I'm in league with Satan too by the way; Linux shminux (now minix, there's
another story...). I thought I was on the side of light (Delphi's project
Jedi places it there, at least rhetorically), but then MS bought up lots of
Inprise ne Borland- no sorry, entered into a partnering arrangement
involving licensing &amp; large sums of money moving from MS to Inprise ne
Borland - so evidently I have crossed over to the dark side.
