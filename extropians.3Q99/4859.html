My original proposal was to split the list in two parts: exi-moderated
and exi-rejected. I would hardly call that censorship because by
subscribing to both list you still would get the full picture. (Btw, I
know of at least one technical list which runs that way).

<p>
Of course I agree that this approach is too crude, personal
server-side filtering would have been much better, and hardly more
difficult to implement. Btw, what is the state of the new list
structure implementation project? (Sorry, I've not been paying
attention lately).

Mike, these topics are supposed to be banned. Discuss them off-list as
much as you wish, but please not here.
