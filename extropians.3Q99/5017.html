Ah, but they swear to 'protect and serve', don't they? If they are our
servants they should do what we dam# well tell them to do. They get
those nice pensions, benefits, etc that a private police officer could
only hope for. Heck, even old Cal Coolidge, probably the most
libertarian president of the century, said,"nobody has a right to strike
against the publics safety" when he broke the Bostom Police Strike back
when he was in local politics...
