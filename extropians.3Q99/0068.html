<a name="0136qlink3"><i>&gt; A high-computing-power capitalist economy can get along perfectly fine</i><br>

<i>&gt; percentage of the dividends from that plant - that's my "stock".</a></i><br>

<p>
Yes, so in what way is this "no stock market whatsoever"?  As you 
allude to below, this is *exactly* a stock market.  Unless you're 
suggesting that you wouldn't have the right to turn around and sell 
your right to a percentage of the dividends.

<p>
<i>&gt;  When</i><br>
<a href="0003.html#0068qlink2">&gt; the manufacturing plant shuts down, the dividends stop.  If they managed</a><br>
<i>&gt; to generate enough revenue, I make a profit.  If not, not.  No</i><br>
<i>&gt; information loss, and when I want my money to make money, I actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; give it to people who will use it to make money, not to the previous</i><br>
<i>&gt; investor who buys a speedboat.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0136qlink5"><i>&gt; In practice, you would quickly get a market in stocks, and people would</i><br>
<i>&gt; buy stocks from one another based on how they think the future is going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to work out, and eventually you would get people buying "growth stocks"</i><br>
<i>&gt; again.  I'm just pointing out that shuttling all the day traders into</i><br>
<i>&gt; actual casinos isn't going to hurt the economy.  Nor would creating an</i><br>
<i>&gt; enormously higher rate of actual capital investment (so that the money</i><br>
<i>&gt; now flooding into the stock market would go to buy actual machinery</i><br>
<i>&gt; instead of speedboats) kill the market by flooding it with new stocks.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0136qlink6"><i>&gt; In other words, there are three elements in the modern market:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  The person with money, who wants to turn that money into more money,</i><br>
<i>&gt; by giving it to someone who will produce wealth.  Presently filled by</i><br>
<i>&gt; venture capitalists.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0136qlink7"><i>&gt; 2)  The person who thinks he sees a piece of property, such as the right</i><br>
<i>&gt; to receive a certain percentage of dividends, which is undervalued.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Presently filled by small investors.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0136qlink8"><i>&gt; 3)  People who think they know which way the market will go and are</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to bet on it.  Presently filled by day traders.</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0136qlink9"><i>&gt; Right now, the stock market is a mess.  The first problem is that most</i><br>
<i>&gt; small investors want to do (1), a positive-sum game, but are stuck with</i><br>
<i>&gt; (2), a zero-sum game; and the second problem is that the people doing</i><br>
<i>&gt; (3), a _highly volatile_, mathematically chaotic zero-sum game, are</i><br>
<i>&gt; forced to buy actual stocks in the same market as (1) and (2).</a></i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0136qlink10"><i>&gt; What we need is, (a) actual market-gambling casinos; (b) some way for</i><br>
<i>&gt; small guys to join venture-capital cooperatives.  That'll go a *long*</i><br>
<i>&gt; way towards untangling the unholy mess.</a></i><br>

<p>
No this won't work.  Very interesting reading, though.  But
it seems clear to me that the market value of a stock is
determined by a simple formula of supply and demand, and I
can't see how your suggestion would affect that, or what
incentive people would have for opting for your "casinos",
instead of the real market.

<p>
<a name="0136qlink11">What we have now is a vast pyramid scheme, which has not yet
collapsed.  The value of the stocks continues to climb 
because each buyer is borrowing against the future, betting
that she can get out with her dough before the whole thing
folds.</a>  I can't see how any casino that you devise could have
that kind of indefinite ability to ride up the values.  A
casino is definitely a zero-sum game in the short term.
As you pointed out, (2) and (3) are also zero-sum games, but
*in the long term*.  For now, and probably for several more
years, everyone can expect to win!

<p>
What really scares me is the government's toying with the idea
of investing the Social Security trust fund in the stock 
market.  Not that I expect to ever see a dime of SS.  But,
clearly, I do expect to see the whole stock market come to a
devastating crash at some point when a good percentage of the
baby-boomers retire, and start cashing in.  I don't see an
easy solution though.  As long as the market is free, nobody
can stop someone from paying ridiculous prices for a stock.
