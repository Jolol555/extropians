True! The WTA is supposed to be a completely decentralized 
organization, but I don't think we have communicated that 
sufficiently well. Many members and non-members don't realize that 
they can do pretty much what they want with the WTA. The organization 
is there mostly to coordinate our activities and to provide a
quality-check. (And of course, if something were to be deemed "not 
suitable" for inclusion under the WTA label, the author or 
constructor or whatever can go ahead and do it anyway outside the 
WTA.)

This is an excellent example of the kind of initiative that is 
needed. Don't sit around waiting for orders from somebody. If someone 
isn't interested or hasn't got time to do something, that's one 
thing.<a name="3014qlink1"> But it seems that there are many people who have both interest 
and at least some time, but somehow lack *gumption* unless 
explicitly told what to do by somebody else. Max and Natasha didn't 
receive a phone call telling them to organize Extro-4. Ok, most of us 
aren't that driven, so we also need to give each other encouragement 
and support. But in the end, the initiative typically lies with the 
individual one or with small groups of people who meet each other 
face-to-face.</a>
