<a href="5159.html#5176qlink1">&gt;In anticipation of any request for citatation, a recommendation</a><br>
<i>&gt;for this engaging little book, found in the computer section of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Borders:</i><br>

<p>
<a href="5159.html#5176qlink2">&gt;_Rules of the Net_ by Thomas Mandel and Gerard Van der Leun,</a><br>
<i>&gt;Hyperion Books.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="5159.html#5176qlink3">&gt;One of the utter beauties of the Internet is that anyone, anyone,</a><br>
<i>&gt;who can plug a terminal into a keyboard and hard drive can get on</i><br>
<i>&gt;and talk to others.  So what if someone still uses Pine?  Pine is</i><br>
<i>&gt;the way that dissidents in third world countries are getting their</i><br>
<i>&gt;messages out to others to find the way to freedom.  So what if</i><br>
<i>&gt;Telnet is going defunct? People in China still use it as a way to</i><br>
<i>&gt;circumvent government censorship. So what if someone doesn't have</i><br>
<i>&gt;the latest system--so long as the emails get out, and can go back.</i><br>


<p>
I just wanted to restate that I was not attacking anything you
wrote, I enjoy your posts, in fact loved the one just now about
"virtual clubing" (a good use of the Internet).

<p>
All of your posts after my initial post were in excellent format,
In the post I quoted earlier I noticed you were quoting from
someone elses post, so perhaps it is your editor that is performing
the "unusual" formatting.

<p>
To paraphrase Greil Marcus from "Lipstick Traces" "If punk was a
secret society, the goal of every secret society is to take over
the world, just as the goal of every rock 'n' roll band is to make
everyone listen."<a name="5181qlink1"> Likewise I assume you'd like your posts to be
read, and your opinion considered.</a>

<p>
I apologize if anything I said wasn't clear....
