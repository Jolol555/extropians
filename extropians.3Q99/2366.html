The wavefunction is an abstraction that humans find useful in thinking

is possibly right, if you do see interference bands Copenhagen is dead and
many worlds is probably correct.

There are only two possible outcomes, what's your prediction, do we get
interference bands or not, how do you place your bet?</a></a>
