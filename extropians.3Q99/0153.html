Far from seeing the pleasures and benefits of love and friendship as being 
threatened by the kinds of technological transformation to which we look 
forward, I see the prospect of enhancement of these feelings and 
relationships.  Love and friendship grow out of shared values, goals and life 
experiences.  I don't see that basic truth changing, although the ways that 
these relationships are formed and the feelings are expressed will.  

<p>
Consider the life of a pre-modern human.  For most of human history and 
prehistory, an individual's circle of social interaction was restricted to 
the small handful of people in one's extended family or tribe.  Every 
individual with whom a person came into contact had essentially the same life 
experience and prospects, within a fairly narrow range of diversity dictated 
by simple sexual and narrow cultural bounds.  With the development of writing 
and transportation technologies like the domestication of the horse, a few 
privileged individuals were able to expand their social sphere to include 
distant people with more diverse life experiences.  In the last two hundred 
years the proportion of people able to enjoy that diversity, and the range of 
the available diversity for social interaction, has broadened dramatically.

<p>
Transhuman technologies promise an acceleration of this broadening of social 
horizons, but the fundamental values upon which love and friendship are based 
won't change, in my opinion.  Just as today I am able to form friendships 
with people who are distant in space and life experience through the use of 
jet aircraft, telephones and the internet, with the new technologies to which 
we look forward, we will continue to expand the range of entities with whom 
we can form bonds of shared values and life experiences.  Imagine how much 
deeper and richer friendships with distant comrades will be with mature 
virtual reality.  Imagine how enriched friendships will be when much higher 
bandwidth communication will be possible.  And the prospect of friendships 
that extend in time vastly beyond the mere eight decades to which natural 
humans are condemned to live is truly wonderful!

<p>
I recently watched Ken Burns' wonderful documentary about Thomas Jefferson.  
He did a fantastic job of depicting the tender reconciliation between 
Jefferson and Adams in the correspondence of their last twenty years.  
Imagine if that renewed friendship had not been cut off by their deaths!  The 
shared life experience of the two men formed a basis for a deep and fruitful 
friendship in a context that the younger men -- who had for a time become 
political "enemies" -- could not imagine.

<p>
In his fiction Greg Egan has explored how love and friendship might persist 
through even the longest and most transformed lives.  In "Permutation City" I 
recall how the main characters maintained a core of emotional connection 
across the fantastic automorphism of two uploaded humans.  And in "Diaspora" 
he explores how entities from vastly different beginnings and with completely 
different goals and basic cognitive forms reach across such gulfs to form 
friendships and find love.  I highly recommend those books for a view of how 
the fundamental values of love and friendship will persist in a radically 
post-human world.
  
<p>
<a href="0088.html#0153qlink4">&gt;  A related question:  what are the evolutionary advantages to love and </a><br>
<i>&gt; friendship?</i><br>
<i>&gt;  What non-human species do you think have these experiences?</i><br>

<p>
I think it's clear that animals co-evolved these emotional responses in 
connection with the selective advantage of social life.  I have certainly 
seen what appears to be only a slightly more primitive version of our own 
feelings of love and friendship among the non-human primates I've observed 
closely.
