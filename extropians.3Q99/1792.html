<a href="1779.html#1792qlink2">&gt;I would argue that whether or not we manipulate the &gt;“Sub-sub-quantum processes” is not important. We have no &gt;choice over that manipulation. That action (or the</a><br>

<p>
Genetics has no bearing on our decisions if we've already
uploaded our brains into computronium structures and
completely re-written or erased any residual memetic
processes that originated through blind genetic evolution.

<p>
What is conditioning if we are re-wiring that as well?  I
have been quite sucessful in reprogramming a whole series of
conditioned responses.  So who is doing the re-conditioning?
We find ourselves in an infinite regress, so there is no
remaining merit in your answer.
