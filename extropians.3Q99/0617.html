This was a marketing ploy and was so heavily qualified as to be a worthless
claim.  In the commercial space, very large databases handle tens of
terabytes of online data (possibly more these days) and the very largest
data warehouses can run around a petabyte or larger.  The fact that
multi-petabyte storage arrays exist indicates that somebody is probably
using them.  Microsoft claimed their database was the largest on the web,
but as I recall, this was refuted by IBM who has multi-terabyte databases
(such as their patent database which at the time was supposed to be around
3-Tb) connected to the web.

<a name="0622qlink1">Microsoft was trying to appeal to the PHB types who are easily impressed by
the word "terabyte".  Only a fool would try to run a large online database
on a Microsoft OS, but I've seen numerous people try at places I've worked.
 The results have always been less than impressive.</a>
