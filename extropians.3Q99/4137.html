	In the meantime, we would like to inform you that one of our scopes for
JASS is to have Special Issues on a specific Application Domain of Systems
Sciences. For the next year we are going to have two special issues. You
may propose to us an area related to JASS in which I expect you will act as
the "Guest Editor" under, of course, the general operating rules of JASS.
