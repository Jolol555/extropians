Being engaged in a dialogue in another forum that has included this question, 
I have some thoughts ready to hand on the subject.  Taking into account that 
the following is part of a larger context, I pass along some of my current 
thinking on the question you pose:

<p>
. . . "[T]he distinction between transhumanism and extropianism" is a subject 
that sparks quite a bit of discussion - so much so that I've given up trying 
to be involved in every such discussion I'm aware of.  Many people say that 
extropianism is somehow a subset of transhumanism.  I prefer to say that 
extropian values are transhumanist and that extropianism is a transhumanist 
philosophy.  My personal, perhaps quite idiosyncratic take on the question is 
that extropianism is a world-view that derives from valuing what happens in 
nature when complexity spontaneously creates information processing systems 
(thus my ethical system of "mind morality").  We are most uniquely such 
systems and thus valuing this is simply a function of self-actualization and 
self-valuation.  From a simple application of the Golden Rule (which is 
really just an extension of the "cosmological principle" of "no privileged 
observers" to the realm of values), other extropian values of tolerance and 
non-initiation of force or coercion are derived. . . .

<p>
. . . But "transhumanism" as a cultural movement does not, I believe, purport 
to be an all-encompassing world view in the same way that most religions 
purport to be, for instance.  It is compatible with a wide (but not 
indefinite) range of basic world-views.  Thus there could be socialist 
transhumanists and even, I suppose, nihilist transhumanists, just as there 
are socialist and nihilist humanists.  (I believe one could not be an 
"extropian nihilist" and it would be difficult, I imagine, to try to craft an 
"extropian socialism".) . . .

<p>
. . . "Transhumanism" is as broad a term as "humanism"; the "transhumanist 
dialogue" has just begun, in many ways (although I'm often amazed at the few 
prescient pathfinders we can look to as intellectual forebearers - like 
Butler's Erewhon and Shelley's Frankenstein).  Consider "transhumanism" to be 
a defined arena in which discussion should take place - some of the few 
"constraints" on that dialogue being a value system that encourages 
individual autonomy and a continuation of the process of increasing human 
potential.  Within that arena, extropians have a more clearly defined set of 
values - essentially those of the Enlightenment; if Thomas Jefferson had 
lived today I feel absolutely sure he would have been an extropian. . . .
