Not being entirely familiar with NH and MA, would have to look more closely 
at it.  BTW, Sounds like the only thing they have in common is location and 
population density...I wonder what other differences there might be?

Personally, I think a well armed general population probably does decrease 
some types of violent crime.  Indeed, I have heard that analyses done on 
states which have had changes in their concealed carry laws seem to show that 
increases in the ability of people to legally carry concealed firearms tend 
to decrease violent crime rates (note, some of the statistics on this have 
been questioned as per accuracy).  Also, I remember hearing many years back 
that Kennesaw&lt;sp&gt; Co, Georgia, made it a requirement that adults have a gun 
in the house, and they also seemed to have a 
decrease in violent crime.
