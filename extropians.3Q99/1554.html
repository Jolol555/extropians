Now that you have explained it to me, I will put it into my official Quack
file with crystal healing and snake-oil.

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since besides Technotranscendence (Daniel Ust)'s public posting, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;received several private messages expressing interest in</i><br>
<i>&gt;homeopathy, I will elaborate.  I will cite scientific studies in another</i><br>
<i>&gt;posting.  First, I want to explain some of the procedure.  (There are</i><br>
<i>&gt;hundreds of textbooks, so I'm skipping a lot.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Homeopaths have a well-developed theory of medicine.  I think it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;similar to epicycles in astronomy or Newtonian physics -- the best</i><br>
<i>&gt;explanation at the time for observed results, ultimately to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;superceded when a better theory comes along.  In what I write</i><br>
<i>&gt;below, I'm using their explanations, in their terminology.  When I</i><br>
<i>&gt;have personal experience with something, I say so.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Homeopaths "prove" a substance by carefully documenting all effects</i><br>
<i>&gt;shown by giving a large dose to healthy subjects, including subjective</i><br>
<i>&gt;changes in mental or emotional state.  A remedy is prepared by</i><br>
<i>&gt;mixing the substance with distilled water, and progressively diluting</i><br>
<i>&gt;it.  This is called "potentizing".  Between each dilution step, the mixture</i><br>
<i>&gt;must be vigorously shaken.  If it is not, the remedy has no effect.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Counter-intuitively, the more times the remedy has been diluted, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;more potent it is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In many people the remedy has no effect if it is taken within half an</i><br>
<i>&gt;hour of eating, if you touch it, X-ray it, or eat or drink something strong</i><br>
<i>&gt;(menthol, camphor, mint, coffee) while under homeopathic treatment.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In the homeopathic view of physiology, each of us has a fundamental</i><br>
<i>&gt;body type.  On top of that, every time we have any trauma that doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt;heal properly or an ailment is suppressed, another layer is built on.</i><br>
<i>&gt;And there are common pathways -- suppressed symptoms manifest</i><br>
<i>&gt;themselves later on as a predictable something more serious.  Like</i><br>
<i>&gt;taking cortisone often leads to asthma later.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;When you see a homeopath, he asks you dozens of questions.  There is</i><br>
<i>&gt;not one remedy for headaches -- there are hundreds.  And if you don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;take the right one, it won't work.  So just going to a pharmacy and</i><br>
<i>&gt;getting something labelled "headache" won't work.  The homeopath</i><br>
<i>&gt;is looking for a pattern of symptoms that closely resembles the</i><br>
<i>&gt;toxicological pattern identified during the proving of a remedy.  You are</i><br>
<i>&gt;given a diluted version of something that causes the same symptoms.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In practice, when your head aches, you don't want to be sitting with a</i><br>
<i>&gt;Materia Medica and Repertory trying to find the right remedy.  So I</i><br>
<i>&gt;use homeopathy for problems where I can stand waiting for the right</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer and I'm not satisfied with the allopathic alternative.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Now, not every pattern is hard to match.  In some cases, there's an</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious first choice.  If you have a skin rash, Rhus Toxicodendron</i><br>
<i>&gt;(poison ivy) is worth a try.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;There are about 1000 remedies in use, but a home kit of 50 (for $80)</i><br>
<i>&gt;covers most of what people commonly need.  I will take 6 old favorites</i><br>
<i>&gt;on a trip.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With high-potency remedies, the patient may feel worse before getting</i><br>
<i>&gt;better, as previously suppressed symptoms are re-experienced and</i><br>
<i>&gt;healed.  This difference between a low-potency and high-potency</i><br>
<i>&gt;remedy, which is commonly seen, should not occur under Lee Daniel</i><br>
<i>&gt;Crocker's theory of the world.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In my view, each of the schools of medicine that has some legitimacy</i><br>
<i>&gt;(like Chinese traditional medicine, acupuncture, allopathic medicine,</i><br>
<i>&gt;homeopathy, and chiropractic) has a part of the picture.  I can't wait</i><br>
<i>&gt;we've built an integrated theory of biologic functioning that</i><br>
<i>&gt;encompasses each system's insights.  It's happening slowly,</i><br>
<i>&gt;hampered especially by conventional medicine's perennial assumption</i><br>
<i>&gt;that they have all the answers and no one else does.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I see a naturopath sometimes.  He has the equivalent of regular</i><br>
<i>&gt;medical school training, plus extra training in a dozen alternate</i><br>
<i>&gt;therapies.  Mine specializes in homeopathy, nutrition, and herbal</i><br>
<i>&gt;medicine.  (I also have a regular MD that I see as needed.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;What do I like?  He asks me about all aspects of my physical, mental,</i><br>
<i>&gt;and emotional state.  I am an active participant in my diagnosis and</i><br>
<i>&gt;treatment.  He freely admits when he is stumped.  He readily refers</i><br>
<i>&gt;me to another practitioner (MD, chiropractor, ...) when they are better</i><br>
<i>&gt;suited for my condition.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For example, he says pneumonia can be treated homeopathically but</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's very tricky.  You have to take the right remedies at the right times.</i><br>
<i>&gt;He'd rather send you to a regular MD and then treat you afterwards</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the damage done to your intestinal flora by the broad-spectrum</i><br>
<i>&gt;antibiotics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;For the record, I've tried a few of them myself.  I found one for</i><br>
allergies
<br>
<a href="1539.html#1554qlink2">&gt;&gt;seemed to work quite well (I think it was Naturapathic brand stuff) the</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;_first_ time I used it, but proved ineffective later on.  (Now, I stick to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;vitamin B5, which works just fine for me as long as I take a sufficiently</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;high dose.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The remedy stopped working because the pattern changed, and you</i><br>
<i>&gt;needed to switch to another remedy.  (It may have changed because you</i><br>
<i>&gt;healed the outermost layer, and exposed the problem below it.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I hope you are taking the B5 along with the rest of the B complex.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt;can cause metabolic imbalances if you don't.  I used to have bad</i><br>
<i>&gt;allergies myself.  When I take 4+ grams of vitamin C daily, I don't sneeze</i><br>
<i>&gt;at all, no matter how high the pollen count is.</i><br>
