<a name="4368qlink1">Precisely:  Now imagine a society in which there were no jails, just gates.  
You can go pretty much anywhere if you're bonded sufficiently, and the bond 
reflects the risk assessed by those in the business of making accurate risk 
assessments.  Obviously, each individual would balance bond costs against 
the costs of building reputation, credibility, etc.</a>  The risks would also 
<a name="4368qlink2">vary according to many different dimensions.  A Hezbollah (sp?) member might 
find the bond prohibitive in getting into certain Jewish temples or schools, 
but very slight in getting into the local Mosque.</a>  A criminal or a drunk 
would pay the costs to society directly in terms of financing his associated 
risk through bonds and/or insurance.
<br>
Certain geographic or brand name / pseudo-corporate entities would probably 
cater to those who couldn't get into Irvine, I suspect, and you might have 
your thieves quarters, Casbah's, etc., but little need for any actual 
prisons.  A person who refused to pay assessed costs for his behavior 
directly would find himself virtually outlawed by most of society until he 
paid his tab.
<br>
The level of this discussion that I am particularly interested in, however, 
should anyone else like to pursue it, is how this all fits in with the 
evolution of extropian society.  Clearly, TANSTAAFL holds, even when we all 
become distributed uploads.  When we can instantly clone ourselves, who gets 
the cyber-space?  How are disputes resolved?  What opportunities for 
criminal behavior will emerge?
<br>
I see the web as a primitive testbed for many of these questions and 
concepts.  It is also both a transitional media and a potential 
revolutionary vehicle.  Microsoft, the old money (of which Gates is an 
example), the banks, the real estate interests, the sexists and racists and 
nationalists, the statists: all are stacked on one side of the potential 
future (or lack thereof) for the species - or meta-species.  LINUX, open 
source, the web itself, the microloans program:  all are examples of the 
other side, in which physical capital alone (i.e., the dead weight of the 
past) is not the determining force, but rather systems that have evolved 
because they produce results, because they represent truth, in the sense 
that they, as opposed to the other side, possess inherent mechanisms that 
orient to truth.  They self-correct, without the need of some guru or 
dictator or CEO to force it down our throats.
