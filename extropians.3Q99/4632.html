&lt;&lt; Okay, well, this is beginning to sound a bit personal.  People who know me
 will tell you that I am a very playful person, that I consider it very
 important as personal growth, and that I am always trying to drag members
 of the local DC group out to have some fun!  Arjen Kamphuis gave a
 wonderful speech at the first Transvision about pushing human limits
 through playful experiences, and that touched me deeply.  
 
<p>
 I hope that in the future you will get to know me better, and that maybe we
 can go out and have some fun togethe &gt;&gt;

Yes this part of the post was not directed directly at you, and if it seemed 
so please except my apology. And it is not directed at any Extropian 
personally. I've found that in person, people tend to be far more polite, 
funny, imaginative and so forth.
<br>
Especially people who have quattereled with me rudely online, may in person 
be charming and sweet! ( of course they dont know who I am). I am glad to 
know you like to socialize.

<a name="4673qlink1">Sorry, if it sounded like, it wasn't an attack on you - it was a musing upon 
Exilist- how when presented with ideas from whatever realm, often instead of 
catching the ball and playing with it, it's kicked back critically  ...let's 
say  "some of the people, some of the time".</a>

Thank you that's the spirit!
