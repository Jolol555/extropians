:&gt; So, in other words, this is such a sticky problem that we should have 
<br>
<a href="1900.html#1912qlink1">&gt; government make all the decisions?  Somehow, that seems less than ideal to </a><br>
<i>&gt; me.</i><br>

<p>
No, you should know me better than that.  I generally view authoratarian
solutions as poor.  The two very *fuzzy* points, that I belive *society*
needs to discuss are -- Is any germline engineering justifyable?  and
If you can do germline engineering -- where do you stop?  (society can impose
behavior norms where governments would never tread -- even though they
may be wrong!!)

<p>
<a href="1900.html#1912qlink2">&gt; Or do you really want to see a regulatory agency defining "enhancement", </a><br>
<i>&gt; "treatment", "necessity" and so forth according to whatever political </i><br>
<i>&gt; forces happen to apply at the time?</i><br>

<p>
I think a "regulatory agency" would never really work.  I think more
awareness on the part of perspective parents on the pressures, desires,
"genetic drives", etc. that they feel and dictate their actions would
be useful.

<a name="2088qlink1">Why should you *care* if your children are smart/beautiful/successful,
etc.?  If you do care, are you *absolutely sure* that you are making
such opinions of your own free will or whether you have programmed
into thinking such by million year old genetic machinery?
