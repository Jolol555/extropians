Well, it's not realistic to take back the vote. Even if women's
suffrage was not justified at the time, it pretty much is now.

<p>
Let me explain. Voting is a non-violent (more or less) substitute
for fighting to settle differences. Men were assumed to be more
or less equal as fighters, so a majority vote (among men) was a
predictor of how a war over the issue would come out. But women
couldn't vote because women couldn't fight.

<p>
But this is no longer true. With modern weapons women are roughly
<a name="4307qlink1">equal in fighting ability to men. They even serve in the armed
forces of the USA, even in some combat roles.</a>

<p>
My suggestion is to put a twist on the "for the children"
rhetoric. When the subject of giving up civil rights "for the
children" comes up, rather than "selfishly" demanding to keep
YOUR right at the "expense" of the children. Just ask the Soccermoms,
 "do you want your children to grow up free or as slaves?"
Might make them think a bit.
