I still think *discomfort* with anything pleasurable and non-harmful 
is a result of abuse and victorian social conditioning.

<p>
This list is filled with scientists who can be pretty clinical and 
descriptive about things: frozen mice, body organs, brains, etc.

<p>
On the topic of sexuality, changing brain chemistry or wiring will 
have profound effect on hedonistic behaviors.  I'm sure for those who 
"walk the line" or are "on the fence" drugs might have played a part 
in their experimentation.  Cocaine or Ecstacy have done much for 
suppressing inhibitions.

<p>
I normally don't find obese woman physically attractive, but tried 
coke once with an obese coworker after work one night.  For about ten 
minutes, she looked good.  Didn't close the deal though!  Crashed so 
bad I felt like hell for about a day, and was a little embarrassed at 
what might have transpired had there been more white powder 
available.

In terms of what we "don't need to know", I thought the Starr report 
detailing Bill and Monica's sexual play was "too much information".

<p>
Then again, in an age of nanotechnology, inexpensive through-the-wall 
radar, invisible fisheye lensed cameras with wireless 
telemetry...it's always interesting to know the workings of the minds 
on the enlightened side of surveillance feeds.  They surely become 
desensitized voyeurs who view people as "subjects" and things, IT 
rather than HE or SHE.

<p>
The extropian list is like a form of surveillance, giving the wise 
lurkers a chance to understand the pathology of those who may be near 
some of the more valuable thinkers and technologies.  If my whole 
life was on quantum dot cell memory, or molecular tape, it would be a 
action porno horror situation comedy suspense thriller drama.
