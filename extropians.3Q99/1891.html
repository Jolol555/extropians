&gt; The *sticky* point in my mind is we are entering the time when treatments
&gt; that are entirely "enhancements", rather than "necessities" are available.
&gt; If the Extropian principles are those which should encourage diversity,
&gt; minimize tyranny, manipulation/control by power bodies/majorities
&gt; (including parents or medical authorities), etc., then it would seem to
&gt; me that --
&gt;   Extropians should be fundamentally opposed to all germline or
&gt;   childhood gene therapies that are not essential for the survival
&gt;   of the individual (to a time where they an give "informed consent").

I argued the opposite last October:

<p>
<i>: Under what circumstances is it legitimate to alter the genome and create</i><br>
<i>: a genetically altered person who is better adapted to some environments</i><br>
<i>: but worse for others?  In space, the legless person, or someone with</i><br>
<i>: hands instead of feet, may have an advantage.  But you can't ask in</i><br>
<i>: advance.</i><br>
<i>: </i><br>
<i>: The question is related to the issue of whether it is right to bring</i><br>
<i>: children into the world in other circumstances where their choices may</i><br>
<i>: be limited.</i><br>
<i>: </i><br>
<i>: Historically, people have had the right to raise their offspring into</i><br>
<i>: virtually any circumstances.  They travel to dangerous new continents and</i><br>
<i>: raise children in hard conditions.  Nobody asks the kids if they mind;</i><br>
<i>: it's impossible to do so until after their born, and then it's too late.</i><br>
<i>: [...]</i><br>
<i>: If we accept the</i><br>
<i>: historical precedent for parents to have children in environments which</i><br>
: limit their choices, shouldn't we accept that modifying them is equally<br>
: permissible?<br>
