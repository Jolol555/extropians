Abstract
<br>
  Transbilayer movement of erythrocyte membrane cholesterol is impaired in
  patients affected with essential hypertension. This is an inherited disorder,
  but environmental factors are also involved. Dietary fats might play a role
  in the prevention and/or treatment of such abnormality in the kinetic pools
  of membrane cholesterol. We tested this hypothesis by using a diet (in which
  30% of the energy came from fat) rich in olive
  oil or in high-oleic sunflower oil (as
  natural sources of monounsaturated fatty acids, MUFAs) and determining their
  influence on the movement of cholesterol into the lipid bilayer of the
  erythrocyte membrane after a four-week period. We concluded that dietary
  olive oil is helpful in normalizing the
  impaired transbilayer movement of membrane cholesterol in erythrocytes of
  eight normocholesterolaemic and eight hypercholesterolaemic hypertensive
  patients. However, the effects cannot be attributed exclusively to the
  content of MUFAs (mainly oleic acid) in the diet, as high-oleic sunflower
  oil was unable to induce favourable changes.
