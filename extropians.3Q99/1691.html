You know, although I know there are subtle and important distinctions between 
the human hand and those of other primates, I've also come to wonder about 
the "opposable thumb breakthrough" meme.  As I write this, my lemur Darwin is 
sitting on my desk holding a pen with his hand and using it to scratch his 
ear.  As he does about one time in ten, he's got his thumb opposed to his 
fingers as he grasps the pen (I'm really not making this up, he's looking at 
me now, wondering why I'm grinning at him so much).<a name="1707qlink1">  A chimp will use her 
thumb in an opposed fashion almost as often as a human, from the observations 
</a>
I've made in zoos and on video.<a name="1699qlink1">  I agree that it's much more a function of 
the combination of BIPEDALISM with the wetware behind the hardware, than the 
hand alone.  The major breakthrough that happened with Australopithicus was 
freeing up the hand.  As you say, John,<a name="1700qlink1"> the big question in primate evolution 
</a>
is what pushed us upright.</a>

<p>
Looking forward to some bipedal, manual-to-manual interaction at EXTRO4 in a 
few hours . . .
