Is it just me, or does this sentence make no sense whatsoever? :)

<p>
A): CD-ROM's are purely optical, no "magento-" involved.

<p>
B): Apart from both involving matter and electricity being used in the storage
of data, this seems to have no resemblence to a CD ROM whatsoever.

<p>
CD-ROMS are pretty much *defined* as being optical (as opposed to electronic
"solid state") and moving (as opposed to "fixed"). When you remove those
characteristics you don't have much left of a CD-ROM. When you invoke "different
operating approach" you remove what little similarity is left.

<p>
They might just have well as said "The system is not dissimilar to a subway
train, except that it doesn't travel underground, does not have wheels, and you
can store hundreds of gigabytes of data on it."

<p>
Assuming it is legit, this is the worst example of distortion through
simplification of a concept I think I've ever seen.

<p>
All this, coupled with the claims about the significance of the device to the
future of the computing industry, should be setting off alarm bells.
