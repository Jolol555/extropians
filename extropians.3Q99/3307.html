The same things happen to me as well.  Of course I go to churches sometimes 
to bring out this effect.  What I then do is acknowledge what it is as just 
ignorance and the not wanting to know the truth for fear of loosing a 
comfortable position of belief.  I think bring up feelings of pity and 
associate that with the feelings and memories brought up by being at the 
church.  What happens more and more is when I go to a church or talk with a 
Christian who is trying to persuade me I just pity him the way he does me.  
Eventually that will be my only reaction.  Now you may bring up concerns 
about suppression and its effects on the subconscious but I take care of 
that too.  I re-associate my original thoughts with piety to my parents who 
didn't know any better.  It's not denial.  After all, they don't know any 
better. :-)

That would be harder to do ofcourse. What do you think?
