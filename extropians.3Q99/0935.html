<p>
I remember that when I first encountered the Extropian vision, there was very little
SF that had put it all together. Then there were a few books that explored nanotech (Greg Bear,
Michael Flynn), sort of by grafting it onto the present and letting some of the obvious
implications drive the plot. 

<p>
I am a few pages into Stephen Baxter's _Ring_ as I type, and it scores very high on Ex!meme
uptake. So far, by page 37, we've got transformation of a human into something more by
use of powerful nanobots, immortality conferred by anti-senescence treatments using nanites,
wormhole travel, time loops ...
