Jumping in in the middle here on only this one point (right . . .) . . .

<p>
Proposals to address this problem have been made.  The one I find most 
intriguing is the idea of various levels of rating agencies: There could be 
low-level, specialized rating agencies, and then an arbitrarily large 
hierarchy of agencies that rate agencies.  Different levels of consumer 
interest could be accommodated by subscription to whatever level of 
agency-rating best fits one's personal inclination.  Thus, you might well 
never check beyond a very high level of filtered rating for, say automobiles, 
while I would pour over reports and ratings from the lowest level.  When 
purchasing bioinformatic services, our use of rating agencies would likely be 
reversed.  Employing collaborative filtering, you might well be unkowingly 
guided by my analysis of automobiles and I might be guided by your analysis 
of biotechnology even though we never meet or communicate directly.
