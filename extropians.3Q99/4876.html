<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mike, this is Joe Dees.  I am more than willing to begin our dance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again if you once again begin to abuse this list as an NRA</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Propaganda tool.  Are you prepared for another 1200 email</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exchange, or are you willing to keep your fucking word and take</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this bullshit to the other list for which it was established and in</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which it belongs?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; When did I ever promise to not discuss the subject of violence on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; extropians list on a permanent basis?  I did not start this thread, I am</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; merely responding to unanswered allegations. I did start the exi-freedom</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; mail list in response to the one month of censoship on the extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; mail list. The person who was making the discussion previously</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; unbearable for a number of list members was you and your crass language</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; and rude personal attacks, as evidenced by your statement above.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I have said in the past, despite your lies about my position, that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; feel much as you, but I am not confident in placing in the government's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; hands the ability to determine a person's unfitness to carry if they are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; not a felon and are not protected by due process. You seem to have a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem with the NRA, not me, and are trying to paint me as the NRA's</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; shill, simply because you like to pick fights. It was you who was tossed</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; from the extropians list for disobeying the restrictions, not me. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; obeyed them and started my own list to function as a conduit of truth</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; during the interim period of censorship. I found that of the 15 people I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; personally asked to subscribe, almost all did, and we gained a number of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; others from a general invitation to the list. Since the end of the ban</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; period, traffic there has died down, but is not non-existent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mike Lorrey</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Good. then you can explain there whether or not you want</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; weapons kept out of the hands of those who have been duly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; certified as mentally deficient or disturbed, and in each case, why,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; as well as, if you don't trust your government, who else are you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; going to trust to keep weapons out of the hands of violent felons.</i><br>
<pre>
&gt; 
&gt; Again, a misrepresentation. And I don't need to go there, since the ban
&gt; on the word gun was over a month after it was instituted. It is also
&gt; clear that you have trouble with reading comprehension, as I clearly
&gt; stated above that it is the governments job to determine if a person is
&gt; a violent criminal. Stop lying.

<a name="4893qlink1">The ban is still in effect.  If you continue to violate it, I must insist 
</a>
that the proper penalties be enforced.  You are also being 
disingenuous, if not an outright liar, by saying that you are "not the 
NRA", when you are in fact a self-avowed member of the 
organization, and their most common publicity tactic is to get 
members to pose smiling in slig magazine layouts besides the 
<a name="4912qlink1">message "I'm the NRA."  You are only once again attempting to 
<a name="4924qlink1">infiltrate your propaganda here because it bores evangelists to 
preach to the choir.  Well, your NRA shill song-and-dance is not 
</a>
</a>
welcome here, so do most everyone else here a huge favor and can 
it forthwith, or do most everyone else here a huger favor and keep it 
up until you get your ass booted; it's all the same to me.
