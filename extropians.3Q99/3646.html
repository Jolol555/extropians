I anticipated this response.  The average extropian doesn't eat red meat and
likes to give literal answers to rhetorical questions.</a>

<p>
You only have to compare different systems in detail if you want to make an
informed decision.  Most people will buy some generic brand of protection,
law, meat inspection, et cetera, and market forces will see to it that they
receive the kind of product that (a) keeps them in a fit state to purchase
future products; and (b) keeps them happy to be in the consumer loop.

It's also not likely to happen before nanotechnology comes along and makes
it a whole new ball game.
