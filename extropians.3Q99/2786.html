<a href="2757.html#2786qlink1">&gt;Question: Can any neuroscience people comment on what would be involved in</a><br>
<i>&gt;wiring amputees to computers and allowing them to control virtual arms</i><br>
<i>&gt;and/or legs?  Would this be easier to do to an amputee than a non-amputee?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;BM</i><br>

<p>
Though not a neuroscientist, yet, I have given the consideration much 
thought.  The brain would probably still give the signal to move a leg even 
if the leg is no longer there.  If you could monitor the brain via a type of 
MRI helmet and recognize the signal to move the leg then you wouldn't even 
need wiring.  You just monitor the brain activity and with some very 
sophisticated software move the robotic joints and muscles.

<p>
I don't see why this wouldn't work.  But like I said I'm not a neurologist.  
I don't know the actual workings of the brain yet.  Just how I think it 
would work.
