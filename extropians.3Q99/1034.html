<p>
I'm still waiting to hear back from you on this subject.  You've been
posting to other subjects on the list (including the "boundaries of
appropriate skepticism/gullibility" topic that the Mars topic has turned
into), so I imagine that you are not backlogged or taking a break from
reading the list.

<p>
<a name="1035qlink1">Do you have a citation to support your assertion?</a>

<p>
Or shall I relegate it (based on the personal and admittedly judgmental
filters I have developed over the years regarding tax freedom and tax
protest arguments) to the category of "gullible hearsay"?  If so, I won't
be saying you're wrong -- just that (based on my experience with past tax
freedom claims) I choose not to assign any significant probability to the
likelihood that your claim is correct, until I am pointed to some
verifiable evidence of its correctness.</a>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would bet that most U.S. citizens would love it if it were true that only</i><br>
<i>&gt; those four classes of citizens were required to file income tax returns</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Absent a citation to support the assertion that this is actually the law of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the land, it seems like all you are doing is in fact, as the subject line</i><br>
<i>&gt; suggests, "Encouraging (Illegal) Tax Evasion."  The police power of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; United States is very real if they can get their hands on you.  People may</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to take the risk of reaping the benefits of successful tax evasion,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but the risks of criminal and civil punishment do exist.  And as both a</i><br>
<i>&gt; skeptic and a pessimist on the government's use of its coercive power, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt that the U.S. Government exempts everyone not in one of those four</i><br>
<i>&gt; classes from the federal income tax.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; But I'd be very happy to be proven wrong....</i><br>
