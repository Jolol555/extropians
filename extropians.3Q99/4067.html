  IAN: Ever notice how more victims come 
  forward to report crimes than perpetrators
  come forward to confess?! I'm not impressed
  that perpetrators of mass murder are inclined
  to rush forward to confess their crime, and 
  I expect the planners of such a crime are 
  also aware of the same. Perhaps one will 
  want to write a book and make a lot of 
  money so he can refurbish his prison cell,
  but I also think most people don't like jail.

<p>
  Also, the fact that an ex-CIA agent recently
  came forward to report that the Delta Force 
  was firing at Mt Carmel and he's now hiding 
  after death threats to himself and his son 
  gives us a little hint about the forces at 
  play that can help ensure silence. I'm not
  impressed that most people desire death 
  for themselves or their family members.

<a href="4003.html#4067qlink2">&gt;But, you still haven't addressed my fundamental points</a><br>
<i>&gt;  (1) Why would the government create a conspiricy</i><br>
<i>&gt;      involving dozens or hundreds of individuals</i><br>
<i>&gt;      to commit mass murder?</i><br>


<p>
  IAN: I've already given some answers to that.
  If we have videotape of someone committing a 
  crime, the question of why is academic. If
  we have video of Smith killing Jones, Smith 
  wont get off if a motive isn't established.

<p>
  As to your baseless assertion that the FLIR
  may be faked. The FLIR came from the FBI and 
  the FBI claims the flashes in question are 
  sunlight reflections. I'm not impressed that 
  the FBI would doctor the FLIR in such a way
  that frames themselves for mass murder since
  expert analysis confirms that they are not 
  sunlight reflections but gun-muzzle flashes.
  Here's another expert analysis of the flashes:

<p>
<a href="4003.html#4067qlink3">&gt;  (2) How would they hope to protect such an action</a><br>
<i>&gt;      from exposure?</i><br>

<p>
  IAN: Concealing and "losing" evidence and
  other things that they've done and are doing. 
  Is this really so difficult to figure out??? 
  I'm not impressed that crimes involving a 
  lot of people are impossible or that there's
  an overwhelming tendency for those involved
  in mass murder to rush forward to confess.
  But even if I was, the bottom line is the 
  facts in the case, since someone could 
  confess to a crime that wasn't committed.
