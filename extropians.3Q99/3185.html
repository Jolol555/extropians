<a name="3217qlink1"><a name="3190qlink1">I read Natasha's posting a moment ago with some sadness.  In the year that
I have been away, it seems that the seeds of division between extropians
and general transhumanists continue to be sown.</a>  Many of the persons on the
</a>
general transhumanist list also subscribe to this list, and have seen this
posting by now, calling for a defense against a perceived attack.

<p>
If someone decides to make a response to these particular individuals, I
hope that it will be a measured one.  The thread has just been posted, and
no one else on the transhumanist list has has much of a chance to respond
to it, or ignore it.

<p>
This seems to be an opportunity to increase understanding of the diversity
with Extropy Institute.  I for one would welcome a posting from a
<br>
'nonlibertarian' extropian explaining that this perception does not reflect<br>
reality, so long as it is respectful to the other list.
