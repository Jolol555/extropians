<a href="0727.html#0730qlink1">&gt;I've looked into the face on mars nonesense in detail over the years</a><br>
<i>&gt;(I was at Case For Mars II in '84 when Richard Hoagland was first</i><br>
<i>&gt;popularizing it).</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt;He's a crank.</i><br>

<p>
Agreed!  Why can't you understand that acknowledging that an enigma exists on 
Mars is not in any way buying into the theories of a single nut?

<p>
Hoagland has done a lot of damage of late.  When the AP ran a piece about the 
Mars face last year, who did they interview?  Hoagland, of course...  It's a 
self-defeating cycle that demands fresh thought.  Hoagland is but one voice 
among many.  Do yourself a favor and listen to some of the others.

<p>
(Can anyone honestly pretend that a subject as potentially explosive as 
possible ET artifacts wouldn't attract crazies?  It comes with the territory.)
