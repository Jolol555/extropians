<i>&gt; most of the energy the star generates.  At the Extro4 conference,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anders indicated that he has an updated version of his J-Brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; paper that adds some additional classifications &amp; structures for</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2071qlink2">The only reason I can think of would be that they don't care - you
build computing structures out of all the available matter, and the
energy requirements tturn out to be less than the entire stellar
output. Might happen if people settle for my 'Zeus' model of
megastructures (cold diamondoid planet-sized system), but I better do
some calculations on how to maximize the information
content/production in the entire system.</a>

<a href="2048.html#2051qlink2">&gt; During a coffee break, I overheard two young scientists from NASA Ames &amp;</a><br>
<i>&gt; The SETI Inst. discussing "I don't understand the comment about dismantling</i><br>
</a>
<i>&gt; Mercury...".  So I stopped and did a brief explanation about molecular</i><br>
<i>&gt; disassembly, exponetial growth, etc.  When I got through, they had no</i><br>
<i>&gt; "scientific" objections as far as I could determine.  At least one however</i><br>
<a name="2060qlink3"><i>&gt; seemed very concerned that the astrologers would never allow me to</i><br>
<i>&gt; dismantle Mercury since it would cause a signficant amount of disruption</i><br>

<a name="2071qlink3">Hurray! Hmm, maybe we should as posthumans just rearrange the solar
system to "improve" on astrology?</a> :-)
