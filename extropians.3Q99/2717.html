If you check out the work of the Domans - Robert and his clan in Utah at the 
National Academy for Child Development and his brother Glenn in Pennsylvania 
at what used to known as the Better Baby Institute, you will find that in 
fact a lot of kids with severe brain damage have come out of their 
procedures with Mensa level IQs.  Of course, the normal or above normal 
(genetically) kids do proportionally better.  However, a caveat: The same 
techniques do'nt work for everyone the same way.  People have very different 
learning styles, which appear to be virtually hardwired - maybe largely 
genetic, but we don't know.  The mind builds itself from replicable feedback 
loops, starting in the womb fairly early on - bringing thumb and index 
finger together reliably, for example.

<p>
What is bothersome is this Mensa/Burt/educational aristocracy garbage, as in 
Natasha's response to "we only use a fraction of our brains."  Her claim 
that we use all our brains all the time is equally misleading at the least.  
In fact, the best hardware can't make up for lousy software, garbage OS, 
faulty I/O, etc., and with very young children we're even talking microcode 
level.

<p>
Just think what the world today would be like if all those proto-extropians 
and radical libertarians from the '60's had raised genius kids.  Even one 
Einstein can change the world.  Imagine 500 at once.  The data was there in 
the '60's to know that it was possible.  I read J.S. Mill's autobio in about 
'67, and Ayn Rand's articles on Montessori shortly later.  Unfortunately - 
I'm just getting into Ettinger - it appears that he was not well-informed on 
this issue, and his influence on futurism can hardly be overestimated.

<p>
BTW, the reason they don't prosecute homeschoolers any more?  A major 
federal study showed that homeschooled kids also maintained an average 3 
year academic lead over the public-schooled kids, even with all the 
nut-cases among the home-schoolers.  This killed the prima facia argument 
that the prosecuting attorney used to walk into court with, "your honor, 
these people are not state-certified teachers.  Therefore they are guilty of 
child-neglect, since they cannot claim to be offering a normal learning 
environment."  OOops...  Out the window after the federal study was 
published in the mid-80's...  Occasionally even the feds do something right. 
  ;)

<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;is.</i><br>
<i>&gt;There is a case of a young girl who has had half her brain removed, who is</i><br>
<i>&gt;amazingly close to being normal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Given that the human brain is capable of such amazing things, I find it </i><br>
<i>&gt;absurd</i><br>

<i>&gt;And I</i><br>
<i>&gt;fully believe that despite the profound differences between us all, that </i><br>
<i>&gt;the</i><br>
<i>&gt;reason for profound stupidity is the educational system.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In my opinion, the educational system is hell bent on stamping out </i><br>
<i>&gt;individual</i><br>
<i>&gt;differences. But we are individuals, and the only way for people to make </i><br>
<i>&gt;the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;of their brains, is by pursuing their own interests, and finding our own </i><br>
<i>&gt;way of</i><br>
<i>&gt;learning.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The people on this list, probably do have better genes than most people.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;But I</i><br>
<i>&gt;bet that most of us snuck out and read books, when we were suppose to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;engaging</i><br>
<i>&gt;in structured activities. We left the herd and learned to think for </i><br>
<i>&gt;ourselves.</i><br>
