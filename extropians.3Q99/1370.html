<a href="1084.html#1370qlink1">(just) a single, "instantaneous" procedure that would transfer</a><br>
one's thought into a computer. I'm strongly in favor of the gradual
approach, as opposed to the scanning method where
essentially a "copy" is being uploaded.

<p>
<a name="1373qlink1">*Say that there are two "copies" of an original person uploaded. There are
two persons with the same uploaded (or downloaded) data, consisting of one
originals information, what is the perspective of the consciousness?</a>
<a name="1373qlink2">Are these to copies from two different viewpoints experiencing the same
<a name="1373qlink3">consciousness?</a> See I was having a conversation with someone and we were
discussing consciousness.</a> He was stating that a
conscious is not tangable enough to be transferred into information to be
dowloaded.<a name="1372qlink1"> I told him that the real question is "what is the definition of
<a name="1417qlink1"><a name="1379qlink1">consciousness", until that is clear this kind of question is limited in
answer. Any idea's?</a></a></a>
