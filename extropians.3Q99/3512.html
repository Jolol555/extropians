No need to justify it, because the justification would only bore listeners
that much more, and they'll tune out your message. Even the best ideas have
to avoid boredom. Read, for example, the brief history of fatbrain.com.

that

Trying to prove that you enjoy life for itself takes the fun out of it,

I'll drink to that.
