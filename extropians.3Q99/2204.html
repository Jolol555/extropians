If a practical quantum is ever built PGP is dead, just making the key larger is
a lousing proposition, you'll never keep up. When a conventional 64 bit single
processor computer performs an operation, it does it on one 64 bit number at
a time. When a 64 bit (actually a 64 qubit) single processor quantum computer
performs an operation, it does it on all 64 bit numbers at the same time,
all 2^64 of them, more than a billion billion, and any increase in the number of
qubits the computer can handle will increase it's already astronomical power
exponentially.

<p>
However you could still communicate privately if you used quantum cryptography.
I written a post on quantum cryptography before, if anybody's interested I'll try to
dig it out and re-send it.

Hal said that a working quantum computer would not prove that the many world
interpretation is correct and he's right, but it would make it much more popular.
You'd have to understand such a beast pretty well to program it and the
many world way would probably be the clearest way to think about it.
