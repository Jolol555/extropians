Damien Broderick &lt;d.broderick@english.unimelb.edu.au&gt; asked
&gt; Could you explain this a bit? (`Liberal' in Australian terms is, of
&gt; course, a historical misnomer for the Tory party equivalent.)

<p>
Butting in ... there is no Tory party and certainly no republican party in
Australia. Our debates about welfare are all far to the "left" of those
which characterised 18th Century Britain or the 20th Century United States
of America.

<p>
In Australia, both parties are debating how much to censor, eavesdrop,
regulate, and restrict the net, and all forms of media. In NSW, carrying a
pair of scissors in your pocket is an offence with a maximum 14 year jail
term. This is a million light years away from Jefferson's republic.

best wishes,

"There is not a truth existing which I fear, or would wish unknown to the
whole world."


<p>
      Thomas JEFFERSON



<p>
"The only freedom which counts is the freedom to do what some other people
think to be wrong. There is no point in demanding freedom to
do that which all will applaud. All the so-called liberties or rights are
things which have to be asserted against others who claim that if
such things are to be allowed their own rights are infringed or their own
liberties threatened. This is always true, even when we speak of
the freedom to worship, of the right of free speech or association, or of
public assembly. If we are to allow freedoms at all there will
constantly be complaints that either the liberty itself or the way in which
it is exercised is being abused, and, if it is a genuine freedom,
these complaints will often be justified. There is no way of having a free
society in which there is not abuse. Abuse is the very hallmark
of liberty."


<p>
         Lord Hailsham, c. 1965.
