Well, there *is* something like that available, though not in realtime
(yet?). On the new GerOL page (yes, I know, I keep going on and on about
it), the reviews of journal articles are a) written in a language as close
to standard English as I could make them without being unwieldy and b) are
full of links to a dictionary site that pops up in a separate window. My
theory is that barrier #1 to understanding what the scientists are talking
about is jargon. When you read a review on GerOL, you not only get the
point that the article was trying to make, but you also come away with an
expanded technical vocabulary that will make it easier for your to get
through future articles.

By the way, the site has been upgraded to a newer version of Slash. This
means you can now create a user account there, change how the site looks
to you from your browser, and post comments either as yourself or
anonymously.

<p>
Speaking of comments, I'm hoping to see more people posting comments on
that site. Of all things, Slashdot certainly has the qualities of a
self-organizing project. However, the initial conditions need to be right,
and I want the readers to get into the habit of participating from the
start. So in the early days, moderator points will be very easy to obtain.
If you know of an aging-related site, news event, organization,
whatever-- post it using the "Submit Story" button.
