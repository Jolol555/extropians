I disagree here. If I become angry and break things or people, then my
actions are irrational (since they are not in my best interest) and
undesirable - here some rational control obviously is
desirable. Sometimes emotions suggest actions that are bad for us.

<p>
<a name="0159qlink1">What is needed is to balance the emotions, which provide us with
motivation and creates a mode of thinking, with rational evaluation of
situations. Just like we need to learn how to learn, think rationally
and act, we need to learn how to manage our emotions. They work great
in certain respects, but not all.</a>

<p>
I certainly agree here. I'm quite glad my brain biochemistry and
cognitive structures make me feel this way most of the time, it has
helped me tremendously and I have seen people destroy their lives just
by being negative towards themselves and everything else. The problem
is of course creating a stable (but not inflexible) good mood; drugs
might help, but positive thinking and self-insight work even better -
but they are hard to apply for negative people.
