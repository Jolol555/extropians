Sigh!  This is what happens when you let a wet-matter biologist
comment on computer architectures.  Luck's concept of computer
architectures died 5-10 years ago.

<p>
No discussion of Symmetric Multiprocessors (SMP) that have simultaneous
access to memory!  No discussion of processors with multiple "execution
units" doing instructions simultaneously!  No discussion of SIMD
(Single Instruction Multiple Data) or MIMD (Multiple Instruction Multiple
Data) architectures processing data streams simultaneously!  No discussion
of architectures like the TERA that simultaneously stream dozens of
data elements in and out of memory and can do a context switch on each
instruction to operate on the data that happens to be available.

<p>
Good thing his email address isn't included.   Hrummphhh!

<p>
Most importantly, all this work says is that there is serial consideration
of items in the visual field as subjects for limited analysis operation.
It would seem to be the analysis operation (something that requires a
yes/no decision by the conscious mind) that is the hurdle.  Unfortunately,
it only pays lip service to a few of the many things the brain *can* do
simultaneously.
