My $.02 on this topic: I think it is very important to do what Kathryn is 
talking about here, not in any sort of "PC" or "quota" way, by any means, but 
to be as open and encouraging to as many different types of people as we can 
be and remain true to our core ideals and values.  Yes, many of those core 
ideas were originally conceived in a largely (but not entirely) 
white/American/male environment, and yes those originators were largely (but 
not entirely) scientific and engineering "types", but this isn't the 
environment that will ultimately make important judgments about the 
transhumanist agenda and extropian values.<a name="3016qlink1">  As one perhaps very important 
example, consider Robert Bradbury's recent observation that the developing 
world may welcome advanced genetic agricultural technology more than the 
"first world".  Likewise, Natasha</a> More has made the good point that artists, 
<a name="3016qlink2">in our time as a group more oriented to the imagination and creative new 
approaches than the average person, may present more fertile ground for 
widespread acceptance of our ideas than many other influential segments of 
the population, presenting a high-value cultural "leverage point" for 
pressing ahead with our agenda of augmenting the human animal.</a>

<p>
It isn't hard for me to imagine the crucial next two decades as potentially 
very turbulent times.  We will need more widespread acceptance of our ideas 
and values to successfully navigate this period.  Diplomatically reaching out 
to new people is simple common sense.
