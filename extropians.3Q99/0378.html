I went to Target (<a href="http://shop.target.com">http://shop.target.com</a>) and purchased a Wham-O 
<br>
("Since 1948") Superball(R) for $1.95.<br>

<p>
Then I went to Home Depot (<a href="http://www.homedepot.com/">http://www.homedepot.com/</a>) and picked up a 
16" acrylic globe from the lighting section.

<p>
Holding the Globe, I spin the Superball around as fast as I can.  
Eventually, I learn to put a slight spin on the Globe so the ball 
creates a little friction and starts to gather static electricity.

<p>
When I do this while smoking pot, I spend hours happily pacified 
while letting the balls vibrations color my mental states.  
<br>
(Interestingly, the static charge comes back to me during daily <br>
activities, like Casper the Friendly Ghost, to sort of steer me 
around while I'm making decisions and navigating my daily maze.)

<p>
See <a href="http://www.ifeden.com/brandX/common-livestock/">http://www.ifeden.com/brandX/common-livestock/</a> for a picture of 
Casper.  Don't mind the glamour shots of my gigolo brother, Dave.

<p>
I'm not sure if the superball is as efficient as the Chinese medicine 
balls with the springs and ringers inside, but it seems like an easy 
way to collect electricity from microscale muscle twitches: burning 
oil not as in a conventional gas generator, but instead as the slow 
decrease in mass of the superball.

<p>
It makes a little buzzing noise, like an Engine.  Good tie-in for a 
10 year old book, as yet unintroduced to many a layperson!

<p>
How about legalizing drug shakes, and turning them into a power 
source?  Allow the masses to consume whatever they want!  Tell all 
the drug dealers, "O.K. Have it your way.  The cryonicists are ready, 
incase you overdose.  Be careful and have fun!"

<p>
Also see "Left Nut" under <a href="http://www.ifeden.com/brandX/misc/bowls/">http://www.ifeden.com/brandX/misc/bowls/</a> 
for an update on JFK's legacy.
