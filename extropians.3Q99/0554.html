<a name="0610qlink1">They also have the computational capacity to simulate a variety
of possible futures for any human situation and would likely be
able to predict exactly how things will play out (within the limits
of chaos theory).

<p>
I was under the impression that chaos theory no more than acknowledged that
there are some systems which have so many variables of such complexity that
we cannot hope to predict them with current technology, e.g. the weather.
But this does not mean that there are systems so complex that even the most
advanced SI in the whole of eternity cannot track the variables. What I am
saying is that I dont think there's an unmovable upper limit to the chaos
that can be tracked. So sufficiently advanced SI's could predict future
states of systems with 100% accuracy no problem, surely.</a>
