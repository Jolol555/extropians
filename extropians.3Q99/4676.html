From: Michael S. Lorrey &lt;retroman@turbont.net&gt;
<br>
<a href="4656.html#4676qlink1">&gt;From my experience it has little to do with being hungry. Its a matter</a><br>
<i>&gt;of working the brain in its natural environment, giving it a complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;problem of tracking and stalking another creature that has been evolved</i><br>
<i>&gt;to avoid your best efforts. Making the kill at that point may or may not</i><br>
<i>&gt;be necessary. A centralized agricultural society may have been developed</i><br>
<i>&gt;to work in such a way as to allow a hunting recreation, but industrial</i><br>
<i>&gt;society is not built for man or to permit him to fulfill his need for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the hunt, as illustrated by the prevalence of serial killers in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;urban environment, etc., much of it tries to force man into the most</i><br>
<i>&gt;economically efficient box.</i><br>

<p>
This parallels my experience as well. Successful hunters generally express
themselves in less confrontational and/or antisocial ways than do ideologues
who want to deny the importance of sociobiology in human life. Furthermore,
socialists theorize and hypothesize thousands of hours for every minute they
spend actually experimenting and observing the effects of hunting on real
people. Speculating right back at them, I wonder how many millions of humans
Stalin might not have murdered if he had gone hunting once in a while.
&lt;brb, I gotta go shoot the neighbor's cat&gt;
