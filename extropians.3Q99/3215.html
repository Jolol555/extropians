<a href="3140.html#3215qlink2">&gt;Anders may want to comment further on this.  My basic position</a><br>
<i>&gt;is that connections formed in early childhood are very difficult</i><br>
<i>&gt;to rid yourself of.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3265qlink1">It is true that memories and their associations from a very young age are 
deeply rooted and would require a lot of reassociations but its not 
impossible.  If I would get a blow to the head now I doubt I would resort to 
the thinking process I had when I was 9.  Instead what would happen is that 
I couldn't perform as well as I use too because some function(s) may</a> be 
damaged.

<p>
<a name="3265qlink2">This overlap reality you talk about can't exist.  Or if it can please 
explain to me how.  For my model says that memories connect with other 
memories.  An over lapping model would have a set of memories at one layer 
and another set of memories at another layer and would connect by vary</a> few 
associations.

<p>
Because new associations are made and stregnthened every time that part of 
memory is referenced it makes it more likely for that out part of memory to 
be referenced within a time frame.<a name="3265qlink3">  To reprogram yourself all you have to do 
is remember your associations-physical memories, ideas, thoughts, reflexes, 
etc..., and then bring up other memories-physical, ideas, thoughts, 
reflexes, etc...associate those with the other memories in a way that would 
give a desired output.</a>
<br>
Of course this takes a lot of planning.  You decide what you want to be 
like, compare 'you' now with the future 'you' and viola, new associations.  
You do this over and over again with many different patterns of association 
and what will happen is that there will be more stronger links to each part 
of the memories that you excersice.
<br>
My unfinished post last Sunday on "Creating a Thought" explains this.

understand the concepts of neuroscience.</a>
