<a name="3414qlink1">The average ignorant abused white trash god fearing</a> fucked up little 
kid has no concept of nanotechnology-based surveillance, command and 
control systems with direct access to their brains.  In other words, 
the Lord God Almighty.

<p>
You could alert the media to downplay god and hype athiesm and still 
the little rug rats will have no concept of math, physics, 
psychology, history, social responsibility and consequences of their 
actions: too complex for simple minds.  Solution: little white lies 
with a wink and a smile - same terminology, different technical 
details and schematics.  Keep the armies of cannon fodder and 
industrial labor as harmless as possible.

<p>
It's a question of crowd control.  Humans are self-replicating 
weapons.  They need to be tracked, spellbound and intellectually 
neutered, for the safety of the herd and success of the national 
football league and world wrestling federation.  Voters easily swayed 
with the theatrics and make believe battles between equally ignorant 
political parties.  IN GOD WE TRUST.  Place your left hand on the 
Bible and raise your right hand on your heart I pledge allegience to 
the flag...one nation, under god, with liberty and justice for all.

<p>
When the monitors deploy it makes a little gurgling noise as the 
lasers perform neurotomies and the new digitally switched nerve 
interconnections (with cancellation and bypass circuitry) are 
assembled into place.

<p>
It could be done in their sleep, but that makes it hard to ferret out 
the subtle control networks associated with consciousness: better to 
do it while they're awake.  Maybe under cover of New Year's Eve party 
noise and drunken festivities.  On behalf of the Borg, welcome to 
Pleasantville, uh, erh, salvation, or heaven.  Judgement day is upon 
us, and you've been saved, no go home and O.D. so we can get you 
suspended before destroying your frozen remains in Merkles scanning 
and replicating procedure.  Wait a minute: it's absurd!  Life is 
meaningless, death is nothing to fear.

<p>
<a name="3414qlink2">Then again, for the emotional catharsis of meek</a> athiests who inherit 
the earth, maybe some eternal suffering (~20 billion years) for the 
Christians.  And then time stood still: a single second felt like a 
day: 4 dimensional freeze frame, feelings included.  And that 
precious frozen moment: an ecstatic orgasm, a wonderful breathtaking 
vista of a mountain, lake, stream, field of flowers.  No, it's that 
moment in front of the tv, watching Al Gore or George Bush with his 
left hand on the bible, being sworn in to office, you're holding the 
phone, you just learned that your whole family's been murdered by a 
disgruntled Jesus wannabee.  20 billion years of that moment.
