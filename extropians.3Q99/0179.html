	You're not confusing this with <a href="http://www.seti.com">http://www.seti.com</a> , do you?

Eugene, I clicked on this link at work! For everyone's information who is as
naive as I was, the above link leads to a site about Sex with Extra
Terrestrial Intelligences. Funny (and fairly well done), but doesn't look
good for you if your internet connection is monitored.

<p>
That blocking legislation here musn't have come into effect yet.

<p>
Also a little cautionary note about Gina's chat site (I will get to a chat
soon, I promise) - it didn't work for me because it is blocked by our
firewall. About a minute after I clicked on the link, I received a call from
our systems people asking me why I was trying to get through the firewall
(why can't systems support people learn to trust software developers? "Don't
worry, I'll respect your systems in the morning").

<p>
