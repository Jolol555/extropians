Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVE--To determine the association of baseline
  cardiorespiratory fitness to all-cause mortality across the
  range of blood glucose levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Data from a
  prospective study of 8715 men (average age 42 yr), followed for an average of
  8.2 yr (range 1-15 yr), were analyzed. Cardiorespiratory
  fitness was assessed by maximal-exercise treadmill testing. Men with evidence
  of clinical vascular disease or who did not achieve 85% of their
  age-predicted maximum heart rate during exercise testing were excluded from
  analyses. RESULTS--Age-adjusted death rates increased with higher levels, of
  fasting blood glucose. Regardless of glycemic status, fit
  men had lower age-adjusted all-cause death rates than their less fit
  counterparts. For men with fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 7.8
  mM or physician-diagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM),
  the age-adjusted death rates per 10,000 person-yr of follow-up in unfit and
  fit subjects were 82.5 and 45.9, respectively. The age-adjusted relative risk
  of death due to all causes was significantly elevated in the lower-fitness
  group within each of three glycemic status levels: fasting
  blood glucose less than 6.4 mM; relative risk (RR) = 1.93 (95% confidence
  interval [95% CI] 1.15-3.26); fasting blood glucose 6.4-7.8 mM; RR = 3.42
  (95% CI 2.27-5.15); and fasting blood glucose greater than or equal to 7.8 mM
  or with NIDDM, RR = 1.80 (95% CI = 1.25-2.58). Multivariate analyses,
  controlling for risk factors of mortality (age, resting systolic blood
  pressure, serum cholesterol, body mass index, family history of heart
  disease, follow-up interval, and smoking habit) showed a higher risk of death
  due to all causes for unfit compared with fit men. Multivariate risks of
  death associated with low fitness, compared with higher
  fitness (RR), in the three glycemic status groups were:
  fasting blood glucose less than 6.4 mM, RR = 1.38 (95% CI 1.09-1.74); fasting
  blood glucose 6.4-7.8 mM, RR = 1.61 (95% CI 0.91-2.86); and fasting blood
  glucose greater than or equal to 7.8 mM or with NIDDM, RR = 1.92 (95% CI
  0.75-4.90).
