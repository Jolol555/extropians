I think this was covered in a book written by Russ Funk, who founded Men
Against Rape.  As I recall it covers the medical facts for both genders.
Unfortunately, it seems to have walked out of my bookcase, someone must
have needed it.  I can't remember the title offhand.

At any rate, many doctors have testified about this at rape trials, because
it used to be a common defense that the victim either 'asked for it' or
'enjoyed it.'
<br>
A knowledge of the body's reactions under extreme duress helps the jury
sort through the testimony of both parties.
