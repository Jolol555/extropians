<p>
But the same can be said about any phenomena.  Why did my shoelaces become
untied?  Why does it happen so often to so many others?  Well, perhaps a
team of scientists studying it around the clock will discover why and

develop a means to prevent.

<a name="0146qlink1">But the same can be said about any paranormal phenomena or even stuff we are
pretty sure is outright bull.  I mean, perhaps Jesus was resurrected using

Perhaps the apparitions of the Virgin seen in so many places is actually

nanotech in action.  This really doesn't clear things up.

<i>&gt;One 'transhuman possibillity', put forward by John Keel and others, are</i><br>

<p>
It's also the plot for some science fiction novels, such as Ian Watson's
_Miracle Visitors_...  It makes for interesting science fiction, but I don't
think it's so.  But if it is, Have pity on me Oh Great Ones!  Take me into
</a>
your paradisical future!:)

<p>
<a name="0145qlink6">But in truth, I think people experience lots of things that have more
mundane explanations BUT would be much more interesting if cloaked in
</a>mystery.<a name="0145qlink7">  Each age and culture has its own way of dealing with this.  If the
"ghost rockets" (and this is the first I've heard of them) had been seen 30
years earlier, they might have been called "phanton airships" or 300 years
earlier "witches" or 3000 years earlier....</a>  Well, you get the point.
<a name="0145qlink8">That's a lot of testing.  That power must be very inefficient or sloppy</a> or,
<a name="0145qlink9">hard to believe, stupid.</a>

<p>
<a name="0145qlink10">I do find these things interesting and the speculations are also so, but I
have a feeling all this cool tech won't come about until we make it come
about.</a>

Cheers!
