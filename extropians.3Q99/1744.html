<a name="1749qlink2">Astrology only influences our choices as much as we beleive them to have
an influence. Its very much a self fulfilling prophesy, a bit, or whole
lot, of placebo effect. The evidence that the stock market can be
roughly predicted by astrology only illustrates how many traders are
making their trading decisions according to their horoscope. They and
others like them fulfill their own prophesies by creating trends of
speculation. I'll bet if the rules of astrological prediction were
suddenly changed that the market behaviro would change as well.
