I ran into some of the gang at the grocery store (hey, Mojave is a
*small* town), and the word is, another tiedown test after the 4th
of July, and first hover a week or two after that.  Wednesdays seem
to work out best- prep Monday, fuel up Tuesday, fire/fly Wednesday
dawn, analyze results &amp; make changes the rest of the week.

Actually, 9000 m/s is *not* a modest delta-V.  The effective mass
ratio must be in excess of 15, closer to 20 for pressure fed with
it's performance penalties.  Sometimes I wish we were Martians...

Spoken like a true Sea Dragon disciple ;) Little parts are a
nuisance to spec and manufacture, and tolerances have to be very
tight for injector elements... but I know from personal experience
that small combustors are convenient to handle.  It's nice to just
sling a 5,000 lbf thruster over your shoulder and carry it out to
the car.  500K engines need a forklift.  A large one.

<p>
What I'm getting at is that I'm an agnostic on pumped SSTO vs
press-fed TSTO.

Preaching to the choir.  BTDT.

<i>&gt; 2,000 volunteers.</i><br>

<p>
Actually, the handling characteristics of the Me-163 were quite
good, and the thrust/weight ratio is comparable to modern jet
fighters. Empty, the approach speed would be quite low.  There was a
two-seat trainer with retractable gear built during the war, and
that's the logical choice for a replica.  I wouldn't mind getting a
type rating for "rocket fighter"...
