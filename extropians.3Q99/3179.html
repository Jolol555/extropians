<a href="3132.html#3179qlink1"> &gt; "We uphold the free search for truth.  We will not be bound by a statement</a><br>
<i> &gt; of belief.  We do not ask anyone to subscribe to a creed."</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; "Human understanding of life and death, the world and its mysteries, is</i><br>
<i> &gt; never final."</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<i> &gt; So, it seems that not all religious people are ignoramuses after all.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3218qlink1">I am told by a Unitarian friend that Unitarians have the highest average
household incomes, $100,000K+.  Episcopalians come in second.</a>

<p>
The Episcopalians, the church in which I was raised, hold as the three
pillers of belief, "Faith, the Bible, and man's reason."  They use the third
pretty liberally to interpret the other two.  They allow abortion,
pre-marital sex, and for women and gays to be priests.

<p>
I went to a Catholic service with a friend and was astounded to discover
that they had the same liturgy - except there were all of these bits added
about how man is an unworthy sinner.  They just never mentioned that at my
church.<a name="3218qlink2">  The only time anyone mentioned Satan was a song for children that
had the line "And if the devil doesn't like it, he can sit on a tack."</a>

<p>
My deeply religious Episcopalian/Methodist father was genuinely shocked when
he met a Creationist.  He couldn't believe that anyone, particularly an
educated person such as this one, could believe such a thing.

<p>
I like to go to church once in a while because the liturgy is poetic, the
hymns are lovely, and the women wear hats.
