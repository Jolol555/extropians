John, after thinking this over I want to retract my earlier comments.
I now reject my earlier theory that the internet offers the opportunity
to turn off the internal censors.  To a certain extent this might be true,
however I see why one could fear rejection in cyberspace etc.

<p>
Heres a new notion: look for those on the internet who might go for
the honest kind-hearted underdog.  Be yourself John!  You're a good
guy.  {8-]

The example you gave of not having a drivers license: look at it this
way.  Our society has painted itself into a corner because everybody
has cars and drivers licenses, have we not?  We spread out all over
hell and gone, then we hafta drive drive drive, every day, spend
buttloads of money on insurance, highway systems, etc, we cant
change the system, and waste countless hours in traffic.

<p>
Think if we had current technology but decided to do without cars.
We could build some reaaaally cool cities: moving sidewalks, telecommuting,
lotsa cool stuff.  Be yourself John.  spike
