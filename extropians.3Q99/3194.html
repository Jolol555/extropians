The question is Eliezer, do you have any mountains where you live?
Maybe even the Pacific ocean?

<p>
If not, I think you be unexposed to the key things you may need
to bridge the gap between you and those of us who think this is
survivable.

<p>
I don't want to "sip" from a tidal wave, I want to *drive* it.
Failing that, then I'd at least hope to ride it.

<p>
Humans deal all the time with things that are *bigger* then they
are (re: climbing mountians, crossing oceans, etc.).  Sometimes
we succeed and sometimes we don't.  On a clear day I can see
Mt. Ranier, its a think of majestic beauty and awe.  Its something
I could climb with some inherent risk level above that which
I normally prefer.  It is also something that could easily destroy
me.  The trick is for me to be clever enough to know how to adapt
-- whether by fleeing if the mountian suddenly starts smoking, or
climbing it if the ice caps melt [yes, I know that it isn't much
of a threat, but it makes the story better].

<a name="3199qlink1">It isn't going to happen tomorrow.  And if we don't have the
designs pre-done (which seems very doubtful unless we get
self-evolving AI that understands mechanical engineering),
then even when the technology becomes available we are still
going to have perhaps more time to adapt than I might have
if Mt. Ranier suddenly did a Mt. St. Helens.</a>

<p>
And I for one object to being resembled to a naive technophile.
Now, the people using the BeOS, *they* clearly belong in
the technophile catagory... :-)
