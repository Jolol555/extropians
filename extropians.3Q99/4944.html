<a href="4938.html#4944qlink1">&gt; Aren't you an NRA member, too?</a><br>

<p>
I am not now nor have I ever been a member of the NRA, nor
have I ever owned a gun of any kind.  I once shot a .22 rifle
at summer camp, and I did some plinking with my Grandfather's
pistol on his farm, as did most boys my age growing up in the
rural South.  Neither of my parents were members, nor my
paternal grandparents, by I think my other grandpa (who was
also my great uncle--long story:) was.  He was in the Navy,
stationed at Pearl Harbor the day it was bombed.  He kept his
weapons from the war in a display case, and was an avid hunter
and target shooter who tried in vain to interest his grandson
who was more into playing checkers and dominoes.

<p>
Of course, none of that has anything to do with the value
of one's arguments or contribution to a discussion group, but
I am not the least surprized that you think it does.  Nor am
I surprized that you would quote an entire page-long posting
to add nothing but a 1-line baseless accusation.  You might at
least try to make your rants entertaining.
