Dear Jason,

<p>
Your imagination has run away with you. It sounds like
you've also hallucinated. My guess is that you've marinated
your brain in every techno-escapist vision the 1990s has
to offer, and it's just too unbearable to think that you
have all that in your head but that you remain just another
fragile, mortal, cosmically minute Earth biped, so you
turned a very elaborate daydream into your personal reality.

<p>
Get well soon,
<br>
Mitch
