The types of surface waves on liquids are not named after where the
energy comes from, but after where the restoring force comes from.
There are two extreme types:

<p>
  Gravity waves (restoring force: gravity) in the limit of long
    wavelength
<br>
  Ripples (restoring force: surface tension) in the limit of short
    wavelength

<p>
For intermediate wavelengths both effects are important.

<p>
Neither of the above is the same as a gravitational wave, which is the
(so far undetected) oscillatory form of the gravitational field.
