Also, let's recall that there are degrees of libertarianism. A lot of the early members
of this list were anarcho-capitalists -- very articulate ones. There was also a strong
bias against debating the basics, so libertarianism became EC (Extropically Correct) and
we largely moved on to other things. We probably all agree on a lot of positions
characteristic of more mainstream libertarian thought.

<p>
I don't share your sanguine hopes for a "rigorous theory of political
organization" based on the what I know of the genre. 

<p>
My challenge to anyone who wants to have a state-based politics consistent with 
spontaneous order and maximum expansion is to define a theory more optimal than that
summarized in _The Machinery of Freedom_.

<a name="3535qlink1">To minarchists, the main challenge is to define how to contain government.</a>

<p>
"Starting with a Constitution and Bill of Rights that reserved to the people all powers
not specifically granted to the government, it took less than 150 years to develop a Supreme
Court willing to rule that growing food on your own land to feed to your own hogs was
interstate commerce and could be regulated by the USDA." -- David D. Friedman, quoted
from memory, hopefully not too badly.

<p>
<a name="3535qlink2">To libertarians in general, of course, the main challenge is how to get there from here.</a>
