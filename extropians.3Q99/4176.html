Since the Governor has ordered those areas evacuated, we can naturally
presume that people are heeding the civil order.  Several decades ago,
before weather satellites, and earlier, when aircraft and automobiles
were less common, the death toll from huricanes was much higher because
people did not have as much warning nor as much data on the strength and
path of the storms as we do today.  In 1937 or thereabouts some 1300 died
when a hurricane hit Long Island without much warning.  Even today there
is much uncertainty in predicting 12 or 24 hours in advance exactly where
the storm will hit, so if it's better to be safe than sorry, people
should, if possible, evacuate any and all areas where conditions might
become dangerous.

If the roads are clogged, I would say it shows that not enough people
left early enough.
