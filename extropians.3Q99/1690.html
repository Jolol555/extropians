<a href="1687.html#1690qlink1">&gt; Actually, from what I've read, Einstein came up with the General Theory</a><br>
<i>&gt; of Relativity completely out of the blue, based on no experimental</i><br>
<i>&gt; evidence whatsoever.  I find this to be the single most impressive</i><br>
<i>&gt; mental feat of all time.</i><br>

<p>
If it were true it would be odd, but it isn't.

<p>
Einstein came up with the (1905) The Theory of Special Relativity first,
followed by the (1915) General Theory of Relativity, so for a start he had a
decade of knowledge and data to build on.

<p>
If you meant the Special Theory, it still is not the case. He knew that c=c
in any reference frame.

<p>
Unlike all previous workers, he took that fact seriously. As soon as take
that fact seriously, you can derive the entire TOSR. Einstein did this by
imagining travelling on a photon, holding c constant in other (now rapidly
translating) reference frames. This immediately gives us time dilation.
That, perforce, gives us mass and length dilation (if an object with a given
velocity translates at a different rate, its length has changed. If with a
given energy input it accelerates more slowly, then its mass has changed).
That is the whole theory.
