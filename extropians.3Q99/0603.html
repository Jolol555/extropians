Not enough money?

<p>
Spare time to burn?

<p>
Want to earn TOP DOLLAR without the trouble of actual WORK?

<p>
Read on below to discover the new way that YOU can EARN, without even
trying. THIS IS NOT ONE OF THOSE SHONKY COMMISSION JOBS, which promise the
earth, but deliver very little. 

<p>
THIS IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY WHICH YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS!!!

<p>
Just read on below, then go to www.thinknetwork.com for a brighter future!

THE THINK NETWORK
<br>
WE WILL RENT YOUR UNUSED BRAIN SPACE FOR CA$$$$$H!!!!!

<p>
I'm getting sick of the limit of 24 hour days. I just can't get everything
done. Sound strange? Well, there are others with the same affliction. This
is good news for you!

<p>
I can't help but notice that many other people don't suffer such an
affliction - they have to watch TV or perform some other such mundane
activity to fill in the otherwise empty gaps. These can include such time
wasters as consumption of large amounts of alcohol, reading tabloid
newspapers, or getting desk jobs.

<p>
Sound familiar? It should. We have combed our database of consumer patterns
and profiles, and your consumption patterns have marked you as someone whose
mind could be used more productively. Sounds bad? It's actually a FANTASTIC
OPPORTUNITY, because it makes you a likely candidate for the role of Think
Network Agent. 

<p>
Stop throwing away a valuable, money making resource! Why burn when you
could earn? I'm offering a mutually beneficial arrangment.

<p>
We will PAY YOU TOP DOLLAR to rent your mind for short periods. Any spare
time, say while you're watching soapies, or as an alternative to slow
evening oblivion down the neck of a bottle. You wont get a better deal!

<p>
Not only is this financially rewarding, and harm free*, but studies** have
shown that this can actually be beneficial to the agent (you). In some
cases, you can even retain memories from episodes if desired.

<p>
Our people will be using your brain for offline, creative kinds of work,
like system design, music composition, website design, or graphic artwork.
Some unconscious processing can even be done this way - the guys in the
creative department can be outsourced! We will pay for REM sleep time*.

<p>
Don't think about it - we both know that it only ever causes you trouble.
ACT NOW, start reaping in that CA$$$H, and leave the thinking to the
experts.

  <li>  Government Warning: Leasing out conscious or REM sleep time can be
damaging to your health (Think Network would like to assure our agents that
this is NOT a proven fact)

promote growth of hair and teeth.
