Greg, heres a spin that you may not have heard.  A lot of us space guys
agree our space shuttle is really an ugly solution to the problem of
getting to space.  I have uttered blasphemies against it myself, but
lets look at it for just one minute.  When we really examine the space
shuttle, we must give credit were it is due.  That is one hell of a
sophisticated collection of hardware.  It is amazing in a lotta ways.

<p>
My first vehicle was a Ford pickup truck.  I gave 600 dollars for it in 1977.
It was ugly, used ancient technology when it was assembled in 1967,
was expensive to operate, but when you look at it piece by piece, it
too contained an impressive collection of technology.  Could we
start right now, all of us extropians, and build from scratch a vehicle
comparable to a 67 Ford?  I think the attempt would give us new respect.

<p>
Likewise with the space shuttle.  Certainly has its shortcomings, 60s
vintage technology, (magnetic core memory on the computers, fer
cryin out loud, still!) expensive to operate, and yet, well, we have it.
It does carry stuff to orbit, and like my old truck, it works about
99% of the time.

<p>
I was interested in the recent thread on taking the beast to the moon.
OK, whereas the shuttle cant do that (any more than my 67 Ford
could beat a corvette) the shuttle *could* be used to lift a bunch of
stuff that *could* be used to assemble a decent moon bound craft in
LEO.  That thread from a few months ago (that got me thrown into
a large number of kill files, from which I have yet to emerge {8-[... )
about sending a single tiny woman to Mars was  based on the notion
of using the shuttle to lift the stuff for on-orbit assembly.  That idea
seems much more worthwhile than the space station.

<p>

those things while growing up.  {8-]  spike
