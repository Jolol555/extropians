Let's throw some actual facts into this discussion, rather than speculation.

You neglected to point out that we are talking about a 5-8% differential,
mostly brought about by the mechanics of genetic inheritance.

I think that you are vastly overstating the case here.  Biologically
speaking, humans are what zoologists call 'weakly dimorphic', meaning that
we do not show a large degree of sex differentiation.  Darwin, Dawkins, and
other naturalists have never pointed to sex differents as a huge factor in
large-scale evolution.

<p>
<a name="4558qlink2">No solid evidence whatsoever has been produced as to the relative
promiscuity of early man versus early woman.</a> This assumption was stated in
the earliest writings of evolutionary scholars, but it points more towards
present-day cultural norms than anything based in reality.  Several recent
studies based on DNA sampling have projected<a name="4558qlink3"> that as much as 25% of
children may not be fathered by the husband of a given women.  This has led
many scholars to posit that early woman may have taken on a larger number
</a>
of partners than previously supposed.

<p>
I will agree to this statement, mainly because we have solid evidence to
show it.
