<p>
Perhaps unconscious genetically motivated behaviors will determine what
attributes individuals select. Selection based on perceived beauty may also
derive from unconscious genetically organized factors such as neurological
hard-wired patterns of symmetry which appeal to the eye on the  basis of
that very symmetry. Even new born babies prefer pretty faces to ugly ones.
(pretty = symmetrical with balanced proportions)
