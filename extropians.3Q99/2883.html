<a href="2863.html#2883qlink1">&gt;Socialism also arose spontaneously from the natural order of life.  In a</a><br>
<i>&gt;small band, where meat is scarce - say, one high-value hit per person</i><br>
<i>&gt;per week - while anyone can gather vegetables with effort, a capitalist</i><br>
<i>&gt;economy will develop for vegetables and a socialist economy will develop</i><br>
<i>&gt;for meat.  I'm totally oversimplifying here, but the point is that we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have built-in functions for property rights *and* sharing.  It's just</i><br>
<i>&gt;that only the property-rights mindset can scale up to a national</i><br>
<i>&gt;economy, while the socialist mindset only works within small tribes and</i><br>
families.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2863.html#2883qlink2">&gt;For that matter, even aristocracy arose spontaneously from the natural</a><br>
<i>&gt;order of life.  Most forms of government do.  The "natural order of</i><br>
<i>&gt;life" is a pretty diverse and flexible thing, with lots of</i><br>
<i>&gt;special-purpose code.</i><br>

When it comes to meditation, call me a socialist, because meditation has no
value (no economic value), so let's all share it equally.
When it comes to brains, don't make me conform to socialist idealism. I need
my own cerebral cortex, and it hurts like hell to share.

Climb the mountains and get their good tidings: Nature's peace
will flow into you as sunshine into flowers, the winds will blow
their freshness into you, and the storms, their energy and cares
will drop off like autumn leaves.

Americans are like a rich father who wishes he knew how to give his sons the
hardships that made him rich.
