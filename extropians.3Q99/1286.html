A classic suggestion.  However, interstellar space is more than big enough 
to provide protection.

<p>
<a name="1326qlink1">A typical supernova would have a total energy output of something like 
10^44 ergs.  Applying a little basic geometry, that gives us an energy 
density of 2x10^10 ergs per square meter at a distance of 100 million 
kilometers, which will certainly do a lot of damage.  However, at a 
distance of 1 light-year (9x10^12 kilometers), the energy density drops to 
less than one erg per square meter.  That isn't even enough energy to 
damage electronics, let alone harm people.</a>
Conclusion: Despite their reputation, supernovae are only dangerous to 
people in the same solar system.  They certainly aren't a threat to 
interstellar civilizations.
