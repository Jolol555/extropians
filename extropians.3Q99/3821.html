  IAN: Promoting technology advance and particularly
  technology designed to interface directly with the
  human body and/or mind, such as implants, and at 
  the same time abandoning a strict libertarian
  stance is arguably explicitly unethical. Why?

<p>
  Libertarian principle is the private-property
  principle, period. The idea that technological 
  advances are inherently a boon to humanity is only
  as valid as the ethics behind those who operate
  and control such technology.<a name="3838qlink1"> If they do not adhere
  to the strict private-property principle, the door
  is wide open to the subordination of the individual 
  to "collective interests" as defined by those with
  the most power to enforce their definition of the 
</a>
  "collective interest" with the aid of advanced 
  technology. Based on the track record of human
  societies, technology advance minus a strict 
  adherence to the private-property principle (PPP) 
  is a recipe for the perfection of absolute tyranny. 
 
<p>
<a name="3838qlink2">  While we desire technology advances that will 
  empower the average individual by fostering
  independence from central powers, those in power 
  are interested in technology that will empower 
</a>
  those in power and foster subservience to them.
<a name="3838qlink3">  Technology and its advance is not inherently 
  ethical, and thus the anti-Luddite attitude 
  expressed by Extropians minus the PPP is a
  surefire recipe for the worst technological
  nightmares that we can't even begin to imagine.
  By abandoning strict adherence to the PPP, the

  ExI opens the door to making the future a 
  nightmare, to making technology our enemy.
