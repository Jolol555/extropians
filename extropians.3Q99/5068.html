     I see your point, but I think that overall there is no problem with 
using an effective  nonlethal weapon on an enemy you may wish dead for 
several reasons.  The purpose of a nonlethal weapon would be to incapacitate 
an attacker.  Once incapacitated, further measures could be taken, up o and 
including execution if that were necessary.  The good thing about using a 
ranged nonlethal weapon would be that it would allow you to incapacitate your 
attacker, but gives some leeway for mistakes (for example, missing and 
hitting an innocent bystander, a case of mistaken identity</a> and/or 
misidentification of intention).  I would suggest that this would be in all 
of our best interests as Transhumanists as it could be you or me who were 
that bystander or misidentified assailant.  Friendly fire is a real danger, 
and I think it worthwhile to postpone execution of an enemy to avoid such 
tragedies.

     Yes, it would make abductions somewhat more easy; but they're already 
pretty easy for those who would do so (rohypnol comes to mind), but I think 
it is a downside that might be worth accepting.<a name="5245qlink4">  As for it making crimes more 
</a>
difficult to convict if the victim is not physically harmed....although I too 
am frustrated by how hard it is to convict rapists, I would never wish more 
harm on their victims.  Another option would be to include in our list of 
qualifications for a nonlethal weapon some sort of flashy effect, like a 
large flash of light or loud sound, so the weapon could not be used in a 
stealthy manner, but I think this requirement is likely unrealistic.</a>

<p>
True, any chemical solution will degrade and electric charge dissipate, but 
the question is how long?  I was checking out one weapon on the web that used 
a lithium battery they claimed would hold its charge for 10 years, which if 
true I would find a reasonable amount of time.  As far as shock goes in stun 
type weapons, I think the problem will more likely be that of needing 
differring strengths for different ranges as opposed to body mass.

<p>
     Point taken, but I think it might be easier to achieve wide design 
tolerances in simpler weapons.</a>

<p>
<a name="5245qlink6"><a href="5067.html#5068qlink6">&gt;yes, a smart projectile, variable in impact based on body mass of</a><br>

<p>
     Could you elaborate on this idea; how would the impact be controlled?</a>

<p>
Thanks for the response.
