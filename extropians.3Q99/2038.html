Sorry to quote it all, but it sounds to me like what you want
is an Extropic Analyst to provide strong buy recommendations :-)

<p>
See as a model eharmon.com

<p>
No need really for a whole group to try to make these decisions.
(something else I learned from the angel group is that it is
 exceedingly rare for every member of the group to want to
 invest in a particular startup)

<p>
If multiple people are interested you could have multiple
analysts.

<p>
I think by far the best approach would be to include a spot
in the upcoming Extropian web site for stock discussion, just
like the format of other stock discussion sites.

<i>&gt; &gt; I was not at Extro4, so perhaps you got some tips on companies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; in need of funding.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Only from the perspective of the Geron &amp; Kronos presentations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Geron is currently public, Kronos is not.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; That is the big problem with forming an angel group- finding the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; companies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I wasn't thinking of an Extropian Angel Group per se.  I doubt</i><br>
<i>&gt; that collectively as a group we have the resources for this type</i><br>
<i>&gt; of thing.  (To do this properly you have to have a capital pool</i><br>
<i>&gt; of millions of dollars.)  I was thinking more along the lines</i><br>
<i>&gt; of an Investment Advisory group (club) to review and recomend</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extropian investments.  Examples of this would be Geron and</i><br>
<i>&gt; Alteon which are at very different stages of development but</i><br>
<i>&gt; since they are working on pro-longevity biotech, they would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be the type of investments we might want to pursue.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; My main rationale for this is to see if it is possible to</i><br>
<i>&gt; create a counter-trend to the market emphasis on short-term</i><br>
<i>&gt; ROI.  The volatility in the markets favors the big players</i><br>
<i>&gt; and not the small investors.  The ra-ra Internet stock</i><br>
<i>&gt; enthusiasm creates a bad climate for biotech startups</i><br>
<i>&gt; that have much longer development cycles.  If one always</i><br>
<i>&gt; goes for the short-term, high-ROI investments, that means</i><br>
<i>&gt; the slow-to-develop plays (nanotech, anti-aging research,</i><br>
<i>&gt; etc.) will always get left out.  So one either has to</i><br>
<i>&gt; rely on government funding (which many people in this group</i><br>
<i>&gt; intensely dislike) or wait a long time until the foundation</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies develop to the point where the idea development</i><br>
<i>&gt; is done by many people simultaneously (presumably lowering</i><br>
<i>&gt; the profit margins and ROIs).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While I would not argue that one should put all of ones</i><br>
<i>&gt; investment portfolio into ExI/Foresight compatible investments,</i><br>
<i>&gt; it could be that a collection of individuals with a long term</i><br>
<i>&gt; focus, could invest some percentage (10-20%?) of their investment</i><br>
<i>&gt; dollars into these types of investments with the assumption of</i><br>
<i>&gt; really long term payoffs as well as providing some economic</i><br>
<i>&gt; stability for corporate "management".  I know that I</i><br>
<i>&gt; (as say the president of a biotech company), would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; much more comfortable pursuing a long term strategy</i><br>
<i>&gt; if I knew that some fraction of my shares were being</i><br>
<i>&gt; held by investors that were not going to read every</i><br>
<i>&gt; quarterly report with the intent to sell at the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; hint of bad news or difficulties.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; By the time you see a real press release from a company,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they are probably past the angel stage and into the big VC money</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; (past where we might want to invest).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would disagree.  If you are looking for a big short-term</i><br>
<i>&gt; "payoff" then you want to play the Angel game.  But the big</i><br>
<i>&gt; payoff has associated risks.  I'm looking more for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; approach that if you believe a company has a fundamentally</i><br>
<i>&gt; sound long-term strategy but one that will not sell well</i><br>
<i>&gt; given current mindsets or short-term ROI focus, then you</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to invest for the long term.  Essentially, these</i><br>
<i>&gt; would be the type of investments you would want to fill</i><br>
<i>&gt; your portfolio with if you had to undergo Cryonic suspension.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The "buy em &amp; forget about em" investments.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; You have to be able to meet the management team and really</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; question them before you will have enough confidence to invest.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; While this is always true, it is less of a problem if the company</i><br>
<i>&gt; is already "public".  For example, if Zyvex ever went public,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would certainly be one to accumulate that stock on any</i><br>
<i>&gt; market "softness".  I know the management, I believe in</i><br>
<i>&gt; and want to support the work and if they are successful, I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; I would make a lot of money.  What we need is a "short list"</i><br>
<i>&gt; of 10-20 companies like that that we "know" will ultimately</i><br>
<i>&gt; be successful if they survive long enough.  You need a number</i><br>
<i>&gt; of companies to distribute the risk.</i><br>
