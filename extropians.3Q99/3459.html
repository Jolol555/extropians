Well, nanobots would only let radiation scramble their programs
if they turned off the ECC.  Now, maybe they would do this, just
as bacteria tend to when starvation/death looms on the horizon.

Very nice idea.  So Lamarck, was simply ahead of his time.
It would be interesting if this were combined with Moravec's
idea regarding robots simulating ever more complex robots.
Grey goo that figures out how to communicate &amp; cooperate
to donate processing capacity to simulations, gets to
more rapidly evolve into more advanced grey goo.

<p>
Maybe hive minds are the true endpoint.

<p>
Very interesting.
