<a name="4733qlink1"><a name="4690qlink1">I think your own argument can be used against your position.
Singapore has to have one of the most rigid top-down controlled
environments in the world.  I would be very interested if someone
knows the details of things like gun laws, etc. there, but my
suspicion would be that they are very strict.  While on the
<a name="4686qlink1">economic side of things they are fairly relaxed and open
I think things are much more regulated in terms of personal
freedoms (driving a car, littering, drugs, pornography, etc.).</a></a></a>

<a name="4733qlink2"><a name="4716qlink2"><a name="4690qlink2"><a name="4686qlink2">And yet there is relatively little violence in Singapore to the
best of my knowledge.  Why?  This is also generally true I
believe for Japan.  [While you might make the "martial law"
case for Singapore, I doubt you can make it for Japan.]  IMO,
one could begin to make a case for either (a) genetics; or
(b) cultural values as being the determining factors in expressions
of violence.  I believe that the three countries with the largest per
capita prison populations are the U.S., China and Russia.  Given the
diversity of governments in these countries, it seems difficult to pin
the violence card on the government.  I will admit however that
teasing apart per-capita prison populations is probably a poor
approach due to the problems of political prisoners and really
stupid (drug) laws.</a></a></a></a>
