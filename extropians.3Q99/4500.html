The U.S.A. sacrificed Taiwan for the ``non-caring'' mainland China.
That certainly made friends.

Maybe Eliezer S. Yudkowsky &lt;sentience@pobox.com&gt; answered:

<p>
Around here people know that the U.S.A. enjoys enormous differences in wealth.
Those that hate the ``rich'' Americans, would then logically also hate the
``rich'' Japanese and EUropeans.

<p>
The U.S.A. as the world police certainly make enemies, but the American
tendency to take the American way as granted also makes enemies.  The old
saying ``In Rome as the the Romans'' would be a nice addition to the
education of Americans going abroad, I guess.  !-|

<p>
How large part of the world press belongs to the ``controlled'' cathegory?
