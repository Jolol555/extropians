<a href="2703.html#2708qlink1">&gt; I think in a society with a mature nanotech it is ethically the right thing</a><br>
<i>&gt; to make sure all of its citizens have an adequate level of free medical,</i><br>
<i>&gt; education,  housing and food.  I feel this is the humane thing to do yet I</i><br>
<i>&gt; feel it should just be at a level to meet basic needs and not to elevate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; lazy to a grand lifestyle.  So for those who want the "good things of life"</i><br>
<i>&gt; such as a mansion, education at Stanford, gourmet meals, and exotic cosmetic</i><br>
<i>&gt; surgery will have to work for it.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2703.html#2708qlink2">&gt; It is simply that the unambitious citizen of 2100 A.D. will have a lifestyle</a><br>
<i>&gt; better then that of a solid middle-class citizen of our own time.</i><br>

<p>
The only reason why unambitious citizens, can't afford these things now, is
because the government is using taxation to rob him on one hand, and then using
regulation to make the cost of living a great deal higher than it otherwise
would be.
