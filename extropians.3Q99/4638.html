<p>
Maybe they weren't news in the past simply because the news industry
thought the ideas involving a fairly distant future wouldn't be
interesting to most people?

<p>

<a href="4515.html#4638qlink3">&gt; &gt;  The changes that I see taking place towards the end of this century,</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  including those changes in discussion about the following century, seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  nothing other than the logical, historically predicitable, outcome of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  the renaissance and the enlightenment. We're descendants of Bacon,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Descartes, Newton, etc. Science improves, and eventually turns its eye</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  towards the brain, towards artificial brains, and so on. This seems</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  totally obvious, and was predicted years ago.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Seems obvious to me, too :-) Which is why I have repeatedly called </i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanism and especially extropianism "The New Enlightenment."</i><br>

<p>
Sounds great!

<p>
<a href="4515.html#4638qlink4">&gt; &gt;  I guess my general question would be: What's the big deal? I get the</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  sense that a lot of what I read here is just cheerleading for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  inevitable. I don't mean to say that it's not very cool stuff being</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  celebrated. But it's just the train we're on, little more.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; We should be in the mainstream *while* maintaining our daring</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  &gt; and original character.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  Another way to ask my question would be: what is it that's daring here?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  </i><br>

<p>
&lt;interesting stuff snipped&gt;

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="4794qlink1"><a href="4515.html#4638qlink5">&gt; Transhumanism and extropianism are "daring" in exactly the same</a><br>
<i>&gt; way that humanism, science and classical liberalism were "daring"</i><br>
<i>&gt; when they were new.  In historical terms (to say nothing of</i><br>
<i>&gt; biological terms), these ideas are very, very new.</i><br>

<p>
If you're thinking of the views of the majority, you're absolutely right
about the newness. In fact it isn't even *close* to a majority that
believes techno-humanist ideas, even today in 1999.</a>

<p>
<a name="4794qlink2">I guess I didn't realize how much measures of success in this group
(these groups) involve the general public. It makes sense of course that
the general public should be taken into account!

<p>
But I still don't see a justification for "daring". Science and humanism
were daring a few hundred years ago because people who advocated them
were at risk of losing their life. Many did lose their lives.

<p>
No one advocating really smart computers or technological enhancements
to the brain is very likely to be executed. (There are always
psychopaths of course. But they can target anyone.) Indeed society
*loves* these ideas. The media has been eating them up at a ferocious
pace.</a>


<p>
<a name="4794qlink3">The snipped stuff included a lot that sounded Libertarian. Some other
posts made me think that extropianism *wasn't* libertarian. Well, if
extropianism *is* libertarian, then then there's certainly a lot for
libertarians to toast these days. But that has to do with what seem like
very separate issues, like the state's relation to the individual
person. Technology is a different matter.</a>

<p>
<a name="4794qlink4">Thanks for the lengthy, very useful article.</a>

<p>
Cheers,
