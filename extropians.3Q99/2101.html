Abstract
<br>
  BACKGROUND: Omega3 fatty acids may inhibit
  neuronal signal transduction pathways in a manner similar to that of lithium
  carbonate and valproate, 2 effective treatments for bipolar disorder. The
  present study was performed to examine whether omega3 fatty
  acids also exhibit mood-stabilizing properties in bipolar
  disorder. METHODS: A 4-month, double-blind, placebo-controlled study,
  comparing omega3 fatty acids (9.6 g/d) vs
  placebo (olive oil), in addition to usual treatment, in 30 patients with
  bipolar disorder. RESULTS: A Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the cohort
  found that the omega3 fatty acid patient group had a
  significantly longer period of remission than the placebo group (P = .002;
  Mantel-Cox). In addition, for nearly every other outcome measure, the omega3
  fatty acid group performed better than the placebo group.
  CONCLUSION: Omega3 fatty acids were well
  tolerated and improved the short-term course of illness in this preliminary
  study of patients with bipolar disorder.
