No, it could also be necessary that the SIs don't have something *else*
they want to do with atoms.  I mean, if you're postulating optimization,
I bet even I could devise far more entertaining lifeforms that run on
our atoms.  If we're going to be this silly, you've just proved that
they'll kill us off and replace us with entities that are more efficient
at entertaining; say, Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

I think it's *more* likely - but not actually likely per se - that they
would keep us around to "encourage" other Singularities.  If they acted
for reasons we could understand and rely on, it might be worthwhile to
devote a huge quadrillionth of computing time to make us a little less
nervous.  Depends on how observant we can be, I suppose.
