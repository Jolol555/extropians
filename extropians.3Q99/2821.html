I don't think this is going to tell us much unless we ask the same question
on another mailing list as a control group.  I suspect that A)  People who
spend a lot of time in electronic communication may have a somewhat
different psychological profile than people who do not B)  People will be
more inclined to reply to any yes-or-no poll when they can answer the
question "yes", as shown by the responses to the smoking poll (It seemed
like 80% of people who replied to that poll said that yes, they do smoke,
which would be around double the rate in the general population)  and C)  As
already mentioned, many if not most people feel alienated as children.

<p>
A poll in another group would control for these factors and possible give us
enough information to compare extropians to that group.
