Researchers Invent Way to Accelerate Rate of Scientific Discoveries;
Implications Profound for Medicine, Science and Business

<p>
WASHINGTON, July 7 /PRNewswire/ -- Imagine Christopher Reeve being able
to walk in half the expected time. Or life-saving pharmaceuticals to
fight cancer or AIDS brought to market in one-third the time. Or
overhauling the U.S. education system to create first-rate curriculums
which produce smarter students. These are just a few of the things
possible with a new patent pending scientific process introduced by
researchers at Extreme Innovation Labs (EI Labs), in partnership with
Knowledge Management Consortium International (KMCI). EI Labs is a
non-profit think tank devoted to studies to improve the rate of
discovery for business, science, and society. KMCI is a non-profit
society of researchers, executives, managers, and scientists addressing
organizational knowledge management.

<p>
The patent-pending process increases the rate of scientific discovery by

<p>
having teams of scientists actually study and experiment with research
environments to find ways to speed up the discovery process. The process

<p>
is literally making breakthroughs in knowledge creation research and
leveraging it in ways that can accelerate the rate of worldwide
innovation.

<p>
For example, in the scientific/medical community where research is being

<p>
conducted on nerve regeneration and spinal cord injuries, applying this
methodology could provide cures in half the timeregeneration and spinal
cord injuries, applying this methodology could provide cures in half the

<p>
time simply by studying and improving the environment and process for
research itself. Similarly, by applying this research to drug

<p>
``Managing institutional knowledge to better achieve goals is always a
challenge for the corporate community, the medical/scientific community,

<p>
and high technology industry. But by actually engineering the
environments in which human beings learn and make discoveries, we open
an entire world of possibilities for an increased rate of new
discoveries,'' said Ed Swanstrom, President of KMCI and director of EI
Labs. ``We have literally turned knowledge on itself to accelerate its
creation and, as a result, the benefits to virtually every science and
business are endless,'' he continued.

<p>
``The concept is simple. Yet, this is the first time accelerating the
rate of scientific discovery has been studied. The benefits to society
mabeen studied. The benefits to society may be extraordinary,'' said
Steve Fuller, Professor of Sociology at Warwick Univer

<p>
Extreme Innovation Labs is a science acceleration think tank working
with research institutions worldwide.

<p>
Knowledge Management Consortium International (KMCI) is a non-profit
organization founded in 1997 as a community for KM researchers and
business professionals. KMCI's members come from such areas as business,

<p>
science of science, sociology of knowledge, cognitive psychology,
library science, management science, economics, computer science,
medicine, telecommunications, law, organizational learning, artificial
intelligence, and more.
