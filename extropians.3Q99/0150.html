Hi,

	
<p>
I'm a new member. I deal at the National Stock Exchange
Bombay(INDIA).

<p>
It was interesting to read the bit about market efficiency.
I know from my experience that the stocks we pick at a
particular time of the day or whatever(week/month) are
all to be considered a judgement based on our knowledge
at that particular time. You also have to review every
now and then(daily/weekly/monthly) whether to hold on
or sell.People who complain of not making a profit are
lazy and do not review their portfolio.

<p>
If you were rafting down a river fast would you go to
sleep even for a second? That's how you have to be in 
the stock market.AWAKE! Naturally the person who makes
money in the stock market is capable of hanging on inspite
of the deluge of information that hits him everyday.

<p>
<a name="0156qlink1">Regarding a bubble that will burst lots of people have
been proved wrong about the US market (from dow 5000 to
10000).It's like the Indian monsoon.You know it's raining
heavily but can anyone predict how long it will rainone
 day,two,three or fifteen? Better to carry an umbrella
</a>with you.Get it?

<p>
Bye!
