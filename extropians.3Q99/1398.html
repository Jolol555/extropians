<a href="1383.html#1398qlink2">&gt; Actually, there is a known abiogenic mechanism (water photolysis, with</a><br>
<i>&gt; the hydrogen escaping into space) which constantly replenishes the</i><br>
<i>&gt; oxygen pool, and some not well characterized mechanisms which removes</i><br>
the oxygen from the atmosphere (probably mostly oxidation of volcanic
material).

<p>
True, but I suspect most of the oxygen in the atmosphere comes from the
plants grabing the Carbon away from the CO2.  Carbon and Oxygen are
in relative equal abundance in the sun &amp; solar system.  However, hydrogen
is hugely overabundant.  So when the system starts out, everything is going
to be in a "reduced" chemical state, e.g. mostly CH4 and H2O.  There may only
be a little CO2 available.

<p>
Over time, if "normal" life is present, it will harvest the C from CH4 or
CO2 meaning that Hydrogen and Oxygen get released.  That makes more water
(or if the hydrogen escapes), it leaves oxygen which gets sucked up by
any unoxidized metals (e.g. iron).

<p>
If you are a *true believer*, you want "them" to burn all the oil and coal
they can get their hands on....  Why?  Because oil or coal in the ground
is carbon that belongs to someone else.  Carbon dioxide in the atmosphere
is carbon that is free for me (and my very close friends)... :-)  [And
before somebody jumps *all* over me, by "free", I mean that I can harvest
it out of the atmosphere for "free" *iff* I have the solar power to do it.]
