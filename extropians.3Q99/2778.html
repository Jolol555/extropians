As I mentioned &amp; tried to show in my letter -- Dyson sphere will not
be seen around visible stars.  So, this search was doomed from the
start.

This is better.  But 100 pc out isn't very far (~300 ly).
The "logical" thing for SI's is to put the spheres far away
from sources of nasty radiation (i.e. the galaxy core or black
holes) as well as to use the smallest stars possible (both for
decreasing communication delays and extending longevity).
Contrast this with the 400 billion objects by the est. by
the Gravitational Microlensing oberservations, in the halo,
at 0.3-0.5 Msun  -- They are many, far away and should be faint.
Slysh may understand some components of the problem since
he is very aware of Kardashev's perspective.  Fundamentally
the problem is that he does not have the instrumentation required
for detection.

Clearly looking at a star.  The fundamental problem with Dyson shells
is that they should be *very* difficult to see in the visible.  So,
so long as astronomers/SETI people keep looking at "visible" stars,
they will keep coming up empty handed.  At least they started with
an IRAS source which is the right way to go.  The problem is that
the resolution of the IRAS data isn't very high and the frequency
bands only give you barely enough information to make temperature
estimates.  Kardashev's subsequent work (not in Ander's list) does
list a number of unusual features in the distribution of IRAS
detectable objects around the galaxy.  Since one would expect
extragalactical sourcs to have a uniform distribution, it would
seem that they are detecting galactic assymetries.  I list this
as a possible point of interest in my Matrioshka Brain paper.

Re: sources

<p>
I have almost all of the sources mentioned converted and available in a
(private) HTML database related to this this work.  There is very little
that has been done in the astronomical community of which I am unaware
(only for example unpublished studies with negative results).
