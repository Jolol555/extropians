I'm categorically against it -- if Clint means the government provides them
or, more accurately, some people force others to provide them.  If Clint
wants them done voluntarily -- without force, i.e., through donations,
gifts, etc. -- then I've no problem with it.

<p>
Of course, in the US, we practically have the kind of welfare state (for
some segments of the population) Clint is advocating.  In the past few
decades, its managed to increase the cost of just about everything all while
increase the amount of destitute people.  This ought to enough evidence,
though if one needs more, just look at everywhere else.:)

<p>
This is just another reason to get off the planet.  Let the welfare statists
and socialists of various stripes slug it out while some of us can get the
heck away.:)  (Of course, we all know nanotech will provide.:)

<p>
Cheers!
