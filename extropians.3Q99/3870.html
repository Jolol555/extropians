<a name="3878qlink1">&lt;&lt; . . . Om Yo Ricio actually
<br>
 sent people out to Africa in an attempt to get Ebola samples for use as
 biological agents. &gt;&gt;
</a>

<a name="3878qlink2">See also, reference: Olson, Kyle B. Aum Shinrikyo: Once and Future Threat?  
<br>
_Emerging Infectious Diseases_ Special Issue Biological Warfare.  5:513-516. <br>
(July/August) 1999.

<p>
This article's purpose is to understand, not only this cult, but other 
extreme and terrorist groups potentially using biological weapons.</a>  They have 
cultured/produced botulism toxin, sarin gas, anthrax, cholera, and Q-fever.  
Ebola collection was attempted by the cult's own doctors and nurses posing as 
a humanitarian mission to Zaire. 

<p>
Apparently, this cult has not (yet) recruited competent (competent enough) 
microbiologists even with an estimated $1.5 billion in funds (this funding 
amount was  estimated by a cult leader in March 1995.)  Aum has/had an 
estimated 20,000-40,000 members.  

<p>
Aum attempted several unsuccessful botulism (and one anthrax) attacks between 
1990 and 1995.  Aum killed seven people and sent 500 others to hospitals on 
June 27, 1994.  This was an attack using sarin against a residential complex 
housing three judges -- who were about to make a ruling against the cult. 
This attack was well before the March 20, 1995 Tokyo subway sarin attack, 
which was possibly designed to kill as many police and disrupt the Japanese 
government.

<p>
<a name="3881qlink1"><a name="3878qlink3">Nanotech attacks, similar in strategy, purpose and use by Aum and other 
cult/extremist groups will be very difficult to control without several 
anti-crime forces pushing against them, using technology I can only guess</a> at. 
<a name="3878qlink4"><a name="3874qlink1"> What technologies can be used without hindering nanotech development and 
retaining the level of freedom, privacy, and liberty extropians desire?</a>  Do 
<a name="3878qlink5">we develop James L. Halperin's _Truth Machine_ fool-proof lie detector first 
or concurrently?
