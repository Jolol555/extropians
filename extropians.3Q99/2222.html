<p>
I can't believe the term Free Will can accurately apply to a single entity,
acting alone, because it self-contradicts, self-cancels, self-nullifies, and
brain-locks an entity (or agent) that tries to simultaneously act with
freedom and with willfulness (assuming "free" denotes indeterminate, and
"will" indicates determination).
<br>
When either the determinants of willfulness, or the indeterminability of
freedom prevails, action can resume.
<br>
(This analogizes to locking up a neutral solenoid by simultaneously sending
both positive and negative signals to it.)

<p>
Consequently, the term Free Will makes sense only when it refers to agents
acting within larger systems, in which case, Free Will means approximately
the same as self-actualization, self-determination, independent action,
etc., which derives from considerations apart from the system that
constrains particular agents or entities.

<p>
By this account, extropy manifests Free Will in proportion as it acts in
contrast to entropic systems Sometimes extropy self-organizes freely, and
sometimes willfully, as it adapts its own systems in ever more potent
complexity transcending entropy.
