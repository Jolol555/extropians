If you go to this site and select "sleeping aids" from the pull down
list, then hit the "See Results" button:

<p>

<p>
you will see the results of an online survey for people with Chronic
Fatigue Syndrome about which sleep aids helped them the most.  Their
underlying biochemical problems might be completely different from
yours, so some of these might be unique to helping CFS'ers, but a lot of
them are standard sleeping aids.  Many are supplements available over
the counter.

<p>
Watch out for 5-HTP, as many samples have been found to be
contaminated.  If anybody knows where to get really pure stuff, please
let me know.

<p>
Some people with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome get cortisol levels that are
high at night and low in the morning, the opposite of how they should
be, and this can cause the disrupted sleep pattern that you are
experiencing. I have no idea whether this might apply in your case, but
you could try getting a 24 hour cortisol/DHEA test. 
I got mine (normal) from Great Smokies Diagnostic Lab, who seem to be
well respected:

<p>
You have to get a prescription.  If you decide it's for you, keep
looking until you find an open minded doctor; the life extension
foundation has a list of them on their site, and GSDL has a list of
doctors as well.  It's about $150.

<p>
If your cortisol levels are too low, they can be supplemented with
cortisol or prednisone.  If they are too high, I understand there are
ways to modify that as well, although I don't know how off hand.

<p>
Disregulated cortisol levels are associated with prior chronic stress,
such as a chaotic childhood.

<p>
All that said, I think there are genetic reasons why some people are
"night people".  It's pretty hard to change.

<p>
There is a book called "Safe Uses of Cortisol" on my shelf that I no
longer need if any Bay Area person wants it enough to come pick it up.
