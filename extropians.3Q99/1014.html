As long as I'm not one of the charlatans to which you refer, I agree with you.

investigate one of these claims &gt;every once in a while, as a way of keeping 
his classification scheme accurate, &gt;and he will slowly build up a list of 
others who he trusts to accurately assess &gt;such claims.

<p>
That's more or less precisely what I've been doing.

<a href="0983.html#1014qlink2">&gt;Now, I know nothing about this "Face on Mars business".  However, I am well </a><br>

<p>
That's been the running argument since this whole controvesy broke out in the 
early 80s.  Some "reserachers" have certainly fallen prey to it.  But I'm 
satisfied that the Mars formations aren't an example of this, for several 
reasons.  For one thing, this isn't "conecting the dots" a la the Man in the 
Moon.  The "Face," if it is a face, is a distinct, chiseled-looking 
morphology, not a mass of disconnected landforms connected by Lowellian 
sightlines.

<p>
<a href="0983.html#1014qlink3">&gt;That, plus the fact that there have been several similar claims about alien </a><br>
<i>&gt;artifacts on Earth and on the Moon (all of which have turned out to be </i><br>
false), &gt;leads me to suspect that these claims will probably turn out to be 
false.  Since &gt;the idea of technological aliens having visited our solar 
system in any fashion 
<br>
<a href="0983.html#1014qlink4">&gt;is itself problematic (it is virtually impossible to construct a scenario </a><br>
<a name="1074qlink2"><i>&gt;that makes any sense), </i><br>

<p>
Huh?  I could go a few rounds with you on that one, but I'm making</a> a run for 
<a name="1074qlink3">a latte in a minute, so I'll save that book for another time...

<p>
<i>&gt;I conclude that there is no reason for me to invest several days of my time </i><br>
<a href="0983.html#1014qlink5">&gt;learning all the details of the theory.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="0983.html#1014qlink6">&gt;If I happen to be wrong, firm evidence will turn up in time (and the fact </a><br>
<i>&gt;that I dismissed it for a few years won't hurt me).  If I'm right, I've </i><br>
<i>&gt;saved myself some time.  Either way I'm not going to waste time arguing </i><br>
<i>&gt;with people who believe in the theory (I leave that to the people who have </i><br>
<i>&gt;actually investigated this particular claim).</i><br>

<p>
<a href="0983.html#1014qlink7">&gt;Do you think there is something wrong with this strategy?</a><br>

<p>
No.  In fact, it's one of the maybe three or four reasonable posts on this 
subject that I've read.
