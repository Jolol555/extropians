One of the common problems with human discourse is the tendency for someone to
attack the inverse or converse of the statement made by another.  If the nature
of the statement is such that it is true but has a false inverse/converse, then
each side is making a true statement while under the impression that the other is
unjustly attacking, a basic flammable mixture.  Richard Feynman once said, "If I
say that science is good, that does not mean that that which is not science is
not good, if you know how to reason."

Given that technology spontaneously evolved here, if it can be shown that the
conditions of this earth are very common in the Universe, then one would expect
technology to be common.  However, if our conditions are unique in the Universe,
technology may still be common, although one would not expect it to have come
about in the same way.  It is hard to shake this planetary, H2O, carbon
chemistry, amino acid, poly peptide, RNA-DNA, cellular, eukaryotic, O2 breathing,
mammalian, homo, walking upright, ... Chauvinism.
