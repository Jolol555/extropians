<p>
I noticed this book showing up in the Science News book list
on Aug, 28th.  Given my perspective that a huge amount of
what currently goes on with humans is unconscious genetically
motivated behaviors, and perspectives that others may have that
ultimately the human mind has "control" over things, I thought it
would be useful to draw attention to this book.

<p>
<a name="3799qlink1">I *have not* read the book (only the abstract in Science News).
I have glanced at the reviews on Amazon.com and they have
a very wide range (which I would guess implies some very
controversial material).</a>

<p>
However, the Science News review says -- Etcoff formulates a
thesis that binds physical attractiveness to our evolutionary
roots and the survival of our genes.

<p>
<a name="3800qlink1">As such, whether it is true or not, it is probably worth reading
for people who envision "self-selection" of their own attributes
<br>
(physical, mental, emotional, etc.).<a name="3810qlink1">  The self-selection of<br>
attributes presumably depends to some degree on how one perceives
those attributes will be received by those around you.  From
my perspective, a more significant question is, what attributes
will individuals select, when anyone can select them?  Will
they select the putative biological "norms" that have been most
successful, or will individuals attempt to distinguish themselves
from the "norm" in creative, unusual or even freaky ways?
