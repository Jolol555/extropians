<i>&gt; &gt; No he isn't = he is defending the noble present</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; read &lt;<a href="http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html</a>&gt; and see</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; if you all can step up to the mark.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Unfortunately, this document is meaningless, being nothing but the</i><br>
<i>&gt; assembled culture of a small segment of society with little direct</i><br>
<i>&gt; influence on the culture as a whole (but of course great indirect</i><br>
<i>&gt; influence by what they produce).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Language, unlike reality, is a matter of consensus.  There are</i><br>
<i>&gt; no central authorities and no testable theories.  No matter how</i><br>
<i>&gt; many times you may protest that "gay" means "joyful", the fact is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that when the word is encountered by a typical English-speaking</i><br>
<i>&gt; reader, the first meaning that jumps to mind is "homosexual".  As</i><br>
<i>&gt; much as we want "hacker" to keep its original meaning as someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; who pushes limits and explores possibilities, the simple fact is</i><br>
<i>&gt; that 99% of English-speaking readers who encounter the word think</i><br>
<i>&gt; about teenagers breaking into computers illegally.  Merriam-Webster</i><br>
<i>&gt; includes both senses of the word, no doubt because computer geeks</i><br>
<i>&gt; pestered them into including the original usage, but there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; doubt that writers and editors in the real world use only the</i><br>
<i>&gt; commonly understood meaning--what we would call a "cracker" (a</i><br>
<i>&gt; term used by absolutely no one but those still clinging to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; past glory of the word "hacker").</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I too lament the loss of a good word.  But it /is/ lost, and it's</i><br>
<i>&gt; time to just get over it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Oddly enough, I disagree. I think if you support the cracker/hacker
distinction, push it and it may gain popularity. People in general are
increasingly familiar with computers and the net, going beyond the hype
because of their own, direct experience. I think that the world is ready for
a general purpose term for "computer wizards", as a distinction from
vandals, and might quite like the words hacker and cracker in this
configuration.

<p>
Interestingly, my strongest experience of the word hacker in the computing
world has been in contexts such as "Harry the hacker" - derogatory, closer
to the literary "hack", meaning that one is untrained, unprofessional, and
of possessing limited gifts. Exactly the opposite meaning to that proposed
in the hacker/cracker distinction, and different from hacker as vandal.

<p>
This meaning comes across in computer science texts and the academic world,
and in the business IT world (a horrible place to be sure).
