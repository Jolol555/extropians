<a name="3030qlink1">Believing as you do, that freedom should hold a lower priority than
education, do you still consider yourself to be an extropian?  How do
you reconcile your beliefs with the Extropian principals of Open
Society and Self Direction?  Under your system of government, no one
would be allowed to act in a manner which the government disagrees with
("so should they be FORCED to learn evolution").

<p>
If you're not familiar with our principles, please take a look at:

<p>
If you don't consider yourself and extropian, and were just giving us
another perspective, then I welcome your input, although I disagree.</a>

<a name="3030qlink2">Reiterating, freedom and open, dynamic societies allow ideas to compete
<a name="3017qlink1">with one another.  Those of us who hold that rational thinking is
superior to irrational religious thinking will compete more effectively
against those who don't, and eventually there will be fewer and fewer
religious people and finally none at all.</a>

<p>
Your use of force is simply a way of closing society to alternative
inputs.  Eventually your technocratic government will overlook a
possible excellent solution or answer to a problem because it doesn't
fall into the One Best Way.</a>

"If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from us in peace.  We ask not your counsel nor your arms.  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.  May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen."   --Samuel Adams
