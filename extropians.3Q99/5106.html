<p>
Do ya suppose there's a connection between this phenomenon and the
cosmological constant?  If there is indeed an exotic repulsive energy
filling empty space could it perhaps be ever so slightly pushing these
spacecraft back toward the sun?  I haven't seen this mentioned as an
explanation, but it seems so obvious...

<p>
Maybe it even has something to do with the apparent tendency for giant
planets to migrate inward toward their stars.

<p>
Hey, who knows?
