<i>&gt; &gt; Yes indeed, it rather makes one wonder about the true motives of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hyper-legislative socialists (by "socialists" I simply mean those who</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; believe that government can resolve sociobiological difficulties).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Don't Hong Kong and Singapore have population densities comparable to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Chicago or New York? But the crime rates of the former don't come close to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; those of the latter, so over-crowding alone doesn't explain violence. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; find your observation that violent behavior can come about as a response</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to busybodies (AKA leftist control freaks) has merit.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I think your own argument can be used against your position.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Singapore has to have one of the most rigid top-down controlled</i><br>
<i>&gt; environments in the world.  I would be very interested if someone</i><br>
<i>&gt; knows the details of things like gun laws, etc. there, but my</i><br>
<i>&gt; suspicion would be that they are very strict.  While on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; economic side of things they are fairly relaxed and open</i><br>
<i>&gt; I think things are much more regulated in terms of personal</i><br>
<i>&gt; freedoms (driving a car, littering, drugs, pornography, etc.).</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4718qlink1">As was the US in the 1950's. Crime was amazingly low then. Isn't it
wonderful when the media is dedicated to keeping the populatin
programmed with the governments line?</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="4681.html#4716qlink2">&gt; And yet there is relatively little violence in Singapore to the</a><br>
<i>&gt; best of my knowledge.  Why?  This is also generally true I</i><br>
<i>&gt; believe for Japan.  [While you might make the "martial law"</i><br>
<i>&gt; case for Singapore, I doubt you can make it for Japan.]  IMO,</i><br>
<i>&gt; one could begin to make a case for either (a) genetics; or</i><br>
<i>&gt; (b) cultural values as being the determining factors in expressions</i><br>
<i>&gt; of violence.  I believe that the three countries with the largest per</i><br>
<i>&gt; capita prison populations are the U.S., China and Russia.  Given the</i><br>
<i>&gt; diversity of governments in these countries, it seems difficult to pin</i><br>
<i>&gt; the violence card on the government.  I will admit however that</i><br>
<i>&gt; teasing apart per-capita prison populations is probably a poor</i><br>
<i>&gt; approach due to the problems of political prisoners and really</i><br>
<i>&gt; stupid (drug) laws.</i><br>

<a name="4718qlink2">Many asian cultures are counterpoints only because I beleive we are
viewing these societies AFTER they have had a chance to utilize a slow
rate of genocide over hundreds or thousands of years to weed out the
non-conformists, the non-sheep.</a> Of course such societies will have lower
crime rates.<a name="4718qlink3"> But then again, look at the violence perpetrated by the
governments of Japan, China, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Indonesia against
their own people and against their neighbors.</a> Societies that are highly
structured might be seemingly peaceful<a name="4718qlink4"> and well run for a while, but at
some point the collective stress reaches such a level that they drift
</a>
into national madness, warfare, and genocide. Some 40-60 million asians
have been slaughtered this century<a name="4718qlink5"> in asian societies that socialists
have always pointed to as wonderfully organised, socialised, and
</a>
'peaceful'.

<a href="4681.html#4716qlink3">&gt; Does anyone know if there is a site that lists international</a><br>
