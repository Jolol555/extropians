Anders, the only two dreams I've ever had that contained 'extropian' content
were about future cities, one of which was built around waterfalls.  The
other was a interconnected lattice of archologies rising high above a giant
sprawling city, and was probably the result of playing Sim City 2000 too
much.  The waterfall city dream may have been inspired by yours and Forrest
Bishops ideas although I can't remember the actual thread.  The city was a
giant structure of interlinking metal 'pipes' that 'suspended' buildings
throughout the waterfalls.  In the dream I started to rise from ground level
to these hundreds of buildings suspended in midair (not unlike some Japanese
archology designs I've seen since).  Eventually I found myself inside one of
the buildings and was suprised to find it had a transparent floor revealing
the cascading waterfalls stretching down to a haze of rising steam below.
The buildings didn't appear big enough to live in and I'm unsure how you
were suppose to travel from one to another, but then dreams are rarely
practical.  (Also, the whole thing had a tendency to sway in the wind, which
would probably cause motion sickness.)
