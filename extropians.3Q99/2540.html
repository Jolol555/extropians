<a name="2560qlink1">    yea. ok, so lets say ive got this antimatter clock merrily spinning away, 
backwards, suspended via maglev in a vacuum chamber. then, to be ornery, i 
adjust the magnetic field slightly to tilt the clock to the side... how does 
the clock respond? does it actually tilt? that would require that it move 
forward in time...</a>
<p>
    or am i just picturing your anology wrong, mike? i find this very

pretend to worship her, but at least i admit it when my gods are make believe 
and my worship is a facade..."
