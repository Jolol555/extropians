 figured out how to verify, so I must treat them as fiction.  The one
 about the guy who tried to hang/shoot himself, missed, bullet cut
 the rope, etc, now that just couldnt be true.  &gt;&gt;

Oh Ye of little faith Spike, if there is one thing I have learned in my life 
it's that weird s** t happens.  I have a nephew only 3 years of age and 
despite his mothers constant  watch, the boy has been to the hospital more 
times than anyone can remember.  Stitches, burns, skin graphs the boy doesn't 
have the survival instincts God gave cabbage.  He runs around like a blind 
gopher in a field of land mines.  The sad part about this is that he doesn't 
learn from his pain he just builds up a tolerance to it.  I fear that one of 
these days soon he's just going to stroll right off a cliff and make this 
list.  That's why I check it, to make sure he's not on it.
