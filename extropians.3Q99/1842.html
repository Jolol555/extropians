<a href="1839.html#1842qlink1">&gt; I went to a Mensa gathering as an undergraduate at UCLA.  You're right.  It </a><br>
<i>&gt; was fun for a visit, but I wouldn't want to make it a religious routine to </i><br>
<i>&gt; attend their meetings.  The other thing which has bothered me of recent </i><br>
<i>&gt; vintage is that their criterion is the staid, old verbal/spatial reasoning </i><br>
<i>&gt; aspect of IQ.  Go into any Barnes and Noble and check out their tests for the </i><br>
<i>&gt; masses.</i><br>
<i>&gt; They just don't 'get it'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Mensans conveniently forget that IQ is now defined to measure other things in </i><br>
<i>&gt; a person, viz. Creativity, Kinesthetics, Music Ability, etc.  If Mensa was </i><br>
<i>&gt; really concerned about some arbitrary cutoff of intellectual skills (the </i><br>
<i>&gt; upper 2% if my 30 year old memory since college is correct), then they must </i><br>
<i>&gt; include famous actors/actresses/musicians,athletes, etc. people whose IQ as </i><br>
<i>&gt; defined by Mensans would be insinuatingly mediocre, but who have proven </i><br>
<i>&gt; themselves as easily qualifying in the top 1 or 2% in their own 'intellectual </i><br>
<i>&gt; abilities'.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="1854qlink1">I have been a member of both Mensa and Intertel (International 
Legion of Intelligence, upper 1%), but let my memberships lapse 
long ago because I found it more interesting to associate with 
people with whom I shared interests than with people with whom I 
shared test scores.
