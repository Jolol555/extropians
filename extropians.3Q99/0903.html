<a name="0913qlink1">Could you help me out al little further? (here's the idea elaborated) This
structure would be just that, only devised to demonstrate the possible
height. It would not be a building, or have an elevator</a> or door. It would
<a name="0913qlink2">just be the least amount of required materials to achieve maximum tall. Can
I have some answers on how high and how minimal</a> of a structure could be
<a name="0913qlink3">built. If I were to build as far as is humanly possible, how high could I go
with the perfect circumference (as minimal as possible</a> yet strong enough to
<a name="0913qlink4">hold up).
