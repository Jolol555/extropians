Short answer: I don't know.

<p>
Long answer: I know nothing about Williams work but from the distorted hints
I've read I can speculate on how it might work, I could be wrong. Some shinny
materials slightly rotate the plane of polarization of the light reflected by them,
but only when the material is magnetized. Up to now the rotation was too small
to be useful but I know lots of people were trying to increase it, perhaps Williams
found a substance where the effect was large enough to be practical.

<p>
Writing super tiny magnetic dots would be easier than reading them. Use a
conventional magnetic head to expose a rather large area with a weak
magnetic field. Normally the field is too weak to change anything but
if you use a LASER to heat a tiny spot it will change it's magnetic orientation
to that of the field, any place not heated will be unchanged. I don't know for
sure that's how the gadget works or if Williams can really sell it at the price
he says as soon as he says, but I hope so.
