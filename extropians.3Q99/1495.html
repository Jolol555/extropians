Several posters have recently dismissed homeopathy as quackery.  I'm responding
as someone who uses it as part of a repertoire of medical strategies, after
initially viewing
<br>
it with extreme skepticism.

<p>
<a name="1545qlink1">I notice that all the anti-homeopathy comments seem to be from U.S.
posters.   In the 19th 
<br>
and early 20th centuries, homeopathy was in wide use throughout the U.S.,
largely because
<br>
it had higher survival rates for epidemics than allopathic (conventional)
</a>
medicine.  The AMA
<br>
<a name="1545qlink2">was formed by allopathic physicians, who were concerned about their loss of
patients to
</a>
<br>
homeopaths.  They then used the power of the state to legislate a monopoly
for themselves,
<br>
and waged a fierce and successful campaign to vanquish homeopathy.

<p>
<a name="1545qlink3">Homeopathy has came back to wider use in the U.S. of late because of wide
distrust of the 
<br>
medical establishment, the holistic slant of homeopathy, how cheap (pennies
</a>
a dose) and safe 
<br>
(no side-effects ever) remedies<a name="1545qlink4"> are, and its effectiveness in treating
conditions that allopathic 
</a>
<br>
medicine can only provide symptomatic relief for.  

<p>
<a name="1641qlink1">While there has past been criticism of homeopathy in other countries, it is
now considered part 
<br>
of conventional medicine in many countries whose technology and medicine we
respect --
<br>
such as France, Germany, and the UK -- as well as those we in the U.S. view
</a>
more dubiously,
<br>
like India and Brazil.

<p>
The British royal family is treated by a homeopathic physician.  Mother
Teresa's clinics are
<br>
homeopathic.  I understand that ambulances in France routinely use both
allopathic and 
<br>
homeopathic approaches in combination -- e.g., treat shock with MAST
trousers and with Aconite.

<p>
The criticisms that I had myself were:

<p>
<a name="1500qlink1">(1)  Guilt by association.  People that talk about homeopathy are usually
the same 
<br>
non-rational people who talk about crystals, auras, astrology, and past
lives.  I am extremely
<br>
skeptical about the validity of whatever new thing they babble on about
this week.  My time
<br>
is too precious to examine an idea whose only supporters are such people.</a>

<p>
<a name="1500qlink2">(2)  The notion that the more diluted a substance was, the more potent it
is seemed 
<br>
ludicrous to me.  Homeopathic remedies are often used in potencies where
likely not a
<br>
single molecule of the original substance remains.  I've</a> heard explanations
by physicists of
<br>
<a name="1500qlink3">supposed mechanisms for how it works, but I am not convinced.</a> 

<p>
<a name="1500qlink4">But: the real question is "Does it work?"  

<p>
Beyond my own family's successes in treatment of chronic health concerns,
tens to hundreds 
<br>
of millions of satisfied patients, and double-blind studies in Nature and
Lancet, what really
<br>
convinced me that homeopathy was legitimate was personally seeing it
succeed in contexts 
<br>
where there could be no placebo effect -- the treatment of horses, dogs,
and babies.

<p>
I'd be happy to cite studies or to elaborate, but my real concern is the
dismissive tone of
<br>
the postings.  It reminds me too much of the way the rest of the world
dismisses 
<br>
libertarianism as unrealistic and nanotechnology as fantasy.</a>
