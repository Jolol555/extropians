&gt;&gt; How is this "worse," as opposed to an

&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; Anything associated with Rifkin is likely to

<a href="4436.html#4445qlink2">&gt; Hi Brian. That's the main issue that makes</a><br>
<i>&gt; this "worse". The suit is being brough</i><br>

<p>
Annoying, and very suspicious, yes. But, one can "shoot the
messenger" and then assess the message, if I may.

<p>
The message is one of the dangers of monopolies, a very
important message.

<p>
&gt;&gt; Is it, then, that we should put up with
&gt;&gt; monopolies in order to advance high tech?

<p>
<a href="4436.html#4445qlink3">&gt; Monopolies aren't a bad thing in and of</a><br>
<i>&gt; themselves. Monopolies are only bad when their</i><br>
<i>&gt; presence is a barrier to competition, preventing</i><br>

<i>&gt; doesn't seem to be the case here.</i><br>

<p>
Perhaps not. What I know of the issue, however, suggests
otherwise -- not that the jury is in of course. But this is part
of the point of antitrust laws: let's not wait until a sector of
the economy has been screwed up by a monopoly (or oligopoly); we
can take preventive action.

<p>
<a href="4436.html#4445qlink4">&gt; The small farmers are a different case. The only</a><br>
<i>&gt; reason they still exist is because of America's</i><br>
<i>&gt; romanticized attachment to our history as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; nation of small farmers. Unfortunately, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; family farm is about as useful to the modern</i><br>
<i>&gt; economy as Buggy Whips, Inc.</i><br>

<p>
Measures of the Good extend beyond economic utility and
efficiency. (Not to suggest a ham-fisted libertarianism on your
part -- you're clearly too well-educated for that.)

<p>
Of course, none of this means price supports or other forms of
assistance are needed to shore up American family farms.
Avoiding monopolies among agribusinesses seems justified,
however.

<p>
(And speaking of libertarianism, don't libertarians actually
LIKE decentralization? -- Never mind that most of the
libertarian arguments for decentralization originated with
French _socialists_....)
