Abstract
<br>
  OBJECTIVES: This study assesses the relationship of body
  mass index to 5-year
<br>
  mortality in a cohort of 4317 nonsmoking men and women aged
  65 to 100 years. METHODS: Logistic regression analyses were conducted to
  predict mortality as a function of baseline
  body mass index, adjusting
<br>
  for demographic, clinical, and laboratory covariates. RESULTS: There was an
  inverse relationship between body mass
  index and mortality; death rates were
<br>
  higher for those who weighed the least. Inclusion of covariates had trivial
  effects on these results. People who had lost 10% or more of their
  body weight since age 50 had a relatively high death rate.
  When that group was excluded, there was no remaining relationship between
  body mass index and
<br>
  mortality. CONCLUSIONS: The association between higher
  body mass index and
<br>
  mortality often found in middle-aged populations was not
  observed in this large cohort of older adults. Over-weight does not seem to
  be a risk factor for 5-year mortality in this age group.
  Rather, the risks associated with significant weight loss should be the
  primary concern.
