I wasn't thinking about reporting at all (any reporting mechanisms
will be most likely eliminated by mutation before long). Feedback
could be as simple as catching a few specimens on the Net, and
dissecting them. In case of emergence of the more complex individua
one could eavesdrop on their traffic/communicate with them directly.

A worm infection could fortify the affected system against such future
attacks (e.g. by patching the constructive buffer overrun
hole). Everything within the worm should be mutable, which makes
scanning for them impossible (and prevents vaccination).

Crashes are inevitable if you breed machine code which is run outside
of virtual machine sandboxes.
