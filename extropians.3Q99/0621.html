Whoa, Mike, hold your horses. Math per se does not exist but in the
minds/machines of its practicioners (though zealots may argue 
otherwise). There might be other self-consistent formal systems 
in use Out There, or maybe no formal systems at all -- just idiot 
savant-like "knowing". Or something else entirely, something we have
yet no idea of.

All very interesting, but what if the aliens don't at all have the
concept of numbers? Or equations?

This is no more abstruse than your assertion that they indeed do have
all these properties.

<a href="0611.html#0621qlink3"> &gt; can use a base of e (the natural log), or we can use pi as a base</a><br>

<i> &gt; among primitive societies. </i><br>
 
<p>
All apparently plausible assumptions -- alas, extrapolated on the
basis of exactly one instance -- us. Sorry, not convinced.

<a href="0611.html#0621qlink4"> &gt; If the ancient maya or egyptians had had radio telescopes, they could be</a><br>
<i> &gt; communicated with quite easily by an advanced intelligence via math.</i><br>

<p>
We know Mayans and Egyptians, or, at least, we know our images of
them. They are all people, temporally not terribly distant from us. 
Comparing them to postsingularitarian supercivilisations (because 
that's the only kind of civilisations with high enough temporal 
depth for us-current to bump into them with any probability) is 
terribly oversimplistic.

<a href="0611.html#0621qlink5"> &gt; Communicating via math does not require that we learn their maths, but</a><br>
<i> &gt; that they will communicate via simply understandable maths, much like EO</i><br>
<i> &gt; Wilson playing with pheromones to talk to ants.</i><br>

<p>
So far, nobody seems to have seen us/want to communicate. Our 
problem is to find the aliens by their metabolism signatures they 
cannot avoid, by grand-scale artefacts they cannot possibly conceal. 
Whether they are there or not -- both possibilities are very
intriguing. Either the visible universe is ours to claim -- which 
will require much better tech than we currently have, or, we will 
soon face the task of communicating with extremely advanced 
extraterrestrials -- which will very probably require us to be 
postsingularitarian/one of them. No sense people talking to
nematodes.
