[I think I emailed this personally instead of to the list.
My apologies if it appears twice.]

<p>
<a href="1495.html#1545qlink1">&gt; I notice that all the anti-homeopathy comments seem to be from</a><br>
<i>&gt; U.S. posters.   In the 19th and early 20th centuries, homeopathy</i><br>
<i>&gt; was in wide use throughout the U.S., largely because it had</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher survival rates for epidemics than allopathic (conventional)</i><br>
<i>&gt; medicine.</i><br>

<p>
Please document this claim.  It might be that during some
particular epidemic for which the statistics were gathered, the
traditional medical approach to treatment was actually harmful
(that's quite likely, in fact).  Since homepathy does nothing,
it's not harmful and would therefore show better results.  It
might also be something like a statistical correlation between
the proportion of homeopaths to doctors in an area and survival
rates in that area; if so, that could be explained away simply
by noting that homepaths go where the money is, and wealthy
communities are cleaner and healthier.

<p>
<a name="1594qlink1"><a href="1495.html#1545qlink2">&gt; The AMA was formed by allopathic physicians, who were concerned</a><br>
<i>&gt; about their loss of patients to homeopaths.</i><br>

<p>
Probably true.  That says nothing about the effectiveness of
homeopathy, just the greed of doctors.</a>

<p>
<a href="1495.html#1545qlink3">&gt; Homeopathy has came back to wider use in the U.S. of late</a><br>
<i>&gt; because of wide distrust of the medical establishment, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; holistic slant of homeopathy, how cheap (pennies a dose)...</i><br>

<p>
All marketing reasons, not medical ones.

<p>
&gt;... and safe (no side-effects ever) remedies are,...

<p>
True.  No effects=no side-effects.  /Any/ medication that actually
does something /will/ have side-effects.  That's the very
nature of evolved systems like bio-organisms: nothing has just
one function and everything is connected.  If you cause a change
somewhere, something else will change as well.

<p>
<a name="1594qlink2"><a href="1495.html#1545qlink4">&gt; and its effectiveness in treating conditions that allopathic </a><br>
<i>&gt; medicine can only provide symptomatic relief</a> for.  </i><br>

<p>
<a name="1594qlink3">An empty claim that no one has proved, despite decades of
</a>attempts.  

<p>
&gt; [More meaningless drivel about popularity, how some famous<br>
&gt; people use it, blah blah]<br>

<p>
Science is nothing but precise, methodical, honesty.  The
claims of homeopaths are not merely unproven, they are willfully
dishonest.  Everyone with even the slightest knowledge of how
the human body works knows how to properly test a drug: with
a double-blind trial.<a name="1594qlink4">  Homeopathic remedies have been tested
and failed every double-blind trial ever done for them.</a>  Anyone
who tries to promote remedies has to dodge that fact, or invent
other excuses for it, or direct the listener away from it.
They must carefully avoid the dreaded word "placebo" because to
educate the buying public with that knowledge would cause them
to lose their market.  Most probably have to be dishonest with
themselves as well, convincing themselves that all the simple
proof that their water is just water is somehow flawed, or that
the placebo effect isn't really as powerful as it is known to be.
If they didn't kid themselves, their conscience would prey upon
them as surely as they prey upon the weak and gullible.

<p>
Traditional medicine has lots of problems, but it has one great
redeeming feature that homeopathy lacks: when they find something
doesn't work, eventually (sometimes after years) they stop doing
it.  Because while single doctors may not be, the scientific
community as a whole is open-minded and honest enough to admit its
failures and to change.<a name="1594qlink5">  The homeopathic community continues to
use Hahnemann's books as a bible despite decades of progress by
</a>
medical science.  When Hahnemann wrote them, childhood leukemia
was a death sentence.  Breast cancer was a death sentence.  No
exceptions.  Today, most survive.  That didn't happen because of
distilled water; it happened because of chemotherapy and radiation.
But if homepaths had their way, they'd continue to treat those
people with water, and continue to watch them die.
