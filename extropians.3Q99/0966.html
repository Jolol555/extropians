Of course it doesn't.

In the case of SPSR, this may indeed have been the case, but if</a> it was it was 
<a name="0970qlink3">for the wrong reasons.  Also, if reputable groups are humoring SPSR (an 
organization with several members who _don't_ endorse any sort of ET 
explanation), then this "humoring" has gone all the way to NASA and JPL.</a>  It 
<a name="0970qlink4">was SPSR's thoughtful, nonpartisan approach that got NASA to take the new 
pictures (and now, suddenly, even more pictures that aren't being hyped).</a>  It 
<a name="0970qlink5">was SPSR who first discovered ice in Cydonia: a significant find, even</a> if it 
<a name="0970qlink6">has nothing to do with ETI.  NASA's certainly taking _that_ discovery 
seriously enough.

<p>
SPSR isn't a bunch of nuts, just some qualifed and curious scientists of 
various disciplines.  Don't take my word for it; do your own homework.</a>

<p>
<a href="0962.html#0966qlink4">&gt;Oh, NASA and other scientists are faced quite often with the dilemma</a><br>

<p>
Nothing particularly new here...

<p>
<a href="0962.html#0966qlink5">&gt;Often, they are simply too busy to do much, so they ignore it.</a><br>

<p>
Which is often the prudent thing to do.

<p>
<a name="0970qlink7"><a href="0962.html#0966qlink6">&gt;And even more importantly, those that have large decision-making</a><br>

<p>
This is a serious issue with real implications re. the democratization of 
space science data.  My stand is that science is anyone's game, and the 
"referees" should be as hands-off as possible.  Unfortunately, we live in a 
culture with absolutely awful science literacy.  This</a> is a worthwhile topic; 
<a name="0970qlink8">I can see a whole new thread emerging from</a> it.

<p>
<a href="0962.html#0966qlink7">&gt;Last year a poster by Hoagland made it into the poster displays of</a><br>
<i>&gt;the annual Division of Planetary Sciences meeting. The poster was</i><br>
<i>&gt;displayed alongside the other scientific results of Mars research.</i><br>

<p>
Hoagland has been a big disappointment to me.  I read the first edition of 
his "The Monuments of Mars" and was impressed; it's an excellent piece of 
_speculative_ science writing, with a lot of ideas and a good grounding in 
then-contemporary Mars research.  Back then, Hoagland was able to 
differentiate speculation from fact, which, sadly, he is unable to do now.

<p>
But what are you going to do?  Let Hoagland drag the whole subject into the 
mud with his conspiracy blather?  A subject like this attracts cranks and 
paranoids.  I don't think there's any getting around it.
