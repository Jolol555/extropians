Chris Fedeli:
<br>
<a href="2923.html#2944qlink1">&gt;You can bet that if we ever become important enough to get sound bytes on</a><br>
the six &gt;o' clock news the press will never fail to include a reference to
our shockingly &gt;dated demographics in their description of transhumanists.
I can hear it already &gt;:  "The spokesperson for the Extropy Institute, a
group that is comprised 99% of &gt;white males, made the following statement...."

<p>
<a name="2973qlink1">They might get that far, but they are definitely going to pick on the
interview subjects first.  A few weeks ago, I completed a round of
'hotseat' training,</a> where the trainers put you in front of a camera, under
the hot lights, and pepper you with hard questions to answer.  I have grey
eyes and blonde hair, and this became an issue immediately.   Rough
transcript:

<p>
&lt;Kathryn sits on stool, camerman does adustments&gt;

<p>
ME:  ok, I'm ready

<p>
&lt;snickers in back of room&gt;

<p>
ME:  What?

<p>
AUDIENCE:  Nothing.

<p>
INTERVIEWER:  I'm going to ask a few questions about cloning, which is a
hot topic these days.

<p>
&lt;laughter in back of room&gt;

<p>
ME:  WHAT?

<p>
<a name="2956qlink1">BACK OF ROOM:  You look like the Aryan Martha Stewart.  

<p>
TRAINER:  It might be good if you didn't talk about genetics, cloning, or
anything else that might bring up the image of a 'master race'.....</a>
