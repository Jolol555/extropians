"Silly" isn't the word I'd use.  "Amateurish", maybe.  I would describe
egoism as awareness of the matrix of social obligations and culturally
imposed morality that is usually taken for granted, thus making
participation a matter of conscious decision; but NOT awareness of, or
freedom from, the evolutionarily imposed morality and preconceptions
that egoists take for granted to the point of identifying with them.

<p>
I suppose it really is silly to the likes of you and I - watching
someone declare their freedom from all arbitrary restrictions with moral
force and social conviction, shouting it in fury in a tone of voice
preprogrammed by the limbic system - but it's a pretty high-level
sillyness.  I'd call it irony rather than sillyness per se.

True only up to a point - as I said recently, there's a distinction
<a name="1773qlink1">between what you can do with software and what you can do with hardware.</a></a>
 On the other hand, the matrix of interactions between emotions and the
world-model is intricate enough that you can do virtually anything by
tinkering with the world-model, which *is* under conscious control.  So
<a name="1767qlink2">purposes, if not energy and short-term motivations, definitely fall into

big book" leads one to attribute causality to the book, instead of to
the preconditions.  You might say that even if all our choices are
pre-written in some big book, we are the writing.</a>
