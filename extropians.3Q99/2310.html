&gt;     &gt;This points up an ambiguity in the MWI, which is, when do other universes
&gt;     &gt;exist?  That is, when does the universe split?  You can give two answers.
&gt;     &gt;One is that it splits whenever there is an alternative which is explored
&gt;     &gt;in the quantum realm.  The other is that it splits whenever there is
&gt;     &gt;a measurement which causes what would conventionally be called wave
&gt;     &gt;function collapse.
&gt;
&gt; I've never heard of that second version of the MWI before, I always
&gt; thought it's entire advantage was that it didn't have to explain what
&gt; a measurement is.

<p>
As an example of the second interpretation, see the Many-Worlds FAQ,
<a href="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~fjh/many-worlds-faq.html:">http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/~fjh/many-worlds-faq.html:</a>

<i>: Q7   When do worlds split?</i><br>
<i>:      ---------------------</i><br>
<i>: Worlds irrevocably "split" at the sites of measurement-like interactions</i><br>
<i>: associated with thermodynamically irreversible processes.  (See "What</i><br>
<a name="2838qlink3"><i>: is a measurement?")  An irreversible process</a> will always produce</i><br>
<i>: decoherence which splits worlds.  (See "Why do worlds split?", "What is</i><br>
<i>: decoherence?" and "When does Schrodinger's cat split?" for a concrete</i><br>
<i>: example.)</i><br>
<i>: [...]</i><br>
<i>: The advantage of linking the definition of worlds and the splitting</i><br>
<i>: process with thermodynamics is the splitting process becomes</i><br>
: irreversible and only permits forward-time-branching, following the<br>
: increase with entropy.  (See "Why don't worlds fuse, as well as split?") <br>

<p>
John's version is the second one above, Mike Price's (author of the FAQ)
is the first.  Both versions are fairly widely used.
