NOTE: this is NOT an advertisement but information concerning
 a new search engine that I hope will prove very
useful to List members in their endless search for Truth.

The GOOGLE search engine, after its long Beta period, is
now fully operational.  You have to use it to discover its
BOT-like intelligence and the amazing relevance and usability
 of its results. There is even a "I'm feeling lucky"
button that returns only one link to your query, and in
my experimentation quite often the site provides just that
information you were looking for.

<p>
Its operational status was reported to me by "Netsurfer
Digest" who gives it a rave review:

<p>
    "Google represents the best available information
    management technology and is a must-have bookmark
     for everyone."
