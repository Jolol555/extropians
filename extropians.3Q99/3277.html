<a href="3273.html#3277qlink1">&gt; I just joined this list recently, but I do not see a lot of what I would</a><br>
<i>&gt; I call "naive technophiles". I do see a lot of technophiles, and a lot</i><br>

<p>
"Seems" is the glaringly operative word here.
Yep, you're a naive technophile, all right.

<p>
Look at it this way:  One person can take controlled sips from a tidal
wave.  A thousand people can't.  Neither can two competitors.

<p>
&gt; Technology can do anything.<br>

<p>
And it probably will, whether you want it or not.

<p>
<a name="3335qlink1"><a href="3273.html#3277qlink2">&gt; But thought about * why*  taking a controlled sip from a tidal</a><br>
<i>&gt; wave is a worthwhile goal seems to be absent from this list.</i><br>

<a href="3273.html#3277qlink3">&gt; Seems important to think about these things. Is anyone here worried</a><br>
<i>&gt; about slipping into a psychosis of nihilism once their IQs are high</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough that they realize that their goals have no philosophical</i><br>
<i>&gt; foundation (or *might* have no foundation)?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3336qlink2">I suppose in theory I shouldn't worry about going nuts if I find out
<a name="3329qlink1">that there are no ultimate goals, because then my going nuts wouldn't
intrinsically be worse than not going nuts.</a>  In practice, I do worry
about it, partially because it sheds light on the "foundations of the
foundations", partially because it helps me locate residual desires,
partially because I'm still not sure I have the right formulation of
anything,<a name="3336qlink3"> and partially because it's tied up with cosmological problems
like the Great Filter Paradox.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3336qlink4">In any case, I've already designed a philosophical foundation for
transhumans and the initial stages of AIs.  A fraction of that is in the
link above.  So yes, the problem has occurred to me, and I took care</a> of it.

<p>
<a href="3273.html#3277qlink4">&gt; Worrying about grey goo seems less important (and less interesting) than</a><br>
<i>&gt; worrying about 400 IQ nihilists with a *lot* of technological power.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3336qlink5">Only *incorrect* nihilists.  If the nihilists are correct, then it's
obviously meaningless whether we worry or not.</a>
