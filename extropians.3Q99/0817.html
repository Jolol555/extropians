<i>&gt; The thing is, the definition of light is inherently circular.  Once</i><br>

<i>&gt; reference to a "second", and you've automatically defined a "second" by</i><br>
<i>&gt; reference to the speed of light.  After all, there's really no such</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing as separate units of "space" and "time".  If you rotate a unit of</i><br>
<i>&gt; time (a "second") by 90 degrees, it becomes a unit of space (299,792,458</i><br>
meters).

<p>
Yes, but you can (and need) to define second in independent manner, or else
you'll end up not defining anything.
<br>
If you only say that x=ay and that y=x/a and give a a set value you don't
now anything about x or y. They could be any value at all. That's what you
end up with your circular definition of light.
Since the SI seems to know better than that they define a second as "the
duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the
transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the
cesium 133 atom".

<p>
<a href="0812.html#0817qlink2">&gt; Trying to have a non-circular definition is like trying to have a</a><br>
<i>&gt; non-circular way to convert units of "height" into units of "width".</i><br>
<i>&gt; They're the same thing.  You may live in some weirdo fantasy universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; where you define height and width by entirely different measures, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; that "height" is measured in inches by reference to the height of</i><br>
<i>&gt; Nelson's Column, while "width" is measured in meters by reference to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; circumference of the planet, and you use special sloping rulers to</i><br>
<i>&gt; convert between them - but the fact is, height and width are the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; thing, and no conversions are necessary; the debate about how to</i><br>
<i>&gt; "define" these measurements in terms of each other is silly, you're just</i><br>
<i>&gt; taking too many measurements.</i><br>

<p>
Well, that would be all fine and dandy, except that time isn't just another
dimension of space. As you might have noticed it is a dimension of time.
There are some similarities but there are also many differences.

<p>
<a href="0812.html#0817qlink3">&gt; The speed of light is equal to one.  Any unit of time defines a unit of</a><br>
<i>&gt; length, and vice versa; you just multiply by the speed of light, which</i><br>
<i>&gt; could as easily be phrased as "one second per 299,792,458 meters".</i><br>

<p>
You can define c to equal 1 (and that's what they do in that unitary units,
or whatever it is called, system) which can be handy for several purposes
(notably E=mc^2 turns into E=m, and some other simplifications) but that is
still just as a convention as saying it to be 299,792,458 meters per second,
or PI^sqrt(-35) yorts per tar.
