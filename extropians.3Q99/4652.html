*Stem cells may be powerful gene shuttle<br>
Stem cells may be a better shuttle than viruses for delivering corrective
genes to tissues throughout the body, say HHMI researchers. The study hints
that adults may harbor stem cells from a variety of organs and tissues that
might be manipulated to heal genetic defects in organs and tissues
throughout the body.    <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/news/stemcell.htm">http://www.hhmi.org/news/stemcell.htm</a>

Due to be replaced in October 1999, this exhibition represents a succinct
selection of UK-published science titles covering subject areas that promise
to impact the future. A section on Award-winning Books features books for
both children and adults that have won or been short-listed for a major
award. For example, last year's winner of the Science Book Prize, The
Consumer's Good Chemical Guide, is described here. Other sections include
Biotechnology and Bioscience, Information and Communication Technology,
Public Understanding of Science, and Science Policy and Exploitation.
Depending on the section, titles are aimed at both professional and general
audiences.

*Evidence that a free-running oscillator drives G1 events in the budding<br>
yeast cell cycle
<br>
STEVEN B. HAASE AND STEVEN I. REED (nature)
In yeast and somatic cells, mechanisms ensure cell-cycle events are
initiated only when preceding events have been completed. In contrast,
interruption of specific cell-cycle processes in early embryonic cells of
many organisms does not affect the timing of subsequent events, indicating
that cell-cycle events are triggered by a free-running cell-cycle
oscillator. Here we present evidence for an independent cell-cycle
oscillator in the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We observed
periodic activation of events normally restricted to the G1 phase of the
cell cycle, in cells lacking mitotic cyclin-dependent kinase activities that
are essential for cell-cycle progression. As in embryonic cells, G1 events
cycled on schedule, in the absence of S phase or mitosis, with a period
similar to the cell-cycle time of wild-type cells. Oscillations of similar
periodicity were observed in cells responding to mating pheromone in the
absence of G1 cyclin (Cln)- and mitotic cyclin (Clb)-associated kinase
activity, indicating that the oscillator may function independently of
cyclin-dependent kinase dynamics. We also show that Clb-associated kinase
activity is essential for ensuring dependencies by preventing the initiation
of new G1 events when cell-cycle progression is delayed.

*Earthquake hits computer chip plants, world prices may rise. The Taiwan<br>
earthquake means computer-chip makers will lose up to two weeks of
production and could lead to an increase in worldwide prices, analysts said
Wednesday.  The quake knocked out power at most companies in the the Hsinchu
Science-based Technology Park. By Wednesday morning, only partial power had
been restored to several leading chipmakers there. The U.S. investment firm
[ Merrill Lynch ] said in a report that Tuesday's deadly quake would affect
output for one to one and a half weeks.
<br>
Taiwan is expected to account for 10 percent of global production in value
terms this year, the report said.

  <li>  Leading article: The gene machine Research which must not be privatised
(The Guardian)
If they succeed in negotiating an Anglo-American agreement to ensure that
gene patents are freely available worldwide to combat diseases, rather than
being snapped up by patent-seeking entrepreneurs, then Tony Blair and Bill
Clinton will have done a service to humanity. Most people, understandably,
still find it difficult to get their minds around the fact that the problem
exists in the first place. Multinational companies are trying to take out
patents over the genes or fragments of genes that control the human body.
They are hijacking one of the principles of the US constitution for
`promoting the useful arts and sciences': this allows inventors to exclude
others from pirating their inventions for up to 20 years. That is fine for
products and new drugs, but not for the `blueprints of life'. The author
Jeremy Rifkin has called this debate `one of the most important issues ever
to face the human family'.{QQ} It is wrong both in principle and in
practice. If the patents are monopolised by large (mainly American)
corporations, small companies will be shut out of the innovation race and
exploitation of the benefits will - as with GM foods - follow a fierce US
corporate agenda. The needs of the rest of the globe will be swept aside in
the process. If gene patenting were privatised it would be possible for
someone holding the rights to a DNA fragment to retard the development of
vibrant new products making use of lots of fragments. One of the biggest
worries is the entrepreneur scientist Craig Venter, whose company, Celera,
is rushing to patent as many human genes as possible. Entrepreneurs have a
vital role in any economy in starting companies, but not in making money out
of something that most people in the world justifiably regard as public
property. All research on human genes should be released to the world
without patent protection. This is one area where mutualism must triumph
over the serial patent hunters. {QQ}
