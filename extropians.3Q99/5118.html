Hello everyone,

<p>
I have really enjoyed the discussion between Natasha and Muse about the 
nature of art for itself and as a vocation.  With all the engineering talk 
around here it is nice to hear from people who are interested both in art 
and science.  I realize that person grounded in the "hard sciences" such as 
engineering could still be very artistic or at least appreciative of such 
and so do not wish to stereotype.  I just found it very refreshing to have 
the subject of art, self and culture discussed in a prominent way.

<p>
<a name="5214qlink1">My question for everyone is were you to come into a great deal of money and 
create your own club/restaurant in the present day how would you go about 
it??  The building architecture?  What would the interior decor be like?  
The dress of employees?</a>

<p>
<a name="5186qlink1"><a name="5185qlink1"><a name="5141qlink1">And let's say you were reanimated after a long cryonic sleep in the early 
22nd century only to learn the investments you owned while in storage had 
made you very rich!  With the incredible technologies(and changed social 
</a>
mores) available then how would you create your dream club??</a></a>

<p>
I look forward to the replies!  Considering the imaginations and intellects 
here it could be indeed interesting!

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
