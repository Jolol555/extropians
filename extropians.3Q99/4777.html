	Yes, Roger Dean is fantastic...his artwork is half of the reason I bought
_Tales From Topographic Oceans_.  (Yes is the other half, of course).

<p>
	My "nan-city" could never stay as one particular form or shape...I would
always want it to mold itself around my moods, emotions or frame of mind
--perhaps regulated by a neural network?  I would love nothing more than to
be able to hear a constant flow of music to match my thoughts...written by
my stream of consciousness, or even the collective subconsciousness of my
city's inhabitants.

<p>
	There is one thing, though, I could not tolerate in a nan-city, which
would be lack of production and industry.  Given such possibilities as are
manifested by nanotech, it might become easy to revel in the "present" when
that time comes.  However, my nan-city would have to be a productive one,
using technology to push all envelopes forward.  In fact, the ideal city
(for me) would be less a city than a spacecraft to explore the galaxy.
That is the beauty of our future: one day, science will be so like art, and
art so like science, that it will be impossible and superfluous to
distinguish one from the other.
