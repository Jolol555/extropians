Abstract
<br>
  Female Sencar mice (6 weeks old) were administered 1 mg of
  7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) by oral gavage once a week for 5 weeks.
  At 20 weeks after the first dose of DMBA, 68% of mice developed mammary
  tumors (the average 1.08 tumors per mouse) and 45% had lymphomas/leukemias.
  Feeding 1% dibenzoylmethane (DBM) in AIN 76A diet, starting
  at 2 weeks before the first dose of DMBA and continuing until the end of the
  experiment, inhibited both the multiplicity and incidence of DMBA-induced
  mammary tumor by 97%. The incidence of lymphomas/leukemias was completely
  inhibited by 1% DBM diet. In contrast, feeding 2% curcumin diet had little or
  no effect on the incidence of mammary tumors, and the incidence of
  lymphomas/leukemias was reduced by 53%.

Abstract
<br>
  Curcumin is a beta-diketone constituent of the spice turmeric that possesses
  anticarcinogenic properties in several animal models. The present studies
  were conducted in order to identify beta-diketones structurally-related to
  curcumin that would be effective dietary blocking agents toward the
  initiation stage of 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced rat mammary
  carcinogenesis. Of the beta-diketone compounds initially screened for their
  capacity to induce quinone-reductase (QR) activity in wild-type Hepa1c1c7
  cells and a mutant subclone, curcumin (diferuloylmethane) and
  dibenzoylmethane were most effective. However, when added to
  semipurified diets fed to female rats, dibenzoylmethane
  (1%), but not curcumin (1%), was effective in inhibiting in vivo mammary
  DMBA-DNA adduct formation. This inhibitory effect on mammary adduct formation
  was associated with a significant increase in liver activities of glutathione
  S-transferase, QR and 7-ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase activities. Female rats
  provided diets supplemented with dibenzoylmethane at 0.1,
  0.5 and 1.0% for 14 days prior to dosing with DMBA exhibited a significant
  decrease in mammary tumor development, compared with controls. However, tumor
  development for animals fed diets containing 1.0% curcumin was not different
  from that of controls. Therefore, dibenzoylmethane, and
  possibly other structurally-related beta-diketones, warrant examination as
  breast cancer chemopreventative blocking agents.
