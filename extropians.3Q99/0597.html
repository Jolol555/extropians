<a name="0601qlink1">Up till this I had been in two minds about whether to go for head-only
or full-body suspension. It now seems that full-body is the better
option, warranting the extra cost. Thanks.</a>

This is a great day for me for at least three reasons:
1. I got a sensible response from someone on the Extropians list.
2. The Alexa traffic ranking for our website &lt;<a href="http://www.buildfreedom.com/">http://www.buildfreedom.com/</a>&gt;
is up to #13,783, meaning that there are only 12,782 websites that get more
traffic. [&lt;<a href="http://www.free-market.net/">http://www.free-market.net/</a>&gt; ranks #23,891;
&lt;<a href="http://www.self-gov.org/">http://www.self-gov.org/</a>&gt;
<br>
(Advocates for Self-Government) ranks #30,360; &lt;<a href="http://www.lp.org/">http://www.lp.org/</a>&gt;
(National Libertarian Party) ranks #30,859; &lt;<a href="http://www.extropy.com/~exi/">http://www.extropy.com/~exi/</a>&gt;
ranks #49,280.]

that he can communicate effectively about it.

<i>&gt;  It is interesting to note how pervasive the limiting and enslaving </i><br>
<i>&gt;conceptual paradigm I shall call "civilization" truly is, even in the realm </i><br>
<i>&gt;of ideas aimed at escaping or waking up from this "civilization". Various </i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom "philosophies" abound- for many of us, these seemingly radical ideas </i><br>
<i>&gt;were the first indicators that "civilization" is evil. "Libertarianism", </i><br>
<i>&gt;"Objectivism", "Patriotism", and almost all other freedom oriented </i><br>
<i>&gt;philosophies appear to help us leave the current "civilization" meta-model. </i><br>
<i>&gt;A quick example could illustrate how exactly the opposite might be possible. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Think back to "civilization": recall the activity identified as "voting". </i><br>
<i>&gt;You could "vote" Democrat, Republican, Libertarian, or for some other </i><br>
<i>&gt;"independent" wanna-be bureaucrat. Or you could not vote at all. Now </i><br>
<i>&gt;consider: which option truly furthers your freedom? Some might argue that </i><br>
<i>&gt;you should at least vote Libertarian. Most on this list might consider not </i><br>
<i>&gt;voting at all as the best route.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Consider the possibility that there is no such thing as "voting"! You can </i><br>
<i>&gt;go inside a box and make a few check marks on a piece of paper (or pull some </i><br>
<i>&gt;levers); but what does this mean? Absolutely nothing, unless you view your </i><br>
<i>&gt;actions from the context of the "civilization" paradigm. How would you </i><br>
<i>&gt;explain that these check marks on paper constitute "votes" to an alien? The </i><br>
<i>&gt;very concepts which we employ internally to describe our selves and the </i><br>
<i>&gt;world we create/perceive are the basis of the "civilization" we are vaguely </i><br>
<i>&gt;aware of and are trying to escape. Debating "voting", "laws", "philosophy", </i><br>
<i>&gt;what is "right", or any number of absurdities only further ensconces your </i><br>
<i>&gt;mind in an illusory "civilization". </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Back to "Libertarianism", "Objectivism" and the lot: the root concepts </i><br>
<i>&gt;used to formulate these conceptual constructs only serve to continually </i><br>
<i>&gt;enforce the "civilization" they aim to alter or avoid. It is possible that </i><br>
<i>&gt;the level-1 freedom ideas that seem to be such beacons of clarity and hope </i><br>
<i>&gt;at one point might actually be the most difficult hooks and blindspots to </i><br>
<i>&gt;engage. These are the ideas that led many to consider the possibility of </i><br>
<i>&gt;freedom, and as such, carry a great emotional, and perhaps intellectual, </i><br>
<i>&gt;value to some. When you are determined not to "vote", you cannot see that </i><br>
<i>&gt;"voting" exists only as an illusory and false construct in your mind....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;   Freespeak involves much more than simply ceasing to use certain concepts </i><br>
<i>&gt;as if they were valid (IMHO). It is the personal creation of a new internal, </i><br>
<i>&gt;descriptive lexicon. It is perhaps the ultimate unlearning/learning process. </i><br>
<i>&gt;To employ Freespeak internally might require a complete evaluation of </i><br>
<i>&gt;perception, and then a new mode of thought, built with a bottom-up approach </i><br>
<i>&gt;from this fresh perceptual perspective. The written and auditory symbolism </i><br>
<i>&gt;we use store and convey this new conceptual model might resemble the </i><br>
<i>&gt;language of "civilization", but the associated concepts cannot remain the </i><br>
<i>&gt;same. Freespeak might not simply be a new and different paradigm to replace </i><br>
<i>&gt;the "civilization" paradigm; what we refer to as Freespeak might be the </i><br>
<i>&gt;absence of paradigms, as our minds have evolved to function. </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Best regards,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mike Williams</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; for head-only cryonic suspension?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Head-only cryonic suspension has always been dubious (beyond the</i><br>

<i>&gt;"thinking with the heart" story is almost certainly a meaningless</i><br>
<i>&gt;extrapolation from a small discovery motivated by mysticism, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;that doesn't mean all such notions are nonsense.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The idea that "brains think, hearts just pump" is a black-and</i><br>
<i>&gt;white dichotomy of function characteristic of designed systems,</i><br>
<i>&gt;not evolved systems.  Evolved systems don't work like that; every</i><br>
<i>&gt;part interferes with every other part, everything has multiple</i><br>
<i>&gt;functions and side effects, and everything works together for</i><br>
<i>&gt;hard-to-see reasons, because that's just how it evolved.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The properly skeptical viewpoint is that we cannot yet rule out</i><br>
<i>&gt;the possibility that some interesting part of who we are exists</i><br>
<i>&gt;below the neck.  We have made a few observations: amputees can</i><br>
<i>&gt;still speak and reason, so we can say with some confidence that</i><br>
<i>&gt;it is very unlikely that some part of language and reason is</i><br>
<i>&gt;perfomed in the limbs.  Heart transplant patients wake up thinking</i><br>
<i>&gt;that they are the same people with similar thoughts.  But their</i><br>
<i>&gt;personalities certainly do change--as do all of ours every day--</i><br>
<i>&gt;and we have few ways to measure that or know how to find reasons</i><br>
<i>&gt;for it.</i><br>
