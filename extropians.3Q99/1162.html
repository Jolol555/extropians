  <li>  It was a question/request-for-documentation, more than a retort.

<p>
The word 'retort' implies that I was refuting your claim.  I know that
there is a dictionary definition that does not include this implication,
but I am refering to the more common usage, which does include such an
implication.  I'm just skeptical (but I would like to think in a
non-dogmatic way), and I don't believe people on such matters on a "trust
me" basis, especially when the assertions are contrary to the prevailing
consensus view.  I want some empirical evidence, which I happen to think is
a perfectly reasonable and rational attitude.  It certainly is an attitude
I would expect people to share on this list.  So please don't take offense,
because I'd like to believe your assertions, but I also need to be
convinced by some evidence.

<p>
2)  Unfortunately, the list archives (&lt;<a href="http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/">http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/</a>&gt;
is the link I get from ExI's homepage) only go up to 3Q 1998, so I could
not find your prior post by searching the archives.

<p>
Do you have another copy of your post in your "out" box, or somewhere on
your harddrive, that you could send me?  (Private email is fine).  Or some
other pointer?

<p>
<a name="1167qlink1">I will admit, however, that I am less interested in a "lengthy analysis of
the tax code" than in a simple citation (or four) for that list of four
categories of people required to file and/or pay income taxes.  I'm not
asking you to prove the negative that nobody besides those four categories
is required to file and/or pay (I know how hard that proof is, and I know
that that proving a negative does require a lengthy analysis to be at all
convincing, i.e., worthy of being assessed as "highly probable").

<p>
I just asked for simple citations that those four categories are required
to pay/file.  Those are positive assertions, and should be supportable with
specific citations to the U.S. tax code or the decision of an authoritative
court.  I can then fill in the common legal inference that "what is not
included is necessarily excluded" by myself.
