A friend of mine mentioned an idea he'd seen once.  Hurricanes move heat from 
water to the upper atmosphere - that's their main source of energy.  The idea 
is to deliver the heat to the upper atmosphere yourself, so the hurricane has 
nothing to use.

<p>
The proposal was to build 6-mile high vents and move air through them.  The 
dynamics apparently cause this to be an energy-producing process. 
Essentially, it works rather like a controlled thunderstorm. The article 
claimed to have worked through the economics and the technical details of 
building something so enormous.  The energy production would not be enought 
to pay for the cost of production, but if you added the energy produced to 
the insurance benefits to preventing hurricances, you have a winner.  As a 
side benefit, air at the ground gets cooler.  I suspect they did *not* 
address the issue of climate change from delivering such vast amounts of heat 
to the upper troposphere.

<p>
I'm sorry I can't provide a reference; I got this second-hand.
