&gt; Doug discussed the hazard function of rocket fuel testing<br>
&gt; and spike added a few words about misuses for dynamite.<br>

<a name="2659qlink1">Gee, I thought I was pretty bad with some gunpowder that
I could never figure out how pack properly (I didn't
understand that you needed only a little powder and a
very strong casing),</a> or the contact explosive that went
off one night in the cellar under my mothers bedroom
because the filter paper it was drying on decided to curl.

<p>
But you guys have got me beat.  But when I left my
propulsion methods to the pre-packaged engines,
my rockets *did* fly.  So if yall need any tips now,
well you just send ole Rob a note...

<a name="2650qlink1"><a name="2649qlink1">I think my grandfather (who was a science teacher) may
have been a match for you two.  He dumped about a
kilo of old sodium off of a bridge over the Charles
River in Boston many years ago.  The next day the
papers read "Charles River Boils"....
