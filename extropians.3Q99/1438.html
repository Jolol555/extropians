<a name="1631qlink1"><a name="1455qlink1">I liked James Gunn's "The Listeners" quite a bit; I thought</a> Sagan's "Contact" 
<a name="1631qlink2">was essentially lifted from it, with a few bolder ideas thrown</a> in.  Neither 
<a name="1455qlink2">novel impressed me that much; the aliens were simply too _human_.  Or at 
</a>
least their motivations were.</a>  (Norman Spinrad's "Songs from the Stars" is a 
much better treatment of the SETI theme, in my opinion.)

<p>
<a name="1455qlink3">Perhaps the best "first contact" novel I've read is Whitley</a> Strieber's 
"Majestic," a fictionalized account of the alleged Roswell crash.  You don't 
have to have an opinion one way or the other to enjoy this...I read it as a 
kind of spooky, well-realized alternate history.<a name="1455qlink4">  But the aliens in it--or, 
at least, their insinuated presence--is what makes this one work.  They're 
genuinely "other," not high-tech versions of ourselves, which is a common 
pitfall in mainstream SF.</a>
