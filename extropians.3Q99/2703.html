Hello everyone,

<p>
Regarding the following statement:

<p>
<a href="2643.html#2703qlink1">&gt;Most people would call me socialist for bringing this up but I think</a><br>
<i>&gt;it is both socialist and capitalist.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The idea is:</i><br>
<i>&gt;Free Medical &amp; Dental</i><br>
<i>&gt;Free Education</i><br>
<i>&gt;Free Housing</i><br>
<i>&gt;Anything else you want you can buy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The idea is by helping your neighbor you increase your own chance for</i><br>
<i>&gt;survival.  Anyone for this? Against It? Any ideas on how it would work?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2957qlink1"><a name="2823qlink1"><a name="2708qlink1">I think in a society with a mature nanotech it is ethically the right thing 
to make sure all of its citizens have an adequate level of free medical, 
education,  housing and food.<a name="2823qlink2">  I feel this is the humane thing to do yet I 
<a name="2957qlink2"><a name="2890qlink2">feel it should just be at a level to meet basic needs and not</a> to elevate the 
<a name="2890qlink3">lazy to a grand lifestyle.  So for those who want the "good things</a> of life" 
<a name="2890qlink4">such as a mansion, education at Stanford, gourmet meals,</a> and exotic cosmetic 
surgery will have to work</a> for it.
</a>
</a>

<p>
<a name="2957qlink3"><a name="2890qlink5"><a name="2823qlink3"><a name="2708qlink2">It is simply that the unambitious citizen of 2100 A.D. will have</a> a lifestyle 
</a>
</a>
<a name="2957qlink4"><a name="2890qlink7"><a name="2890qlink6"><a name="2823qlink4">better then that of a solid middle-class citizen of our own time.</a>  But he 
</a>
</a>
may want to set some goals and start achieving them when he sees how the 
</a>
folks are doing who applied themselves and are on a far better standard of 
</a>
<a name="2890qlink8">living as they can afford the latest bio-engineering fad for their bodies 
and vacation on the moon!  Let us be humane and stamp out disease, lack</a> of 
<a name="2890qlink9">proper education and poverty,  yet still award the talented and ambitious.</a>  
<a name="2890qlink10">We can do both and my vision will occur.  We will awaken into this world 
when we who are cryonically suspended are reanimated.</a>

</a>
</a>
<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
