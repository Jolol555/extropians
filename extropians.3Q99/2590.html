<p>
I honestly don't know for sure, but my intuition says that the clock
will tilt before you adjust the magnetic field (hints of the old
thalidomide reaction that Azimov used to speak of) though how close the
action/reaction will occur I cannot say. The fact that we are on this
side of the big bang (thus dictating the force of entropy in one
direction) probably decides the issue differently than in an anti-matter
universe on the other side of the big bang.</a>

<p>
<a name="2614qlink9">Someone said my perception of this was a misunderstanding, but they
failed to explain why the Transactional interpretation should not be
taken as literally as this. I would be very interested in hearing this
explaination.</a>
