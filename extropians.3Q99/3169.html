children *without* a balanced offsetting presentation?"

<p>
Did I say that?  What I meant was that parents should be free to teach
what they want OR to be allowed to send their children to schools that
teach what they want.  Competition of schools should provide this
offsetting presentation, shouldn't it?  I don't think I implied that
there should be no alternative.

<p>
<a href="3148.html#3169qlink2">"IF YOU PROMOTE LIBERTARIANISM *WITHOUT* RESPONSIBILITY, THEN YOU *ARE*</a><br>
BEING UN-EXTROPIAN."

<p>
I agree, and I didn't think I was.  Responsibility is an individual
thing.  It doesn't flow down from an all-knowing government - it's
something that people must accept for themselves or suffer the
consequences.

<p>
<a href="3148.html#3169qlink3">"So, that being said, I don't find Joao's perspective too</a><br>
disconcerting.  Certainly we need to develop societies in which
<br>
<a href="3148.html#3169qlink4">"informed consent" gives you the ability to assume the risks of</a><br>
entering such societies.  [Such as societies where everyone is free to
carry a handgun and shoot you if you "accidentally" insult them.  But
to let people (such as children) enter such societies having no
comprehension of the risks, contract obligations, handicaps, etc. seems
to me to be the height of irresponsibility."

<p>
What is the alternative?  Joao mentioned that children should be forced
to learn evolution.  This implies governmental coercion, doesn't it? 
Government coercion is possible because it is backed up with big men
with guns.  Wasn't this tried in the Soviet Union when atheism was the
state "religion?"  Is this responsibility?  I know you have thought
this through better than I have, Robert, so help me out here.  Are you
saying that there is some Extropian way or some way compatible with
Extropian beliefs to insure parental responsibility?  Is there some way
to force people to be responsible and still allow for
self-determination and an open society?

<p>
I guess I must be missing something, so please help me understand.
