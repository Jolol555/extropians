In a nanotech world, many people won't be buying from
corporations, they will be building at home.  [Presumably with
some "consensus" approval that what they are building is safe.
I.e. your nanoassemblers have security protocols and failsafes
so that only "nanoassmbly review committee" approved designs
can be replicated.  However, it should be a "fundamental right"
to nanoassemble at home (you do it internally every day anyway).
Since the designs will mainly be bottom up, the verification
as safe process should be possible.]

<p>
Corporations will only be selling to the rich people, who want
<a name="2899qlink2">a non-open source design for the prestige factor.</a>  [I.e. the
people who don't find reading a book as enjoyable as driving
a Mercedes.]  That market will likely be very small, because
as the "purchasing" needs of individuals are met, corporate
markets shrink [No GM's, Ford's, Nikes, Dupoints, etc. when
you can grow your own!]  There may be Disney's, but if
technology trends keep going as they have been, they may
have a tough road -- As "The Blair Witch Project" and the
knockoffs "The Oz Witch Project", "The Princess Witch Project",
shows, anyone can make a an entertaining film now-a-days, you don't
need a $100 million dollar budget.  When you can do the entire
thing on the computer the competition for eyes-seeking-entertainment
gets pretty fierce.  [Anyone for open-sourcing the Industrial
Light &amp; Magic code?]

<p>
Since you don't have to work you can stay at home and give your
children 1 on 1 attention.  Though by that time computers with
near-human capacity should have fairly amazing learning programs.
Montesorri style exploration on the computer (or you go out into
the real world with a wearable uplink).  If you don't like the
design of a piece of software, you right your own better version
and release it to the world.

<p>
When you can spend $1000 (for those $.001 royalties/copy) and get
a complete educational environment for your children, the educational
system as we know it implodes!  If even a small fraction of the
6 Billion people with nothing to do devote their time to constructing
the complete educational environment and open sourcing it, then 
you probably don't even have to spend the $1000.
