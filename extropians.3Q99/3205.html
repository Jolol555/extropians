<a href="3197.html#3205qlink1">&gt; I think some of the older members remember me and all the</a><br>
<i>&gt; insults I got for my opposition to libertarianism.</i><br>

<p>
Yes, some of us do remember; and I remember that at least some
part of the lively and vigorous debate was quite enlightening and
useful to clarify positions on both sides.  I also remember some
childish insults and dishonest rhetoric on both sides.  That's an
unfortunate side effect of discussions on ethics or other tough
subjects, but on the whole I think the discussion was valuable.

<p>
<a href="3196.html#3205qlink2">&gt; It's a very big contradiction for someone who claims to be able to</a><br>
<i>&gt; adapt to new ideas and situations not to listen to other people's</i><br>
<i>&gt; point of view.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3286qlink1">And it's a pretty cheap shot to accuse the opposition of not having 
listened to or understood you when it is quite clear--both then and
now--that we understand your point of view completely, and reject</a> it.
<a name="3286qlink2">I'm glad you and others bring up opposing points of view here,
especially when they really are new ideas instead of old and tired
ones.  I hope you don't let the fact that we'll go for the throat
every time dissuade you--that's what critical thinking is about:
not making nice-nice and accepting everybody's ideas, but criticizing
them all with every ounce of intellectual rigor to see who's left
standing when the smoke clears.</a>
