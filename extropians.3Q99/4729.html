<p>
Apologies if this was misattributed.  I was mainly intending to comment 
on Markman's column that you referenced (@moneycentral.msn.com) as well
as comments on the Nanovation pages.

<p>
[As a more general comment, I'll simply state that interpreting letters
in hypertext as non-hypertext is probably an error prone process so
until we all have a common set of tools that interprets both or
we have a better interface in general, mistakes may get made.
So I guess both care and tolerance are suggested.]

<p>
<a href="4722.html#4729qlink2">&gt; The issue of digial gridlock is interesting from the point of view of an</a><br>
<i>&gt; investor looking for opportunities.</i><br>

<p>
True, and in that respect, high frequency (GHz) radio for the last
mile seems quite interesting.

<p>
<i>&gt; I agree with your two points about, if we're talking about *net* gridlock</i><br>
<a href="4722.html#4729qlink3">&gt; (which is probably what the above quote means), but that's not the</a><br>
<i>&gt; *only* kind of gridlock. I have not personally examined what Nanovation</i><br>
<i>&gt; is up to, so I don't know whether or not it's really addressing gridlock</i><br>
<i>&gt; internal to computer systems.</i><br>

<p>
Nanovation is directly trying to address telecommunications bottlenecks
and perhaps to a lesser degree computer bottlenecks.  I get bent
when news (based on corporate press) excessively promote a solution to
a problem which (to me) seems nonexistent [i.e. net gridlock].

<p>
<a href="4722.html#4729qlink4">&gt; Yes, there are such areas of gridlock or bottlenecks. (Which I'm glad</a><br>
<i>&gt; to hear that Intel is boosting bus rates and not just microprocessors</i><br>
<i>&gt; while I put off buying a new computer...) &gt; </i><br>

<p>
Putting off buying a new computer seems to make a huge amount of sense
now-a-days.  However, no matter how much they boost bus speeds, the
processor clock speeds will be boosted faster.  The Memory(bus)-to-Processor
speed gap *IS* the fundamental problem in computer architectures at
this point and bus speed increases or cache size increases are only
stop-gap measures before the fundamental architectural problem needs
to be addressed.  You *either* must go to optical buses (less likely)
or shift the archtecture to processor-in-memory (probably more likely).

<p>
<a href="4722.html#4729qlink5">&gt; Right. That's one reason I own a little piece of JDS Uniphase -- one of the</a><br>
<i>&gt; best perfomers in my portolio (or in anyone's portfolio) this year. ETEK</i><br>
<i>&gt; and other companies are also (more narrowly) working on boosting optical</i><br>
<i>&gt; capacity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
I'm unfamiliar with the company(s), but if that is their strategy, it
seems very sound to me.
