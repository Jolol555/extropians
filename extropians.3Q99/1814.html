I don't want this to turn into a metaphysics post, but isn't the so-called
<br>
"re-wiring" of conditioning you speak of just another form of conditioning?<br>
What is conditioning except the creation of neural structures from
interaction with our environment?

<p>
Of course you've been successful in reprogramming conditioned responses -
but where did the motivation and skills to do so come from? From previous
conditioning. It *is* completely regressive. Therefore I don't see that your
response provides any argument for the existence of free will.

<p>
I have two experiments to determine whether or not an individual can
demonstrate free will. I should start by defining 'free will' as "The power,
attributed especially to human beings, of making free choices that are
unconstrained by external circumstances or by an agency such as fate or
divine will".


<OL>
  <li>  deliberately stop thinking for an hour. Can you stop thoughts from being
generated at will?
  <li>  explain how you go about creating a thought. Do you control the process
or do they appear spontaneously?

Genetics has no bearing on our decisions if we've already
uploaded our brains into computronium structures and
completely re-written or erased any residual memetic
processes that originated through blind genetic evolution.

<p>
What is conditioning if we are re-wiring that as well?  I
have been quite sucessful in reprogramming a whole series of
conditioned responses.  So who is doing the re-conditioning?
We find ourselves in an infinite regress, so there is no
remaining merit in your answer.
