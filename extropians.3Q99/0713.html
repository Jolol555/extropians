<a name="0727qlink1"><a href="0704.html#0713qlink1">&gt;&gt; Members of SPSR (Scientists for the Study of Planetary SETI Research) are </a><br>

<i>&gt;Wouldn't that be SSPSR? Either the scientists or the study is apparently</i><br>
<i>&gt;missing. Maybe both. Note that they don't actually study, they only advocate</i><br>
<a name="0725qlink1"><i>&gt;studying. 'Scientists *for the* Study.'  And you're not allowed to have an</i><br>
<i>&gt;acronym in an acronym. You're supposed to expand it. That would make it</i><br>
<i>&gt;SSPSETIR, which looks very odd.</a></i><br>

<p>
The correct designation is Society for Planetary SETI Research; I wrote the 
above in haste and obviously didn't get it right.  I'm interested, though, in 
where the "crackpot" bit comes in.  I posted about some known anomalies that, 
hopefully, will be reimaged shortly by a NASA spacecraft.  Nothing crazy 
about that.  Even Carl Sagan urged additional study into this.

<p>
Who's the crackpot here?  And how does a mis-typing help you spot one...?
