*Biotech Breakthrough? 'Buckyball shards' show promise for chemical<br>
separations, Science paper suggests. A new carbon material, resembling bits
of buckminsterfullerene or 'buckyball' molecules, suggests a cheaper,
lower-energy method for generating enriched oxygen and nitrogen, crucial
ingredients for the production of steel and chemicals, and for the
preservation of foods and medicines, DuPont and UD scientists report Sept.
17 in Science.

*Tracks in iron provide an insightful map of microbial world<br>
Reading the narrow bands of iron found in some sedimentary rocks, scientists
may have found a way to assess microbial populations across time and space,
opening a window to the early history of life on Earth and possibly other
planets.

*Bubonic plague kills by cutting off cellular communication. Yersinia<br>
pestis, the deadly bacterium that causes bubonic plague, kills by cutting
off a cell's ability to communicate with other immune system cells needed to
fight off the bacterial invasion. In a study published in the Sept. 17 issue
of Science, University of Michigan scientists identify one protein
responsible for the plague's lethal effect and the molecular family it
targets.

*Boston University researchers have discovered a way to shape the noise<br>
spectrum of analog signals for higher fidelity, achieving ear-rivaling
dynamic range (DR) and virtually unbounded signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) by
using a variable-sized neural network. They claim that their neural
network's DR is proportional to the number of its neurons, and SNR goes up
exponentially with each added neuron. Thus, those two important
sound-quality factors can be indefinitely increased, simply by adding
neurons.

*(IEEE abstract) This paper discusses the creation and use of unique<br>
identifiers for intellectual property. General concepts applicable to unique
identifiers are defined and discussed [identifier, digital object, dumb and
intelligent identifiers, readability, affordance or computability, multiple
identification, resolution, metadata, persistence, granularity, derivatives
(e.g., versions, formats, manifestations, and copies), check digits, and
intermediate objects]. Requirements for unique identifiers are reviewed.

*California governor Gray Davis on Thursday digitally signed into law  a<br>
bill that gives electronic signatures equal legal standing with traditional
signatures produced with a pen. The Uniform Electronic Transactions Act,
which goes into effect on Jan. 1, makes electronic signatures legally
binding in many types of legal documentation - including state or local
laws, rental agreements, and leases. A number of documents will still
require a signature, such as wills and real-estate transactions. The

California adopted the Uniform Electronic Transactions Act, which it is
hoped will reasonably soon be adopted by all or almost all of the states and
therefore create a level of uniformity desirable for online commerce.  For

*New law requires British restaurants to identify genetically modified food.<br>
LONDON (September 17, 1999 7:49 p.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) -
British restaurants and caterers will have to tell customers which of their
dishes contain genetically modified ingredients under a new law that goes
into effect Sunday. The use of genetically modified, or GM, ingredients in
foods is being hotly debated in Britain. Polls indicate many people strongly
disapprove, while many want at least further research to be conducted. GM
foods are made from plants whose genes are manipulated in order to produce
characteristics such as resistance to pests. Britain has yet to approve
raising GM crops, but some imported ingredients do contain GM plants. Food
Minister Baroness Hayman said on Friday that the new labeling requirements,
like those that have applied to food sold at retail since September 1998,
"will ensure that consumers are entitled to the same information when eating
out as they expect when buying their own food in shops." Failure to comply
with the new law can be punished by fines of up to $8,000. "The government
is committed to ensuring that consumers are able to make an informed choice
about the food they eat," she said.

*POOLED GENES | Britain should soon have a centralised database containing<br>
samples of DNA donated by its citizens. The database, being planned by the
Medical Research Council and the Wellcome Trust, will help researchers
discover important disease-causing genes. The scheme will be different from
the one that has caused controversy in Iceland. There, DNA and medical
records of the entire population have been included in a database held by a
single company, DeCode Genetics of Reykjavik. In Britain, samples will only
be included if their donors consent, and the database will be open to all
researchers.

*Same-sex emu 'couple' leaves experts stumped.<br>
Two Australian male emus have set up a nest together, confounding experts
who said Friday they did not know if the birds were homosexual, confused or
simply practical. The two adult males have shacked up to care for a clutch
of seven chicks in the Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, south of Canberra. While
wildlife officers are not yet convinced the males are homosexual, they can
offer no explanation for the surprising move. "It's unusual for a male to
adopt chicks that aren't their own, but the two males have paired up and are
getting along very well," said wildlife officer and acting manager of
Tidbinbilla Nature Reserve, Geoff Underwood. "One male is very
accommodating - normally he would chase any other emu away from the chicks."
Male emus normally take over rearing their young after female partners lay
the eggs, protecting their babies from the outside world and especially
other males. But Underwood said the pairing of two males was the first of
its kind in the 25 years he had worked in the area. "It's a bit of a
mystery," he said. "It is normally a sole male role, but it appears they are
moving away from single-parent families. It is an ultra-modern family, but I
don't think they are homosexual. The other male is just confused."
