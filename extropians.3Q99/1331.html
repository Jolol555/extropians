The following is from Stanley McDaniel's site.  I thought it may be of some

FACE IMAGING OPPORTUNITIES IN AUGUST AND NOVEMBER 1999

<p>
Recent calculations give dates and times

<p>
July 28, 1999

<p>
Based on current orbital elements recently released by JPL, an SPSR 
correspondent has discovered that overhead flybys of the Face at Cydonia 
will occur once in August and again in November 1999. The data indicates 
that the ground track repeat cycle is 59.04 km (exactly 1 degree of 
longitude at the equator), and the orbital period is 1.949389 hours. 
Calculated from this data, the next two Cydonia fly-overs should occur 
on Orbit 742 and Orbit 1811 after the June 27, 1999 City Pyramid Orbit. 
The first takes place on August 26, 1999 at 17:07 GMT. The second will 
occur on November 21, 1999 at 13:14 GMT. The single image of the Face 
taken in April 1998, because of spacecraft angle and poor weather 
conditions, is not adequate for a satisfactory result as far as the qu
estion of possible artificiality is concerned. The flyovers in August 
and November should deliver better data, as the sun angle and the camera 
position will be optimal. Therefore images of the Face during these two 
opportunities would be of great scientific value. We urge interested 
parties to write to NASA, JPL, and Malin Space Science Systems, 
requesting images be taken of the Face on each of these two dates.
