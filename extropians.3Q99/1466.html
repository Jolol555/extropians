<a name="1492qlink1">On several occasions, one or two of the koi in my rooftop pond have escaped
capture and relocation to the indoor tank when the weather turned cold.
During a January thaw a couple years ago, I took the opportunity of the
first &gt;40 degree weather in a couple months to clean up the deck a bit.
After I took out the 2-3 inch thick slab of ice left in the bottom of a
mostly emptied 45 gallon container a small fish gave a little spasm in the
melting goop. "Lucky" is still alive and kicking. Checking out books on koi
(aka carp, aka japanese goldfish), it seems as though surviving complete
freezing/thawing is a recognized and common ability of these animals, even
large specimens weighing several pounds.</a>
