I have to side with Kathryn here.  If we want our
organization to grow, proper use of the media will be
important to our success.  The media is nothing if not a
slave to the zeitgeist, and they know they can always
attract interest in a story by citing politically incorrect
practices as evidence of bad intentions.

<p>
<a name="2944qlink1">You can bet that if we ever become important enough to get

sound bytes on the six o' clock news the press will never
fail to include a reference to our shockingly dated
demographics in their description of transhumanists.  I can
hear it already :  "The spokesperson for the Extropy
Institue,
<br>
a group that is comprised 99% of white males, made the
following statement...."

<p>
I'm not saying I'm a huge fan of political correctness.  I'm
not crazy about oil slicks on the highway either, but I
still make sure to steer my car clear of them.  If nothing
else, it would be a politically smart move for us to try and
recruit a more diverse constituency.

<p>
Yes, it would be better that way, if we lived in a
thoroughly evolved, thoroughly transhuman world already.
But we don't.  Most of the world's population is still very
hung up on racial and gender distinctions, and I think we
can be a little sympathetic to that considering that most of
the world's races and genders haven't always been treated so
well.  When people see a group of white males getting
together to discuss "our" future, it's understandable if
some of them get a little nervous.

<p>
So wait, you're Swedish, Italian, Norwegian, and African?
Just the diversity we need around here :)
