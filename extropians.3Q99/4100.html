How about a Martian?....some aluminum foil to cover his clothes...some
green eye makeup covering his face and hands and covering his head.....oh
yes...some foil antennae ..that should do it.&nbsp; Now that's a cheap
costume.&nbsp; Ok..I don't exactly know if that is what a Martian looks
like...but it's a good a guess as any!.&nbsp; Have fun!

<BLOCKQUOTE TYPE=CITE>Howdy all,

<P>I have a 2 and a half year old son and I'm trying to think of something

<BR>but not quite, inappropriate for a small child.&nbsp; :)&nbsp; Heh
heh.&nbsp; I want
<BR>people to think, "What the hell??", but not "You bastard!"

<P>The costume must be relatively cheap and easy to build and put on.

<P>Any ideas?

<P>:)

<P>Thanks!
