No need to apologize and I don't really disagree with you as a matter of 
principle. It's just that my personal prejudices on this subject are fairly 
well known, as I've been discussing them here lately.  When I was younger, I 
followed the space program the way most kids followed sports and the 
astronauts were to me what the Dallas Cowboys were to my playmates.  You'd 
get the same touchy reaction from most men my age who grew up in Texas if you 
dissed Don Meredith.  On a rational level, I'm fully aware of how 
"artificial" the whole process was, but when Neal Armstrong put his bootprint 
in the dust of Mare Tranquilitas he won what for me was the ultimate 
Superbowl.

<p>
There is a deeper issue here, though, which we've discussed in the "Big 
Science/Big Government" thread some time back.  Government subsidies ARE like 
a drug, but the question is whether going cold turkey at a particular time 
can do more harm than good.  The fact is that the current NASA administration 
HAS engaged in a serious program of "reform", and Dan Goldin has made 
"smaller, faster, cheaper" into an effective motto that has yielded positive 
science and technology goals.  I want to see space science weaned from the 
corrupting influence of government support as quickly as possible, but I 
WOULD like to avoid destroying the life work of a whole generation of space 
scientists in the process.
