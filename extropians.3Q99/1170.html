Yes yes yes yes yes.

<p>
Actually for several Saturdays now, I've been conducting my own random
telephone survey on public attitudes toward life extension. Surprisingly,
there aren't too many people with strong opinions on it. Most draw a
complete blank, and none have ridiculed the idea. Of course, I use the
phrase 'longevity research', not 'life extension' and definitely not
'immortality'. &lt;OFF-TOPIC&gt;If there is any interest, I can follow up with
the FTP location of my survey-kit-- everything you need to reproduce my
survey in your own area&lt;/OFF-TOPIC&gt;
 
<p>
<a href="1163.html#1170qlink3">&gt; Is it reasonable to assume that the PR concerns are about this - being seen</a><br>
<i>&gt; as a bunch of crazy fringe looneys? If so why not be a focus group?</i><br>

<p>
Most people at least recognize that I might have a valid point when I tell
them about &gt;H and ExI. The reaction is more like, "whatever, that's over
my head". Then again, since I'm super paranoid about politics and PR to
begin with, my experience might not be typical.

Right on, sister! I personally know at least one group represented here
who may be interested in your contribution, but I'll let them speak for
themselves, as I don't know whether they formally consider me a member at
this time...
