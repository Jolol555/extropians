<a name="0958qlink1">We don't know for a fact if there are or are not non-human artifacts on
Mars or not, but anyone with two eyes and at least a 120 IQ can plainly
see that the landscape at Cydonia is NOT a non-human intelligently
constructed artifact. Since most people who are not blind can see this,
we should stop wasting our breath and money dealing with a few people
who refuse to beleive their own eyes.</a>
