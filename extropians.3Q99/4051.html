If you really want to try being a girl, the easiest and safest way is to try
<a name="4058qlink1">being a transvestite.  I went to a "come as a girl, whether you are one or
not" party a few years ago and was surprised to see one of my hairiest, most
aggressive male friends daintily sipping tea and dishing out the most catty
gossip.</a></a>

Spike, if you're interested in gender issues, I strongly suggest you spend
more time in San Francisco and particularly the Castro.  I would try calling
the San Francisco Sex Information Hotline and ask them if there are any
resources for straight men who would like to become more educated about
gender bending issues.  Also, you might want to think about auditing a human
sexuality class at SFSU night school; I recommend Dr. John Elia.  His class
is never dull.
