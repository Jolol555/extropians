<a href="0074.html#0091qlink1">&gt; &gt; I mean, when I think about your suggestion, I can imagine what</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; and sterile existence"!  But I would argue, and maybe you would</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; too, that the "sub-problems" are really what life is all about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; And I always think it's rather Anthro-centric to think that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; appreciating art and beauty and so forth are peculiar human</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; abilities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0095qlink2"><i>&gt; Actually, I'm still not quite sure where beauty and music and laughter</i><br>
<i>&gt; come from.  I think it has something to do with sexual selection, but I</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't know enough to duplicate it.  They don't get any more peculiar</i><br>
<i>&gt; than</a> that.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I personally think that they are just ways of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; thinking about patterns and analogies, an ability which an AI</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; will certainly have.  I.e., "sub-problems"!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But then why do they cause joy?  And is the joy of seeing a beautiful</i><br>
<i>&gt; MotOS the same kind of joy as seeing an elegant theorem?  </i><br>

<p>
Well, yes, I think so.  But then, maybe I've been staring at my 
computer too much.  I've thought about this issue for a long time,
and over the years I've come to believe that there are strong 
connections between these various types of emotions.  I can only
speak for myself, though, of course.  For example, I think that the
"aha!" moment I get when finally understanding a difficult 
mathematical concept, or in figuring out a technical problem, is
*very* similar to the sudden burst of laughter that erupts when I
the punch line of a really good joke kicks in.  Irony is so 
delicious because it's about seeing patterns and analogies where
you wouldn't ordinarily expect them. 


<p>
<a href="0074.html#0091qlink2">&gt; If not, which</a><br>
<i>&gt; category does the joy of music belong to, and does it matter whether the</i><br>
<i>&gt; music is "Holding Out for a Hero" or "Little Fugue in G Minor"?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
