<a name="3291qlink1">Thoughts are both conscious and unconscious processes.  Because</a> the brain is 
always matching memory patterns, and since memory is distributed throughout 
the brain, and one part of it being echoic memory (where thoughts are 
comprehended as language) then obviously you can't have complete control 
there. Thoughts will just pop in your head as parts of memory are read and 
distributed.

<p>
A thought is also stored in memory since self awareness is the recognition 
of the pattern that you are making all the decisions.  Of course the brain 
can read that part of memory and its associations, and be so complex that 
there isn't just one course of action, or there are to many associations to 
be distributed and processed at the same time.  It's like trying to pass 64 
bits each via a 4 bit bus between 7 circuits at the same time.  Since 
different functions of the brain are constantly processing, new information 
is constantly needing to be passed to other functions.  A particular brain's 
function can't possibly hold all its data along with the new information 
that it's constantly collecting so it needs a way to decide what information 
is passed and what information is forgotten.  It would likely do this 
through some sort of logic gate.

<p>
In my opinion, logic gates are the most complicated parts of the brain.  
Logic gates are made up of memory counters and programmed responses.  Also, 
emotion most likely plays a roll in its make up. Each function of the brain 
has logic gates that pass information to other parts of the brain.  Also, 
brain functions that work together have logic gates connecting other brain 
functions that work together. That again could produce an even higher 
hierarchy of brain functions controlled via another series of logic gates.  
This continues until all functions and emergent functions (two or more 
functions combined to create another function) of the brain are connected.

<p>
How logic gates work.
<br>
Every time a part of memory is referenced it is noted (hence counted). Study 
shows that when someone uses a part of memory new connections are made to 
it.  That does two things. 1)Makes it more likely to be referenced again. 
2)Contributes to the decision of what information is passed.  Many parts of 
the mind (and body) act reflexively.  My post "consciousness, self, 
awareness...." helps explain why.  These connections are what physically 
associates memories to other memories. The collection of memories with the 
most connections are compared with learned logic (programmed responses).  
Learned logic is logic that is taught or programmed in the genes (born 
reflexes).  As you grew up your mother taught you things -that's not nice, 
share, keep clean, love your neighbor, sex is bad, worship God, etc...

<p>
And then finally there is the emotional part.  I'm still not sure how 
emotion fits in but I know that it does, because people do make decisions 
based on their emotions.  Perhaps the chemicals cause shorts in the 
comparisons.  Or maybe it speeds up the decision making process so you don't 
have the usual amount of comparison time.  Or maybe it adds associations 
related to the emotion to the decision making process.  Or maybe its a 
combination of these things.  Emotion is not logical and I just don't know 
enough about it to make it fit in my model.  I do know, however, that it is 
part of the decision making process.

<p>
<a href="2393.html#3035qlink4">&gt;Are you claiming this to be a conscious process?</a><br>

<p>
Because thoughts are distributed throughout the brain between functions 
traveling via memory, and since part of that memory is echoic memory (where 
you comprehend as language), and because consciousness is the memories 
traveling between functions, and because awareness is the recognition of 
your thoughts you will be both aware and conscious of thoughts being formed. 
  See post "consciousness, self, awareness".

<p>
How did you control the thoughts?
<br>
I'm having a great time writing my ideas down.  Something I've never done 
before.  I'm going to find a snack machine and refuel.  I'll be in the 
library till eight so I hope I can finish this tonight.
