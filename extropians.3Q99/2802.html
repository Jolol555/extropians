I believe Kathryn, if you go back and look at the thread, you
may find that I posed the question in the interest of determining
*why* most of us are "free thinkers", which could contribute to
the extensive discussion regarding good educational stratagies
[Make them all outcasts if you want to free the world...!?!]

<p>
"Antisocial geek status" doesn't bring my mind to Columbine
[I suspect it only does if you have had your nose glued to TV
or Newspaper processing the pablum for the masses -- jab,
jab :-)]

As far as I myself go (you note that I carefully asked the question
before declaring my loyalties...), I was a lower grade misfit because
of where my family lived and my interests (science over sports).
I turned that around in junior high and high school and managed
to get accepted by both the sports crowd and the academics.
I didn't get elected to class treasurer, but did get voted most
likely to succeed.  And certainly went back to my 20th class reunion
as just that.

<p>
I've been there, done that and am now onto better things.
It doesn't stop me from wondering from time to time whether
adversity is good for developing in children a strong will
to never give up in the face of adversity.

<p>
With the geeks rolling in money, its hard for it to be un-hip.
We would have to go back to the 60's love-generation to get that
mindset.

Watch it buddy, if you aren't careful, I'll "fix" it so the
Extro5 conference "party" has a band that only plays *disco* music.
