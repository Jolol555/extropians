<p>
<a href="4528.html#4588qlink1">&gt; I found it interesting when I read _The Journey to the West_ that the</a><br>
<i>&gt; Monkey King was referred to as a Zen master (beside already being a</i><br>
<i>&gt; Taoist master, king and just about everything else; if he had been a</i><br>
<i>&gt; character in a roleplaying game I would have said that his player was</i><br>
<i>&gt; a power-gamer :-). He is almost the epitome of ambition and often acts</i><br>
<i>&gt; impulsively, hardly the conventional image of the Zen master. But at</i><br>
<i>&gt; the same time he is always breaking out of old limitations like being</i><br>
<i>&gt; just a monkey, mortality, inability to change form and not being part</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the pantheon - instead he does everything he can to become</i><br>
<i>&gt; enlightened, immortal, divine and powerful, never stopping for long in</i><br>
<i>&gt; his ambitions. The only time he really stopped before a limit was when</i><br>
<i>&gt; he made the bet with Buddha about jumping to the end of the world -</i><br>
<i>&gt; and that was his undoing.</i><br>
He urinates on Buddha's fingers (the pillars at the end of the world?), as
far as I remember. That's style!

<p>
<i>&gt;  Had he really gone *beyond* the apparent</i><br>
<a href="4528.html#4588qlink2">&gt; limit he would have suceeded. </a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; As I have said before, I really like that character and consider him a</i><br>
<i>&gt; kind of transhumanist saint.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
This is the book that the television show "Monkey Magic" is based on, is it
not? A transhumanist saint? Absolutely!

<p>
(I always wanted to be Monkey when I was a kid, so perhaps the transhumanist
in me is not newly arrived after all...)
