Don't think so, boss. It has been predicted before, several times 
in fact. It regularly doesn't happen. Why don't we still use 
PETs, apple ]['s or CP/M boxen? Ah, but you can't do multimedia 
with 6502/Z80s. Similiarly, you can't do realtime neural DSP with 
the Merced, no Sir.

Yes, watch out for the Playstation 2. The first embedded RAM 
processor (and a whopping 4 MBytes grain as well) for the

In fact not only pitiful, but really *insane*. But for whatever
strange reason, people still think Silicon Valley is populated by
rational Spock-like types instead of mad hatter tinkerers. Low-fat 
computing isn't exactly popular -- all hail to investment protection.

<p>
A wafer-integrated CAM implemented with that process, ah, that would
be wonderful. Let your compiler crank out VHDL which get translated in 
virtual circuitry. I doubt the emulation would be much slower than the 
real thing, and you could always reconfigger the thing dynamicaly
whenever the needs change.

Some of the heat comes from driving I/O to the outside world. Dump
motherboards, dump packaging &amp; things suddenly start running faster &amp;

<p>
The reversible stuff is especially suitable for CAMs. It is extremely
tedious building a practical reversible CPU, and we're many orders of
magnitude away where the effects will start to show. At molecular
scale, on the other hand...

May caches burn in hell along with their designers. They're unphysical.

But CAM don't require high inter-CPU bandwidth, that's the chiefest
beauty of them. Volume/surface scaling ratio. With current grain sizes 
you can comfortably run a CAM code on a pile of PCs with wimpy
networking matrix.

Aw, come on. That's ridiculous. Then why not a bandersnatch, delivered 
by 2010 sharp.

Let's go code gardeners. Grow your own app.
