<a name="3837qlink3"><a name="3836qlink6">These are very hard problems to think about - the flow of the system 
is extremely complex and dynamic. To predict the behavior of the 
system at some point in time, you need to know the complete state 
of the system, which requires knowing how the system behaved in 
the previous time-step, etc. The feedback process leads to very 
simple programs with extremely complicated behavior.</a>

<i>&gt; Mutation of what?  Your assembly instructions?  These have ECC</i><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes.  It is interesting that we can build very complex machines that</i><br>
<i>&gt; function quite well but cannot build complex sequences of </i><br>
instructions
<br>
<a href="3793.html#3831qlink6">&gt; that function equivalently well.  Is this a problem with simply</a><br>
<i>&gt; testing and software failure modes or is it something else?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3836qlink11">I think there is something different about software. It's dynamic 
nature makes is much more difficult (if not possible) to analyze than 
more traditional engineering tasks, and the range of things you can 
do in software is much larger and much less well understood.</a> There 
are also cultural problems - poor quality programming 
tools/languages, drifting requirements, and more demand for 
software than there are people who know how to produce it. (I've got 
a whole rant on the state of the industry, so be careful about getting 
me started...)
