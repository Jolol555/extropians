hotglue them onto a stack of perforated plexiglas sheet and wirewrap
them gluelessly into a 16x16x16 DSP array (adding little LED blinkenlights 
to each link port for cuteness value), putting the edge node as a PCI
card into a garden-variety Linux box. So this gives me 2 GBytes of
on-die memory a la 4 MBit each, in toto a ~10 kW heat dissipation
(heck put it into an aquarium filled with Fluorinert and mount an
aircooled heat exchanger on top of that), 2.4 TFlops peak box in 
a half-height 19" rack (for how much? 100..500 k$? ballpark of a
high-end workstation) -- enough horsepower to upload a nematode, or 
even a fruit fly. It's comparatively easy (well, possible) to write 
a nanokernel OS taking 4..16 kByte memory footprint or so, so this 
leaves me with essentially half a MByte/node to work with -- 
however, how do you expect to port Excel to such an architecture? 
How much of Microsoft (or OpenSource stuff, for that matter) 
warez are written as asynchronous message-passing object soup?

The only reason machines as such are not widespread is that
./configure ; make ; make install is not sufficient to port 
your apps to them. Would make great game machines, though. Modelling,
volume viz/rendering, lots of potential.
