Rockets are terribly inneficient at producing thrust.  Of hand, I can't

<p>
<a name="2561qlink4">Aircar designs don't use rockets.  They use jet engines, ducted fans, and
all sorts of other gadgets, all of which are far more fuel efficient than
rocket engines.  They also</a> benifit from better streamlining, and the
constraints on the size and shape of the engines are not nearly as severe.

<p>
Even ignoing all of that, the jet pack needs to carry several times its own
mass in payload, while the aircar does not.  That jet pack is 200 lb of
payload, 30 lb of engines and 70 lb of fuel.  The aircare can be 600 lb of
payload, 600 lb of vehicle and 1800 lb of fuel.  Thus, the aircar is a far
less demanding problem even if you want to be silly and insist on using
rockets.

<p>
<a name="2561qlink5"><i>&gt; I believe the estimates for fuel efficiency on the</i><br>
<a href="2490.html#2553qlink3">&gt; aircar are something like 12-14 mpg, so it isn't much worse than</a><br>
<i>&gt; an old gas guzzler automobile.</i><br>

<p>
That sounds like a number based on ducted fans, or maybe an efficient jet
engine.  Rockets would consume fuel a lot faster (maybe one of our rocket
plumbers has some numbers handy?)</a>

<p>
<a name="2561qlink6"><a href="2490.html#2553qlink4">&gt; I believe the statement has been made that rocket-to-orbit</a><br>
<i>&gt; requires ~ the fuel of a transcontinential trip.</i><br>

<p>
No, it takes a lot more than that.  An airliner can cross a continent
burning fuel equal to maybe 10-15% of its mass.  A rocket burns fuel equal
to ~90% of its mass to reach orbit.</a>

<p>
<a name="2561qlink7"><a href="2490.html#2553qlink5">&gt; Conclusion (1): JetPaks seem doable if you want to go to orbit.</a><br>
<i>&gt; Cross-country or other flights may be iffy without wings.</i><br>

<p>
No way.  Not without a fusion-powered thruster - and the pilot won't survive
the trip in any event.</a>

<p>
<a name="2561qlink8">In essense, the reason why jet packs are a useless curiosity is that rockets
are terribly fuel-hungry beasts, and a jet pack has no room for huge fuel
tanks.  Air cars are doable in theory becasue you can use less fuel-hungry
engines, and because you have a lot more design freedom.</a>
