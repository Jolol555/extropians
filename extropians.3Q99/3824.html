<a href="3809.html#3824qlink1">&gt;You're seriously suggesting dropping a 20MT bomb on Baghdad?</a><br>
<i>&gt;Really? I'm not misinterpreting you here? Are you insane?</i><br>

<p>
You're not only misinterpreting, you're doing so deliberately. 

<p>
In the event of a military conflict where B/C weapons are involved
I would advocate a nuclear response, since Baghdad is the military
center, it would be a prime target. I would probably provide 48
hours notice, (evacuate) then it would be crater city.

<p>
<a href="3809.html#3824qlink2">&gt;&gt;Nice of you to put such little value on U.S. soldiers.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="3809.html#3824qlink3">&gt;When they're acting as hired mercenaries, sent out to put Western</a><br>
<i>&gt;puppet leaders back in place in the name of 'freedom' and</i><br>
<i>&gt;'democracy', why should anyone value them higher than the hundreds</i><br>
<i>&gt;of thousands or millions of Iraqi civilians who you would happily</i><br>
<i>&gt;kill with your hydrogen bomb?</i><br>

<p>
Clearly you do not understand what a mercenary is, or more likely
yet another deliberate misinterpretation.
 
<p>
I value one U.S. soldier more than Baghdad. I would not "happily"
kill anyone.

<p>
<a href="3802.html#3824qlink4">&gt;&gt;yes I believe in the law of talion, use a weapon of mass</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;destruction, get one used on you.....</i><br>

<p>
<a href="3809.html#3824qlink5">&gt;So when Arabs decided to use nukes or bio/chemical weapons on DC</a><br>
<i>&gt;and a few other US cities in retaliation for the US nuclear strike</i><br>
<i>&gt;on Baghdad you'll just nod your head and say 'Well, that just</i><br>
<i>&gt;serves us right for using nuclear weapons'?</i><br>

<p>
Strawman again, the nuclear response would be just that, a
response. If anyone would launch a new attack after that, they too
would receive an overwhelming response......

<p>
<a href="3809.html#3824qlink6">&gt;I mean, seriously, forget for a moment that you're American.</a><br>
<i>&gt;Imagine yourself as a foreigner reading this discussion, realising</i><br>
<i>&gt;that ordinary Americans believe that they should be able to attack</i><br>
<i>&gt;any other country which annoys them, for any reason, and if that</i><br>
<i>&gt;other country decides to defend itself with the only effective</i><br>
<i>&gt;weapons it has, those Americans believe that they are perfectly</i><br>
<i>&gt;justified in vaporizing foreign cities containing millions of</i><br>
<i>&gt;civilians in retaliation.</i><br>

<p>
I have no intension of forgetting for an instant that I'm an
American, and yet again your at it with another Strawman. No one I
know of says we can go around attacking people who annoy us, and as
I've made clear only an attack with B/C weapons would earn a
nuclear response.

<p>
We did not start the war with Iraq, Iraq did by attacking Kuwait,
the continued hostilities are because of Iraq's noncompliance with
the terms of surrender.

<p>
<a href="3809.html#3824qlink7">&gt;Try that for a second. Try to imagine how this kind of American</a><br>
<i>&gt;militaristic arrogance looks to non-Americans (and if that fails,</i><br>
<i>&gt;go rent 'Starship Troopers'; the best satire on American</i><br>
<i>&gt;militarism I've ever seen). You may suddenly realise just why so</i><br>
<i>&gt;many non-Americans fear and hate you.</i><br>

<p>
Satire????? I must have missed that, as I recall we we're attacked
in that movie, and not just America, as I recall Buenos Aires
(beautiful city!) was attacked without provocation. Besides I own
Starship troopers (the book was better).

<p>
I was going to suggest moving this to private mail for the benefit
of the list, but I see by another message that your leaving
anyway...
