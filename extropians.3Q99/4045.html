There exists an FAQ on hormone therapy for female to male transsexuals at:
<a href="http://www.savina.com/confluence/hormone/m2f/">http://www.savina.com/confluence/hormone/m2f/</a>

<p>
It contains information on how feminizing hormones work, pre-op and post-op
doseage levels, and rankings of drugs based on safety and efficacy.

<p>
The medical standards of care that allow access to hormones are quite
strict, and with good reason.  You can make yourself very sick if you start
fooling around with hormones without at least having testing done to know
what your own levels of hormones are to begin with.  (Assuming you could
find a doctor to prescribe them in the first place, they generally do not
do so just for experimentation.)  Viagra will not alter feminizing hormones.

<p>
Hormones are not generally utilized in order to get the 'experience' of
living as a female.  They are used to make the medical transition to
another gender, after the subject has already experimented with living as
that other gender.
