Did you say "leadership when Singularity hits"?

Subject: Who cares


<p>
Ok, folks, I can't stand this much longer!!!

<p>
I don't care whether I'm talking humans, &gt;Humans, gals, guys, whatever,
we're all on the 'bleeding edge' regardless.

<p>
The 'powers that be' are going to stomp us flatter than dried elephant
shit unless we take care.

<p>
For once and for all:' The Ideas Expressed in this Group are
<br>
_Subversive_ !!!!'<br>

<p>
Governments are _not_ going to respond rationally to the technologies
that we expect, people (in general), are going to be caught _totallly_
unaware and _we_  must be able to provide some sort of leadership when
the Singularity hit (~10-20 yrs hence).

<p>
And if you think I'm over optimistic about the time frame, look to your
latest postings for guidance, things are progressing even better than I
(an unabashed technophiles) might have predicted.

<p>
I don't have a lot to contribute to the  truly productive discourse here
<br>
<a href="3527.html#3690qlink1">_but_  I feel that I have a good, overall, grasp of the issues, and that</a><br>
grasp tells me that that we're in for 'stormy weather'.

<p>
Please forgive my '60s take on the current scene but also _please_ don't
discount it completely.
