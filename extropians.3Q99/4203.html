From: "David Lubkin" &lt;lubkin@unreasonable.com&gt;

<p>
<a href="4198.html#4203qlink1">&gt;Watching the storms heading up the coast reminded me of the old</a><br>
<i>&gt;science fiction dream of weather control.  Assuming that we keep</i><br>
<i>&gt;this planet, and people still want to live on it, the weather will</i><br>
<i>&gt;still be a factor in a nanotech, space-faring, AI/IA future, as</i><br>
<i>&gt;will earthquakes, volcanos, etc.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4198.html#4203qlink2">&gt;Given quadrillions of sensors and lots of computational power, how</a><br>
<i>&gt;far in advance can we predict severe or extreme weather and </i><br>
<i>&gt;seismic events?</i><br>

<p>
Unfortunately we've known since 1963 that long range weather
forecasting on this planet is impossible (chaos). As I recall from
the formulas, if we placed a pole every square foot, with sensors
every foot to the top of the atmosphere, we could manage something
like 50% accuracy over 30 days. like a good formula, it allows us
to determine how accurate we can be now, at our current level of
instrumentation, 60% as I recall, over two and a half days. I
believe most major meteorologists are between 55% and 60% on
average....not bad!

<p>
The problem is that there is to much volatility in a single cubic
foot of air. (observe cigarette smoke sometime....)

<p>
To bad the rest of the population doesn't realize this, they need
better press agents.

<p>
The source for this as I recall is James Gleick's book "Chaos".


<p>
<a href="4198.html#4203qlink3">&gt;How can we divert or dissipate them?  </a><br>

<p>
<a href="4198.html#4203qlink4">&gt;The only idea I've ever heard is somehow using strategically</a><br>
<i>&gt;placed, low-yield, clean nuclear weapons, either for earthquakes</i><br>
<i>&gt;or for tsunamis.  What would happen if you sent a terawatt power</i><br>
<i>&gt;beam from orbit to the eye of a hurricane?  Can we use our</i><br>
<i>&gt;advanced warning and automatically move all structures out of</i><br>
<i>&gt;range?  Are there natural planetary forces strong enough to damage</i><br>
<i>&gt;a diamondoid beanstalk?</i><br>

<p>
A clean nuclear weapon? (oxymoron)

<p>
There was an idea a long time ago to release hydrogen balloons
which would be exploded to disrupt a tornado, I don't know how far
the research got.

<p>
The real problem is atmospheric volatility, and the so called
"Butterfly effect" the notion that small differences in initial
conditions have dramatically different effects.

<p>
<a href="4198.html#4203qlink5">&gt;Beyond dealing with crises, can we have true weather control? </a><br>
<i>&gt;How? With how fine a resolution in space and in time?</i><br>

<p>
doesn't look good at this point.
