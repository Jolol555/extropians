While I certainly agree with you Kathryn that we can do a much better job of
creating a welcoming environment for women in our group, I think the
discussion about "female genetics and longevity" is a legitimate one that's
by and large been carried out in a fairly objective way (although some of the
side-bar comments in the discussion have been a little rough).  Any group
that's keenly interested in human behavior and genetics, as we are, has to
make itself aware of current research and theories about human evolutionary
psychology.  For instance, I can't recommend enough Howard Buss' (now
somewhat dated, but still very good) book "The Evolution of Desire" as
offering insights into the reproductive and inter-sexual behavior of the
human animal.  I agree that such discussions should be carried on in a
diplomatic fashion, since they touch on a topic of great potential personal
sensitivity, but the subject itself is surely one that's quite proper for our
group.
