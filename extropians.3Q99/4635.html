<p>
I would like to take a moment to express some appreciation for the manner in which many have conducted recent debates that have taken place on the transhumanist lists.  

<p>
It was evident that people were actually reading each others postings carefully and in large part responding to their content rather than engaging in personal attacks.  Even if that response takes the form of a stiff challenge, a call to en guarde prior to crossing blades, that in itself expresses a level of respect towards the other person.  To read another's words carefully and formulate a response takes time out from other worthy activities and so is not an action taken lightly.  

<p>
I myself have learned much from these debates--I have discovered some new avenues of thought and have strengthened some of my own ideas to withstand another's questioning of them.  I can only hope that I have made a similar contribution in our discussions.
