<a href="0369.html#0407qlink1">&gt;Carl Sagan has been an enormous influence on my thinking.  _The Demon</a><br>
<i>&gt;Haunted World: Science As A Candle In The Dark_ is a book I refer to often.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Most of my reading early on had been biographies and autobiographies and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Herman Hesse, Anais Nin, Gertrude Stein, Ayn Rand, Simon de Bouvoire, Oscar</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wilde, Georgia O'Keefe, etc.  This gave me a foundation for life and</i><br>

Re nonfiction influences: In elementary school I borrowed a book called "The 
Third Millennium" from a teacher and was riveted.  I encountered Toffer's 
"Future Shock" shortly after and I haven't been the same since.  Sagan's "The 
Demon-Haunted World" is exquisite, as is "Pale Blue Dot," possibly Sagan's 
most speculative book.  Ayn Rand resonated with me right away, and I've since 
developed an interest in utopian societies and alternative social structures. 
 John Taylor Gatto's essay "The Seven-Lesson Scoolteacher" had a 
devastatingly authentic impact on me.  When I learned what cryonics was all 
about, things started picking up fr me, intellectually.
