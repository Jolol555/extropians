About like oxygen relates to metabolism, perhaps? I would want to focus that 
question a bit before saying anything substantive about it (an example of 
dialectics :-). 

<p>
How will dialectics change (improve) in the &gt;H future? Dialectics refers 
generally to the art/science of reasoned argument, and culturally at any 
given time it is about questions at the boundary of logic, questions we find 
in some way difficult to reduce to logic. That's why dialectical questions 
from many years ago sound quaint. When the participants in a discussion agree 
on "enough" premises, they can presumably draw some conclusions by logic on 
which they agree.

<p>
<a name="1985qlink2">Most of our discussions today don't require better logic[1], they require 
better communication about premises. Perhaps in the future, &gt;H intelligences 
</a>
will tackle problems that require both. I have trouble envisioning the shape 
of this, it's too many levels up from where I am. 

<p>
Some questions that go around endlessly, like abortion and gun control, are 
examples of irreconcilable premises and inability to agree on the facts 
("lies, damned lies, and statistics"). Actually, they are that at their best; 
sometimes there's just a refusal to use logic on one side vs. a refusal to  
abandon it on the other.

<p>
Other questions recur generationally and individually. Everyone has to 
confront Socrates and develop their own answers to some of his vexed 
questions, like "what is the good?", no matter how quaint it sounds.

<p>
I seem to have written a capsule summary of an answer to "why is philosophy 
hard?" Tune in next week for "Why is philosophy easy?" followed by "Why is 
philosophy bullshit?" &lt;grin&gt;

<a name="1985qlink3">Postscriptum: I expect sapients will always enjoy conundra. Questions that

<p>
[1] I completely rethought this after re-reading the whole post. Depending on 
subject matter, there are valid questions of proper application of logic, and 
there actually are questions that send us off in search of specialized logics 
such as multivalued, temporal, or fuzzy logic. The statement as given isn't 
demonstrably false :-) so I left it in and put the digression in a footnote.
