&lt;&lt; When we as Extropians question
<br>
 the value of aging and death, or of God, people see that as an
 attack; when we expound the virtues of boundless expansion of
 technology to those whose lives are committed to nature, they see
 that as an attack; when we question the value of our physical
 bodies and brains in favor of uploaded &gt;&gt; ( snip)
&lt;&lt;

yeah and a lot of people are working hard right now on changing the tone of 
our arguments to include and educate people -- making huge strides. Since 
this is so - rather than intimidate, condescend and berate them for being 
old-fashioned, we invite them to study things we love.
 
<p>
There's a whole new field of transhumanism opening up around this area, and I 
hear nothing but good things about Greg Burch's talk at Extro about how to 
present ideas in a way that allows people to feel included and open to our 
ideas.

<a href="5093.html#5096qlink1"> &gt;&gt;Similarly, when I question the value of long-held beliefs like</a><br>
 "politeness" or "restraint", I am not surprized that this is
 interpreted as an attack &gt;&gt;

<p>
Sounds so 'holier than thou!!!!'
<br>
You're missing the point. Why on earth are you insisting you are being 
"superior" by ignoring politeness and  being honest? 

<p>
Little kids do that all the time, naturally!!!
(It's cute in kids.. maybe not so cute in a grown man...)

<a name="5104qlink1">It's your insistance that we are somehow not capable of understanding your 
point that gets people pissed. The extropian list isn't a bunch of catholic 
Martha Stewart nuns, you know.</a>

<p>
<a name="5104qlink2">You ignore the good arguments for being civil and kind,  and keep saying how 
good you are to have evolved way beyond us. (By now I've ascertained that you 
like to get reactions of this type anyway)  and you seem to have forgotten 
that you are *posting* to Extopians@extropy.org,. so you're not talking</a> to 
inferiors.

It's smug self satisfaction that is annoying to people, 
not a quest for honesty and self-responsibilty.
