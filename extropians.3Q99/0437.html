At what time do you count the defects?  And what is a 'defect' exactly?

<a name="0446qlink2">I'm thinking more along the lines of Apple's Opendoc, RIP.  The components
only make up apps at the user-end.  At the moment a programmer can employ
bits of Office or IE into his apps but the user can't do the same.  If I
have a spellchecker in Office and I want to use it in my mail program I
can't.  In both my mail program and Office I'm using text, I'm writing in
English, and yet unless the programmer has hardwired the ability</a> to use the

simple thing.  In order to do this the UI would have to be created on the
fly and you would need strict rules for how components are designed.
