<i>&gt; approach.</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you're interested in getting smarter, you may as well rub cod liver oil</i><br>
<i>&gt; on your nads in my opinion.</i><br>

Yeah, IQ tests may ONLY make you better at IQ tests. I think this is
unlikely. As I mentioned before, IQ tests are designed to work your brain in
various respects - those repects which people would generally agree relate
to "intelligence". Some if not all of your new skills are going to be of use
in some respect to everyday thought. To propose that IQ test training will
have no effect upon the mental facets it monitors, is to say that you cannot
learn to become more proficient at IQ tests, which you certainly can. Some
brain optimisations/enhancements will be made as this proficiency is
attained. Do you really think that the IQ test is so irrelevant that the
skills it calls upon will NEVER be required in everyday life?</a>
