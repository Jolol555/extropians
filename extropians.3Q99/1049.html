Funny, those are almost exactly the words I used to describe trying to
stop or slow down the Singularity.

A suggestion bordering on the absurd.<a name="1101qlink1">  Uploading becomes possible at

Transhuman AI becomes possible at 2020 CRNS.  Nanotechnology becomes

possible at 2015 CRNS.

uploading themselves for 20.  Synchronized Singularity simply isn't feasible.

<a href="1042.html#1049qlink3">&gt; Exactly!  I've been promoting all along IA instead of AI.</a><br>
