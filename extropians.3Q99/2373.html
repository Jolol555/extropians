yep.

<p>
The experiment used NASA's biggest (helium) balloon to take
a Japanese instrument into the upper reaches of the atmosphere.
The instrument detects anti-protons among the cosmic rays
arriving from outer-space.  Space is so empty that the anti-particles
created in highly energetic events (supernovas, star collisions, etc),
if they escape, can reach the Earth's atmosphere.  When they (or the
other non-anti-particles hit one of the air molecules they
produce a cosmic-ray shower of particles.  Most of these
are absorbed before they reach the ground.  The ones that
hit you are part of the normal background radiation that
to some degre is responsible for cancer.

[More than you wanted to know I bet... :-)]

Cosmic rays are mostly the nuclei of atoms that have been
accelerated to high velocities with a few anti-protons
thrown in.  The experiment is trying to find "anti-helium"
(since an anti-proton is effectively "anti-hydrogen").
Such a finding might be an indication that some galaxies
could be composed entirely of anti-matter.<a name="2375qlink1">  If such a
galaxy were to collide with a normal-matter galaxy
</a>
the fireworks would be quite amazing.
