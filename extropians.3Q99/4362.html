I agree that exponential growth can't go on for 10,000 years.  But
on simple economic grounds, it is not clear there is any "problem".
If growth rates can't keep up, the cost of resources to grow with gets
higher and higher, and people then forgo more and more growth, relative
to other things.  Growth slows to a halt, but life goes on.

<p>
If people can consume their star, rather than just collecting its light,
they have to choose whether their civilization will burn bright but fast,
or burn slow but long.  But again, it is not clear there is any "problem."
If those who want to burn fast pay for it, then those who wanted
to burn slow will remain with what the fast-burners couldn't buy.
