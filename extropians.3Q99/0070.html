Hi!

<p>
I disagree. Emotions are not rational. In fact, instinct and emotions are
what help us make decisions when we have no rational thinking. So, emotions
cannot be guided by reason.</a>

<a href="0052.html#0070qlink2">&gt;        Personally, I would opt to exorcise any trace of fear or anxiety.</a><br>

<p>
If they're here is because they're useful. Fear in, for example, a war is a
very useful feeling because it helps you keep yourself alive; it's better
to live in shame rather than die in honor. Anxiety is also useful because
it catalyses our strenghts to a goal; I agree it's not always useful but I
understand it's purpose.

<p>
Yes, it is interesting. However, there are drugs in the market that make
you feel happy. Have you tried them?<a name="0123qlink2"> I'm very confident and optimist and I
think these are very important feelings that people than do not possess
them should have.</a>

<p>
Hasta.
