    interisting. do you think that violence is inherently bad? as a martial 
artist (and i know at least several others on this list are also), i really 
must say that violence isnt inherently any worse then antibiotics, or a 
hammer. its a tool, like money, influence, or a pair of tweezers. tools (and 
violence is a most abstractly defined tool) can not be good or bad. what they 
are going to do, and whats done with them, is what value judgements are based 
on...
<p>
    what kind of violence are you talking about, anyway? what angle are you 
coming at this from? domestic violence? animal cruelty? gun control?* murder? 
killing in general? systematic killing in general (war)? or just 
suffering-states of all sorts?
<p>
    ive gotta say it: i think that the most efficient, real-world-doable, way 
to cut down on violence of all 31 flavors would be to legalize pot, followed 
shortly by various other victemless crimes... &lt;/rant&gt;

  <li>  no, im not trying to start something! its a legit question. please dont 
induce suffering-states on me for this, dammit... they would be undeserved, 
and most unproductive.
