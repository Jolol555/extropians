<p>
I've noticed several casual mentions recently of the idea that spacefaring 
civilizations might die off for one reason or another.  Since I've yet to 
se an even halfway-plausible explanation for how this could happen, I've 
decided to issue a challenge:

<p>
<a name="1285qlink1"><a name="1275qlink1"><a name="1242qlink1">I hereby challenge anyone to come up with a disaster, natural or 
<a name="1227qlink1">artificial, that could reasonably be expected to render an advanced 
spacefaring species completely extinct.</a></a></a>

<p>
For purposes of clarification:
<br>
<a name="1233qlink1">1) The target civilization is assumed to have self-sustaining colonies in 
several solar systems spread across a volume of at least a few dozen cubic 
light-years.</a>

<p>
2) The target civilization is assumed to have advanced robotics, genetic 
engineering, non-sentient AI, and other such technologies.  Just to give 
exterminators a sporting chance, we'll pretend that nanotechnology and 
sentient AI don't exist.</a>

<p>
3) The target civilization is assumed to be at least as intelligent and 
diverse as modern-day humanity.  So let's not see any proposals that rely 
on them all making exactly the same idiotic mistake at the same time.

<p>
4) A proposed extinction event must be consistent with current astronomical 
knowledge (i.e. either it would be invisible to us, or it is something 
we've seen).

<p>
Challenge format:
<br>
Just post your proposal.  I'll reply with a specific explanation of how the 
target civilization could survive and rebuild, without recourse to 
ultratechnology or contrived foolishness.  If you stump me, I'll post a 
message saying so.  If you don't think my survival plan would work we can 
make a thread out of the argument (and we'll let the list judge which side 
makes more sense).

<p>
Are there any takers?

<p>
