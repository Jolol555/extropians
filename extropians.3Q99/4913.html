<a name="4917qlink1"> Correlation is not sufficient to establish causation. Judith Harris's book
The Nurture Assumption provides a fairly compelling argument that the
correlation you observe is primarily the result of the genetic similarity
between parent and child, and that very little of that correlation is due
to the effects of parental behavior on the children's psychological
development.</a>

<p>
<a href="4406.html#4913qlink2">&gt;&gt;  The societies of most 3rd world countries look pretty functional</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  to me, hardly "collapsed."  Street children that manage to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;  survive are mostly pretty well integrated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Well, we have a fundamental disagreement about a lot of this.  I won't do the </i><br>
<i>&gt;common thing of challenging your personal knowledge of the circumstances of </i><br>
<i>&gt;life in the Third World.  Instead, I will simply say that it seems obvious to </i><br>
<i>&gt;me that the circumstances of life in most of the Third World appear to be </i><br>
<i>&gt;miserably inadequate: Despite the fact that there is plenty of food in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;world, there are hundreds of millions of underfed people; despite the fact </i><br>
<i>&gt;that there is no shortage of information in the world, there are hundreds of </i><br>
<i>&gt;millions of people who are illiterate and ignorant; despite the fact that </i><br>
<i>&gt;there exist tools for creating peaceful societies, there are hundreds of </i><br>
<i>&gt;millions of people in the world who have no security in their lives or </i><br>
<i>&gt;property.  These are facts not subject to doubt by well-informed and rational </i><br>
<i>&gt;people and the contrast between the societies in which such conditions exist </i><br>
<i>&gt;and those in the First World is no accident.</i><br>

<p>
 To the extent that you are claiming that these problems could be reduced by
better parenting, I think The Nurture Assumption disproves your position.
