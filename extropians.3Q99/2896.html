<p>
<a href="2848.html#2896qlink1">&gt;Thank you, Waldemar, for bringing up these questions.  I can</a><br>
<i>&gt;add a couple of 'dangers':</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;1.  I agree with the 'delegation' concern.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2.  There is a sort of 'guru' or 'genius' mentality that we need</i><br>
<i>&gt;to resist.  Some are trying to bill themselves as 'geniuses',</i><br>
<i>&gt;and some are actively annointing others as 'geniuses'.  None</i><br>
<i>&gt;of us has the last word on this area of thought.  I think that</i><br>
<i>&gt;we need to reach out to each other to do more mentoring and more</i><br>
<i>&gt;collaborative work.  I see far too little nurturing of young</i><br>
<i>&gt;thinkers and far too much competing with them.  (Or, if it is</i><br>
<i>&gt;happening, it's happening among the men, but see number 3)</i><br>

<p>
Indeed, I am trying to nurture the younger generation in the Swedish 
Transhumanist Association (GAAAAAAASP, the younger generation, we've become 
old, old men Anders;-)

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="2848.html#2896qlink2">&gt;3.  It is nearly the year 2000.  The world's populations, by</a><br>
<i>&gt;any measure, are increasingly linked and racially mixing.  Gender</i><br>
<i>&gt;power is shifting to a more 50/50 balance.  Look around at your</i><br>
<i>&gt;groups, however, and ask yourself if we reflect that.  Ask yourself</i><br>
<i>&gt;what you are doing to reach out to and support the few women</i><br>
<i>&gt;who show interest, or someone who is racially different.  Just</i><br>
<i>&gt;having them around means nothing if they are not fully engaged.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2923qlink2"><a name="2900qlink1">I do not agree with you, Kathryn. Let me explain.</a>

<p>
</a>Is the above really interesting?<a name="2900qlink2"> We should be looking out for good prospects 
in general, without looking for a specific gender (what are genders going to 
be in the future, probably intersexuality</a> or serial gender), race (hey, I am 
a mix of Swedish, Italian and Norwegian), age (we should have more 500 year 
<a name="2900qlink3">old members, agree</a> to that).

<p>
<a name="2923qlink3">Otherwise we will lock ourselves up in a way of thinking that prioritizes 
these things. And they simply are going to have problems keeping up the 
</a>stereotypical cathegories that political correct builds itself upon. Really, 
<a name="2923qlink5">having served as a PC "house nigga'" in the Liberal Party I say that being 
specially treated is no fun at all, its a form of racism.</a>

<p>
<a name="2923qlink4">Isn't it better to honestly, and in a well packaged way, present the ideas 
to people and treat everyone that's interested like a person?</a> If that means 
that we are going to be composed by 110% male (MUY macho) or 93% WASP or 
perhaps 89% portuguese, lesbian, gun-crazy libertarians- so be it!

<p>
I think people come to us because they are not cathegorized or 
stereotypized, eventhough they may be even ostracized in mainstream society.


<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
Waldemar Ingdahl
