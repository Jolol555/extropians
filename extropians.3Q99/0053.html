<a name="0549qlink1"><a name="0122qlink1">0. If I can replace the emotion FEAR with a "WARNING: DANGER" function which
<p>
   works as fast (=at a low level) as FEAR does, then I would replace it.  I
   regard any person irresponsible who simply removes FEAR without replacing
   it with some other safeguard.

<a name="0122qlink3">  <li>  I did not know that humans sort LONELINESS into the EMOTIONS cathegory.
   I believed they defined LONELINESS as the property of a person who belongs
   to a set consisting of only that person.  What kind of EMOTION would you
   suggest such a person senses?
</a>

  <li>  Most of the emotions of the emotion complex LOVE energize the mental states
   and thus I would wish to retain them, although under continued rational
   control.

  <li>  I would remove the darker spectrum of EMOTIONS which appear in  DEPRESSION
   states, and install a rather positive emotional balance.
