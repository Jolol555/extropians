<p>
&gt;&gt;Our QC cannot by definition /record/ its observation (or even the
&gt;&gt;fact that it made one), because that would be irreversible,
 
<p>
<a href="2434.html#2459qlink1">&gt; That's why the document he signs just says the electron went through one</a><br>
<i>&gt; and only slot but it doesn't say which one. The observer knows but then</i><br>
<i>&gt; the memory of the outcome of the experiment is erased, it's brain is put</i><br>
<i>&gt; into exactly the same state it was in before the experiment; if Copenhagen</i><br>
<i>&gt; is right this will have no effect and we will still not see interference,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but if we do...</i><br>

<p>
&gt;&gt;so we are forbidden from assuming that it /made/ an observation;
 
<p>
<a href="2434.html#2459qlink2">&gt; The observer told us he did and he's a reputable scientist, besides</a><br>
<i>&gt; we can always repeat it with others.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2464qlink1">That's my point: the observer /can't/ tell us anything.  Ever.
The act of doing so violates reversibility.  Your "document" is
part of the state of the observer, and it has to be reversed</a> too
or the experiment is meaningless (which it is anyway).   That's
<a name="2464qlink2">no different from putting ordinary recording gadgets at the
slots: the pattern goes away, and we get a simple result.</a>  Just
because you put a "mind" in between the slots and the recorder
doesn't change the fact that you're recording.  If we insist
that the observer maintain quantum coherence and be reversed,
then /no measurement is ever made/, and no document is ever
produced to tell us about it.
