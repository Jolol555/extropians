I would agree that a completely top-down approach looks questionable.
However, a co-evolving human brain linked to an external "sub-program"
generation system might be interesting.  "No, not the 'libertarianism
elimination algorithm' you silly computer, we need a 'dogmatic
libertarianism elimination algorithm'".</a>

<a name="3378qlink5">Since the "Intelligence" part of this may be context specific,
I suspect that we will not get recognizable intelligence unless
humans are involved in the feedback loop.  For example, I can
imagine a context (say "crystalline environments") in which
the ability to form random patterns would be viewed as
"higher intelligence".  We, however, would not recognize it as
such.  "Intelligence" if it relates to "ability to survive"
is going to be highly context dependent.</a>

<p>
I have to disagree.  While "exponential" enhancement may require
uploads, I think you can get quite a bit of human enhancement
with nanobots and high bandwidth links.  The question is this --
Which is harder, interfaces between the thought patterns of unique
uploads and the external reality or the development of useful message
passing protocols between your existing brain and external subroutines?</a>

<p>
<a name="3378qlink7">I'll invoke the catch-22 principle -- uploads don't exist, so</a> people
<a name="3378qlink8">are unlikely to work on reality interfaces; reality interfaces don't
exist so people won't upload.  On the other hand "brains" do exist,
"nanotechnology" will exist (for uploading or Intelligence Augmentation),
so the path of "external" brain enhancement seems to be more probable
than uploading followed by exponential enhancement.

Why?  Unless you are remarkably young looking for your age
(or you had a body substitute at the Extro4 conference :-)),
brain vitrification is unlikely to benefit you as much as
work on intelligence augmentation/interfaces.  Unless
you are taking a highly pessimistic/covering all bets
approach.
