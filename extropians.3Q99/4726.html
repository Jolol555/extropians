<i>&gt; &gt; counted?</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; It's just gun laws?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Considering that my state, New Hampshire, which was</i><br>

<i>&gt; before europeans</i><br>
<i>&gt; arrived, also has very permissive gun laws, and has</i><br>
<i>&gt; a significan</i><br>
<i>&gt; percentage of the population that hunts actively,</i><br>
<i>&gt; versus its immediate</i><br>
<i>&gt; neighbor, Massachusetts, which also has a decent, if</i><br>
<i>&gt; not quite equal</i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of wilderness and wildlife. Mass has strict</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun laws (to even own</i><br>
<i>&gt; a BB airgun you need an FID card) that inhibit or</i><br>
<i>&gt; discourage hunting,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and most property is posted against hunting. Crime</i><br>
<i>&gt; is at least ten times</i><br>
<i>&gt; higher in Massachusetts than in in New Hampshire,</i><br>
<i>&gt; despite nearly equal</i><br>
<i>&gt; population densities. Vermont and Maine are much</i><br>
<i>&gt; like NH or even more</i><br>
<i>&gt; so, while Mass is much like Conneticutt, Rhode</i><br>
<i>&gt; Island, and New York</i><br>
<i>&gt; (upstate NY tends to be somewhere in between.)</i><br>

<p>
There is crime rate info at:

<p>
 <a href="http://www.justicefellowship.org/local.htm">http://www.justicefellowship.org/local.htm</a>

<p>
 This has crime rates per 100k, both total and violent
crime. While the rates are higher in the states you
mention, they are not "ten times higher", more like a
factor of 3 (bad enough) for violent crime, and about
1.5 for total crime.

<p>
<a href="4657.html#4726qlink2">&gt; You could say that crime is caused by urban compact</a><br>
<i>&gt; zones, sort of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; old rat experiment writ large, but from what I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; seen the crime comes</i><br>
<i>&gt; as a response to busybodies trying to make life</i><br>
<i>&gt; miserable for as many</i><br>
<i>&gt; other people as possible with as many laws and taxes</i><br>
<i>&gt; as possible. Cities</i><br>
<i>&gt; with the most laws and taxes have the most crime...</i><br>
<i>&gt; duh....or else that</i><br>
<i>&gt; city has cops on every street corner... martial law.</i><br>

<p>
It's not just population density only or necessarily.
Cities have many other differences from rural hunting
grounds. There is general stress level, noise,
economic pressure etc.

<p>
 What is the correlation between taxes and violence??

<p>
 Either trigger happy cops or trigger happy citizens,
neither is any good.
