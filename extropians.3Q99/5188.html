I thought Gina's pointer to recent work on ribosomes was very impressive,

It's amazing to think of the ribosome (which translates RNA into proteins)
as a molecular machine with many moving parts.  Probably there are other
cellular components which will turn out the same way.  This should give
additional credibility to nanotech (if it needs any more).  Our cells
are full of tiny, active machines, not just passive chemicals that bump
together.
