<a href="0987.html#1084qlink1">&gt; As I've pointed out before, uploading is much, much more difficult than </a><br>
<i>&gt; most of its proponents seem to realize.  You are better off concentrating </i><br>
<i>&gt; on neural interfaces and cybernetic brain enhancments.  If you go that </i><br>
<i>&gt; route you can get your first intelligence enhancements long before </i><br>
<i>&gt; uploading would be possible.  You also get to make the upload a gradual </i><br>
<i>&gt; transition, rather than an either/or proposition.  By the time a complete </i><br>
<i>&gt; human upload is possible you should already have a significant fraction of </i><br>
<i>&gt; the population running mostly in software, with their physical brains being </i><br>
<i>&gt; merely one of many specialized computational devices.</i><br>

<p>
Sure, full agreement here.<a name="1091qlink2"> I wasn't claiming that uploading would 
somehow be "simple" though, quite on the contrary: exactly because
it's (presumably) harder than creating a conscious AI, we should
put extra effort into it, while at the same time strongly discouraging 
</a>
attempts to make conscious machines.<a name="1091qlink3"> By "uploading technology" 
I meant the entire spectrum of neural interfaces/ enhancements etc. 
which could make our brains more efficient and less organic, btw,
not<a name="1370qlink1"> (just) a single, "instantaneous" procedure that would</a> transfer
one's thought into a computer. I'm strongly in favor of the gradual 
approach, as opposed to the scanning method where 
</a>
essentially a "copy" is being uploaded.
