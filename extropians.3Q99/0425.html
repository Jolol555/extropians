<p>
Total number of defects found / total lines of source code in the project.</a>
If you want more detail you can break the numbers down by code module, by
project phase, or however else you want to (assuming you collected the
appropriate details in your defect reports).

<p>
Measuring code quality this way makes it pretty easy to tell whether your
quality is improving, declining or staying the same.  The numbers will tend
to do strange things if you change programming languages, but since
virtually all commercial applications are written in C++ these days that
isn't as big of a problem as it might be.

<p>
<a href="0421.html#0425qlink2">&gt; The problem is not large programs but unecessarily large programs.  This</a><br>
is
<br>
<a href="0421.html#0425qlink3">&gt; due to the application-based paradigm.  The idea that you have a word</a><br>
<i>&gt; processor and each new release has extra features, and all these extra</i><br>
<i>&gt; features add bloat.  This is equally true of commercial software and the</i><br>
<i>&gt; open source community.</i><br>

<p>
I'll take a "bloated" program with tens of thousands of features over a slim
program with a few hundred any day.  So will most other people, which is why
such programs sell.  If you prefer the small programs, you are perfectly
free to do your word processing in vi, WordStar for DOS, etc.

You might find <a href="http://www.slate.com/webhead/99-07-06/webhead.asp">http://www.slate.com/webhead/99-07-06/webhead.asp</a>
interesting.

<p>
<i>&gt; A move to component-based software could remedy</i><br>
<a href="0421.html#0425qlink4">&gt; this.  But to make coponent-based software work you need to remove the</a><br>
<i>&gt; programmer from the hardware and the interface, and that isn't going to</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen anytime soon.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0437qlink2">Actually, it is the standard way of doing things for the more advanced
PC-based software companies.  Microsoft in particular has been pushing hard
to reach this goal.  Did you know that Office 2000 is simply a big
collection of COM objects with a set of GUI programs sitting on top?  If you
know how, you can re-use these components in your own code.

<p>
There is also a substantial industry in re-useable components, most notably
represented at <a href="http://www.componentsource.com/">http://www.componentsource.com/</a>.
