almost always sitting in a different node so they have to send

<p>
<a name="0629qlink5">They can't do it simply because performance on current architectures 
would suck monumentally. You would have to emulate things, and context 
switches on current hardware/software architectures are just a tad too 
expensive for that.

<p>
<a name="0629qlink6">Multithreading!=asynchronous message passing on many tiny objects. 
We're talking about several thousands primitive (few kBytes) objects 
which send message packets which are routed by hardware directly -- 
while the originator code may or may not wait for the ack/result 
to arrive. If this exists at all, it is academic curiousity at best 
(Thinking Machines might qualify, though I really doubt they exploited 
<a name="0629qlink7">their options fully every time). You certainly can't program these 
</a>
things in standard languages as C/C++ with any efficiency. And I would 
just love to see a programmer who can handle concurrent nonlinear 
control flow in a distributed kObject application. This can get
arbitrarily hairy.

<p>
There's a dearth of apps even for Beowulfs, and god knows how
coarse-grain these are. No sir, don't think so.

<p>
<a href="0508.html#0602qlink2"> &gt; you can run a large app over a distributed architecture like this without</a><br>
<i> &gt; having to explicitly modularize it to fit the hardware's quirks (see</i><br>

<p>
Sure you can. Put x86 opcode sofware emulation into every node, 
equipartition the old-generation binary over the nodes and send 
a message to the appropriate node whenever PC leaves your node's 
address space slice. Redundant as hell (OS nanokernel+ x86 
emulator in every node) and efficient as treacle since purely 
sequential, especially considering that you can't do 4 kCPUs 
PIII/550 way, and interpreting/compiling existing code into 
SWAR *would* require true AI.

		       Better yet, the
                       system builds on the existing Windows operating system,
                       so today's software won't become obsolete and
                       programmers can write new software the same way they
                       do now, for one machine or many.

Right. And pilots will worry about pig collision avoidance issues.

<p>
Looks nice as a concept, but even if it works it is no panacea. Will
alleviate migration psychologically since suggesting you can run your
apps on the new platform even if in reality you can't.

<p>
<a href="0508.html#0602qlink4"> &gt; But that isn't especially relevant, anyway.  I was talking about programming</a><br>
<i> &gt; techniques for existing PC hardware.  Obviously, radical changes in hardware</i><br>

<p>
Of what possible relevance is existing PC hardware/programming
techniques to uploading? I am not sure we're talking in the same
language here.

<p>
<a href="0508.html#0602qlink5"> &gt; can require equally radical changes in programming methods.</a><br>

<p>
And even worse: vice versa.
