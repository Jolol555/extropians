The physicist Richard Feynman was one of the greatest geniuses of the 20'th
century and when he was in high school he had an IQ test. He got a mediocre 125.
<a name="1903qlink1">The best definition of intelligence that I can think of is " the sort of thing
that Richard Feynman did"</a>  therefore the disgrace can not be Feynman's,
it's the advocates of the test who should feel embarrassed.

Years later after he became famous and won the Nobel prize the people at
Mensa wrote to him and begged him to join, he took great delight in telling
them that he could not, he just wasn't smart enough.
