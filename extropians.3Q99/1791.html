<p>
At Extro-4 a few people were wondering what became of the Idea Futures
<a name="2081qlink1">project that was presented at Extro-2. The software we developed eventually
became the Foresight Exchange (FX), located at <a href="http://www.ideosphere.com">http://www.ideosphere.com</a>.
I've written an article about our experiences with it that was published in
Extropy Online, available at <a href="http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/fx.htm">http://www.extropy.org/eo/articles/fx.htm</a>
</a>

<p>
Our plans for commercializing the software didn't come to fruition as we'd
hoped, but some of us are once again considering making a serious go of it.
Besides the FX site, the software has been used in trials in industry and
academia and powered the IF market that the Foresight Institute ran at a
recent senior associates' gathering.
