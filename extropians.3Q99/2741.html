For some reason, lawyers (especially tort lawyers) have been fascinated by 
the Darwin Awards since the beginning of the net.  So I receive these from 
many, many sources.  Over the years we've speculated on the reality of the 
stories in my office and, eventually, we found a site that delves pretty 
deeply into the urban legend status of the stories:

As you'll see, many (in fact most) of the stories aren't true.  They're 
entertaining, nevertheless . . . [why am I responding to this thread when 
I've got dozens of messages in my in box to which I haven't responded?]
