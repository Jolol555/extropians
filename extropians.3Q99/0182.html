Freeman, are you coming to Berserkely August 7 for Extro 4?  Ill bring
my set and clock if you wanna rattle off a few fivers.  You will likely
whip my fanny: peaked out at about 1900 several years ago.  Now
probably ~1800 on a good day.  {8-]

Chess programs are the first task I know of which passes the Turing test.
Using modern chess software, one cannot tell if one is playing against
a computer or an ass kicking human. [This fact killed postal chess.
People quit playing after computers got better than humans, which
happened in the 90s.]  Any other examples?  spike
