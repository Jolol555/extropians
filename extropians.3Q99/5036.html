<a name="5071qlink1"><a href="4895.html#5036qlink1">&gt; In my roleplaying scenario there is a situation just like this: a new</a><br>
<i>&gt; colony planet, colonized by colonists using advanced automation and</i><br>
<i>&gt; AI. There are currently 300 people on the entire planet (and many,</i><br>
<i>&gt; many more AIs), with a grandiose capital and several outlying</i><br>
<i>&gt; settlements, holiday resorts, monuments and an internet with a huge</i><br>
<i>&gt; bandwidth. The AIs simply build more stuff to amuse themselves ("Let's</i><br>
<i>&gt; make a Mount Rushmore out of that mountain range!  We can put images</i><br>
<i>&gt; of all the colonists on the rockfaces... hmm, maybe we could carve in</i><br>
<i>&gt; our own source code while we are at it!" "The Mary Infiltration</i><br>
<i>&gt; Project could of course work out of New Stockholm, but why not build</i><br>
<i>&gt; it a base of its own? I'm itching to try out the Stalinist style on</i><br>
<i>&gt; the Northern tundras."). It's rather fun to describe this</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Mega-Brasilia" - empty highways, grandiose gardens, a 400 floor</i><br>
<i>&gt; skyscraper built like an exponential function with just a single</i><br>
<i>&gt; office in use.</a></i><br>

<p>
Why are there only "300 people"?  What is a person in this scenario,
anyway?  Why are there "colonists"?  There could just be a probe that
landed, and constructed people as they were needed for the civilization
it was building.

<p>
<a name="5071qlink2">I'm not saying this would be a good thing.  I'm asking whether there is
a place for "people" as we know them in this scenario.</a>  Wouldn't people
be just another resource to allocate and deallocate,<a name="5071qlink3"> like heap space,
as they were needed or desired (by what, I'm not sure)?</a>

reply to all -- I'm not on the extropians list anymore as of today.
Maybe later when I get my email filters working.
