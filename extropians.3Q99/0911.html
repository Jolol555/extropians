<a href="0908.html#0911qlink1">&gt; Sorry to hear that.  This is one of the more stressful work cycles.  I've </a><br>
<i>&gt; been taking melatonin since it came available in the health food market.</i><br>
<i>&gt; I </i><br>
<i>&gt; have noticed that if I stop taking my 3mg. per day, I get a major energy </i><br>
<i>&gt; boost sometimes that lasts for about a week.  Then I get very tired.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Don't be sorry about it yet - we are hoping its a good thing. 8 hours to
yourself (call volumes are very low, but someone has to be here just in
case), nice fat internet connection, a fully equipped office environment,
and peace and quiet during the day to snooze - this may be very positive.
Especially since we are trying to get a serious on-line concern off the
ground (The Land Canaan, our musical gift to (trans/post)humanity) - lot's
'o' hours with nought (almost) to do but "surf the net dude", it does solve
some problems. And you get paid.

If Jodie doesn't lose her mind, it should work out rather well. If...
