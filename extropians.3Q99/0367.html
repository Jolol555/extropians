Not if the vehicle were a few dozen meters across. However I have thought of a vehicle
which could behave as UFO's are described, and entirely within current physics. The
entire vehicle would be a mass of nanites that are formed into the saucer shape for
aerodynamic and stealth purposes. The core of the vehicle might be a usable crew cabin,
but the rest is a dense type of utility fog, where the nanites can form a honeycomb of
capillaries in the desired direction of travel/propulsion. The nanites will impell
individual air molecules through the capillaries to high velocities. Using this sort of
jet propulsion through most of the cross section of the vehicle will reduce or
eliminate shock waves. Once into space, they can form into either light sails or
magsails, with the ability to store and expend energy borrowed from the orbital
momentum of stars themselves around the galaxy (which after billions of years of use
would cause them to fall far enough inward to crunch into the central black hole) via
use of their electromagnetic fields and a smart use of slingshot orbital mechanics. A
simple fission thermal system could be used to maintain a magneto hydrodynamic system
to maintain the magsail into interstellar space.
