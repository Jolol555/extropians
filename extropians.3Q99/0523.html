I've been using my new Linux box for about a week. It's a dual
celeron300A, overclocked to 466Mhz. I picked this system to optimize
</a>
processing horsepower per dollar. Sure, dual PII450s are faster for
some applications, but they are a lot more expensive, and the
celerons are faster for other applications. The Celerons have
less cache, but they access the cache in one front-side bus cycle.
the PIIs have more cache, but they access the cache in two bus cycles.

<p>
I didn't use a dual-celeron motherboard. I used a dual slot 1 board
instead.
<br>
This means I can convert over to PIIs or PIIIs if intel should ever
inadvertently manufacture a cheap, overclockable version as they did
for the Celeron. To use the celeron in a slot 1, you first place the
celeron on a "slocket". Works great.

Why is this Extropian? well, It shows that computers are getting very
fast and very cheap. This is helping to drive the astounding
proliferation
<br>
of Open Source software. At this point, the only reason to buy
software is inertia, or if the software is extremely specialized.
This may be a model for an "Open Stuff" economy that could occur
with Drextech.
