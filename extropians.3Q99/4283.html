<a name="4288qlink1">Very interesting.  While I see the logic of the argument, I would
have to say the suit was on iffy ground here.  The premise
is that someone under 15 can't give consent.  I have a hard time
with the argument that a 12 year old boy who gave "non-legal"
consent *repeatedly* should not be held responsible for his
actions.  The man in this situation is trying to worm out of
his responsibility on a technicality of the law.  Now the
interesting part would be that I would say the man has a
case for a huge civil suit against the woman for raping him.</a>

<p>
<a name="4288qlink2">Legally the guy was raped, but in looking at this you have
to believe he knew what he was doing.  Only if you can make
an argument that he thought the storks brought babies can
you make a case that the state is victimizing him.</a>

<p>
Its interesting that the way the rape &amp; consent laws are setup
they are trying to prevent this type of thing from happening
(16 y.o. minor woman seducing 12 y.o. minor boy).  But since
he didn't scream "rape" to his parents, he made his own bed.

<p>
<a name="4305qlink1">When I used the term "raped", I meant it in the more classical
sense of "forcing" a man under gunpoint to have sex.
