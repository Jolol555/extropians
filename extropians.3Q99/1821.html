My comments on Extro4:


<UL>
  <li>  I liked the location.  I also like hotels, but if we
  can attract speakers and have more attendees by doing it
  at a college I'm all for it.  Theater facilities were
  good.

  <li>  I preferred the more eclectic mix of topics of Extro3
  rather than the focussed approach of this one.

  <li>  The gene patents session should have been a real debate.
  Just because you couldn't find a Rifkinite doesn't mean
  you had no one to argue the opposing side--many of us
  would have been happy to do that.  Indeed, I think an
  Extro ought to have at least one good debate on some topic
  of real controversy among Extropians; it keeps us from
  stagnating philosophically.

  <li>  A more detailed program would be nice.  Names/URLs for
  the speakers and related resources, more details about
  the sessions, etc.  Would also be an opportunity to
  exhibit artworks (drawings/writings).

  <li>  You're missing a great capitalist opportunity by not
  having more merchandising.  Extro3, for example, had a
  lot more book sales--why none this time?  Natasha is
  right that arts get something of a short shrift among
  technical folks: so stop talking about it and put some
  more of it in our faces.  Give us the opportunity to see
  it and touch it and buy it. 

  <li>  The short open-mikes worked well.  Perhaps a longer
  session of those would be interesting.


</UL>
