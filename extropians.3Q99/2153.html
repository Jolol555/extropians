  The first study below finds that very-high doses 
  of melatonin produced dose-dependent short-term 
  memory deficits possibly via the same mechanism
  that Valium-class drugs (benzodiazepines) impair 
  memory. The doses were equal to .6 to 6.8 grams
  for a 150-lb subject, very high! Interestingly, 
  and fortunately for melatonin consumers, the 
  second and third studies below found that 
  endogenous melatonin and exogenous doses of 
  melatonin in the standard-dose-range actually 
  facilitated memory. The forth study supports the 
  hypothesis that melatonin may be beneficial in
  the treatment of Alzheimer's disease in part
  by reducing the accumulation of beta-amyloid.

Many of the pharmacological effects of melatonin 
have been found to be similar to those of
benzodiazepines. In the present study, we analyzed 
the role of melatonin on short-term memory retrieval 
on transfer latency in elevated plus maze and food 
consumption behavior, and the effects were compared 
with those of diazepam. Melatonin dose-dependently 
<br>
(10-100 mg/kg) produced short-term memory deficit <br>
and it potentiated diazepam- (1 mg/kg) induced 
cognitive deficit in mice. Flumazenil (1 and 4 mg/kg) 
could reverse enhancement in diazepam-induced memory 
deficit by melatonin. Chronic treatment with melatonin 
<br>
(10 mg/kg/7d) produced a similar profile in transfer <br>
latency on elevated plus maze compared with that of 
diazepam. In a food consumption behavior study, 
melatonin (25 and 50 mg/kg) produced a significant
hyperphagic effect compared to control. Flumazenil 
<br>
(4 mg/kg) could significantly reverse the hyperphagic <br>
effects induced by diazepam (2 mg/kg), but would 
be insignificant with regard to that due to melatonin. 
These findings provide further evidence that some of 
the pharmacological effects of melatonin are 
comparable with those of diazepam and may involve 
central GABAergic mechanism.

Melatonin facilitates short-term memory.

The olfactory social memory test, based on the 
recognition of a juvenile rat by a male adult 
rat, was used to investigate whether melatonin 
influences memory. Intracerebroventricular 
<br>
(i.c.v.) injection of 1.1 nmol melatonin <br>
shortened recognition time, while the melatonin 
ML1 receptor antagonist luzindole (1 nmol) 
exerted the opposite effect. The facilitating 
influence of melatonin was abolished in the 
presence of 0.5 nmol luzindole. The findings 
suggest that endogenous melatonin facilitates 
short-term memory.

Melatonin effects on sleep, mood, and cognition

The effects of immediate-release melatonin on 
circadian rest-activity profiles, cognition, and
mood were investigated in ten elderly individuals 
with self-reported sleep-wake disturbances. 
Melatonin (6 mg), administered 2 hr before habitual 
bedtime, enhanced the rest-activity rhythm and 
improved sleep quality as observed in a reduction 
in sleep onset latency and in the number of 
transitions from sleep to wakefulness. However, 
total sleep time was not significantly increased 
nor was wake within sleep significantly reduced. 
The ability to remember previously learned items 
improved along with a significant reduction in 
depressed moods. No side effects or contraindications 
were reported by any of our participants during the 
10 day trials. These data suggest that melatonin can 
safely improve some aspects of sleep, memory, and 
mood in the elderly in short-term use.

TITLE: Monozygotic twins with Alzheimer's disease 
treated with melatonin: Case report.

ABSTRACT: Monozygotic twins with Alzheimer's disease 
of 8 years duration were studied. The onset of the 
disease differed by about 6 months between twins and 
was characterized by a primary impairment of memory 
function. Clinical evaluation at the time of diagnosis
indicated a similar cognitive and neuroimaging alteration 
in both patients, as well as a similar neuropsychologic 
impairment. A possible genetic origin of the disease was
suggested by a similar disease suffered by the mother. 
Patients were initially treated with vitamin E 
<br>
(800 I.U./day). Starting at approximately the same time <br>
(about 3 years ago), they received 50 mg/day thioridazine<br>
because of the behavioral and sleep disorder. One of the 
patients was treated with melatonin (6 mg orally) at bed 
time daily for 36 months. Evolution of the disease in the
melatonin-treated patient indicated a milder impairment
of memory function, with substantial improvement of 
sleep quality and reduction of sundowning. This led to
discontinuance (after 3 months) of thioridazine treatment.
Present clinical evaluation indicated a difference in
functional stage of the disease between the twins 
<br>
(Functional Assessment Tool For Alzheimer's Disease, <br>
FAST), with a score of 5 in the twin who received 
melatonin and of 7b in the twin who did not receive it. 
Since experimental data on melatonin in animals indicated 
its antioxidant, antiapoptotic, and beta-amyloid-decreasing
activity, the hypothesis that melatonin has a beneficial 
effect in Alzheimer's disease patients should be considered.
