<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; To understand the indivisibility of consciousness, consider that when water</i><br>
<i>&gt; freezes to make ice crystals, a millionth of a degree short of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; temperature necessary for crystallization results in no crystallization. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; phase transition from water to ice occurs only when the temperature goes all</i><br>
<i>&gt; the way to freezing. Another phase transition occurs when water changes to</i><br>
<i>&gt; steam. At sea level (with exact barometric pressure) this means the</i><br>
<i>&gt; temperature of the water must reach all the way to 100 Celsius. If it misses</i><br>
<i>&gt; by a millionth of a degree, the water does not boil.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Similarly, the phase transition from attentiveness to full consciousness</i><br>
<i>&gt; occurs when 100% of cerebration crystallizes as pure awareness. Just as we</i><br>
<i>&gt; use magnetic material to detect magnetism, so we need conscious intent to</i><br>
<i>&gt; detect consciousness. Unconscious entities cannot know of our existence. "It</i><br>
<i>&gt; takes one to know one."</i><br>

<a name="1551qlink1">It seems to me that you look at consciousness as a monolithic entity</a> as opposed
to a phenomenon
<br>
<a name="1551qlink2">that is composed of the sum of many parts, such as crowd of people,</a> a flock of
birds or the weather.
<br>
<a name="1551qlink3"> My analogy was meant to relate the consequences of loss</a> of an infinitesimally
<a name="1551qlink4">small part of such a phenomenon.</a>
<br>
<a name="1551qlink5"> Of what consequence is the loss of one starling to a flock of millions?
 Of what consequence is the loss of one person in the behavior</a> of the population
<a name="1551qlink6">of Columbus, Ohio ?
<br>
 Of what consequence is the loss of one rain drop in a cloudburst</a> ?
<a name="1551qlink7"> Maybe the loss would be noticed, the mayor dies, but the life</a> of the city goes
on.
<br>
<a name="1551qlink8"> As someone who daily looks at the effects of brain damage, injury, tumors,
Alzheimer's, etc. on the level of consciousness of real live people, I am
continually amazed at the amount of brain loss that it takes to make a
significant change in perceptible behavior.</a> There are folks walking around,
<a name="1551qlink9">functioning normally, who have 1/2 the brain mass of your average Joe.
 They present a great argument in favor of the holographic theory of
consciousness. Of what consequence is the loss of 1/1000000</a> of a hologram to its
<a name="1551qlink10">ability to reconstruct the image that produced</a> it ?
