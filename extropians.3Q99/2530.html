For actual companies working on air car and jet pack technologies, see:

<p>
<a href="http://www.moller.com">http://www.moller.com</a> for an air car about to be tested in prototype form.
For $5,000 you can reserve a delivery slot when they go into production.
This is basically a VTOL airplane; it remains to be seen whether they are
able to make it work.

<p>
<a href="http://www.rocketmaninc.com">http://www.rocketmaninc.com</a> has a jet pack with two trained pilots
available for hire.  The pack is not for sale, presumably requiring too
much training and risk.  Both pilots are stunt men with many skills.
One is an accomplished skydiver, which would undoubtedly come in handy
if the engine quit in mid-flight.  They have some blurry video (requires
Java) which shows a number of impressive flights.
