Space Messengers Offer Eternity For a Fee

<p>
You send an e-mail to a computer in Davis, California. It, in 
turn, forwards the message to another computer a few feet away.

<p>
It sure doesn’t seem like anything to pay $10.95 for.

<p>
But Greg Snow, 40, president of Bentspace.com, is hoping 
you’ll give him your credit card number for the opportunity.

<p>
The catch: as that computer passes your message along, it’s 
doing so with a parabolic antenna that also hurtles the signal, 
and your message, into space.
              
<p>
Snow calls it "a gateway to the cosmos."

<p>
The space-related novelty gift industry has traditionally 
thrived on trinkets, like astronaut pens and patches, and 
mock real estate deeds to cosmic bodies.

<p>
But a new breed of companies that promise to send your name, 
message, or image to space, has recently begun popping up. 

<p>
Space messaging companies hope to capitalize on the mystique 
of space and a human desire for adventure and eternity. The 
appeal of signing one’s name across a pioneering space mission, 
or having a personal signal travelling the heavens in perpetuity, 
has caught the attention of entrepreneurs.

<p>
There's also the hope that a faraway being may someday come 
decode the messages.

<p>
"I think it’s human nature to want to leave your mark on the <br>
cosmos," Snow says. "It’s a message in a bottle."

<p>
In July, Dojin Limited purchased room for its "digital 
passenger" CD-ROMs on what could be the first private-sector 
space exploration mission. For $54.95, Dojin will save your 
photo and some text onto the CD-ROM, which will travel with 
the spacecraft to a near-Earth asteroid.

<p>
"Represent the human race," its Web page coos. "Your place in <br>
eternity awaits you."

<p>
But profits are still to come. Snow and his four partners, 
for instance, have shelled out about $70,000 for Bentspace. 
If it’s any indication of hopes for success, Snow hasn't quit 
his day job.

<p>
"I have no expectation, I really don’t," says Snow, who also <br>
runs an online computer shop. "My experience with the Internet 
leads me to not even know.  We’ll see if it does capture the 
public’s imagination."

<p>
Dojin President Richard Barrett III says the company has 
already made several thousand sales, but needs 10,000 to 
break even.

<p>
Another space messaging project begun by French artist 
Jean-Marc Philippe offers to put your message, in digital 
form, on a capsule that would be launched in 2001 and 
programmed to return to Earth 50,000 years later.
                
<p>
Unlike the others, KEO, as the mission is called, is free. 

<p>
Phillipe writes on KEO’s Web site that he hopes the mission 
will serve as a "globally appealing metaphor that would help 
ignite … universal reflection."

<p>
Fifty-thousand years, he adds, is "a distance in time that 
is so vertiginous and mind-boggling that it compels us to 
abandon our normal points of reference and puts us all on 
equal footing, forcing us to reach down into our imaginations 
or deep convictions."

<p>
To a degree, KEO has succeeded. The mission has drawn entries 
from 86 countries, and has been featured by CNN, Reuters, and
Discover magazine.

<p>
NASA also offers its own program, plainly named "Send Your 
Name to Mars." On a special Web page, you can have your name 
included on a CD-ROM that will travel on NASA’s Mars Explorer 
mission, scheduled for 2001. 

<p>
Like KEO, it’s free. But there is some question about how that 
one is going to work. It seems the data on NASA’s CD-ROM will 
be destroyed by solar radiation unless it is shielded, and no
decision on that has been made just yet.

<p>
The space agency may have been the first to complete this kind 
of mission.  On January 3, 1999, NASA sent more than 930,000 
names on a CD it attached to its Mars Polar Lander.

<p>
That mission proved that message-bearing spacecraft appeal 
to more than just space buffs and science fiction devotees. 
NASA’s offering, which was initially geared towards kids, was 
opened to all after adults started bombarding the site with 
requests, according to John Lee, the administrator of
the program. 

<p>
Such broad interest may explain why for-profit companies are 
sprouting despite competition with free programs with virtually 
the same offerings.

<p>
Still, space messaging is, in essence, a specially-marketed 
variant of modern-day electronics. Many phone and television 
signals use satellites for transmission; a satellite used 
for Internet service may even have brought you the words of 
this article.

<p>
But this hasn’t stopped Bentspace, which sends its first 
message on August 17. As for why anyone would pay $10.95 to 
send some bytes of data into space, the company curtly replies: 

<p>
"Each of us will have our own reason. And that's reason enough."<br>
