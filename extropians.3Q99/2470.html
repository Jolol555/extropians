The comet impacts would not only melt the poles but add their own water mass
to the environment as well. If we were to employ nuclear weapons to melt the
poles there would be the side effect of a radioactive "dead zone" which
could last for millenia (if not longer). At the very least we would
introduce radioactive fallout into the Martian environment, since at the
heart of any H bomb there is a Plutonium or Uranium trigger that would leave
some "dirty" effects behind.

<p>
Teh important thing to do is ADD water to Mars so you could use it to help
thicken the atmosphere when it evaporates.

<p>
<a name="2576qlink9">In a magazine article (the title escapes my memory at the moment)
terraforming Mars is discussed in some technical detail and part of the
scenario was using comets to increase the water mass. Then factories which
produce large ammounts of CO2 as a by product woudl be set up with the
workers (humans) living in bio-domes or underground. Large solar mirrors in
orbit and on the ground would help raise the temperature.</a>

<p>
When an atmosphere of CO2 reached a barometric level simmilar to the high
alpine regions of earth high altitude connifers could be planted adn start
the CO2 - O2 cycle as the factories and humans continued to produce CO2.
Eventually the humans would be able to venture out onto the Martian surface
with less and less protective equipment. They could go from full pressure
and temperature suits at the start of the program to low pressure thermal
suits within a few decades and then within 200 years people could walk on
the surface without any protection at all, except durring winter.

<p>
<a name="2576qlink10">My timeline may be a bit off from the article (I'm going from memory here)
but as we approach the "singularity" we coudl develop new technologies that
could concievably speed up this process to take a total of a few decades.</a>
<a name="2576qlink11">The initial timeline is assuming we use the technology we have available
today. The main innovations that are needed to get the ball rolling are
transport infrastructure (getting there and back efficiently), habitation
(where the people live while this is going on) and life-support (efficient
methotds for generating food, water, air and electricty). Economy is
something I'll leave up to...</a> economists.

<p>
<a name="2576qlink12">The other concerns raised are worthy of consideration but pointless if the
task is too daunting or restricted by paranoid governments affraid of
humanity getting out from under their thumbs.</a> = ) Even if private industry
wants to and can afford to do it, current<a name="2576qlink13"> governmental controls (especially
those imposed by the US) must be lifted or nothing will be allowed to
</a>
happen. If a government doesn't want something to happen, it's damn hard to
make it happen, they have the power and the guns to back themselves up.

<p>
Just my two cents....
