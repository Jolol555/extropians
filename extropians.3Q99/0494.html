<p>
I'd like to continue to encourage participation in the Timeline to 2020 
project:

<p>
      <a href="http://crit.org/http://www.textropians.com/Timeline/home.htm">http://crit.org/http://www.textropians.com/Timeline/home.htm</a>

<p>
(That's the CritLink URL to the project homepage).  I think we can get <br>
significant value from the project if you'll take the time to post even a few 
comments in the areas about which you feel you are most knowledgeable or have 
the strongest opinions.  Here's some previously posted material regarding the 
procedure for posting comments:

<p>
For now, all commentary should be through Foresight's Crit Link system.  
Links in the Timeline web pages will lead you to Crit's view of the site and 
give you access to the Crit tools for inserting your comments, ideas and 
projections into the project.  General comments on the specific developments 
can be tagged essentially anywhere in the text of the page or to the page as 
a whole.  

<p>
<a name="0520qlink1">Our goal of collecting specific projections for dates or ranges of dates when 
a development will become possible, available, common or ubiquitous requires 
a little care using Crit Link.  To tag a comment to a particular year in the 
timeline tables you will find at the individual development pages, it is 
necessary to paste in the particular year in the "target phrase" area and THE 
TEXT FROM THE WHOLE LINE OF YEARS into the "optional context phrase".  Thus, 
to tag a comment that you believe the development "Software Agents as 
Autonomous Actors" will be "Common" by the year 2020, you should paste the 
text from the year cell for that point ("2020 - C") into the "target phrase" 
Crit field and the text from the whole line for the year 2020 ("2020 - P 2020 
- A 2020 - C 2020 - U") into the "optional target phrase".  Although this 
seems a little kludgey, Crit requires the second step in order to have enough 
context to "know" where to place its meta-tag.</a>  Because Crit will open a new 
window for the commenting process, it's easy to flip back and forth between 
the project site and the Crit commentary page to grab the text you need to 
properly tag your comment.

<p>
We are also looking for feedback on improving the categories.  An example is 
battery technology.  None of us in the group that developed the site knew 
enough to come up with a good metric for developments in this area, so we 
only have an item called "Advanced Batteries".  If you can offer a refinement 
of an existing category such as this one, or a wholly new category that we've 
missed, use the links available at the site to make these kinds of helpful 
suggestions.
