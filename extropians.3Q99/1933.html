Im with you there Sasha.  It fits better with the extropian ideal,
for each person to decide what works best for them, and work
together toward a common goal, while furthering one's own
best interest.  So:  I propose a team, starting with GIMPS and
later moving to whatever we want, where there is no committment
expected or asked for.  Stop CPU waste!

For myself, should I win the EFF $100K, I hereby state my intentions
of donating the pile to Extropians.  [This written in a format more
permanent than ink on dead trees.]  May you all enjoy witnessing my
squirming, whining and gnashing of teeth, should I actually win,
and be morally obligated to fork over the loot.  {8^D  spike
