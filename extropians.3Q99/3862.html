<p>
But are there any barriers to *enabling* them?  I believe that there
was a recent announcement that scientists had discovered a collection
of 3-4 genes that in *adult* mice allowed wound healing to take on
the characteristics of "normal development" rather than "scar tissue".
If it doesn't involve dozens of genes, we already have the tools
(though they are somewhat unrefined) to turn them on or off.</a>

<p>
I suspect we will be able to "grow" them, however the really
difficult part will be connecting communication lines (nerves)
in functional ways.  That is likely to remain difficult.   However,
<a name="3907qlink4">the insertion of a neural-net mapping chip that is both "programmable"
and has a much higher training rate than normal neurons seems a reasonable
solution to this problem.</a>  So if we can grow them (in less than a
decade), I think technologies from foreign disciplines will solve
the functional augmentation difficulties.
