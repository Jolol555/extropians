    well, my take on this is fairly simple. my goal is to improve untill i 
deem myself knowledgable enough to make intelligent decisions about The Big 
Questions. once my consciousness is firmly in place inside a 
quantum-dot/m-brain/j-brain/whatever-turns-out-working-best (with a black 
hole projector set up for self-defense, of course), ill start contemplating 
questions like "what should i be doing with my spare time?". but untill the 
day that im firmly encapsulated, i dont deem myself qualified to do anything 
except become qualified. then i might start to think about "what its all 
about", or the true meaning of "42", or whatever...
<p>
    but untill that day, onward and upward! towards ascension! rally round 
the family! 54-40 or fight! 46 and 2! remember the almo! roughriders! dixie! 
for god and for gideon! over the top! die motherfuckers! (circa vietnam, 
1969) etc etc etc yada yada yada blah blah blah... =)

<p>
mine truly,
