Mead's art is still modern, no matter what year he did the work. Just like 
Frank Lloyd Wright is still 'modern', because his design philosophy is a hair 
a more advanced than most of today's architects (barring Prince, Kellogg, 
Niles and a few others). Same with Lautner, though it is retro it is still 
futuristic and in many ways unsurpassed. 
 
<p>
*My* definition of retro would imply reinventing a trend rehashed from past 
popular culture (i.e.: 70's polyester, lava lamps, peplum jackets, etc.) that 
is recognizable as old fashioned, hence: kitsch. Retro-future would also 
imply kitsch: ie clunky robots, divign helmets, etc.

<p>
Syd Mead's Tron is still a futurist design piece.Look carefully at  his 
drawings.The ergonomics work. So do his architectural and industrial designs. 
His work never made it into mainstream, even though many people saw Tron, 
they did not emulate it. Blade Runner was actually a "flop" in the eighties, 
and didn't become a cult classic until many years after. 

<p>
His work did not become mainstream and it has never been widely accepted. He 
represents Extropian views. His philosophy is not retro - it is forward 
thinking - promoting technology as friend not foe. He is still a futurist, 
even if some of his drawings were done yesterday.
