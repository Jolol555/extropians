<a name="0637qlink1"><a name="0634qlink1">My take on this subject is the same as I have towards, the existence of God,
life after death, heaven and hell</a> and re-encarnation. I cannot dismiss
people's experiences,</a> they may go to church and express  having a spiritual
moment (believe in a supernatural power), they may state they have memories
of a past life, or even gone up in a UFO. First of all, I myself have never
experienced any of these, but then again have no evidence that these claims
are false.<a name="0644qlink1"> I am humble enough to confess that I have not died, therefore
cannot say for myself if there is a heaven or a hell, if I have lived a past
life, I do not remember it, and I most surely have not traveled to every
planet in our solar system to know if there is life or death out there. I
leave myself open, I decide not to decide. I will await the facts. Because I
have seen nothing, does not mean there is nothing. It may very well be that
one day I will awake to some grey creature probing my body or that I will
die and God will damn me to hell, (oops) so although I do not pursue any of
these ventures, I also do not disclaim them. (just in case theres a limbo)</a>
