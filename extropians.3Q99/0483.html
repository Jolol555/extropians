<a href="0476.html#0483qlink1">&gt; As a sometimes temporary, sometimes permanent home to lemurs, our house </a><br>
<i>&gt; provides a great place for observing the "low end" of the primate spectrum.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Our newest addition, a three month old ringtail named Newton, just discovered </i><br>
<i>&gt; mirrors last night.  (At this age a lemur corresponds in lemur-terms to a </i><br>
<i>&gt; young toddler, I'd say.)  Like the others we've fostered or adopted before, </i><br>
<i>&gt; he immediately perceived the mirror as a hole in the wall with another lemur </i><br>
<i>&gt; on the other side.  Newton's social instincts kicked in and he instantly </i><br>
<i>&gt; jumped to go through the "hole in the wall" to interact with the "other" </i><br>
<i>&gt; lemur -- with predictable results.  Within seconds, he was involved in a </i><br>
<i>&gt; detailed exploration of this new phenomenon, making small movements and </i><br>
<i>&gt; watching the image in the mirror.  As with every other lemur I've watched do </i><br>
<i>&gt; this, Newton then settled into a session of absorbed staring into the mirror. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  What DIDN'T happen is behavior typically triggered by the presence of </i><br>
<i>&gt; another lemur, i.e. social signaling.</i><br>

<a name="0484qlink1">That's amazing, both that you live with lemurs and that they are able to
respond to mirrors in this way.</a>  If you come up behind them when they are
<a name="0484qlink2">looking in the mirror, do they know to turn around?
