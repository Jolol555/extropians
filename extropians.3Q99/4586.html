<p>
I'm not sure about the extropian mood, but overall the 11th and 12th
century were the high middle ages. A first technological revolution
began (spread by monks) as people began to build mechanisms such as
watermills and pumps. I think the major cathedrals began during this
era, although cathedral building on a smaller scale had gone on for
quite some time. Things went a bit downhill (a very subjective
judgement of course) in the 1200's and 1300's with a worse climate and
some plagues.

<i>&gt; so the whole notion was dismissed.  Am I mistaken?  spike</i><br>

<p>
My impression (and of course I might have been infected with an
erroneous meme even if I seem to recall fairly credible sources) is
that it does not help you prevent colds (which was what I think Linus
mainly claimed) but that it helps overcome the opportunistic bacterial
infection in the throat that usually follows. Anyway, it makes for
great placebo.
