That is a good point!  I think the difference with AI is that
we have a case where we are trying to figure out *how* to
build a DESIGNER factory factory, without often considering the
consequences of that [other than many dicussions in this group].  
Its also true that most AI research isn't done by a *business*.
The AI research which is done by a business is usually done
in the framework of "limited"-I, i.e. I want a widget that
understands speech, conventional programming does a pretty
poor job, lets try another approach.  There are people who
would dearly love to have a programmer factory factory,
they are called "managers", but you can be pretty sure
that the "manager" doesn't want a manager factory factory.
