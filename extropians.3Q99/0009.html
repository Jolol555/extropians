<a name="0082qlink1">As far as I'm concerned, speculators are a symptom, not the problem. The
problem with the stock market is that it's far from a free market; for
example:


<OL>
  <li>  Insider trading laws prevent the spread of accurate information required
   for sane investment choices.
  <li>  Capital gains tax means that many people stay in a stock well after they
   would otherwise have dumped it, in order to avoid tax.
  <li>  Various laws encourage people to invest money in the stock market which,
   in a free market, they'd have put elsewhere.


</OL>

<a name="0031qlink1">So all these restrictions encourage continual increases in stock</a> prices and,
<a name="0031qlink2">not surprisingly, speculators jump in and take advantage of that. And
</a>
politicians can use this to claim the economy is wonderful, all the while
just creating a hideous bubble which will eventually collapse.
