<p>
<a name="2896qlink1">Thank you, Waldemar, for bringing up these questions.  I can
add a couple of 'dangers':


<OL>
  <li>  I agree with the 'delegation' concern.  

  <li>  There is a sort of 'guru' or 'genius' mentality that we need
to resist.  Some are trying to bill themselves as 'geniuses',
and some are actively annointing others as 'geniuses'.  None
of us has the last word on this area of thought.  I think that
we need to reach out to each other to do more mentoring and more
collaborative work.  I see far too little nurturing of young
thinkers and far too much competing with them.  (Or, if it is
</a>
happening, it's happening among the men, but see number 3)

<a name="2923qlink1"><a name="2896qlink2">  <li>  It is nearly the year 2000.  The world's populations, by
<a name="2976qlink1">any measure, are increasingly linked and racially mixing.  Gender
power is shifting to a more 50/50 balance.  Look around at your
groups, however, and ask yourself if we reflect that.  Ask yourself
what you are doing to reach out to and support the few women
who show interest, or someone who is racially different.  Just
having them around means nothing if they are not fully engaged.</a></a>
