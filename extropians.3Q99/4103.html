<a href="4095.html#4103qlink1">&gt; I have a 2 and a half year old son and I'm trying to think of something</a><br>
<i>&gt; *interesting* to dress him as this halloween.  I'm looking for</i><br>
<i>&gt; something non-ordinary, a little bit smart ass, irreverent, or almost,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but not quite, inappropriate for a small child.  :)  Heh heh.  I want</i><br>
<i>&gt; people to think, "What the hell??", but not "You bastard!"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The costume must be relatively cheap and easy to build and put on.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Any ideas?</i><br>

<p>
How about dressing him up as grey goo? A grey, shapeless blob or perhaps
a globe covered with disgusting grey stuff. "What the hell"?! Oh wait,
that would probably just look like an ordinary anti-pollution
statement...Don't want to be mistaken for a tree-hugger, now.

<p>
Perhaps he could go as a Singularity. Hmm, how do you express the
unknowable?

<p>
Nah. Maybe he could dress up as a "Y2K bug" (bug outfit with Y2K on its
back/front) or something.
