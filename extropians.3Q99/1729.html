Deer see well into the ultraviolet, which is why deer hunting can be
difficult and unrewarding to the novice, as common clothing detergents
have color brightening dyes that make you look like a neon sign in
ultraviolet. They can see you coming from a mile away. They only have
yellow and blue cones in their eyes (no red cones) and they have no
ultraviolet filter in the cornea (as is normal for humans), plus they
have a reflective layer behind the receptors to reflect back through the
cells light that passed through without reception.

defective UV filters in their corneas....which could explain why people
struck by lightning report such abilities after their electric
experience, as the lightning bolt's high levels of UV emissions likely
burns out some or all of the UV filters.
