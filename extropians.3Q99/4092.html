Description
<br>
"I believe that 21st century technologies will allow the creation of<br>
"artilects" (artificial intellects, artificial intelligences, ultra<br>
intelligent machines), with intellectual capacities zillions of times
greater than those of human beings. I believe that this technological
possibility will force the issue of whether artilects should be built or
not. I believe that humanity will split into two major ideological
camps, one in favor of building artilects (the "Cosmists") and those
opposed (the "Terrans"). I believe that the ideological disagreements
between these two groups on this issue will be so strong, that a major
<br>
"artilect" war, killing billions of people, will be almost inevitable<br>
before the end of the 21st century. " Quote from Dr Hugo de Garis

[Oh yes, I couldn't agree more ;-)]

<a name="4123qlink1">Apparently you can join teams here, like:

<p>
Cosmists Team
<br>
Team in favor of ultra machine delvelopment; promotion and distribution.

<p>
Terrans Team
<br>
A Terran (based on the word "terra", the earth) is someone who feels
that artilects are too potentially dangerous to be built.</a>

<p>
Guess I am a Terran then, though it sounds a bit Luddite...
<a name="4150qlink1">Dr Hugo de Garis currently heads both teams</a> (?)
