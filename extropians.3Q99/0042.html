Ya that change was a shocker.

<p>
<a href="0014.html#0042qlink1">&gt; A coupla points- I'm sure you meant, higher pressure to keep the LOX</a><br>
<i>&gt; *above* the freezing point...</i><br>

<p>
Yup.  You only need a little pressure to keep the almost boiling lox from
freezing the ethane.  The phase overlap is only a few degrees F.

<p>
<i>&gt; and propane is a better choice than ethane</i><br>

<p>
My good friend and mentor has been telling me the same thing, he too
being a propane/lox fan.  I admit having a lot of headaches trying to
work out the density delta between lox and ethane.  You lose a lot
of the efficiency of a roton by going for the no-insulation-needed
approach of lox and ethane.  The bigger tanks may swamp the
advantage of the slightly higher Isp of ethane vs kerosene.  So,
pont taken.

<p>
<a href="0014.html#0042qlink2">&gt; As for two rotary engines- remember that low pressure engines have</a><br>
<i>&gt; only a trivial (less than 1%) Isp hit in vacuum, with the same</i><br>
<i>&gt; expansion area ratio.  Make the upper stage pressure fed.</i><br>

<p>
Again, a favorite idea of my friend and mentor here.  I have resisted
the pressure fed notion because rotary engines are wicked cool, but
thats a poor reason to choose one I fear.  {8^D

<p>
<a href="0014.html#0042qlink3">&gt; If you put back the insulation between the tanks, you can Vapack</a><br>
<i>&gt; both propellants (use their vapor pressures to drive the fluids),</i><br>
<i>&gt; eliminating helium bottles, regulators, and heaters altogether.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt; RCS runs off the vapors left after the main engine burn.</i><br>

<p>
Do you mind if I share your post with the guys?  These are good points.

<p>
<a href="0014.html#0042qlink4">&gt; There are a few still grinding away... I feel this would be great</a><br>
<i>&gt; for freight, and with an escape rocket on the crew cabin, could be</i><br>
<i>&gt; used to haul people.</i><br>

<p>
Ya.  What I really had in mind is a low cost 2 stage designed specifically
for low-value high-density payloads, which one is willing to risk, such
as food for astronauts.  My notion is to leave the humanity hauling duties
to the space shuttle.

<p>
Thanks for the ideas!  {8-] spike
