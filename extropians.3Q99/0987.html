most of its proponents seem to realize.  You are better off concentrating 
on neural interfaces and cybernetic brain enhancments.</a>  If you go that 
route you can get your first intelligence enhancements long before 
uploading would be possible.  You also get to make the upload a gradual 
transition, rather than an either/or proposition.  By the time a complete 
human upload is possible you should already have a significant fraction of 
the population running mostly in software, with their physical brains being 
merely one of many specialized computational devices.</a></a>
