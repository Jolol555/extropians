<a name="1538qlink1"><a name="1509qlink1">Over the past few years, I have been daydreaming about starting a journal
of ideas, such as 'Exquisite Corpse' or 'The Objectivist', a journal that
focuses on the art and craft of the essay.  I hear so many wonderful ideas
expressed by you folks that never seem to make it to print.  Well, it is
time to make the daydream a reality!  

<p>
Please join me in inaugurating THE TRANSHUMANIST, a periodic journal of
ideas for the transhumanist community and general readers alike.  It will
be disseminated in the form of an electronic newsletter, and can be easily
downloaded for distribution in print form.  Frequency of issues may be
monthly, depending on submission rates.  This journal will reach core
transhumanists, as well those who have developed some interest in
transhumanist topics but who are reluctant to subscribe to the listserves.  

<p>
Each issue of THE TRANSHUMANIST will be a short collection of essays, each
of 4-20 paragraphs, that might:</a></a>
<br>
1.  relate transhumanist thought to a topic of current interest (such as
the cloning of Dolly or the completion of the fruit fly genome)
2.  comment on a current topic within the transhumanist networks, such as a
<a name="1509qlink2">recent paper in 'The Journal of Transhumanism' or summarize a hot</a> debate on
one of the lists
<br>
<a name="1509qlink3">3.  express a personal reflection on how transhumanism relates to your own
life or work
<pre>
4.  introduce a new idea as a starting point for discussion
5.  review a new book 
6.  anything else I haven't thought of above--queries are welcome!

</pre>
<p>
Standard disclaimer:  The editor (at this point, me!) reserves discretion
over the material printed within THE TRANSHUMANIST, as well</a> as the right to
<a name="1509qlink4">edit materials for grammar, spelling, and standard English useage.  Works
may be archived online or in print form at a later point in the future.</a>  If
<a name="1509qlink5">authors wish to retain copyright over their works, please include a
copyright statement.

<p>
FIRST ISSUE DATE:  projected for the end of August/beginning of September

<p>
TO SUBSCRIBE:  send me an email!

<p>
So, dig through those hard drives and the dusty corners of your</a> brain where
<a name="1509qlink6">the interesting ideas always seem to land.  If you have an idea and need
help with editing, please don't hesitate to ask.  

<p>
Looking forward to hearing from everyone,

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
