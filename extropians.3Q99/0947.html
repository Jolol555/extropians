<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink9">&gt;is artificial or not.  Everyone else, it seems, has been there already and</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0956qlink3">I don't think it's a matter of certainty, but, in all likelihood, the Face
is what the recent higher resolution photos have shown it to be, i.e., just
a artefact of lower resolution imaging.</a>  I don't know about becoming a
scholar of the subject...  I mean, by the same<a name="0956qlink4"> token, should one also
</a>
examine every case of the Virgin Mary appearing -- on the off chance that
the latest one might actually be for real?

<p>
<a name="0956qlink5">It's not a matter of sticking with the status quo...  Surely, some people
who reject your views are doing just</a> that...  But to use "status quo" is not
going to advance this discussion.  After all, if the polls are correct,
there are large numbers of people who do believe in UFOs, alien abductions,
etc.  They are part of the status quo too.  They have their magazines, their
journals, their experts, their culture, their in group...

<p>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink10">&gt;I've said before that it's neither my intention nor my hope to "change</a><br>
<i>&gt;anyone's mind" re. the "Face" (which, I should reiterate, is but one of the</i><br>

least

"keep
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink12">&gt;an open mind" crowd were a bunch of self-contradictory kooks.  You can't</a><br>
keep
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink13">&gt;an "open mind" about everything.  You _can_, however, keep a kind of mental</a><br>
<i>&gt;gray basket for phenomena for which you have insufficient evidence.</i><br>
There's
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink14">&gt;nothing wimpy or un-extropian about this, and it's certainly as divorced as</a><br>
<i>&gt;can be from the "I Want to Believe" mentality (with which my stand on</i><br>
Cydonia
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink15">&gt;has been confused by several reportedly intelligent people).</a><br>


<p>
Fair enough.

<p>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink16">&gt;Fact:  Throughout Cydonia there are bisymmetric formations perched on</a><br>
crater
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink17">&gt;rims, without any sign of being affected by impact ejecta (in fact, they</a><br>
look
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink18">&gt;quite sharp and relatively "new"-looking).  These features (the "Cliff"</a><br>
<i>&gt;feature to the far right of the "Face" and sharing its orientation, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Crater Pyramid," farther south and easily the tallest structure in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;100-mile radius), are set at right angles to their respective craters.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Faulting, etc. has been ruled out.  Whatever these things are, they formed</i><br>
<i>&gt;_after_ the meteor impacts.  How?  This is an unanswered question, and one</i><br>
<i>&gt;that doesn't involve tedious bickering about facial resemblances and</i><br>
pattern
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink19">&gt;interpolation (as valid as this discussion can be when done</a><br>
democratically).
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink20">&gt;Prediction:  List members who don't know what the hell I'm even referring</a><br>
to
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink21">&gt;will inundate this list with "skeptical" griping (and will probably work in</a><br>
<i>&gt;the word "crackpot" while they're at it).</i><br>


<p>
<a name="0956qlink6"><i>&gt;From the photo I saw -- published in _Science_ and elsewhere -- this did not</i><br>
appear to be the case.  The features did not look all that regular.
Granted, they were not totally irregular, but the bilateral symmetry was
only rough.  Point me to a sight which shows a better photo...</a>

<p>
<a name="0956qlink7">Also, cratering is not the only way to make surface features -- even on
Mars.  Thus, the alternatives aren't either it's a crater or some
intelligent being(s) made</a> it.

<p>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink22">&gt;The bottom line is that there is reason to seriously consider possible ET</a><br>
<i>&gt;ruins on Mars.  The "Face," at this point, becomes almost immaterial, the</i><br>
tip
<br>
<a href="0945.html#0947qlink23">&gt;of a vast iceberg of unprecedented weirdness that has yet to be explained</a><br>
<i>&gt;geologically.</i><br>

<p>
The short of it is this.  It's a whole world.  Imagine if instead of living
on Earth, we lived on Mars and then started sending probes to Earth, say, a
billion years ago.  We'd spot a world with lots of things that could be
classed as "unprecedented weirdness" such as plate tectonics.  Imagine
<a name="0956qlink8">Martians trying to explain Earth's geology when all they had</a> the bias of
<a name="0956qlink9">first understanding Martian processes (which seem to point to a catastrphic
era of heavy water erosion followed by a longer drier period of mainly wind
erosion and, of course, cratering).  They might point the lack of craters as
evidence of intelligence at work...</a>

<p>
<a name="0956qlink10"><a href="0945.html#0947qlink24">&gt;Fortunately, we're dealing with objects we can demystify _this</a><br>
<i>&gt;year_, with the Mars Global Surveyor.</a></i><br>


<p>
<a name="0956qlink11">True.  Have any more photos come in on this yet?  (And to wake a sleeping
dog, have any more anamolous ones come</a> in?:)

<p>
<a name="0956qlink12">And speaking of which, Cydonia is one of my favorite trance artists.:)</a>
