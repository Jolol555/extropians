True.  Energy resources of the future that we can use will exceed
by many orders of magnitude (&gt; 10^5) what we actually require.

Yes, I understand the thermodynamics part, but I've never seen
anyone propose a real "physical system" that would allow the
efficient removal of the waste heat/entropy.  There are some
interesting suggestions regarding slow ballistic transport
and fast ballistic transport in Frank &amp; Knight (1997)
[<a href="http://www.ai.mit.edu/~mpf/Nano97/paper.html">http://www.ai.mit.edu/~mpf/Nano97/paper.html</a> {esp. Sect 7.1}],
but I've never seen anyone discuss the nuts and bolts of such an
approach.

<p>
While I agree that beaming the entropy into space is a great
idea, I'm under the impression that there are significant
losses when you attempt to drive energy "uphill" (say
from waste heat generated by nano-assembly, into light
light as laser emissions).  The best energy efficiency
that I know of for lasers is ~60%, and that is in diodes
lasers converting from electricity into light.  Unless you
can propose a system that is &gt;90% efficient at converting heat
into laser energy, I don't think your argument buys us much.

<p>
It is certainly true that we could circulate the heat in a
cooling fluid into the upper atmosphere, but one faces losses
here due to gravity and friction.

<p>
I really do think we are limited as far as planetary heat
production.
