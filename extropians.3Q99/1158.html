<i>&gt;From: Athena Andreadis </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  There are so many things wrong with this piece that it's unlikely I'll be</i><br>
<i>&gt;able to address them all without writing a book.  Perhaps I should, come to</i><br>
<i>&gt;think of it, before people start to believe that there is some basis to</i><br>
<i>&gt;this gibberish.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The first item actually concerns "welfare births".  In fact, if we are</i><br>
<i>&gt;hardwired for anything, it is for passing on the genes as early as</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible.  Therefore, the primary question is not bulges in the upper</i><br>
<i>&gt;versus the lower head, but the fact that in terms of fitness, endurance and</i><br>
<i>&gt;future longevity for childrearing teenagers are the prime breeding stock</i><br>
<i>&gt;physically, though not intellectually (there is an interesting theory about</i><br>
<i>&gt;this being the adaptive reason for the existence of human grandparents).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  The second item is that "intelligence genes", even if they exist (another</i><br>
<i>&gt;totally open question), have not been mapped ANYWHERE yet, let alone on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;X or Y chromosome.  So the evolutionary psychologists' "data" are in fact</i><br>
<i>&gt;fond personal wishes.  I'd like to know whose work they're quoting as</i><br>
<i>&gt;evidence.  Certainly no geneticist or molecular biologist that I know!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Now on to birth weights.  Statistically, girls tend to be born just</i><br>
<i>&gt;slightly heavier than boys.  Now as far as "male" and "female" programs go</i><br>
<i>&gt;(if we accept their existence), we have a fundamental error in logic in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;passage that Larry sent.  If we accept that males receive the program from</i><br>
<i>&gt;their mothers (on the X chromosome) and females from both parents, boys are</i><br>
<i>&gt;receiving the program that should go for easier delivery.  Girls would get</i><br>
<i>&gt;a mosaic because they randomly inactivate one of their two X chromosomes in</i><br>
<i>&gt;each and everyone of their cells.  That means that the so-called "program"</i><br>
<i>&gt;should cancel itself out in females.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  It is true that human brain size cannot exceed its present size without</i><br>
<i>&gt;either killing the mother or affecting the pelvic angle to such an extent</i><br>
<i>&gt;that she can no longer walk upright.  It is also true that the two human</i><br>
<i>&gt;genders may have slightly competing reproductive strategies, but I submit</i><br>
<i>&gt;that this is a cultural construct, not a biological one.  There is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;gender bias in our ape cousins; there is general infanticide starting with</i><br>
<i>&gt;the youngest (hence riskiest) offspring if there are environmental</i><br>
<i>&gt;pressures on the group.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; However, there is something that the writer of this stellar piece ignores</i><br>
<i>&gt;in his hurry to ascribe the stasis of human intelligence. to "female</i><br>
<i>&gt;bio-genetic problems".  If the human brain were to become even TEN PERCENT</i><br>
<i>&gt;larger, the neuronal impulses would have no time to integrate.  That's the</i><br>
<i>&gt;equivalent of the light speed limit in physics -- we'd have split</i><br>
<i>&gt;personalities for sure, let alone being able to coordinate our motion and</i><br>
<i>&gt;our autonomous functions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  I am tired of this venom.  People like that will undoubtedly be happy</i><br>
<i>&gt;with the onset of gender selection (already operating widely in several</i><br>
<i>&gt;countries, including the US -- read the latest in yesterday's NY Times</i><br>
<i>&gt;Magazine) and the artificial womb.  Then women will become either trophies</i><br>
<i>&gt;or curiosities in a zoo.  Perhaps better so, that be considered eternally</i><br>
<i>&gt;guilty for the "fall" of the race, re-incarnated now in</i><br>
<i>&gt;pseudo-science-speak.</i><br>
