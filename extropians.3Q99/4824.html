If pascal is driving a train to learn to drive a car, then C is learning to
drive by being put in the smash up derby, and C++ is learning the same by
being put in a pod-racer from Star Wars - The Phantom Menace!

Right on! Bryan apparently hasn't seen pascal since the early eighties. It's
like comparing QBasic to VB (which I do quite frequently as a low down
oratorical technique, which is reprehensible really, but then VB deserves
it).

<a name="4834qlink1">Actually, I'll agree that the most extropic language would probably be C
(C++ has had too many commitees involved to be in the running). But I'll
still support Delphi; it survives because it is such a powerful programming
tool, which has evolved from a long line of powerful programming tools which
were commercially successful because they were just really good.</a>

Eugene, you must be a native german speaker; forth could only appeal
strongly to people whose natural language uses reverse polish notation! Just
kidding, I love rpn myself, I have a section of my brain devoted to rpn
which can never be reused. I I forth in programmed have never admit.

To get back to the original "free tools finally available" topic; if you
really need free, then you can always go off to unix/linux land, or there's
always DEBUG (ha ha).
