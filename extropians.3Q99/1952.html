We have a study/proposal group that is working on exactly this,
but perhaps for a different reason.  For profit.  {8-]</a>  Actually,
we want to ensure that a stray rock from space does not trigger
world war 3.  If an asteroid were to be identified and we had
a few years to plan a strategy (as with the 2028 Earth grazer)
there exists a plan to deal with that.  There is a planned radio
array that will eventually map all major asteroids and their predicted
paths, but I dont have a URL for it.  spike
