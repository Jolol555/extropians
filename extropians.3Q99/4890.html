Mayhaps.

Professor Ted Williams at Keele University in the UK has developed
a solid state memory system with a capacity of several times more
than is possible using current hard disks. The system is based on
the magneto-optical technology used for reading CD-Roms, and
has a capacity of 86GB per sq cm. However, it uses a different
operating approach. As the new high data-density substrate used
can be put on virtually any surface, the applications for the system
include computer and processor memory, particularly with palmtops,
credit cards and smartcards, where space is at a premium.
