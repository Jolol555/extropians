My guess-since I read Drexler's book back in  86'  would be 
experimentationalist in nature. Libertarian yes, but this would be the only 
political movement that was largely based on the advance in science and 
technology. The labor unions in British politics in the 19th century would be 
absolutely nothing by comparison.  Caveat: if scitech proves very slow on 
producing life-enhancing developments, then the children and grandchildren of 
the Extropians will move on.  This is guarnateed!  And those keenly 
interested in such achivements, will be looked upon as we look upon those who 
were very excited about spiritualism in the 19th century.  Its basically a 
Darwinian meme-produce or perish.  Or as one AI program was quoted as saying 
"you're a cow! Either give milk, or go home!"
