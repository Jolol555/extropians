John, I think, is talking specifically about terrestrial analog societies 
(which, granted, is easier than looking objectively at _all_ the 
possibilities).  The thing is, we don't really know.  The possibilities are 
staggering, and aren't restricted to "heavy element planets."  Creatures 
<a name="1187qlink1">composed of dark matter, for example, haven't even been mentioned.</a>

<p>
<a href="1138.html#1183qlink2">&gt;(2)  John states that it would be obvious to anyone with eyes that the night</a><br>

<p>
There is no reference other than speculation...at least, none that I'm aware 
of.  John thinks that advanced societies will more or less inevitably use 
their technologies to create giant artifacts out of stellar raw material, 
etc.  There have been attempts to locate giant cosmological artifacts, but so 
far no luck.  One theory is that the giant black hole at the center of our 
galaxy is some sort of industrial accident left by an alien civilization 
(which, by the way, would have been killed off...<a name="1187qlink2">one of the guiding notions 
of the nanotech-hypers is that once a nanotech civilization emerges, it's 
necessarily here to stay.  I think this is a particularly premature notion).</a>

<p>
<a name="1206qlink1"><a name="1187qlink3">...In fact, I'd be willing to argue that _some_ of this mantric insistence on 
imperishable, galaxy-spanning supercivilizations is representative of a kind 
of postindustrial God-wish.</a>  It has the earmarks of an embryonic religion, 
</a>
composed of absolutes ("galaxy is engineered" vs. "there are no aliens").  
This climate is very good at fostering allegiance.  I've yet to see any 
evidence that it can encompass objectivity, as well.
