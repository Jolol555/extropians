By the way, as many of you know, I make my living by being a paid hacker for
a very large company.  I work at home half the time, and travel to client
sites around the country half the time.  If anybody has the skills and
desire to do likewise, I would very much like you to e-mail me offline.

<p>
I have run my own consulting business for years, but I am currently making
more money working for the big organizations than I could do on my own.
They give me more referrals than I can possibly handle.  This organization
needs to fill an additional 30 such positions in the next six months.

<p>
I'm afraid that the "training" provided by this organization is a joke.  If
you do not have the technical ability already, this organization will not
provide it.  Their training will teach you how to do customer engagements
their way, but will not give you the technical skills to do the job.
