<a name="3915qlink1">Hello everyone,

<p>
I listened to an Art Bell show several months ago where Dr. Moller spoke 
about his skycar.  He answered to my total satisfaction every question put 
to him regarding his craft.  Whether the concerns were about the computer 
that flew it, aerodynamics, air safety, cost or insurance rates he seemed to 
have everything in hand.

<p>
I wonder what list members think of his skycar?  Is it really everything he 
makes it out to be?  He even admits that the one million dollar price tag 
would only go down if it could be mass-produced.  But then in a decade or 
less the price would be in the realm of a mid-priced automobile!

<p>
I'm hoping to be jetting around in my own moller skycar in about fifteen 
years time!  I hope it is not too good to be true.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
