Abstract
<br>
  This study compared heterocyclic aromatic amines in marinated and unmarinated
  chicken breast meat flame-broiled on a propane grill. Chicken was marinated
  prior to grilling and the levels of several heterocyclic amines formed during
  cooking were determined by solid-phase extraction and HPLC. Compared with
  unmarinated controls, a 92-99% decrease in
  2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) was observed in whole
  chicken breast marinated with a mixture of brown sugar, olive oil, cider
  vinegar, garlic, mustard, lemon juice and salt, then grilled for 10, 20, 30
  or 40 min. Conversely, 2-amino-3, 8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx)
  increased over 10-fold with marinating, but only at the 30
  and 40 min cooking times. Marinating reduced the total
  detectable heterocyclic amines from 56 to 1.7 ng/g, from 158 to 10 ng/g and
  from 330 to 44 ng/g for grilling times of 20, 30 and 40 min, respectively.
  The mutagenic activity of the sample extracts was also measured, using the
  Ames/Salmonella assay. Mutagenic activity was lower in marinated samples
  cooked for 10, 20 and 30 min, but higher in the marinated samples cooked for
  40 min, compared with unmarinated controls. Although a change in free amino
  acids, which are heterocyclic amine precursors, might explain the decrease in
  PhIP and increase in MeIQx, no such change was detected.
  Marinating chicken in one ingredient at a time showed that
  sugar was involved in the increased MeIQx, but the reason for the decrease in
  PhIP was unclear. PhIP decreased in grilled chicken after
  marinating with several individual ingredients. This work
  shows that marinating is one method that can significantly
  reduce PhIP concentration in grilled chicken.
