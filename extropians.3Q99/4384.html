<a name="4392qlink1">That is valuing computation as an intermediate good, not as an end good.
It is very different from claiming that aliens value only computation.
One can easily value other things and yet choose to let technology grow.
That's what we all do now.  I could more easily argue that natural
selection will favor civilizations that try to expand spatially.</a>

<a name="4392qlink2"><a href="4373.html#4384qlink3">&gt; &gt; And I'm sure we could ifeden.computational problems that are so</a><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; to compute with.  How can you know that advanced creatures aren't</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interested in such problems?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Yes, but there is probably only a small set of computational</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems where the data can be separated into logical subdivisions</i><br>
<i>&gt; that do not require significant communication of inputs and outputs.</i><br>
<i>&gt; ... You win much more by figuring out the optimal computer architecture</i><br>
<i>&gt; and building it locally, than you do by colonizing the nearest stars.</i><br>

<p>
I'm not going to take your word on this.  I want to see some analysis
before I'll be persuaded.
