<p>
I'm lucky enough to be one of the first people to see the new second
edition of Natasha Vita-More's Create/Recreate: The 3rd Millennial Culture.
Although I've seen much of it as Natasha developed it, I was blown away
with the final printed book.

<p>
The second edition expands greatly on the first, combining a wide range of
information about the arts and sciences of transhumanism with a crisp,
stylish layout.

<p>
Create/Recreate would make a wonderful gift for anyone you'd like to get
interested in transhumanism, especially if they are not moved by purely
technical discussions.

<p>
Even if you have the first edition, I highly recommend upgrading to this
new, augmented edition. The book is replete with essays and art,
simultaneously stimulating, informing, and fun, including
<br>
"Post-Jeans-Post-Genes Generation", "A Brief Transhuman Timeline",<br>
"Arterati On Ideas", and the "Memetic Toolkit".<br>

<p>
Okay, okay, so I'm not an objective reviewer (though I'm tougher on
Natasha's work than anyone, as any constructive partner will be), but I
really do strongly recommend Create/Recreate. I hope that Natasha will put
an ad for her delightful new book on her web site. In the meantime, you can
contact her at &lt;natasha@natasha.cc&gt;

<p>
Onward!
