On a related topic -- I just received a copy of a new newsletter from "The
Anti-Transhumanist League", which arrived in an envelope with no return
address (but has a Portland, OR postal mark). After a comment on the
<br>
"transhumanist cult" based on a quote about the concept of soul from Nick<br>
Bostrom, the newsletter largely attacks transhumanism by quoting from my
1990 essay "Transhumanism: Towards a Futurist Philosophy".

<p>
The writer is almost certainly a fundamentalist Christian. I don't take his
or her claims about their international organization against transhumanism
seriously, but it's interesting to finally see some stirring of
anti-transhumanism from those intellectually debilitated by an excess of
religion. For your entertainment, here's a sample selection:

<p>
<a name="2991qlink1">"Max More makes it very clear in his essay diatribe against religion that<br>
religion is the force arrayed against the goals of transhumanists and must
</a>
be eradicated if their Godless posthuman super race has any chance of
coming into existence."

<p>
"Dear readers, this guy is not kidding. He means to eradicate religion, all<br>
religions, as he knows that as long as religion is a force in people [sic]
lives Transhumanist eugenics - disguised as progress - will be fought tooth
and claw by the religious."

<p>
<a name="2991qlink2">Does anyone have any information about this person(s). Since they sound
rather adamant and upset,<a name="2998qlink1"> I'd like to keep an eye on them.</a></a>

<p>
Thanks,

<p>
Max
