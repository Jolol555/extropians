Seems feasible.  We have the technology now (in a very primitive
form) to connect electronics to neurons.  So long as you have
a spinal cord, optic nerves, auditory nerves, etc. you should
be able to get full sensory input into a computer and have full
output control.  I'm unsure whether there are parts of the sensory
I/O pathways that fail to develop normally in anencephalics.

<a name="2161qlink1">Of course the question begs another -- if you had a remote controlled
anencephalic child, what would you do</a> with it?

As a side comment, one of the things that I like about this group
is the fact that are some very "creative", perhaps even "sick"
individuals who follow it and come up with ideas that never would
have occured to me... many :-).
