<a href="0475.html#0577qlink1">&gt; growth (in fact we were barely surviving as a species) *until* we</a><br>
<i>&gt; developed the technologies that allowed us to manipulate the</i><br>
<i>&gt; environment in ways more sophisticated than our genetic program allowed.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If our genetic program doesn't allow it, we can't do it. This is not
negotiable if you accept Darwin's theory of Natural Selection. Discuss this?

<p>
<a href="0475.html#0577qlink2">&gt; (the majority would seem to be those species that take as much as</a><br>
<i>&gt; they can and hold it the longest).   </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
On this planet, yes, but we can't say at all how much that translates
elsewhere - don't forget we have NO external data.

<p>
<a href="0475.html#0577qlink3">&gt; If evolving to the limit of physics *is* feasible, and "life"</a><br>
<i>&gt; is designed to "evolve", can you make a case for the cessation</i><br>
<i>&gt; of evolution?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<p>
	There is the local minima problem, in which it is conceivable that
species could become stuck, do you think?

<p>
	Rob.
