<a name="1010qlink1">Paul Hughes, I strongly suspect that you and Crocker are using entirely
different definitions of the word "belief".  You're defining it as an
assertion that is believed with 100% probability and is probably
emotionally supported.  Crocker is defining it as a probabilistic
assertion, which probability is *not* necessarily 50% or greater, but
which *is* more likely (to within, say, an order of magnitude) than any
alternate assertions.</a>

<p>
That's why I said that neither Crocker nor I "believed" in anything, and
why Crocker said that refusing to believe in anything is a form of moral
cowardice.  I meant that certainties are unnecessary, and Crocker meant
that claiming to refuse all judgement (as to which of two assertions is
<br>
*more* plausible) is being afraid to say anything because you might be<br>
proved wrong.  (It's also dishonest; you can't avoid such judgements and
remain functional.)

<p>
<a name="1010qlink2">Do you believe that you can't believe in anything?  This strikes me as
being inconsistent.</a>
