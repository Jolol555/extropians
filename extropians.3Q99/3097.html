In yesterday's Washington Post Outlook Section (still easily available on
their web archives), is an essay written by Brad Williamson, one of the
members of the task force that proposed a set of guideline to the Kansas
school board (title: 'I Teach, Therefore I Worry, in Kansas').  He teaches
high school biology, and some of his thoughts reflect Max's comments.

<p>
Also, included with the essay is the set of guidelines originally proposed,
based on National Science Education Standards, which state, in part:
'Understand does not mandate 'belief'.  While students may be required to
understand some concepts that researchers use to conduct research and solve
practical problems, they may accept or reject the scientific concepts
presented.  This applies particularly where students' and/or parents'
religion is at odds with science.'  (this language was rejected in favor of
the present guidelines.)
