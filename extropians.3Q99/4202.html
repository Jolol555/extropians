I think one reason that has allowed places like the Price Club to sell stuff
cheaply, is the fact that they are a membership store.  They don't let people
in, unless they know that they have a good job.  And this not only keeps out
most of the people who are likely to shoplift, it also keeps out people who
don't have much purchasing power.
