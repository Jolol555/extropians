It contains the updraft and allows it to more efficiently transport heat to
the top of the troposphere.  The upper surface of the resultant cloud (it
doesn't work as well without condensation) then radiates to space (as well
as reducing the insolation on the area around the tower).  Rain would fall
downwind as well as inside the tower.

<p>
Yes, but as moisture condenses, the air cools much more slowly (wet
adiabatic vs dry adiabatic), and because it is much warmer than the air
outside the tower, it is less dense, powering the updraft.  The updraft is
relatively warm, moving heat from the surface into space.

<p>

<i>&gt; had some other principle in mind.</i><br>

<p>
By reducing mixing (thermals separate from their warm source on the surface
and become vortex rings which ingest cool air from their surroundings) the
tower encourages a much greater mass (and heat) flow than would naturally
occur.  It's merely a damn big chimney- and large chimneys can "draw" on a
sunny day even when the brickwork is *cooler* than the inlet air.  Poor
heat transfer makes the flow nearly adiabatic despite the presence of the
cold walls.  I once saw a large abandoned chimney (a large door open in its
base) drawing strongly on a warm day- no wind, cold bricks.
