Well put, David.

<a href="4948.html#4959qlink2">&gt;I wonder how many of the comments that Kathryn says drove women away </a><br>

<p>
<a name="4972qlink1">One way to tell--how angry the person gets once offense is mentioned.
Persons who do not mean to give offense generally want to know how offense
was taken and would usually want to try not to do so again.</a>  Within reason,
of course.  Sometimes offense is taken no matter what you do, but I think
that most women that would be attracted to a list like this have some
amount of experience in the world.
