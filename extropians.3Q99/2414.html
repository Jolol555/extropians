The Mathematics of Quantum Computation
<br>
February 7-11, 2000

<p>
Organizing Committee:  Michael Freedman (Microsoft Research) Bernd
Sturmfels (UCB Mathematics) Umesh Vazirani (UCB Computer Science)

<p>
      In the past years, quantum computation has emerged as the
<br>
"presumptive model" among proposals of new paradigms for computing.<br>
Quantum computing seems to provide a model for the computational
capacity of any physically plausible finite dimensional quantum
mechanical system including the modular functors of topological
field theories. Quantum computing is still a very young field, and
our understanding of its power compared to other models of
computational complexity is still very preliminary -- the most
notable success being Shor?s factoring algorithm.

<p>
      This goal of this workshop is to focus on the more mathematical
aspects of quantum computation, and to bring the central challenges
of quantum computation to the attention of mathematicians.  The
workshop will discuss many mathematical and physical topics impinging
on quantum computing and quantum information theory -- ranging from
topology to representation theory to statistical physics.

<p>
      The workshop will be organized around a sequence of expository
talks by experts in the area. A preliminary list of speakers is
given below:

<pre>
	       Issac Chuang (IBM Almaden)
               Michael Freedman (Microsoft Research) 
               Richard Jozsa (Plymouth University, England) 
               Peter Shor (Bell Laboratories) 
               Umesh Vazirani (U.C. Berkeley) 
               Andrew Yao (Princeton University) 
               Nolan Wallach (U.C. San Diego) 

</pre>
<p>
We will also organize a series of contributed talks on recent
progress in all aspects of quantum algorithms, quantum complexity
theory and quantum information theory.

they put it on the web ....
