<p>
This is not supported by medical fact.  When someone becomes paralyzed, the
clock begins ticking immediately.  Complete immobility begins a rapid
degeneration in muscles, tendons, and connective tissues.  The athletic
qualities of his body only shield him slightly from that.  

<p>
Reeve's bestselling book details the onerous procedures he must undergo
every day in order to preserve his musculature.  Without these procedures,
he would have only a year before the deterioration would be too advanced
for him to be able to walk again.  With these procedures, there is still no
guarantee after a few years have lapsed.
