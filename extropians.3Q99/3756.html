You can't be serious. Rightly or wrongly many people, myself included,
</a>
are certain that the universe can not supply us with meaning, and yet
that idea does not drive us insane, I haven't murdered anyone in months.

<p>
<a name="3768qlink2">If something has no meaning and you don't like that then don't go into
a coma, change the situation and give it a meaning. You can give
a meaning to a huge cloud of hydrogen gas a billion light years away
but it can't give meaning to you because meaning is generated by mind.
Personally I like this situation because I might not like the meaning
that the universe assigns to me, I'd much rather be the boss and
assign a meaning to the universe.</a>

<p>
Even if you don't like my philosophy it keeps me going and you
must admit it beats "quiescence". The beauty of it is that I can
never be proven wrong because it's based on a personal preference,
not the way the universe works. You can never prove that I really
do like sweet potatoes either because I don't, It's just the way my
brain is wired.

<p>
<a name="3768qlink3">You might argue that even though I can't be proven wrong I still
might be wrong, well maybe.</a> But if being right means death or
<a name="3768qlink4">insanity and being wrong means operating in a efficient and happy
manner  then whatever could you mean by right and wrong?</a> I'd
<a name="3768qlink5">say a happy efficient brain is constructed correctly and a insane or
quiescent brain is constructed incorrectly, but again that's just my
opinion, I like things</a> that work
