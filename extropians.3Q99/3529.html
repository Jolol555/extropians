I think it is safe to say that New Zealand is more free
now than it was twenty years ago and perhaps that it is
now one of the more free countries in the world.  However,
there's absolutely no risk in saying that it has a very
long way to go, even from a fairly weak libertarian
perspective.

<p>
I've read a few articles on the New Zealand "revolution" 
from a libertarian perspective:

</pre>
<p>
All I really recall about the content of these articles is
that the first two express excitement about how much progress
has been made, while the third complains that not much progress
has really been made, and that the real problem is that New
Zealanders haven't been sold on libertarian philosophy.
