<p>
Emlyn, regarding your thesis, you might consider studying a phenomenon
that Greg Stock spoke about at E4, the effect of cash prizes on research,
such as distributed computing.  His thesis, if I understood it correctly, is
that when a prize is offered for a feat, several times the amount of the
prize is spent by all the participants collectively in the attempt to claim
the prize.  How many jillions are spent trying to win a Nobel prize of a
few hundred K?  For this reason, cash prizes act as a technological
force multiplier.

<p>
For your computer science thesis, consider distributed computing.
The reason this is so study-able is that some distributed projects
such as GIMPS have available the amount of computer time being
produced as a function of time.  see

<p>
<a href="http://entropia.com/ips/stats.html">http://entropia.com/ips/stats.html</a>

<p>
You can see computing accomplished as a function of date and
results reported as a function of time of day, etc.

<p>
Heres where your research could go:


<OL>
  <li>  Get in touch with Scott Kurowski, the organizer of GIMPS,
see if he will give you the raw data that is shown in graphical
form on the site above.

  <li>  With that data, do a butterworth filter or similar digital
filtering technique [fourier transform to frequency domain,
filter out the yearly component, then inverse transform back
into time domain, etc].

  <li>  Use that data to determine how the introduction of the
cash prize, announced on 1 April 1999, effected the number
of participants.  Determine if the claim of the first EFF prize
on 1 June 1999 caused the masses to lose interest and
give up, or did the publicity cause more to sign on, etc.

  <li>  Determine if the *way* in which the EFF prize was
structured actually contribute to the overall effort, or did it in
fact, *detract from* the effort by encouraging participants
to leave the organized search and go off treasure hunting alone.
This lone wolf behavior creates a situation where the same
exponents may be checked by several people instead of
just two, decreasing efficiency of an organized distributed
computing effort.

  <li>  See if you can figure out a good project for distributed
computing that uses idle CPU cycles.  We have a lot of idle
computers on our list and a lot of open minds.  spike
