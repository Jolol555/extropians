In general, the more detached you are from something, the more
you can look at it from many angles which give you greater
power, or perhaps a better word would be seniority, over it.
Pity would generally be an emotional reaction created perhaps
as a defense mechanism for validating ones position.  "That
poor fool, he just doesn't see that I'm right."  Presumably
these emotional responses were used to justify risk-taking
behaviors that were disapproved of by the rest of the tribe
but which did offer some chance of success.

<a name="3379qlink1">Indifference is difficult to achieve I would agree.  The
two best techniques that I know about are "self-observational"
meditation and the "Stop" technique developed (or at least
used) by the Russian(?) mystic Gurdieff.  I'm not sure
the stop technique (where a teacher requests that the student
"stop" and notice the thoughts passing through the mind)
can work on oneself.<a name="3465qlink1">  It would seem to require an isolated
part of the mind that can produce random interrupts.
