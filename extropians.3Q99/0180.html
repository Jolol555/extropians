        This discussion has taken place on this list numerous times in the
past, most recently in mid-December, and before that in early August.  You

<a name="0198qlink2">        The general consensus at that time was that there is a dichotomy
between subjectivity and objectivity: music that extropians like and music
written by extropians.  As a musician myself, I will submit that my own
compositions would not be collectively liked by all extropians;</a>
additionally, the amount of styles in which I write (mostly instrumental)
would make it hard for any one person to like all of my music.  However, I
<a name="0198qlink3">am an extropian, and therefore, in a sense I write "extropian" music.</a>  On
the other side of the coin, music listening is extremely subjective...one
might as well discuss the uniformity of "extropian" taste in clothing.
