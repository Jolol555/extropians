<a href="0591.html#0595qlink1">&gt; This brings to mind one of Clarke's laws, where he said something along the</a><br>

<p>
It seems to me that people tend to overestimate the short-term
(meaning 5-10 years) improvements in the currently-hot technologies,
while longer-term (20-30 years), improvements often sneak up on them in
other areas that they aren't thinking about.

<p>
Back in the 60s, what was hot?  Plastics?  Space exploration?  Big
mainframes?

<p>
In the early 80s, what was hot?  Biotech?  AI and expert systems?
Consumer Reports published a book in 1983 or so that described home
computers as a failed technology.

<p>
In 1990, what was hot?  Virtual reality?  Compuserve and Prodigy?
