Hey Emlyn,

But what about the hyper-ultra-super-superior-intelligences (HUSSIs)?
It just so happens I dated a hussi for about six months last year!  "It" was 
extremely intelligent to the point of manipulating me in any way she wanted 
to while I was blissfully happy to be exploited!  I spent a great deal of 
money and time on her to only find out from a mutual friend that this hussi 
was engaging in potentially reproductive behavior with another guy(and not 
me!).  Despite the ultra super, super social intelligence of the hussi this 
broke the spell it had over me as my genetic hardwiring cried out in rage!  
We broke up.  Now if I can only learn how to tell the difference between 
real female human beings and the clever hussi imposters.

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
