<i>&gt; &gt; Hello everyone,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I was just kidding on the idea of Mike and Joe duelling at ten paces! In</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; relation to the gun control debate between Mike Lorrey and Joe Dees I just</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; want to say both men have the right to discuss the matter but it does seem</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to have been beaten to death here on the list.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I realize both men feel they MUST counter any arguments brought forth by the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; other no matter how many times it has been discussed before.  I think this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; is not so much for them but for any impressionable minds out there that are</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; not set yet in one way of looking at things at least in some matters(like</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; me).</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I wish we could have a formal debate between them moderated on this very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; list by Greg Burch our legal eagle.  Each man would have his turn and then a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chance for rebuttal would be given.  It would go on for so many times and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; then Mr. Burch would ask for closing statements.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I would be happy to be involved in such a debate, but I personally would</i><br>
<i>&gt; like to debate with someone who can actually bring information to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; debate, not curses and personal attacks.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
And the reference to the Francis Fukuyama article was not 
informative for you?
<br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<a href="5066.html#5109qlink2">&gt; &gt; Even if this did not end the debate we would have at least held a "formal"</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; debate of the matter.  Kept relatively short I would read each post with</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; interest.  I hope my idea is actually done.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I consider banning the topic of gun control to be wrong along with banning</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; any topic on the list.  I think it goes against extropian ideals.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; But at the same time I can remember countless times scrolling over numerous</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; long posts when you two debated in a desire to find topics that appealled to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; me more.  I feel like Captain Kirk on the bridge when the two powerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; aliens with black and white coloring on differing sides got into a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; never-ending power struggle.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I personally believe in the right of common citizens to bear arms when they</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have gotten a concealment permit.  There are those who would say the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; information the government gets on a citizen is too much when the permit is</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; obtained but I am more worried about people packing heat who do not FULLY</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; understand the legal and real life ramifications of this.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; It is quite possible to have a system that both ensures that a person is</i><br>
<i>&gt; a law abiding citizen, and prevents the government from being able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; use this information to compile an ad hoc enemies list. It is currently</i><br>
<i>&gt; in existence, it is called NICS, the National Instant Check System. The</i><br>
<i>&gt; way it works (as specified under the Brady Bill) is that a person's</i><br>
<i>&gt; name, SSN, etc are entered into the system, which replies with a go</i><br>
<i>&gt; ahead, hold, or denied response. A Go Ahead response is supposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt; immediately flush the evidence of the query on that individuals ID</i><br>
<i>&gt; information, so there is not a longer term record that a specific law</i><br>
<i>&gt; abiding individual bought a gun. Hold responses occur when there is iffy</i><br>
<i>&gt; information, like a record of a temporary restraining order, on the</i><br>
<i>&gt; database, that needs to be checked on to see if it is still in force.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Denied responses are flagged and the ID information goes into a federal</i><br>
<i>&gt; felony violation database.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This system, which the Clinton's and the gun controllers fought tooth</i><br>
<i>&gt; and nail against, was only added to the Brady Bill at the instistence of</i><br>
<i>&gt; one party, the NRA. When the 5-day waitng period and the unfunded</i><br>
<i>&gt; mandate on local  law enforcement to perform background checks were</i><br>
<i>&gt; tossed out by the Supreme Court, the administration belatedly</i><br>
<i>&gt; institutded the NICS system, that they had originally promised would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; in place within one year of the Brady Bill passage. However they</i><br>
<i>&gt; instituted one illegal change in the system, the FBI keeps records of</i><br>
<i>&gt; ALL individuals who are queried on in the database for 6 to 18 months.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The FBI ostensibly claims that this is for 'auditing' purposes, but they</i><br>
<i>&gt; have done only one audit, at the insistence of the Republican congress,</i><br>
<i>&gt; they have illegally disseminated information about law abiding</i><br>
<i>&gt; individuals to local law enforcement from the system, and they have only</i><br>
<i>&gt; prosecuted ONE of the alleged tens of thousands of 'criminals' that were</i><br>
<i>&gt; denied by the system, which is a gross case of capricious enforcement.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I realize there are those who interpret the right to bear arms as very</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; different and think only police and soldiers should be issued guns.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; vehemently oppose this view.  I honestly believe in the saying that "if you</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; take away all the guns in the end only criminals will have guns!"</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; What they think is irrelevant. When Prof. Lawrence Tribe, arguably the</i><br>
<i>&gt; most liberal recognised constitutional law professor in the country,</i><br>
<i>&gt; agrees that the Cummins decision in the case US v. Emerson correctly</i><br>
<i>&gt; interprets the Constitution that the right to keep and bear arms is an</i><br>
<i>&gt; individual right, and that it should not be infringed at all, then only</i><br>
<i>&gt; a pure Stalinist could continue to insist on any other interpretation.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; At the same time I find the idea of an America where everyone has a</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; concealed handgun to be a very sad and frightening place.  But I feel the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; option of being armed should be available to the public.  Were I beaten and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mugged I would definitely get a concealed weapons permit and a pistol to go</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; with it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I personally place more trust in myself, and my fellow citizens, than in</i><br>
<i>&gt; local, state, or federal police. Those citizens I am wrong in trusting</i><br>
<i>&gt; will find out the error of their ways if they wish to test things.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Considering that any given police officer is five times more likely to</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill an innocent person at a crime scene than any given armed law</i><br>
<i>&gt; abiding private citizen at a crime scene, it just a matter of public</i><br>
<i>&gt; health to ban the police and arm the people. ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; The NRA lost my support when they opposed mandatory trigger locks on all</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; guns.  I realize this law would slow down access to a weapon in a home</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; robbery situation but how many children must die to please the NRA??</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Perhaps mandatory cases with electronic locks would work best though it</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; would be expensive by comparison.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The NRA has always been the greatest proponent of gun safety. Indeed the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first nationally used fire arms safety courses insituted outside the</i><br>
<i>&gt; military were established by the NRA. The state of New York asked the</i><br>
<i>&gt; NRA to formulate a standard safety course which was required of all gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; permit applicants there. Massachusetts used to use the same course,</i><br>
<i>&gt; until this year when they decided to copy the NRA course, and charge</i><br>
<i>&gt; $200.00 to applicants to take the course, administered by state</i><br>
<i>&gt; employees (union members, paid nice salaries w/ benefits rather than the</i><br>
<i>&gt; usual free or almost free NRA volunteer), in addition to the permit fees</i><br>
<i>&gt; and taxes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Trigger locks are indeed a hindrance to the safety of life and limb for</i><br>
<i>&gt; any weapon to be used for self defense purposes. Keep in mind that prior</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the industry agreement to include trigger locks (there as yet is no</i><br>
<i>&gt; national trigger lock law), the rate of death and injury from accidental</i><br>
<i>&gt; firearms discharges (in any age group) was at the lowest level of any</i><br>
<i>&gt; time since such stats were first taken, in 1903. (National Safety Board</i><br>
<i>&gt; stats). Since I don't have any kids, I don't keep my defense gun locked</i><br>
<i>&gt; up, as I carry it most everywhere, but my other guns are locked in their</i><br>
<i>&gt; cases, and I am awaiting the arrival of a much more secure safe, since</i><br>
<i>&gt; my collection is growing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I am concerned bout my guns falling into the wrong hands, as is any gun</i><br>
<i>&gt; owner, but I am more concerned about my life falling into the wrong</i><br>
<i>&gt; hands. The stats say I have the proper priorities...</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Here in Alaska we view ourselves as living in the "last frontier" and I</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; suppose compared to other states have fairly open views on gun control.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; also we are a republican state rather then democratic.  Actually I think</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; human predators are much more threatening here then the ones with claws and</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; antlers.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; Well, here I am contributing to the volume of gun control debate posts!  But</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; I admit it is a very important topic with in my view no easy answers.  And</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; it ties in at a core level I think with how government desires to hoarde</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; power for itself.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Considering that government repression kills more people around the</i><br>
<i>&gt; world every year than any other non-natural factor, by large magnitudes,</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree with you. Considering that twenty to fifty times more people</i><br>
<i>&gt; have been killed in the industrialized world alone this century by</i><br>
<i>&gt; repressive governments on unarmed popultions than have been killed by</i><br>
<i>&gt; violent crime between individuals, I say you are right on the money.</i><br>
