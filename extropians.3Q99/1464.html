<p>
Yes, in a more fluid economy, with massive and almost free computational
architectures, this would represent few problems. The only bureaucracy would
be the execution of simple algorithms.
<br>
Probably cryptography would make this process safe. Of course I was
interested in the fact that this would use the human being appetite for
money and love of game (really addictive ;) to augment the quantity of
economical transactions and then the working of the global society.

<p>
<i>&gt;However, in a free</i><br>
<a href="1457.html#1464qlink5">&gt;world there would be a free market in lotteries, which would have exactly</a><br>
the
<br>
<a href="1457.html#1464qlink6">&gt;same effect without forcing anyone to participate.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
Yes, point well taken, I should choose my words better here.

<p>
In a free world, I was wondering if such kind of systems, *if really
efficient*, would not be massively adopted by people who are interested by
charity but do want also to give themselve a good chance to survive in
correct conditions if something goes wrong. Your wealth becoming linked to
the wealth of the people playing this game. Example : if your buziness is
not friendly to human being, you don't give to charity or are not willing to
give me a good chance to survive in the future, then I will probably not buy
your product because it has not this essential feature for me... free of
"taxes" buziness would then become after a little time the domain of AI or a
few minority of human beings ??

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; P.S</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1457.html#1464qlink7">&gt;&gt; an interesting and fun side effect would be to select the Darwin way a</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; more lucky society, for sure we really need it for the future ;)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="1537qlink1"><i>&gt;There's no evidence for "luck" as an attribute of individuals, and I don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;see any plausible way to posit a mechanism for it. Sounds a lot like "Psi."</i><br>
<i>&gt;If either were proved to exist, that would be a huge scientific revolution,</i><br>
<i>&gt;completely aside from possibilities of natural or sexual selection being</i><br>
used
<br>
<a href="1457.html#1464qlink8">&gt;to enhance any such abilities.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
of course ;) I was just kidding, I've read Ringworld some little time ago,
and one of the person in the book is choosen for a quest just because of her
extreme luck.
