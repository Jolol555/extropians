"It depends on what your definition of 'is' is."  I might also add "The Universe
is as the Universe does", however, I do agree with you for the most part, and
should have been a bit more careful with the "is" part.  For most scientists, the
end product is the model.  The more that can be predicted by the model, the more
they feel that they have accomplished.  And I think the best do have a desire to
know what the Universe "is" but this cannot be complete.

<a name="4594qlink1">Your comment about being inside Matrix-like chambers is very close to what is
going on in your own head.  The part of your brain that thinks about</a> the outside
<a name="4594qlink2">world does not get the direct sense data, but is given a composite VR by the
autonomic parts of the rest of your brain.  You can do little</a> visual experiments
<a name="4594qlink3">on yourself to see the flaws in the simulation, and researchers learn more by
study of those who have major defects in parts of the system.
