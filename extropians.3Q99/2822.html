You do Mike, you do.

[First read my previous post on "Understanding nanotech".]

<p>
Then being the spacey kind of guy that you are, you figure out
how much power you need to push your mansion into orbit on
top of a *big* laser.  (NASA is doing experiments with these
now and they do work, though the lasers and the satellites
are still small).  Then you construct said laser *under*
your mansion.  Then you make an even bigger pool of molten
salt to store a lot of heat energy.  Alternatively and perhaps
more efficiently, you could slowly convert the material
under your mansion into saphireoid flywheels.  Superconducting
rings are another possibility if you are in that part of Arizona
where the ground has a high copper content.

<p>
Then you wait until you have accumulated enough energy from your
personal power grid (or have borrowed enough from the power
bank because you promise to pay it back from the solar power
satellites you are going to build once you get to space).
Den you press de beeg red button on your home entertainment
(aka mansion navigation control panel) and enjoy de ride.

<p>
And you better make darn sure that your open source "fly-your-
mansion-to-the-moon" gang has either debugged all of the software
and hardware or you have a big insurance policy because if your
mansion goes off course and crashes onto my yacht in my pool,
I'm going to get Obie Wan Burch to sue the pants off of you.

<p>
Stop looking for handouts and get cracking on those designs.
