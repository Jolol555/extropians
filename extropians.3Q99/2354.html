<a name="2366qlink1">The most plausible alternative, imho, would be to assume that the
wavefunction is not 'real'</a> and is a product of limited knowledge.  This,
btw, is the Copenhagen interpretation, not many people actually believe in
observer collapse.  My own interpretation would be that although the
wavefunction is a product of limited knowledge it is no less real than
anything else.  All physical theories are shaped by our limited knowledge.

Btw, Bryce DeWitt has a interesting review of _The Fabric of Reality_ at the
following URL:

states the universe is one big ol' cellular automata, it's the
somebody-somebody conjecture (not Church-Turing).
