A few years ago I read about a pregnant woman who was deaf for
hereditary reasons.  She wanted to find out, by amniocentesis, whether
the fetus carried the gene, so that she could abort it if it was _not_
deaf.

<a name="3893qlink1">H. G. Wells wrote a story called "The Country of the Blind", in which
a traveler happened on an isolated valley that was inhabited entirely
by blind people.  He settled among them, but eventually they
discovered that he was suffering from delusions that, on
investigation, turned out to be connected with his eyes.  That
discovery allowed them to effect a cure.</a>
