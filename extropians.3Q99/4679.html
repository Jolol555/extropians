&lt;&lt; If those Sprite ads had aired ten years ago, the audience might not have
 understood what they were seeing.  But today's audiences are more culturally
 literate - the kids in Iowa who watch MTV probably have at least a glancing
 familiarity with Anime, Jackie Chan and Tupac Shakur that makes the
 synthesis more comprehensible to them.

I liked this post.
<br>
Anime in general has many mixed technology-organic themes, which is one of 
the reasons why I love it so much. Thinking about it now: so does hip-hop 
(though much of it involved mixing human voice with prerecorded organic 
sound). Mixing genres, is of course, nothing new to pop culture. 

<p>
One of the reasons why I didn't have much to say regarding those posts about 
"NY gallery scenes" -- was I am in no way interested in "hi-brow" ( at least 
in the visual art scene). I watch pop culture much more closely.

<p>
As I researched architecture for a future cities I found not much else except 
Syd Mead and anime. And comix. And the occasional SF book cover. Oh yeah- and 
the Fifth Element book ( fremnch edition). 

<p>
I was forced to go to material that dealt with industrial design and organic 
architecture, two fields which utilize the latest materials in creating their 
art forms.

<a name="4696qlink1">As materials become less rigid, designs are becoming more and more *organic*
i.e.: curved  &amp; colorful - as opposed to boxy, black, darth vader like 
squares of the retro-future.

might look like after nan - let me know)
