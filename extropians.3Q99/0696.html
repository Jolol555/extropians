<a href="0614.html#0696qlink1">&gt; &gt; We don't know the laws of physics. We know what we know. We have</a><br>
<i>&gt; inferred</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; rules from experimental data which is often unverifiable. We hope that</i><br>
<i>&gt; our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; ideas are close (many are, but many still need to be tried and tested by</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; implementing technologies using such science - this is particularly true</i><br>
<i>&gt; of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; astrophysics - it's all theory.) but they are almost definitely not spot</i><br>
<i>&gt; on.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; But they are not wildly different from the truth, </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
So, you have the truth by which to make this distance comparison ? NO!
Aaaaaggh!  Am I the only one here able to rationalise with massive logical
errors?

<p>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<a href="0614.html#0696qlink2">&gt; &gt; Secondly, and more importantly (this is central to my argument) you</a><br>
<i>&gt; cannot</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; say from what persepective an alien intelligence might view the</i><br>
<i>&gt; universe. We</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; look up at night and see absence of photons, speckled with photon</i><br>
<i>&gt; sources,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; because we detect photons. But what about things we don't detect, things</i><br>
<i>&gt; we</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; have not yet discovered, or have misunderstood. These things will</i><br>
<i>&gt; represent</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the differences between civilisations. For all you know the universe</i><br>
<i>&gt; could</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; be saturated with "slorgopo energy" which many creatures detect for some</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; purpose or another, but we don't, it has no observable effect upon our</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; systems and so we haven't noticed it, and evolution hasn't utilised it.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; if the solar system were saturated with 'slorgopo energy' it would be</i><br>
<i>&gt; reproducable in any particle accelerator on any planet in the universe,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and its effects would be observable via astronomy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
No, no, no and more no's......I'm not quibbling with facts on any of this
stuff - I don't know all about science and math, I'm pointing out logical
fallacies in the statements you're making. You assume yet again - this time
that slorgopo energy is detectable by the tools of astronomy - well, I made
it up, and I say it ain't. Hundreds of years ago if I had proposed
electomagnetic radiation, undetectable by human senses, I'd have done an
afternoon on the barbeque. "Human senses see all, as God has blessed....blah
blah..." they'd rant as I go up in flames. Just as you are assuming that
astronomy tools see all. I think not.

<p>
<i>&gt;  Photons are among the most abundant, and are the easiest to detect by any</i><br>
<i>&gt; means using matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;From OUR perspective, from OUR technological standpoint.</i><br>
