I LIKE Israel! 
<br>
Here is a partial excerpt of the story:

<p>
"REHOVOT, Israel --The first general- purpose mechanical computer<br>
designed for biomolecular and pharmaceutical applications has been
developed by Prof. Ehud Shapiro of the Computer Science and Applied
Mathematics Department at the Weizmann Institute of Science. The
mechanical computer will be presented today at the Fifth International
Meeting on DNA-Based Computers at the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology. 
<br>
Shapiro's mechanical computer has been built to resemble the
biomolecular machines of the living cell, such as ribosomes.
Ultimately, this computer may serve as a model in constructing a
programmable computer of subcellular size, that may be able to operate
in the human body and interact with the body's biochemical
environment, thus having far-reaching biological and pharmaceutical
applications..."
