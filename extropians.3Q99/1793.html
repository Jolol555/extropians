<a href="1778.html#1793qlink1">&gt; Yes.  It's been a long time since I've done this</a><br>
<i>&gt; myself, so I practiced in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mirror today to see what results I could get.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt; have brown hair, and ended up</i><br>
<i>&gt; seeing a faint blue and yellow aura around my head. </i><br>
<i>&gt; Here is what you do. Face the</i><br>
<i>&gt; mirror with your back about 2 feet (60 cm) from the</i><br>
<i>&gt; wall.  Make sure the wall is</i><br>
<i>&gt; white.  The trick is to look at your head but focus</i><br>
<i>&gt; your eyes on the wall behind</i><br>
<i>&gt; you.  If you can maintain your focus behind you</i><br>
<i>&gt; while glancing at the outline of</i><br>
<i>&gt; your head and body, you should begin to notice the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'aura' effect.</i><br>

<p>
This sounds to me like the fairly standard way of
getting complimentary-coloured after images. For
instance, staring at a red pencil, then looking at
white paper, will produce a (fading) image of a blue
pencil (even with reversed-colour brand names, if
you're steady enough!).

<p>
The fringing you're seeing sounds to me like slight 
mis-registration between the original image of your
head and the after-image impressed on your retinas; 
you will see the same thing with the pencil on white
paper.

<p>
AFAIK, the idea is that the cone cells that are most
stimulated by the particular colour in an object,
become "exhausted" or accomodated.

<p>
When one then looks at white (all colours), the
previously stimulated cones do not respond much. This
lets the the cones for the other 2 colours (say green
and blue for a red object) fire preferentially,
leading to perception of the complimentary colour. 

<p>
<a href="1778.html#1793qlink2">&gt; Sometimes I can see vibrant aura's with lots of</a><br>
<i>&gt; colors extending up to a foot away</i><br>
<i>&gt; from a persons body, but other days barely anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; at all. </i><br>

<p>
That's interesting, can't think of why that happens.

<p>
<a name="1795qlink1"><a href="1778.html#1793qlink3">&gt; I have about the same</a><br>
<i>&gt; success as seeing those damn 3-d images that were so</i><br>
<i>&gt; popular a couple of years</i><br>
<i>&gt; back. :-)</i><br>

<p>
The first time I saw one of those, it took half an
hour of (too much!) effort to see it.  But my father,
who is long-sighted, saw his first 3D image within
seconds of looking at it! (without glasses as I
</a>recall).
