<a name="3360qlink1"><a name="3297qlink1">Does anyone know where I can find accounts of the very early history of
the Extropy Institute, Foresight Institute, or any similar
organizations?  Who founded it, the size of the initial group, how they
were incorporated, where the early funders were found (if any), what
tasks the Institutes performed, what type of volunteer work was
involved, how they found volunteers, at what point they were
incorporated as nonprofits, the text of their charters?</a>

<p>
I'm sure you can guess why I want to know, but please don't take this as
a promise or anything.  I just want to know what's involved - in
particular, what would have to be in place for the potential to exist.

<p>
If you have any general Web resources to suggest, I'll take those too.
