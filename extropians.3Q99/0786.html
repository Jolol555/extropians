Just thought I'd relay something I saw on TV...
(some kind of educational show, don't remember other
than that.)

<p>
<a name="0810qlink1">You have a laser, pointing at a wall. (little dot on
wall) Presumably, all the photons are going in the
same direction.<a name="0787qlink1"> You take two objects (I think maybe
razor blades) And start to block the beam with them,
one on each side. (forming a vertical slit, making the
dot smaller) when they get _really close together_
instead of a very slotted vertical dot, you get a
horizontal spread.</a> The explanation was that the fact
</a>
<a name="0810qlink2">that you 'knew the position' of the photons so
accurately (because of the very narrow slit) you
_could not_ know their velocity. (and hence direction)
I figured (I think correctly) that the spread was just
horizontal (it was still as tall as the diameter of
the laser beam) because you only 'knew' the horizontal
position accurately.</a>
<br>
<a name="0810qlink3">I don't know if it was real or not, or if the effect
was actually because of QM, but I decided I didn't
want to think about QM for a few months because I
might hurt something, or scare myself. (Photons should
NOT be that smart)</a>
