Neither India nor China can do squat about it, and India hates Muslims
anyways, and Russia wont do anything since Iraq is funding the Islamic
separatists in the southern Russian republics. If Iraq kills other
arabs, the arabic world will not care by and large what we do to Iraq.
Keep in mind that there were more arabic nations in the alliance against
Iraq than of any other nationality. We killed over 100,000 Iraqis on the
'Highway of Death' from the air, which left very significant evidence of
devastation. Thats as much as we could kill with a nuke. Nobody cried
then, nobody will cry when and if Iraq uses NBC weapons and we
retaliate. Islam is by and large a religion of peace, and most Muslims
have no respect for terrorist groups or states. They do beleive in eye
for an eye, but not endless tit for tat. The bad guy never gets the
right to retaliate for his eye taken by Islamic law...
