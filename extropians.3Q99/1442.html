Why, thank you.

Okay, a couple of points here.  First of all, I'm not arguing that
stable systems are rational; rather, I'm arguing that rational systems
are stable - or at least more stable than irrational systems.  Occam's
Razor isn't what makes rational systems stable so much as KISS, which in
American engineering slang stands for "Keep It Simple, Stupid". 
Irrational systems of the type that are commonly proposed around here -
that is, systems which attempt to force some particular set of goals as
output - are more complex than rational systems because of all the
special cases and the special-purpose code.  This, in turn, makes them
less stable.

<p>
My visualization of an objective, or "external", morality doesn't
involve an ideally rational means of evaluating goals.  Rather, I think
that some goals are "true", objective facts about the Universe, which
are there even when nobody's looking; and any rational system will
arrive at those goals, just as any rational system will conclude that
186,000 miles/second is the speed of light.

<p>
The goal system you hypothesize is *too* simple, like a "rational"
system for adding numbers that says, for all X and Y, that X + Y = 4. 
Certainly this system is much simpler than an actual calculator, but
even with Occam's Razor it still isn't true.
