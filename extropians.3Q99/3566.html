<a name="3701qlink1">The facts you state are true.  I'd like to see more discussion of extropian 
approaches to addressing problems in the Third World.  What kinds of 
realistic economic reforms could we support?  What kind of political action?  
What technologies should we advocate for development</a> in the and for the Third 
World?

<p>
<a name="3701qlink2"><a name="3577qlink1">Things like Grameen Bank's micro loans are a very extropic tool for 
encouraging enterprise in the Third World.  I wonder if there are other 
innovative tools like micro loans.  Grameen's cellular telephone company, 
that focusses on putting just one cell phone into a village as a start, is 
the kind of thing I think we should look for as programs to highlight as 
extropic solutions to Third World problems: It is said that villages in 
Bangladesh that have gotten a phone through this program now get better 
prices for the cash crops they are able to raise because they are able to 
check market prices in the city and not be at the mercy of middle-men with 
better knowledge.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3701qlink3">It's true that most people in the world don't have electricity, and I think 
the West's high-tech industries should be thinking hard about how to 
distribute the benefits of new technologies into the Third World as swiftly 
as possible.  In my opinion, working to get good power technology into the 
<a name="4366qlink2">hundred million villages of the world is as important as any other 
technological development we could advocate.</a>

<p>
<a name="3701qlink4">Finally, though, I think that the net WILL be crucially important.  I've 
discussed before my idea of building "Brain Seeds": Super-cheap, 
solar-powered, sat-connected net terminals.  I'd like to see design and 
development of such a tool become an industry-wide initiative in Silicon 
Valley and then competition among the high-tech billionaires there to support 
production and distribution of these as a philanthropic "gold standard".  
Development of a privately-supported network of web-sites offering basic 
literacy training and sound agricultural and village management advice could 
then become a way that almost anyone could participate in lifting the bottom 
third of humanity up out of abject poverty (and also of providing those 
hundred million villages a way to hear truth that their local tin-pot tyrant 
wants to quash).</a></a>
