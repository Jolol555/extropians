<i>&gt; I had a girlfriend long ago who said she saw auras.  Since she also</i><br>
<a href="1575.html#1635qlink1">&gt; believed in the efficacy of tarot and several other seeming delusions, I</a><br>
paid
<br>
<i>&gt; little attention.  More recently, I've heard the suggestion that people</i><br>
who see
<br>
<a href="1575.html#1635qlink2">&gt; "auras" are actually seeing a colour or two into the ultraviolet.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I understand that there *are* people who can see into the ultraviolet.</i><br>
Does
<br>
<a href="1575.html#1635qlink3">&gt; anyone know if anyone has compared the descriptions that test subjects</a><br>
<i>&gt; provide of what they're seeing with the descriptions that aura-seers</i><br>
<i>&gt; report?  Are there other plausible explanations for what these people say</i><br>
<i>&gt; they're seeing?  And any pointers to subject descriptions of UV colors?</i><br>

<p>
I've heard that the Japanese used people during WW2 who could see in near
infrared.  I don't know how true this claim is.  Though there are other
animals, e.g., bees, which can see in portions of the ultraviolet, I've not
heard of any humans who can.  I imagine it's possible and others on the list
might have information on this.  (Or David can do a search under "human
vision" in a reputable search engine.:)

<p>
<a href="1575.html#1635qlink4">&gt; Is there any evidence of any humans who can perceive other non-visible</a><br>
<i>&gt; EM wavelengths (besides coarse sensing of IR)?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; What uses are there for non-visible EM imaging of human bodies (besides</i><br>
<i>&gt; x-rays)?  Say, is IR human imaging useful in medicine, or can it be used</i><br>
<i>&gt; to estimate someone's emotional state?</i><br>

<p>
I've seen IR used to map surface skin temperature, which is supposed to be
useful in a wide range of things, from monitoring blood flow to the progress
of surface tumors.  However, I saw this on TV so it might have been an
oversell of the concept.

<p>
<a href="1575.html#1635qlink5">&gt; Is there any useful way to feed a broader spectrum into the brain other</a><br>
than
<br>
<a href="1575.html#1635qlink6">&gt; mapping it into the currently-visible spectrum and using the optic</a><br>
machinery?

<p>
Add more wetware onto the brain and integrate it.:)

<p>
Another technique might be to more broadly map colors so, e.g., that red
covers a wider range than just what we currently perceive as red.  You might
miss some details, but with this method, you need not add any fancy new
components onto the brain.

<p>
Anyway, it's all purple to me!
