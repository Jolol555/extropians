I am sending out this message as a call for papers from fellow professionals
in the area of future studies to share their vision and ideas with
professionals in the area of management of technology. The International
Association of Management of Technology is holding its millennium conference

theme "Technology Futures and Future of Technology". As coordinator I would
like to extend invitation to all fellow futurists to submit papers for this
session and share your vision with other professionals. The selected papers
will be refreed for publication.The abstracts or the full papers may be sent
directly to me via email &lt;akr2650@netscape.net&gt;
