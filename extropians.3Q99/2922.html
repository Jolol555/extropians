<p>
They do rely on "touch", they can also rely on sound (ultrasonic)
sonar which works quite well.  I think you may want to re-examine
some of use of light however.  In biology there is a lot of use
of confocal and I think some use of near-field microscopy.  As
I understand it, these do not have the same restrictions as
vision that requires "focusing" light rays.  Clearly the "eyes"
of the explorers shrunk to that degree would not work normally.

<p>
Perhaps one of our physicists would like to comment on the
restrictions of these methods.

<p>
There is a small discussion of the use of light for laser communications
in Nanomedicine.  This summer I went round-n-round with Robert Freitas,
my father (a laser physicist) and eventually a BU astronomer about the
problem of the absorption or emission of a frequency of light by an
emitter/absorber that is smaller than the wavelength.   The topic
is an important for both communication in vivo as well as because
the change in the black-body curves between "dust" and "macro-scale"
emitters is the feature pointed out by Kardashev required to distinguish
Dust-envoloped stars from Dyson Shells (a feature very near to my heart!).

<p>
Robert finally won the absorption argument when he pointed out that
a single chlorophyll molecule has a size much less than the wavelength
of the light it absorbs.  The BU astronomer gave me a reasonable
explanation about the dust emission [if anyone wants it I can send
it to them].

<a href="2916.html#2922qlink2">&gt; This is 5 million miles</a><br>

<i>&gt; residents of the blood bump into the walls and each other without damage,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but we know that bumping things at five million mph will cause great</i><br>
<i>&gt; damage.</i><br>

<p>
Robert F. has a a fairly extensive discussion of navigation problems
in NM, especially vis-a-vis the different flow rates depending on
distances from the artery walls.  It turns out that this issue
plays an important role on the sizes and shapes nanobots can have.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2916.html#2922qlink3">&gt; But from the point of view of a hypothetical nanomedical device, this</a><br>
<i>&gt; artistic device must be discarded.  The nanomachine would not be any</i><br>

<i>&gt; as proposed, it should be much stronger.  Further, the appropriate time</i><br>
<i>&gt; scale for its actions will be on the order of tenths of microseconds.</i><br>

<p>
Actually you would be surprised at the strengths of some of the materials
in your body.  There is an extensive table of these in NM.  The time
scales vary over a very wide range depending on a nanobots purpose.
