I'm considered something of an extremist, but I would have to say I'd
favor designing out large parts of the human cognitive architecture and
virtually all of human society.  So to give a short list of things I'd
like to see debugged:

<p>
Social bugs:
<br>
Corporations - replace with fluid contracts
Marketing - replace with collaborative filtering
Money - r/w automated barter
<br>
Countries
<br>
Private property - r/w two-tiered transferable/birthright system.
Authority and coercion
<br>
War

<p>
Biological bugs:
<br>
Old age
<br>
Pain - needs volume control
<br>
Disease
<br>
Eating - run off electrical power
<br>
Death
<br>
200hz neurons, 100 meter/sec axons
<br>
Genes
<br>
Carbon-based substrate - too flimsy, move to silicon

<p>
Cognitive bugs:
<br>
Hatred
<br>
Racism
<br>
Patriotism
<br>
Self-preservation instinct
<br>
Respect for authority
<br>
Existential ennui
<br>
Political/social intuitions - make conscious
Bipolar sexuality
<br>
Limited willpower
<br>
Self-awareness - needs augmentation and finer-grained architecture.
Individuality - needs extensibility; telepathy and group minds.
Stupidity

<p>
Children should be born with, and retain, around twice as many neurons. 
When possible, we need to link the human brain to a computational matrix
that can support indefinite growth in cognitive capacity.  The brains we
got now are WAY too limited.

<p>
In fact, I'm leaning towards the proposition that we should define de
novo AI cognitive architectures and then transfer the contents of our
minds inside.  It's sort of like the way transhumanists want to "upload"
themselves into computers by transferring an active model of the
neurology (and in fact you'd have to do that first), except working with
a higher level of substrate.

<p>
What should humanity leave behind?  Everything.  Our genes, our bodies,
our societies, our individuality, our cognitive architectures, and maybe
even our personalities.  The human era is over.  Fifty thousand years of
pain and death and stupidity; I say we bid it a DAMN GOOD RIDDANCE and
make off for greener pastures.
