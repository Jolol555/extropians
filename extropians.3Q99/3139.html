<a name="3149qlink1">But Reeve wouldn't benefit from the procedure, unless or until his current
body begins to fail.  And the new body, once headless, will presumably
begin to deteriorate as well.  Since he was reasonably athletic before
his accident he probably had a pretty good body to start with.  So it
would be some time before it would make sense for him to switch to a new
one.
