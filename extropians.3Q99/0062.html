<a name="0138qlink1"><a name="0133qlink1"><a name="0106qlink1">It's cool to see someone else on this list that does lucid dreaming.  I do
this, but it's not wide-spread as far as I know.</a>  I have had major periods
of overwork where I literally worked full time except for sleep.  By
controlling my dreams and simulating an hour on the beach or something, I
woke up more refreshed and ready to work again.  When I don't dream</a> (or more
<a name="0106qlink2">accurately, when I don't remember dreaming) it seems like I just went</a> to bed
</a>
<a name="0138qlink2"><a name="0106qlink3">and its time to go to work again, and I'm not ready to go back to work.</a>

<p>
<a name="0138qlink3">I also have performed real design work in dreams.  During the above</a> week of
<a name="0106qlink4">hell, I have gone to sleep, designed a solution to problems, and woke up
ready to implement the design the next morning.  I presented the design
idea, and actually billed time for the design work.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0138qlink4">This is not always reliable, however.  Sometimes you don't dream or don't
become lucid while dreaming.  Sometimes you don't maintain full lucidity.
You dream that you came up with a good design, and you wake up</a> and realize
that it doesn't make sense.  Sometimes dreams get weird</a> and seem reasonable
<a name="0138qlink5"><a name="0106qlink5">until you wake up.  Usually the consciousness achieved in lucid dreaming
prevents the random dream-generators from kicking in, but</a> occasionally there
</a>
<a name="0138qlink6"><a name="0106qlink6">is some overlap where the lucid dream still has some</a> fictional elements
thrown in.

<p>
<a name="0138qlink7">For those who don't know what we're talking about:  Lucid dreaming is when
you realize that you are dreaming.  You thereby become conscious</a> inside your
<a name="0106qlink7">dream.  Once you realize its a dream, you can control</a> it by visualizing what
<a name="0138qlink8"><a name="0106qlink8">you want to see, and the dream-generating facilities</a> of the subconscious
<a name="0138qlink9">take over and create what you visualized.  Basically, it is a
</a>
super-realistic holodeck.  Anything you can imagine seems to be real.  You
get full sensory feedback, so you can do long division on paper,</a> because you
<a name="0106qlink9">see the paper and the writing holds constant and seems real.</a>  You can think
<a name="0106qlink10">logically and generate a design or a check list in your head, and when you
</a>
wake up you have accomplished real work/planning while sleeping.</a>
