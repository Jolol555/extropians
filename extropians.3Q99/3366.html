<i>&gt; Mike, I usually agree with your posts, but I have to take issue with you on</i><br>
<i>&gt; this one.  Your point is well taken with regard to one-on-one interactions,</i><br>
<i>&gt; but when you start talking about large groups of people you have to take</i><br>
<i>&gt; into account the fact that some small percentage of them definitely *will*</i><br>
<i>&gt; be irresponsible.  That brings you to the question of benifit vs. harm (i.e.</i><br>
<i>&gt; if 99.9% of all users of X benifit, and 0.1% do something stupid with it, is</i><br>
<i>&gt; the net result good or bad?).  With most hazardous goods (dynamite, hand</i><br>
<i>&gt; guns, printing presses) the harm that one nut can do is relatively small, so</i><br>
<i>&gt; I don't see much of a case for government regulation.  With a few items</i><br>
<i>&gt; (nuclear weapons, and anything with similar destructive potential) the harm</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a single nut can cause is much, much greater than the combined benifits</i><br>
<i>&gt; of all the possible peacefull uses.  If you could buy a nuke at the corner</i><br>
<i>&gt; gun store some of those 'climb-the-tower-and-shoot-pedestrian' nuts would</i><br>
<i>&gt; use them, and the annual death toll would likely be well into the millions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If you want to allow private ownership of nuclear weapons, you need to move</i><br>
<i>&gt; society into space so that you don't have to live within the blast radius of</i><br>
<i>&gt; half a million basements.</i><br>

<a name="3376qlink2">I mostly agree with this, that the more destructive the technology, the more
room you need for individuals to be able to use them freely and safely, however
in a properly armed society where the majority understand about rational self
interest, such whack-jobs would be eliminated at some point between the womb and
their date with destiny. I know of no case of a numb-nut like Furrow, Lee Harvey
Ozwald, Sirhan Sirhan, etc. where the signs of a seriously disturbed individual
were not readily apparent long before hand, but nobody did anything, or what was
done was the typical treatment of a bleeding heart society.</a>
