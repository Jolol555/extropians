You haven't got the faintest idea what kind of person I am, and I didn't say 
unkind word # 1 until you flamed me for objecting to email on the list from 
egroups. I object to every posting that comes through from non-members. I get 
around 100 emails/day, and around 10 of them are spam, in case you think I'm 
just being crabby without provocation.

<p>
If majordomo had a "nomail" option, we could close the list, and people who 
use multiple accounts could subscribe from all of them and set all but one to 
nomail. 

<p>
If you want the last word, take it, I'm done.
