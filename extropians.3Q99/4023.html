We are all relatively smart people here, and we tend to live lives that keeps
us away from the common folk.  We tend to think that people with an IQ of 130
are average, and that people with an IQ's of 120 are pretty stupid.  I
sometimes watch talk shows in order to find out what stupid people are really
like.  They make my boss seem positively brilliant in comparison.

So our personal experience is dealing with intelligent people, who are highly
individualistic, complex, and flexible.  But this hardly is helpful in
understanding things like the OJ jury.  People who are average or below average
are very different.  And most of them seem to be stuck in a rut of typical male
or female type behavior.
