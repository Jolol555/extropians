Merrily we roll along, roll along, roll along,
More and more mainstream we go... 

<p>
CBS had a program on the "Search for Immortality"
on its 48 hour news show last night.  Sorry I
didn't know about it in advance, I think you
can get videotape copies.

An interesting segment covered discussions with
Ben Levinson, a very active 104 year old man
<br>
[If we could get him as a speaker for Extro5 this<br>
would be interestinging...].  Other segments
<a name="3718qlink1">discussed work by Michael West, the perspective
of cryonics and there is even a picture of
Brian Delaney and CR discussion [Is this *our*
very own Brian Delaney???].
</a>

<p>
And for those of you who don't watch the news eBay
stopped the sale of a kidney.  Story is interesting
from the perspective of "sales police".  Greg,
if you read this -- could eBay be held "liable"
for facilitating what would be an illegal transaction?
What if the transaction were to occur between two
non-US citizens?

Will Electronic Auctions have to move to
"The Libertarian State?" to be able to sell
stuff that more restrictive states disallow?

<p>
<a name="3815qlink1"><a name="3718qlink2">Does anyone know if the top level domains like:
".li" (or ".lb"), ".th", or ".ex" are taken and whether
</a>
<a name="3815qlink2">you have to be a country to get them?
</a>
