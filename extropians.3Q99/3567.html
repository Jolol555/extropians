<a name="3572qlink1">The same sort of thing will happen to me from my own Catholic upbringing, 
especially if I encounter the full blown "Magic Show" (as I used</a> to call the 
<a name="3572qlink2">Mass when I was an altar boy); it's almost like some kind of weird</a> drug rush.

<a name="3572qlink3">Interestingly, the memories don't fade for many people, but just go into a 
dormant state.  I think a big part of the resurgence in religious fervor in 
America now can be attributed to the reactivation of religious memes 
implanted in childhood among the Boomers by life situations they're</a> just now 
<a name="3572qlink4">encountering: Parenting and middle age career and physiological stress.  A 
whole panoply of programming was implanted in them, just waiting to be 
activated by these predictable events in the stages of a typical</a> human life.
