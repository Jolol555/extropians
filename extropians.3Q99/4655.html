Well, you my dear, don't need a loft to use your imagination vividly.  I've
enjoyed reading your posts and your riposte sensibility.  I especially like
your views on space and  architecture *and* sense of play.  

<p>
There is a line in the story that Oscar Wilde wrote which was recently made
into a film and released.  Rupert Evertt tosses out the phrase "tediously
predictable" (or close to it) in describing situations that were all too
tedious.  Such is the tedium of loftiness -:)

<p>
Cheers!
