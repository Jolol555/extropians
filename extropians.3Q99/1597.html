Eliezer,

<p>
<a name="1605qlink1">wow, so you are only nineteen!</a>  I imagined you being in your late fifties at 
<a name="1605qlink3"><a name="1605qlink2">least with a balding head and a professorship somewhere!!</a>  This is just 
amazing to me!  I'm very curious about what college you attend and what your 
major<a name="1605qlink4"> is.  If you tell me you work as a  gas station attendant and are not 
</a>
ambitious only wanting to learn about science for your own fun I will pass 
</a>out!<a name="1605qlink5">  Anchorage has a fellow with an extremely high I.Q. that I read about 
in the paper who is perfectly content as a heavy equipment operator but his 
friends freak when they see all the books in his home about theoretical 
physics and chemistry!</a>  What is your career goal?  When I read the extropian 
<a name="1605qlink6">song lyrics you wrote while inspired at a con I just thought "he's pretty 
hip for an old guy!"</a>

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
