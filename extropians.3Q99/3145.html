<a name="3223qlink1"><a href="3066.html#3145qlink1">&gt; &gt; As I recently said, "The solution would be corporate sponsorship."</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; If you value life, *value* life!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Imagine the following:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Welcome to Union Carbide High School, home of the UCHS Gassers...</i><br>
<i>&gt;because we care.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tonite our team is playing the boys of the Mighty Lockheed Bombers,</i><br>
<i>&gt;visiting from Ground Zero Stadium...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I am all for competition and merit in student acheivement, and no</i><br>
<i>&gt;mainstreaming. I am especially for competition and merit among teachers</i><br>
<i>&gt;(break the NEA monopoly), but pasting a corporate logo on my kid so he</i><br>
<i>&gt;can go to school? Thats the kind of irresponsible idea that the morons I</i><br>
<i>&gt;talk of in my prior post would be all for...</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
So you actually think that it's better to take money from people who happen 
to have preferences for lifestyles different from yours, at the point of a 
gun, money which is then allocated by bureaucrats with no stake in the 
outcome toward whatever passes for "education" among the elite</a> parasites 
from academia - the people who told my parents not to ruin me by teaching me 
to read at the age of three; wait for the experts to do it at six.  The 
jerks who spread racism throughout the South.  Right.
You might want to look into the FIRST public school - which was public in 
the sense that it was open to anyone - run at a profit by Lancaster in the 
18th century.  He educated half of London, including the poorest of the 
poor, and made money hand over fist.
<br>
The idea of corporate sponsorship vs. state sponsorship would almost 
certainly be a major improvement over what we have now in "education," which 
is mind-numbingly awful, for the most part.  However, I should also note 
that corporations are themselves children of the state.  I would much prefer 
private sponsorship and actual investment, similar to the successful 
microloans program.
<br>
<a name="3339qlink1"><a name="3287qlink1">A child in deepest central Africa should be able to get a loan if the 
creditors see a profit in it.  Of couse, if he were to form a personal trust 
and sell shares in himself, then he would have a vested interest in 
maintaining the value of the shares, as these would be his ticket to acquire 
further investment for going to college, starting a business, etc.  The 
internet has made this all quite feasible, by reducing the various 
information costs - transactional and risk.  It's just a matter of time 
before the businessmen start offering mutual funds that invest directly in 
people - kids as well as adults.  And I would sure bet my money on one of 
those kids long before I would hand over any cash to some kid who has been 
indoctrinated in the state schools.</a></a>
