<a name="0400qlink1"><i>&gt; &gt; firmly establishes that all the radio noise on whatever</a> frequencies</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; they're scanning is meaningless noise, this at least gives us some firm</i><br>

<i>&gt; &gt; civilizations.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; No way, they can't even draw this conclusion. They make the unbelieveable</i><br>
<i>&gt; assumption that any similarly or more advanced civilisation will be using</i><br>

Rob is correct, the light bulb regarding optical SETI is slowly
brightening (see www.coseti.org), but they openly admit that
fight is a very uphill battle.  The original paper by Cocconi
&amp; Morrison on Radio-SETI and the obvious frequencies to examine
was in 1959 (before the first lasers were demonstrated).
High bandwidth optical communication was simply pre-empted
by radio in people's minds because it got there first.  An
alien civilization might develop lasers before radio making
them think radio was a silly thing to use.

<a name="0380qlink2"><a name="0380qlink1">There is a quote by perhaps Kuhn or Clarke (?) that in effect
says that scientists never change their minds and that the
only way new ideas are ever accepted is for the old generation
to die off.  [Does anyone know the actual source of this quote?
Altavista seems almost useless...]
