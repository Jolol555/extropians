<a href="0711.html#0726qlink1">&gt; Some extropians, including Nick Bostrom, Andres Sandberg, Phil Goetz and myself,</a><br>
<i>&gt; are going to attend the World Future Society conference July 28 - August 2, 1999</i><br>
<i>&gt; in Washington, D.C.  - see &lt;<a href="http://www.wfs.org/9ga.htm">http://www.wfs.org/9ga.htm</a>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The conference will assemble 1200 to 1500 professional futurists</i><br>
<i>&gt; from all over the world, and we hope to do a good job there representing</i><br>
<i>&gt; transhumanist ideas.  Besides giving speeches and shmoozing, we are going</i><br>
<i>&gt; to have a table with transhumanist materials - articles, magazines, books,</i><br>
<i>&gt; flyers...   I expect it to have a good impact if we do it right.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We can have 20 or more different items on display, maybe 100 to 400 copies of each.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; We need, quite urgently, help with selecting materials, designing flyers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; printing, shipping, and paying for renting the table and copying of materials.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; If you can help in any way, please send mail to us (see cc list in this message)</i><br>
<i>&gt; shortly.  Please include your suggestions for selection of materials and</i><br>
<i>&gt; describe what you can do to help make it happen.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Thanks!</i><br>

I looked over the agenda, and it looks a lot like "idiots predicting the
future".  Besides Nick Bostrom's talk, I only saw one seminar that
looked 
<br>
interesting, on nanotechnology.

<p>
I live in Maryland, and I could help.  I'd like to meet you guys at
least, so I'd like to attend.  However, to be frank, I'm a little put 
off by the cost.  I know this probably sounds slimy, but I'll ask it
anyway - if I sign up to help, do I still have to pay the registration
fee?  I *wouldn't* ask, except that there really only looks like one
talk (Nick's) that I'd be interested in attending.

<p>
I could man the booth.  I could certainly help designing flyers and
getting them copied and distributed.  My wife is a graphics artist,
and I could probably convince her to help.  It's short notice though,
so we'd have to get the information material ASAP.
