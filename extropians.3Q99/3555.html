<a name="3576qlink1">Personally, I don't see these as inconsistent goals.  I'd like to see 
extropianism both influence society at large AND inform the creation of 
wholly new societies, some of which might well be described as "private 
</a>enclaves".  When we're working to influence society at large, I think we HAVE 
to be willing to compromise, but I'd like to maintain the intellectual rigor 
to be able to engage in the kind of experimentation in new societies and new 
polities that we discuss here from time to time.<a name="3570qlink1">  Thus, perhaps by the middle 
of the next century, we might see multiple enclaves developing</a> in cyberspace, 
<a name="3570qlink2">in ocean or island habitats on earth and in one or more habitats</a> off earth, 
<a name="3570qlink3">while at the same time many people in the old "mainstream" societies will 
have come to realize that the direction of successful segments of those 
societies has become more or less "extropian".
