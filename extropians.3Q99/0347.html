Yes, but how many of the programmers you know have actually read it (or
anything else on the topic, for that matter)?

Of course you build your code with gracefull error handling.  That's
assumed - otherwise you'll never break 10^6 LOC with anything useable.  In
the end it can't save you from the fundamental problem, however.  Your error
handling code will also have bugs, and so will the meta-error-handling code,
and so on ad infinitum.  Meanwhile, all that error-handling code is also
making your programs bigger, slower, and more prone to really subtle errors
that are especially hard to fix.

<p>
The only big breakthroughs that have ever been made on this front are based
on the idea of getting some automated mechanism to generate part of the code
for you.  Even then there aren't any magic wonder cures.  The compilers,
code generators, expert systems and whatnot also have to be debugged after
all, and they tend to be far more complex than ordinary code.  So we move
forward one small step at a time, and meanwhile the hardware guys are racing
away from us.
