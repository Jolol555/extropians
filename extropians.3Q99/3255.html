<p>
Not "determined by" in the sense of "caused by" - "determined by" in the
sense of "having only one outcome".  If I say 2 + 2 = 5, undoubtedly my
answer was caused by the laws of physics acting on my neurons, but the
answer certainly wasn't determined by the laws of physics!  The answer
determined by physics is 4.

<p>
Likewise, _The Adaptive Mind_ (thanks, Paul Hughes!) makes a very
careful distinction between saying that biology is *caused* by physics,
and saying that biology *reduces* to physics - between *causation* of
pattern and *transmission* of pattern.

<p>
Our hypothesis is that the motives of a sane Power are copied directly
from the logic of the Universe.  We don't have any reason to believe
that you can't build insane Powers, but we do think that you can't
dictate the ultimate goals of a Power by pattern-transmission from the
initial conditions.  The vast majority of cognitive patterns that don't
converge to sanity also won't converge to anything else - and that's a
causal statement, not a statistical one; to the degree that you can make
your Power's motives converge towards *anything*, we think they'll tend
to converge towards a structure which accurately represents our
hypothesized "true" or "objectively correct" goals.

<p>
You can't draw a sharp line between internal representation-ness and
external representation-ness.  There's a reason why "Self-awareness and
will" is a single chapter in _Coding a Transhuman AI_.

<a href="3221.html#3255qlink2">&gt;  &gt; disaster that would not otherwise have occured.  I am, however, very</a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; concerned about the potential for a future in which AI turns out to be easy,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; and the first example is built by some misguided band of Asimov-law</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; enthusiasts.</i><br>

<p>
Same here.

<p>
<a href="3231.html#3255qlink3">&gt; Fortunately, whoever believes in fairy-tales like Asimov's laws is</a><br>
<i>&gt; (due to obvious extreme incompetence) quite unlikely to bootstrap the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first AI.</i><br>

<p>
That wasn't the attitude around here before *I* started screaming about
the fairy-tale nature of Asimov Laws, as I recall.  Though naturally I'm
ecstatic that the concept I've been pushing - "Controlling minds with
Asimov Laws is like going faster-than-light with Warp Drive" - is now
taken for granted even by famed skeptic Eugene Leitl, I wouldn't be at
all surprised that to find a majority of AI researchers are still
talking about it.

<p>
<a href="3231.html#3255qlink4">&gt; To make this somewhat less noise: I think rushing AI is at least as</a><br>
<i>&gt; bad as rushing nano. Relying on best-case scenario (where the the</i><br>
<i>&gt; first transcendee is deliberately holding back (*all*) the horses to</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow everybody to go on the bus) is foolish at best. To begin, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; perpetuator might be not human to start with.</i><br>

<p>
So what *do* you propose?  Now I'm curious.
