<p>
Well, you could first call the cognitive scientists to ask if, during their
investigations, that happened across any wormholes or very long dense
objects that may explain how the information can travel from future to
present brain states.  Then you could call the theoretical physicists and
ask them if any of their new theories might allow for the time travel
abundant enough that natural selection could exploit it.  Then you might
want to give the evolutionary theorists a call and ask them why this ability
appears not to of been used in nature more extensively.  Then you might want
to give, say, *all* of science a call and tell them that nature appears
capable of practical time travel, if your theory doesn't account for this
you are most likely wrong.  These are quite big implications for some
anomalous stats.

<p>
[Btw, when the researchers find "data show some subjects making calls that
correlate with future, non-inferable states of the symbols" do they also
find the average of the entire set of tested subjects is higher than usual?
Or do they just test on an individual basis?]

Very badly indeed.  I think scientists would be justified in ignoring the
data until it became overwhelming.

No shit.
