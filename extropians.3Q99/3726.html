Looking again, I found that the article I mentioned is
still available at
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/080199japan-decline.html">http://www.nytimes.com/library/world/asia/080199japan-decline.html</a>&gt;.

According to Japanese government projections cited in the
article, Japan's population will fall to 92 or* 100 million
by 2050 and 50 or 67 million by 2100, and they're assuming
some recovery in fertility (currently at 1.4 children per
woman).  Another government projection cited claims that
the Japanese workforce will decline by 650,000 a year
over the next 50 years.

  <li>  The article cites two different sets of numbers.  Really
  poor editing.  Doesn't really matter since the projections
  are just that...

<a href="3571.html#3726qlink2">&gt; Look. This is a really interesting article you have presented. However, Japan</a><br>

<p>
This may be (except that Japan is about the size of California).
However, some people are obviously more concerned about Japan's
potential loss in international stature than the possibility
that a smaller population could conceivably be more comfortable.
I mentioned the article here because it struck me that
investment in longevity research could help mitigate both of
the "problems" faced by Japan according to the article --
too few workers to support retirees and a loss of international
importance.
