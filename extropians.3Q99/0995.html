So your saying that it is dogmatic to remain undogmatic? :-)  Very funny.

What may be practical for you is not necessarily for someone else.
If I understand you correctly, you are saying it is more practical
for you to remain stringently dogmatic on certain issues unless someone

P.S. I think you should write an essay titled 'On the Practical Uses
of Dogmatism'.  I for one would be very interested in reading it, and I'm
sure it will become a fascinating topic of debate on this list.
