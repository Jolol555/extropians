Abstract
<br>
  This study identified predictors of weight gain versus
  continued maintenance among individuals already successful at long-term
  weight loss. Weight, behavior, and
<br>
  psychological information was collected on entry into the study and 1 year
  later. Thirty-five percent gained weight over the year of
  follow-up, and 59% maintained their weight losses. Risk
  factors for weight regain included more
  recent weight losses (less than 2 years vs. 2 years or
  more), larger weight losses (greater than 30% of maximum
  weight vs. less than 30%), and higher levels of depression,
  dietary disinhibition, and binge eating levels at entry into the registry.
  Over the year of follow-up, gainers reported greater decreases in energy
  expenditure and greater increases in percentage of calories from fat. Gainers
  also reported greater decreases in restraint and increases in hunger, dietary
  disinhibition, and binge eating. This study suggests that several years of
  successful weight maintenance increase the probability of
  future weight maintenance and that weight
  regain is due at least in part to failure to maintain
  behavior changes.
