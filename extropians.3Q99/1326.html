Energy density is not a realistic measure of danger.</a> If the energy is in the
form of infrared photons there is no problem, an equal amount of energy
in the form of X rays or Gamma rays and there is is a problem. The sinister thing
about neutrinos is that there is no way to hide from them and most of the energy
in a supernova is released in the form of neutrinos. About 20 neutrino's
were detected from the 1987 supernova in a thousand ton tank of water and it was
about 200,000 light years away. The numbers I'm using are from memory but I
don't think they're too far off.  If it were 6 or 7 light years away, that's 30,000 times
closer, and the flux would be about a billion times greater.  Thus a 200 pound man
would receive absorb about 2 million neutrons. A neutrino on the very rare times
it hit something would do a lot more damage than the more usual types of radiation
like ionizing photons or high speed electrons or protons, it would be almost as damaging
as an alpha particle. Usually such a hit would kill the cell it happened in and 2 million
dead cells wouldn't be much of a problem for a large animal like a human, but sometimes
the cell wouldn't die but become mutated and that's not good. Natural radiation
is probably a major cause of cancer and in this case you'd be receiving a massive
dose in less than a second.
