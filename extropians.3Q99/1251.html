<p>
As someone who has worked in software documentation, when the manual is
piss poor its because the programmers wrote no internal comments in the
source code, wrote little or no internal documentation, and won't give a
pathetic technical writer the time of day, at least thats in my
experience, but I come from an engineering background, so I do have
technical proficiency. I do know how difficult it is for a technical
person to deal with a humanities person. What do I have to show for it?
1850 pages of reference manual, half of which I inherited from the
previous job holder who was an archaeology major, and all of which the
customers take one look at, shrug their shoulders at, and call tech
support. They don't even use the online help most of the time either.
