I know that feeling.  The surprising part is that my father *is*
very web literate.

Ditto.  Even though my father is 75 and I'm 42, the gap remains.

<p>
The resource is an emotional resource that doesn't change much as they
realize that you may actually be able talk, walk and even think for yourself.
The illusion disruption occurs when independent outside notice to allows
the light bulb to slowly brighten.  My family did a reality check at my
Wired News quote from the Extro4 conference.  Parents have to expand their
perspective to allow holding multiple images of you simultaneously.  Some
don't manage to accomplish this (and so deny the existence of some images).
Some only manage to flip from one image to another (so you always have
to check who they believe they are interacting with).  However, it is
entirely feasible to get people to interact with *you*, rather than the
image(s) they have of you.   It usually isn't easy though.
