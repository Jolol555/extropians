*Image of Electron Orbitals Confirms Controversial Bonding Hypothesis. Using<br>
a combination of convergent beam electron diffraction and X-ray diffraction
techniques, a team of materials researchers at Arizona State University have
achieved startlingly clear images of electron orbitals responsible for
bonding in Cu2O, also known as cuprite, a ceramic semiconductor with a rare
structure.

*Virginia Tech Researchers Create New Family Of Molecule, Solve Fullerene<br>
Processing Mystery
<br>
BLACKSBURG, Aug. 30, 1999 -- Leaky lab equipment and Virginia Tech
researchers' eagle eyes have resulted in a new family of molecules with
potential applications ranging from medicine to optical-electronic devices,
and beyond. The researchers report in the Sept. 2, 1999, issue of Nature
that they can produce C80 fullerenes containing three metal atoms
("Small-bandgap endohedral metallofullerenes in high yield and purity").

<a name="3586qlink1">*For decades, pharmaceutical companies have struggled to overcome the<br>
molecular equivalent of the Great Wall of China: the outer membrane of
cells, which prevents all but the tiniest of proteins from entering. Now
researchers have slipped a protein that's more than 200 times larger than
the average drug into the cells of living mice and shown that the protein
functions.

hard-to-find hematopoietic stem cells. The researchers, in identifying a
chemical beacon – a protein marker – on the cell, believe the new work will
lead to laboratory production of all types of blood cells for transfusions
and innovative approaches for bone marrow transplants and gene therapy.

*Future riches may lie in genes Companies with potential to revolutionise<br>
health care set to be stockmarket stars.  WHEN the first biotechnology
companies went public in the 1980s, US stockbrokers likened the investment
opportunity to buying [ Xerox ] or IBM at its initial public offering. So
when the genomics firms tapped the public markets a decade later, it was no
surprise that the analogy that brokers made was to [ Microsoft ] . There may
be more than a germ of truth to this genomics pitch. If you believe that
some companies have the potential to create a new industry, or to alter the
rules for an existing one, then those are stocks to own for the long term.
The thesis behind the genomics companies is that deciphering all the genes
that make up the human genome, or the sum of the body's genetic information,
will prompt huge changes in health care. In this vision, gene-based
diagnostic tests will predict disease years or decades before it occurs, and
drugs of extraordinary specificity will prevent or cure illnesses such as
cancer, heart disease and stroke - without side effects. The leading drug
companies have already paid hundreds of millions of dollars to the genomics
firms to gain access to their data, and the betting is that the health-care
system will one day pay billions for genomics-based drugs. The shares may be
volatile, and investors may want to use big movements as trading
opportunities, but basically, those who believe the thesis may want to own
them almost regardless of how expensive they become. And those who do not
believe it, of course, may want to stay away. Shares of two of the biggest
gene merchants have been on a tear as investors have reacted to several
gene-related discoveries announced by Maryland-based [ Human Genome
Sciences ] . Shares in Human Genome, the early player and the only one to
take its own drugs into clinical trial, are up more than 80 per cent since
January 1. They closed on Wednesday at US$71.375 more than three times their
52-week low of $22.75 last September. The stock of [ Millennium
Pharmaceuticals ] , based in Massachusetts, has tended to follow that of
Human Genome, even though Millennium has yet to develop drugs of its own.
But it has reaped more than $1 billion from corporate partnerships and plans
to acquire a drug later this year. At its closing price of $62.50 on
Wednesday it has more than doubled since January 1 and is up sixfold from
its low last September. The other two big genomics stocks are in companies
that sell genetic data-bases to big drug companies.
In comparison to those in the first category, their shares seem like value
stocks. Celera Genomics Group Maryland was spun off from [ PE Corp ] at
$21.31 a share in May. It closed on Wednesday at $30.625. Shares of Incyte
Pharmaceuticals of California closed at $28.25 on Wednesday down more than
20 per cent since January, largely because of the perception that an
independent Celera poses a threat to its core business. Michael Murphy,
editor of the California Technology Stock Letter, recommends a basket of
Human Genome, Incyte and Celera. "Own all three, because what you want to do
here is get a position in what will clearly be the basis of medicine in the
21st century," he said. He thinks Human Genome could hit $150 by 2002 but
has not established targets for the others. Mr Murphy excludes Millennium
because it has diversified into agriculture and diagnostic sectors, and he
no longer sees it as a pure genomics play. But that assessment is not
universal. Viren Mehta, an analyst with Mehta Partners, a health-care stock
research firm, thinks Millennium has the best business model for both
finding partners and prospering on its own. "What is important to remember
is that up to now, the majority of drug discovery successes of smaller
companies had to be shared with larger companies," he said.
"It is quite likely the future will be no different." Most big-selling drugs
are pills, which must be based on small molecules produced through medicinal
chemistry, province of the big drug firms.
"Millennium has chosen to first establish a robust scientific
infrastructure, and from there to create very lucrative partnerships, where
a substantial portion of the combined success will still become the
exclusive property of Millennium," Mr Mehta said. "If you are going to buy
one stock and put it away for your grandchildren, which will it be? We have
recommended Millennium for a long time."
But other analysts say Millennium's future remains dependent on the success
of its partners or the acquisition of a compound that may become a
successful drug, for which it will have to compete with the same
deep-pocketed companies it partners with. Human Genome Sciences is alone
among the genomics companies in having created drugs - three of them, all
undergoing clinical trials. "We tend to favour companies that not only
supply genes or data bases to corporate partners but, most importantly, can
develop their own drugs," said Anthony Butler, an analyst with [ Lehman
Brothers ] , which took Human Genome public in 1992. "It's amazing what just
one drug will do for your value," Mr Butler said.
