<a name="0768qlink1"><a href="0611.html#0699qlink1">&gt; You don't know enough about math for your opinion to count. No insult</a><br>
<i>&gt; intended. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
It's true, I know zilch about math, but I don't hold this as relevant.</a> I
<a name="0768qlink2">argue with statements made such as below:

<p>
<a name="0775qlink1"><a href="0611.html#0699qlink2">&gt; Math is math, and is the same math everywhere in the universe.</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
You and everyone else on this planet have absolutely no evidence whatsoever
for this immense assumption.</a> It doensn't matter that maths can describe most
things we have encountered...it may not be the exact tool that dissimilar
civilisations use. True, there are probably basic similarities, but no way
will I buy that any civilisation would certainly understand one of our
equations when faced with it, even having explained the symbols etc...</a> Basic
<a name="0768qlink3">concepts such as why, how, systems thinking and linear time may not be as
they are here due to the brain (or equivalent) structure of the observers,
providing a very different perspective from which to view and therefore
describe the universe.</a>


<p>
<a name="0768qlink4"><a href="0611.html#0699qlink3">&gt; Any species more advanced than us is going to KNOW any math that we</a><br>
<i>&gt; know. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
They will know the natural systems/laws/relationships that the math
describes, yes, but no way will they definitely describe it in exactly the
same way as us.</a>


<p>
<a name="0768qlink5"><a href="0611.html#0699qlink4">&gt; They will know other maths, but if they are interested in</a><br>
<i>&gt; communicating with primitve species, they will use maths that are common</i><br>
<i>&gt; among primitive societies. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
If such commonality exists.

<p>
	Remember - in all this, I MERELY point out that you people CANNOT be
as cocksure as you seem that all civilisations throughout the universe will
use math exactly as we use</a> it.
