Thought I would pass along a comment about the recent vote 
on building a state prison next to Stellafane by Sky &amp; 
Telescope columnist John E. Bortle.

Yes...Stellafane will certainly suffer. Living so close to 
the Green Haven facility (near Stormville in Dutchess County,
New York), myself, I can appreciate much better the impact 
than can most others. Just wait until the residents of 
Springfield find out how little such a facility will 
contribute to the local economy. Sometimes you get what 
you deserve!

<p>
To add:  If the Springfield residents themselves do not 
care about natural places in their own town, should they
then go to rot just because they don't want "outsiders"
taking care of places they don't?  Outsiders, carpetbaggers?
What is this, the nineteenth century?

<p>
It is also a shame that the town chooses a prison as a
way to try and boost their economy, rather than with
something more positive and productive.  View Michael
Moore's film Roger and Me to see how not to boost the
sagging economy of a US town in trouble.
