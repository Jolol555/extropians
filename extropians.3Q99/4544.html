Cynthia,

<p>
Just wanted to mention that your definition of "Reality" or "Truth" is precisely
that of Pragmatism, that is, the theory of knowledge developed by the 19thcentury
 American philosophers Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and
others, according to which the test of the truth of a proposition is its practical
utility; the purpose of thought is to guide action; and the effect of an idea is
more important than its origin.

<p>
There is a special school of pragmatist thought called "Instrumentalism" which
is an even closer fit.  This position maintains that the truth of an idea is
determined by its success in the active solution of a problem and that the
value of ideas is determined by their function in human problem-solving.

<p>
All the best,

<p>
Bob
