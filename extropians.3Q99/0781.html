<p>
A few weeks ago, the question came up about choosing mates
for physical attractiveness or mental ability.  The comment was
made that women choose differently depending on where they
are in their fertility cycle.<a name="0806qlink1">  During the nonfertile period, women
gravitate toward the nerdy, stable, brainy guy, but during ovulation
they crave the handsome rogue with the protruding buttocks.</a>

<p>
An idea occurred to me: assuming the above theory is correct
(ladies, please comment if you wish to reopen this discussion)
and further theorizing no societal intervention or controls of
any kind, then<a name="0806qlink2"> the stable nerds would end up with most of the
sex (since the females would be infertile most of the time) and
yet most of the offspring would, oddly enough, resemble the
handsome rogue.  Correct?</a>  Since our society has invented
<a name="0811qlink1"><a name="0806qlink3">marriage, which makes it less convenient (at least) for the
women to visit Mr. Buns during the fertile few days, it seems
that societal restraints would serve to tilt the scales back in
favor of Mr. Brains.  Right?</a>  Does this explain why humans
<a name="0806qlink4">are getting more intelligent over the past few millenia?  spike
