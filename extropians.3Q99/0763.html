Good point -- and I think there's an option to turn that off, or rather a 
text-only version of the program, which would speed everyone up, but 
especially the Celeron. Since mine is running mostly when I'm not there, I 
shouldn't care much about the pretty graph.

<a name="0774qlink1">I am just about to move into the top third of all SETI@home users, with only 
4 work units completed -- this says to me that a lot of people sign up and do 
0 or 1 and then drop out. We appear to have about 10 such people out of 40 on 
the ExI/&gt;H team. Also, we have &gt;half of our total results from the top 4 
members -- if any of them have stopped running, that would explain how the 
Mormons got ahead :-)

I'm not sure how current or accurate the stats are on the www site, either.

<p>
And, no, I don't think CHEERLEADING: will catch on as a topic prefix :-)
