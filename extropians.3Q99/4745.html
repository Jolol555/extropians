"House Approves Bill That Would Make Class-Action Suits Harder<br>
to Win"

<p>
It is a general effort to move class action law suits from state
courts into federal courts.  The article comments on efforts
(and contributions by) companies involved in tobacco, guns
and health care to push this legislation forward.

<p>
Quotes:
<p>
   "This represents a sealed, locked, closed and forever impenetrable door
     to justice," said Representative Sheila Jackson-Lee, Democrat</a> of Texas.

<p>
<a name="4908qlink2">    Other opponents called the bill a form of "backdoor immunity" for tobacco
    companies and gun makers.

<p>
    "Opponents of the legislation said it was outrageous</a> for a Congress that
<pre>
<a name="4908qlink3">     had left so many Federal judgeships vacant, by failing</a> to confirm White
<a name="4908qlink4">     House's nominees, to be broadly expanding the caseload of an already
     overworked Federal judiciary."
       { the rationale being that moving cases from the state courts to the
         federal courts would result in their being delayed</a> or simply thrown
         out. }

</pre>
<p>
<a name="4908qlink5">The bill was gnerally supported by Republicans and opposed by Democrats.
