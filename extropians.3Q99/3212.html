saying that Extropianism is somehow better than general transhumanism,</a></a></a>
because extropianism is focused on finding ways to actually become
transhuman.</a>  Leaving aside the question of how any one of us can know what
the 'best' way to achieve this is, that ignores a wide range of activity
within wider transhumanism including:  

<p>
(i) Drexler recently went to Europe and met with many general
transhumanists such as Sarah Marr in London with the intent of setting up a
chapter there

<p>
<a name="3236qlink2">(ii) life extension societies are located all over Europe,</a> 

<p>
<a name="3236qlink3">(iii) the Swedish transhumanist society is very technically focused, as is
</a>the Danish group

<p>
(iv) the general transhumanist group in DC is full of people working in the
fields of cryonics, computer programming, and aeronautics, not to mention
the rapid-response cryonics team that is trained in preserving a body until
it can be transported to the West Coast.  

<p>
(v) general transhumanists participate in many of the technical forums
sponsored by ExI, Foresight, and other organizations.

<p>
<a name="3256qlink2">I hope that you will take some time to acquaint yourself with the
activities going on around the globe among general transhumanists before
making such statements.</a>

Sincerely,
