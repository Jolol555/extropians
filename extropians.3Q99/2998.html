You -- and we -- should.  Like (just about) everything else in nature, 
rationality and self-control are distributed on a bell curve.  By and large, 
extropians and transhumanists are at the good end of these curves.  There ARE 
people at the other end and they CAN be dangerous.  It only takes one 
psychopathically obsessed nut-case to cause a tragedy.  Perhaps because I 
spend time down at the courthouse, I may be more sensitive to the weird and 
the violent, but let me urge everyone to simply be aware of the POSSIBILITY 
of one or more Bad Crazies becoming obsessed with opposition to 
transhumanism.  Especially folks who have made a public commitment to 
transhumanism and extropianism should exercise some common sense in being 
aware of their environment and not disregarding signs that could indicate 
you've become the focus of some misguided person's violent obsession.
