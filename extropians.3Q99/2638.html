<p>
We don't know that for certain.  [Since we never saw the original
egroups subscribe list and don't have the source for the software to
know exactly how it works!]  "You have been added to the ... group"
may simply mean that we were suggested as a "potential" subscriber.

<p>
I will agree that it is possible we were subscribed (some have
indicated that their experience with such lists argues that), but we
never received any messages from eGroups (to my knowledge) other than
the original invitation.  It is the rapid escalation that occured after
a single invitation that I consider fairly unextropian.

<p>
If a person does something to stir up trouble, then we should be
particularly on our guard not to overboard.  If you think we have got
people baiting us now, it is likely to get much worse as the organization
becomes better known.

I have to disagree.

<a href="2484.html#2638qlink5"> &gt; http://www.lucifer.com/exi-lists/extropians/4736.html (measured response)</a><br>

<p>
   Accusing someone of "harassment" and "theft" and suggesting "punitive 
action"
<p>
   is a little more than what I would call "measured".

<p>
The other "flames" go even further.  There were several private responses
in my part in attempts to mediate the positions and provide some education.

<p>
I think we may forget that not everyone we encounter has 25 years of
experience on the Internet.  From time to time someone who doesn't
know Netetiquette is going to appear and IMO we should try to respond
to those situations a little more gracefully.

<p>
A long time ago I learned an approach that goes something like this:
  (1) The first time something happens, it may be a random occurence.
<pre>
      You should look at it carefully to determine whether it is good
      or bad, represents a threat or not and raise your awareness
      regarding the conditions in which it occured.
  (2) The second time something happens, there is a good chance that
      there is an underlying habit or law involved and if the
      thing is a threat or undesirable you should work aggressively
      to prevent it from happening again.
  (3) The third time something happens it *is* a recurring activity
      following a "law" and if you don't like it or want it you
      should do everything in your power to wipe it out.

</pre>
<p>
I would suggest that the flames were generated around level 1
when they should have occured someplace between 2 &amp; 3.

<p>
After all the noise, I'm giving some consideration to joining Anders
in that distant unused corner of the Galaxy waiting for the
"Sandberg Era" which is likely to arrive quite quickly after
SIs derived from a subset of the extropian list subscribers
have finished throwing all the stars at each other. :-)
