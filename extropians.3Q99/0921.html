<p>
Lee,

<p>
You seem quite proud of your skeptical prowess, but I don't think you even 
read my response, judging from your last post.  For the last time, here is 
where I stand in relation to "crackpots," rabid and otherwise.

<p>
_This_ post provides a very instructive lesson on the rhetorical tools used 
by people who can't tell nonsense from speculation.  I hate getting into 
these inane arguments, but this post was too personal and just plain 
wrong-headed.  

<p>
<a href="0702.html#0921qlink2">&gt;&gt; The processed images of the Face have produced a wealth of evidence </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;consistent with artificiality, though the controversy is far from over.  </i><br>

<p>
<a href="0702.html#0921qlink3">&gt;"Consistent with" is a great weasel phrase.  All the "wealth of evidence"</a><br>
<i>&gt;(by which he means 3 pictures) is also "consistent with" the fact that</i><br>
<i>&gt;it's just a bleeping rock.  Suggesting that there is a controversy when</i><br>
<i>&gt;there really isn't one also helps; there's only a controversy because</i><br>
<i>&gt;a few hard-headed idiots won't face the facts.</i><br>

<p>
Could it be a rock?  Absolutely.  But not only is the Face formation 
consistent (yes, _consistent_) with the Artificiality Hypothesis, it actually 
confirms some of the features just hinted at by the original Viking frames.  
And where did you get "three pictures"?  I think of at least 100 shots of 
Cydonia and areas with similar topology that have helped in the development 
of the Artificiality Hypothesis, not to mention any number of studies using 
everything from fractal algorithms to CAD imaging to classical sculpting 
techniques.  

<p>
Again, I'm not saying the Face on Mars is an ET artifact!  But it's worth a 
closer, better look.  I stand by this quite strongly.

<p>
<a name="0962qlink2">I didn't create SPSR (though I'm flattered by your accusation).  SPSR is a 
group of trained scientists of various types who single-handedly convinced 
NASA to take a second look, and who have presented papers at the American 
Geophysical Union and elsewhere.</a>  I might add that not all of them even 
endorse the Artificiality Hypoethesis.  But they know an anomaly when they 
see it, and they've done soem awfully good work on the subject.  Since you 
seem to be aware of them, I'd like your reaction; they may not be popular, 
but you'd have to have a real problem to accuse them of being crackpots.

<p>
Oh, jeez.  Bad word choice!  You got me!  I might add that I know full well 
that I'm _not_ writing for "the masses."  I got on this list because I 
suepected there was a general level of intellectual sophistication that you 
just don't get on, say, "Unsolved Mysteries."

a 
<br>
<a href="0702.html#0921qlink10">&gt;&gt; very touchy and completely falsifiable hypothesis which needs further </a><br>

<i>&gt;system is completely legal"; "This is not spam".  Direct denial of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;obvious is cheap and surprisingly effective.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0934qlink1">Same as above.  You're going to considerable lengths to make me look stupid, 
</a>
and all you can dredge up is this?  

<p>
<a href="0702.html#0921qlink12">&gt;&gt; I recommend the websites of Dr. Mark Carlotto </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (www.psrw.com/~markc/marshome.html) and Dr. Stanley McDaniel </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; (www.mcdanielreport.com) for background information.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Nothing like a paid-for PhD to make people take you seriously.</i><br>

<p>
A biographical sketch of _MR._ Mark Carlotto's can be found here: 
<a href="http://www.psrw.com/~markc/MJCbio.html">http://www.psrw.com/~markc/MJCbio.html</a>.  His work on the Face made the cover 
of "Applied Optics," he was a contributor to Carl Sagan's "Cosmos" series, 
etc. 

<p>
I wouldn't be recommending someone's work if I thought they weren't for real. 
 It may of interest that Carlotto has yet to write _anything_ proclaiming the 
Mars anomalies as "real."  He's simply taken vital, completely reproducable 
steps with the evidence we have in an attempt to arrive at a conclusion.  
I've always thought that was good science.
