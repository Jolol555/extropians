<p>
It really goes beyond that.  It isn't that the authorities don't give a
damn, it is that there is essentially no force of law in terms of State and
Federal authority.  Many locales are simply too remote for traditional
authorities to project force.  Things can get really weird in some places;
in some cases, it is like being in a completely different country.  Also,
there is so much unused State land, that you can pretty much do what you
want, as long as you aren't bothering anyone else (which is improbable as
the population density is extremely sparse in most areas.  Nevada, where I
live, is similar.).

<p>
Instead of centralized authority, you essentially have these interesting
little kingdoms and duchies that are run by whatever group owns them.  The
same people that own them are also usually the local
sheriff/judge/legislature and make and enforce laws to suit their whims.
Some of the areas are amazingly oppressive, and others are pretty much
anarchic in nature.  Having traveled briefly in some of these areas, I find
it to be an interesting experiment, really.  Most people live in the nice,
loosely regulated (i.e. non-oppressive) areas.  The only people who live in
the oppressive areas tend to be those who are in a position to benefit from
the local regime.  In many of the most oppressive areas, Constitutional
rights are often routinely violated, but one has to pretty much accept this
to live in the oppressive areas.

<p>
What is even more interesting is how the law is dealt with when it involves
multiple local jurisdictions, particularly as it applies to enforcement of
contracts and apprehending criminals.  What has evolved looks not
dissimilar to the PPA model of law and contract enforcement, with the PPA
being the government of whatever little locale you live in.  (Note that the
locales in the areas I've visited have populations ranging from dozens to
maybe a couple thousand people, with most areas having a few hundred).  

<p>
I don't have time right now to go into this, but Alaska is a really
interesting experiment-in-progress regarding what happens when people are
left to themselves with no outside law imposed upon them.  The result is
that one can find a locale that will suit just about anyone's tastes.  My
overall impression was very favorable and the net results seem to be
roughly what is predicted by some anarchists and libertarians.
Unfortunately, I don't think the experiment has fully developed because the
population densities are simply to small for it to reach its full
potential.  I'd love to see this happen in a state that has a somewhat
higher population density.
