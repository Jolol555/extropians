<p>
I took the normal SAT in 1991, at age 11.  Are they doing the PSAT now?

<p>
And of course, it doesn't prove I'm 19; but as Edwin Evans points out,
if you know that I'm no older than 22, then you can probably assume I'm
19.  Good one, Evans!  That never occurred to me as a verification
source, and it should have.

<p>
I wish I'd thought to show that to Damien Broderick before he sprang his
"Brooklyn grandmother" line on me in _The Spike_ (of course, I had no
idea he was going to do that until I read the book; otherwise I'd have
figured out some way to verify things and destroyed a perfectly nice
line, which is probably why Broderick kept it as a surprise).

<a name="1962qlink1">FWIW, Brian Atkins has physically met someone who looked like a
teenager/young adult, claimed to be me, and knew the contents of emails
<a name="2002qlink1">sent to "sentience@pobox.com".  Someone who claims to be my father,
Moshe Yudkowsky, is known by a number of SF fans and will be at Worldcon
this year, and will verify that his son has an email address of
"sentience@pobox.com" and was born on September 11, 1979.  (Or he may
claim I'm an android he bought from Macy's, or that he's never heard of
me.  We're a little silly down here.)
