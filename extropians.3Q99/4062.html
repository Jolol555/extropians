I understand what you are saying, spike, but as in interim thing, isn't it
great that so many different kinds of people have written and sung and
painted and danced about what it is like to be them, and that your wife has
tried so hard to explain to you what it is like to be her and so forth?
I'll bet that not only do you have some idea about those lives but that all
these other shadows of experience have colored yours.
