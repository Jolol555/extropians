<a name="3012qlink1">For those of you who missed it last night (or perhaps this
morning), there was an X-files episode in which an AI
pioneer, specifically mentions wanting to *upload*
her mind and her boyfriend's mind so they could merge
together.</a>  The upload destination was supposed to be an
AI, but unfortunately it got too smart, had built
had built itself a safe-house in a trailer at the end
of a T3 line on an abandoned farm and escaped from the
lab into the trailer.  It then started targeting defense
satellites to eliminate its creators.  It was even
clever enough to capture Mulder and try to force him
into revealing the location of the disk kill viruses
on it (by cutting off Mulder's arms in a VR).

<p>
<a name="3010qlink1">Holy mackeral, are the X-file writers reading the
extropians list???  Which one of you is it --
Hal, Eliezer, maybe Greg isn't really a lawyer
after all...</a>

<p>
The next thing we are going to find out is that
the X-aliens are really an SI hiding behind Mars.

<p>
A quick search doesn't seem to find this show in the
episode list on www.X-files.com, does anyone know if
it was a repeat and what the episode name was?
<br>
{Stupid TV-Guide.com doesn't go "backwards".  What a<br>
ridiculous world we live in that I have to go
"buy" a magazine to get the program listing for
a show that I've already seen!}

<p>
In general though, I *hate* having our legitmate
scientific perspectives mixed up with what is
mostly UFO abduction crap.

<p>
Off the topic suggestion, perhaps the proper response to
the people sending us threatening letters is to add a
page to the Extropian WWW site

<UL>
  <li>  [Notes to anti-transhumanists]
   Please be advised that we will happily arrange for any
   anti-transhumanists threatening any extropian to be
   abducted by our alien overlords and taken to Mercury
   where they will be staked out under the hot sun.


</UL>
<p>
    Then follow this with a long list of the cases in
    the Bible where there were alien interventions...
