<p>
<a href="4373.html#4385qlink2">&gt; there isn't enough metal in the Galaxy to "optimally" hide them all yet.</a><br>

<p>
Consider the function  P(m)  which describes the most P(ower)you can extract
from a star given a certain amount of available M(etal).
Since you can choose not to use metal, P must be an increasing function.

<p>
If you have two stars, and are trying to extract the most power from
them, and you have a certain amount M of metal available, your problem is

<pre>
  max           P(m1) + P(m2)      such that  m1 + m2 = M
      m1,m2                              and  m1 &gt;=0,  m2 &gt;=0

</pre>
<p>
<a name="4390qlink1">You are suggesting that an optimum is m1 = 0 and m2 = M, putting all
the metal at one star so as to get every last photon and reradiate at near
3K, while completely leaving the other star alone.   This requires that
P''(m) &gt; 0 on average, with *increasing*, not diminishing, returns.
</a>

<p>
<a name="4390qlink2">Instead I expect any plausible model of metal-limited Dyson sphere to
show decreasing returns: The first few tons gives lots of power while
the last few tons gives a lot lot less.  This implies that to get the
most power one shoul spread the metal evenly across the two stars:

<p>
   m1 = m2 = M/2    .
