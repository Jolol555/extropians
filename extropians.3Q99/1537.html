I knew I had seen that theme in a SF book at some point. There is also The
Duck in
<br>
Spider Robinson's Callahan's stories, same deal -- improbable stuff happens
around him
<br>
constantly. I think it's pretty craven of an author to use
something that remarkable and not take a good shot at explaining it.
Robinson can be
</a>
<br>
excused because no one would mistake his stuff for hard SF, but Niven ...
sheesh.
