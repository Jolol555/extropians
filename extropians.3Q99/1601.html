Have to agree with you there.

<a name="1947qlink1">I tend to see most of our technological goals as fairly inevitable,
given no major disasters,</a>
<br>
I do, however, somewhat fear the reaction of the existing power
structure(s) to the existence of an intelligent, organized and
determined group intending to take advantage of those technologies.
I don't have much faith in the "Guvment' really putting all the pieces
together in time to do anything too meaningful, if they're not handed
the agenda on a platter.

does anyone know how seriously the portions of it that we would find
most attractive are viewed?
