<a name="4824qlink2">Imagine you're learning to drive.  As your driving instructor I have decided
that the car is too complex a beast for my students to learn.  Instead I
teach you to drive a train.  As my first student to learn by train I'm very
pleased to see you're not diverting from your course, unlike my former
students.  You learn quickly and soon you're ready to hit the streets in a
car.  Many people are killed.

Pascal was designed on the premise of teaching programming by restricting
what the programmer can do.  This is both evil and fascist.
