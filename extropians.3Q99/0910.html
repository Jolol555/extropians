<p>
Don't get me started.  Most women seem to have an underlying contempt for 
men based on the fact that men like them and are willing to spend virtually 
any effort to have physical contact with them.  What this says about their 
opinion of themselves goes without saying - so to speak... ;)  
Unfortunately, this contempt is often justified, at least in the context.  
How many times have you seen some guy making up a whole romantic fantasy 
about some female whose only virtues are a carefully practiced smile and the 
right topology?

<p>
Also, the first thing that most women want someone in a relationship to do 
is to compromise.  Among groups of women, they all tell each other some 
embarrassing secret.  That proves trust supposedly, and then they feel safe 
to be intimate.  This behavior carries over to how they deal with men.  The 
man is supposed to tell them all kinds of sweet lies, proving that he cares 
more about them than the facts of reality.

<p>
On a related topic, even among women - the "libertarian," or "extropian" 
women to whom you refer - who do have something on the ball, isn't it 
obvious that they are not judged by the same standard - by men?

<p>
There are some very smart and responsible women in the world, but how many 
times have we seen airheads running organizations made up largely of 
brilliant men who allowed some ambitious woman to take the reins simply 
because they wouldn't stand up and state the plain truth: "you don't know 
beans about the subject matter, and you have no business running this 
organization."  Fact is that women tend to love group projects and 
"organizing," and being the leader and getting to determine who gets to 
speak is a real rush.  After all, unlike men, women are taught from birth to 
make their relationships with others the primary purpose and goal of their 
lives.  Their own personal capabilities in the real world are of secondary 
importance - or so the cultural programming goes.  So a lot of these 
obnoxious "leaders" are just women running with that ball.

<p>
Then the best people leave and the organization is slowly run into the 
ground.  One of my tests for women - or men, although it rarely applies in 
their case - in positions of power is attention span.  Usually I can come up 
with something worth saying that takes about a minute to say.  In the same 
context, most of the men - say 90% - usually have no problem listening for a 
minute.  They expect good ideas to take time to present.  About an equal 
percentage of the women, however, glaze over at 30 seconds.

<p>
This is not to say that there aren't plenty of airhead men out there.  When 
they try to get into positions of power, however, they tend to get judged 
more critically, and that expectation no doubt stops a lot of the would be 
power seekers in their tracks.  In technically oriented organizations, the 
men in power tend to be overqualified and are usually stealing time from 
their work, at which they are often the top of their craft.

<p>
<a name="0915qlink1">rant, rant, rant - you can fill in the blanks from here, as I know that most 
men have had these experiences.</a>

<p>
I really feel for the women who are very competent and who constantly fight 
the battle of being seen first as a female and then also being judged by the 
kind of experience I noted above.
