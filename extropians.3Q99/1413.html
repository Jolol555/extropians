Recently, I had this idea, not that I think it's a new one, but I believe it
should be investigated a little...

<p>
<a name="1457qlink1">In what kind of society would we live if for each financial transaction, how
little it is, a small percentage of this transaction was assignated to a
zero sum lottery ?
<br>
you buy a car, a TV, a gsm, a chocolate, a fruit, a house, a beer, a
service, wathever, a small percentage of the price is invested in a
permanent and fast lottery for you in an automated way. That would be
</a>
totally enforced by law.

<p>
If the parameters of the lottery game were correctly settled, would not we
be able to live in a society with a very huge dynamic of consommation, very
good for industry and employement but with some kind of great equalizer for
the people provided by the lottery ? The best of both worlds in some sense.

<p>
Certainly, I don't have a clue about economy ;)... Is this idea naive,
already have been investiguated or something else ? what do you think ?

P.S

<p>
<a name="1457qlink2">an interesting and fun side effect would be to select the Darwin way a more
lucky society, for sure we really need it for the future ;)
