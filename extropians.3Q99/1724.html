It was the relatively late Neanderthals that had that pattern.  
Nobody's found clear-cut spear more than a few hundred thousand
years ago, but then again wood spears wouldn't preserve well.

<p>
H.erectus made "hand axes", some of which were basically stone
frisbees with the edges carefully sharpened all the way around.
Nobody's figured a way to use those particular hand axes other
than by throwing and, since they slmost always hit with the 
sharpened edge, they are about as effective as a thrown rock
can be.

<p>
Earlier bipedal hominids didn't have such wicked rocks.  The 
Australopithicenes (Lucy) have not been found to work rocks 
at all.  They do seem to have used digging sticks.
