<i>&gt;it's better to live in shame rather than die in honor.</i><br>

<p>
I love these "It's better to....." snippets. They suck ass. They only apply
to the person making the statement. It's back to the old "everyone thinks
like me" mistake. The writer of this statement obviously attaches great
importance to existence for the sake of existence (perhaps the fear-o'-death
instinct is very strong). I, amongst others would disagree with the initial
statement, though. I'd sooner live for 5 seconds of pleasure, than 500 years
of sucky shite the idiotic human race has created for itself. Where'd I put
that exhaust-hose ?

<p>
Rob.
