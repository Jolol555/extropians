<p>
Here is an update on the Extro 4: Biotech Futures Conference.

<p>
Please send this to anyone you think might be interested, including any
mailing
<br>
lists where appropriate.

<p>
Registrations are coming in strong. We're still tweaking the program -- I'm
looking to find a Rifkinite to debate our gene patent expert Dr. Kate
Murashige. So the Program may yet be updated again. I'll also be adding
directions to the campus, information on checking in to the dorm rooms, etc.
just as soon as I receive it from the on-campus manager.

<p>
Onward!

You are invited to Extropy Institute’s fourth conference:
B I O T E C H  F U T U R E S
<br>
Challenges and Choices of Life Extension and Genetic Engineering

<p>
August 7-8, 1999, UC Berkeley

<p>
BIOTECH FUTURES brings together a unique group of researchers and thinkers to
examine the technology and implications of extending the human life span and
altering our genetic constitution.

<p>
The formidable array of speakers at BIOTECH FUTURES will cover everything from
existing technologies to emerging technologies such as artificial chromosomes
and stem cells to future applications of nanotechnology to intervene in human
biology.

<p>
In the research arena, we are delighted to have speakers such as Dr. Calvin
Harley, Chief Scientist at Geron Corporation. Geron has done or funded much of
the recent starting breakthroughs in stem cells, telomerase, and now the
nuclear transfer techniques used in cloning. Prof. Cynthia Kenyon, whose work
on extending the life of c. elegans has received much publicity, will present
her results and next steps. Prof. John Campbell of UCLA will explore existing
and future technologies of genetic engineering.

<p>
Other top speakers including Vernor Vinge, Natasha Vita-More, and Greg Bear
will examine the philosophical, legal, artistic, and psychological aspects of
extending human lives and altering our genetic code, with a Saturday evening
address by Max More, President of Extropy Institute, on the desirability of
amending the human constitution.

<p>
This event will go beyond presenting ideas, no matter how informative and
stimulating. Biotech Futures includes sessions showing what practical steps
are
<br>
being taken in these areas, and sessions to help all of us communicate unusual
ideas more effectively to the public.

<p>
Several excellent speakers and sessions have not been mentioned here. For a
full list of speakers and the program, please see:

<p>
Space is limited for the BIOTECH FUTURES conference and places are being taken
fast. So please register right away if you don’t want to miss this unique
event. People are coming from around the world to converge on this conference.
Don’t miss out on the concentrated information, intellectual excitement,
creative thinking,
