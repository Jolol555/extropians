Gibson's cyberpunk stories anticipated many things about the modern
internet, and then took it a few steps farther.  Didn't his first book come
out in 1983 or thereabouts?

<p>
Ever since I'd read Gibson (and hung around on BBS's, and then had an
internet account), I'd been waiting for something like the Web to show up.
But I was astonished at how soon and how fast it all happened, and how many
things were made possible that I'd never imagined before.
