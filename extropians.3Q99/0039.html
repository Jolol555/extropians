It seems to me that the choice of causes for which one is willing to die is one of 
those ultimately personal choices. If one makes the choice rationally (as not 
everyone does), one takes the chances of success into account as well. If open 
opposition has a 99% chance of landing one in a prison camp or shallow grave, it 
seems intelligent to take some other path, such as escape if &amp; when the opportunity 
presents itself.

I hired a Czech robot scientist (George S----) when I was a section head in realtime
 systems at DG. He had driven his family into Austria on "vacation" in 1987 
(from Poland), by trying different border checkpoints until he found one where the 
guards didn't give a flying rat's ass about the rather improbable amount of stuff 
in the car for a simple camping trip, or the exact state of their papers (the third 
try, I think it was). In fact, that particular guard was sitting with his feet 
propped up waving cars through. Anyway, George immediately contacted a refugee 
network in Vienna, who put the family up and helped them work on their U.S. visa. 
When he was situated in the States in a good job, he turned around and pumped time 
and money into the same network, and (I think) into covert aid to the resistance 
movement. The strategy worked well enough that in 1990 or so he was back in 
Bratislava hoisting tall beers with his old colleagues (OK, actually he was 
Slovakian, but "Czech robot scientist" sounds better, _pace_ Capek :-).  

<p>
The time had to be right, and a doctorate in hard science had a lot to do with his 
success with the INS, of course.

<p>
One of my systems support guys came by and said, incredulously, "you hired a WHAT?" 
right after the offer went out. When George had been here three weeks, he made a 
special trip back to my office to tell me what I already knew, that George was one 
hell of an ass-kicking software engineer, former academic and furriner or not. One 
of his colleagues later described him as "an engineering machine." I am quick at 
picking up new stuff, but George took the prize. He came in and read manuals for a 
couple of days and then started slam-dunking all our hard problems.
