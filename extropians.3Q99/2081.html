Ken, my not mentioning your Extropy Online article on Idea Futures in my 
brief talk was a gross oversight on my part.  My only excuse is that the 
timeline presentation we made was not at all what we'd hoped for, since the 
Crit server went down duing most of the time we'd hoped to collect input, 
derailing most of our plans.  As a result, our presentation was a rather 
hastily conceived program to try to present at least the flavor of what we 
hope to accomplish by the time of the next conference.  I highly recommend 
your article to al concerned with the valuable Idea Futures tool.
