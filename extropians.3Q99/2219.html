<p>
Yes, it needs to choose, it needs time for processing, it needs time to think
because it doesn't know what state its mind will end up in regarding the issue
in question. Turing proved that issues exist that can never be resolved ( the
computation never stops) into a satisfactory mental state, and frustratingly
he also proved there is no way to identify such impossible problems. Everybody
has problems that bother them, we ignore them for a time and do other things
but they gnaw at us and we go back to them for another try. Sometimes we
eventually win and the problem stops, sometimes it never does.

<p>
Some things are futile to work on, but we don't know what they are.

<p>
No because nobody can escape Turing. Well ... an egoless man might, but I
don't believe in Zombies.
