There is some very interesting thinking about beauty published recently,
and all of it stirs 'controversy', because it compels us to actually think
about how we treat others and why!  I have been keeping up with some
studies on the topic and am glad to see an actual book with a scientific
slant.  Cultural notions of beauty is a highly relevant transhumanist
topic, because as we move into more sophisticated technologies of body
modification those notions will be either challenged or reinforced.

<p>
<a name="3807qlink1">Other books on beauty:  Also just published--_The Mass Market Woman_, which
discusses Western beauty ideals and how some men and women seek cosmetic
surgery to conform to those ideals rather than to explore their individual
creativity.  I heard an interview with the author on NPR last week.  Naomi
Wolf's _The Beauty Myth_, an excellent book which deconstructs the very
idea of female beauty as a cultural tool of sex role enforcement.  And,
Paula Begoun's series _Don't go to the Cosmetics Counter Without Me_, uses
chemistry and science to attack bogus cosmetics claims and to talk about
what skin care products actually do work.  She has become wildly popular on
the Internet and on television, a good example of science going mainstream.</a>
