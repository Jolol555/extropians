Abstract
<br>
  Potassium reduces blood pressure in populations at high risk of developing
  hypertension, which suggests that potassium depletion may increase vascular
  resistance. This study was designed to examine the effect of potassium
  depletion on the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway in arterial tissues. New
  Zealand White rabbits were fed either a control diet, containing a normal
  amount of potassium, or a low-potassium diet for 1-3 wk. As expected, the
  low-potassium diet resulted in reduced serum and urinary potassium levels.
  Carotid arteries were excised, and their contractile and relaxant responses
  were determined in vitro. Carotid arterial ring contractile response to
  norepinephrine was enhanced, and relaxation in response to the
  endothelium-dependent vasodilators acetylcholine and calcium ionophore
  A-23187 was attenuated, in rabbits fed low-potassium diet (all P &lt; 0.01
  compared with responses in rabbits fed control diet). The vasomotor responses
  were similarly altered in rabbits fed low-potassium diet for 1 or 3 wk. Both
  the enhanced contraction and attenuated relaxation were abolished by
  treatment of arterial rings with superoxide dismutase but
  not by treatment with L-arginine or indomethacin. Carotid artery rings from
  rabbits fed the low-potassium diet showed approximately 100% greater
  superoxide anion formation than those from
  rabbits fed control diet (P &lt; 0.01), whereas plasma and urinary nitrite
  levels were similar in both groups of rabbits. These observations indicate
  that low-potassium diet enhances the sensitivity of the carotid artery to
  vasoconstrictor stimuli and reduces the sensitivity to endothelium-dependent
  stimuli. Attenuation of endothelium-dependent relaxation appears to be
  secondary to increased free radical generation, which may
  degrade nitric oxide. Altered vasoreactivity may underlie the genesis of
  hypertension in populations consuming diets low in potassium.

Abstract
<br>
  Although endothelium-dependent vasodilation is impaired in human
  hypertension, the mechanism underlying this abnormality is not yet completely
  elucidated. It has been suggested that accelerated inactivation of nitric
  oxide (NO) due to superoxide anion, which
  is rapidly removed by superoxide dismutase (SOD) in
  physiological condition, may be related to hypertension. Therefore, SOD
  deficiency following an increase in superoxide
  anion production contributes to a rise in arterial blood
  pressure (BP). We hypothesized that there is defective endogenous SOD in
  patients with essential hypertension. To examine this assumption we measured
  the SOD activities of the erythrocytes in 335 healthy Chinese volunteers (age
  2-76 years) and 30 hypertensive patients (age 60-75 years). The SOD
  activities of the healthy volunteers exhibited decreased trend with advancing
  aging. There was no significant difference in the SOD activities between men
  and women in each group. There is significant difference in the SOD
  activities (1814.35 +/- 250.00 vs 1584.06 +/- 126.19 u/Hb.g; P &lt; 0.001)
  between the two groups (age 20-59 years; mean age 34 years vs age 60-76
  years; mean age 67 years). The SOD activities in patients with essential
  hypertension were 1322.4 +/- 139.5 u/Hb.g and significantly lower than the
  corresponding healthy controls (P &lt; 0.05). In the hypertensives, the SOD
  activities against systolic and diastolic arterial pressure seem to be shown
  the trend of negative correlation but did not reach the statistical
  significance. We conclude that the SOD activities in the erythrocytes are
  reduced in subjects with essential hypertension and increasing aging. The
  present findings, in a limited data, could suggest that the fall in SOD
  activities following an increased
<br>
  superoxide anion production with
<br>
  subsequently augmented NO inactivation is, at least in part, involved in the
  pathogenesis of human hypertension, although the evidence is indirect. The
  decrease in erythrocyte SOD activities may serve as a function of human
  aging.
