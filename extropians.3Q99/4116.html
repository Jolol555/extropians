<p>
Not only that, but the nudity was sub-par too.. ;)

<p>
My recommended Heinlein trinity to read:
Starship Troopers
<br>
The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress
<br>
The Cat Who Walks Through Walls

<p>
I think the three of these together would turn anybody into a
libertarian...

<i>&gt; intent.  Maybe he did it on a dare or something, just to see if</i><br>
<i>&gt; he could make a movie with a completely opposite point of view</i><br>
<i>&gt; to the original story (I'm amazed anyone in Hollywood still</i><br>
<i>&gt; deals with scum like Paul Verhoeven, whose history of broken</i><br>
<i>&gt; pomises and sleazy deals would make a movie itself).</i><br>

<p>
He actually was trying to recapture the sensationalist patriotic flair
of 40's &amp; 50's media, along with the feeling he had as a child in London
during the Battle of Britain. The concept of the brain sucking slug was
actually a dig on the way that collectivist societies (i.e. the bugs,
Nazis, Communists, etc) suck the humanity out of its population. I was
ticked that they didn't even try to replicate the power augmented suits
in the novel.

Is there a movie being made? Oh goodie...</a>
