Since "alien" civilizations are likely to be very old and very
technologically advanced, there are likely to have evolved into
the few "optimal" configurations that physics may allow.  However
it may not be possible to prove that those are the only optimal
configurations (thinking along the lines of Godel and incomplete
mathematical systems).  So to continue the evolution of the galaxy
one has to allow young civilizations to evolve and grow up along their
own paths, intervening as little as possible (The Prime Directive).
That allows a unique/diverse civilization to emerge and mature with the
possibility of discovering a new "optimal configuration".

<p>
Greg Burch has come up with the rather unique idea, that in an
"old" galaxy, there is a shortage of new memes, and we (collectively)
are about to become a "virgin bride" for an lecherous old civilization.

Michael Papagiannis (a BU astronomer) suggested in the mid-1980's that
they might be here and are simply observing us from the asteroid belt.
Even earlier, Robert Freitas had conducted several searches for alien
observation satellites in logical places (L5 points, etc.) and had come
up empty handed.  He also wrote several articles about our gross inability
to detect many alien technologies.

<p>
The problem has become worse since our understanding of nanotech has
increased.  Robert has calculated that nano-aliens could rapidly construct
a 1-meter^2 fiber-optic communications grid covering the face of the planet
that harvests substantially *all* of our information flow, transmits it
to a secret data store which beams it up to the mother ship every night.
I've done some calculations that seem to indicate that the waste heat
flowing from your body through your chair could power about a giga-op
nanocomputer.  It records everything you say or do, then hops off your
chair at night, plugs itself into the net and transmits that information
to the "Master Overlord".  In fact, the Master Overlord has recently
decided that you represent a threat to the "increased diversity" plan and
instructed your house-watch-bot to replace you with a directly controlled
nano-clone at the earliest opportunity....

<p>
There is a distinct possiblity that the increased belief in "little
green men", abduction stories, etc. are nothing more than disinformation
seeded into our culture to keep us from doing the serious and careful
investigations required to discover the nano-aliens.

<p>
My major concern is that everyone at the Extro4 conference is going
to be nano-clone so I might as well not even bother going.
