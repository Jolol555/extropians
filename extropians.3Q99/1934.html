All,

<p>
I think many are forgetting exponential growth tracks and
leveraging your investments.


<p>
<i>$1			Put it in a bank in Switzerland</i><br>
<i>$10			Put it in a bank in Japan</i><br>
$1 Hundred		Put it in a bank in the U.S.<br>
$1 Thousand		Buy all the nanotech books &amp; put them in<br>
<pre>
                        libraries in Russia
<br>
<i>$1 Million		Give the money to Zyvex.</i><br>
<i>$1 Billion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.</i><br>
<i>$1 Trillion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.</i><br>
<i>$1 Quadrillion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.</i><br>
<i>$1 Pentillion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.</i><br>
<i>$1 Sextillion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.</i><br>
<i>$1 Septillion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.</i><br>
<i>$1 Octillion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.</i><br>
$1 Nonillion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.<br>
$1 Decillion		Start a company for nanoassembler research.<br>

<p>
The first amounts aren't big enough to do much with so you should
balance the safety of the funds with growing it into something
more robust.  The library play leverages the skills of people
who don't have access to the information that we do.  The Zyvex
play leverages a company already on the track (since there isn't
enough to leverage it yourself).  At the point you can really do
something ($10 million+), then you should focus entirely on getting
a nanoassembler.  Greater amounts allows you to spread a wider net
and get there sooner.

<p>
Spending the funds on *anything* else is a complete waste of time
because your are simply burning it if you do anything that is
based on non-nanoscale technologies.  After the assembler/singularity
everything gets so compressed the costs drop by 2-3 orders of magnitude
(at least), so you can't easily judge how to spend "current" dollars.
