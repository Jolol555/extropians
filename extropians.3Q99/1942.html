of &gt;view, this list seems to be just a bunch of people who like to jabber
"about &gt;anything".  You seem to have no rules for posting, if so the rules
should be &gt;posted nightly.

        Though you are very correct in your assertion that this list has
many people who "jabber about anything," it is only one list of quite a few
which are available on future-related topics.  This particular list is
fairly free in form (in regards to posting) and the rules are given to each
address as it joins this forum.  One major point, however, is that this
list is not indicative of the way the Extropy Institute is run, nor of many
of the progressive efforts individual members are involved with "behind the
scenes." Personally, this list has become a decreasing part of my life in
the years I have been involved with Extropy, and am currently working on
other projects which have more value in this area.  So in a nutshell, this
list can get tedious, but if you stay tuned into some of the other
developments alongside this semi-casual forum, it can retain at least
*some* enjoyment.
