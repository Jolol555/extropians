<p>
I'm pretty new to cryobiology so I'm not actually capable of holding a
"highly technical" discussion.

<p>
<a href="1647.html#1828qlink2"> &gt; precisely beforehand and take care not to patronize those of us who are</a><br>
<i> &gt; sharing legitimate and truthful experiences. So far, you haven't said much</i><br>

<p>
Look, if we have difficulties at very basic concepts this will lead
exactly nowhere. Let's assume "frozen" means that the entire organism
has undergone a phase transition to ice. No residual fluid, little if
any water glass present.

<p>
<a href="1647.html#1828qlink3"> &gt; in this thread other than to attempt to discredit the first-hand</a><br>
<i> &gt; observations of fellow list members.</i><br>
 
<p>
I cannot hardly try to discredit "observation", because as used in
this particular context it can mean basically anything. Let's go for
"measurement", ok?

<p>
So, how do you know how much of the tissue was frozen (in above sense)?
 
<p>
<a href="1647.html#1828qlink4"> &gt; Personally, I don't give a chilly rat's ass if a fish frozen to -10F is not</a><br>
<i> &gt; "technically" frozen. What I care about is that it seems that an animal in</i><br>
<i> &gt; this state has none of the typical traits we associate with living</i><br>
<i> &gt; creatures, yet can survive the ordeal and thrive upon thawing. Instead of</i><br>
<i> &gt; chastising us for our venacular use of language, why don't you educate us</i><br>
<i> &gt; as to what is happening in the body of that fish and those flies, and what</i><br>
<i> &gt; it suggests for the future of human cryonics. After all, most people here</i><br>

<p>
I thought it was pretty obvious that a nontrivial organism that is
frozen cannot spontaneously resume functioning (and its repair is well
beyond our capabilities). Also, long-term stability of cryogenically
stored biological systems is only viable below -80..-100 deg C (best
vitrified and stored at ~-130 deg C, somewhat higher if vitrification
agents with higher glass transition temperatures are used). At this
temperatures the phase transition is complete, which incidentially
damages the organism sufficiently (with the exception of a few
primitive, hardy critters).

<p>
Temperatures used by Suda give preservation on week and month
scale. At this temperatures both deterioration is not arrested, and
devitrification is a very rapid process (i.e. you can watch the ice
crystals growing in the glass).

<p>
<a href="1647.html#1828qlink5"> &gt; don't care if it's an ice sitzbath, a dip in liquid N, a shot in the arm,</a><br>
<i> &gt; or a combination of those and other technologies that allow us to extend</i><br>
<i> &gt; our 'natural' life spans - perhaps to a world with technologies capable of</i><br>
<i> &gt; vastly lengthening that span, perhaps to new worlds all together.</i><br>

<p>
All this is very laudable, but one should try to keep the science/BS
ratio in the constructive regime.
