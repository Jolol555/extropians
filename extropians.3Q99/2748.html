I don't think that mailing lists provide the depth of interpersonal
interaction (not to mention economic transactions) that you need to have a
real society.  MUD-type systems can get closer, but what you really want is
a virtual community with decent bandwidth and facilities for exchanging real
money.

<p>
<a name="2817qlink1">That aside, I think the single bigest barrier to creating purely virtual
states is ensuring their independence.  Right now, such a community would be
very vulnerable to attack by nation-states (especially the state its servers
are located in).  Since just about every country with decent Internet
connectivity also participates in a web of international mutual extradition
treaties, it would be very difficult to set up an independent legal regime.
On line theft, fraud, and other serious (i.e. widely recognized) crimes will
end up being punished by some physical country, which means that the virtual
states can never actually have sovereignty.</a>

<p>
This is one reason I want that vestigial national government - it can
prevent the localities from making war on one another, which forces them to
compete within the rules of the market.
