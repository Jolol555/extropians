I like the idea of cities that are amphibious. Visionary architect Glen 
Small's flying buildings look like large winged jellyfish that propel through 
space. I see cities that migrate. Moving from underwater to land, perhaps 
even 'exoterra' for a season. One of the most tedious and limiting aspects of 
building today is proper footings. (earthqukes,  slides, etc) Even with nan, 
some of that will still apply, unless we find a way to mobilize our 
structures and allow them to move through water, mud and other matter, and to 
change with the weather patterns.
