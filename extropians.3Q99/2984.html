live.  Those who are burdened by irrational belief systems are simply
those who compete less effectively.  In the end, their silly beliefs
will disappear.  I would say, not freedom from religion, but rather
freedom from oppresive government!!  The only way to increase the speed
of technological change is to foster an open, dynamic society which
allows kooks in Kansas to raise their children to be imbeciles (without
stealing anyone's earnings) as well as allow me to teach my son that
god is just pretend.</a>

"If you love wealth more than liberty, the tranquility of servitude better than the animating contest of freedom, depart from us in peace.  We ask not your counsel nor your arms.  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.  May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen."   --Samuel Adams
