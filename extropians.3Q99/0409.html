<a href="0359.html#0409qlink1">&gt;I thought "Songs from the Stars" was one of the most well-thought-out SF </a><br>
<i>&gt;novels I'd read up to that point and would still recommend it today.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Question: Has anyone considered that the basic technological idea behind </i><br>
<i>&gt;Sagan's "Contact" seemed lifted pretty much in toto from "Songs"?</i><br>

<p>
I thought that came across loud and clear, as a matter of fact.  I was really 
disappointed with Sagan's novel--though I thought the movie was excellent, 
though it had a few technical flaws that really bugged me.  As far as the 
SETI paradigm goes, I'm enthusiastic but skeptical.  It's certainly a worthy 
endeavor.  The scenario in Moravec's "Mind Children" excites me a hell of a 
lot more.
