Just as most geniuses are men, but not all men are geniuses.

<a href="2657.html#2813qlink2">&gt; Yes, women, on average, have been slower to start using computers than men,</a><br>

<a name="2871qlink1"><i>&gt; In the last four years, having a personal computer has become exponentially</i><br>

<i>&gt; person was interested in games, programming, pornography, spreadsheets,</i><br>
<i>&gt; Compuserve, or wordprocessing, there wasn't really a lot you could do with</i><br>

Having come back to computers since the advent of the GUI myself, I can
say that the practical uses of computers have ben obvious to any
intelligent person since about 1991. It is true that most women have
only picked up using PCs (and usually start off with macs) in the last
4-5  years. Prior to that my experience tells me that women have had a
greater distrust of the technology, with no rational basis for the fear.
