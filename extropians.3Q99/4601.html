Perhaps increased violence is directly related to better health care.  Just
as promiscious sex was (no doubt) increased by the introduction of
contraceptives.  However, because you don't (usually) want to get hurt
whereas you do (usually) want to get laid, we prefer to watch fictional or
consensual acts of violence.</a>

Modern society is created by wild animals for wild animals.  I don't buy the
whole mans 'true nature' vs. civilisation thing.  Once you've got a big
general problem solver (and I'd say the brain fits this description) it's
difficult to put specialised code into it.  It's unlikely that my brain even
knows what concepts such as 'hunt' and 'prowel' are, but it probably knows
what hungry is and can figure out how to put an end to hungry.  I doubt it
could care less whether this be by 'supermarket' or 'hunting'.</a>
