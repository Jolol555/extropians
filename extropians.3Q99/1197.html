Junk Science
<br>
Longtime Advocates supporter Toby Nixon sent us the following clip,
which appeared in The Federalist: 
<br>
A freshman at Eagle Rock Junior High won first prize at the Greater
Idaho Falls Science Fair. He was attempting to show how conditioned we
have become to alarmists practicing junk science related to
environmental issues. In his project, the young student urged people to
sign a petition demanding strict control or total elimination of the
chemical "dihydrogen monoxide." 
<br>
And for plenty of good reasons, since it: 
can cause excessive sweating and vomiting 
is a major component in acid rain 
<br>
can cause severe burns in its gaseous state 
can kill you if you accidentally inhale it 
contributes to erosion 
<br>
decreases effectiveness of automobile brakes 
has been found in tumors of terminal cancer patients 
He asked 50 people if they supported a ban of the chemical. Forty-three
said yes, six were undecided, and only one knew that dihydrogen monoxide
was... water. 
<br>
The title of his prize-winning project was, "How Gullible Are We?"
