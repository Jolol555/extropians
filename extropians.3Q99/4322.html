I've been recently reading the "Homes &amp; Land" edition for Malibu
Beach/Beverly Hills just for the amusement value (I like astronomic
numbers).  Some of the waterfront property depicted is just so
*obviously* begging for trouble, especially in such fault-infested
areas as L.A. county I wonder it is so sought-after.

I don't think that too many of these folks who have opted for dramatic
views really realize how dramatic this views can get when even a
modest tsunami is heading your way. I think I would get very twitchy
in one of these houses if I actually had to live there.

But those Californians are all crazy, anyway.
