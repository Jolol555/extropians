<a name="4849qlink1"><a href="4828.html#4842qlink1">&gt; J. The Zen Doctrine of No-Mind asserts that the belief that</a><br>
<i>&gt;    one possesses a self is a delusion; that the self is, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    reality, nothing.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B. Let me rephrase this for the sake of illustration: No-Mind</i><br>
<i>&gt;    asserts that the dreamer is the dream, the dancer is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    dance,  the hearer is the sound, the perceiver</a> is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;    perception.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="4843qlink1">I have yet to see a waltz without a waltzer.</a>  If you have a reference 
for such a thing, please send it ASAP.<a name="4849qlink2">  The perceiver is NOT the 
</a>
perception!  Perceiver, perceiving and perceived are inseparable but 
distinguishable components of perception.  One may perceive 
many different perceiveds and still be perceiving, and one may 
perceive a specific perceived in many different ways; they thus 
cannot be conflated without error.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="4828.html#4842qlink2">&gt;    There is nothing in the stream of consciousness except a</a><br>
<i>&gt;    fleeting succession of images and feelings; there is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;    which is seen, but no seeing of seeing, there is that</i><br>
<i>&gt;    which is felt, but no feeling of feeling.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Explain how such phenomena as a seen bereft of a seer, or a 
feeling without a feeler, can possibly obtain.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="4828.html#4842qlink3">&gt;    Descartes' "Cogito ergo sum" means simply "there is the</a><br>
<i>&gt;    thought of thinking" then "the thought of a thinker" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;    finally the thought "if thought then thinker" and that is all.</i><br>
<i>&gt;    "Believer" can be directly substituted for "thinker" and</i><br>
<i>&gt;    "belief" for "thought".  Thought if and only if thought.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Directly translated, it says "I think, therefore I am."  Your 
interpretation is your interpretation of Descarte's statement, but not 
the statement itself.  "I think, therefore I am" obviously means that 
<a name="4849qlink3">the presence of thought logically entails the existence of a self who 
thinks (the thinker of the thought).</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="4828.html#4842qlink4">&gt; J. However, if one does indeed possess a self, then there</a><br>
<i>&gt;    is no delusion involved in believing that one does.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B.But the Zen position denies the substantiality of any</i><br>
<i>&gt;    temporally self-identical entity within the stream of</i><br>
<i>&gt;    consciousness. There is no dreamer and the dream</i><br>
<i>&gt;    of a dreamer is a dream. What happens to the dreamer</i><br>
<i>&gt;    when awakening is precisely what happens to the lap</i><br>
<i>&gt;    when standing up.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="4849qlink4">If there is no dreamer, there cannot be a dream.  If there is a 
dream, there must be a dreamer.  Likewise, awakening can occur 
only when someone is awakened.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="4849qlink5"><a href="4828.html#4842qlink5">&gt; J. On the other hand, if one does not possess a self, then no</a><br>
<i>&gt;    delusion can occur, either, for delusion requires a self</a> in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    order to have a subject to delude - a deludee, if you will.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B. But, once again, although there is no dreamer there is</i><br>
<i>&gt;    still dreaming; dreaming that the dream-state is reality</i><br>
<i>&gt;    requires only the dream just as the dance requires only</i><br>
<i>&gt;    dancing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Dreaming requires a dreamer just as dancing requires a dancer; 
Neither I nor anyone I know has ever seen one in the absence of 
the other.
<br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="4849qlink6"><a href="4828.html#4842qlink6">&gt; J. There must be a believer for a belief to occur, and a</a><br>
<i>&gt;    nonexistent belief cannot</a> be deluded</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B There must be a believer for a belief to occur to a believer,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    is tautological, like "Snow is white if and only if snow is</i><br>
<i>&gt;    white."</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
And tautologies are by necessity true.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="4828.html#4842qlink7">&gt; J. In addition, delusion in the absence of one who is indeed</a><br>
<i>&gt;    deluded makes no sense whatsoever, since such a concept</i><br>
<i>&gt;    cannot meet the sine qua non test.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B. Delusion is a property of consciousness that mistakes its</i><br>
<i>&gt;     reflexivity for a subject-object duality.  Delusion is then</i><br>
<i>&gt;     simply a state of the unawareness of consciousness of its</i><br>
<i>&gt;     own "true nature".</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
Perhaps the truly deluded self-consciousness is the one which is 
infected with the "I do not really exist" maya meme.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="4828.html#4842qlink8">&gt; J.  So, whether or not there is such an entity as a self in</a><br>
<i>&gt;     existence, there can be no delusion, and there is no</i><br>
<i>&gt;     room between the twin horns of this dilemma, since the</i><br>
<i>&gt;     either-or alternatives encompass all the possible situational</i><br>
<i>&gt;     alternatives. Q.E.D.,</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B. There is a disintegrated state of consciousness that can</i><br>
<i>&gt;     be called "delusion" or "ignorance", but there is no one</i><br>
<i>&gt;     who is deluded or ignorant. The eye cannot see itself</i><br>
<i>&gt;     seeing because there is nothing to see.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="4849qlink7">The eye cannot see itself, but its seeing refers necessarily to a 
seer as surely as it refers to a seen.</a>
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="4828.html#4842qlink9">&gt; J. The Zen Doctrine of No-Mind, which asserts that such a</a><br>
<i>&gt;    belief is necessarily deluded, when in fact it cannot be,</i><br>
<i>&gt;    must be false. There is a way around this argument.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B. You can continue dualistically thinking that the doctrine</i><br>
<i>&gt;     of No-Mind is false, as long as you continue to think</i><br>
<i>&gt;     dualistically.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="4849qlink8">The epithet of "dualistic" is a common Zen ploy with which its 
practitioners attempt to dismiss what they cannot refute.</a>  In this 
case, the dismissal fails also.
<br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="4828.html#4842qlink10">&gt; J.  Have fun,  Joe</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; B. All fun is Zen, Joe, because it makes you laugh!</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;       One monk said to the other, "The fish has</i><br>
<i>&gt;       flopped out of the net! How will it live?"</i><br>
<i>&gt;       The other said, "When you have gotten</i><br>
<i>&gt;       out of the net, I'll tell you."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="4849qlink9">There is a way around the conundrum, but you ain't found it yet.  I'll 
give you another chance; if you don't find it then, I'll go ahead and 
</a>tell you.
