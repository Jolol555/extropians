Seeing so called "auras" is an easy skill to teach.  The real question
is what exactly are you seeing once you spot it?  Is it a trick of
the cornea?  Is it ambient light that is being refracted through
body heated air?  Or is it some kind of energy field (like that
found Kirlain Photographs) yet to be explained by science?
I have no opinion.

<p>
But for those that are curious, seeing "aura's" can be self-taught
in as little as 15 minutes.  All you have to do is sit in front of
a mirror with a white background behind you. You want
to focus aprox ~ 2 -3 feet behind your head.  After
a few moments of focusing your eyes just behind your head,
you should begin to notice (somewhat indirectly) a faintly
colored light surrounding your body.  It is true, that this
"aura" can come in every color.  As to its authenticity or
New Age claim that its a predictor of your psyche, I remain
unconvinced.  Its too bad no one has done a study on this

of the eye or something else altogether.</a>
