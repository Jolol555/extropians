<a name="1186qlink1">Judging from the posts I've been seeing on certain threads recently, it 
looks like it is time to revisit this topic.  Old-timers who've had the 
debate a dozen times already may want to skip this thread.

<p>
The question at hand is this: "Given what we know about human history, 
human technology, and the nature of reality, how do we decide whether some 
novel idea about possible alien civilizations is plausible?"  Or, to put it 
another way, "What is and is not predictable about alien civilizations?"</a>

<p>
<a name="1215qlink1"><a name="1186qlink2">There are several big mental pitfalls that you have to avoid when 
approaching this subject.</a>  Most people manage to get stuck in at least one 
of them, and consequently never say anything that is even remotely 
plausible.  They are, in no particular order:

<p>
<a name="1222qlink1">Unrealistic Technology Expectations
</a><br>
This idea comes in two closely related forms: "Future technology will be 
just like current technology" and "Future technology will be just like old 
science fiction."  Wrong.  This kind of thinking leads you to ignore even 
old, modest technologies like robotics and genetic engineering.  If you 
want a realistic picture, you need to deal with the prospects for 
nanotechnology, AI, and superintelligence in a realistic manner.  If you 
are going to dismiss them, you need to explicity say so (and supplying a 
justification for doing so would also be a good idea).

<p>
Short Time Horizons
<br>
We aren't talking about a few hundred years of event here.  Or even</a> a few 
thousand, or a few tens of thousands.  Unless you think there is some 
special reason why technological civilizations have just now become 
possible, you need to deal with time spans of at least tens of millions of 
years.  This is one of the reasons why most of us don't find scenarios that 
include technological roadblocks or galactic Prime Directive treaties to be 
very plausible.

<p>
Insufficent Appreciation of the Effects of Diversity
AKA "maybe not everyone will want to invent nanotechnology".  It doesn't 
matter if 99.9999999% of all sentients spend all of eternity contemplating 
their navels.  If I had the technology of 100,000 years hence, you can be 
sure my personal projects would be visible from distant galaxies.  Simple 
evolutionary processes will give you a universe dominated by active 
explorers, even if almost everyone starts out being a homebody.  This means 
that if you want to hypothesize a universe full of advanced civilizations 
you need to think really, really hard about explaining why they haven't set 
up shop here.

<p>
Exaggerated Respect for the Immensity of Space
The galaxy is big, but it isn't infinite.  A single expansionist species 
with sublight travel could easily colonize every single system in it in 
less &lt;10^6 years.  Suggesting that we are surrounded by aliens, but they 
don't happen to have visited us, is equivalent to sugggesting that a 
particular lot on Manhatten Island might remain vacant for the next million 
years.

<p>
Exaggerated Sense of Mortality
<br>
AKA "maybe the aliens did thus-and-such, then died off..."  What exactly do 
you think could have killed them?  Most of the ideas I've heard wouldn't 
kill of modern-day humanity, let alone spacefaring aliens.  Remember, even 
without nanotechnology, a single surviving colony could repopulate an 
entire species in a very short amount of time (instantly, form a geological 
perspective).  If you use a realistic technology projection, and keep in 
mind that some small fraction of any population is going to be prepared for 
even fairly extreme emergencies, it is hard to imagine any event that could 
kill of a spacefaring species.  Certainly, any disaster that big isn't 
likely to leave any intact planets in the galaxy.
