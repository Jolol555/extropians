Reminds me of the cartoon "Over the Hedge". A character asks the Tree
That Knows Things: 


<UL>
  <li>  "Oh, Tree That Knows Stuff... so which is it? 'Nature' or 'Nurture'?"
  <li>  "We are not ruled by our genes..."
&lt;a speech bubble pops up from the character's tummy&gt;
  <li>  "Achtung baby!"
  <li>  "...we are *tyrannized* by our genes"
  <li>  "Ve have vays of making you *you*!"

I would say that this genetic view is however a bit limited, because
the interplay between the genes produces so much complexity. Sure, the
neurotransmittor receptor alleles I have influence my personality a
lot, but my personality is the result just of the interaction between
these genes and the environment. It is not something set in stone, it
can be modified quite a bit. Still, it is great fun to be able to
figure out just what causes our various motivations and quirks, the
more I understand of how I work, the better I think I become at using
what I am to achieve what I want.
