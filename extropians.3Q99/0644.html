Don't worry about hedging your bets - apparently you can just take it all
back at the last moment (repent), no matter what naughty things you have
been thinking (even, I presume, thinking about taking it all back).

<p>
The only obstacle to this approach is sudden death - the human equivalent of
the blue screen. What you need to plan for if you are worried about
damnation is a graceful shutdown (deathbed), so that you've got time to kick
off the Salvation OS bootstrap (ie: repent).

<p>
I wonder if cryo is good enough - do the believers (in God, not cryo) think
that the soul hangs around a cryo suspended person, or does it wander off to
limbo or some such thing? Or does it go somewhere excellent, so that we'll
find the first reanimated cryo subjects wake up and say "Where's the off
switch?"

Emlyn, who didn't really mean it big guy, really, (eep)
