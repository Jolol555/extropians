&lt;&lt;But seriously, when you make a segue of that magnitude, please change the subject line.  Or else try to maintain relevance to the topic; i.e. "And I think this demonstrates a disdain for all human beings that is the direct result of being an AI researcher, which is why I don't trust an AI Transcend.&gt;&gt;

<p>
Yes! :-)  And that is my point!  I have yet to meet a
serious 'hard' AI researcher who is not lacking in either
ethics or social skills.  So how can you possibly ask me to
trust the 'sons-a-bitches' to create a benevolent AI?</a>  The
<a name="1443qlink2">assholes can barely behave themselves in the most controlled
social settings, and you want me to hedge my bets and my
life in the hands of this lot?  Gimme a break!</a>

<a name="1525qlink2"><a name="1443qlink3">Eli, you want to create an SI before nanotech destroys
<a name="1525qlink3">everything.</a>  People like Den Otter, Max More and myself want
to IA ourselves to singularity before the SI's destroy us!</a></a>
<a name="1525qlink4"><a name="1443qlink4">What makes  you think you can close the gap between
assembler and SI any sooner than we can close the gap
between SI and uploading?</a>  You said it yourself - we are
fools to try to attempt to beat a 2020 CRNS technology with
2040 CRNS technology.  But how are you any less the fool to
try to beat a 2010 CRNS tech with a 2020 CRNS tech?  And I'm
using your CRNS estimates!</a>  :-)
