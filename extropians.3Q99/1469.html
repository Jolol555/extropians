<p>
I'll grant you that "not important" was a bit of an exaggeration, after all, with just a
small change in the helix geometry of DNA and guanine will be able to bind with thymine
and thus produce a mutation. However the sugar phosphate backbone is pretty robust,
on the other hand the purine and pyrimidines that make up the rungs are only held together
by weak hydrogen bonds, only about 5% as strong as a standard covalent bond.
Besides a direct mechanism radiation might also increase the concentration of rare
(one part in 10^5) tautomeric forms of the 4 bases allowing for example Cytosine to
pair up with Adenine instead of Guanine as it should.

<p>
The rungs are where the action is, even severe damage to the backbone could theoretically
be repaired, but destroy enough of the rungs and the information is simply gone, even
Nanotechnology couldn't bring it back. Just change GAG to GTG at a specific point in the part
of the DNA helix that codes for the Beta chain in hemoglobin and you have sickle cell anemia.
