Burt's data has been deleted from most of the literature because of his
systematic errors which look more to be the result of his arrogance than of
premeditated fraud.  Arthur Jensen goes over this in _Straight Talk About
Mental Tests_ (pp124-127) and offers the following conclusion, "the deletion
of Burt's empirical legacy would scarcely make an iota of difference to any
general conclusion regarding the heritability of intelligence, so much
greater is the body of more recent and better evidence."  This was written
in 1981.

<a name="2547qlink4">Now, this is not to say that non-hereditary factors have no impact,</a> but we
should _not_ adopt the syllogism:

<p>
    Cyril Burt's data is wrong.

    Cyril Burt's data supports the view that intelligence is inherited.
    Ergo, the view that intelligence is inherited is wrong.
