<p>
<a href="3272.html#3285qlink2">&gt; &gt;From http://meltingpot.fortunecity.com//kuwait/557/principles.html#sing</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&</a>gt;As AI (of the conscious kind) is one of the biggest liabilities, this</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; field of research should be monitored extra carefully, and curbed if necessary. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I see two possible problems:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1)  We're so busy trying to sabotage each other's efforts that we all</i><br>
<i>&gt; wind up getting eaten by goo / insane Powers.</i><br>
 
<p>
Let's hope we can somehow prevent that...

<p>
<a name="3292qlink2"><a href="3272.html#3285qlink3">&gt; 2)  Iraq gets nanotechnology instead of the US / the AI project has to</a><br>
<i>&gt; be run in secret and is not subject to public supervision and error correction.</i><br>
 
<p>
Note that "curbing" AI (or any other dangerous technology) by no means
has to involve government-imposed bans. There are other (better) ways to
do this.</a>

<p>
<a name="3292qlink3">Besides, do you really belief that the US military would ever drop their
nano/AI research projects because of some sissy civillian ban? They're
not *that* stupid. Not that such a ban would be likely to be imposed in
the first place; there's too much money riding on this.</a> No, scaring the
<a name="3292qlink4">public and the government would more likely result in a tightening of
project security, which is quite good because it would buy us some time.</a>

<p>
<a name="3292qlink5"><a href="3272.html#3285qlink4">&gt; "Trying to suppress a dangerous technology only inflicts more damage." </a><br>
<i>&gt; (Yudkowsky's Threats #2.)</i><br>

<p>
How defeatist. I'd say that suppressing the proliferation of nukes, for
example, was a *great* idea. Otherwise we probably wouldn't be here
right now. Stupid as they may be, big governments do offer fairly good
stability, on average.</a> 
 
<p>
<a href="3272.html#3285qlink5">&gt; I'm not sure - still running the numbers, and while I'm an idealist, I</a><br>
<i>&gt; don't trust my own idealism - but maybe "Nonsuppression" should be one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the Singularitarian Principles.  </i><br>

<p>
Surely you're not trying to monopolize the definition of
Singularitarianism? 

<p>
<a name="3292qlink6"><a href="3272.html#3285qlink6">&gt; Can anyone really think that ve can panic politicians or the media into</a><br>
<i>&gt; pushing for laws that suppress nanotech/AI without their noticing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; existence of AI/nanotech/uploading/neurohacking/genetic engineering? </i><br>
<i>&gt; You push for the "Nanotechnology Suppression Act" and you'll get the</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Comprehensive Ultratechnology Regulation Bill".</i><br>

<p>
So what? Laws can be broken, twisted, evaded. Like we were waiting for
the government's blessing in the first place.</a> 
 
<p>
<a name="3292qlink7"><a href="3272.html#3285qlink7">&gt; Who are the "Transtopians", anyway?  My guess is</a><br>
<i>&gt; den Otter.</i><br>

<p>
The writings are mine, obviously. Anyone who agrees with the principles
can call himself a "Transtopian". And yes, there are actually
like-minded people out there, strangely enough. Of course, as this is
the fringe of a fringe movement, you can't expect it to be very big.
