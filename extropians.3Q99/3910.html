OK, almost a week having gone by, I assume you're all zipped up, Robert.  
You're not "thinking outside the box", to use a term I saw you use here 
recently (and for which I've sent you a bill, having taxed my cliche 
tolerance :-) Seriously, the error you make in your narrative about the 
legendary (and largely mythic) "Old West" is in assuming that the progression 
from armed and brutal disorder to the use of law and well-defined and 
circumscribed agencies of force can only proceed through the pathway of 
statism.  While I'll concede it's pretty much a purely theoretical construct, 
some pretty bright people have worked out an alternative pathway that builds 
up these same values in a decentralized pathway that leads through 
consensual, contractual ceding of rights.  To see a brief description of this 
idea, take a look at David Friedman's "Law as a Private Good":

.html

<p>
I'm not trying to open a full-blown debate on privately produced law, but 
felt a pointer to Friedman was in order, since we've got a lot of new folks 
around.
