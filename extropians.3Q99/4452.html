<a name="4455qlink1">Robert, or anyone else who has information, please suggest how best to get
at at least one copy, and possibly numerous copies of Nanomedicine. I seem
to recall some suggestion about ordering it from the publisher instead of
Amazon (or from somewhere else?) so that Robert Freitas gets the maximum
royalites.

<p>
I especially want to get the book *soon* and perhaps multiple copies, since
I will be giving a talk on the future of medical practice at the Medicine
of the New Millennium conference. This will consist entirely of medical
professionals (includig three Nobel prize-winners) and will count as credit
by the AMA for continuing medical education. While my focus is on
philosophical issues, I certainly want to have read Nanomedicine by the
time of the conference in December, and perhaps give it some promotion. I
reviewed one of the early chapters and was impressed.

<p>
So, please suggest -- should I place an order at Amazon or B&amp;N, or with the
publisher (contact info needed), and when is it available.?

<p>
Thanks,

<p>
