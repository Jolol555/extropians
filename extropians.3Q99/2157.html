<a name="2183qlink1">Actually, it doesn't surprise me.  Remember, this is the guy who ended his 
presidency with a chilling speech in which he warned the American people 
about the extent to which "the military-industrial complex" (a term he used 
in the speech) was preempting the formation of public policy by democratic 
institutions.  He also oversaw the largest reductions in military force</a> in US 
<a name="2183qlink2">history, even though ten years before he had organized and led the largest 
high-tech (for its day) military operation in history (with what was, under 
the circumstances, an amazingly small number of casualties).  Along</a> the way, 
<a name="2183qlink3">by his candidacy, he blocked Douglas MacArthur's bid for the presidency, a 
turn of good fortune the value of which it is hard to calculate, but is 
almost surely a very, very good thing.  He was by no means perfect, but in 
many ways, Eisenhower lived up to the ideal of Cincinnatus we were talking 
about a while ago.</a>
