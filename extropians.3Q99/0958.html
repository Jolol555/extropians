<a name="0979qlink1">When I look at the angles in the so-called "City" complex, the proximity of 
the "Face," the redundancy of the "Cliff" feature, which mirrors similar 
features on the "Face" when viewed from the surface, the surreal cork-screw 
effect of the "Tholus" to the direct bottom of the "Cliff," the identical 
faceted compositions of the "Main Pyramid" and the "D&amp;M Pyramid," apparent 
buttressing, lack of impact damage (suggesting an origin more recent than the 
craters in question), the fine detail evident in the "Face," the linear 
arrays of knobs atop Hecates Tholus, the Cydonia Quadrangle, signs of 
possible excacation, unidentified dark material emerging from a seeming 
"crack" in the "D&amp;M's" northern facet, etc., etc., I'm satisfied that there 
is something most definitely worth looking into.

If this is an architecture, it wasn't built by us and it's very, very old.  
<a name="0979qlink2">It's interesting that you don't think it's prudent to "waste money" (a 
myth--we've already got a craft there ready to take pictures without costing 
</a>anything) on taking a better look at structures "only a blind person sees," 
since some of the more intriguing archaeological finds right here on Earth 
have been made by satellites that reveal structure the human eye can't make 
out.

We're talking _at least_ thirty thousand years of Martian weathering.  Of 
course artificial structures on Mars aren't going to jump out like, say, a 
picture of New York City from a few thousand feet.  We can rightly expect the 
confirming details to be subtle.

<p>
Carl Sagan noted that the presence of intelligence on Earth is revealed by 
the _geometric_ aspect of its constructions.  There are enough geometric 
anomalies in the Cydonia region, and elsewhere on Mars, that seem to fulfill 
this criteria.  As such, they deserve close scrutiny and objectivity.

<p>
What were you expecting?  The Chrysler building?  Chrome and glass and 
satellite dishes?  Another point: if the formations on Mars are artificial, 
they were probably built as self-contained structures; the enviroment on Mars 
hasn't been too hospitable of late.  So looking for urban sprawl and so forth 
might be too anthrocentric an approach.
