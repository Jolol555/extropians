<p>
I managed to get a few memes injected into the ABC chat site
on the Brave New World / SETI discussion.

<p>
URL: <a href="http://chat.abcnews.go.com/chat/chat.dll?room=nightline990903">http://chat.abcnews.go.com/chat/chat.dll?room=nightline990903</a>

<p>
They posted 2 of my 4 questions (there would have been more but
I came in in the middle).  I managed to stack the deck by making
one of the questions self-reference the ABC BNW eposide about
uploading.

<p>
The 2 questions that didn't make it were those pointing out
problems with current SETI strategies (such as looking at
visible "stars" instead of Dyson spheres and the problem that
advanced civilizations are going to send highly focused
communication beams to "beings" worth communicating with
<br>
(and so we wouldn't see them unless we were in the "line-of-sight").<br>
I guess I'm not surprised...

<p>
It may be that ABC is having a chat (on Fri.) after every
BNW episode (Thur. nights), it would seem to make sense for
as many of us as possible to participate in these.  :-&gt;&gt;

<p>
Enjoy,
<br>
Robert
