I'm not sure what you mean by this, but since it was written in response to
my posting, I can only assume it is addressed to me.
<br>

<a href="4622.html#4623qlink2">&gt;Backdrop is important. Backdrop of Life. Life as theater. Theater as impact. </a><br>
<i>&gt;Impact as vision. Vision as passion. Passion as impetus. Impetus as drive. </i><br>
<i>&gt;Drive as Force. Force as movement. Movement. Go. Accelerate. New. </i><br>

<p>
Actually, I agree with that.  What I was trying to express, in my own poor
fashion, is that the backdrop is generally ignored by the persons who go to
the club, at least to the many ones I have been to.  

<p>
<a href="4622.html#4623qlink3">&gt;People *are* affected by architecture, design and decor,  including smells, </a><br>

air 
<br>
<a href="4622.html#4623qlink4">&gt;of a new city and finding out what it has ti offer.</a><br>

<p>
I also agree with that.  I enjoy clubs, museums, art installations,
gardens--any environment that allows you to step out of yourself and move
into other mental spaces.  I was trying to express my own frustration that
so many people do not take advantage of that, that they just use these
places as backdrops, not to appreciate them.  Sorry if that did not come
through.

<p>
Okay, well, this is beginning to sound a bit personal.  People who know me
will tell you that I am a very playful person, that I consider it very
important as personal growth, and that I am always trying to drag members
of the local DC group out to have some fun!<a name="4632qlink1">  Arjen Kamphuis gave</a> a
wonderful speech at the first Transvision about pushing human limits
through playful experiences, and that touched me deeply.  

<p>
<a name="4632qlink2">I hope that in the future you will get to know me better, and that maybe</a> we
can go out and have some fun together.  

<p>
Take care, and have a wonderful day,
