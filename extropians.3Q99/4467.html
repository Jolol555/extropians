Ja.  I can support your contention that violence is a way of conveying
information.  That mysterious reptilian lowbrow bioware in my brain that
experiences a strangely pleasant endorphine feedback from a good
evenly-matched contest of fisticuffs is stimulated just as effectively with
a videotaped match as with a live one.  In fact, perhaps the videotape
is superior, for then one need not suffer the possible guilt feelings
for actually enjoying witnessing a couple of galoots bash each other
senseless, knowing that by patronizing such a sport, one is actually
encouraging these behaviours.  Besides, the matches that are videotaped
and archived are those in which the contestants *were* evenly matched
and enthusiastic.

<p>
Where I wanted to go with this notion is that our human natures do have
a darker side, and perhaps we as extropians have not fully dealt with
the fact.  At least I have not.  Boxing is about as unextropian as can be
imagined, for there is good evidence that brain damage results from a
long career in this particular sport, which is likely unrepairable.
