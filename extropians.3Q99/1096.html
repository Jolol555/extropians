Yes, the MGS didn't get anything new.  I haven't seen a particularly good 
enhancement yet--or maybe it's just my computer--but it is definitely a 
closer view than the April image.  Honestly, I'm not sure why NASA bothered 
with this region again...they've proclaimed disinterest (at the same time 
publicly claiming that the region would be rephotographed until, and I quote 
Dan Goldin "everyone is satisfied.")

<p>
My best guess would the prospect of water ice north of the Main Pyramid.  I'd 
_like_ to think they were aiming at the Fort, since I think it's more liable 
to tell us something re. possible artificiality than the Face.

<p>
Let's wait and see.
