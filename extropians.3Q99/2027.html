Well said, Joe!   Hell, I (and I 'm sure most others in this e-mail 
chat-group) qualify for Mensa with my frickin' SAT scores alone (and, so 
I've been informed, also qualify for that group of "super-intelligent" [n.b. 
the scare quotation marks!!] "Mensa within Mensa", whose exact name I can't 
recall).  I mean, hell, I'm sure good ol'*wunderkindt* Yudkowsky so 
qualifies (said with deep respect, Eleizer);  but *I'd* MUCH rather attend a 
libertarian and/or Extropian get-together or convention than go to a Mensa 
get-together---though it should be noted that oftentimes these groups 
overlap and are co-extensive to a significant degree.

<p>
I think it was Darin, in his brief dissertation on the history of the 
<br>
*Stanford*-Binet stuff that hit the nail on the head.  BTW, for general <br>
discussions of multifaceted intelligence, check out Howard Gardner (of 
Harvard) stuff and Sternberg (can't recall his first name)  (of Yale) stuff. 
  They've each written several books and articles attempting to 
systematically expand/revise the notion(s)/criteria of "intelligence".

<p>
Have a great weekend, y'all!  Ciao!
