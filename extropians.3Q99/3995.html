Ah yes, lets give the teachers guns so they can defend themselves

Now here, Michael does take up an interesting point.  Reviewing an
old post involving how to  "Own your Name" using the uniform commercial
code (a very complex post to be sure), I did some investigation into
citizenship.  Two things seem to be true:
  (a) That children when they "Pledge alliegence to the flag of the
<pre>
      United States of America" clearly have no understanding of what
      this *really* means [so it is brainwashing].</a>
<a name="4055qlink3">  (b) U.S. Citizens appear to be free to "renounce" citizenship
      at any time to a "representative" (Judge/Immigration officer?)
      of the United States.

</pre>
<p>
Two questions arise.
<br>
  (1) Has (a) ever been tested under the kind of "informed consent"
<p>
      principles that govern medical procedures.
  (2) If you execute (b), and become a stateless citizen, are you
<pre>
      still able to legally work in the U.S. (or must you obtain
      a Green Card)?</a>

</pre>
<p>
<a name="4055qlink4">Then of course, the question for all the "Libertarians" out there
is, if you object to government so much, why haven't you executed
plan (b)?  If you were to execute (b), is there a country that
is preferable to declare oneself a citizen</a> of?

<p>
Mind you, I can think of one direct benefit of citizenship which is
that the country will extract or defend you from circumstances
which are highly hazardous in foreign countries.
