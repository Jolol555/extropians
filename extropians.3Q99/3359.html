<i>&gt; MRI is being used to map out the wiring between different parts of the brain.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Notable quotation: "We were surprised and excited to find that the brain</i><br>
<i>&gt; circuitry was wired in such an orderly fashion."</i><br>

<p>
It is a beautiful article, and shows that MRI is extremely
versatile. I disagree with the quoted researcher about the surprise;
all anatomical data suggest that fiber tracts are neatly ordered, they
just look tangled under a microscope. It would be much more surprising
if the tracts were random.

<p>
<a href="3280.html#3359qlink2">&gt; This led to a tangential thought: others have often said that a super-AI could</a><br>
<i>&gt; convince any human guardians it wasn't malevolent and was safe out of its</i><br>
<i>&gt; sandbox, even if it was wholly paranoid and malevolent.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; How is that supposed to work if the humans can read the AI's thoughts?  If even</i><br>
<i>&gt; the evolved brains of humans are relatively modular and well-wired, I think a</i><br>
<i>&gt; well-built software program will be fairly transparent.  </i><br>

<a name="3375qlink1">Unfortunately, this is not necessarily true. If I see a complex
pattern of activity in your brain, I cannot tell if it is you thinking
of strawberries or killing me, despite the orderliness of the
long-range connections. What individual neurons represent is likely
highly variable, and hence a pattern of activity that might in one
brain correspond to murder would in another be strawberries.</a>

<p>
<a href="3280.html#3359qlink3">&gt; Not that I subscribe to any belief that AIs will necessarily have any</a><br>
<i>&gt; particular property, although I'd hope being able to examine their own source</i><br>
<i>&gt; code would at least mess with any religion they pick up.  (Not to mention the</i><br>
<i>&gt; agelessness, backup, and duplication issues.)</i><br>
