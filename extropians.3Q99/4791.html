<a name="4799qlink1">I received the following on another mailing list.  I've signed it and am 
passing it on here because I believe it serves a very extropic cause:


<UL>

</UL>
<p>
The government of Afghanistan is waging a war upon women. Since the
Taliban took power in 1996, women have had to wear burqua and have been
beaten and stoned in public for not having the proper attire, even if
this means simply not having the mesh covering in front of their eyes.

<p>
One woman was beaten to DEATH by an angry mob of fundamentalists for
accidentally exposing her arm while she was driving. Another was stoned
to death for trying to leave the country with a man that was not a
relative. Women are not allowed to work or even go out in public without
a male relative; professional women such as professors, translators,
doctors, lawyers, artists and writers have been forced from their jobs
and stuffed into their homes, so that depression is becoming</a> so
widespread that it has reached emergency levels.

<p>
There no way in such an extreme Islamic society to know the suicide rate
with certainty, but relief workers are estimating that the suicide rate
among women, who cannot find proper medication and treatment for severe
depression and would rather take their lives than live in such
conditions, has increased significantly.

<p>
Homes where a woman is present must have their windows painted so that
she can never be seen by outsiders. They must wear silent shoes so that
they are never heard. Women live in fear of their lives for the
slightest misbehaviour. Because they cannot work, those without male 
relatives or
<br>
husbands are either starving to death or begging on the street, even if
they hold Ph.D.'s.

<p>
There are almost no medical facilities available for women, and relief
workers, in protest, have mostly left the country, taking medicine and
psychologists and other things necessary to treat the sky-rocketing
level of depression among women. At one of the rare hospitals for women,
a reporter found still, nearly lifeless bodies lying motionless on top
of beds, wrapped in their burqua, unwilling to speak, eat, or do
anything, but slowly wasting away. Others have gone mad and were seen 
crouched in corners, perpetually rocking or crying, most of them in fear. One 
doctor
<br>
<a name="4799qlink2">is considering, when what little medication that is left finally runs
out, leaving these women in front of the president's residence as a form
of peaceful protest.

<p>
It is at the point where the term 'human rights violations' has become
an understatement. Husbands have the power of life and death over their
women relatives, especially their wives, but an angry mob has just as
much right to stone or beat a woman, often to death, for exposing an
inch of flesh or offending them in the slightest way. Women enjoyed
relative freedom, to work, dress generally as they wanted, and drive and 
appear
<br>
in public alone until only 1996. The rapidity of this transition is the
main reason for the depression and suicide; women who were once educators or
doctors or simply used to basic human freedoms are now severely
restricted and treated as sub-human in the name of right-wing
fundamentalist Islam. It is not their tradition or 'culture', but</a> is alien to 
them, and
<br>
<a name="4799qlink3">it is extreme even for those cultures where fundamentalism is the rule.

<p>
Everyone has a right to a tolerable human existence, even if they are
women in a Muslim country. If we can threaten military force in Kosovo
in the name of human rights for the sake of ethnic Albanians, citizens
of the world can certainly express peaceful outrage at the oppression,
murder and injustice committed against women by the Taliban.


<p>
STATEMENT: In signing this, we agree that the current treatment of women
in Afghanistan is completely UNACCEPTABLE and deserves support and
action by the United Nations and that the current situation overseas
will not be tolerated. Women's Rights is not a small issue anywhere and
it is UNACCEPTABLE for women in 1999 to be treated as sub-human and so much
as property. Equality and human decency is a RIGHT not a freedom, whether
one lives in Afghanistan or elsewhere.
