<p>
well as the saying goes being bisexual doubles your chances of getting a hot
date on Saturday night ...

<p>
I doubt if sexuality can be reprogrammed but there are a lot of individuals
who can function well with either gender and/or are sexually confused
although that apparently does cause most of them any distress at all!

<p>
Some time ago I did a study of sexual personality and motivation. The
original conference paper was lost but parts of it have been spliced
together from old ditto masters and placed on the web. If anyone is
interested the URL for the paper and associated graphic is:
