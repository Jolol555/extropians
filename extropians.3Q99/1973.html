I'm still fairly skeptical of this project.  Comparing the size of this 
vessel to MAJOR marine construction projects I've been involved with, it 
seems like this construction would cost AT LEAST a billion dollars.  It would 
be THE shipbuilding project of the decade, at least.  I don't see the names 
of any of the major shipbuilding firms being advertised as associated with 
the project.  (Of course, Daewoo and Hyundai might offer cut-rate prices 
these days, but you're still looking at high nine figures to get this thing 
launched.)  And this doesn't address the basic design issues I've mentioned 
before: It seems like a multi-hull design would be right for a vessel of this 
size, rather than the "big canoe" layout that's depicted at the website . . .
