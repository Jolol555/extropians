<p>
No problem with this.

 Some of them?  Quite probably.  But _all_ of them?</a>  I can't make this leap

<a href="1032.html#1055qlink6">&gt;They do not "die off".  They do not land, poke around in self-contained</a><br>

<p>
Too much supposition.  The star-faring culture could have easily "blasted 
off" from a point of technological development _much_ more primitive than the 
situation you describe.  Generation arcs and the like may be too "science 
fiction" for you, but just because they're not stylish anymore among the 
likes of certain Extropians doesn't render the concept obsolete (or even 
suspect).

Couldn't resist, could you?
