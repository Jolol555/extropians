There is a bit of truth to this, but I would prefer to use descriptive
phrases as follows:

<p>
During nonfertile period, women gravitate toward "individuals who are
capable of intelligent conversation" and during ovulation women crave
"individuals who are visually stimulating."

<p>
Sorry, no.  What would mostly likely occur would be that women go for the
individual who is intellectually stimulating as well as physically
appealing.  These individuals would get the most sex.  

<p>
<i>&gt;Since our society has invented</i><br>

<i>&gt;women to visit Mr. Buns during the fertile few days, it seems</i><br>

<i>&gt;favor of Mr. Brains.  Right? </i><br>

<p>
Sorry, no again.  It is not that clear cut.  Not everyone who has brains is
unaesthetic.  In fact, there are many brainy men who are quite handsome and
stylish.  The odds would be in favor of this individual over someone who is
simply smart and stinky.

<p>
<i>&gt;Does this explain why humans</i><br>
<a href="0781.html#0806qlink4">&gt;are getting more intelligent over the past few millenia?  spike</a><br>

<p>
If people are getting more intelligent it is because of better nutrition,
more stimulation (visual perhaps), and more tools and a few lucky genes.
