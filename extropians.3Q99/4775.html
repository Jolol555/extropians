Altering and enhancing physical space can be exotically achieved by light
and color.  A really wonderful example was produced by Robert Trumbell
<br>
(sp?) where he took a rectangular room -- white walls and ceiling-- and<br>
created an illusion of several layers of walls at different heights and
distances from each other.  But, when walking up to the surfaces and
touching them, there was only one wall and it was totally flat.   He
created this 3D perspective illusion by lights and subtle colors alone.

<p>
Goethe also played with space and color by steering his guest through rooms
of his home by colors, as if drawing the guest throughout the room by
alluring colors.

<p>
Conceptualizing possible landscapes and structures for the future would
have to be multiple-reality based.  How one structure interfaces with
another structure in a different reality could require a sort of transition
vestibule entry stage that could be really enticing.  Going from a solid
state environment to a liquid state environment, or morphing from a
transbiological entity to a synthetic entity might make for surrealistic
surfaces and dimensions.

<p>
Marcos Novak illustrates in Liquid Architecture in Cyberspace that there is
a great overlapping of these three seemingly disparate categories of
poetry, architecture and cyberspace: 

<p>
In defining liquid architecture, Novak states, "I use the liquid to mean
animistic, animated, metamorphic, as well as crossing categorical
boundaries, applying the cognitively supercharged operations of poetic
thinking... a liquid architecture in cyberspace is clearly a dematerialized
architecture."

Computer generated graphics in architecture. The graphics and text are a
brief of my study of the Piazza SS. Annunziata in Florence, Italy. Focus,
of the study, was on the relationship between architecture and the city, or
in more general terms, between an object and its environment

Artists, have the possibility of making culture. "Like artists, architects
should strive to be slightly ahead of everybody else, so they can focus
attention on what's happening. I don't mean we can impose an idea on
people. But if the building and the Center can remain fresh, unpredictable,
forward-looking - contemporary - then we will have succeeded."  Zaha Had,
architect, The Contemporary Arts Center
