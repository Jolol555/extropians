<p>
A transhumanist-friendly person has just taken responsibility for a portion of the Washington Post web site, and he is producing a chat series about technology.

<p>
I've already committed to being a regular guest on this series, on which I will discuss computer-mediated communications in the business context, based on a series I wrote for CanadaOne business magazine last year.

<p>
He is definitely going to need other guests, people who can talk about technology in ways that relate to everyday life, as well as people who can make advanced technologies understandable and relate well to the general public.

<p>
Let's help him out!  If you think you have the qualifications for this, please send along a bio to me so that I can make some suggestions to him for other guests.

<p>
