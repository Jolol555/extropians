Evolver16@aol.com asked:

<p>
<a href="3138.html#3181qlink1">&gt;   1.  In any way does cryonics provide the same sort of psychological</a><br>
<i>&gt; comfort that religion provides for some people?</i><br>

<p>
	It provides more comfort to me than any religion I know of
offers.

<p>
&gt; Have you just replaced heaven with the future?<br>

<p>
	Yes, and the future looks infinitely better than any heaven
I've heard offered in any religion.

<p>
<a href="3142.html#3181qlink2">&gt; The future is largley unlinked to heaven in a scientific world. The</a><br>
<i>&gt; concept is immortality, or at least a largely expanded life.</i><br>
<i>&gt;     The truth is, the future will be more like hell if some things</i><br>
<i>&gt; happen. We will wake up completely unprepared for the onslaught of</i><br>
<i>&gt; technology. We may well go insane.</i><br>

<p>
	Figuring out how to help people not go insane would be a
completely trivial task compared to the dificulting of acheiving
immortality and other things we might want to do to create the most
perfect possible heaven.


<p>
<a href="3142.html#3181qlink3">&gt; 2.  Since you plan to live forever, what are your long term goals?</a><br>

<p>
<a href="3142.html#3181qlink4">&gt; Long term goals? See the universe. Bask in the glow of a foreign</a><br>
<i>&gt; star. Have dinner wive my descendents and tell them of the barbaric</i><br>
<i>&gt; 20th century when compared the the 44th century or whatever.</i><br>

<p>
	Those would all be fun!  But the goal is to solve all problems
or eliminate all evil so to speek.  In other words, If we don't yet
have a heaven more perfect than any heaven offered by any religion, we
simply have more work to do.  How long do you think it will take to
figure out how to or descover a way to resurrect everyone that has
died?  Surely we might be able to finally do things like this after
working at it for 5 billions years or more?
