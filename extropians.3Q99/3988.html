Frankly I don't know, and what worries me most is that most teachers are
<a name="3995qlink1">women, which is why the schools are all gun free zones these days (they
didn't used to be), and why there is so much crap about political
</a>
correctness, PC speech and behavior, etc.<a name="4081qlink1"> I've always found it odd that
immigrants have to take a course on American History,</a> the Constituion,
and how our government works before you get your citizenship, but I
doubt that more than 50% of high schools in the country still offer the
same coursework, so naturally born kids never learn this stuff... I say
have a standardized nationwide test that all Americans have to take to
earn the right to vote, etc.<a name="3995qlink2"> You should only be a citizen if you
actually know, understand, and ACCEPT the values and mechanisms by which
our government operates. Take the same vow to "protect and defend the
Constitution of the United States from all enemies, foreign AND
domestic," that immigrants and military officers and enlistees take.</a>
