Clearly true.  The Msofties are always writing for the next generation
and thats why they can get away with being so sloppy.

That is also why Intel is so concerned that the hardware may get to the
point that it effectively runs most software, that they are providing
capital to companies to invent more things to suck up CPU cycles.
I can't wait until my computer can record those few TV shows I
think are worth watching and carefully edit out the commercials...

<a name="0345qlink1">I hate to tell you this, but Windows 2000 Beta 3, runs quite nicely

processors have already caught up with the software and applications.
The only thing driving stuff forward at this point are things like
games, DVD, DigitalTV and the really silly stuff like SETI@home
or cracking encryption codes that someone already knows the answer for.
