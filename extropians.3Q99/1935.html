<i>&gt; &gt; But, can't you see, thats the same problem--- SAT measures spatial</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; reasoning/math reasoning, and verbal ---   How about Mensa including </i><br>
<i>&gt;other</i><br>
<i>&gt;IQ</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; criterion (kinesthetics, athleticism, music, social IQ, or EQ)?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Is there some kind of standardized EQ test?  If so, has it been found to</i><br>
<i>&gt;actually be predictive for a person's social success?  For example, do</i><br>
<i>&gt;people with higher EQ report higher average levels of happiness, or have</i><br>
<i>&gt;fewer divorces?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;If all the the EQ tests look like the one below, then it would be pretty</i><br>
<i>&gt;easy for someone with a high IQ to score well on this test, even if they </i><br>
<i>&gt;had</i><br>
<i>&gt;no social skills at all:</i><br>

There are causes and effects in the social as well as the natural world.  
Everything behaves according to its nature, and when you find the original 
source for an institution, then you can pretty well guess what direction its 
future will take.

<p>
In the case of Mensa, the original source included Cyril Burt, who probably 
caused as much damage world-wide as Hitler.  After Burt's death in the late 
'70's, it was discovered that his claim to fame - the famous twin studies 
that seemed to prove that intelligence was largely genetic - was fudged to 
get the politically correct (and personally valuable) result that Burt 
wanted.  They found the original data in shoe boxes.

<p>
Burt became the leading light of British Commonwealth education on the basis 
of that study.  The entire Commonwealth - and much of the rest of the world 
- set up educational tracking based on his falsified results.  Montessori 
and all the other sources that appeared to show that intelligence could be 
vastly improved with the proper early childhood environment were 
"scientifically discredited."

<p>
It was not until the mass of evidence from the U. of Chicago - which 
resulted in Head Start and validated Piaget and Montessori - demonstrated 
the real importance of early childhood that education finally began to 
recover from Burt's fraud.  His fraud makes Lysenko look like a piker.  
There is no instance of a scientific fraud that even comes within two orders 
of magnitude of Burt's, in terms of real world impact.

<p>
Yet Mensa has yet to repudiate Burt....  Why?  Because the elitist 
do-nothings that make up the majority of Mensans - based on years of casual 
observation on my part, plus anecdotal testimony - are exactly the outcome 
you get when you have that kind of founding influence!  For them to 
repudiate their source would take exactly the kind of intellectual integrity 
that they overwhelmingly lacked.
