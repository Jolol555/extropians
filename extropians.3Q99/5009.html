<a name="5039qlink1">Most of the selection pressure on the shapes of the flowers humans
tend to select as beautiful results from the need to attract
insects for pollination.  In some cases, flowers go so far as to
mimic insects in mating postures and release bee sex pheromones
so as to more effectively exchange pollen with insects.  Maybe
we just happen to have more tastes in common with bees than we
thought; what the bee sees as sexy, we see as pretty.

I'm already confused though. Now we are talking about sexual
selection operating among several different kinds of species.
Three, in this case.
