Of course, if Michael is correct, it's item (d) that's the kickeressentially
 everyone in America has one or more accounts in
federally insured institutions.  Where o where can can I get a
non-FDIC account?

I betcha all credit unions, savings &amp; loans, banks, etc are required
to have federal insurance to be licensed, and without a license
they'd get raided and shut down in a heartbeat- so there's your
catch-22.
