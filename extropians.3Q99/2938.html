<i>&gt; Teach Your Children Well </i><br>
<i>&gt; by Joseph Sobran</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; [Posted August 23, 1999]</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Because I write about politics, people are forever</i><br>
<i>&gt; asking me the best way to teach children how our</i><br>
<i>&gt; system of government works. I tell them that they can</i><br>
<i>&gt; give their own children a basic civics course right in</i><br>
<i>&gt; their own homes.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; In my own experience as a father, I have discovered</i><br>
<i>&gt; several simple devices that can illustrate to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; child's mind the principles on which the modern state</i><br>
<i>&gt; deals with its citizens. You may find them helpful,</i><br>
<i>&gt; too.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; For example, I used to play the simple card game WAR</i><br>
<i>&gt; with my son. After a while, when he thoroughly</i><br>
<i>&gt; understood that the higher ranking cards beat the</i><br>
<i>&gt; lower ranking ones, I created a new game I called</i><br>
<i>&gt; GOVERNMENT. In this game, I was Government, and I won</i><br>
<i>&gt; every trick, regardless of who had the better card. My</i><br>
<i>&gt; boy soon lost interest in my new game, but I like to</i><br>
<i>&gt; think it taught him a valuable lesson for later in</i><br>
<i>&gt; life.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When your child is a little older, you can teach him</i><br>
<i>&gt; about our tax system in a way that is easy to grasp.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Offer him, say, $10 to mow the lawn. When he has mowed</i><br>
<i>&gt; it and asks to be paid, withhold $5 and explain that</i><br>
<i>&gt; this is income tax. Give $1 to his younger brother,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and tell him that this is "fair". Also, explain that</i><br>
<i>&gt; you need the other $4 yourself to cover the</i><br>
<i>&gt; administrative costs of dividing the money. When he</i><br>
<i>&gt; cries, tell him he is being "selfish" and "greedy".</i><br>
<i>&gt; Later in life he will thank you.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Make as many rules as possible. Leave the reasons for</i><br>
<i>&gt; them obscure. Enforce them arbitrarily. Accuse your</i><br>
<i>&gt; child of breaking rules you have never told him about.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Keep him anxious that he may be violating commands you</i><br>
<i>&gt; haven't yet issued. Instill in him the feeling that</i><br>
<i>&gt; rules are utterly irrational. This will prepare him</i><br>
<i>&gt; for living under democratic government.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; When your child has matured sufficiently to understand</i><br>
<i>&gt; how the judicial system works, set a bedtime for him</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then send him to bed an hour early. When he</i><br>
<i>&gt; tearfully accuses you of breaking the rules, explain</i><br>
<i>&gt; that you made the rules and you can interpret them in</i><br>
<i>&gt; any way that seems appropriate to you, according to</i><br>
<i>&gt; changing conditions. This will prepare him for the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Supreme Court's concept of the U.S. Constitution as a</i><br>
<i>&gt; "living document".</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Promise often to take him to the movies or the zoo,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and then, at the appointed hour, recline in an easy</i><br>
<i>&gt; chair with a newspaper and tell him you have changed</i><br>
<i>&gt; your plans. When he screams, "But you promised!",</i><br>
<i>&gt; explain to him that it was a campaign promise.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Every now and then, without warning, slap your child.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Then explain that this is defense. Tell him that you</i><br>
<i>&gt; must be vigilant at all times to stop any potential</i><br>
<i>&gt; enemy before he gets big enough to hurt you. This,</i><br>
<i>&gt; too, your child will appreciate, not right at that</i><br>
<i>&gt; moment, maybe, but later in life. </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; At times your child will naturally express discontent</i><br>
<i>&gt; with your methods. He may even give voice to a</i><br>
<i>&gt; petulant wish that he lived with another family. To</i><br>
<i>&gt; forestall and minimize this reaction, tell him how</i><br>
<i>&gt; lucky he is to be with you the most loving and</i><br>
<i>&gt; indulgent parent in the world, and recount lurid</i><br>
<i>&gt; stories of the cruelties of other parents. This will</i><br>
<i>&gt; make him loyal to you and, later, receptive to</i><br>
<i>&gt; schoolroom claims that the America of the postmodern</i><br>
<i>&gt; welfare state is still the best and freest country on</i><br>
<i>&gt; Earth.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; This brings me to the most important child-rearing</i><br>
<i>&gt; technique of all: lying. Lie to your child constantly.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Teach him that words mean nothing--or rather that the</i><br>
<i>&gt; meanings of words are continually "evolving", and may</i><br>
<i>&gt; be tomorrow the opposite of what they are today.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Some readers may object that this is a poor way to</i><br>
<i>&gt; raise a child. A few may even call it child abuse. But</i><br>
<i>&gt; that's the whole point: Child abuse is the best</i><br>
<i>&gt; preparation for adult life under our form of</i><br>
<i>&gt; GOVERNMENT. </i><br>
