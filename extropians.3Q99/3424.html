With all due respect: a machine will never be 'better' than a human chess

Deep Blue's feat, along with the general progress of chess computing
throughout the last 2 decades deeply changed the way chess players
view the act of playing chess.  It is interesting in retrospect to read
Bobby Fischer's comments about computer chess.  As far back as
the mid 70s,  he warned: the computers are coming.  They will be strong
opponents, even for grandmasters.  He was ridiculed at the time, but
of course he was right.

<p>
Now chess players have come to realize that their brains are running
an algorithm of some kind; perhaps not well understood, but still
an algorithm.  Today chess players in general will tend to be very
comfortable with the notion that computers will eventually [probably
soon] be able to do things that we think of as exclusively human,
such as driving cars, recognizing a face in a crowd, developing software,
writing poetry and music, and even playing chess *and enjoying it*.
