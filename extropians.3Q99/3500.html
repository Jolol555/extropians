I believe Adolph didn't employ biologicals, because, although some work was 
being done in devastating plagues, German intelligence (abwehr) had confirmed 
a UK-Canada-USA-Aussie "leadership" in this area. The Nazis did have a great 
lead in chemical weapons, however, and had developed  Nerve  agents, between 
1936-1939 at I.G. Farben ( a company which had been stolen from its Jewish 
owner in 1934). The chemicals are the gases/agents were soman, tabun, and 
sarin. I believe, the nazis were terrified of reprisals, especially by 
Britain. 

<p>
 Saddam Hussein also had to be concerned about Israeli strikes, if he used 
bio or chem agents. He was well-aware, it appears, that  the Israelis would 
not simply be content with sending the Republican Guard packing; as the USA 
was in 1991. 

<p>
Conclusion: Even the bloodthirsty/crazzies fear "un-acceptable dammages" that 
would un-ravel their rule. They may not know reason; but they understand pain.
