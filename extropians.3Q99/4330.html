Well, the best way to critisize something you can't logically critisize is
to throw in things entirely unrelated to the topic.  We've been through
this all with the attempts to critisize nanotechnology.

<pre>
&gt; 
&gt; It's not a matter of math.  If population is determined by reproduction,
&gt; it keeps expanding and expanding with no end in sight.  If population is
&gt; determined by carrying capacity, it stops at the same number of
&gt; long-lived humans as short-lived ones.  You're quite right, it doesn't sequit.
&gt; 

</pre>
<p>
I've been dealing with the population question for years, since it
is the first thing people come up with when you say we are going to
extend the human lifespan.

<p>
I'll just throw out some thoughts on the topic.

<p>
<a name="4362qlink1">This *isn't* news.  Going back to Malthus and probably before there
have always been concerns about this.

<p>
Dyson's 1960 paper that invented Dyson Shells pointed out the problem:</a>
<br>
<i>|  The material factors which ultimately limit the expansion of a</i><br>
<i>|  technically advanced species are the supply of matter and the</i><br>
<i>|  supply of energy. At present the material resources being exploited</i><br>
<i>|  by the human species are roughly limited to the biosphere of the earth,</i><br>
<i>|  a mass of the order of 5x10^19 grams.  Our present energy supply</i><br>
<i>|  may be generously estimated at 10^20 ergs per second. The quantities</i><br>
<i>|  of matter and energy which might conceivably become accessible to us</i><br>
|  within the solar system are 2x10^30 grams (the mass of Jupiter) and<br>
|  4x10^33 ergs per second (the total energy output of the sun). <br>
<pre>
|
</pre>
<br>
<i>|  The reader may well ask in what sense can anyone speak of the mass of</i><br>
<i>|  Jupiter or the total radiation from the sun as being accessible to</i><br>
<i>|  exploitation.  The following argument is intended to show that an</i><br>
<i>|  exploitation of this magnitude is not absurd. First of all, the time</i><br>
<i>|  required for an expansion of population and industry by a factor of</i><br>
|  10^12 is quite short, say 3000 years if an average growth rate of<br>
|  1 percent per year is maintained. ...<br>

<p>
So, the "growth" of "civilized" humanity is at *least* half-way complete.
There are numerous articles that state quite clearly that the use of
interstellar travel as an escape valve on population growth is
*impossible* using known laws of physics.

<p>
So, sooner or later, we *will* hit the limits.

<p>
The carrying capacity of the planet or the solar system is entirely
dependent on the technology at your disposal.  Anyone making claims
about limits without also clearly stating their assumptions about
technology should be keelhauled until they agree to get it right.

<p>
The real limits on the number of "humans" are the mass &amp; energy limits.
Assuming around 3.4x10^24 kg of phosphorus in the solar system and
about 1.2 kg of phosphorus per person you get about 2.7x10^24 people.
Given the sun puts out 3.82x10^26 Watts, that gives you about 140
Watts/person.  Since a human requires about ~100 W, we are all
going to have to be on an energy diet unless we have *really* efficient
energy conversion technology.

<p>
<a name="4332qlink1">So, the *real* limit is an energy shortage around the time when you
have a trillion trillion people.  I suspect that you can bump that
a little using thermonuclear fusion reactors burning the fuel in
Jupiter &amp; Saturn, but I don't believe don't have enough construction
material to do much of that.  Ultimately we have to solve the problem
of how to efficiently mine metal out of the Sun.

<p>
So, the proper response to the longevity/population problem is

<UL>
  <li>  Well we are going to hit the limits sooner or later, which would
    you prefer, hitting it alive and (relatively) immortal, or dead?

</a>

</UL>
