<a name="0546qlink1">Yeah right.  We freely kill animals every day for our convenience.  I'm not
saying I have a moral objection to this, but why would a significantly
higher intelligence be so interested in our survival except for its own
convenience or curiosity.  Perhaps such an intelligence might discover that
it is to our own benefit that we should die (those humans are so messy, and
live only to make their own lives harder...  Some sort of euthenasia)</a>

<p>
As you said above, they need ot have a firm knowledge and conviction of
human morality (not for their sake, but for ours).  Perhaps they should be
the evolutionary winners, but damn it, I'm a human.
