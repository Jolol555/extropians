Gosh, Damien, it sounds like you have very discriminating taste!  As well
as a high level of security in your own identity.  Please pat yourself on
the back for me.

I actually just entered my own little experiment in 'grokking' the
other--I'm growing my hair out.  Now, this seems trivial, but it's fraught
with social baggage.  For over twenty years, I have cropped my hair in
order to fight the faint possibility of being coopted into the social mores
of the western feminine female.  Now, well, I want to play with the notion
of looking more 'normal' while publicly speaking about some of our wierd
ideas.  

<p>
But, as that hair grows out, I expect some things to happen, such as
learning what it's like to move out of that blessed androgyny and into a
more solid projection of the femme.  It's harder to critique that when
you're a part of it, and maybe I will gain some deeper respect for those
who prefer it.
