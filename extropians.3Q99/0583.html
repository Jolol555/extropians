See, eternity isn't just picture in picture stretching on and on, its
picture in picture all around you, below you, above you, and every picture
contains every other picture, and you are in no pictures but also in every

exists, and even the other ones exist!

concept may bear relation to the structure of eternity, we can discuss it if
you want....
