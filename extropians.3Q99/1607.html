<a href="1565.html#1607qlink1">&gt;&gt; I've often wondered why SF writers tend to harbor a belief in 'psi'.</a><br>

<p>
<a href="1565.html#1607qlink2">&gt;&gt; If only there were an SF writer on this list who had previously</a><br>
expressed an
<br>
<a href="1565.html#1607qlink3">&gt;&gt; interest in psi who I could ask about the subject...</a><br>

<p>
Ho ho. Okay, I'll bite... In my limited experience, most sf writers are as
hard-bitten and skeptical as anyone else. But we use the narrative enabling
devices to hand. Psi in sf is often pure magic (as is nanotech, etc),
appropriately since so much sf/fantasy is consolatory illusion. John
Campbell Jr, late editor of ASTOUNDING/ANALOG, might really have believed
in psi, or then again he might have found it a useful rhetorical device for
whipping up controversy in his pages. The many writers who then clambered
on the gravytrain did so just<a name="1640qlink1"> because it was the way to get their fiction
sold - and maybe because there's some pleasure to be had in working out the
next tweak on a hoary plot gadget.</a>

<p>
<a name="1640qlink2">Meanwhile, I myself have used psi and UFOs in certain stories, but always
in the knowledge that there is a difference between fact and fiction,
</a>Sherlock.<a name="1640qlink3"> Meanwhile meanwhile, I've also followed some of the statistical
and experimental arguments, and actually do regard the matter as still
open. I don't know how psi would work, or how it's consistent with what we
know of the brain's workings, but the accumulated anomalous data at PEAR,
for example, doesn't go away.</a>

I don't doubt it. I've visited several parapsychological research centers
in the USA and found more lurking loons than I'd wanted to see. But which
names would you cite in support of your own contention, Eliezer? You have
evidence that, say, Prof Jessica Utts is a lunatic? Other than, circularly,
her peer-reviewed-published conviction that psi is effectively proved by
her meta-analyses of `good' experimental results?</a>
