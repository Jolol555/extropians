<p>
No offense taken -- and there aren't really any "illegal questions" here (I 
can hear the howls . . .).  But when you ask about "the basics" it sometimes 
takes longer to muster a response satisfactory to the person who asks the 
question, because it's difficult to gauge the person making the inquiry's 
level of familiarity with our ideas and values . . .

<p>
Part of this is the feeling of having been right.  Some of us have been 
exploring these ideas and coming to basically the conclusions you've seen 
discussed here for 30 years or even more.  When things you've been thinking 
for decades all of a sudden become "news", you can't help but be a little 
self-congratulatory.</a>

<a name="4638qlink3"><a href="4478.html#4515qlink3">&gt;  The changes that I see taking place towards the end of this century,</a><br>
<i>&gt;  including those changes in discussion about the following century, seem</i><br>
<i>&gt;  nothing other than the logical, historically predicitable, outcome of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  the renaissance and the enlightenment. We're descendants of Bacon,</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Descartes, Newton, etc. Science improves, and eventually turns its eye</i><br>
<i>&gt;  towards the brain, towards artificial brains, and so on. This seems</i><br>
<i>&gt;  totally obvious, and was predicted years ago.</i><br>

<p>
Seems obvious to me, too :-) Which is why I have repeatedly called 
transhumanism and especially extropianism "The New Enlightenment."</a>  
  
<p>
<a href="4478.html#4515qlink4">&gt;  In a historically local way, advocacy plays a role in the</a><br>
<i>&gt;  particularities of how things develop. Is that what's being toasted?</i><br>

<p>
Partly - see below.

<a name="4638qlink4"><a href="4482.html#4515qlink5">&gt;  I guess my general question would be: What's the big deal? I get the</a><br>
<i>&gt;  sense that a lot of what I read here is just cheerleading for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  inevitable. I don't mean to say that it's not very cool stuff being</i><br>
<i>&gt;  celebrated. But it's just the train we're on, little more.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; We should be in the mainstream *while* maintaining our daring</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; and original character.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Another way to ask my question would be: what is it that's daring here?</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Sorry. I don't mean to be difficult. But I really don't get it. It makes</i><br>
<i>&gt;  me think that what really matters here are minor political battles like</i><br>
<i>&gt;  those involving Rifkin. Rifkin and his type are dead or dying. Speeding</i><br>
<i>&gt;  up the inevitable by a few years is a good goal, I won't argue that.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Showing how Rifkin is silly might achieve that. But I don't see how it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;  *daring*.</i><br>

<p>
Consider the world mid-20th-century that Hayek and a few others faced: 
Pseudoscientific, anti-humanist totalitarian hogwash (and worse) had caused a 
tide of blood to surge over half the world.  The Renaissance and 
Enlightenment ideals of free inquiry and exchange were under attack from many 
fronts.  Even the societies that had achieved greatness by embodying those 
ideals were turning their backs on them.  Jeremy Rifkin didn't just happen by 
accident.  

<p>
While it would be nice to believe that progress of the classic liberal, 
humanist and scientific programs is truly inevitable, I think it is dangerous 
to do so, because it cedes the energy of advocacy to the enemies of these 
agendas.  Creeping statism, anti-scientific attitudes and cultural pessimism 
became dangerous because the forces that had propelled progress in all these 
things became complacent.  The Renaissance and Enlightenment program of 
developing an integrated scientific world-view became a far from universal 
motivating ideal.  Instead the corrosive mentality of deconstructionist 
post-modernism came to dominate in academia and began to seriously undermine 
the integrity of the scientific method on many fronts.

<p>
<a name="4638qlink5">Transhumanism and extropianism are "daring" in exactly the same way that 
humanism, science and classical liberalism were "daring" when they were new.  
In historical terms (to say nothing of biological terms), these ideas are 
very, very new.</a>  Superstition and mindless submission to authority are in 
fact the "mainstream" of human history.  Personally, I believe that failure 
to maintain an energetic effort to continue the progress we've had so far 
will result in a return to the norm of human history: If we don't WORK at 
being rational, we won't be, as a species; instead, we'll just be stupid with 
more powerful tools.
  
<p>
<a href="4478.html#4515qlink6">&gt;  (And does "meme" mean "idea"?)</a><br>

<p>
<a name="4519qlink1">A "meme" is to "ideas" (or information, really) what a "gene" is to an 
organism.  "Memetics" is the notion that information reproduces and evolves 
in a manner analogous to genes.</a>  This notion was orginally expressed as a 
sort of afterthought in Richard Dawkins "The Selfish Gene" and has since 
spawned some fairly rich speculation and analysis by fleshing out his 
metaphorical thinking on the subject.
