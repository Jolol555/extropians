<a name="2755qlink1">Thank you.  This is certainly true and in perspective.  What so many 
Mensans, extropians, libertarians have tended to ignore is the overwhelming 
evidence that it is quite possible to create much different</a> environments for 
<a name="2755qlink2">children.  Even if Burt were correct, the 20% on top of a genetically high 
base would be worth the effort.  That's the difference between brilliance 
and genius.  Since the evidence indicates that the difference is 
considerably higher, it is an indication of serious problems when we see 
intelligent people ignoring this opportunity.  But those problems are 
another thread...</a>

<i>&gt;Studies on twins trace approximately two thirds of IQ to genetic variation.</i><br>

<i>&gt;From:</i><br>
<i>&gt;<a href="http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/Issues/psychology/IQ/bouchard-twins.ht">http://www.cycad.com/cgi-bin/Upstream/Issues/psychology/IQ/bouchard-twins.ht</a></i><br>
<i>&gt;ml</i><br>
<i>&gt;General intelligence or IQ is strongly affected by genetic factors. The IQs</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the adult MZA twins assessed with various instruments in four </i><br>
<i>&gt;independent</i><br>
<i>&gt;studies correlate about 0.70, indicating that about 70% of the observed</i><br>
<i>&gt;variation in IQ in this population can be attributed to genetic variation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since only a few of these MZA twins were reared in real poverty or by</i><br>
<i>&gt;illiterate parents and none were retarded, this heritability estimate </i><br>
<i>&gt;should</i><br>
<i>&gt;not be extrapolated to the extremes of environmental disadvantage still</i><br>
<i>&gt;encountered in society. Moreover, these findings do not imply that traits</i><br>
<i>&gt;like IQ cannot be enhanced. Flynn [35], in a survey covering 14 countries,</i><br>
<i>&gt;has shown that the average IQ test score has significantly increased in</i><br>
<i>&gt;recent years. This increase may be limited to that part of the population</i><br>
<i>&gt;with low IQs [36]. The present findings, therefore, do not define or limit</i><br>
<i>&gt;what might be conceivably achieved in an optimal environment. They do</i><br>
<i>&gt;indicate that, in the current environments of the broad middle-class, in</i><br>
<i>&gt;industrialized societies, two-thirds of the observed variance of IQ can be</i><br>
<i>&gt;traced to genetic variation.</i><br>
