<a name="2331qlink1">I did think about a self-reproducing worm.  With it we could do away with
the server and let the worms report to each other.  For instance, say</a> a worm
<a name="2333qlink2"><a name="2331qlink2">has searched data spaces 1, 2, and 3, and, detecting that its host is
on-line, starts propergating to random IPs.  Its children do one of two
things; if no worm is detected on the new IP the new worm will take root</a> and
</a>
<a name="2331qlink3">search random data spaces (with probabilities weighted against 1, 2, and 3).
If an existing worm is detected the new worm copies its data (i.e. "data
spaces 1, 2, and 3, searched with no success") to the existing worm and
terminates (or in other terms, it merges -- this could also be used to
update the worm).  I'm using random data as much as possible because it cuts
down on data exchange and means the worms don't have to keep track of each
other.  Error correction would be through massive redundancy (the worms
would only have an increased probability of avoiding an already searched
space so many searches will be performed on the same space).</a>  The whole
<a name="2331qlink4">system of searching for primes, hiding, merging, copying, and checking for
errors could probably be packed into a very small, very efficient program.
You could expect to unleash it on the net and within months have a fresh new
10 million digit prime and a $100K cheque.  Well worth the investment of
some time and a little intellectual hardship.
<p>
    The reason I went with the novelty attachment idea is that if there were
an unexpected bug in the program (and there's bound to be an unexpected bug
in the program) there'd be less chance of crashing something important and
pissing a lot of people off.</a>

<i>&gt; hard to kill indeed, because it would mutate faster than patch</i><br>
<i>&gt; distribution. Trying to infect routers and switches is another good</i><br>

<a name="2331qlink5">I don't think detection is much of a threat, the majority of people don't
worry about viruses until their system crashes.  Of course if someone</a> found
