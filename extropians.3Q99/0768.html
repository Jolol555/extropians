You mean,"Don't confuse me with the facts, my mind is made up."?</a>

I

<i>&gt; &gt; Math is math, and is the same math everywhere in the universe.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; You and everyone else on this planet have absolutely no evidence whatsoever</i><br>

<i>&gt; things we have encountered...it may not be the exact tool that dissimilar</i><br>
<i>&gt; civilisations use. True, there are probably basic similarities, but no way</i><br>
<i>&gt; will I buy that any civilisation would certainly understand one of our</i><br>
<i>&gt; equations when faced with it, even having explained the symbols etc... </i><br>

<p>
As this is the root of your confusion.<a name="0836qlink2"> You make the same mistake that
many one language people do about words. They think that c-h-i-c-k-e-n
is obviously synonymous with the concept of a chicken that they get
really confused when asked to use the word pollo to represent the
concept of chicken.</a> When we talk about math concepts being common
througout the universe, we do not mean that they will use the numerals
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-0, or the functional symbols x,-,/,+ etc. We ourselves
have used, and continue to use several symbols for each funtion (i.e. we
can use x or . or * for multiplication), but our concept of
multiplication does not change when we use different symbols to
represent the concept.

<p>
<a href="0699.html#0768qlink3">&gt; Basic</a><br>
<i>&gt; concepts such as why, how, systems thinking and linear time may not be as</i><br>
<i>&gt; they are here due to the brain (or equivalent) structure of the observers,</i><br>
<i>&gt; providing a very different perspective from which to view and therefore</i><br>
<i>&gt; describe the universe.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0836qlink3">Again, as I have said, we ourselves have come up with a number of
different systems, including several kinds of non-euclidian geometry.
That we continue to use the systems we do use is a result of the
physical properties of the universe, not the properties of our minds.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="0836qlink4"><a href="0699.html#0768qlink4">&gt; &gt; Any species more advanced than us is going to KNOW any math that we</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; know.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; They will know the natural systems/laws/relationships that the math</i><br>
<i>&gt; describes, yes, but no way will they definitely describe it in exactly the</i><br>
<i>&gt; same way as us.</i><br>

<p>
We have been looking at it from a system/laws/relationships basis,</a> since
<a name="0836qlink5">any idiot knows that aliens will not be speaking our language.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="0699.html#0768qlink5">&gt; &gt; They will know other maths, but if they are interested in</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; communicating with primitve species, they will use maths that are common</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; among primitive societies.</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; If such commonality exists.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;         Remember - in all this, I MERELY point out that you people CANNOT be</i><br>
<i>&gt; as cocksure as you seem that all civilisations throughout the universe will</i><br>
<i>&gt; use math exactly as we use it.</i><br>
