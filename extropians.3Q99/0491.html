Neutrinos are rather easy to generate, as they are produced by many
nuclear reactions.  But they are very difficult to detect, and even more
difficult to control, using present technology.  It is believed that
trillions of neutrinos pass thru an object the size of a human body each
second.  Most neutrinos which strike the earth pass right on thru without
interacting with anything.  There are already so many neutrinos coursing
thru the space around us that even if we did have a reliable method of
detecting them there would still be the problem of sorting out the ones
which carry the message we are looking for.  There are believed to be
several different types of neutrinos, and some types might have a small
amount of mass.


<p>
We use photons to carry messages (radio, TV, etc.).  With photon
communication, frequency filters and (sometimes) directivity of antennas
are used to sort out the particular photons which carry the message we
are looking for.  For example, the channel selector on a TV set controls
a frequency filter, and a receivers for signals from satellites sometimes
use a directive dish antenna which must be pointed at the appropriate
satellite, thus excluding photons from other directions.


<p>
Gravitons are not photons.  Gravitons, if they exist, would be the
particles which mediate the graviational force, just as photons are the
particles which mediate the electromagnetic force.  Gravitational waves
are thought to be produced when matter accelerates or vibrates.  They are
thought to travel thru space at the speed of light, and they are very
difficult to detect with present technology.<a name="0551qlink1">  Gravity waves are a
different phenomenon than gravitational waves.  Gravity waves are waves
consisting of the motion of fluid matter in a gravitational field.  The
ripples on the surface of a pond are called gravity waves.</a>
