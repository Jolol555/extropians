<a href="0062.html#0106qlink1">&gt; It's cool to see someone else on this list that does lucid dreaming.  I do</a><br>
<i>&gt; this, but it's not wide-spread as far as I know.  I have had major periods</i><br>
<i>&gt; of overwork where I literally worked full time except for sleep.  By</i><br>
<i>&gt; controlling my dreams and simulating an hour on the beach or something, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; woke up more refreshed and ready to work again.  When I don't dream (or</i><br>
more
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink2">&gt; accurately, when I don't remember dreaming) it seems like I just went to</a><br>
bed
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink3">&gt; and its time to go to work again, and I'm not ready to go back to work.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I also have performed real design work in dreams.  During the above week</i><br>
of
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink4">&gt; hell, I have gone to sleep, designed a solution to problems, and woke up</a><br>
<i>&gt; ready to implement the design the next morning.  I presented the design</i><br>
<i>&gt; idea, and actually billed time for the design work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; This is not always reliable, however.  Sometimes you don't dream or don't</i><br>
<i>&gt; become lucid while dreaming.  Sometimes you don't maintain full lucidity.</i><br>
<i>&gt; You dream that you came up with a good design, and you wake up and realize</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it doesn't make sense.  Sometimes dreams get weird and seem</i><br>
reasonable
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink5">&gt; until you wake up.  Usually the consciousness achieved in lucid dreaming</a><br>
<i>&gt; prevents the random dream-generators from kicking in, but occasionally</i><br>
there
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink6">&gt; is some overlap where the lucid dream still has some fictional elements</a><br>
<i>&gt; thrown in.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; For those who don't know what we're talking about:  Lucid dreaming is when</i><br>
<i>&gt; you realize that you are dreaming.  You thereby become conscious inside</i><br>
your
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink7">&gt; dream.  Once you realize its a dream, you can control it by visualizing</a><br>
what
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink8">&gt; you want to see, and the dream-generating facilities of the subconscious</a><br>
<i>&gt; take over and create what you visualized.  Basically, it is a</i><br>
<i>&gt; super-realistic holodeck.  Anything you can imagine seems to be real.  You</i><br>
<i>&gt; get full sensory feedback, so you can do long division on paper, because</i><br>
you
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink9">&gt; see the paper and the writing holds constant and seems real.  You can</a><br>
think
<br>
<a href="0062.html#0106qlink10">&gt; logically and generate a design or a check list in your head, and when you</a><br>
<a name="0138qlink10"><i>&gt; wake up you have accomplished real work/planning while sleeping.</i><br>
<i>&gt; --</i><br>

</a>
<p>
<a name="0113qlink1">I have lucid dreamed a few times, but now I always wake up</a> immediately after
I
<br>
<a name="0138qlink11"><a name="0113qlink2">become lucid.  Does anyone happen to know how to stop this</a> from happening?
<a name="0138qlink12">I have heard that as soon as you become lucid, you become more aware of
outside stimula because you are more aware of your senses than in normal
dreaming, but if you spin while in the lucid dream, you can stay dreaming
because
</a>
<br>
much of your sensory abilities are being used to simulate the spinning and
to keep
<br>
<a name="0138qlink13">you balanced, basically distracting you from outside stimula...</a>I have not
<a name="0138qlink14">tried this yet
</a>
<br>
though....
