<p>
I can understand this, though I try to look at ideas not people for the most
part.

<p>
I remain unconvinced, but that some might work and how it works are two
different things.  An Ancient Arab herbalist might prescribe valerian for
sleep and attribute its power to some spiritual essence.  (I'm making this
up; I don't know if any Arab herbalists held any such views.)  He or she
might be right in that it works to assist one in sleeping yet be completely
off base with the spiritual essence line.

<p>
<a href="1495.html#1500qlink4">&gt; But: the real question is "Does it work?"</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Beyond my own family's successes in treatment of chronic health concerns,</i><br>

<i>&gt; where there could be no placebo effect -- the treatment of horses, dogs,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and babies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'd be happy to cite studies or to elaborate, but my real concern is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; dismissive tone of</i><br>
<i>&gt; the postings.  It reminds me too much of the way the rest of the world</i><br>
<i>&gt; dismisses</i><br>
<i>&gt; libertarianism as unrealistic and nanotechnology as fantasy.</i><br>

<p>
I hope you will cite some of them.  The first step should always be seeing
what is the case, then, on that, we can plumb into the causal mechanisms.

<p>
Now, in this case, it might be that most homeoparthic stuff is utter
garbage, but I'd rather know here than guess.

<a name="1539qlink1">For the record, I've tried a few of them myself.  I found one for allergies
seemed to work quite well (I think it was Naturapathic brand stuff) the
_first_ time I used it, but proved ineffective later on.  (Now, I stick to
vitamin B5, which works just fine for me as long as I take a sufficiently
high dose.)</a>

Cheers!
