<i>&gt; &gt; The gist of the article was that Japan is aging very quickly</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  and will experience sharp declines in population during the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  next century.  The result being that Japan's relative importance</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  in the world will decline.  The existence of once bustling</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  islands that now have only a few elderly residents (that</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  the government nevertheless spends huge sums on to ensure</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  ongoing regular ferry service and all modern conveniences</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  as a matter of honor and obligation) was used to introduce</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;  this point.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Look. This is a really interesting article you have presented. However, Japan </i><br>
<i>&gt; being depicted as being filled with nothing but oldsters can't be right-or at </i><br>
<i>&gt; least the focus isn't.  Perhaps the Japan of the 2010 -2050 era may be </i><br>
<i>&gt; depicted as a place which has lossed a huge amount fo population compared to </i><br>
<i>&gt; the 1980's.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3746qlink1"><a name="3726qlink1">Significant population decrease isn't that likely, even if Japan due
its currently stringent immigration laws is causing a certain
population decrease (in most western countries it is just immigration
that keeps the population from decreasing). The big problem is a
greying population: 25% over 65 will put a significant strain to any
current pension system.</a></a> 

<p>
<a name="3746qlink2"><a href="3571.html#3707qlink2">&gt; But conversely, is a much richer place because of computerized </a><br>
<i>&gt; robotic technology and a smaller population to support. Lets say that a </i><br>
<i>&gt; population of 75-80 million(versus 120 million today) isn't exactly, a dearth </i><br>
<i>&gt; of people for a total land area the size of Oregon.  </i><br>

<p>
<a name="3714qlink2">Less young people = less capital invested in homemaking, schools and
<a name="3712qlink1">other activities involving the young and setting up families.</a> A
<a name="3714qlink3">decreased population may have a hard time keeping the economy afloat,
especially if a large percentage is retired.</a> Robotization doesn't
occur magically overnight.</a>
