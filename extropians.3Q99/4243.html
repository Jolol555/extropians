<a name="4246qlink1">I've that my biology teacher recently told us to
pursue some particular world problem-pollution,
overpopulation, etc., etc.  My chosen problem to
confront, however, was violent behavior.  While many
other subjects are interesting, I'd already done them.
And done them. Ad nauseum.  What I was thinking is
that since your all in the business of answering tough
questions (been on the list for at least a few months)
I was wondering if you could provide me with opinion,
commentary, et al., but most importantly, NUMBERS! I
was hoping you could lead me to some interesting
studies on the subject... I would like source
information as well.  Any help would be appreciated. 
Besides, if I get enough information, we might get
another person on the list- Mr. Brosius seemed kind of
interested in all of us.  I would be very priviledged
to consider myself one of you anyway- I am not yet
involved, per se, but I'm working towards technology
and science as a major focus on future careers.</a>  I
<a name="4244qlink1">would be glad to receive any help and information on
the causes (and methods of reducing) violence as
</a>possible.
