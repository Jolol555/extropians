Extropy Institute's Extro 4 Conference:

<p>
B I O T E C H  F U T U R E S
<br>
Challenges of Life Extension and Genetic Engineering

<p>
August 7-8, 1999, UC Berkeley


<p>
Since my last update, we have added some new speakers, and made other
alterations to the program. 

<p>
I'm pleased to be able to announce that Vernor Vinge and Greg Bear will
combine their visionary talents to think about the implications of greatly
extended lives.

<p>
Dr. Kate Murashige of Morrison &amp; Foerster, who specializes in intellectual
property law and the life sciences, will be speaking on gene patents. As
you'll see, if you check out her bio at 

<p>

we could hardly hope to find anyone more qualified and talented to speak on
this topic.

<p>
John H. Campbell, Professor of Neurobiology at the UCLA School of Medicine
will speak on "HuGE Propects for Human Genetic Engineering". A few of you
may have heard Prof. Campbell speak at Greg Stock's UCLA conference last year.

<p>
The latest Program is at:

<p>
Media interest in this event is already looking strong. The conference
should be an excellent means of getting a wider audience to think about
these issues. 

<p>
The final session (which Anders Sandberg has agreed to coordinate) will be
on getting our culture up to speed by learning how to communicate our ideas
more effectively. I'd like to see this session be a more interactive one,
perhaps with conference attendees signing up for a few minutes to express
their views on this.

<p>
Onward!

<p>
