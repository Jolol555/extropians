Rik, why would you *expect* to understand what a huge
brain would think about, given our modest glob of neurons?
Would not an ant be at a loss to understand what we are
pondering at this very moment?  I suspect that a planet sized
brain could figure out by inference what a deceased person
must have been like, from examining the memories of the living.

<p>
Perhaps this process could be so perfected as to effectively
resurrect those who have passed on without having been
cryopreserved.  I hope so, for it would please me beyond
words to see my grandpa again, or failing that, a good digital
simulation of him created from my and others' memories.  spike
