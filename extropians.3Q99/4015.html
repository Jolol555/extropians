I would like to address for a moment the categorization of 'radical
feminists'.  

<p>
There are in reality two categorical labels, one claimed by the individual
feminist, and one put onto the individual feminist by persons who disagree
with her particular viewpoint.  This labeling seems to be very dependent
upon the circumstances, and oftentimes external to the content of the
writings in question.  

<p>
In my own experience, having short hair and expressing a libertarian
viewpoint can get any woman labeled a 'radical feminist', even if she isn't
expressing the viewpoint of the self-identified radical feminists.  It has
become shorthand among the right wing for any outspoken woman, and we have
learned to laugh it off.  But I would also hope that the libertarians
themselves would not engage in this kind of labeling.  Many self-identified
radical feminists support libertarian ideas, more than they are getting
credit for.
