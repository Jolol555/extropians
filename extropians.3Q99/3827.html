&gt;&gt; I think this is the main open question, yes. I
&gt;&gt; have not seen an argument that validity (or truth)
&gt;&gt; should be understood as utility that isn't
&gt;&gt; circular. This is the problem with pragmatism
&gt;&gt; (especially the American variety). --&gt;

&gt;&gt; -How do you know utility is what
&gt;&gt;     should count as validity (or truth)?
&gt;&gt; "It works."
&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt; -How do you know "It works" is a valid
&gt;&gt;     criterion?
&gt;&gt; "It works."

<p>
Probably that latter (though I can't be certain -- I did read a lot of
pragmatists and utilitarians for a long time; but I'm not up on contemporary
pragmatism), where "funny" means unusual (in this group of people).

Appreciate your comments, though I don't see how the same, or a similar problem
wouldn't arise again. But tell me what your answer to the below would be (and/or
change the questions and answers, if I've missed what you're driving at).


<hr>
<br>
-How do you know what to believe?
<br>
"Believe what works."

<p>
-What do you mean by "what works"?
<br>
"What's ethical."

<pre>
<a name="3843qlink1">-What's ethical?
- [Your answer here.]
---------------------------------------------------

</pre>
<p>
Actually, I imagine your answer would be very long, and don't expect you to give
it. But I've found that most answers to that question come back to utility. So
there's still a circle, but just a slightly more complicated one.</a>
