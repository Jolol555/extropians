<a name="2347qlink1"><a name="2173qlink1">In increasing order of "mad-scientist factor", here's three interesting 
pieces about promising new propulsion technologies (apologies if these have 
appeared here before; I've been weeding pretty ruthlessly in my in-box and 
may have missed a previous post of these items):

Sacramento - August 10, 1999 - NASA's Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) has 
<a name="2347qlink2"><a name="2173qlink2">awarded GenCorp Aerojet a multimillion dollar extension for continued 
development of the Strutjet Rocket-Based Combined Cycle (RBCC)</a> engine through 
</a>
2001.
<br>
<a name="2173qlink3">This revolutionary propulsion system combines air-breathing</a> and rocket engine 
<a name="2347qlink3"><a name="2173qlink4">technologies in a single engine for use on future reusable, 
single-stage-to-orbit launch vehicles. This type of engine allows</a> the vehicle 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink4"><a name="2173qlink5">to take off horizontally, like an airplane, for greater safety and 
reliability and a dramatic reduction in cost of access to space.</a> The Strutjet 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink5"><a name="2173qlink6">RBCC is a candidate as the primary propulsion for a third-generation space 
shuttle engine.

<p>
"Aerojet is proud to be working closely with MSFC as it moves forward on <br>
reusable launch vehicle technology. We believe our technology will provide 
the capability for early demonstration of a vehicle powered by an RBCC 
engine," said Bob Harris, vice president, Strategic and Space Propulsion.

<p>
Since 1996, Aerojet has successfully progressed in building the Strutjet 
RBCC, which is part of MSFC's Advanced Reusable Technologies Project. This 
contract extension will refine the Strutjet RBCC into a highly integrated 
engine/vehicle concept, and a new emphasis will be placed on the development 
of flight-type cooled components, including the use of advanced</a> materials and 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink6"><a name="2173qlink7">fabrication processes. These flight-type components will be exposed</a> to engine 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink7"><a name="2173qlink8">thermal environments in a Component Development Rig at Aerojet's Sacramento 
site.

<p>
The Strutjet RBCC is an advanced, hydrogen-fueled engine that combines the 
best elements of air-breathing and rocket propulsion. It operates initially 
as an air-augmented rocket as it accelerates to low supersonic speeds, 
transitions to ramjet operation by turning off the rockets, then converts to 
a scramjet as flight speed increases. The rockets are turned back on as 
atmospheric oxygen diminishes, then the engine transitions to a 
high-expansion rocket for final ascent.

<p>
During the initial program phase, the Strutjet RBCC demonstrated superior 
performance and a robust operating capability in wind tunnel tests over the 
entire flight operating range. Also, Aerojet's patented cascade</a> fuel injector 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink8"><a name="2173qlink9">efficiency and rocket durability and flexibility have been proven in the 
large number of tests conducted.

<p>
Aerojet, a leading proponent of RBCC propulsion, has demonstrated excellent 
performance using both hydrogen and hydrocarbon fuels, providing evidence of 
the flexibility of this engine. Aided by Aerojet technology advances on this 
program, NASA placed recent emphasis on continuing the advancement of this 
promising concept through flight.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="2347qlink9"><a name="2173qlink10">Aerojet, a leader in propulsion, electronics and weapon systems, and fine 
chemicals, is a segment of GenCorp, a technology-driven company with strong 
positions in polymer products, automotive, and aerospace and defense 
industries.

Washington - August 12, 1999 - Researchers at NASA'ss Glenn Research Center 
</a>
</a>
have made for the first time tiny particles of frozen hydrogen suspended in 
liquid helium, a first step towards new rocket fuels that could revolutionize 
<a name="2347qlink10"><a name="2173qlink11">rocket propulsion technology.
<br>
In the experiments, small amounts of liquid hydrogen were poured onto the 
surface of liquid helium. The liquid hydrogen was at a temperature of 14 
kelvins (minus 435 degrees F), just above freezing point; and the liquid 
helium was held at 4 kelvins (minus 452 degrees F), or just above absolute 
zero.

<p>
As the liquid hydrogen fell toward the surface of the helium, small, solid 
hydrogen particles formed and then floated on the surface of the helium.

<p>
The suspension will be used to make futuristic atomic fuels that take 
advantage of the chemical recombination of atoms into molecules.

<p>
"Atomic fuels will make possible rockets with liftoff weights one-fifth that <br>
of today's or with payloads three to four times more massive," said Bryan 
Palaszewski, Glenn principal investigator for the experiment.

<p>
Using atomic fuels could reduce or eliminate on-orbit assembly</a> of large space 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink11"><a name="2173qlink12">vehicles, thereby eliminating multiple launches and years of assembly time 
and making flights to all parts of the solar system less expensive and more 
practicable.

<p>
In atomic fuels, atoms of very active elements would be stored in a medium 
that prevents their recombination. Solid molecular hydrogen is a promising 
medium for storing and keeping atoms separate because it becomes solid at 
temperatures just a few degrees above absolute zero, where atomic activity 
due to heat is at a minimum.

<p>
Helium, in turn, is the ideal medium for creating and holding the solid 
hydrogen particles because it remains liquid below the freezing point of 
hydrogen. In the rocket's reaction chamber, or engine, the fuel would warm, 
and the atoms would be freed.

<p>
In less than an instant, they would recombine into molecules, and 
temperatures would go from 4 to 2000 kelvins (minus 452 to 3140 degrees F). 
Both hydrogen and helium would instantly vaporize and shoot out</a> of the engine 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink12"><a name="2173qlink13">at tremendous speed, propelling the rocket forward. 

<p>
Details about the behavior and characteristics of the particles</a> are described 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink13"><a name="2173qlink14">in a paper presented at the U.S. Air Force High Energy Density Materials 
Meeting in Cocoa Beach, FL, in June of this year.

<p>
The advanced fuels experiments are part of Glenn's continuing efforts to 
advance the state of the art of propulsion technology. The experiments were 
conducted under the auspices of the NASA Advanced Space Transportation 
Program (ASTP), led by NASA Marshall Space Flight Center, Hunstville, AL. 
Current research is underway with an extensive team</a> that includes researchers 
</a>
<a name="2347qlink14"><a name="2173qlink15">from Glenn, Marshall, the U.S. Air Force, the Department of Energy,

<p>
Concepts could yield new propulsion techniques in a few years Terry Kammash, 
an astrophysicist and engineer at the University of Michigan, is developing 
a concept for a gas-dynamic mirror fusion propulsion engine.

<p>
By Anne Rueter
<br>
NEWHOUSE NEWS SERVICE

<p>
ANN ARBOR, Mich., Aug. 11-To Terry Kammash, going to the stars is not sci-fi 
stuff. In the new millennium, the nuclear engineer envisions missions to 
Alpha Centauri, closest star to our solar system. In just the next 20 to 25 
years, he predicts spacecraft will reach one milepost on the route, the Oort 
Cloud, a debris-filled comet belt 932 billion miles away. And he’s betting 
the missions will use fusion, the basic energy source of stars themselves.

<p>
NEVER MIND that efficient fusion reactors to power industry and light our 
homes have so far eluded scientists and engineers. Kammash has designed two 
propulsion engines that take one of fusion’s serious flaws and turn</a> it into 
an asset for space travel. And as scientists search for ways to explore the 
vast distances in space, Kammash’s most developed design looks like a 
front-runner.

</a><p>
The physics is well understood, the technology is available, said Kammash, a 
University of Michigan professor emeritus. It’s just a question of putting 
it together.

<p>
That’s what NASA scientists have been doing at the Marshall Space Flight 
Center in Huntsville, Ala., where several alternatives to chemical rockets 
are being explored. Kammash’s concept is the furthest along, said Bill 
Emrich, a senior engineer at the center. He’s getting a working model ready 
to test the design the first such test of fusion propulsion for use in 
space.

<p>
I think it’s a reasonably promising (concept), although there are others 
that look promising too, Emrich said. It’s hard to say at this point which 
one is going to be the winner.

<p>
FUSION IN A YEAR OR TWO?
<br>
Kammash’s gas-dynamic mirror engine holds promise for faster travel to 
planets such as Mars and Pluto. Emrich and other NASA scientists have 
electromagnets in place in a 2-meter-long model of the engine. In the next 
few months, they hope to start injecting plasma, the superheated fuel that 
the magnets are designed to confine long enough to produce nuclear fusion 
reactions. The scientists hope to achieve fusion during the next year or 
two.

<p>
Meanwhile, Kammash is pushing forward with his second engine design, one 
with the thrust needed for more distant interstellar missions. He got a 
boost recently when this design was among a handful of propulsion ideas to 
receive funding from NASA’s newly formed Institute for Advanced Concepts.

<p>
Both engines, Kammash said, aim to cut to a realistic level the time and 
cost of missions to planets in our solar system and beyond. And time is of 
the essence. Using conventional chemical rockets, missions to Mars are long 
enough to be daunting for humans: At seven to nine months each way, a trip 
might last two years. At a typical shuttle speed of 17,600 mph, it would 
take 168,000 years or more for a robotic mission to reach Alpha Centauri.

<p>
<a name="2347qlink16"><a name="2173qlink17">Kammash estimates his gas-dynamic mirror fusion propulsion engine would take 
three to four months to travel to Mars and back. He thinks his newer design, 
fast enough for interstellar missions, could reach Alpha Centauri, 259 
trillion miles away, in as little as 213 years. This new engine might take a 
mere 29 years to make a one-way trip to the Oort Cloud.

<p>
Now it costs $10,000 to put a kilogram in space, Kammash said. He and other 
space scientists take seriously NASA’s challenge to cut this figure to 
$2,000 or less. Alternative propulsion methods are key because conventional 
fuels for long missions are extremely bulky and costly. It takes huge 
amounts of fuel to lift a spacecraft into space if it must carry fuel to 
travel to distant planets or stars.

<p>
OTHER OPTIONS
<br>
Fusion energy, produced when the light nuclei of certain atoms fuse together 
under intense heat, is not the only energy source being eyed for 
long-distance space missions. Energy from fission, the splitting</a> of heavy 
atoms, is still a contender. Fission rockets, though they evoke safety 
concerns, haven’t been abandoned and could power missions to the relatively 
near moon and Mars. For more distant ones, scientists believe fusion has 
</a>greater potential.

<p>
The idea of a robotic mission to explore the environs of Alpha Centauri 
draws many skeptics, but also many restless minds eager to try. If man does 
not explore he becomes stagnant, civilization becomes stagnant, Kammash 
said.

<p>
Streams of leaking energy are one reason fusion hasn’t lived up to hopes as 
an energy source on Earth. Some fusion reactors have had trouble producing 
more energy than they lose because hot plasma, the system’s fuel, is hard to 
contain. Kammash worked on designs for such fusion reactors for decades. 
Fusion enthusiasm ran high in the late 1970s and early ’80s; now Congress 
continues to reduce funds for fusion research.

<p>
In the early 1990s, Kammash came to see possibilities in fusion’s problems.
You want to eject hot plasma because that’s propulsion, Kammash said. Fusion 
is inherently leaky, so let’s take advantage of it.

<p>
The gas-dynamic mirror engine relies on powerful magnets to create 
electromagnetic fields that will confine plasma particles long enough for 
sufficient fusion reactions to occur. Mirror refers to the magnetic fields 
at each end that bounce particles back and forth. The engine retains some of 
the plasma to keep the fusion reaction going, and lets a fraction of it 
escape through a nozzle to produce thrust.

<p>
THE ANTIMATTER FACTOR
<br>
The second engine, called MICF (Magnetically Insulated Inertial Confinement 
Fusion), uses a different method to achieve fusion. A laser beam zaps 
BB-sized pellets of fuel, creating a hot plasma contained by a metallic 
shell. The plasma should be contained long enough to lead to large energy 
gains, Kammash writes in Ad Astra, a magazine read by astronauts and other 
space enthusiasts.

<p>
His idea is a concept that brings together antimatter and fusion propulsion, 
said Robert Cassanova, director of the Institute for Advanced Concepts. We 
<a name="2347qlink17"><a name="2173qlink18">found that intriguing.

<p>
Instead of a laser, Kammash ultimately wants to use antimatter, an 
experimental technique, to zap the fuel pellets. Giant particle accelerators 
produce fleeting forms of antimatter. Scientists are trying to find ways to 
trap one form, antiprotons, and use the energy they produce. Using a stream 
of antiprotons instead of a bulky laser apparatus would make Kammash’s 
design very attractive in space.
