I agree.  The BBC post might explain the problem with Pioneer 10.
But I believe the probes did go off in different directions and
so you would have to suggest that they both have encountered such
objects.  But that would seem to imply a really high abundance of
such objects!?!  I think there are also problems if the acceleration
vector is towards the sun, since if you went flying past an object
with enough mass to pull you back towards it (with the sun behind
it in a line-of-sight), then that object is likely to significantly
alter your trajectory as well.

<p>
Between this report and the Mars mission probable crash one could
suspect that long-range interplanetary/stellar navigation is
difficult.

<p>
I've thought in the past that nanoseed interstellar colonization
would be feasible, but perhaps it isn't due to the difficulties
of aiming non-powered/non-sighted seeds someplace useful.  If
your chance of hitting a planet light years away is so small
that you have to send out 10^12-10^20 of them, then you haven't
gained much on the old problem of having to send a World Ship
(which has to travel very slowly due to the energy requirements).
If the cost of sending seeds at relativistic speeds and the
cost of sending World Ships at 1/10 c speeds are comparable,
then I suspect you could begin to ask whether it makes more
sense to take the entire star system (at even slower speeds)?
