the

a

the

Well, that doesn't sound so bad after all. In fact, it sounds better than
the secular/public school childhood I endured. Religious memes (uh-oh, here
I go again) probably catch more flies with honey than with vinegar.

<p>
<a href="3573.html#3580qlink11">&gt;Beyond this, I was never "compelled to believe" in any oppressive way.  As</a><br>
a
<br>
<a href="3573.html#3580qlink12">&gt;result, I never had to have a "crisis of faith" like so many people who</a><br>
were
<br>
<a href="3573.html#3580qlink13">&gt;raised in religious surroundings.  Instead, I just naturally came to doubt</a><br>
<i>&gt;the underlying ideas more and more, but in fact never lost an appreciation</i><br>
<i>&gt;for the ceremony of the Roman practice.  Far from a "childhood of psychic</i><br>
<i>&gt;abuse", I recall those times fondly as one in which I was educated in an</i><br>
<i>&gt;ancient tradition that seemed more like something out of Hesse's "Glass</i><br>
Bead
<br>
<a href="3573.html#3580qlink14">&gt;Game" than anything else . . .</a><br>

<p>
Perhaps you also have a stronger than average memetic immune system. Anyway,
it seems unlikely to me that you'd ever put any faith in extropic popery (or
popish extropy?). I admire your ability to transcend religious memes.
