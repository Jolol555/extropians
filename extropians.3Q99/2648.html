<a name="2674qlink1"><a href="2643.html#2648qlink1">&gt; Most people would call me socialist for bringing this up but I think</a><br>
<i>&gt; it is both socialist and capitalist.</i><br>
<i>&gt; The idea is:</i><br>
<i>&gt; Free Medical &amp; Dental</i><br>
<i>&gt; Free Education</i><br>
<i>&gt; Free Housing</i><br>
<i>&gt; Anything else you want you can buy.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; The idea is by helping your neighbor you increase your own chance for </i><br>
<i>&gt; survival.  Anyone for this? Against It? Any ideas on how it would work?</i><br>

<p>
Before this devolves into a thread about the "basics" of libertarian
and capitalist thought, I recommend that you scan the Extropian reading
list for its political works, especially Friedman's "Machinery of
Freedom".  Mt. Friedman's web site &lt;<a href="http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/">http://www.best.com/%7Eddfr/</a>&gt;
also has a lot of good material on it.

<p>
Capitalism recognizes quite clearly that "helping your neighbor
increases your own chance for survival"; indeed, because doing so
is rational, it is not necessary for a government to mandate it
by force--people will help their neighbors, friends, families, and
even strangers anyway because they derive benefit from doing so.
Indeed it is not at all unlikely that a libertarian community
would provide some minimal level of assistance in the above areas
as a human capital investment, or merely to keep the
underprivileged from becoming a burden in other ways (crime, etc.)
It would not, of course, /control/ those areas as our system does
to a degree, because that would abridge the rights of free
individuals to determine their own desire for housing, medicine,
education, or other services and pay for whatever level of service
they want.
