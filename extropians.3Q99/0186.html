<i>&gt;&gt;&gt; ...if we don't have some aesthetic memory of the dinosaurs...</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;We dont.  Missed em by several tens of millions of years.  However,</i><br>
<a name="0208qlink1"><i>&gt;&gt;if the ancients found dinosaur skeletons, they would be at a loss to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;explain them.  Perhaps the flood legend recorded in the book of</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Genesis came from finding fossils of sea creatures on mountainsides,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;and the dinosaur legends were spawned by the discovery</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;of a t-rex skeleton?</a>  spike</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0418qlink2"><a name="0208qlink2"><i>&gt;Seems pretty unlikely that the ancients would have found a T-Rex skeleton</i><br>
</a><i>&gt;complete enough to give them any idea of what the animal would have looked</i><br>
<i>&gt;like when alive, or indeed any dinosaur skeleton that would have let them</i><br>
<i>&gt;understand that they were looking at the remains of a lizard-like creature.</a></a></i><br>

<p>
It has been suggested that early gargoyle statues were modeled after
_Protoceratops_. They are smaller and more robust than T-rex as well as
being much more abundant. Their head plates are often preserved in one
piece and can look quite lizard-like without extensive reconstruction.

<p>
<a name="0418qlink3"><a name="0208qlink3">So, has anyone seen any gargoyles that look sufficiently Protoceratopsian
that might add credence to this claim?</a></a>
