no no no, not coward's way...  the non-artists way!!! We dont care care if we 
are right, we don't need to be, we are havin' BIG FUN -- just cause we get it 
right once in awhile like Jules Verne, measn we'll try anything!! 
Hey...  you know... we want to shine flashlights on fairies... have you heard 
of a chimera? thats the muse you see....

<a name="4894qlink1">    &gt;&gt;I'd be thankful for any pointers to other artistic visions other than
    H.R. Giger's, though. There should be lots of them.

<p>
Thanks, Gene,  you and I are on the same page, if I was more succinct I would 
have said exactly THAT! ... and the reason why i won't go Giger (and some day 
when you have had enough beer that you won't remember a thing,  I will let 
you look at my cybergirl series which inadvertantly got *very* Gigerish) -- 
his art is in a color scheme that implies rot, death and decay. It's horroe 
genre. It impies pain. And metal. And low temperatures. Of course, he mixes 
bio with machine which is a theme I adore, and he's a friggin' genius. But i 
want lively, yummie, soft, inviting futurecities. 
 That AIN"T giger.</a>

<a name="4777qlink1">Also exoterra work has been done to death. I mean how many 2001's and Aliens 
images can we find? a lot.  But the only guy who uses bright colors is Syd 
Mead.  But he's so god-damn industrial age. 
Possibly Roger Dean, though his stuff is 70's and very *very* retro..." 
Rocks, fish-spaceships, mushrooms, waterfalls, floating islands, soft 
oranges, blues, yellows, greens...</a>

[On a final note: Maybe someday I will understand the science parts of 
Eugene's posts: please adjust your universal translater to the IQ level of 
199.1

thank you]
