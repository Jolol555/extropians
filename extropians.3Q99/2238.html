Abstract
<br>
  AIMS: Fibrinogen was measured in 5095 men and 4860 men aged
  40-59 in a random population sample from 25 districts</a> of Scotland recruited
<a name="2263qlink2">  during 1984-87: the Scottish Heart Health Study. Fibrinogen
  was then related to the chance of fatal and non-fatal coronary</a> events and
<a name="2263qlink3">  death from any cause during a subsequent follow-up period of around</a> 8 years.
<a name="2263qlink4">  METHODS AND RESULTS: Fibrinogen was measured by the Clauss
  assay. The effect of fibrinogen on coronary heart disease
  and death was assessed through age-adjusted means and Cox proportional
  hazards regression models, accounting for age, cotinine (a measure</a> of tobacco
<a name="2263qlink5">  smoke inhalation) and 11 other major coronary risk factors.
  Fibrinogen was found to be an important risk factor for
  coronary heart disease in men and women, with and without pre-existing
  coronary heart disease. There appears to be a threshold effect,</a> with those in
<a name="2263qlink6">  the highest fifth of the distribution having a much increased risk.</a> Estimated
<a name="2263qlink7">  age-adjusted hazard ratios by sex and pre-existing coronary</a> heart disease
<a name="2263qlink8">  group for the highest to lowest fifth of fibrinogen range
  between 1.93 and 4.86. Fibrinogen is also important as a
  risk factor for coronary death and all-causes mortality,
  with a similar threshold effect. Comparing the two extreme fifths,</a> the hazard
<a name="2263qlink9">  ratios for coronary death are 3.01 and 3.42, and for all-cause
  mortality are 2.59 and 2.20, for men and women respectively.
  Adjustment for cotinine reduces the hazard ratios, but</a> further adjustment for
<a name="2263qlink10">  the other 11 risk factors has little effect for coronary heart disease
  events. After full adjustment there is a remaining significant (P &lt; 0.05)
</a>
<a name="2263qlink11">  hazard ratio for coronary death and death from any cause</a> and for a coronary
<a name="2263qlink12">  heart disease event for those free of coronary heart disease</a> at baseline,
<a name="2263qlink13">  amongst men, comparing the highest to the lowest fifth. CONCLUSION:
  Fibrinogen is a strong predictor of coronary heart disease,
  fatal or non-fatal, new or recurrent, and of death from an</a> unspecified cause,
<a name="2263qlink14">  for both men and women. Its effect is only partially attributable</a> to other
<a name="2263qlink15">  coronary risk factors, the most important of which is smoking.
