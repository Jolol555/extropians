<a name="0261qlink1">        That is an interesting point.  The concern with any sort of
psychological adjustment, however, is the possibility of emotional
repression. It is always possible to consciously ignore an emotion and act
around it, whether or not it is a primary or secondary emotion.
Unfortunately, this repression has a tendency to weigh heavily on our
subconscious and ultimately affects our physical and mental well-being.</a>
The question is whether or not we can psychologically tune ourselves to
feel unnecessary\undesirable emotions to a lesser extent without causing
this emotional repression.  As I mentioned in the original post, drugs
don't seem to work (though I have never used any) in
reducing the magnamity of undesirable emotions.  What can?  Or as Greg
suggested, perhaps the whole spectrum of emotions which humans feel is
truly necessary to our well-being both now and in the future.

allure &gt;of technology. We can stay the same old slobs and also live to be a
hundred. &gt;But I wouldn't have thought this had much to do with extropianism.

<p>
        Point taken: far better to be proactive than reactive.  As Gandhi
reputedly said: "You must be the change you wish to see in the world."
