This is mentioned in some detail in Alex Heard's "Apocalypse Really 
Soon."  Personally, I don't find the idea all that repellent.  I think we're
 nearing the time when we'll be able to clone a human body (sans brain) 
and keep it in some form of suspension as "back-up parts" should the 
original, living person need transplants, etc.  Also, in an era of head 
transplants in which spinal nerves could be successfully reattached,
this might be a useful immortalist step (more delaying the "inevitable,"
of course, but better than nothing).

<p>
I published a (in retrospective) rather lame science fiction story 
centered on this general idea.  The twist: the cryonauts who were cloned
weren't made aware of the fact and went catatonic with future shock.  So
the doctors, to protect their investment in immortalist technology, left
the brains in the clones and told them that _they_ were the orignals 
(suffering from some kind of seletive amnesia).
