I was thinking about M-brains the other day, and pondering the fact that
they would probably be highly aesthetically pleasing, if you were that way
inclined. Incredibly intricate, functional, beautiful.

<p>
Imagine super, super, super SIs seeding a world with primitive life, shaping
it toward intelligent life, then to trans-intelligence, singularity, to SI
(still lowly by their standards). Eventually the SIs get to the point of the
M-brain, and start building them all over the place.

<p>
So the SSSSIs swoop in, collect them all up, and pop them in a pet universe
with the others, maybe use them for decorative purposes, or a cosmic game of
marbles. Like we might pop an intricate piece of coral in a fish tank, or
use a sea sponge to scrub our backs, or seed an oyster to make a pearl.

<p>
Still, that's one big vote for our aethetic potential, which is better than
nothing.
