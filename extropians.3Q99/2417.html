<a name="2461qlink1">The many-worlds FAQ states that within the Copehagen interpretation,

<p>
"...the view has generally been adopted that the wavefunction associated
with an object is not a real "thing", but merely represents our *knowledge*

of the object."

<p>
It then objects to this view,

<p>
"This stance means that we can't answer questions about what's actually
happening, all we can answer is what will be the probability of a particular
result if we perform a measurement. This makes a lot of people very unhappy
since it provides no model for the object."

<p>
Hidden variables and many-worlds both share the idea that there's something
else to the theory that can be said to be "actually happening" and that the
fact that our only answer is a probability "makes a lot of people very
unhappy".  Why are they unhappy?  Because they believe that a probability
provides "no model for the object".<a name="2461qlink2">  My interpretation would be that the
probability is no less real than any other explanation.
