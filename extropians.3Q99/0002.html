<p>
I have done quite a bit of experimentation with sleep (which I view to be a
relatively inefficient process) and have only found two things that really
seem to work on a regular basis: exercise and melatonin.  In my experience,
both of these increase the quality and reduce the duration of my sleep.  

<p>
My personal figures for restful sleep:

<p>
Uninterrupted, without melatonin/exercise:  8-10 hours
Uninterrupted, with melatonin/exercise:  6-8 hours
Sustainable interrupted, without melatonin/exercise:  6-8 hours
Sustainable interrupted, with melatonin/exercise:  5-6 hours

<p>
I save about two hours on average and can get by without significant
performance degradation on about 5 hours of sleep if I get adequate levels
of exercise and melatonin (3-6mg).  I imagine this varies widely for
different individuals; I've known people who only needed 3-4 hours of sleep
a night without any external aid.
