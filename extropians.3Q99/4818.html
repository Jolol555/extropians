&lt;&lt;  There is one thing, though, I could not tolerate in a nan-city, which
 would be lack of production and industry.  Given such possibilities as are
 manifested by nanotech, it might become easy to revel in the "present" when
 that time comes.  However, my nan-city would have to be a productive one,
 using technology to push all envelopes forward.  In fact, the ideal city
 (for me) would be less a city than a spacecraft to explore the galaxy.
 That is the beauty of our future: one day, science will be so like art, and
 art so like science, that it will be impossible and superfluous to
 distinguish one from the other.

That statement sounds nice.

<a name="4949qlink1">I find this post interesting, and perhaps on some level, it should strike me 
as admirable, --  coming from the strong puritan work ethic background as I 
do.Productivity. I live for that.

Yet I do not understand. Why could you either tolerate or not, the 
productivity of a society that needed to produce nothing to survive? Or more 
specifically *how* could you? What about the zen aspect of just being, if 
that in itself was the art?<a name="4895qlink1"> Creating a nice environment may become the Zenith 
of civilization. Good sounds, good smells, good air, good light, soft 
couches, beauty all around you, robust objets d'art, polite conversation, 
lovemaking and sweet talk... HEY!   just what the hell is wrong with 
'"reveling in the present"? Isn't  that why we produce, to grab a few 
precious moments of *just that*?

 Manicured Aesthetics becoming the focus of life... I like</a> it!

<p>
Hmph.

<a name="4895qlink2">And why do people want to own their own cities, or am I reading this wrong... 
Anders playfully  suggested a Muse city, and I go quite uncomfortable -- 
since I have no experience in city planning and have seen the botched up jobs 
of people who *do*...</a>

<p>
I just want to paint pretty brightly colored pictures of cool looking organic 
post-nan cities.. I'm gonna go to an art show, call my dearest friend and 
chat, and then spend the weekend looking at Roger Dean Postcards and reading 
about nan...
