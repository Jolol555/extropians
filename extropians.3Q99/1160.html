<a href="1159.html#1160qlink1">&gt; &gt; Of course ignoring for the moment that automated searches will</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; exclude sites that contain these terms in order to ridicule them,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; and that "immortality" would block much of ExI, Alcor, and other</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; such sites, that's good start on a list.  You can also add anything</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; that claims to "boost/support the immune system", "melt fat",</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; "increase energy" or any site that supports iridology, applied</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; kinesiology, ayurvedic medicine, therapeutic touch, "straight"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chiropractic, and many other long-established frauds.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Are you claiming that all chiropractors are quacks?</i><br>

<p>
No, just all "straight" chiropractors.  Straight chiropractors
are those who do nothing but spinal manipulations, and do them to
treat organic disease.  Straight chiropractors openly reject the
germ theory of disease in favor of the idea that subluxations of
the spine cause everything.  They also encourage their patients
to get regular treatments for no reason, even for children.

<p>
Most modern chiropractors are more enlightened, and will use
spinal manipulation to treat back/neck/head pain, where it has
shown some effectiveness, but will resort to more traditional
medicine when it is appropriate.

<a name="1180qlink1">In fact, I went to a chiropractor once myself when I fell
playing basketball.  I just wanted to see if I cracked a rib
seriously enough to warrant attention, but didn't want to go
through all the mountain of paperwork and hassles of my PPO,
so I just walked into a chiropractor's office, told him I
wanted an Xray, slipped him a few bucks and got it done.  I'm
all for deregulation.</a> :)
