Imagine the following:

<p>
<a name="3027qlink1">Welcome to Union Carbide High School, home of the UCHS Gassers...</a>
because we care.
<br>
Tonite our team is playing the boys of the Mighty Lockheed Bombers,
visiting from Ground Zero Stadium...

I am all for competition and merit in student acheivement, and no
mainstreaming. I am especially for competition and merit among teachers
(break the NEA monopoly), but pasting a corporate logo on my kid so he
can go to school? Thats the kind of irresponsible idea that the morons I
talk of in my prior post would be all for...

<p>
My personal favorite is to fund education with taxes on stupid behavior:
drugs, alcohol, cigarettes, pollution, gambling, logging... etc. Thus
its a negative feedback effect: the smarter the kids become, the less
need there is for more education... This to me is the optimum way to
have 'price' signalling in education.
