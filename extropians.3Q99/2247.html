<a href="1843.html#2247qlink1">&gt;Wouldnt it be cool if you could temporarily switch orientation?  I would</a><br>
<i>&gt;like to take a gay pill, that only works until one takes a straight pill</i><br>
<i>&gt;to counteract it.  It would help me to understand my friends who are gay.</i><br>
<i>&gt;A million questions could be answered, such as:</i><br>

<p>
This would be good.  But taking the pill wouldn't answer all your
questions.
<br>
I want a way to piggyback into someone else's mind.  To understand the
gay life from inside the brain of someone who has lived that way for 
decades.

<p>
Other beings I'd like to understand from the inside:  women, lesbians,
nuns, seasoned warriors, hit men, the Dalai Lama, my daughter's rabbit,
an ET, Koko the gorilla, fat people, little people, blacks, a dictator,
my friends and family, Stephen Hawking, a humpback whale, the blind, an
SI, an AI, ....

<p>
As interim substitutes, I read books and strike up conversations with
people (and animals, I suppose) wherever I go.

	Read Quantum Reprogramming by Robert Anton Wilson. Its all just
metaprogramming, really. If you project yourself into someones shoes
with enough veracity (as you have been doing all your life with the
cultural browser imprinted on you)  you slowly start to become the role
you play. And it strikes me that being homosexual, bisexual, polysexual
etc is all an important evolutionary step in advancing the species
through diversification. 'Bridges' like in Greg Egan's Diaspora. Nature
doesn't have the limited predujuces humans have...

			Enclosed&gt; a lil' fiction/article I wrote for a magazine over here in
Oz called TRM (Tekno Renegade Magazine) ((Mr Broderick, would you care
for an interview???)) relevant to all this Transhumanist sexuality talk.
Thanks to Natasha, too, whom I quoted. I KNOW you're all goiing to shoot
down the Reichian stuff but hey, it's all grist for the mill...

	You breathe in deeply, all senses turned on as Poly comes in naked
</pre>
through the afternoon haze, sunlight glistening on hir skin, chest
beating fast  with anticipation. Hir HEDONY SHEATH is mounted with extra
sets of finely moulded bio-tek plastic dildos and genitalia with
lifelike grips, grown from the pleazure vats of Fredricks of Hollywood.
S/He is so very beautiful, radiating a relaxed aura of sensual arousal
like a budding flower about to burst. High up above, the clouds are
billowing in shifting erotic tapestries like scenes from the Kama Sutra;
arms, legs, faces, genitals all lock together in shifting mandalas of
passion. You feel so very horny.  Poly leans in close and you can smell
hir new perfume,  FOXY, a  fine  N,N-5methoxy-Diisopropyltryptamine
pheremone mist genetically designed to stimulate the central nervous
system  -  the ultimate aphrodisiac.  Colours deepen as everything takes
on a richer quality. Everything  feels  hypersensitive like satin sheets
rubbing together, sparking electricity.  The surface moisture of your
bodies presses you together into one skin, hearts beating fast as the
FOXY washes through . Tactile sensation melts  like dreamfloss and hot
showers,  tingling, buzzing, kundalini rising, blood sugar magik&gt;

	“The new sexual landscapes will bring about different types of
sexuality, different types of genders. In the future, we may still want
to perform the traditional types of sex—meaning rubbing mucus membranes
against one another—or we may want to participate in the reconstituted
and reconfigured gender roles and sexuality that will radically change
us.  We will alter aspects of our brains and switch genders by
augmenting "direct route gender swaps" for easy access and quick fix
gender changes. Sex and somatic gender identity are not so immutable. 
In society today there are bisexuals, transsexuals, homosexuals,
asexuals, and intersexuals. Soon there will be negsexuals, solosexuals,
technosexuals, postsexuals, multisexuals, VRsexuals or even just plain
ole’ sexuals who remain nostalgic of the 20th Century. To automorph our
sexuality—to independently chose our identities both physically and
mentally—we are using biotechnology and plastic surgery; chemical
messengers to manipulate our sexual characteristics and hormonal makeup;
and psychological enhancements to help us develop new identity profiles.
The possibility is that we might have as many genders as colors in the
rainbow or as many types of genitalia as patterns of flowers.”

	“I want to fuck,”  Poly groans, tweaking a flushed  red nipple between
hir fingers. Hirs or yours it all blurs into one elongated smear , like
a thousand lotus petals opening to the sun.  Even hir breath is
beautiful.  You sit with the sunshine warming your bodies and cross
reference your SKINS pleazure centers,  automatically tagging G-Spots
and arousing them as you go, trackpads on fingertips tracing the descent
of  your lust.   One caresses breasts and another places their linga
into one’s yoni pot. At the base of hir spine you finger a polymorph
genitalia hub  grafted on like a daisy chain plug, instantly expanding 
gender options.  The finger comes away with a blue tinge as liquid
Orgone feedback opens the chakra pathways.  The Jade Stalk rapidly gains
the four attainments as colours spill along the royal road of Kundalini.
There the Devi or goddess is coiled up three and a half times at the
base of the spine.  It unfolds into a full-blown golden flower that
grows fuller and fuller. You are twining together like candlesticks
melting, negative spaces sparking, locked in an ourobous loop.  
Unfolding, you enter Sushumna, the bliss of cosmic orgasm. Shiva is
united with Shakti. White light causes the universe to disappear.

	“Carnal existence -- that is, the phase of be-ing when we are alive in
a physical body -- is the soul's greatest opportunity. Between a man and
a woman [or other gender designates] mindful of the sacred erotic, the
Vital Life Force -- expressing its ceaseless tendency to be -- is free
to expand the unseparated part, or the energy we know as godhead, within
the physical instrument of each individual, enlarging the soul and its
ability to enact divinity. Such coupling enables the two to consist
together as one perfect be-ing. This expansion, or blossoming in
ecstatic union, is a true expression of what the ancients knew as the
Secret of the Golden Flower. It is the most attainable of paths to a
divine state and demonstrates how love is -- both literally and
figuratively -- the very force and nature of the universe.”  (The Secret
of the Golden Flower,  a Chinese Book of Life, translated and explained
by Richard Wilhelm, with a European commentary by C.G. Jung)
Psychologist Willaim Reich, a student of Freud, called it  ‘ORGONE
ENERGY’: “Primordial Cosmic Energy; universally present and demonstrable
visually, thermically, electroscopically and by means of Geiger-Mueller
counters. In the living organism: Bio-energy, Life Energy.” Examining
the breakdown of cellular material, Reich discovered tiny pulsating
particles he called ‘bions’ spontaneously forming, which led him to
formulate the idea of Orgone Energy. The blockage of Orgone Energy was
seen as the main cause of neuroses and sickness in the body’s overall
energy template, and accumulating this sexual energy in giant Orgone
Accumulators reportedly helped heal and revitalize the body and soul
(see Wilhelm Reich, The Function of the Orgasm).

	White light fades to grey as the VR interface disengages, leaving you
in a warm spill of wires inserted in the skin at orgone hubs along the
spine. Software fluid pumps along  a microfine mesh of tactile
detectors, hundreds per square inch receiving and transmitting tactile
inphomation to porndatanets across the world.  Sponsor names Telefucker
tm and Robopussy tm burn themselves onto the retinas as the autopoetic
sexbliminal program sheds itself from the language centers.  Ebb and
flow as a showering spark of blue fairy lights dances across your
vision. You’re coming down&gt; WAS IT GOOD FOR YOU?
