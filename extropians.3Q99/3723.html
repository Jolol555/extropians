<a href="3492.html#3723qlink1">&gt;So, I thought I would throw out a few tidbits from the</a><br>
<i>&gt;Sept. 1999 issue of the newsletter:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;a) Scientists at the Univ. of Cambridge, INSERM and the firm</i><br>
<i>&gt;    Bioproject have developed a drug BP-897, that has specificity</i><br>
<i>&gt;    for the D3-dopamine receptors (over the D1/D2/D4).  The drug</i><br>
<i>&gt;    appears to suppress the stimulus associated "cravings" that</i><br>
<i>&gt;    occur following withdrawal in cocaine addicted rats.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt;    speculate that this could suppress the cravings that occur in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    other with other addictions such as nicotine or heroin.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;b) A recently discovered 28-mer peptide called "orexin B" which may</i><br>
<i>&gt;    be identical to the separately discovered "hypocretin-2" appears</i><br>
<i>&gt;    to be the molecule that keeps you awake.  Stanford and UTSMC</i><br>
<i>&gt;    groups have separately verified that in dogs with defective</i><br>
<i>&gt;    receptors for this molecule and mice with the orexin B knocked</i><br>
<i>&gt;    out suffer from narcolepsy (falling asleep in the middle of</i><br>
<i>&gt;    activities).  The molecule also appears to be involved in</i><br>
<i>&gt;    regulating appetite.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;c) Two proteins cryptochrome-1 and -2, found which are concentrated</i><br>
<i>&gt;    in the eye appear to be the light-sensitive sensors that mediate</i><br>
<i>&gt;    the resetting of the circadian functions.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;So, we have "cravings", "wakefullness", "appetite" and "body</i><br>
<i>&gt;rhythms" under the control of these little molecules.  I believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;that I may have mentioned in a previous post that leptin appears</i><br>
<i>&gt;to be the hormone for triggering sexual maturation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Since we have only scratched the tip of the iceberg, I think the</i><br>
<i>&gt;people who want to believe "I *am* my own master", have their</i><br>
<i>&gt;work cut out for them in defending, what I predict will be an</i><br>
<i>&gt;ever shrinking set of characteristics, behaviors, desires, motivations,</i><br>
<i>&gt;etc. of which they are the master.  Yes, we can modify ourselves,</i><br>
<i>&gt;but our degrees of freedom are *limited*, until we have the</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies to change the hardware.</i><br>

<p>
True, but
<br>
<a name="3728qlink1">Actualy you have more control over your personality and thus what you do 
than you seem to let</a> on.  It's what you do that differs from what someone 
<a name="3728qlink2">else does in the same situation which we may see some control.</a>
If not "real control" then reactions based from memories that create the 
personality.  Some behaviors such as those the article mentioned, like 
cravings, may indeed be geneticly based.<a name="3728qlink3">  But it's what you do about it that 
</a>
is absolutely not genetic.<a name="3728qlink4">  Also thoughts and experiences do change brain 
hardware.  You don't have to do that with surgery.</a>  Because new thoughts 
create new links you can completely rewire 'parts'<a name="3728qlink5"> of the brain totaly by 
</a>
thoughts and conditions you set up.<a name="3728qlink6">  If you know enough about what kind of 
memories are stored where and exactly what happens as new connections are 
made you should be able to control this rewiring by thought</a> and controlled 
events.
