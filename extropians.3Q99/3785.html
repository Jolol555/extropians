They're trounced because the Companies didn't  decide to test how crops might 
interact sufficiently. Its a healthy reaction that people don't trust the 
"experts" axiomatically. The companies have done an extremely poor job of 
explanation, quite possibly, because they indeed have done poorly in accurate 
testing of whether genes might contaminate other crops.

Its like the mad rush into Nuclear Fission after WW2, to the the Hiroshima 
monster. Extremely attractive venture; but ill-conceived except for processes 
like military subs and deep space probes. Who is to claim that Boiling Water 
Reactors or Pressurized Water Reactors or the CO² cooled reactors are what 
was needed-even though they were pushed by governments? Physicist Freeman 
Dyson wanted engieers to take their time and tinker with reactor concepts, 
letting the Darwinian selection make the most fit choice.  Now we have a 
nearly moribund nuke industry-and a whole lotta clean-up to do.

There's also a cultural factor. Britain seems to be a country enamored of its 
history, probably more-so than any in Europe. So new fangled concepts which 
are not natural, are resisted. America, the land of rednecks and relatively 
high religious attendence also values its technology-go figure.
