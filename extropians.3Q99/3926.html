<i>&gt;physical space for social interaction.  Third, some of the more innovative</i><br>
<i>&gt;ideas for social experimentation we've discussed just won't work if</i><br>
embedded
<br>
<a href="3908.html#3926qlink3">&gt;in traditional social matrices.  Finally, I think some set of folks who</a><br>
call
<br>
<a href="3908.html#3926qlink4">&gt;themselves "extropian" will engage in extraterrestrial "colonization"</a><br>
within
<br>
<a href="3908.html#3926qlink5">&gt;the next 100 years and this means an "enclave", at least at first.</a><br>

<p>
A fifth reason _not_ to consider enclaves outdated relates to the
possibility that the world may plunge itself into yet another total war. It
would not surprise me to learn that some particularly extropic Swiss
citizens have formed enclaves already, with living quarters dug deep into
the Alps.
<br>
Since the best enclaves probably won't invite me, I'll meditate whenever I
can, for as long as I can.
