<a name="3178qlink1">The basic, repeated, complaint is that dynamic, intelligent women who have

neanderthal attitudes:  An assumption that they came here looking for

genetics and longevity.  Having their postings and questions ignored or
overly criticized.</a>

<p>
And so they get fed up, because they don't get treated this way in the real
world. They assume that this must have made mistake in what they thought
transhumanism was about.  So they leave.  And we miss out on their
contributions.

Waldemar:

<p>
I am sure that there are many associations exist in the scientific and
computer fields for women and other 'ethnic' groups.  Those of you who work
in those fields might take a minute to look around.  Also, when you go to
meetings and conferences, try to expand the scope of people that you
approach to talk to.  Find out what different groups sent people there and
try to get to know their reps.
