When I said that a Turing machine had pre-determined state transitions, I didn't 
mean environmental wiring.  I meant that each state transition was predictable, 
given the current internal state and input state.  This is in contrast to a 
machine that contains non-deterministic elements where state transitions are 
unpredictable.

<p>
I'm saying that a Turing machine can display these "magical qualities", but only 
if it interacts with a non-deterministic chaotic system, i.e. our world affected 
by indeterminate quantum dynamics bubbling up through electron motion, atomic 
vibration, etc.  

<p>
I believe human intelligence is Turing computable and doesn't require 
unpredictable, ineffable components. For example, a frequent occurrence in 
emergency rooms is with a head trauma victim that will state something very 
unique to the moment.  But they will restate it word for word every ten minutes 
as if they just realized it.  Like their software is going, "If these conditions 
exist then output this phrase."  Watching this, the mystical qualities of 
intelligence and free will seem to disappear and you are left with a robot.

<p>
So what happened to the magical qualities we associate with sentience if we are 
completely predictable?  They come from our environment, the robot always 
responds to the input from the chaotic system in a predictable manner, but this 
response causes the system to produce a new unpredictable input.  I think 
something happens in the combination of the absolute predictability of the 
Turing machine, and the absolute undeterminability of our world at the quantum 
level.
