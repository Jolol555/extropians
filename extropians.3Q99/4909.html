Keith:

<p>
I read the brief on your certiorari petition with great interest.  Although
I'm no First Amendment specialist, I have had the good fortune to brief cert
to the Supremes once before, and therefore have an eye for the kind of
meticulous quality that ought to be the standard in that forum.  You always
have a sort of "message in a bottle" feeling when you go through this process
<br>
. . . but I can say you've got a very well-formed bottle!  My compliments to<br>
your counsel.  Getting an invitation to file a brief from the clerk after
your petition is filed is always a good sign . . .

<p>
Having read the brief, all I can say is, if that ain't "fair use", I don't
know what is -- Good luck !
