&gt;&gt; To date, nerve regeneration has only
&gt;&gt; been conducted on laboratory animals.
&gt;&gt; But Proneuron expects to begin phase
&gt;&gt; one clinical trials on humans before
&gt;&gt; the end of the year, after the U.S.
&gt;&gt; Food and Drug Administration gives the
&gt;&gt; go-ahead.

<a href="4061.html#4086qlink2">&gt; This looks to me like an under-reported</a><br>
<i>&gt; story. With nerve regeneration of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; human spinal cord, full body transplants</i><br>
<i>&gt; become possible (and Chris Reeves can</i><br>
<i>&gt; play Superman again, and again, and again).</i><br>

<p>
And we'll have the means to the most effective life-extension
method ever! Brain-regeneration would be the only thing left to
figure out. (And stem-cell injection will go along way towards
that goal.)

<p>
<a href="4061.html#4086qlink3">&gt; Too bad the FDA will probably ditch the</a><br>
<i>&gt; project in the US.</i><br>

<p>
Eh? Why would the FDA ditch the project? Anti-Semitism?
(Proneuron is Israeli.) That don't make no sense. The FDA itself
is run by Jews (since it's part of Z.O.G., Zionist Occupation
<a name="4129qlink1">Government), and is integral in Jewish attempts to increase the
power of the UN, which will soon allow Jewish-run businesses
greater access to foreign markets, Christian babies, etc., etc.,
etc.

<p>
I don't know. That's what my militia leader says.

<p>
Seriously, why would the FDA ditch the project?

<p>
Best,
<br>
Brian.
