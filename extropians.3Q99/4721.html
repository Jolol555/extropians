An excerpt from an internal e-mail, from my company's Y2K manager:

<p>
	PLN, Indonesia's national electricity board, was recently asked by
an Indonesian newspaper about its Y2K preparedness. The reply is a gem:
<pre>
		"We can observe what happens (at midnight 1999) in Western
		Samoa, New Zealand and Australia and still have 6 hours to
		make plans."

</pre>
<p>
Apart from the obvious problem with this approach (ie, you actually need
seven hours to make plans and several years to implement them), (*name
withheld*) was quick to point out that Western Samoa is on the other side of
the international dateline.
