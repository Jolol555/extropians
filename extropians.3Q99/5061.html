Interesting. I would be interested to find out who did that. I state
that I did not do that.

<a href="5032.html#5061qlink2">&gt; Attempts have been made to have moderated discussions of guns and gun</a><br>

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<p>
Yes it does. However in my experience it is frustratingly difficult to
have rational discussions with people who have unreasoning fears of
inanimate objects, no matter WHAT that inanimate object is. Consider the
typical anti-gun advocate on tv exhibits such behavior, which in all
fairness may be simply due to a ferverent beleif in their cause. Then
again, most tyrannies start from those with ferverent beliefs exploiting
an unreasoning fear in some part of the population....

<p>
 While the typical definition of insanity is a state of mind that is out
of touch with the normal state of mind, what do you do when the alleged
normal person's state of mind seems to be filled with unreasoning fears
of inanimate objects? Is the norm to be judged to be insane? The same
was once said of the population of Germany.
