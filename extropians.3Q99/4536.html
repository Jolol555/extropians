Hi!

I'm presently subscribed to 5 (7, if you count 2 from which I rarely
receive any e-mails) mailing-lists and this one is the worst.

<i>&gt;certainly not from an address signed up to the list.  And if it is, that</i><br>
<i>&gt;address could be deleted from the subscription list.</i><br>

<p>
Answering your question, yes. As I said in my previous e-mail, some good
programming in the listserver and this problem would be finished.

<p>
Hasta.
