Actually it is called a "chord keyboard" and if you search on that
phrase you will find many hits.  These keyboards are popular among
wearable computer users as they can be used while leaving one hand free.
I saw a guy with one at a party at Max's house seven or eight years ago;
he had a "Private Eye" LED based viewer device, the chord keyboard, and
various PC components in a wide belt he could strap around his belly.
It was somewhat cumbersome cummerbund but if you added a wireless net
connection it could be a pretty nice system.
