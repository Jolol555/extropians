Koza says his recent 1 knode Beo cluster is well below saturation with
a single FastEthernet NIC (and they probably have bottlenecks in their
tree of switches), so an GA running on a sea of xDSL machines across
country might be not that silly after all. (If any distributed.net
people are listening, please email me).

<p>
A "GP-crashme" client could be created around <a href="http://www.bochs.com/">http://www.bochs.com/</a> as
point of departure. Once coredumping rarely, the system could run
natively. Alas, the Windoze versions will always have to run in a
sandbox, thus limiting search space speed.
