<p>
As a non american I'd like to give my opinion on why several people from several
countries hates the USA, it is in part because the USA loves to stick their noses
where they shouldn't, or when they feel they have the right to control technology

<p>
even tho sometimes it's necesary (I'd be afraid if saddam hussein had access to
ultra techs).

<p>
But it also hinders technological development in other countries, and that's not
good
<br>
for example the Mac g4 is banned in 50 countries because it reaches the
supercomputer category, and 128 bit encryption technology is banned in the whole
world (except for the usa and canada).

<p>
Another thing that makes people hate the usa, is that they sometimes are unfair
and tyranical with other countries, (but not just the usa) the problem is that
the US is the country the gathers the most attention by the media.
