<a name="0733qlink1"><a href="0718.html#0721qlink1">&gt;"...laughing my ass off" is the rest of the acronym.  We're not</a><br>
<i>&gt;ignoring the evidence, there just isn't any.  None.  Zero.  </i><br>

<p>
You're wrong.  The evidence is not even limited to the Face, and I consider 
the Face as evidence since it has some most unusual features that have yet to 
</a>
<a name="0733qlink2">be accounted for geologically.  Plus, its extremely high degree of symmetry 
and orientation (a perfect match for at least four other really weird 
landforms in the same region--one of which looks like another face!) argue 
for a _possible_ non-natural origin.  No one's claimed that there</a> is the word 
<a name="0733qlink3">"ARTIFICIAL" engraved on the Cydonian sands, along with the Martian 
equivelent of the Pioneer plaque.  But there are some real oddities there, 
nonetheless--and how will we be able to live with ourselves</a> intellectually if 
<a name="0733qlink4">we ignore all of this because it's too "far out"?

<p>
<a name="0770qlink1"><a href="0718.html#0721qlink2">&gt;The only thing going on here is that there's a rock on Mars that kinda</a><br>
<i>&gt;looks like a face.  So what?  I have a potato that kinda looks</i><br>
<i>&gt;like Jay Leno.  </i><br>

<p>
This is old stuff.  What makes the Mars face unique from any known 
terrestrial landform is that it looks like a face from any viewpoint,</a> whether 
<a name="0733qlink5">from orbit or from the surface of Mars.  This implies, but does not prove, 
design.  All of the terrestrial analogs (Jesus in a tortilla, etc.)</a> don't fit 
<a name="0733qlink6">this criteria, and aren't really in the same league, as far</a> as mysteries go.
</a>

<p>
<a name="0733qlink7"><i>&gt;The originator of this nonsense is Richard Hoagland,</i><br>
<a href="0718.html#0721qlink3">&gt;who richly deserves the "crackpot" title because he spent years</a><br>
<i>&gt;hawking this as a great discovery and spreading the "experts are</i><br>
<i>&gt;supressing the evidence" meme and other lunacy.  </i><br>

<p>
Hoagland is indeed a "crackpot"--at least by my definition.  He didn't used 
to be, but that's another matter.  But should science suffer because one of 
the original players went off the deep end?  

<p>
<i>&gt;Of course Sagan called for more research--he'd say anything to beg for more </i><br>
</a>
<a name="0733qlink8"><a href="0718.html#0721qlink4">&gt;money.  But even he didn't take it seriously.</a><br>

<p>
Probably not.  Though since his endorsement appeared in "The Demon-Haunted 
World," I'm not sure money was a motivating factor.  He was</a> simply interested 
<a name="0733qlink9">in Mars (an understatement, to be sure) and realized that to deny a 
_testable_ hypothesis because it didn't fit neatly into</a> the current paradigm 
<a name="0733qlink10">was irresponsible.  Keep in mind that Sagan wasn't always so hostile to the 
idea of alien civilizations in Earth's proximity as he was in his</a> later years.

<p>
<a name="0733qlink11"><a href="0718.html#0721qlink5">&gt;We'd all be thrilled with some real evidence of life on Mars, as</a><br>
<i>&gt;I'm sure many of us were with the discovery of polycyclic aromatic</i><br>
<i>&gt;hydrocarbons in that meteorite last year.  /That's/ worth study.</i><br>

<p>
You bet it is.

<p>
<a href="0718.html#0721qlink6">&gt;A funny shaped rock is just a funny shaped rock. </a><br>
</a>

<p>
We don't know that yet.
