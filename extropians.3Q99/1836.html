I second this!  From my observations, an Extro conference would be
about the most difficult thing to organize.  Look at us, my friends:
we tend to be a motley group of lone wolves.  I suspect that few
of us are joiners.  Look in the mirror provided by our posts.

<p>
Telling evidences:


<UL>
  <li>  the difficulty we had in making spontaneous meetings happen Fri eve
  <li>  the results of the personality tests we took about a year ago (xNTx's)
  <li>  the fact that many extropians are computer types, classic non-joiners
  <li>  that many of the participants that I have just generalized as non-joiners
    feel no injury whatsoever at being thus characterized (none intended)
<a name="1838qlink1">  <li>  that altho nearly every person there could easily qualify for Mensa,</a>
    I suspect not one single extropian there is an active Mensan (right?)


</UL>
<p>
Organizing Extro4 would be harder than herding cats.  Max and Natasha,
my hat is off to you.  spike
