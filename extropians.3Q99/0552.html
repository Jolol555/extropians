<p>
 This means that we must reconsider the possibility of divine
intervention throughout history.  This is an historically unproductive
tactic but it is the inescapable consequence of considering that we live
in a universe fully populated with superintelligences.

<p>
There is a distinction between what people will understand when you talk of
<br>
"divine intervention" as opposed to "the work of an SI". Try telling a<br>
religious person that their God is an Alien, or an SI. They won't have it.
Religion is not concerned with reality, in fact it's central purpose is to
take the human focus off of reality and on to a much easier to handle
<br>
"faithful dog" scenario. There goes fear of death, there goes "What is the<br>
universe/we for?" , there goes injustice, and there goes moral
responsibility (e.g. "The God says chop up those kids with a machete, let's
do it, he's always RIGHT").
<br>
This is why the divine intervention view is historically unproductive, as
opposed to scientific speculation that involves highly advanced
civilisations. I wouldn't confusethe two - the latter could shine light on a
great many mysteries, whether or not our theories eventually turn out to be
100% correct or not.

<p>
Rob.
