Spike, you're in luck! There's this technology called... reading fiction.
Has its limitations, but some of the content seems to port across gender
and related lines. (Although I still tend to fall over in a maidenly swoon
when I read Chip Delany's [fictive?] accounts of swallowing amounts of piss
and poo in such novels as THE MAD MAN...)

<a name="4143qlink1">Well, several of my old galfriends know, because they switched. But I
haven't got far in conversations with them about it. Guess you had</a> to be
there.
