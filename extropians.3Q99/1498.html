  Of course, I could say that it is not true that AI researchers want us
dead, but that little detail is insignificant.  I agree that there will be
great fear but I think there are a number of things that will give AI a
benefit over GM crops:


<OL>
  <li>  Much greater economic potential.  While a full blown AI may make us
obsolete, the intermediate steps will make us rich.  The people railing
against GM crops are overfed busybodies whose food bill is such a trivial
portion of their income that they can afford to give up the savings of GM
crops without any noticeable harm to their expendable income.  AI
research will produce considerably more noticeable wealth.

  <li>  Faster pace of change.  Once AI gets to the point where people start to
notice, it should be moving at a good clip.  GM crops have been around for
a few years now (to some extent) and it is taking a long time for any
legislative action to be taken against them, at least in the US.  Europe
is a different story.  But Silicon Valley isn't in Europe.

  <li>  Underground or offshore development.  AI development could be done in
secret if that was really necessary.  It could be done by enthusiastic AI
researchers rebelling against the tyrranny of the Luddite masses or it
could be done illegally in government labs.  This is obviously a useless
strategy for GM crops.  The benefits of AI can be felt by a small group of
conspirators.  GM crops are useless without millions of consumers.



</OL>
<p>
The GM crops - AI analogy is good for judging public reaction, but I don't
think we can expect the quest for AI to fall as easily as GM crops.
