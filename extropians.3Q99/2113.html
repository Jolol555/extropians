<p>
Absolutely.  But I would assume that by "normal", you mean approximately
the mid-point of the bell curve at any point in time.  Humans have been
getting smarter over the last 100+ years (for reasons that remain unclear
to my knowledge; one could argue everything from nutrition to failures of
IQ testing methodology).  If everyone else "improves", you go from being
normal to distinctly unnormal.

<p>
Happiness is entirely a state of mind, and can probably be controlled
internally.  Success on the other hand is judged by both onself and
ones friends, associates &amp; society.  Though the roots of the perception
of success probably are based in qualities that promote fitness and
reproductive success, they have become somewhat distorted in the
current society.  [If a man chooses to have a vasectomy before he
has children is he viewed as "less successful"?]

<p>
I'm not interested in whether you are happy or successful.  I hope
you are both.  What I'm interested in (as you point out), is
whether or not you "survive".

<p>
<a href="2108.html#2113qlink4">&gt; &gt; We may presume that nature has "fine-tuned" human traits</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to balance "competitive drives" with "social conformance".</i><br>

<p>
<a href="2108.html#2113qlink5">&gt; Why may this be presumed?  See "Testing Evolutionary Explanations" at</a><br>
<i>&gt; <a href="http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/Testing.html">http://mars.superlink.net/neptune/Testing.html</a></i><br>

<p>
I'll read this, but testing things from an evolutionary framework
and dealing with the dynamics of individual and group selection
is *very* tricky.

<p>
I'll argue it from the perspective of "extremes" in "tribal" settings.
If you get genes that make you hyper-agressive, you will become feared
by the other tribe members who will band together to kill or deport you
(this hurts your reproductive success).  If you are too socially
conforming and always defer to other's interests, you will end up
with the poorest mates (also hurting your reproductive success).
In tribal settings, the reproductive pressures will push towards
the middle by eliminating genes that promote either extreme aggression
or extreme passivity.

<p>
<a href="2108.html#2113qlink6">&gt; I don't see the necessity of competition here.  Surely, it might happen,</a><br>
<i>&gt; though there is a lot of competition between members in the same generation</i><br>
<i>&gt; (in humans) and the same species (both in humans and other species).</i><br>

<p>
I always return to the resource limits problem.  We get to the singularity,
some remain behind, some upload.  What process/who decides the partitioning
of the leftovers on Earth and/or the allocation of M-brain resources?
Sure, we all have trillions of times the resources we currently have
but that assumes that we don't expand our resource utilization abilities.
That remains fairly true if you choose to stay pre-ultra-human.  However
ultra-humans (at least some of them) presumably expand their minds as fast
as the capacity for them expands.  Because of the exponential growth,
the guy who starts first (and manages to survive on Version 0.01
of the software he is running on) ends up with the gold ring.
So he allocates him/herself 10^20 processors and allocates every
other individual ~10^9 processors.  You may be happy, you will
be successful (because you can program the reality to look any
way you want it to look), but you *will* be dirt.   I can only
think of 2 solutions:
<br>
 (a) You are very enlightened dirt.
<br>
 (b) You forget you are dirt.

<p>
The final problem becomes that as "dirt", you are subject to the
construction whims of the dirt manager(s).
