hi.

<p>
    well, i got this in my box today, and i dont remember asking to receive 
it. (what, me absentminded?) now, the implications of this that i can see are 
damn nifty, and it looks pretty credible... but their obviously asking for 
money. i guess its just that i had no idea quantum computing was this far 
along. i thought we were still trying to make one logic gate work; last i 
heard we had made one bit flip from 0 to 1, but we couldnt flip it back. o 
well, to quote jr, grok it and rocket:

<a name="4583qlink1">READY TO BUILD THE HOLO-1 QUANTUM COMPUTER

<p>
The completion of the first practical quantum computer is near at hand. The
</a>
Microphysics Laboratory staff at the University of Illinois at Chicago
<br>
(<a href="http://www.uic.edu/depts/mplab">http://www.uic.edu/depts/mplab</a>) have agreed to construct and test our<br>
initial prototype and talk to any interested investors on behalf of Unitel.
Ted Williams of Keele Univ. UK, Jim Janesick, Faculty UCLA and Director,
Sensor Div., Pixel Vision, Inc. &amp; Ernie Brown of Unitel will be developing
the instruction set using HOLO-1's quantum logic gates. Calculations and I/O
functions will be done with radar and NMR techniques.

<p>
Ted Williams, Ph.D., Faculty Keale Univ.,  is a leading researcher of
molecular scanning and has developed a "three-dimensional memory system"
which offers the highest storage densities ever and is remarkably similar
to our system. We have aquired a world class team of individuals to
construct and perfect our internationally patented RGB freestanding II-VI
compound laser lens. Our close hexagonal packed (CHP) semiconducting RF
modulated/transparent superlattice lens will have a similar or higher
storage capacity and is completely 3-D from the gate, i.e., at nuclear
levels within the periodically arrayed superlattice structure.

<p>
Our Senior Software Engineer, Ernie Brown (ebrown@teleport.com) will be
working with Jim Janesick (mypixel@aol.com) of Pixel Vision
<br>
(<a href="http://www.pv-inc.com">http://www.pv-inc.com</a>) to integrate our qubit-holographic language with<br>
Pixel Vision's CCD that will scan the data from the lens. Jim Janesick also
instructs regular classes at UCLA and is knowledgeable of high-precision
optical scanning equipment and makes significant contributions to the
development of the CCD devices at Pixel Vision. 

<p>
<a name="4578qlink2">The researchers at Keele are developing an NMR scanner that can easily be
incorporate into existing computer services. Utilizing current
</a>
magneto-optical technology and the development of the quantum CPU op-code
is included in Unitel's two year budget plan.  The computer's system
software will be designed in conjunction with the hardware constructed at
<a name="4583qlink2">UIC. Once the new op-code has been established it will be a relatively
simple process to modify a software compiler to compile current source code
into executables compatible with the quantum computer system. Initially we
will use a Linux port since the Linux OS is open source and easily
transferred to different computing systems. Since the Linux kernel is not
hardware specific it will fit Unitel's quantum computer like a glove. The
prototype should prove itself as the world's first efficient quantum
computing system, being many billions of times faster than a conventional
PC and capable of storing multiple terabytes of data. When the it is
finished our quantum computer will be manufactured and placed on the market.

<p>
<a name="4595qlink1"><a name="4583qlink3">Companies who ally themselves with the popular Linux operating system
usually experience dramatic increases in stock values.  Market analysts
marveled when SUN Systems stock increased in value due to the company's
decision to release a MS Office clone with an open source policy. The
consensus was SUN Systems' open source policy would be most beneficial to
Linux, which pushed their stock value up. Since Unitel's quantum computer
will need an easily portable OS to start out with, it is unlikely that
quantum computers will be running Microsoft operating systems anytime soon. 
</a>

<p>
<a name="4578qlink1">In lieu of all of this, Unitel has reduced the minimum investment amount to
$1000 in order to create a more affordable situation for investors. The
previous minimum was set at $5K at 1/10 of 1% or 1/2 share. This all boils
down to the fact that anyone that invests a minimum amount of $1K has a
chance to gain much profit in the future. After all, the future of
computing is quantum computing...
