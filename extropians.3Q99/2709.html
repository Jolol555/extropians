<p>
The true high point of the e-mail year has arrived. Yes, it is the 1999
Darwin Awards. For those sheltered few of you who are not fully aware
of the Darwin Awards. These awards are given annually (and posthumously)
to those individuals who did the most for the human gene pool by
removing themselves from it.

<p>
DARWIN AWARD RUNNERS-UP

<p>
#1 - LOS ANGELES, CA. Ani Saduki, 33, and his brother decided to<br>
 remove a bees' nest from a shed on their property with the aid of a
 pineapple. A pineapple is an illegal firecracker which is the explosive
 equivalent of one-half stick of dynamite. They ignited the fuse and 
 retreated to watch from inside their home, behind a window some 10 feet
 away from the hive/shed. The concussion of the explosion shattered the 
 window inwards, seriously lacerating Ani.  Deciding Mr. Saduki needed 
 stitches, the brothers headed out to go to a nearby hospital.  While 
 walking towards their car, Ani was stung three times by the surviving 
 bees.  Unbeknownst to either brother, Ani was allergic to bee venom,
 and died of suffocation en-route to the hospital.

<p>
#2 - Derrick L. Richards, 28, was charged in April in Minneapolis with<br>
 third-degree murder in the death of his beloved cousin, Kenneth E.
 Richards. According to police, Derrick suggested a game of Russian
 roulette and put a  semiautomatic pistol (instead of the more
 traditional revolver) to Ken's head and fired.

<p>
#3 - PHILLIPSBURG, NJ. An unidentified 29 year old male choked to<br>
 death on a sequined pastie he had orally removed from an exotic dancer 
 at a local establishment. "I didn't think he was going to eat it," the 
 dancer identified only as "Ginger" said, adding "He was really drunk."

<p>
#4 - MOSCOW, Russia-A drunk security man asked a colleague at the<br>
 Moscow bank they were guarding to stab his bulletproof vest to see if 
 it would protect him against a knife attack. It didn't, and the 
 25-year-old guard died of a heart wound. (It's good to see the Russians
 getting into the spirit of the Darwin Awards.)

<p>
#5 - In FRANCE, Jacques LeFevrier left nothing to chance when he<br>
 decided to commit suicide. He stood at the top of a tall cliff and tied
 a noose around his neck. He tied the other end of the rope to a large 
 rock. He drank some poison and set fire to his clothes.  He even tried 
 to shoot himself at the last moment. He jumped and fired the pistol. 
 The bullet missed him completely and cut through the rope above him 
 Free of the threat of hanging, he plunged into the sea. The sudden 
 dunking extinguished the flames and made him vomit the poison.  He was 
 dragged out of the water by a kind fisherman and was taken to a 
 hospital, where he died of hypothermia.

<p>
#6 - RENTON, WASHINGTON, USA. A Renton, Washington man tried to commit<br>
 a robbery. This was probably his first attempt, as suggested by the 
 fact that he had no previous record of violent crime, and by his 
 terminally stupid choices as listed below:
 The target was H&amp;J Leather &amp; Firearms...a gun shop.
 The shop was full of customers, in a state where a substantial portion
 of the adult population is licensed to carry concealed handguns in
 public places.
<br>
 To enter the shop, he had to step around a marked Police patrol car
 parked at the front door.   An officer in uniform was standing next to
 the counter, having coffee before reporting to duty. Upon seeing the
 officer, the would-be robber announced a holdup and fired a few wild
 shots. The officer and a clerk promptly returned fire, removing him
 from the gene pool. Several other customers also drew their guns, but
 didn't fire. No one else was hurt.

<p>
AND THE 1999 DARWIN AWARD WINNER IS.....

<p>
THOMPSON, MANITOBA, CANADA. Telephone relay company night watchman
Edward Baker, 31, was killed early Christmas morning by excessive
microwave radiation exposure. He was apparently attempting to keep warm
next to a telecommunications feed-horn. Baker had been suspended on a 
safety violation once last year, according to Northern Manitoba Signal 
Relay spokesperson Tanya Cooke.  She noted that Baker's earlier 
infraction was for defeating a safety shut-off switch and entering a 
restricted maintenance catwalk in order to stand in front of the 
microwave dish. He had told coworkers that it was the only way he could 
stay warm during his twelve-hour shift at the station, where winter 
temperatures often dip to forty below zero.
Microwaves can heat water molecules within human tissue in the same
way that they heat food in microwave ovens. For his Christmas shift, 
Baker reportedly brought a twelve pack of beer and a plastic lawn chair,
which he positioned directly in line with the strongest microwave beam.
Baker had not been told about a tenfold boost in microwave power
planned that night to handle the anticipated increase in holiday 
long-distance calling traffic. Baker's body was discovered by the
daytime watchman, John Burns, who was greeted by an odor he mistook for 
a Christmas roast he thought Baker must have prepared as a surprise. 
Burns also reported to NMSR company officials that Baker's unfinished 
beers had exploded.
