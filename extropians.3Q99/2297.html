99.99% accuracy

	    &gt;the outcome of any action that you might consider,<br>

<p>
	&gt;It could never happen. You may be far more intelligent than a human
but the thing
<p>
	&gt;you're trying to figure out, yourself, is far more complex. You'd
be no better off
<p>
	&gt;than humans are at predicting what you'd do next, 

<p>
	What is your reasoning behind this? You don't offer a trail to your
above conclusion. Because the SI is "far more complex"? And so it follows
that a superintelligence about which we know nothing will certainly not be
able to track the variables in their own system - despite the fact that they
probably built themselves from and as a lower life form anyway ? I think
not.
