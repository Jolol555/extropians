<p>
PS:  If any of my Australian friends should happen to meet him at
Worldcon, two words of advice.  First, Dad is not a Singularitarian, or
even an Extropian or a transhumanist.<a name="2028qlink1">  He hasn't read my Web pages.</a>  He
doesn't know the difference between a Specialist and a Singularity. 
<a name="2028qlink2">Though I tried hard enough to get him to read my pages when they first
came out, he's always been convinced it's just youthful folly, not worth
wasting his time.</a>  (It's actually quite a bit like the selective
memories in _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_; that business with her mom not
catching on for three years is a lot more realistic than you might
think.)  I've changed my mind since them.<a name="2028qlink3">  To your family, you're always
three years old, and that's not a renewable resource.  I don't want to
disrupt it by forcing my true self in on their cozy illusions.</a>  Let's
not raise the subject of, say, true allegiances, or neurology, unless he
brings it up, okay?  Let's not dispel any illusions.

<p>
Second, there are some parts of my life I haven't chosen to share with
the entire Internet, for excellent reasons, so if you should happen to
find out that I'm a green-eyeballed Catholic priest confined to a
wheelchair, can you please drop me a line before you share this
fascinating tidbit in a public forum?

<p>
Feel free to discuss my numerous character flaws.
