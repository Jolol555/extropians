Economics =/= money, necessarily. Substitute energy for money, make 
no assumptions whatever about the rest of the economic systems out 
there, and there's still something to the argument in favor of ETIs floating at 
home with a hot quarkbrew petting the family noogle while the computer 
crunches EMF data looking for replies to their laser-mediated personals ad 
that's sweeping the galaxy, either instead of or in advance of a probe or 
expedition.

Maybe they're shy, and  don't want to touch fronds until they've been 
properly introduced. Maybe they only care about information. Or maybe 
what they sent out was a notice of intent to build a structure using all the 
matter in their observable universe, and they want to make sure there's no 
one out there advanced enough to stop them. In that case, their skeptics 
are probably saying that the fact that they haven't been disassembled into 
the leading edge of someone else's construct means that Universe is 
empty except for a few bands of savages who aren't using the space 
anyway, so it's Outward Ho! and Manifest Destiny ... just be sure to pack 
the trade beads, and if those don't work there's always the nanopox 
blankets.

Or maybe they'll answer if we send them some of Natasha's pictures :-)
