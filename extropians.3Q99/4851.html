<a name="4859qlink1">  <li>  the gun ban was for a month. All that proved was that ExI is weak
enough to bow to calls for censorship among the membership, and that
there are enough members to help found the exi-freedom mail list...</a>
<a name="4859qlink2">  <li>  the fascists and those they have programmed with their propaganda
never tire of thinking up excuses why we should surrender our freedoms,
so why should I tire of defending our freedoms against their attacks?
The price of freedom is eternal vigilance. I've paid that price before,</a>
and I will pay it again.

these people still can't figure out that its people that kill people.</a>
