Research continues to indicate a link between Type I 
diabetes and bovine-milk consumption in infancy. Here's 
a recent report from Science News (1999;155(26):404-5):

Here are reviews of other studies on the possible link:

It should be noted that that study, which 
throws cold water on the Type-I/milk connection, 
was sponsored by the National Fluid Milk Processors. 
Here are a couple relevant studies I found via Medline:

TITLE: Cow milk feeding induces antibodies to insulin in
children--a link between cow milk and insulin-dependent
diabetes mellitus?
<br>

AUTHOR AFFILIATION: Department of Biochemistry, National 
Public Health Institute, Helsinki, Finland.

ABSTRACT: Exposure to cow milk (CM)-based formulas in 
early infancy has been associated with an increased risk 
of insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM), but studies 
on the possible pathogenic mechanism(s) linking CM and 
IDDM are contradicting. We hypothesized that if CM formulas 
contained bovine insulin (BI), exposure to them could lead 
to immunization against insulin, which is the only known 
beta-cell- specific autoantigen in IDDM. We measured 
immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies by enzyme immunoassay 
<br>
(EIA) to BI and human insulin (HI) in children who received, <br>
during the first 9 months of life, either a formula containing 
whole CM proteins or a formula containing hydrolyzed casein 
<br>
(HC) peptides. BI was detectable by radioimmunoassay (RIA) and<br>
immunoblotting in the CM-based formula. At 6 months of age 
the children who received CM formula had higher levels of 
IgG antibodies to BI than children who received either HC 
formula or children who were exclusively breast-fed (median 
levels 0.480 versus 0.185, P = 0.04; and 0.480 versus 0.160, 
P = 0.04; respectively). Also, at 9 months of age, children 
in the CM group differed from the HC group (0.403 versus 
0.230; P = 0.02). Antibodies to BI and HI showed a positive
correlation and cross-reacted in inhibition studies. The 
high incidence of insulin- binding antibodies in young 
children with IDDM may be explained by oral immunization 
to BI present in CM. Exposure to BI, which differs from 
HI only by three amino acids, may break the tolerance to 
insulin.

ABSTRACT: Previously published Type I (insulin-dependent) 
diabetes mellitus incidence in 0 to 14-year-old children 
from 10 countries or areas was compared with the national 
annual cow milk protein consumption. Countries which were 
selected for study had appropriate milk protein polymorphism 
studies, herd breed composition information and low dairy 
imports from other countries. Total protein consumption did 
not correlate with diabetes incidence (r = +0.402), but 
consumption of the beta-casein A1 variant did (r = +0.726). 
Even more pronounced was the relationbetween beta-casein 
<br>
(A1+B) consumption and diabetes (r = +0.982). These latter <br>
two cow caseins yield a bioactive peptide beta- casomorphin-7 
after in vitro digestion with intestinal enzymes whereas the 
common A2 variant or the corresponding human or goat caseins 
do not. beta-casomorphin-7 has opioid properties including
immunosuppression, which could account for the specificity 
of the relation between the consumption of some but not 
all beta-casein variants and diabetes incidence.

Cow's milk: New link to diabetes?

<p>
Some people with insulin-dependent diabetes mount 
an immune response to the protein beta casein, which 
makes up 35 percent of the total protein in cow's milk.
