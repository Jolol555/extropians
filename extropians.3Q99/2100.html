Abstract
<br>
  This cross-sectional study was undertaken to investigate the association
  between the reported frequency of consumption of vegetables and fruits,the
  choice of staple carbohydrate, and glucose intolerance. One thousand one
  hundred twenty-two subjects aged 40-64 years in a population-based study
  underwent an oral glucose tolerance test, and their food consumption was
  assessed using a food-frequency questionnaire. The crude prevalence of
  undiagnosed non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) was 4.5%, and
  that of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) 16.8%. The age-standardized
  prevalence rates were 2.3 and 11.2%, respectively. Frequent
  consumption of vegetables throughout the year was inversely associated with
  the risk of having NIDDM (odds ratio [OR] = 0.16; 95% confidence interval
  [CI] = 0.04-0.69). This association was maintained after adjustment for age,
  gender, and family history. Vegetable consumption during the summer months
  had a much weaker inverse association with the risk of having NIDDM that
  failed to reach statistical significance. A nonsignificant inverse
  association between frequent consumption of fruits and NIDDM
  was observed. Frequent self-reported pasta and rice
  consumption was associated with a reduction in the risk of having IGT and
  NIDDM. (OR = 0.62, 95% CI = 0.44-0.87, and OR = 0.51, 95% CI = 0.27-0.99,
  respectively) but this relationship was not independent of age. Whether these
  associations reflect specific effects of particular nutrients or are a
  reflection of the patterning of lifestyle factors remains to be determined.

<p>
  Additional note by poster:

<p>
   The odds ratio for NIDDM of 0.16 for frequent vegetable 
   consumption is exceptionally low.
