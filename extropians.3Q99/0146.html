<a href="0142.html#0146qlink1">&gt; But the same can be said about any paranormal phenomena or even stuff we are</a><br>
<i>&gt; pretty sure is outright bull.  I mean, perhaps Jesus was resurrected using</i><br>
<i>&gt; Perhaps the apparitions of the Virgin seen in so many places is actually</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotech in action.  This really doesn't clear things up.</i><br>

<p>
I understand your point fully.  The reason I "singled out" UFOs is simply 
because, of all things paranormal, UFOs and abductions are the only phenomena 
that, superficially, at least, appear to implement a _technology_.  And if it 
really is a technology that we're seeing (and it might not be), it seems it 
would have to be a variation of what we know collectively as "nanotech."

<p>
Thanks to [don't remember name...] for the reference to John Keel; another 
name to look up on the subject of paranormal concerns is Jacques Vallee.  And 
the chapter<a name="3676qlink1"> "Theater in the Sky" in Whitley Strieber's</a> _Communion_ is quite 
provoking and cogent.  Strieber's position is that the course of our 
technological evolution is being subtly accelerated by a nonhuman 
intelligence...possibly the same intelligence that beamed information into 
the mind of Philip K. Dick. (Ever read _Valis_ or _Radio Free Albemuth_?  Hot 
stuff!)

<p>
The Jung in me wants to attribute all of this to some sort of projected 
hallucination, but I don't know of any neurological mechanism that can 
produce a seeming phenomenon of such duration and complexity.  My best guess 
is that we're really dealing with a nonhuman intelligence from which we can 
learn a lot, as it seems to be remarkably advanced and consummately 
postbiological.  If so, it's reassuring, since it indicates that a lot of 
today's science fiction is attainable (mind-uploading, nano, etc.).  

<p>
Maybe this is what "first contact" looks like: a very gradual program of 
acclimization in which any given generation of the recipient species doesn't 
know quite what's going on (because if it did, the urge to create might 
slacken or atrophy: there's ample historical context right here on Earth).  

<p>
If alien species really are interested in reaching out to their neighbors 
(instead of imploding into virtual reeality pleasure farms, as some have 
feared), this scenario is actually much in keeping with some of the basic 
tenets of the SETI paradigm.  (Radio waves?  Get real!  Sagan and Drake 
founded SETI on the impossibly rigid notion that aliens, for all of their 
otherwordly weirdness, would have an economic system virtually identical to 
our own, and would thus consider radio transmitting more cost effective than 
building spacecraft.  They neatly bypassed exotic propulsion techniques in 
favor of the chemical rockets we just happened to be using at the time...it's 
an odd, elliptical perspective, kind of like von Daniken pointing at a cave 
painting and saying "Doesn't that look like a space suit?"  

<p>
My answer is a cautious "yes--but a space suit circa 1960!  Why would aliens 
millions of years our superior be wearing this ridiculous stuff?")
