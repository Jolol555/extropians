firm, but as a New York one:</a>

<p>
&lt;&lt;Schwartz believes, in contrast to Kalderon's theory, the central nervous
system of mammals prevents immune cells from carrying out a function that is
essential to recovery. Perhaps, she suggests, mammals have evolved a way of
suppressing immune system activity in the central nervous system in order to
avoid damaging inþammation that could disrupt mental functioning. The
suppression might have a net benefit except in serious injuries. Schwartz
maintains that she has identified a previously unknown molecule in the
central nervous system that causes immune suppression, and an affiliate of
the Weizmann Institute has licensed her system for spinal cord regrowth to a
start-up firm in New York City, Proneuron Biotechnologies. &gt;&gt;

<p>
But the Daily News cites it as Israeli:

<p>
&lt;&lt;Israel's "Proneuron Biotechnologies" company is on the verge of a major
medical discovery in the treatment of neurological conditions. The company
reports that recent tests have shown that its activated immune cell
therapies promoted regrowth of severed nerve fibers, and protected nerve
cells from secondary damage triggered by an initial injury. In the company's
immune cell therapy, the subject's own immune cells are removed, activated
and returned to the central nervous system, where they stimulate healing...
