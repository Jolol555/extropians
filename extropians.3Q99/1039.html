Yes, using numerical probability is always fun and useful to a point, but it
can create the illusion of precision or some other kind of knowledge when there
is none.  If I say the probability of 'Face on Mars' has an ET connection is %5, from
<a name="1045qlink1">where do I get this figure?  Why not %10 or 1%?  Frankly, I don't know enough
about all of the evidence in sufficient detail to even have a remotely precise answer.
Therefore, I take a somewhat 'backseat' to this issue.  This is by no means a cowardly
position as Crocker may have implied, but rather an honest and *precise* assessment
of my own limited ability to determine the likelihood of said hypothesis given my and
even our limited knowledge of the facts.  But since you asked, I'll throw in less
than a %1 chance of there being an ETI connection.  However, apparently unlike
others in this debate that still leaves a small probability that there *is* an ETI
connection! :-)
