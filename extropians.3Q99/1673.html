<a href="1640.html#1673qlink1">&gt;Sf writers, and fiction writers in general, seem to start with some idea ("I</a><br>
<i>&gt;want to show that government doesn't work", for instance - although it could</i><br>
<i>&gt;be less ideological) and then create a world in which this is 'convincingly'</i><br>
<i>&gt;true using whatever narrative devices they have at their disposal.  </i><br>

<p>
When I was at Clarion, Kate Wilhelm and Damon Knight addressed this.
They told us that while it was possible to write good fiction that has a
message, consciously trying to achieve this is almost invariably doomed.
They said if you want to argue a position, write an essay.  It's nearly
impossible to write a corking good story when you're standing on a soapbox.

<p>
As for psi and sf, I will chime in as well.  I don't write much sf these days
but I am a pro.  Until recently, I had never written about psi.  However, as a
consequence of starting to read sf while Campbell edited _analog_, I'd read 
(and loved) much psi sf (from Anne McCaffrey's "A Womanly Talent" to 
Silverberg's _Dying Inside_).

<p>
Then I decided to write a juvenile sf novel (still in progress).  I poked around 
for ideas and chose to write about what it would really be like for a sixth-grade 
girl to develop telepathy as she enters puberty.  I don't believe it could happen
but it's fun to write about, and I'm hitting angles I've never seen done.

<p>
Which is part of the magic.  SF writing is a large room of jazz musicians
jamming.  Grand Master X does a riff on time travel.  The audience applauds.  
Young Turk Y takes up the challenge and gives it her spin.

<p>
And there are separate joys and challenges in writing a story that, while sf,
is accurate and possible, and in writing a story that starts with one impossible 
premise but is fiercely consistent from then on.
