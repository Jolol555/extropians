You're assuming that the development of life is progressive over a 
multi-million year timeline.  That's rather unlikely.  In the absence
of life-like metabolic processes accumulated unformation would 
decay over any substantial period.  

<p>
Life may require a rare, fortuitous combination of circumstances.
In this case, intelligent civilizations would expect to see a delay
time randomnly and evenly distributed over [0,(possible duration of life)
-(time to develop to intelligent civilization)].  I've seen several estimates
that the world will become uninhabitable in about 1 billion years, based
on a) increases in insolation driving a greenhouse and b) recession of
the moon reducing the gyroscopic stabilization of the earth's axis of
rotation.  If earth's life-sustaining span is 5 billion years, and it takes
4 billion to get from initial life to us, the we would expect to see the 
origin of life as a random event in the first billion years.  Seeing the event
at ~100 million is quite compatible with this.

I could muster some arguments based on the speed with which metabolic
cycles must turn which indicate life might have to arise within *hours*
of appropriate circumstances developing, or you'll never see it at all.
