You know, it might prove efficacious - for those of you who are still
having these kind of arguments - to mention that famed (all right,
semi-famed) Singularitarian<a name="4469qlink1"> Eliezer S. Yudkowsky thinks that we have
weird, mysterious, ineffable stuff going on in our</a> neurons, and that a
<a name="4484qlink2">form of uploading that neglected this would be around as hard to miss as
a whack upside the head with a ton of concrete.</a>  If uploaded without our
"ineffable something", we would keel over and die inside the simulation,
twitching pathetically, after the fashion of a salmon whose nervous
system has been destroyed by toxic waste.  Good Lord, what kind of
depressing person thinks our "ineffable something" has such an
infinitesimal effect on the mind that you could analyze the mind's
action on the neural level without noticing our "ineffable something"
written in blazing red letters ten feet high, much less *remove* it
without making a noticeable difference!  The problem with these people
<a name="4484qlink3">is that they don't actually believe in their own theories.</a>
