Well, besides this, we either assume that a) they are, only in ways we can't
determine, or b) we are alone.  Something in the next galaxy over (Andromeda?)
could be as huge as twenty suns and we couldn't discern it.

<p>
One thing that I was thinking was that as civilizations reached some point
where they had the power to alter cosmological framework, perhaps those beings
that had already gotten there would be able to alter their course.  This is
obviously pure speculation.

I think the idea of the Drake equation wasn't so much to give the exact
probability of intelligent life besides humanity, but rather to isolate the
probabilisic variables that would yield some kind of intelligent life as we
know it.  Now, there could still be life and civilization that doesn't depend
on the variables of the Drake equation, for example some form of life that
didn't require a "habitable" planet to form.  So, the Drake equation can't give
us an absolute probability, it is just a guideline.  Sure, there are general
figures for each of the variables, but we cannot verify each of these or if
they are all of the variables.

<p>
Whether or not we consider the Drake equation to determine the probability of
other intelligent civilizations, it is a tool to determine this.

<p>
At any rate, Earth is a miraculous thing.  I say that not necessarily to
require "higher power" for its being, but it is just great.

<p>
Now if the aliens would just come forward and answer these questions we would
be in great shape.  Personally, I feel the universe is too large for humanity
to be the only intelligent race.

<p>
Super high technos!

<p>
Have a nice day, thank you for your time,
