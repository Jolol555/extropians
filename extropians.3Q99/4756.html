<a href="4751.html#4756qlink1">&gt; Well, I suppose you could get an effect rather like a large</a><br>
<i>&gt; shopping mall underground.  But I wouldn't describe my</i><br>
<i>&gt; experience of the cities I've enjoyed most as dark, dank, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; oppressive. I really like being outdoors, in urban environments</i><br>
<i>&gt; as well as rural ones, and if I'm lucky enough to be able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; leave this planet, I'll probably have to give up most of that</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular experience at that time, so I'm not eager to give it</i><br>
<i>&gt; up any earlier.</i><br>

The shopping mall in Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas is totally
enclosed, with a trompe l'oeil ceiling that does a pretty fair
impression of a roman open-air market on a sunny day.  And it's
<a name="4767qlink1">done with mere plaster, paint, and electric lights.  Imagine
what you could do with dynamic display surfaces.</a>  You could
<a name="4767qlink2">probably do a very convincing impression of Eli's savanna, with
birds flying overhead and clouds drifting (without danger of
<a name="4961qlink1">anything falling from either).  A mall open 24hrs</a> with bright
<a name="4767qlink3">full-spectrum lighting (UV-free so shoppers won't worry about
sunburn) could probably even grow real grass and flowers and
trees inside.  The ventilation system would filter out insects
</a>
and insert pleasant odors and adjust humidity.  Sound system
could put back missing low-level noises like wind, birds,
crickets, water.   Could be quite impressive, and should be
runnable on about the amount of energy striking the surface
above.</a>
