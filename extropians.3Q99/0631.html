<br>
<i>&gt;Section 1201(g) of The Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). The topics</i><br>
are encryption research and the development of encryption technology; the
adequacy and effectiveness of technological measures designed to protect
copyrighted works; and the protection of copyright owners against
unauthorized access to their encrypted copyrighted works.
The principal question is: "How will the provisions of section 1201(g)
of the DMCA affect encryption research?" The Register of Copyrights and
the Assistant Secretary of Communications and Information of the Department
of Commerce must prepare a report for Congress, examining Section 1201(g)
no later than October 28, 1999. Comments by the public must be received
by July 26, 1999.
<br>

The Cult of the Dead Cow created and released the program Back Orifice last
year to the general public at the Las Vegas hacker and security conference
DEF CON. The program allows its users to remotely control victims' desktops,
potentially undetected.

Educated people's brains shrink more, but they forget less, study shows

<p>
DETROIT (July 12, 1999 5:11 p.m. EDT <a href="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</a>) - Older
people with lots of education show more brain shrinkage than those who spent
less time hitting the books, according to a medical study released Monday.
But higher education levels also give the elderly more protection from
dementia and memory loss.
<br>
"Our brain cells are dying, but if we have educated ourselves, that provides
a buffering effect such that our functioning remains intact," said Edward
Coffey, chair of the Henry Ford Health System Department of Psychiatry and
principal investigator for the study.
<br>
The research, published in the July issue of the journal Neurology, examined
320 healthy men and women from 66 to 90 years old. Using magnetic resonance
imaging, researchers measured brain size by tracking cerebrospinal fluid
surrounding the outside of the brain.
<br>
The study found that elderly people with 16 years of education had 8 to 10
percent more fluid around their brains than did those who had only gone to
school for four years.
<br>
Coffey was quick to point out the study did not conclude that lots of
education causes smaller brains. In fact, he said everyone's brain starts
shrinking beginning at young adulthood. On average, a person's brain will
shrink 2.5 percent every 10 years.
<br>
Coffey likened the effect of a high amount of schooling on the brain to
exercising a muscle to keep it in shape.
"Everybody has some shrinkage," Coffey said. "We're able to tolerate it to
different extents. If you have more education, the shrinkage causes less
problems for you than those with less education."
Coffey is the same researcher who published a study in February 1998 that
found men's brains shrink faster with age than women's.

Barrier-Breaking Microscope
<br>
Researchers have discovered a way to dramatically improve the resolution of
the fluorescence microscopes often used in biology and chemistry. In the 15
July issue of Optics Letters, they report that a clever combination of two
laser beams can overcome the so-called diffraction limit, which these
microscopes have so far obeyed, bringing finer detail into view.

Genus demos atomic layer deposition
<br>
SAN FRANCISCO — Genus Inc., a leader in thin-film deposition techniques, has
moved further ahead of the pack with an atomic layer deposition system. The
company is currently demonstrating systems that can lay down films as thin
as 10 angstroms, which will be critical in the move to implementing copper
interconnects.

<p>
SAN FRANCISCO — Aluminum interconnects will soon be obsolete. And copper may
prove just an interim step. The next big thing in semiconductor interconnect
technology may be fiber optics. It could take years to find its footing, but
fiber's high bandwidth may prove just as good for moving information within
a chip as for linking high-speed networking equipment.

DNA computers hold promise of massive parallelism
ORLANDO, Fla. — Researchers will gather here beginning July 13 to advance
the state of DNA computing, a field that holds the promise of ultra-dense
systems that pack megabytes of information into devices the size of a
silicon transistor. While some researchers suggest DNA computing is an
infant discipline looking to find its way into real-world applications,
papers presented here at the Genetic and Evolutionary Computation Conference
(GECC) will describe new techniques and tools for building and using DNA
computers.
