Re: Iridium's bankruptcy filing.

The writing was on the wall.  Motorola doesn't know how to
market stuff.  How can a global satellite telco compete
against PCS systems when one is charging megabucks and
the other is "giving it away for free".

<p>
For a look at how badly Iridium screwed up, see J. C. Dvorak's
Inside Track, PC Magazine Sept. 1, 1999, pg 89 or online at:

Read it and weep.  You have to wonder what goes through the
minds of the marketing guys when the price a 75-ohm to 300-ohm
connector for 85 dollars.   They must be thinking that people
who work all over the world are either (a) completely stupid
or (b) have absolutely no price sensitivity.  Of course they
may be forgetting that the reason you *do* work all over the
world is because you have a great awareness of prices and
cost containment...

<p>
Sigh.  I had hoped that global communications might be a
bridge to cheaper/better/faster launch vehicles but it doesn't
look like that is going to be the case.
