You are right. I did misread your post, but having re-read it I am now
unsure exactly what you mean. Why are things so bad if Gore says what he
says? He hasn't said he is pro-teaching evolution at schools. He certainly
hasn't said he supports creationism or thinks it has an equal place in
teaching at school. That locals should have some input into what is taught
at the school level. Would you prefer him to say that government in
Washington decides what is to be taught in every school in the Nation
irrespective of what the locals want?

<p>
<a name="3009qlink1">Presumably the best situation would be to give everybody their money back
and let them spend it on the schools they want. Ironically this would mean
much more creationism would be taught, and far less evolution, but if this
means that more freedom is around perhaps this would all be for the best.</a>

best, patrick
