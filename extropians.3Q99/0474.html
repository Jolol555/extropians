Based on the conversations we had at Foresight in May, I think one of the 
more intriguing proposals for empirically verifying his ideas that Robert 
Bradbury will make in his upcoming presentation on bioastronomy is based on 
the thermodynamic radiation of waste heat by SIs.  As I recall, it's based on 
the idea that completely masking waste heat is something that even the most 
advanced SI can't do and that a systematic search for the signature of that 
heat is something within our current technological capabilities..

<p>
Just a personal comment: The discussion Robert and I had at Foresight about 
this subject was one of the most stimulating I can remember for years.  I 
really don't think Robert meant any disrespect to the SETI crowd with his 
initial post in this thread, but rather, as he tried to explain, he was using 
a little turbocharged rhetoric to get some well-deserved attention for the 
truly impressive amount of work he's done on this subject.  After listening 
to him explain his ideas at the white board and then field questions from 
some of the certifiably smartest people on the planet, I can assure you that 
although he might be wrong, his ideas are extremely well thought-out.  I 
remember thinking that the scene at Los Alamos when Von Neuman proposed the 
idea of galactic exploration with self-replicating probes must have been 
something like that . . .
