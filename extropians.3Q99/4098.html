Boy, all of my predictions from Extro conferences are coming true!
I should start picking horses... :-)

<p>
<a href="4093.html#4098qlink1">&gt; &gt; A US genetic company, Celera, has decoded the genetic blueprint of the</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; common fruit fly. Using its superfast but controversial "shotgun"</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; method of  gene sequencing, it has identified the entire genetic code,</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; 1.8 billion base pairs, of Drosophila melanogaster.</i><br>

<p>
You should be careful with press releases.  "Decoded", in this situation
means *READ*, as in the same way I would read Arabic (I can copy the
symbols, but I don't "understand" a word of it).   If Drosophila remains
"true" to form with the other 60+ genomes that have been decoded that
will mean that 30-40% of the genes will be "unrecognizable" and we will
have no idea what they do.  They you have *a lot* of work ahead to
decode all of their functions.

<p>
They've only just begun to finish all of the painstaking computer
work that assembles all of the sequence information and finds all
of the "putative" genes in the genome.  Where they are now is at
the point that if you gave a Monkey all of the pages of a book
in some random order and told it to put them together in the correct
order and draw lines at the beginning and end of each sentence.
The really hard part begins when you ask the Monkey to explain what
each sentence *means*.  Celera probably will do little of this
interpretation work since they did the sequencing under contract
to the Drosophila Genome researchers.

<p>
The human genome is 23% sequenced in rough form at this point.
