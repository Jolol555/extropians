<a href="0053.html#0122qlink1">&gt; 0. If I can replace the emotion FEAR with a "WARNING: DANGER" function which</a><br>
<i>&gt;    works as fast (=at a low level) as FEAR does, then I would replace it.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;    regard any person irresponsible who simply removes FEAR without replacing</i><br>
<i>&gt;    it with some other safeguard.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0549qlink2">The question is then if this improved fear isn't just fear. The
valence of an experience such as pain can be changed through mental
discipline; maybe it is better to change the valence of fear rather
than removing the emotion (given the problems people with Kluver-Bucy
amygdala damage have just due to their fearfulness, it seems to be a
good idea).</a>

<p>
<a name="0549qlink3">Having a rousing emotion for dangerous situations is useful. The
problem is that we just have a general purpose fear that is best tuned
for physical danger. I think we might have more use with developing
two more kinds of fear-reactions, one for social dangers and one for
purely rational dangers, without all the body reactions that distract
us.</a>

<p>
<a href="0053.html#0122qlink2">&gt;    I have no use for ANXIETY, and would remove it.</a><br>

<p>
Anxiety is a constant low-level fear reaction, and usually not
useful. It might be a good thing if you are hiding in the jungle from
something, since it places you in a constant readiness mode with high
I/O, but in most modern situations it is just pathological.
 
<p>
<a href="0053.html#0122qlink3">&gt; 1. I did not know that humans sort LONELINESS into the EMOTIONS cathegory.</a><br>
<i>&gt;    I believed they defined LONELINESS as the property of a person who belongs</i><br>
<i>&gt;    to a set consisting of only that person.  What kind of EMOTION would you</i><br>
<i>&gt;    suggest such a person senses?</i><br>

<p>
Most people seem to experience a negative emotion they call loneliness
when they feel they lack emotional ties with other humans around them
or are in a situation where they are far from other humans. A quite
natural reaction for pack animals. I think you have evolved away from
it a bit, KPJ (as for myself, I seem to experience it far less than
most humans - I must be a half-vulcanite :-).

<p>
<a href="0053.html#0122qlink4">&gt; 4. I would also remove various irrational emotions, such as envy and jealosy.</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0549qlink5">I think it is important to make a distinction between the desire for
<a name="0129qlink1">having something good that somebody else possess and the desire to
remove the thing from his possession.</a> The first state can be
stimulating to achieve more ("KPJ has a wearable! Great idea! I must
get one too!"), but in zero-sum situations it easily leads to the
second, destructive state. So we better refine envy and make sure the
world is positive-sum.

<p>
<a name="0159qlink2">(Hmm, what are the proper english words for these two states? In
Swedish it is likely "avund" and "missunsamhet" - trust the Swedes to
have subtle nuances for envy</a> :-)
