<a href="1650.html#1664qlink1">&gt;   Now, there are some medicinal preparations</a><br>
<i>&gt;   sold by homeopathic companies that actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;   contain standard quantities of, for example,</i><br>
<i>&gt;   herbal extracts...</i><br>

<p>
That's a recent development to muddy the waters.  Since
some of these are effective (side effects and all), they
lend some credibility-by-association to the crap.  There
is a preparation sold by homeopaths called Vertigoheel,
for example, that is supposed to treat vertigo.  It
contains measurable quantities of its active ingredient
(hemlock!), and must therefore be sold by prescription.
The only study of its effectiveness was not placebocontrolled
 but did suggest effectiveness.  I'd be delighted
if it really worked--the only drug that works for me is
Valium, and I'd rather have something that didn't put me
to sleep and make me vapid and boring. 

<p>
I do wish to clarify though that my "homeopathy is fraud"
rhetoric does not apply to these genuine pharmaceuticals;
they are merely unproven.
