<i>&gt; wow, so you are only nineteen!</i><br>

<p>
Yes, but soon I'll be twenty.  Soon I will no longer not be a teenager;
instead I will not be a young adult.  In just a month or so, I will not
be part of a completely different social group!  It makes me giddy just
thinking about it!  I just hope I can handle the transition.

<p>
&gt; I imagined you being in your late fifties at<br>

<p>
Most people do.

<p>
Let's just say that this question incorporates a false assumption and
leave it at that, shall we?

<p>
No, although it does seem likely that I'll just get work as a computer
programmer at some temp agency (or something) so I can do The Job in my
spare time.  Not having a life should cut down on expenses a bit.

<p>
<a href="1597.html#1605qlink5">&gt; Anchorage has a fellow with an extremely high I.Q. that I read about</a><br>
<i>&gt; in the paper who is perfectly content as a heavy equipment operator but his</i><br>

<p>
This is news?  Wonder what they'd make of a mutant supergenius.

<p>
&gt; What is your career goal?<br>

<p>
The Singularity, of course.  What else?

<p>

<a href="1597.html#1605qlink6">&gt; song lyrics you wrote while inspired at a con I just thought "he's pretty</a><br>
<i>&gt; hip for an old guy!"</i><br>

<p>
Oh, that's wonderful!  That really is wonderful!  "Pretty hip for an old
guy!"<a name="1626qlink1">  That goes on the list right next to "72-year-old Brooklyn
grandmother"</a> and "Someone who, if fringe, is at least not completely looney."
