<p>
The National Weather Service used to make educated guesses
at the path of a hurricane and warn those in the danger zone to evacuate.
Those who got those warnings knew it was best to get scarce for a few days.

<p>
A few years ago a storm went off course a bit and some prole who did *not*
get an evacuation warning had his poodle blown away [Totooooooo...], so
in the great American tradition, he sued the gov for several jillion
dollars, won.

<p>
Now, in order to cover their own asses, the Weather Service gives
*everybody* on the east coast of Florida a mandatory evacuation order, 
so of course, no one goes.

<p>
Before the case, only those who really *were* in danger got the evacuation
orders, and off they went.  Now *everyone* gets the order, consequently
one cannot assess the real danger from the warning, even tho the accuracy
of the computer models has increased dramatically.

They

were given evacuation orders.  They all chose to stay.
