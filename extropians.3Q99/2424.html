<a name="2438qlink1">Craig, currently I am still a member of this list and have just as much
prerogative to send my jabber if that's what it is as you do, grow up and be
a kind person instead of the stink that you are...  You are the kind of
person that makes any list a place people don't want</a> to be.  Craig, just
maybe you should take your own advice and check out the standard reference
on being polite and kind.

<p>
<a name="2432qlink1">Also, I have tried all of the messages to majordomo as recommended by fokes
to get off this list, I just receive error messages in return, still I am
getting these ridiculous backbiting messages from Craig, maybe I should turn
you in for sending junk mail to this list.  If there is a moderator, please
remove &lt;21oil.gte.net&gt; from this list.

<p>
Thank you...
