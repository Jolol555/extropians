<i>&gt;  &gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;     yea. ok, so lets say ive got this antimatter clock merrily spinning </i><br>
away,
<br>
<a href="2590.html#2614qlink6">&gt;  &gt; backwards, suspended via maglev in a vacuum chamber. then, to be ornery, </a><br>
i

does
<br>
<a href="2590.html#2614qlink8">&gt;  &gt; the clock respond? does it actually tilt? that would require that it move</a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; forward in time...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;     or am i just picturing your anology wrong, mike? i find this very</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; nonintuitive...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  I honestly don't know for sure, but my intuition says that the clock</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will tilt before you adjust the magnetic field (hints of the old</i><br>
<i>&gt;  thalidomide reaction that Azimov used to speak of) though how close the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  action/reaction will occur I cannot say. The fact that we are on this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  side of the big bang (thus dictating the force of entropy in one</i><br>
<i>&gt;  direction) probably decides the issue differently than in an anti-matter</i><br>
<i>&gt;  universe on the other side of the big bang.</i><br>

<p>
    well, if the clock is going to tilt before i tilt it, then the blatantly 
prudent course of action that is presented would be to not adjust the 
magnetic field that would have caused it to tilt, had i adjusted it... hehe.. 
hm.

<p>
<a href="2590.html#2614qlink9">&gt;  Someone said my perception of this was a misunderstanding, but they</a><br>
<i>&gt;  failed to explain why the Transactional interpretation should not be</i><br>
<i>&gt;  taken as literally as this. I would be very interested in hearing this</i><br>
<i>&gt;  explaination.</i><br>

<p>
    well, as of right now, im not subscribing to the literal transactional 
interpretation because of the tweaky paradoxes it presents. if someone could 
explain to me exactly where and when the transactional interpretation stops 
applying, i would dig it very much.  i understood that the transactional 
interpretation says that although it can, under some circumstances, be useful 
to think of antiparticles as going backwords in time, they dont really do 
that.
<p>
    my questions revolve around the "some circumstances"... help?

<p>
may your clocks never tilt before you tilt them,
