<p>
And if they do adhere to the strict private-property, non-interference
principle, this is absolutely a recipe for a deranged meglomaniac
who wants to *control* all other individuals and subordinate your
interests.  The average man on the street is trumped by genius
level megalomaniacs.   The only defense against this is the organization
(in some way) of the collective intelligence of the average man.

While, those *individuals* who are "control freaks", unregulated by
"external" (note I didn't say central) forces, will attempt to develop
technologies that enable them to enforce their will upon all of the
un-suspecting "Libertarians".

<p>
By abandoning methods or paths that allow the regulation or control
of megalomaniacs or terrorists that seek to make their philosophy
dominant, Libertarians with a Private Property Principle leave
themselves vulnerable to anyone who is smarter who is willing
to take a slow approach to developing an overwhelming force.
If I need to pool my resources with my fellow citizens to create
defenses against people like Stalin, Hitler, Hussein, etc.
then I for one will be doing it *even* if what results is not
*my* property.
