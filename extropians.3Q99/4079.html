Control.

<p>
Do you suggest that ``beauty'', etc., have an objective existence outside
of the neurological circuits of the mind observing the ``beauty''?

<p>
If not, then you in essence discuss the complexity of the knob implementation.

<p>
If you do, then you subscribe to a mysticist world view, in which science
never can do &lt;this&gt; or &lt;that&gt;.  These beliefs have cropped up before, and
they have always been due to human error.

<p>
<a href="3817.html#4079qlink3">|The very idea that a trivial one-note hum could be made to seem beautiful</a><br>
<i>|in the same way as an elaborate symphony, is not only wrong but IMO</i><br>

<i>|we are complex, intricate, endlessly fascinating machines.  Egan always</i><br>
<i>|seems to miss this point.  Rather than losing faith because we are mere</i><br>
<i>|machines, we should marvel at what mere machines can become.</i><br>

<p>
Humans should not let the amygdala rule supreme in these matters.

<p>
The symbological threat to your ``humanity'' by the ``human machine'' concept
means nothing, unless one embraces the belief that machines somehow have a
lesser ``value'' than humans.

<p>
Personally, I perceive no reason to add a mysticist layer to my perception
of the human machine to justify the notion that complex intelligence systems
have a value in themselves, especially the conscious ones.
