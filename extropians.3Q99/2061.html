Wouldn't mind, but the effort would be futile. You say "mind rape", as in, I
assume, the programming of children into the adults' preferred/programmed
way of thinking. How are you going to replace this system? Leave the kids
unsupervised to grow, with their self-made viewpoints unchallenged (as
humans, total oppression and anarchy would no doubt rule the day), or just
program them with something else?
<br>
Either way, I can't see what you hope to accomplish in terms of the well
being of the individuals concerned. People are made to be zombies - from day
one, they search for "THE" way to behave/think.....when they don't search -
they're forcibly assimilated into the current social protocol by coercion
through negative reinforcement (a bollocking). The only important thing,
surely, is that the conscious being is not made to suffer. As they say -
ignorance is bliss. I can remember when, as a young child, I viewed this
existence as a humans-are-the-centre-of-the-universe complete faith thing,
as the majority do now. I was quickly disillusioned by the constant blind,
moronic, self-serving, self-glorifying manner in which humans would conduct
their affairs. It's utterly pitiful. Nobody to look up to, nobody that even
ever opens their eyes. Seeing this makes you sad. There're no two ways about
it. I've had a great many failed relationships with women, bitter at me
"bringing them to my world" - the number one difference between men&amp;women in
this respect being the "importance" that they attribute to human affairs. 
So, I reiterate - what exactly would you program them with? The truth? They
won't thank you for it - or maybe some other model upon which you have based
your life (will only appeal to those compatible).
Let the humans be humans - and pity them. We can't change them to something
"better" (in your eyes) that will be palatable to all those that you attempt
to program - coercion will have to come in, creating misery.
