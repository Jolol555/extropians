Sure, I understand. I suppose I placed this aspect of the question aside
and went with Poet E. Shaun's "prove" in a more austere sense.  I will say
that I am my worst critic, and I am rather a bit of a type A when it comes
to overworking myself to make sure I'm doing my best to achieve what I set
out to. 

<p>
<a href="4787.html#4821qlink3">&gt;&gt; &gt;why is it necessary to attain popular approval for one's own creations?</a><br>

<p>

<i>&gt;&gt;expression.</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink5">&gt;Damn right, Natasha, and a lot of people think artists don't really</a><br>
"work".  
<br>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink6">&gt;I am always hearing "oh how fun that must be"  - fun... hah!!!  </a><br>

<p>
<a name="4827qlink4">Ha!  I can just image you proving to yourself and the world that you are
having fun -:)  I'm having fund, damn it - don't pay attention to the
masterpiece, just think of it as fun!</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt;Why does an artist feel the need to either</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink7">&gt;&gt;Natasha:</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I suppose the same reason anyone would conform or react?  It is not a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; prescribed character trait of us artists -:)</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink8">&gt;Who are you to say what we feel a need to do? I paint pretty things, that </a><br>
<i>&gt;have nothing to do with pop culture, then I blatantly offend stutus quo in </i><br>
<i>&gt;the next breath.</i><br>

<p>
Your response here to E. Shaun is more enthusiastic than mine -:)

<p>
<a name="4827qlink5"><i>&gt;&gt;&gt;And again, what *is* the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;purpose of art?  </i><br>
</a>

<p>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink9">&gt;&gt;Natasha:</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Imagine a world without it?  Can we get through a day without interfacing</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; with art?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4827qlink6"><a href="4815.html#4821qlink10">&gt;Yeah , you might as well ask, what is the purpose of creation, or what is</a><br>
the 
</a><br>
<i>&gt;purpose of expression? (snip)</i><br>

<p>
Ditto.

<p>
<a href="4801.html#4821qlink11">&gt; &gt;So when talking</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;about popular art, is there a lowest common denominator of sorts to</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;determine what people will like or want to see?</i><br>

<p>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink12">&gt;&gt;Natasha:</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; I'm not sure we can group civilization together so tightly by giving a</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;one-liner sound bite to "art for civilization's sake."  </i><br>

<p>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink13">&gt;Enuff said. Except, I would add, where is this question coming from, and why </a><br>
<i>&gt;do you ask it. And what -- to you -- is lowest denominator popular art? </i><br>
<i>&gt;hmm.... for me I woudl say....   Beany Babies?</i><br>

<p>
Lowart.

<p>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink14">&gt;&gt;(snip -- Natasha's good  answer about storytelling)</a><br>

<p>
<a name="4827qlink7"><a href="4815.html#4821qlink15">&gt;And again not to hammer in a point, it is a trained ear that hears the </a><br>
<i>&gt;subtley of beats and the scientific instrument that measures the</i><br>
harmonics... 
<br>
<a href="4815.html#4821qlink16">&gt; and both are important to understanding the beast...</a><br>

<p>
I got some more nails.</a>

<p>
Good points Nadia.
