Subsequent to my last-forwarded article I've 
been persuaded that the Boy Scouts of America
is not a truly private organization, and as such, 
the BSA does NOT properly have the right to exclude.

<p>
This article is quite persuasive in making the case
<br>
(<a href="http://www.infidels.org/org/aha/religion/bsa.html">http://www.infidels.org/org/aha/religion/bsa.html</a>) <br>
that the BSA is not a truly private organization. 
In 1916 the BSA received a Congressional charter 
<br>
(<a href="http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/36/ch2.html">http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/36/ch2.html</a>)<br>
which superceded the incorporation of the BSA in 
1910. Congress specifically defined the purposes 
of the BSA. The article initially cited states:

<p>
  The House Judiciary Committee, reporting on 
  the bill to charter the BSA, cited the public 
  services rendered by Scouts, including service 
  in floods, war-bond collection, and as "an 
  auxiliary force in the maintenance of public order."

<p>
Which defines the BSA as an auxiliary governmental 
agency. In fact, BSA "Explorer Scout" units assist 
police departments and an array of Federal agencies.
I would dare to posit that the BSA was created with
the intent of preparing boys for war-time skills.

<p>
The BSA must do one of the following: (a) renounce 
its Congressional charter and government connections, 
or (b) stop excluding homosexuals and atheists.
