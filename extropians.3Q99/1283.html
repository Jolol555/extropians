John,

<p>
Sorry for jumping in with some suggestions this late in the thread.  I have tried
several of the machines mentioned in 'Megabrain'.  I even owned an Endomax
around 1989-90.  Of all the machines I tried, the Grahm Potentializer was most
effective. However, I've never tried any machines since then.

<p>
At this point I favor chemicals. My current choice is SomatoPro.
Since you mentioned that you're taking some anti-depressants,
SomatoPro also seems ideally suited for that purpose.  I don't have depression
myself, so I can only speak of others experiences.  Either way, SomatoPro's effects
are immediate, and for the most part permanent.  I highly recommend you buy a
bottle and see for yourself.

<p>
Cheers,

<p>
Paul Hughes
