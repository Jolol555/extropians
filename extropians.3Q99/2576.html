<a name="2595qlink1">There are two ways to look at a terraforming discussion
 (1) you believe nanotech is possible.
<br>
 (2) you don't believe nanotech is possible.</a>

<p>
I will leave aside the discussion of "when" you think it is possible,
because unless you fall into the category of "it is possible, but only
in the far &amp; distant future", the benefits that you individually and we
as a society derive from it make it *senseless* to focus your energy,
attention and support on *anything* other that getting nanotech here as
soon and as safely as possible.

<p>
If you believe nanotechnology *is* possible and in the not too distant
future (say 20-30 years), then you should frame the terraforming discussion
from the perspective of what can I do with a Mars Base and/or terraforming
now vs. what can I do with a Mars Base/terraforming after nanotechnology.

<p>
I will only deal with the "what can I do with a Mars Base/terraforming"
*after* nanotechnology part, because the amount of money that would
have to be spent on the development of the rockets, equipment,
habitats, etc. (probably &gt; $10s of billions) that even a simple
Mars Base would require would be better invested in nanotechnology
development (that I personally could derive some benefit from).

<p>
  In summary, what you can do with nanotechnology is disassemble Mars
  in ~180 days.  Eugene is the only person who has raised any objections
  to my planetary dismantlement methods, and so far I feel those
  objections can be dealt with.

<p>
  In fact if you first disassemble Mercury (~2 weeks) or the asteroids
  (even faster but requires more nanoseeds) then your disassembly time
  for Mars drops to 12 hours (because you have the entire solar energy
  output to use).

<p>
The concept of *terraforming* Mars after nanotechnology develops
is completely *stupid*.  It is an idea locked in a framework
of a pre-(nanotech/upload) mindset.  If you can dismantle planets
but can't upload, then you construct O'Neill-type space colonies
that let us all be libertarians &amp; kings or queens of each of
the realm we oversee.  If you can dismantle planets and can upload then
we construct supercomputers in space and evolve into a superintelligence.

<p>
Dyson and many others have pointed out the pointlessness and expense of
having all of your material stuck at the bottom of gravity wells.
Given that we will have the genome next year, if NASA does a single
reasonably intelligent thing on the pile of pre-nanotech metal they
are assembling, it will be to determine concretely what genes are
turned on in cells in response to gravity.  It should then develop
ways of turning them on permanently.

<p>
If you have nanotech (even good biotech), it is likely that
when we send humans into space they will be enhanced so space
is a less inhospitable environment.  I agree however, with
a comment Eugene made in another thread that after you have
nanotech, retaining human bodies makes questionable sense.

<p>
Simple, end of discussion.

<p>
For anyone to argue Mars Base (or worse terraforming) over nanotech,
implies they *strongly* believe nanotechnology is impossible or would
never arrive in the time frame that the development of a Mars Base
(or worse plans and methods of terraforming) could be developed.
I have to believe that the only reason they say this is because
they can do the calculations on how to get to Mars and we have built,
in the past, reasonable prototypes of the machines necessary to do it.
I would counter that argument with the fact that we have equivalent
proof that self-assembling, replicating molecular nanomachines can exist.
They are called bacteria.  The difference between the two areas is
that one area the technology is "mature", being ~70 years old and 
in the other it is no more than 20.  But we are advancing up the
biotech/nanotech/computer "automoton" curves much faster because they
involve smaller and smaller scales, while rocketry &amp; terraforming
involve larger &amp; larger scales.  Since moving around atoms requires
much less energy than moving around humans, the technology development
should be cheaper and faster (given equal levels of support).

<p>
Now, addressing some points made by other authors --

<p>
<i>&gt; From: Gregory Hather &lt;ghather@netscape.com&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2416.html#2576qlink1">&gt; Why mars won't be teraformed for a long time...</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1.  The atmasphere is to thin.  If we tried to add more, it would just</i><br>
<i>&gt; float off because &gt; mars's gravity is too weak.</i><br>
<i>&gt; (surface gravety = .4*earth surface gravity)</i><br>

<p>
Irrelevant, put the atmosphere in enclosed O'Neill colonies.
You don't want the gravity anyway because it is an impediment
to travel.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2576qlink2">&gt; 2.  It would be cheaper to "teraform" the Aulstralian desert or build</a><br>
<i>&gt; taller buildings.</i><br>

<p>
True, if all we wanted to do was have more space for people.


<p>
<a href="2408.html#2576qlink3">&gt; 3.  Space flight takes too long.  Asuming you acellarate at 1 g,</a><br>
<i>&gt; it would take at least 6 months to reach mars.  </i><br>

<p>
Eric documents in his JBIS article (JBIS 45:401-405 (1992))
that using nanotechnology based solar-electric propulsion,
1 AU trips can be accomplished in 17 days.  So if you have
nanotechnology getting to Mars fast isn't a problem.
This method uses 0.8 m/s^2 accelerations which is much
lower than the constant 1-g accelerations that provide
the ~2 day trip times that others have discussed.
Solar-electric (ion) drives (of a primitive design) exist
today and are in-use in space.

<p>
&gt; 4.  There is no infastructure, and no one to live with.<br>

<p>
No, but since you can dismantle the planet in ~12 hours
you certainly could build it fairly fast.  :-)


<p>
<a href="2408.html#2576qlink4">&gt; 5.  Everyone benifits from teraforming, no matter who pays.</a><br>

<p>
Everyone benefits *more* from having all of the sun's power output
available to do matter manipulation or for computer power
(unless someone manages to get a monopoly on the power collection).

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2576qlink5">&gt; 6.  No one on earth will allow the transfer of oxygen.</a><br>

<p>
There is more than enough oxygen in the outer planets in the
form of CO2.  If you have all of the solar output available
you can get all of the material in Uranus out of its gravity
well in 3.3 years.  Giving it a delta-V to get it to Mars
would take a bit longer, but there again you don't need
all of the oxygen.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2576qlink6">&gt; 7.  A teraformed planet may require matenance.  </a><br>

<p>
Thats why you build the intelligence into the machines.
Last time I checked a majority of the life on the planet
didn't need a lot of maintenance (most of it is bacteria).
Molecular nanomachines do just fine if you stay out of their
way.
 
<p>
<a href="2408.html#2576qlink7">&gt; 8.  It is too big of a project for any corporation or nation to pay for it.</a><br>

<p>
If the growth of nanotechnology-based "wealth" (capital) parallels
the mass-doubling time for nanoassemblers (~1 hour doubling time),
then I personally have the equivalent of the World's GDP at my
disposal after 9 days.  I'll be happy to pay to dismantle Mars
but I'll be damned if I'm going to pay to terraform it!
[:-;]

<p>
Now, onto some of the other comments...

<p>
With nanotech, you dismantle the planets entirely, turn them into
self-propelled autonomous solar-sails and let them sail to whereever
you want them.  You have to partition your power between
planetary disassembly and mass relocation but it is probably
quite fast (months to years).

<p>
Of course after you spent the energy getting the mass out of a
gravity well, it seems really silly to put it back into one!

<a href="2470.html#2576qlink9">&gt; In a magazine article (the title escapes my memory at the moment)</a><br>
<i>&gt; terraforming Mars is discussed in some technical detail and part of the</i><br>

<p>
The Comet/water transport idea was from Freeman Dyson's book
Disturbing the Universe, in Chapter 18: Thought Experiments.
It has been adapted by many people.  Dyson attributes it to some
Asimov stories from 1955.  Dyson suggested using Saturn's
moon Enceladus as the ice source.

<p>
<a href="2470.html#2576qlink10">&gt; My timeline may be a bit off from the article (I'm going from memory here)</a><br>
<i>&gt; but as we approach the "singularity" we coudl develop new technologies that</i><br>
<i>&gt; could concievably speed up this process to take a total of a few decades.</i><br>

<p>
Decades my son!?! Its more like months.

<p>
Say we build the first SI shell M-brain layer in the asteroid belt,
because for some stupid reason you want to keep Mars &amp; Venus for
messy, wet, primitive "humans", then you simply leave holes in
the shell where interplanetary materals from Uranus/Neptune are
being driven through.  It gives you lots of Carbon and O2 to play with
in a very short period.

<p>
<a href="2470.html#2576qlink11">&gt; The initial timeline is assuming we use the technology we have available</a><br>
<i>&gt; today. The main innovations that are needed to get the ball rolling are</i><br>
<i>&gt; transport infrastructure (getting there and back efficiently), habitation</i><br>
<i>&gt; (where the people live while this is going on) and life-support (efficient</i><br>
<i>&gt; methotds for generating food, water, air and electricty). Economy is</i><br>
<i>&gt; something I'll leave up to... economists.</i><br>

<p>
Yep and all of those cost much less if you have self-replicating
machines and moderately intelligent software (about dog level I'd
guess) -- here boy, see the comet, go fetch the comet, thats
a good doggie...  [Note that I didn't say that you required
*nanotechnology* here.  To get the costs down you simply have to get
rid of the humans from everything execpt the design stage and the
construction of the initial set of self-replicators.

<p>
It is worth noting that *no* business will ever fund the
<a name="2578qlink1">development of self-replicating factories (unless they have
the patents on them and are guaranteed royalties from the
production).  This needs to be mostly done by governments.
Why?  Simple -- no business will ever build something that
destroys the market for the thing they are building.
No business will make a toaster factory factory because
once you sell the first one, the market for toasters
rapidly gets saturated and you no longer need toasters
or their factories.  Simple economics.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="2470.html#2576qlink12">&gt; The other concerns raised are worthy of consideration but pointless if the</a><br>
<i>&gt; task is too daunting or restricted by paranoid governments affraid of</i><br>
<i>&gt; humanity getting out from under their thumbs.</i><br>

<p>
This is worthy of consideration.  I think the question comes down
to whether the government can make prisoners of you?  If I've got
10 kg of nanobots building personal ground-to-space transport
seems straight forward.   You can bet I'm going where there ain't
no taxes...  The only way the government can stop this is to
shoot me down on takeoff, so if we all do it together they
can't get us all...  [Actually, if they've got nanotech too
they might be able to do it, but I can't believe a free society
would stand for this.]

<p>
<i>&gt; Even if private industry wants to and can afford to do it, current</i><br>
<a href="2470.html#2576qlink13">&gt; governmental controls (especially those imposed by the US) must be</a><br>
<i>&gt; lifted or nothing will be allowed to happen.</i><br>

<p>
I don't believe the government is controlling our "access to space".
Bill Gates and a number of other individuals could afford to buy
rockets to take them there.  Anyone with the bucks can get the
Russians to ferry them up to space.

<p>
I suspect you are referring to using old-style rockets to develop Mars.
If there is a market for it, business can do it.  However Iridium
is a great example of people convincing themselves there was a
space application, installing the required infrastructure only
to discover their market size estimates and pricing strategies
were completely bogus.
