I think, or maybe it would be better not to..
.
<br>
In this case it is maybe pertinent to talk about resources, anti mater (or
matter) would be a credible one.

<p>
Else?
<br>
What is it ?
<br>
How do I sell this information to the average person?
Do I need to change the whole living enviroment to do so?
"Sometimes, here , there is a discrepancy between "salt in the pumpkin",
that's how we say to be smart in Italy and how to make the most out of this
salt, in terms of social evolution".
<br>
Would it be better to take care of my self and then others?
Is it UFO and other unprobable archetipos the only common language ?
I wish I could do something for others and not just to give value to my
efforts
<br>
:)
