<p>
Molecular Biology of the Cell, Third Edition, by Bruce Alberts et al.  
Garland Publishing. 

<p>
Up-to-date, extensive, easy to read, and plenty of references.

<p>
Also:

<p>
Biochemistry, Stryer.  Now 4th edition, I think; mine is 3rd.

<p>
In terms of determining your ability/realistic interest in the
field:


<OL>
  <li>  Get some lab work.  Take some lab courses or volunteer in 
a professor's lab.

  <li>  Take practice GRE Biology and Molecular Biology exams.  

  <li>  Read current papers on subjects that interest you.  Do 
any background work you need to understand them.


</OL>
<p>
Worked for me; I was accepted at all 4 institution I applied to.

<p>
Best of luck, but be aware that the job market for Biology PhD's
is putrid.  There is a decent market for technicians, but 
universities aren't well set up to train people for that.
