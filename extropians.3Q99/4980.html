<p>
("Ankh Morpok welcomes careful barbarian invaders" - Terry Pratchett
describes this very nicely in one of his books, where the traders
really want their city invaded, since they know they can always sell
stupid souveniers to the invaders.)

<p>
This suggests an interesting defence: make the culture and pleasures
of the pleasure city so attractive that any invader will get
assimilated. Resistance is futile - you will be entertained!

<p>
<a href="4949.html#4980qlink2">&gt; I realize Muse that you were making the point that not every city should </a><br>
<i>&gt; HAVE to be economically productive but ironically this city would be a </i><br>

<i>&gt; can just imagine air cavalry units composed of troops mounted on flying </i><br>
<i>&gt; Dumbo's and great white sharks!  Scary!!</i><br>

<p>
Brrr... on the other hand, being productive means different things to
different cities. Pleasure city would produce pleasure, Hell city pain
and glee and Permutation City safety, for example. In a wordwide,
mobile economy these cities would also have the added protection that
people move between them and want their products, making barbarian
invaders impopular among a very large group with enormous resources
when summed together. If somebody tries to bulldoze &lt;fill in suitable
scenic spot&gt; people rally; if somebody tries to bulldoze &lt;fill in
suitable economic center&gt; many organisations rally, and if it is
something that has both popular, esthetic, economic etc value, then
the barbarians would get a very powerful resistance. They better have
sneaky lawyer-AIs.
