John, if you can come up with a strategy that is going to let your
investments fluorish over the period in which the singularity occurs
I would like to hear about<a name="5195qlink1"> it.  Nanotech stands a good chance of
leaving bankrupt most older forms of wealth storage.  If you aren't
alive to manage it, I would doubt you are going to wake up wealthy.</a>

<p>
[Caveat - its distintly possible that everyone is effectively
wealthy in NanoEra and the only differences are those you choose
to perceive...]

If you investigate the Cryo option, you will find that there are some
recomendations about setting up offshore trusts.  I believe there are
reasonable strategies for setting up investment trusts, picking good
fund managers (pick the guy with the best 5/3/2 year average record),
distribute the funds internationally, have multiple law firms watch
things carefully, etc.  If Cryonics were more popular, there would
be packages that you could buy into to do all this.

<p>
Now, from my perspective the really interesting question about
Cryonics, is the discussion about the relative time differences
between two developments: bio-nanotech enabled reanimation and
<a name="5195qlink2">uploading.  It may be distinctly possible that uploading a
deanimated frozenaut may be feasible *before* bio-nanotech
reanimation (or downloading into a new body a previous uploaded
frozenaut).

<p>
Do people in thinking about cryonics select between the various
options I can see:
<br>
  (a) Reanimate using the first available technology
</a>
<p>
      (so I can save what little wealth I have left).
<pre>
  (b) Reanimate using the first upload technology.
  (c) Reanimate using the first bio-nanotech to restore my body/brain.
  (d) Reanimate when the successful reanimation rate is XX%
      (you really don't think these are all going to work do you?) :-)
</pre>
  (e) Reanimate when I'm worth $10^? or X% of the World's GDP.
  (f) Reanimate when the world is dominated by extropians
<p>
      and transhumanists.
<pre>
  (g) Reanimate when the SI-suitors start courting our Earth-mind.
  (h) Reanimate when bodies are bulletproof.
  (i) Reanimate when tanks can be liscensed as street vehicles.

</pre>
<p>
I'm sure some of you have other criteria that might be of interest.
But *how* do you select between these given an uncertain future?
I can imagine pages of legal gobbledygook specifying numerous
conditions for the go/nogo decisions.
