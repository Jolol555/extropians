<a name="3888qlink3">Well, frankly, yes, my answer would be quite long.  :)

<p>
<a name="3849qlink1">However, as regards ethics, it is certainly wrong, ethically speaking, to
conclude that ethics is a circular/pointless endeavor.</a>  I've made this
argument several times on this list before; Eliezer uses a similar
argument as the underpinning of his theory of the Interim Meaning of Life.

<p>
Basically, the idea is this: ethical theories describe what action we
should perform.  So suppose we're trying to decide between action A and
action B.  Let's also suppose that we have an Ethical Theory (tm) which
claims that we should perform action</a> A.

<p>
<a name="3849qlink2">Now consider the possibility that the whole ethical question is
necessarily circular in nature, and that therefore it does not matter what
<a name="3849qlink3">we decide.</a>  Well, the possibility that "it doesn't matter" does not
provide me with any reason to make any decision over any other; if my
theory tells me to choose A, I'm not going to choose B simply because it
doesn't matter which I choose.  More to the point, the claim that "it
doesn't matter" will NEVER give me ANY reason to change my mind either
way; thus, when making a decision, this possibility drops out of the
equation.  Thus, I can always ACT as if (ie assume that) the ethical
question is not pointless, as long as there is some possibility that it
isn't.

<p>
<a name="3849qlink4">Thus, unless you are absolutely certain that no action is better than any
other, even if it's only better from your perspective, (which is a pretty
implausible view to take, IMO,) you should not conclude that ethics is a
pointless endeavor.  And, thus, we can safely assume that the question of
ethics is not circular.</a>

<p>
<a name="3888qlink4"><a name="3849qlink5">Of course, this proof doesn't tell you which theory of ethics is actually
correct, but it does at least show that the project is not hopeless.</a></a>
