<a name="1124qlink1">It seems a little early to me but let's assume you're right and Nanotechnology
becomes possible in 2015 , uploading would be pretty straightforward after
that, I don't think you'd have long to wait.</a> I would consider a mind a billion
times faster than mine with a billion times my memory capacity to be a
Transhuman Intelligence, although not completely "Artificial". A true ARTIFICIAL
intelligence might come before Nanotechnology (but not by much, the AI would
see to that), or perhaps after, there is no way to tell which technology will win
the race and start the singularity, either would do.

<p>
I also don't understand the 20 year gap between the time uploading
becomes possible and the time it's available to the average person.
<a name="1124qlink2">We've already seen a smaller gap between supercomputers only
huge government agencies could afford and machines of equal power
that third graders get on their birthday. You haven't seen anything yet,</a>
<a name="1124qlink3">In the Nanotechnology age almost any endeavor our puny non Transhuman
brains can now consider of could be put into one of two categories,
dirt cheap or impossible.</a>
