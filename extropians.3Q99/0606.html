<a href="0540.html#0606qlink1">&gt; B5?  JMS?   You lost me.  Tie-downs please...</a><br>

B5 = Babylon 5

<p>
JMS = J Michael Straczynski, the show's creator/author
(it took me far too long to get the correct spelling of this name off the
net)

<p>
B5 - I think this show will be stronger when it is replayed in decades to
come. A true artwork (slightly hampered by production difficulties, ie money
trouble), I've never seen a show with a stronger consistent vision. And it's
sci fi! If you haven't seen it, get the videos and start (first the pilot
movie, then start with season 1).

<p>
I think many people were put off by seeing episodes here and there - it's
not Star Trek, the episodes are not individual storylines to be seen in any
old order. Its a strongly ordered 4 season show (plus the less useful season
5), which was conceived in its entirety prior to beginning the project. I
watched most of it at saturation level (about 10 episodes a week, sometimes
4 a night - now there's a recipe for pain), and I would recommend it as
being the best way to catch the multitude of interwoven storyline threads
and be able to follow them through.

<p>
Damn it, this show is a must see! Call yourselves extropians? Extend
yourself, watch B5!

Emlyn, demagogue
