However, a few million bucks might help bridge the gap to profitability.</a>
Those among us who are good with PR/fundraising might consider doing more
outreach to potential investors/benefactors... this guy and others.
Perhaps we should pencil in an informal meeting on this topic in Berkeley
at the end of the week...</a></a>

<i>&gt; billionaire that could give us some money". I don't think that is a viable </i><br>
<i>&gt; strategy to develop any technology or good. The billionaire simply provides </i><br>
<i>&gt; to little money. What cryonics needs is to get commercialy viable, then it </i><br>
<i>&gt; can use the full advantage of a market economy. Unfortunately, cryonics </i><br>
<i>&gt; companies have to get a lot more professional in their marketing and </i><br>
<i>&gt; customer service, and they have to  show clearer product value (I think they </i><br>
<i>&gt; still are relying too much on "nanotech Santa Claus"). Then they will </i><br>
<i>&gt; receive the capital to expand. Depending on good hearted patrons is not a </i><br>
<i>&gt; good alternative.</i><br>
