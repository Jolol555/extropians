Obviously you know more about this subject than me.  I'm just using the word
'slave' because when I talk about this people tell me it's slavery.

<p>
<a href="3450.html#3463qlink2">&gt; In the issue of treating minor children as 'slaves' or 'property',</a><br>
<i>&gt; nothing could be further fromt he truth. Just because you are their</i><br>
<i>&gt; guardian and must make most of their decisions for them does not make</i><br>
<i>&gt; you their master or their owner. Its a false analogy, which is disproven</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you take the case of an adult who is judged incompetent, either due</i><br>
<i>&gt; to medical condition that leaves them physically or mentally unfit to</i><br>
<i>&gt; make their own decsions, like a coma, or schitzophrenia, etc. Just</i><br>
<i>&gt; because you are their guardian does not make you their owner. On the</i><br>
<i>&gt; contrary, for anyone who has been in such positions it feels more like</i><br>
<i>&gt; they own you. My family is going through this right now with my mother's</i><br>
<i>&gt; parents, one of which is quite senile, while the other is merely a</i><br>
<i>&gt; senior citizen version of a spoiled brat.</i><br>

<p>
Property, when not state enforced, is merely what you can hang on to.

<p>
<a href="3450.html#3463qlink3">&gt; Now given my earlier description of a slave market, where oh where is it</a><br>
<i>&gt; legal to sell your children or other legal dependents????? Case closed.</i><br>

<p>
I fail to see your point.

<p>
<a href="3450.html#3463qlink4">&gt; Oh shit. As much as I would have applauded this when I was a child, now</a><br>
<i>&gt; that I'm an adult I can clearly say that the kind of decisions I made as</i><br>
<i>&gt; a child clearly demonstrated my unfitness to be treated as an adult.</i><br>
<i>&gt; What children need is parents who ACT LIKE ADULTS, something which I see</i><br>
<i>&gt; as sorely lacking in the current baby boomer generation of parents.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Children don't need to be adults, their parents need to be adults.</i><br>

<p>
Please reread the paragraph; I have not suggested the child be responsible
for anything, quite the opposite in fact.

<p>
<a href="3450.html#3463qlink5">&gt; So now you guys are advocating not only an inbred fealty to the state</a><br>
<i>&gt; welfare apparatus, but teach them to not honor their contracts either. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; now know at least two people IMNSHO should NOT be parents.</i><br>

<p>
I don't recall advocating any of the above.
