<a href="2471.html#2476qlink1">&gt;1. A particle of normal matter is moving forwards through time, minding its </a><br>
<i>&gt;own business, when it's involved in a collision.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. That collision 'bounces' the particle back in time. It continues on, but </i><br>
<i>&gt;now it's moving backwards rather than forwards, so appears like antimatter </i><br>
<i>&gt;to us.</i><br>

<p>
I don't mean to be annoying but I still have a problem with this.

<p>
Apparently a ball rolling is traveling forward in time as well.
When the ball hits something it bounces backward but still travels forward 
in time.

<p>
Unless you are saying that the particle is stationary traveling only forward 
in time and is struck by another stationary particle traveling backward in 
time.  That would send both particles in reverse, because two stationary 
balls traveling forward in time could never touch because they are both 
traveling in the same direction (in time) and not in any other dimension, 
unless of course one ball was traveling faster in time than the other.  So 
do you suppose that particles travel at different speeds in time?
