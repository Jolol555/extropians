<a name="2753qlink1">Let's suppose, for just a moment, that the miser mixes his $100 bills
in a solution of water and dough and proceeds to "paste" them all about
himself, creating a sort of paper mache effect.  Then, let's also
suppose that when the men in the white coats come to take him away,
that he jumps into a pool of his own molten gold.

<p>
Just suppose....

<p>
Who would want gold polluted with dead miser body parts??

We ask not your counsel nor your arms.  Crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you.  May your chains rest lightly upon you and may posterity forget that you were our countrymen."   --Samuel Adams</a><br>
