This seems like a true stumper to me, because the US consititution (as are 
all legal structures) is premised on a fundamental notion of individual 
autonomy of the various actors.  I happen to be reading "Quarantine" right 
<a name="4494qlink1">now, so I've been thinking about this question as I read the book.  It seems 
like your scenario would result in a fairly speedy collapse of the political 
order into multiple declarations of emergency by the various branches and 
levels of government and other, non-political institutions.  Each would be 
claiming to uphold the "true" constitutional order.</a>  Pretty bad: I see a 
fairly complete breakdown of what Francis Fukuyama has correctly (IMO) 
identified as the REAL basis of a functional civil society; TRUST.  I suppose 
this is a technological problem that can really only yield toa technological 
solution: A quick and reliable test for the "loyalty mod".  This is a really 
good metaphor for the "Red Scare" of the 1950s in US civil society, BTW.
