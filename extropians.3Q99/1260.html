<a href="1230.html#1260qlink1">&gt; I was looking up cloning and found a web site that has a petition to sign</a><br>
<i>&gt; in</i><br>
<i>&gt; support of cloning Elvis.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Of course I'd sign if it were Richard Feynman, but .............</i><br>

Do you think there'd be more support for cloning if the experts promised a
clone of JFK Jr? Maybe you could compile a list of the dead, clonable, and
ultra-right, for cloning propaganda to sell to numbskulls.

<p>
How about cloned sets of (dead) hollywood stars? You could buy a Marilyn,
James Dean, and Elvis set, to put in cheap cafes, instead of those hideous
pictures people insist on hanging. In fact, I saw one of these pictures the
other day which has those three, as children (dressed in their signature
gear of course), looking out over a cliff into the sky, where images of
their adult faces looked down at them from the clouds. You could get real
kid versions! Like the baby muppets for the baby boomers!

<p>
Now that's how to sell cloning to the voting public!
