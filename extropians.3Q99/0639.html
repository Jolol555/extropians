(S&amp;M isn't just about pain, but that is a thread for another forum :-)

In a similar vein to the fear thread, I think we'd want control of how much 
pain-damping our systems did, anyway, for survival reasons. You'd usually 
want SOME kind of signal on an injury ("*beeeep* left hand destroyed! 
estimated regrowth time one minute seven seconds. Consider avoiding further 
injury during this time").

<p>
So, a nice custom mod would be dual controls (as in pilot/copilot) -- on both 
pleasure and pain circuits. What the heck, selected motor circuits, too, for 
the ultimate in "soft bondage." The old-fashioned top might just want control 
of the overall intensity, delivering the stimuli the quaint old way; but 
there's a whole new world possible, of playing the nervous system like a 
synthesizer.<a name="0673qlink1"> The whips and featherdusters would become nostalgic props, and 
the real action would happen on the keyboard, or whatever interface we end up 
using (most likely a virtual body with virtual tools).</a> Favorite "pieces" 
would of course be recorded, and one could "compose" for oneself as well. All 
of the above applies equally well to any sort of erotica.
