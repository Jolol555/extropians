What would an AI build on top of such technology be like? You ask it a question
and it simulates an eternal debate among all possible minds against all possible
philosophical systems considering all expressable evidence until the process
converges to consensus (Instantly, that is.).

Well - I did say that it was my plan, not my excuse for staying in bed all day.
I have a carefully cultivated sense of cheerful futility, which I find is a
tremendous source of comfort. That may sound like giving up, but it isn’t,
really – It’s a way of making peace with the endless impossibilities and
frustrations of being human then resolving to make a some vague approximation of
the best of it, rather than setting myself up for endless guilt and
disappointment. Maybe that sounds childish to you, but then I feel the same way
about your unshakeable optimism and sense of self-importance. Whatever gets you
through the day.

<p>
<a href="3668.html#3681qlink5">&gt;Besides which, I don't drink. I don't dare. My neurology is weird</a><br>
<i>&gt;enough already.</i><br>

<p>
Too bad. I’m a big believer in better living through chemistry.

<p>
<a href="3668.html#3681qlink6">&gt;Yes, that's a Banks reference.</a><br>

<p>
Cheers – Banks is great, though I’ve been disappointed by everything he’s
written since _Consider Phlebas_, which goes on my personal top ten list.
_Player of Games_ was pretty good though.
