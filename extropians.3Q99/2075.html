<p>
I'm suprised no one has mentioned Ken MacLeod's _The Cassini Division_
now out in hardback in the USA.  This is a remarkable novel.  It deals
with several issues of Extropian ethics with such familarity that I
would expect that Mr. MacLeod has been lurking on the Extropians
mailing list for years.

<p>
The novel has some plot/logic problems.  For example, the author never
bothers to explain how the economic system of his Solar-system-wide
anarchosocialist society actually *works*.  Gee, I wonder why?  But,
overall it's interesting and entertaining reading.  It touches on a
variety of Extropian and libertarian ideas, and even includes an
amusing spoof of L. Neil Smith's North American Confederacy.

<p>
The viewpoint character is vehemently anti-transhuman, so it's
interesting to see through her how and why opposition to the
transhuman attitude might express itself.  I suspect MacLeod shares
than a few of his character's attitudes, given the way in which he
writes them.

<p>
An excellent novel, strongly recommended for Extropian/transhuman
readers.
