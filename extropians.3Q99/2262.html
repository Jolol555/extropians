<p>
My reading of the literature, science magazines &amp; web information
agrees with this.

<p>
&gt; however there are so<br>
<a href="2259.html#2262qlink3">&gt; many neutrinos they could make up the bulk of the universe.</a><br>

<p>
This, I would question.  In my surveys of the dark matter
literature, I've read several discussions that indicate
that even with neutrinos with mass at the high end of the
proposed ranges, there would not be enough of them to
account for the dark matter (which according to some (most?)
arguments are 80-90% of the universe).

<p>
I would cite, that Alcock (the dean of Gravitational Microlensing
observations) attributes black holes as the possible source for
his observations &amp; missing mass.  In my discussions with other
astronomers, they cite interstellar/intergalactic hydrogen
as an explanation for the missing mass.  Some astronomers
argue brown dwarfs or combinations of brown dwarfs and
gas clouds.  Neutrinos are *very* far down on the list of
"the bulk of the universe" for everyone except perhaps those
scientists running the experiments looking for neutrino mass.
