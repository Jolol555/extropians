<p>
Brian, this is one case where even a legal contract may not be valid,
since
<br>
the resulting child did not sign it.  Years ago I was asked to be a
sperm donor by an associate.  I discussed it with a friend who had
been a sperm donor while a student at Harvard.  He informed me
that it takes *very careful* and costly legal work to insure no
liability on the part of a sperm donor, and *NO* doing it the old
fashioned way, if one is to have any hope of escaping liability down
the road a few years.

<p>
I did not donate.  spike
