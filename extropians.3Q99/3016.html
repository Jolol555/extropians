At Extro 4, it was evident that there is a great desire for us to work
together to carve the emerging culture.  I have great respect for Robert
Bradbury's contributions as well, Greg, and your mental power and ability
to collaborate.

Last night I had dinner with a very close friend who has made a name for
herself as an author and recording artist.<a name="3050qlink1">  Her encouragement of me to move
forward, don't look back, take it on, and ignore the small-minded folks who
feel envy or anger or combativeness who try to tear down the strengths of

creativity.<a name="3050qlink2">  It is hard sometimes because it impairs, but it is essential
in order to get work done when on presenting new  ideas that ruffle feathers.</a>

<p>
The greatest art form of this time is ourselves and our ideas!  I say stand
firm, be publically polite and learn how to express ideas objectively and
<a name="3050qlink3">with a calm but speak up when misinformation needs to be addressed.  The
skills that allow adversaries to *not* feel threatened and is our best tool.</a>
