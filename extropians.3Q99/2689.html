Given that the human brain is capable of such amazing things, I find it absurd

fully believe that despite the profound differences between us all, that the
reason for profound stupidity is the educational system.

<p>
In my opinion, the educational system is hell bent on stamping out individual
differences. But we are individuals, and the only way for people to make the most
of their brains, is by pursuing their own interests, and finding our own way of
learning.

<p>
The people on this list, probably do have better genes than most people.  But I
bet that most of us snuck out and read books, when we were suppose to be engaging
in structured activities.<a name="2695qlink4"> We left the herd and learned to think for ourselves.
