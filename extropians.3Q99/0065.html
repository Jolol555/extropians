I have never heard someone say queer is a state of nausea.  As I understand
it, the word meant weird or different.<a name="0192qlink1">  Being "weird" is not a bad thing, as

nobody wants to be boring or normal.  We all like to be strange or "special"
in some way.

<p>
The actual reason that the word "fag", short for "faggot" is derogatory, is
that it does indeed refer to the bundle of sticks gathered to be burned.
Cigarettes are also called fags in this sense, as well as fire-sticks, for
this reason.  Calling someone a "faggot" was originally done not primarily
toward gays, but to witches or heretics who were expected to eventually be
burned at the stake for their blasphemous crimes.  Anybody who was an evil
or immoral person who was expected to be eventually rounded up by the Church
and burned at the stake could be called a "faggot".  It basically meant the
person was a heretic/antichristian who hadn't been caught and executed by
the Church yet.
