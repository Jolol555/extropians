I know, aren't you sick of hearing naturist platitudes? No sh*t we need
fresh air and exercise. What most of us want to know is how to slow down
the aging process itself, not just how to end up the healthiest patient in
the nursing home! I'm glad you asked this.

<p>
<a href="0951.html#0977qlink2">&gt; information one way or another even regarding these. </a><br>

<p>
Good, good question. There are a lot of platitudes and a lot of smoke
surrounding the topic of longevity, and few simple answers. So far, we
know the following with a reasonable degree of certainty:


<OL>
  <li>  Rats and mice on a diet that has the same levels of vitamins, minerals,
and proteins but 40% fewer calories than what they would eat if given free
access to food, have lifespans that are almost double.

  <li>  Most biochemical and anatomical symptoms of aging are delayed in these
animals, so the low calorie diet isn't just preventing one particular
disease.

  <li>  We don't know if this will work on humans, but early data from monkey
experiments looks good. Do read Roy Walford's book, as someone suggested,
he's done some interesting stuff. Also, if you do decide to CR yourself,
start SLOW. I went into some serious depression when I attempted too
radical a CR regimen. Also, if Tyler Parr's theory is correct, it may be
possible to replicate the effects of caloric restriction without actually
having to undergo it. This is beyond the scope of this posting, but there
will be more info on this on the GerOL web page by Friday.

<a name="0980qlink1">  <li>  Sunlight *will* screw up your skin, and will increase the risk cancer
later in life, especially if you're pale. Wear the highest SPF-rating
sunscreen you can buy and take (moderate!) vitamin D supplements to
prevent rickets.</a>

  <li>  Data is accumulating on melatonin, but is still sketchy. DHEA data is
even sketchier. Remember, just because the levels of some substance
decline in your blood over your lifespan, that doesn't necesserily meen
that orally administering that substance will keep you young.
Notwithstanding the amount of press antioxidants have gotten, there is
very little clinical evidence that they actually extend the lifespans of
lab animals, let alone humans.

  <li>  Some people take growth hormone (GH). It does decline throughout the
lifetime, but high levels of GH might encourage cancer. The key is hormone
sensitivity, not just the crude levels of the hormone in your blood. Look
up Tyler Parr's excellent reviews.

  <li>  The real breakthroughs in longevity are still to be made. Governments
and corporations should be targetting aging research as a budget priority.
We, as consumers and tax-payers should urge them in this direction. These
are not just empty pronouncements; in my own small way I'm contributing to
the cause of life extension and so can you. I've started a site called
GerOL: Gerontology OnLine. <a href="http://gerol.us.itd.umich.edu/">http://gerol.us.itd.umich.edu/</a>
	It has summaries of current articles from research journals (with
most of the technical words linked to definitions), aging news,
information from readers about longevity links they've found, and many
other resources. It's updated almost daily, and each news item has a chat
forum feature where lay-persons and researchers alike can discuss the
implications of the news.


</OL>
<p>
			Cutting Through The Hype

<p>
A few personal rules of thumb:


<OL>
  <li>  I never trust a supplement company to give the whole story. They might
have correct and useful data, but they also have a vested interest. Read
what the actual researchers have to say for a second opinion.

  <li>  No reputable researcher or company will ever make claims of
'immortality', 'miracle drugs', or 'fountains of youth'. The popular press
is a different story, because...

  <li>  The popular media is always on the lookout for ways to spice up their
stories. Most TV, newspaper, and magazine treatments of technical subjects
are useful only for the names of the people and institutions involved, so
you can get on the web and search for what *they* have to say for
themselves.

  <li>  Modern medicine has its shortcomings, but it's delivered some
impressive life-expectancy results compared to shamanism, faith healing,
prayer, and other paranormal/nature-worshipping hooey. A favorite tactic
of charlatans is to take potshots at 'Western' medicine and the scientific
method.

  <li>  Cryonics and nanotech have intriguing implications for life extension,
but it's nice to hedge your bets. After all, you'll want to guarantee your
own survival at least long enough for nanorepair and true cryonic revival
to become available.

  <li>  Above all, there is the danger of wishful thinking; wanting to believe
that *this* supplement is the key, *this* research team has discovered the
mechanism of aging. The truth is usually more mundane, requires hard work,
and is sometimes unpleasant to hear.



</OL>
<p>
Anyway, I wish you luck on your quest. If you find any interesting
information, please post it to GerOL.
