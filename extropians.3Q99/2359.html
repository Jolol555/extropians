<a href="2300.html#2359qlink1">&gt;This depends on whether or not the entity is conscious, and has functioning </a><br>
<i>&gt;systems to provide pain to that consciousness. I personally doubt that </i><br>
<i>&gt;embryos are conscious, but this is merely a hunch, as the truth is we just </i><br>
<i>&gt;don't know yet.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2399qlink3">So are you saying that we should hold off experimenting with human embryos 
because we don't know if they're conscious or not?</a>  What about other animal 
embryos?  Is it ok to experiment on them<a name="2399qlink4"> because their not human? Why?</a>

<p>
<a href="2300.html#2359qlink2">&gt;The fear of death as a concept is a primal instinct - as with the vast </a><br>
<i>&gt;majority of concepts humans come into contact with, there is an associated </i><br>
<i>&gt;emotional response. This is not built on logical thought - and as such is </i><br>
<i>&gt;knowledge independent. Again, the question is does an embryo have the </i><br>
<i>&gt;necessary systems?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2419qlink1"><a name="2399qlink6">It has occurred to me that all emotions are varying degrees of fear, and 
</a></a>pleasure.<a name="2399qlink7">  I assume that hate must be developed after fear because you hate 
someone that can do you harm.</a>  To recognize that you must fear the thing you 
hate.<a name="2399qlink8">   A baby learns that it is happy when it feels</a> good and its parents 
reinforce that feeling.<a name="2399qlink9">  Later it learns the word for happy.  I'm not sure 
how it learns fear.</a> Why is a baby scared when no one is around?  Is it 
<a name="2399qlink10">because it is feeling uncomfortable, looks around for its parents that 
usually make it feel comfortable, can't find them and starts to fear</a> that it 
<a name="2399qlink11">will always be uncomfortable?</a>  It seems to me that this infant would 
<a name="2399qlink12">eventually associate situations with varying degrees of comfort.</a>  Sounds 
<a name="2399qlink13">pretty logical to me.  What do you think?</a>

<p>
<a href="2300.html#2359qlink3">&gt;Identity? What is it? Ny name? How is this relevant to the fear and pain of </a><br>
<i>&gt;death?</i><br>

<p>
This is a mistake on my part with wording.  I was trying to say that it 
doesn't have a personality.  I realize that it doesn't relate though so I 
take it back.

<p>
<a href="2300.html#2359qlink4">&gt;we're still animals after all. We don't use logic to create emotions</a><br>

<p>
<a name="2399qlink14">Above I think I showed how an animal (an infant anyways) creates emotions 
based on fear and comfort.</a>  I have taught myself to control my emotions by 
<a name="2399qlink15">picturing certain situations or changing my thoughts to create desired 
emotional responses.</a>  So you can use logic to create emotions.  Whether or 
not you'd want to do this is a different story.
