<p>
E-shaun begins by asking.......

<p>
<i> &gt;An even deeper question</i><br>
<a href="4787.html#4815qlink1"> &gt;(and one which I have never been able to answer for myself) is *why* an</a><br>
<i> &gt;artist creates in the first place.</i><br>

<p>
Natasha: 
<p>
        &gt;&gt;It is like this creative intelligence growing in the brain that 
sends
<p>
        signals through the capillaries to the intricate network of the body 
<pre>
--
        from the esophagus down through to the "gut" and causing a wonderful    
        ache,  a anxiously awaited joy to express!

Well put, indeed. And to me also almost an erotic satisfaction, a euphoria 
that occurs when I am in that state, sometimes to the point where I have to 
almost stop working out of overwhelm.
I believe other arts besides 'art' probably cause that kind of euphoria, i 
have heard it expressed by mathematicians and musicans as well.
 
<br>
<i> &gt; Is it to prove one's ability? </i><br>
     &gt;&gt; Natasha:
        
        &gt;&gt;If I produce a painting -- it is to not to establish to anyone else 
my own
        authenticity or validity.  My work speaks for itself and the emotion 
of
        expression has its own worth.  

<a name="4821qlink2">For this Muse,  it is different, I *definetely* paint and create to prove 
myself. Not that I need the approval of *all* people, but if everyone hated 
my work I would be very crushed. I consider myself a very good artist, but I 
like to be seen, heard and liked.</a> 
I need it to survive, almost as much as the money I make from it. It is a 
very important part of my art - validation. I have learned this about myself 
and I therefore put my work in front of the public as much as possible. Which 
is very hard to do for me. Since it matters so very much.... sigh....

<br>
<i> &gt; If so,</i><br>
<a href="4787.html#4815qlink2"> &gt;why is it necessary to attain popular approval for one's own creations?</a><br>
        Natasha:
<a name="4821qlink4">        &gt;&gt;It isn't necessary.  It is business.  I'm not interested in popular
        approval as much as I am interested in producing work that is 
valuable and
        having my business successful.  To questions the necessity of getting
        approval sure sounds like a very insecure person.  Not good for 
</a>creating or
        expression.

<a name="4821qlink5">Damn right, Natasha, and a lot of people think artists don't</a> really  "work".  
<a name="4821qlink6">I am always hearing "oh how fun that must be"  - fun... hah!!!</a>  Well, 
shee-it, it is none other than, bone-crushing, finger-numbing, back-breaking, 
muscle-building hard-ass physical labor. And if I don't recieve renumerative 
compensation of the highest order, I'd be nuts to do it for a living , given 
the kind of stigmas attached.
 
<br>
<i> &gt;Why does an artist feel the need to either</i><br>
<i> &gt;conform to or react against popular culture?  </i><br>
     Natasha:
<a name="4821qlink7">    &gt;&gt;I suppose the same reason anyone would</a> conforms or reacts?  It is not a
    prescribed character trait of us artists -:)

<a name="4821qlink8">Who are you to say what we feel a need to do? I paint pretty things, that 
have nothing to do with pop culture, then I blatantly offend stutus quo in 
the next breath.</a>
I would sugeest that you re-examine the above statement for bias. What I will 
say is that a lot of artists make their living by tuning in to what is known 
as the "Zeitgeist (SP?)" of a culture ( Pulp Fiction good example) and 
massaging it to make a statement. That 's what it takes to make a buck....

<br>
<i> &gt;And again, what *is* the</i><br>
<i> &gt;purpose of art?  </i><br>
    Natasha:
<a name="4821qlink9">        Imagine a world without it?  Can we get through a day without 
</a>interfacing
        with art?
 
<a name="4821qlink10">Yeah , you might as well ask, what is the purpose of creation, or what</a> is the 
purpose of expression? The purpose of art - of any discipline. What kind of 
art?  Of course I assume you mean visual art: if so are you talking about 
images? Sculpture? Graphic Art? Animation? Tattoos? How about Pageantry? 
Performance? Film? Net.art? Music?  Storytelling? Design? Decoration? 
Clowning? Choreography? Lighting? Theater? Healing? Journalism? ...ad 
infinitum. What a general question.. be more specific. Even popular art is so 
diverse!!!   
The purpose of "cloisonee ceramics" is very differnent than the purpose of 
"Body piercing". Both are art. ( or, arguably, neither)

<br>
<i> &gt;So when talking</i><br>
<a href="4787.html#4815qlink3"> &gt;about popular art, is there a lowest common denominator of sorts to</a><br>
<i> &gt;determine what people will like or want to see?</i><br>
 
        Natasha:
<a name="4821qlink12">        &gt;&gt; I'm not sure we can group civilization together so tightly by 
giving a
        one-liner sound bite to "art for civilization's sake."</a>  
 
<a name="4821qlink13">Enuff said. Except, I would add, where is this question coming from, and why 
do you ask it. And what -- to you -- is lowest denominator popular art? 
hmm.... for me I woudl say....   Beany Babies?</a>

<a name="4821qlink14">(snip -- Natasha's good  answer about storytelling)</a>
<br>
<i> &gt;Natasha:</i><br>
        &gt;Art and aesthetics and our senses  - seeing, hearing, tasting, 
touching
        smelling, loving are such a sensorial experience.   Let them speak to 
us
        and dance with us!  OH! Here comes a gllimmer of light across my 
studio
        wall.  Delightful play of elements.
 
   
And in well made and well recieved creative '"arts" - you may find that an 
outlet for finely tuned emotion is expressed.. and felt and heard and  played 
with such a love of life that it might even touch you somewher in your core 
essence awake with joy or tears.....
<a name="4821qlink15">       And again not to hammer in a point, it is a trained ear that hears the 
subtley of beats and the scientific instrument that measures</a> the harmonics... 
<a name="4821qlink16"> and both are important to understanding the beast...</a>

and maybe a glass of wine will help too... ; )
