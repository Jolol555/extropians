<a name="0479qlink2">It seems to me that you are suggesting that we implant such "Laws" into

<a name="0479qlink4">  <li>  It is immoral to try.</a>  What you are talking about is mind control, which
is a particularly pernicious form of slavery.  These are *people* we are

prevent them from evolving their own (superior) versions as they learn.</a>
