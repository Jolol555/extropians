How about microloaning to Americans in America? In Appalachia, or Watts,
or in hells kitchen? We do have our own micro cultures of third world
level development.

<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; Solar is good for this, as are various Cogeneration ideas.</i><br>

<p>
Solar is the most expensive source of generation available (20 to 75
cents per kwh). Micro-wind turbines on the other hand are quite cost
effective for small third world applications, even with nomadic peoples.
The hand cranked devices like radios, flashlights, and Apple's
forthcoming hand cranked laptop are also an excellent technology. One
technology I have not seen however, that I think is being ignored,
possibly because of vegan agendas of many aid workers against domestic
animals, is the use of an electric generator powered by domestic animals
like donkeys, cows, horses, etc. These animals are generation plants
that most third world people already own (where do you think the phrase
'horsepower' came from anyways?), so this greatly decreases the
investment requirements both by the third world populations as well as
by aid organizations or governments. Encouraging third world communities
to build cogeneration systems based on the common fuels they are used to
leads both to deforestation and additional CO2/CO contribution to the
levels of human pollution, as third world populations use the lowest
grade fuels available: wood, coal, dung, and raw oil.

<p>
However, keep in mind that the only benefits that internet connectivity
can offer to third world populations in remote areas is to lower costs
of education, and lower costs to market unique cultural crafts to the
world market, that are, while beneficial, secondary to the primary needs
of most of these people to feed themselves, obtain health care, and
survive often turbulent weather and political climates.
