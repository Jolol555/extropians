<a name="3525qlink2">Logically, existence cannot have a purpose, because teleology assumes an
entity external to the goal meta-system under consideration.</a> IOW, all of
existence must define for itself the categories of its own teleology, since
existence includes all that exists. The concept of "meaning" makes sense
only to the separate agents who define it (for themselves or others). People
who object to circular definitions in cosmology fail to appreciate that all
language systems define thier semiotic terms with other terms.

<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; violate the laws of entropy I would have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; disagree.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Why?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The simplest answer is that if I disavow some basic laws of physics</i><br>
<i>&gt;John Clark will have my head on a silver platter.  A more complex</i><br>
<i>&gt;answer is because a big chunk of what I've been researching the</i><br>
<i>&gt;last two years (what are the limits to computing [intelligence])</i><br>
<i>&gt;rests on the idea that you can't violate entropy.  So I've got</i><br>
<i>&gt;a vested interest in SIs having limits.  I would probably believe</i><br>
<i>&gt;that SIs have a better chance of tunneling out of this universe than</i><br>
<i>&gt;violating the laws of entropy.  Finally, on the slippery slope</i><br>
<i>&gt;from classical physics to magical physics, I find it satisfying</i><br>
<i>&gt;to draw a line that says -- "This is as far as I go buddy"</i><br>
<i>&gt;(said with a John Wayne accent).</i><br>

<p>
Complex adaptive (extropic) systems don't necessarily need to violate
entropy. Rather, they feed off it. The process of entropy can eventuate in
the complexity of chaos, which provides intelligence with more intricate
patterns in which to organize itself and so to manipulate the environment
more powerfully. Without entropy, the multiverse becomes static, dead,
changeless. Entropy supplies the raw material, so to speak, for life to ride
to higher levels of complexity.

fail to transcend philosophy to embrace science, especially the science</a> of
subjectivity.
