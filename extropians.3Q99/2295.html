	&gt;Those SI's which have motivation to control the substrates on
<br>
<a href="2214.html#2295qlink1">&gt;which SI's are built shall proliferate and others will become food.</a><br>
<p>
	&gt;The idea that SI's will do anything else with humanity but grind it
<br>
<a href="2214.html#2295qlink2">&gt;up for spare atoms and is nothing short of religious faith.</a><br>

<p>
I don't think that we can be sure about the nature of secondary motivations.
Remember - the enhanced humans will of course have to choose their
motivation set before implementing it. The choices will therefore be made
from a human standpoint. I can't imagine many humans that would choose the
ideas that you describe. 
<br>
Of course, with each new iteration of the motivation choosing process, the
influence of the original human motivation will diminish, but probably never
totally disappear, just as some (very few - microscopic) of the original
dirt particles will always remain in a shirt that you wash many times. By
this time, there are unlikely to be any humans left in their original form -
unless of course we're talking very short times between each iteration - but
I can't imagine why the decision makers would want to accelerate this
process as this would be an identical situation to the one you describe -
one in that the original human decision makers decide to flush humanity down
the toilet.
