I suspect that uploading"consciousness" probably is equivalent to copying the
picture on your TV. You might be able to copy the hardware/software that
produces the image, not the actual image.
What about a VCR doesn't that copy the picture?  No it just makes an image of
that picture. How about DVD ? Isn't every DVD disk like every other one with
the same title ? Yes, but they are still just an image of the original event
series.
<br>
Rather than trying to copy "consciousness" into some other medium maybe the
<a name="1502qlink1">way to true longevity of " consciousness"  is to increase the amount of  an
individual's information processing that resides out of body until it reaches
a point at which the death of the biologic component is of no significant
importance to that individual.<a name="1476qlink1"> What is the significance of the loss of
1/1000000 of an individual's " consciousness"?</a>
