<p>
Enjoying, feeling, and loving is comparatively trivial compared to the
problem of cognition.  Not absolutely trivial, not easy, but not
anywhere near as hard, either.

<p>
And it takes a *lot* of brute force to overcome the distinction between
recognizing a good idea and originating one - and even then you still
have to code the recognition ability.

Logic says there's, oh, at least a 50% chance of this being essentially
<a name="3602qlink2"><a name="3601qlink2">a 100% probability.  My intuitions, though, tell me that this Universe
is real down to the quark level, which I don't think would be necessary
if this were a simulation.  Then again, in this sort of situation it's
kind of hard to trust one's intuitions - but I still do.</a></a>
