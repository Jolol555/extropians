<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt; For the record, I came us with "ultrahuman" several months ago,</i><br>
<i>&gt; while thinking about my book and my talk for the conference. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; was surprised and amused to see your use of the term immediately</i><br>
<i>&gt; before I first used the term publically at the conference (though</i><br>
<i>&gt; it had been on the conference program for a while before that).</i><br>
<i>&gt; This isn't really surprising though. Several people have</i><br>
<i>&gt; independently come up with "extropy" and "transhuman" (or</i><br>
<i>&gt; "trans-human").</i><br>

<p>
	I, of course, was not suggesting that anyone isn't capable of
independent thought!  I may have been confused about which email Brian
meant earlier.  About a year ago, a group of us *humanists* :-) who had
been discussing the issue of the human and the "post-" or "non-" or
"ultra-" or "mega-" or "neo-human" were wondering what more heavily
techno types would think about these thoughts, and so Brain, the only
one of us who would happily transfer himself into a quantum computing
device, discussed the question with a few people from this list.  I had
the impression you were one of them but I guess not.  No matter. 
Sometimes the zeitgeist rotates a notch and suddenly ideas are just "in
the air".  (Actually, I'm curious who used the term previously.  Since
it's in the OED, a full entry would show this. I'll see if I can dig it
up.)

<p>
	Anyway, for us, the question of the merits of a new term had to do with
changing historical circumstances.  Something is different now in a
*radical* way.  Might it be that the essence of humanism is no longer
appropriate for the changing historical circumstances?  It's a rather
difficult question, but my answer would be that yes, it is.  But perhaps
times call for a zeroing in on this essence of humanism, since the term
and even the notion itself is becoming clouded by "flesh fetishists". 
If so, then either a reappropriation of the term, or a new term like
"ultrahumanism" or "neohumanism" or "Urhumanism"(?) would be good. 
"Posthumanism" and even "transhumanism" don't make a lot of sense,
*unless* the point is specifically that flesh is bad, because limited
and so on.  Of course, haven't we been through that issue a few times in
the last two thousand years (The Reformation, for ex.)? :-)
