<p>
No argument from me in the slightest on that one.

<p>
Yes. I meant the question "What's ethical?" as a general
question, and thus not one simply about which action is ethical
from within a particular theory. (Your proof doesn't apply to
all theories.)

<p>
Again, my experience with philosophers from within the
pragmatist or utilitarian traditions is that their answers to
the question -- which answers would require justifying a
"system," not answering the question from within a system -- end
up being circular.

<p>
Not that philosophers from other traditions have clearly solved
the problem either, of course....

<p>
(ergo: let's keep thinking; NOT [simply]: party on, dude.)
