<p>
Is there a near-term role for manned space stations?  I've just finished T.A. 
Heppenheimer's "Countdown: A History of Spaceflight."  One of the theses of 
this book is that the original vision of the first and second generation of 
space pioneers has been made irrelevant by the advance of electronics and 
computers.  He describes the story familiar to space enthusiasts of the 
original conception of a gradual "conquest of space" through the building of 
reusable spaceplanes, manned orbital space stations and eventual 
interplanetary exploration and development.  This vision, so compellingly 
portrayed by Willy Ley and Chesley Bonestell in the 1952 Colliers Magazine 
series, was adopted as essentially an article of faith by the second 
generation of rocket and space pioneers, among them Arthur Clarke and Werner 
von Braun.  Heppenheimer makes the case that this vision has been handed down 
to subsequent generations of space technologists and policy makers as a plan 
of action that has been made at least partially irrelevant by the advance of 
electronics and automation.  For instance, he discusses how in the 1930s, 40s 
and 50s Clarke and others envisioned geosynchronous communication "stations" 
as being manned by astronautical switchboard operators, something that's 
obviously not necessary now.

<p>
I grew up with this same vision and recall the Bonestell paintings 
illustrating the Colliers articles as some of the most formative images of my 
youth.  The goal of building a permanently manned orbital platform as an 
important foundation of a program of space exploration and development is 
very deeply ingrained in my psyche.  The idea that there will soon be humans 
living off Earth all the time (if not yet "permanently") is one of the 
exciting prospects raised for me by the first few ISS missions.

<p>
Now, it seems true to me that having a constant human presence off Earth (if 
only barely so) has important positive social and cultural impacts.  But is 
there any economic rationale for it?  I find NASA's relatively vague 
pronouncements about microgravity research unconvincing.  For the near term, 
I can see ISS serving as a "construction shack" and repair base (the latter 
requiring a -- probably automated -- "tug" for retrieving satellites to be 
repaired) (such a tug could well be developed as a second-generation 
derivative of ESA's ATV vehicle being created as part of the ISS program; 
see:

<a name="0805qlink1"><a name="0783qlink1">Is this latter mission for ISS really viable in the time before, say, 2025 or 
so?  I know there's been quite a bit of talk lately about "space tourism", 
but I'm skeptical of this as a viable economic development within the next 25 
years (after a fairly advanced nanotechnology is developed, yes).  I'd be 
<a name="0779qlink1">especially curious to hear the thoughts of younger folks who may well not be 
infected so strongly with the "space station meme".</a></a></a>
