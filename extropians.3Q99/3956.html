  IAN: Thanks Spike! Last night watching a 
  Dateline segment on Waco I made what may 
  be an important observation. Regular nonFLIR
   video taken above the Mt Carmel Center 
  showed reflections of sunlight off the large 
  pool in the back, as one might expect. So I
<a name="3969qlink1">  watched the FLIR, which rotates around the 
  Center dozens of times, and there are *never*
  any sunlight reflections in the water from 
  any angle. This is an ideal reflection-test
  that basically proves that the FLIR did not 
  pick up sunlight reflections that a regular 
  camera did. This makes sense if you think
  about it. The beam of sunlight coming off a
  body sitting in the sun is not itself going
  to be a lot (or any) hotter than the body
  itself, and the FLIR only sees hot/cool.

<p>
  I believe that that observation does fatal
  damage to the sunlight-reflection theory
  regarding the obvious gun-muzzle flashes.</a>

<p>
  Another breakthrough for independent 
<br>
  researchers that's been eclipsed by the 
  latest on Waco is that recently acquired 
<a name="3960qlink1">  radar data from the NTSB shows that there
  were 30 ships (!) below Flight 800, most
  of them are in or are heading toward the 
  active naval-warning zone.</a> The official 
  story is that the only Navy ship in the 
  area was 180 miles away, but these Navylike
   ships are within 30 miles. Details:
