For travellers, writers, and omnivorous readers, I recommend:

_Kiss, Bow, or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries_
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558504443">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1558504443</a>

<p>
It includes cultural overviews, behavior styles, negotiating techniques, 
protocol, and business practices.  (Indonesians often consult astrologers,
and delay signing papers until a "lucky" day arrives. Romanians shake
hands constantly.)  The amazon link has pointers to several other books 
on similar subjects.

<p>
On a related topic, there are several equivalent books for religions practiced 
in the US. The one I've seen is --

_How to Be a Perfect Stranger: A Guide to Etiquette in Other People's Religious Ceremonies_
