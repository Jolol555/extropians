I believe Spike was responding to my request for help in transcribing *our*
tapes of the event. Taping of the conference for other than private use
requires permission. We will be making available as much of the proceedings
as possible, plus extra links, and additiona resources. I would be very
unhappy to see unauthorized transcripts or audio or video recordings made
publically available. For example, one of the research scientists who
presented has asked that we not publish her talk yet, since she is
submitted it to a journal, and our public publication would ruin her chance
to be published in the journal.

<p>
If you mean the Breakthroughs shows (rather than the other TV shows we've
appeared on), you need to direct that request solely to Natasha since that
was her show -- she produced it, and it had nothing to do with Extropy
Institute (although several ExI people have appeared on it).

<p>
I had a fantastic time at Extro 4. Despite the post-conference fatigue, I
find myself eager to think about Extro 5 for 2000 and have some ideas
brewing. For those of you who didn't make it (big mistake!), we will be
incrementally adding conference materials to the web site starting later
this month.
