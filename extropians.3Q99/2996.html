For the most part I did too until I realized that nanotech (really
biotech) could assemble food.  I didn't realize that taxes could go
away until I actually wrote the piece and realized that people don't
have to work.

It really comes down to programmable self-replicating machines and
much more efficient power conversion that plants currently do.  If you
have those two things (and we do already), you get most of the benefits
I described without a requirement for hard nanotechnology.  [You can
"grow" your house out of bacteria that produce bone, shell, tooth enamal
etc.]

<p>
I'm not sure anyone understands all of the implications of exponential
technology growth.  Eric and some of the Foresight Senior Associates seem
to understand many of them because they have been thinking about them
for a long time.

<p>
I'm not so sure "keeping up with the Jones" will operate as much.
How many people do it now because it is the only thing they can do?
When you can design and build just about anything you can imagine
I think it will be much more interesting to see how different I can
be in comparison to my neighbors.

<p>
I will put money on on aging being *well* understood before we get 
hard nanotechnology.  I think it is well understood now, people just
don't have the scientific "proof" yet.  I don't think entertainment
services will be that expensive.  There will be many more people
with much more time on their hands and fewer barriers to their expressing
their creativity.  There will be many more entertainment sources
competing for people attention.  The 100+ channels on my satellite
dish don't cost me any more probably (allowing for inflation) than
the 20 or so one used to get when cable was first developed, they
may even be cheaper.  How can amusement parks be expensive when
anyone can build one? etc.

<p>
Yep, the move by the RedHat (Linux) folks to grant people who had
contributed to the open source movement "rights" to get their
stock during the IPO, clearly showed there is a new paradigm
in the world -- "give it back to the people who gave".

They do and there are many of them inside of you... :-)

<p>
Governments can't exert too much control if you are free to remove
yourself from that control.

Some thoughts about this are in Hal Plotkin's S.F. Gate article:
