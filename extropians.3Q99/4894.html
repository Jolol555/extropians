<i>&gt; his art is in a color scheme that implies rot, death and decay. It's horroe </i><br>
<i>&gt; genre. It impies pain. And metal. And low temperatures. Of course, he mixes </i><br>
<i>&gt; bio with machine which is a theme I adore, and he's a friggin' genius. But i </i><br>
<i>&gt; want lively, yummie, soft, inviting futurecities. </i><br>
<i>&gt;  That AIN"T giger.</i><br>

<p>
Of course, all the future teenagers with angst (it is a social custom, almost
everybody buys themselves a teenage angst personality mod sometime
during their adolescence :-) will use nan to redecorate their rooms or
houses a la Giger. 

<p>
My problem with Giger nano is that most of his organic shapes are
based on organs and stuff we find in current biology, and they might
not be optimal for "nanorgans" which would look quite different. So a
<a name="4936qlink1">nanotech Giger might look quite different in some respects. As I
imagine advanced nanotech stuff it would look like iridiscent
fractals, with the geometric style of plankton, coral or seashells,
possibly with perfectly smooth and rounded surfaces protecting
delicate laceworks of fractal activity inside.</a>
