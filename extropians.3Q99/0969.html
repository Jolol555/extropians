<a href="0934.html#0969qlink1">&gt;Scientists should be trained in how to</a><br>
<i>&gt;spot fakery, and we as futurists and speculators need to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;better trained to avoid being sidetracked by nonsense.  That's</i><br>
<i>&gt;what I'm trying to point out here--nothing personal--you're</i><br>
<i>&gt;just a convenient target that popped up into the sights.</i><br>

<p>
_Please_.  Obviously we're not reaching each other at all, so can the 
smugness.  I'm a "convenient target."  Yes, I certainly seem to be--but 
because I've posted something pseudoscientific and irrational or because I'm 
not a "member of the club"?

<p>
You may not be calling me names anymore, but you just as well might be.  
"Sidetracked by nonsense."  I suppose you're doing this for my own good?  
You're quite the altruist, but I've had more than I can stand.

<p>
I think I have amply shown that there is a case to be made for possible 
artificiality of certain formations on Mars--however small a case this may be 
from a given viewpoint.  _Any_ reasonable person, faced with an issue of such 
explosive potential, would give the go-ahead.  But to dismiss it 
outright--along with a chance to get new images, virtually 
effortlessly--smacks of a certain unbecoming arrogance.

<p>
I'm not going to bother psychoanalyzing you, other than to say I think you're 
a pompous know-it-all, and a particularly mean one at that.
