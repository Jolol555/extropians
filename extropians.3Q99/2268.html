it should remain undetected.  The only downside I can see is that we'd need
a server to collect results and some people, if they found out, might
object.  But I would estimate that the amount of people who trade and run
these novelty attachments is far in excess of the number of GIMPS members,
and that the total CPU power would be much higher (you'd have virtually the
whole of AOL for instance).  Also, people who do trade these files aren't
likely to use a lot of CPU cycles (except for games, maybe) but (ironically)
are likely to have fast CPUs.  The same software could also be spread by
other means (using loopholes in Outlook, IE, Windows, AOL, et cetera),
although having them inside an executable might make for a better legal case
(if you had the user sign a disclaimer to install the software 99.99% would
say "yes" without reading</a> it).
