<p>
I don't want to defend Rand as a person -- I've heard enough horror stories
about her atrocious behavior -- but one should be aware when reading Branden
that he does have an axe to grind AND he also seems to have a tendency to
white wash his own actions.  At least, this is my impression.  (I wasn't
there, so maybe he's 100% correct, but I doubt it.)

<p>
As for Objectivism and Extropianism, well, my goals is more to know what is
true, though looking for relationships between things -- including belief
systems -- is one way of getting closer to that.  And I'm definitely
influence by both Objectivism and Extropianism.

Cheers!
