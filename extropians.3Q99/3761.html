<pre>
&gt;&gt; Thanks for your comments (below). A few quick
&gt;&gt; replies (though I think this is not a topic that
&gt;&gt; interests most Extropians, so letting it die is
&gt;&gt; fine by me).

<p>
That's what I thought too.

<p>
Didn't I say I'll "sign off on this topic?" You've been too civil and
interesting for me to ignore. But this WILL be brief.... (I've got a lot of
impending [and missed...] deadlines.)

<pre>
&gt;&gt; There are thus several assumptions/notions, etc.
&gt;&gt; whose truth obviously cannot be verified by
&gt;&gt; science itself (like empiricism).

</pre>
<p>
&gt; See below.<br>

<pre>
&gt;&gt; How does one translate into empirical terms the
&gt;&gt; question of the validity of empiricism? (Important:
&gt;&gt; "validity" is not the same as "utility," or so I
&gt;&gt; would [separately] argue.)

</pre>
<p>
<a href="3740.html#3761qlink2">&gt; Well, utility did come to mind.  Perhaps it is</a><br>
<i>&gt; only your parenthetical note which is</i><br>
<i>&gt; contentious at this point?</i><br>

<p>
<a name="3767qlink1">I think this is the main open question, yes. I have not seen an argument that
validity (or truth) should be understood as utility that isn't circular. This is
the problem with pragmatism (especially the American variety). --&gt;


<hr>
<br>
-How do you know utility is what should count as validity (or truth)?
"It works."

<p>
-How do you know "It works" is a valid criterion?
</a>"It works."
<hr>

<p>
Something like that.

<p>
(An example of things getting off track here would be someone responding: "Yeah,
but science DOES work!!" This isn't in question.)


<p>
Thanks again for your thoughts.
