Anders, are you sure that you aren't embelishing this?  I probably
read Aristoi more recently than you (check my ReadingList page),
and I don't remember this.  However, I did consider this an
impossible layout (Escheresque) as a desirable motif for a club
when the question came up (so perhaps I've internalized the
book scene in some way) but then I've got several Escher prints
so its a natural leap for my mind.

<p>
Now of course crossing my two favorite artists, Escher &amp; Erte
and you get some really far out images.

<p>
An alternate possible extropian motif -- SurvivalScene, where the
environment (physical, sensoral, etc.) keeps changing and you have
to rapidly adapt in various ways (position, shape, intellectually,
etc.) in order to stay in the Club.

<p>
<a name="5233qlink1">This is kind of a derivative of a Restaurant/club that was (and perhaps
still is in Seattle) called Entros.  They had half a dozen or more
"stations" where you and your other dining guests could solve puzzles,
make dolls, experience wierd physical stuff</a> (strange mazes?), etc.
while you were waiting for your table to come up.

<p>
Now of course this raises the question -- if Extro 5 is going to be
in Houston, who is going to investigate the Houston club scene for
us and make recomendations.  I think a great evening plan should
be to descend on one or more of the radical clubs available.  Its
going to have to be fairly big to hold a couple of hundred extropians
though...
