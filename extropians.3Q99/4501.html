<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; We should be in the mainstream *while* maintaining our daring</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; &gt; and original character.</i><br>

<a name="4546qlink4">Hm. I seem to have asked an unanswerable question.....</a>

<p>
<i>&gt;...or why would you</i><br>
<a href="4482.html#4501qlink2">&gt; have come...feeling the way you do?</a><br>

<p>
How is it that I feel, other than curious?

<p>
How would my curiosity mean there's something daring?

<p>
<i>&gt; Perhaps it is in</i><br>
<i>&gt; knowing that not *every* pc (that your words have been</i><br>
<a href="4482.html#4501qlink3">&gt; routed to) lies in front of just one more black hole.</a><br>

<p>
No pc is connected to a black hole, if you ask me.....

<p>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="4482.html#4501qlink4">&gt; And how is all this "inevitable?" The diemaker dies</a><br>
<i>&gt; and no one has bothered to learn hir art because of the</i><br>
<i>&gt; inevitableness of it all.</i><br>

<p>
Durkheim and Weber explain this best. Worth reading. And some would say
Nietzsche has the deepest explanation.

<p>
Nothing's *literally* inevitable of course. I just meant that history
took a turn a few centuries ago, and nothing we do is going to change it
much. There are too many diemakers now for the loss of a few to make a
difference. An asteroid can always strike the earth. But baring that,
technology progresses, and that's that.

<p>
<i>&gt; Dontcha ever wonder if you're</i><br>
<a href="4482.html#4501qlink5">&gt; just another one of those black holes?</a><br>

<p>
Always.

<p>
Again, sorry for any illegal questions.

<p>
Cheers,
