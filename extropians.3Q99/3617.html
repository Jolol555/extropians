I think the problem may be that I consider "mouse intelligence" to
be much more of an oxymoron than you do.  I can go to the hardware
store up the street and get a wrench that dynamically adapts itself
to fit the heads of bolts of different sizes.  So the wrench does the
job that it is designed to do.  Do I now have an "intelligent wrench"?

<p>
I agree completely that Doogie is "smarter" than WT mice.

<p>
No problem, all I've said is said is that *in my opinion*, improving
memory (which is a primary hippocampus function) is a substantially
lesser thing than improving what I call "intelligence".

<p>
The dictionary says:
<br>
  Intelligence:
<br>
    the ability to perceive logical relationships and use one's
    knowledge to solve problems and respond appropriately to
    *novel* situations ||
<br>
    capability of performing some functions usually associated with
    *human* reasoning

<p>
I just don't happen to think that the case is strong that improving
mouse *memory* will be a panacea for improving the "intelligence"
of higher mammals.
