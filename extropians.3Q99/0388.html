<i>&gt;From Dave Farber</i><br>

<i>&gt;FYI</i><br>
<i>&gt;The American Institute of Physics Bulletin of Science Policy News</i><br>
<i>&gt;Number 106: July 7, 1999</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;White House and Congress Show Support for Nanotechnology</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"It's amazing what one can do just by putting atoms where you</i><br>
<i>&gt;want them."  - Richard Smalley, Winner of 1996 Nobel Prize in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Chemistry</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;One area of research that is beginning to come in for special</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest from the White House and Congress is nanotechnology  </i><br>
<i>&gt;the study and application of materials, devices, and systems on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;scale of nanometers (10 ^-9, or 10 to the negative ninth power, meters).  </i><br>
<i>&gt;At this scale researchers are learning to manipulate individual atoms, </i><br>
<i>&gt;an ability that experts testified could lead to revolutions in </i><br>
<i>&gt;materials design, manufacturing, medicine, electronics, energy, </i><br>
<i>&gt;and numerous other fields of human endeavor.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The President's science advisor, Neal Lane, has rated</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology one of the government's 11 inter-agency R&amp;D</i><br>
<i>&gt;priorities for the purpose of planning the FY 2001 budget.  On</i><br>
<i>&gt;June 22, four witnesses extolled the promise of R&amp;D in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanometer range before a supportive House Science Subcommittee on</i><br>
<i>&gt;Basic Research.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Basic Research Subcommittee Chairman Nick Smith (R-MI) and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Ranking Minority Member Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-TX) both</i><br>
<i>&gt;commented on the enormous potential of nanoscale research.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;federal government is currently spending about $230 million per</i><br>
<i>&gt;year in this area, with NSF, DOD and DOE as the key players,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Smith reported.  Noting that "a significant amount of research is</i><br>
<i>&gt;currently underway in Europe and Japan," Smith questioned whether</i><br>
<i>&gt;the U.S. effort was sufficient, and what the federal and private</i><br>
<i>&gt;sector roles should be.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;A nanometer is "truly a magical unit of length," said Eugene</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wong, NSF's Assistant Director for Engineering.  "It is the point</i><br>
<i>&gt;where the smallest man-made things meet nature."  He discussed</i><br>
<i>&gt;the benefits of being able to change the properties of a material</i><br>
<i>&gt;without changing its chemical composition, by manipulating</i><br>
<i>&gt;materials atom-by-atom.  Instead of discovering new phenomena by</i><br>
<i>&gt;accident, he said,<a name="1720qlink1"> scientists can now</a> look for them</i><br>
<i>&gt;systematically or design them to order.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Paul McWhorter of Sandia National Laboratories compared the</i><br>
<i>&gt;promise of nanotechnology to the first silicon revolution in</i><br>
<i>&gt;microelectronics, saying this "second silicon revolution" had the</i><br>
<i>&gt;potential to surpass the impact of the first.  "Twentieth century</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies...pale in comparison  with what will be possible"</i><br>
<i>&gt;when scientists can build things one atom at a time, said Rice</i><br>
<i>&gt;University's Richard Smalley, winner of the 1996 Nobel Prize in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Chemistry.  He gave a personal example, citing the chemotherapy</i><br>
<i>&gt;he is undergoing as a "blunt tool" that kills other cells in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;body beside cancer cells; nanotechnology, he said, would allow</i><br>
<i>&gt;specially engineered drugs to target just cancer cells.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The witnesses agreed the federal government has to play a</i><br>
<i>&gt;fundamental role in funding nanotechnology R&amp;D.  They noted that,</i><br>
<i>&gt;although many future applications were apparent, much basic</i><br>
<i>&gt;research was needed before companies could be assured of</i><br>
<i>&gt;returning a profit from investment in the field.  Estimating that</i><br>
<i>&gt;the time horizon to develop a product could be 10 or 20 years,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Smalley said a private investor would be "a fool" to start up a</i><br>
<i>&gt;company at this stage.  Ralph Merkle of the XEROX Palto Alto</i><br>
<i>&gt;Research Center added that developing the potential of</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology would be a major project, like developing nuclear</i><br>
<i>&gt;weapons or lunar rockets.  He pointed out that cooperative</i><br>
<i>&gt;research is needed across many disciplines, including scanning</i><br>
<i>&gt;probe microscopy, supramolecular chemistry, protein engineering,</i><br>
<i>&gt;self assembly, robotics, materials science, computational</i><br>
<i>&gt;chemistry, self replicating systems, physics, and computer</i><br>
<i>&gt;science.  Government funding, he said, is both "essential and</i><br>
<i>&gt;appropriate:" while benefits of nanoscience will flow across many</i><br>
<i>&gt;companies and the entire economy, few companies can afford the</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources and time - years to decades - needed.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;McWhorter agreed that "the nation must maintain a leadership role."  </i><br>
<i>&gt;Private companies would invest substantially when government funding </i><br>
<i>&gt;has mitigated the risk, he said; federal investment will act as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;catalyst for private investment.  NSF is taking the lead on</i><br>
<i>&gt;funding the basic research and infrastructure, Wong said, as well</i><br>
<i>&gt;as coordinating the research effort across departments and</i><br>
<i>&gt;agencies.  He felt the NSF budget of approximately $9 million per</i><br>
<i>&gt;year was not enough, and said he was "eagerly advocating" for</i><br>
<i>&gt;more support in the FY 2001 budget.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The witnesses also concurred on the usefulness of international</i><br>
<i>&gt;cooperation, agreeing that if the U.S. tried to isolate its</i><br>
<i>&gt;research, it would lose intellectual vigor.  Wong praised the</i><br>
<i>&gt;current system of international competition and cooperation at</i><br>
<i>&gt;the same time, saying it was "a boon to the whole field."  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Those of us who heard this testimony," Smith concluded, "will be</i><br>
<i>&gt;flag bearers" for nanotechnology.  "It seems obvious," he added,</i><br>
<i>&gt;that there is enough information on the benefits "to aggressively</i><br>
<i>&gt;pursue research in this area" in the FY 2001 budget process.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Just a month before Smith's hearing, on May 20, the White House</i><br>
<i>&gt;Office of Science and Technology Policy issued a press release on</i><br>
<i>&gt;guidance given to heads of federal departments and agencies for</i><br>
<i>&gt;the FY 2001 budget planning process.  The guidance identifies</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotechnology as one of 11 "R&amp;D areas that are important</i><br>
<i>&gt;national efforts requiring coordinated investments across several</i><br>
<i>&gt;agencies."  These R&amp;D priorities are to be "incorporated in</i><br>
<i>&gt;department and agency budget submissions to OMB in early</i><br>
<i>&gt;September."  The President's National Science and Technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;Council (NSTC) will meet later in September "to review the S&amp;T</i><br>
<i>&gt;investment portfolio and help ensure the strongest possible R&amp;D</i><br>
<i>&gt;budget proposal for FY 2001."</i><br>
