&gt;&gt; Individuals can always rise above the predispositions
&gt;&gt; of their genetic heritage,

<a href="3454.html#3461qlink1">&gt; ...in *most* situations, there exist individuals who would</a><br>

OK, delete the "always".  I was in that comment referring more
to the intellectual/emotional aspects than the physcial ones,
which I imagine are easier to overcome (but even that can be
debated).  I, too, knew early in life that I would never be a
basketball player, despite being 6'3", because I had a vertical
leap of about an inch and a half, and the speed and agility of
a hippo.  But I did overcome the handicap of Southern Baptist
family and bleeding-heart democratic mom.  Indeed, I have since
enlightened her.

Even in email, anyone who has been around for a while can usually
tell the difference between male and female writers about 80% of
the time (I remember the last one I got wrong--I assumed Robin
Hanson was female until I discovered otherwise).
