I can't think of any good reason to continue extorting money for
science regardless of how "good" it is.  Certainly good has come out of
NASA, but at what cost to freedom?  The best thing the government could
do for science would be to discontinue all funding and offer complete
tax exemption for organizations doing research.  If we can get
government out of the picture, private industry will be able to
accomplish things never dreamed of by the extortionists at NASA. 

<p>
BTW, I know that NASA's budget is tiny compared to other programs, but
for the record I advocate the end of their funding as well!
