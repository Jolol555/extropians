Exactly, which is why I call it slavery.  Kids as property.</a>

<a name="3662qlink2"><a name="3445qlink1">Parents are the weak link in our chain; we need to remove them as early as
possible and replace them with someone who has a genuine (economic) interest
in the child.  To begin with the best we can do is offer good money for
children, soon after we might contract women to give birth to wholely</a> owned
children, and eventually we would grow them in labs (or farm them if you're
looking for an appropriate visual image).  I want child welfare to be an
systematic process of our economy without interference by parents who expect
more than dividends.</a>

<a name="3662qlink3"><a name="3450qlink3"><a href="3420.html#3443qlink3">&gt; The local data and expertise is fairly crucial, as the micro-loans program</a><br>
<i>&gt; suggests, as is collective responsibility.  The kid could not be forced to</i><br>
<i>&gt; honor the contract later on, but it would probably be very much in his</i><br>
<i>&gt; interest to do so, as his share value would be a bankable asset in getting</i><br>

<i>&gt; disallow the original contract than any corporation would be to basically</i><br>
<i>&gt; commit suicide and let the share prices go to zero.</a></i><br>

<p>
<a name="3662qlink4">I would suggest that the child can be forced but it would, in most
circumstances, not be in the best interest of the share holders.</a></a>

<p>
<a name="3450qlink4"><a href="3420.html#3443qlink4">&gt; To extend the range of discussion just a bit, one of the major problems</a><br>
<i>&gt; with our society and most world societies is the utter failure to bring</i><br>
<i>&gt; the family into the 20th Century, or even the 19th Century, much less the</i><br>
<i>&gt; 21st.  Families used to be economic units.  Parents invested in children</i><br>
<i>&gt; and expected a return - i.e., care in old age.  That gave them a major</i><br>
<i>&gt; incentive to have healthy, smart, productive, responsible kids.  When the</i><br>
<i>&gt; industrial revolution caused the breakdown of that economic unit, the</i><br>
<i>&gt; incentives were also largely lost.</i><br>

<p>
While I agree that child welfare and education should be in the form of
economic units I think the current family model is too restrictive.  I would
like to see room for more exotic methods of parenting.  I recently read an
article by Judith Rich Harris at Edge.org that stated that children are not
conditioned by their parents but by their peers.  While this confirms my</a> own
beliefs I do not think the conclusion - that children are genetically
inclined to learn from peers - is true.  In my opinion the family unit is
not rich enough to support the intellectual growth of a child.  If I am
wrong and the family unit just happens to be the most wonderful environment
possible for children then it will gain economic favour.

<p>

<p>
The rest of your post I agree with entirely.
