My own similar thinking about this terms was the reason for my testing the
waters with the term "ultrahuman" in my talk at Extro 4. I have still seen
only a small amount of feedback on the term, so don't yet have a good sense
of how people in our community respond to the term. I'm also especially
interested in how people outside our community respond to "ultrahuman" and
"ultrahumanism" compared to "posthuman" and "transhuman".

<p>
As I stressed in my talk, "The Ultrahuman Revolution: Amendments to the
Human Constitution", we can make a strong case that we are not doing away
with humanity, but refining it and augmenting it, building on our finest
qualities. This also helps to address the "it's not natural" objection by
arguing that it's central to human's nature to change nature.

<p>
I'm glad you quoted the FAQ definition. I will want to remove the term
"posthuman" from that definition, though I will wait until I have a better
sense of the responses to "ultrahuman".
