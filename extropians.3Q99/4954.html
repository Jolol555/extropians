I have found that many people feel there are questions that should not be asked, 
apparently because they are convinced that they already know the True Answer, or 
because asking the question invites other people to twist the results for their own 
purposes.  And if you propose to ask these questions, you are often met with 
accusations that you are racist, sexist, homophobic, or some other -ist or -ic.

  <li>  What significant genetic differences exist, if any, between American blacks and 
  African blacks?  Are there historic records detailing conscious strategies for 
  selecting which slaves to breed?

  <li>  What physical or genetic differences exist, if any, between homosexuals and
  heterosexuals?  Can someone consciously choose a sexual orientation?

  <li>  What differences exist, if any, in the learning styles and intelligence modalities 
  between different ethnic groups, or between women and men, both within and 
  across different countries?

One position is Arthur Kantrowitz's, who argues that in science and in public 
policy we must always determine what the facts are first, before any considerations 
of values come in.
