I talk with people who believe tow or more contradictory things at once fairly
often. A lot of religions (or rather, religious people) are like this. "I
believe Lord, Help thou my disbelief" and so forth. C.f. Orwell: doublethink.

<p>
Granted, an internally inconsistent worldview probably isn't the same thing as a
quantum superposition of opinions, but who's to say. On evidence, Penrose
notwithstanding, human consciousness doesn't seem to need quantum effects
[Someone here I think pointed out that if this were the case, MRI scanners would
be very very dangerous]. I agree that "consciousness" built around said quantum
effects would be a fairly bizarre thing.

<p>
There's another item for that "Transhuman Purity Test" somebody made. Right
after "Have you ever carked yourself into a planetary economy", "Have you ever
carked yourself into a quantum computer - How many of you came out?" :)
