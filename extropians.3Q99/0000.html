...Yes sir!  And size is a lesser factor in component and system cost.

   And a really wide second stage nozzle can be a corrugated stainless
   steel cone, wrapped around the first stage.  Pc=75PSI!</a>

Hoooboy, the human who could safely fly that would be one steely eyed
heroic type!  Though, I think if you asked for a pilot, you'd get 2,000
volunteers.
