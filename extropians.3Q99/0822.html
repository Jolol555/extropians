<p>
I believe I participated in a discussion of this a year or two ago, but I'd
like to start another thread on macroengineering -- this time doing it on
the cheap.  I think, e.g., that the East African Rift Valley could be turned
<a name="0829qlink1">into an inland sea similar to the Mediterranean</a> with a little work.

<p>
<a name="0829qlink2">In fact, it would seem, if my readings are correct, that just a tiny amount
of excavation at it's northern extremity would start the process whereby
waters from the Red Sea would flood a portion</a> of the Rift Valley.

<p>
<a name="0826qlink1">Now, with regards to this, there are some problems.  One is moral.  The
impact of such a change would be far reaching and would affect the lives of
humans and nonhuman animals, probably adversely in the case of the latter.
Add to this the affect on the region's weather patterns and the like.</a>

<p>
Another is whether this would work.  Could a few well placed explosive
charges actually begin this process?  Or would it require much more effort
because, e.g., lots of water might evaporate before have a large scale
impact?

<p>
I look forward to your comments.
