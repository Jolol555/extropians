Actually, IMHO, people got laid a lot more and talked about it less back
then than now.</a> The whole myth of 'saving' one's self for marriage was

<i>&gt; </i><br>

<i>&gt; what hungry is and can figure out how to put an end to hungry.  I doubt it</i><br>
<i>&gt; could care less whether this be by 'supermarket' or 'hunting'.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="4719qlink1"><a name="4694qlink3"><a name="4676qlink1"><i>&gt;From my experience it has little to do with being hungry. Its a matter</i><br>
of working the brain in its natural environment, giving it a complex
problem of tracking and stalking another creature that has been evolved
to avoid your best efforts. Making the kill at that point may or may not
be necessary.<a name="4663qlink5"> A centralized agricultural society may have been developed
</a>
</a>
to work in such a way as to allow a hunting recreation, but industrial
society is not built for man or to permit him to fulfill his need for
the hunt, as illustrated by the prevalence of serial killers in the
urban environment, etc., much of it tries to force man into the most
economically efficient box.</a>

<a href="4601.html#4656qlink3">&gt; &gt; This is statistically supported by studies that have shown that active</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; hunters have the lowest incidence of criminal behavior of any segment of</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; the population.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; I bet active hunters tend to live in areas that have low incidences of</i><br>

<p>
Actually, its irrelevant whether the hunters come from urban or rural
settings.
