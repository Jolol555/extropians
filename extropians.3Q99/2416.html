Wrong. Loss rate of oxygen and nitrogen from Mars' atmosphere would
have a time constant in the tens of millions to hundreds of millions
of years.  A primary goal would be to create an oxygen-bearing
atmosphere quickly so that an ozone layer would form, producing a
stratospheric cold trap. This would prevent water vapor from
reaching the ionosphere to be photodissociated and the hydrogen
lost- this is the real concern, but solvable.

<i>&gt; build taller buildings.</i><br>

<p>
Cheaper, true, but the land area of Mars (without seas) is equal to
the land area of earth.  Higher cost, higher return- and economics
after nanotech are debatable...

<i>&gt; it would take at least 6 months to reach mars.</i><br>

<p>
Wrong.  Six month transfer times can be achieved with Hohman
transfer orbits; at one gee Mars would be only days away.

<p>
           d=(1/2)at^2  rearranging:  t=sqrt(2d/a)

<p>
if a=10 m/s, d=50E6 km = 50E9 m  (half of distance to Mars), then
t=100,000 s to midpoint, 200,000 s for full trip; 2.3 days total.

<p>
&gt; 4.  There is no infastructure, and no one to live with.<br>

<p>
So you bring them from Earth and elsewhere.  I'd personally prefer
to leave Bob Zubrin behind, though, he's just too damn abrasive ;)
 
<p>
<a href="2408.html#2416qlink4">&gt; 5.  Everyone benifits from teraforming, no matter who pays.</a><br>

<p>
Ever heard of membership fees?  Property rights would have to be
arranged beforehand, but immigrants would likely have to pay to
join. None of this "common heritage of all mankind" bullshit, Mars
would be privately owned.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2416qlink5">&gt; 6.  No one on earth will allow the transfer of oxygen.</a><br>

<p>
You really have no clue as to how terraforming would be done, do
you? The main premise is to use resources *not* taken from Earth,
and it may be possible to terraform Mars without bringing in more
material (such as comets) from elsewhere.  Warming, melting, and
chemical transformation (reduction of CO2 to biomass and O2) would
be key points.
 
<p>
<a href="2408.html#2416qlink6">&gt; 7.  A teraformed planet may require matenance.</a><br>

<p>
Yep.  So?  Earth could use some major maintenance too, but nobody is
doing it.  Even without ongoing work, a fully terraformed planet
should remain viable for millions of years before "running down". 
Mars apparently has little tectonic recycling, so minerals would not
be returned to the biosphere via volcanoes as they are on Earth, but
robust self-replicating systems might be built to serve the purpose.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2416qlink7">&gt; 8.  It is too big of a project for any corporation or nation to</a><br>
<i>&gt; pay for it.</i><br>

<p>
At this time, yes.  After a few economic doubling periods, it would
be within the reach of wealthy individuals.  Greed is good ;)

<p>
Read up on terraforming, think about it some more, and do some basic
calculations before you make oracular pronouncements, friend.  And
you might try using a spellchecker, too- you have some really
obvious errors.
