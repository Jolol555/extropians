<p>
So, one sol-second of mass, 4.2e9 kg, would give a lifetime of 2.2E11
seconds, or 7200 years.  A useful size...

<p>
I couldn't figure out that glyph to the left of the "G" in equation 9, but
extrapolating from your calculation below, I get T=1E23/M, so the 4 Mtonne
hole is at "only" 2.3E13 K.  Egad, the gammas must fizz out into positrons
and electrons spontaneously... as Eugene Leitl pointed out, the beams used
to make the hole would dissipate their energy in making particles out of
the vacuum.

<p>
Well, yeah, but if you're playing with a dyson sphere, 1000 tonnes of
energy is trivial- less than a microsecond's worth of throughput.
 
<p>
<a href="2628.html#2637qlink3">&gt; The real problem though is to pack this energy into the required small</a><br>

<i>&gt; be packed into 10^-21 meters, much smaller than the nucleus of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; atom.</i><br>

<p>
...and the larger hole would be a whopping 4000 times bigger, at 4E-18
meters *still* much smaller than a nucleon.
 
<p>
<a href="2628.html#2637qlink4">&gt; Also, black hole temperature is inversely proportional to mass,</a><br>
<i>&gt; and according to the web page about the 10^6 kg black hole would</i><br>
<i>&gt; be about 10^17 K, which is hot hot hot (although coming from a</i><br>
<i>&gt; tiny area.).</i><br>

<p>
At 3E-35 m2, that's about 3E-7 barns.  That qualifies as tiny, all right. 

<p>
I'll stick with the technology I know, at mere hundreds of megawatts per
square meter.
