I agree there is an analogy, but there are also some differences worth
pursuing.  For education, one can get a long way with a one-dimensional
model: we all vary in our one-dimensional "ability", and education helps
us signal that ability, and sometimes helps us to raise it.  The fact that
you went to a good school and took hard subjects counts more that what
school and what subject.

<p>
<a name="4787qlink1">In art, multiple dimensions seem more salient.  There seem to be many
things people are trying to signal, and these signals interact in more
complex ways.  In some ways people seem to signal raw artistic ability,
the sort of ability that doesn't change much with time or context.
And in other ways people seem to be signaling their wealth and free
time.<a name="4774qlink1">  Rapid changes in art also suggest to me that people are signaling
the quality of their social information, showing that they find out
before others what's going to be "hot."  And different communities have
different ideas of "hot," suggesting that people are also trying to
signal allegiance to various groups.  But what exactly determines the
group that one feels allied to, I have little idea.  It all seems
very complex, and so very interesting.</a>
