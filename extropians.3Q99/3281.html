<p>
Here is script form of a dilbert comic involving cryonics.

<p>
Boss: I've Just arranged to have my body cryogenically frozen before death. 
In one hundred years, Ill be cured and revived. That way future generations 
will have the benefit of knowing me.

<p>
Wally: I hope you have a good warm coat.

<p>
Boss: They never said anything about that.

<p>
Wally: Of course you'll need a coat! It's freezing in that chamber. You'll 
also need some long underwear. And don't let them tell you otherwise. 
Remember, the customer is always right!

<p>
Boss (walking away, thinks): I'll want a space heater in there, too.

<p>
Dilbert (to Wally): That wasn't very nice.

<p>
Wally: I did it for future generations.

<p>
Thank you Scott Adams for that Wonderful comic!
