might look like after nan - let me know)

Thank you!  You must mean Acrosanti, which is Paolo something or other's 
solar powered mecca....yeah, in fact i visited his 'vision in the desert' 
this summer, for my birthday. I also went to the Biltmore in AZ a F.L.W. 
masterpiece, and Taliesin West.
<br>
Unfortunately at Arcosanti, they are very much "hippies" and weren't very 
focused and even more importantly INSURED, and some disasters happened which 
caused the whole thing to come to a grinding halt. They refuse any money from 
foundations or corperations, to keep the vision "pure" They sell bells and 
tiles to support themselves, hardly enough money to keep the colony going, 
much less build grandiose high-rises....  Sad. But still *very* cool.

Yeah, mind boggling isn't it? I vote for "soft-blurry-floating-light city" I 
have been formulating a future-cities art series for years, unable to make up 
my mind even what to BEGIN with!!  Then I read Drexler and it got even more

<a href="4696.html#4701qlink1">    &gt; whether we explore all of these</a><br>

<p>
The block will not be us deciding it is meaningless. People fear "going out 
of the box" for psychological reasons. Even Wright had to flat out lie to his 
clients and/or haggle and cajole them into doing things differently. 

<p>
<a name="4782qlink1">As Natasha Vita More points out in her lecture &amp; book, the decision is really 
</a>
<a name="4782qlink2">whether to learn and explore aesthetics and art and architecture as a core 
</a>subject. Finding meaning in aesthetics is a learned thing, a skill, which 
fine tunes the individual, and enhances other areas of study. For whatever 
reason (&amp; I have my guesses) people shy away from it, considering it 
"meaningless" or as we say in the arts education field, "fluff" or "desert." 
This is a faux pas.

<p>
    &gt;Would you want to live in a city<br>
<br>
    that through its fundamental architecture promotes violence
    or adventure (crim-city, insan-city), or extreme regularity
    and safety (bordo-city) or simply chaos (randomo-city)?
 &gt;


<p>
At 14, I had a dream about this. Game cities. For the extremely jaded. 
Themes. Reincarnation at death. ..extra lives for finishing levels, etc ; - ) 

<p>
<a href="4696.html#4701qlink2">    &gt;And would you want to live in a city at all, if instead</a><br>
    you can be uploaded and live in any virtua-city? &gt;&gt;

<p>
Well, actually it is even more intriguing in that case, and you better have 
some damn good animators on board.... without the limitations of physics *at 
all* , what do  our environments reflect, except our pure essence?
