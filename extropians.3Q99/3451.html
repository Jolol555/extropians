<a href="3407.html#3451qlink1">&gt; Sorry to disappoint you, but you are actually very normal. The original</a><br>
<i>&gt; 1956 paper by George Miller used a 7 item limit more for rhetorical device</i><br>
<i>&gt; than because it was that close to actual limits in humans. Since then it</i><br>
<i>&gt; appears that we have two limits: one associated with phonological</i><br>
<i>&gt; short-term memory and another with visual short-term memory (VSTM).</i><br>
<i>&gt; Phonological short-term memory appears to hold about 2 seconds of</i><br>
<i>&gt; information so if you thinking in Welsh you can hold far fewer words than</i><br>
<i>&gt; if you are thinking in Chinese. VSTM appears to hold around 4, but there is</i><br>
<i>&gt; some variation. In experiments I have been doing for my dissertation I</i><br>
<i>&gt; regularly find subjects that appear to have capacity limits up around 7-8</i><br>
<i>&gt; and others down around 2-3. My own belief is that this is probably an</i><br>
<i>&gt; attentional limit as well (there are various studies suggesting that we can</i><br>
<i>&gt; only attend to about 4 items at a time). There is some disagreement as to</i><br>
<i>&gt; where this limit might be many posit something akin to a high-level buffer</i><br>
<i>&gt; than can only hold an absolute number of items (around 4-5).</i><br>

<p>
Which is probably why I can do a large number of items, since taking
speed reading training. Rather than focusing on a single digit at a
time, treat the whole sequence of digits as one character or image. THis
is why the dashes in a phone number are great, as you can treat each
group of three or four digits as one item. Doing this, remembering a ten
digit number from a single glance is easy. My only problem is
remembering that that ten digit number is associated with a particular
person... ;) I have to look up the area code and exchange of where they
live, which usually allows me to recall the last four digits, so long as
I haven't tried to store too many different numbers that are in that
exchange... Once I've used that number for that person four or more
times its pretty automatic...
