<a name="0683qlink1">Hello all,

<p>
I just want to say that within Christian thought (and I have seen this in 
real life too) death bed repentance may not be the great way to "have your 
cake and eat it" that some think.  There is the doctrine that the spirit of 
Christ does not always strive with people when they have repeatedly pushed 
away the promptings that they need to repent.  They may very well reach the 
point of no return where they are so mired in sin and certain attitudes that 
they will no longer have the desire to repent even on their death bed.  And 
as stated often people die suddenly and have no time to repent.

<p>
And repentance is more then a quick little prayer but a real letting go of 
old ways and attitudes that denotes real desire to change.  God can see the 
real nature of our hearts.  As a Latter-day Saint I believe that their are 
various degrees and levels in Heaven and that only those that really lived 
for God will get to dwell in the highest level with God and certainly</a> not 
only lds people will be there; in fact many won't.  We also believe that 
before birth we lived in Heaven with God as adult spirits where we developed 
our personalities and talents in a multitude of ways.  I suppose many of you 
here spent all your time in the science section of the divine library!  
Mormons believe that only the most wicked and heinous will wind up in hell 
with the satan and his angels.  Hitler and Stalin I am sure would have their 
accommodations there.

<p>
I realize there are many nonbelievers on this list but I am just sharing my 
beliefs with you.  Do I know without any doubt that this is true; no I do 
not.  Mormons believe that the spirit of God lets people know the truth of 
these things for themselves through the mind and the heart but this takes 
someone being willing to do their own experiment by faith, study and 
application.  By this I have gained what I consider my belief in God and the 
afterlife.

<p>
And yet because I do not have a perfect knowledge of God I cling to this 
life that I know.  I am angry at the unfairness of mortality in terms of the 
inequality regarding intelligence, beauty, health and wealth among the 
population.  I want to see things straightened out here in this life and not 
just wait for the next.  I feel the human lifespan is just too short and 
that cryonics may give me the extra time I want.  Even as a nanobot filled 
immortal I will not go on forever; death will eventually claim me and 
uploaded copies of me as replacements holds no appeal to me.

<p>
So perhaps I hedge my bets.  It makes me feel guilty to do so but I want my 
chance in life!  I suffer from clinical depression (I take meds but no 
breakthrough yet), a.d.d., and worst of all learning disabilities that have 
stopped me so far from doing well in math and worst of all driving a car 
which is a huge frustration for me and  cost me dearly professionally and 
with women.  My father left my mother and I when I was a baby and I grew up 
without him.  I still bear emotional scars from that despite being reunited 
over the phone with him.  The damage is done and no apology has come.  He 
was extremely handsome but I did not inherit that key trait that can make 
life so much more pleasant.

<p>
I attend a local LDS singles adult ward and find it interesting that despite 
all the talk of living by Christ-like principles of love and kindness the 
same ruthless mating game rituals goes on there as anywhere else. Good-looks 
and money count just as much though being a faithful mormon guy is part of 
the bargain too.  I find the women friendlier in clubs and school dances 
then I do at the church dances.
<br>
A bishop(pastor) once explained it to me that the women are looking for 
mates so they are extremely particular.  I recently went through an online 
lds personals site and was surprised by all the women who were very 
attractive, in their thirties and never married even though certainly 
society is changing in that people wait longer to marry which is generally 
good.  I just wondered how many of these women were 'untouched' sexually 
since chastity is so emphasized in my church  (my male sexual strategies are 
showing themselves!).  It saddens me somewhat to think alot of people 
abstain from sex in their prime years(I am one who did) when they could have 
enjoyed their bodies and a partner so many times by making love over those 
years.  But they do this to live with their conscience and belief system.  I 
am not recommending promiscuity though since that can have it's own problems 
and heartaches.  I suppose the answer for me would have been marrying in my 
mid-twenties to have a partner had I been ready for one at that stage.

<p>
So many more have had it worse then me I realize but then so many more have 
had it much better.  I find myself sometimes criticized by people who are so 
blessed in comparison to me and have no right to talk.  I want a brain free 
of the flaws mine has and a handsome body on par with my fathers.  I want to 
be able to without agony learn math and to especially be able to drive a 
car.  I realize I must simply do the best with the hand of cards life dealt 
me but I tend to dwell on the negative and give up in frustration and 
embarrassment.

<p>
<a name="0683qlink2">I realize I have talked about these things before but they are dear to my 
heart.  I wish I could attend the Extro but it looks like finances will not 
allow it this year so I will have to attend the one in 2000. I look forward 
to whatever thoughts any of you might have on my comments.  I wish you all 
the best.
</a>
<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
