In my humble opinion as well.  This is a point I've been meaning to return 
to, in response to the issue of "wasted money of a false unknown."  The 
Cydonia region, like Iive said, was prioritized by NASA before anyone knew 
there was a "Face" there, and it has been long believed that Cydonia is more 
likely than other regions on Mars to contain water.

<p>
In a wonderfully ironic touch, it was a photo of the region demanded by those 
"nut-cases," The Society for Planetary SETI Research, that vindicated a 
mainstream geological theory.

<p>
Sp yes, Cydonia is a payoff, ET or not.  One of the comments that sticks in 
my head after the new "Face" was returned was made by a skeptical martian 
geologist: "I _wish_ the Face was artificial so I could explain it" (i.e. the 
natural mechanisms that created it).

<p>
It could very well be a rock.  But I'm tired of these overkill denouncements 
of "boring rock" and "ordinary rock."  It could very well be a sort of 
aerological Rosetta stone.
