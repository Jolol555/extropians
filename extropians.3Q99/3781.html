Yes, and I too am the very last person who should have spoken out,
considering some of the stuff I have posted, but honest to god it was
with malice towards none.<a name="3797qlink1">  Blaming American women for electing

Im in a spot here, for it was I who went on and on about turning off
internal censors when posting, saying what you really feel, etc.  Then I
go jump Mike.  So.  I pondered my own comment for much of the
day today.  I still dont know how to balance the honesty available
on the internet with common decency.  When one goes off on a
comedic riff, one looks around to see how the joke is going down.
With the internet, such a thing is not available.  spike
