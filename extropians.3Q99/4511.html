would the rest of you feel more kindly towards us anyway? The answer is no.

<a name="4524qlink2">Heinlein was basically a cranky old schmuck, with a huge amount of egotism, 
which included "wrap yourself in the American Flag '  patriotism/jingoism.  
But he was also a brilliant conceptualist and consistent, forward-thinking 
writer who was excellent at portraying human frailties and envy, which is 
part of the human (transhuman?) condition.  At times, he was also capable of 
righting 'ripping good tales' made more believable with their consistency.
