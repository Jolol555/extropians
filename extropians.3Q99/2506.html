<i>    &gt;&gt;Aristotle had a wife, he could have counted her teeth at any time but</i><br>
<i>    &gt;&gt;never bothered  to because he already knew the truth, or thought he did.</i><br>

I think I got that from one of Bertrand Russell's books, probably
"A History Of Western Philosophy" or "Wisdom Of The West".
I could never get through Aristotle myself, his writing style is terrible,
much more turgid than his teacher Plato, and the more I learned about
him the less willing I was to go through the torture. He did some good
</a>
stuff in logic and he was an OK biologist, but his physics was a joke
and his contempt for experiment held back science for many years.
