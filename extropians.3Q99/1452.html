<p>
Enhanced bones are stage 6 technology
<br>
on your scale via use of drugs such as alendronate &amp; calcitonin in
conjunction with training.  Actually, this is almost stage 7.

<p>
Enhanced musculature is stage 5, via the use of gene therapy to increase
the production of IGLF;  mice have gained 37% muscle mass in this
fashion.

<p>
To reduce damage from high impact strikes, martial artists develop THICK
callus layers;  the martial arts advisor on _Matrix_ has knuckles that
look like the striking surface of a hammer.  Level 7, overall.

<p>
Enhanced reaction time will result from enhanced musculature, to some
extent, &amp; from simple chemical stimulants.  Lvl 7.

<p>
Martial arts training to coordinate all of the above;  lvl 7.

<p>
All this combines to produce a person able to punch thru a wall if
exerting full power.  It could basically be done in a few years.
To produce someone able to do this *casually*, level 3 or 4.  Muscle
proteins
<br>
spliced with spider silk are probably the best path for this approach,
with muscle arrangements based on chimps (not too dissimilar to humans
but *much* stronger)
<br>
with appropriate bone strengthening chemical treatments as above.
