as a foreigner reading this discussion, realising that ordinary Americans
believe that they should be able to attack any other country which annoys
them, for any reason, and if that other country decides to defend itself with 
the only effective weapons it has, those Americans believe that they are
perfectly justified in vaporizing foreign cities containing millions of
civilians in retaliation.</a></a>

arrogance looks to non-Americans (and if that fails, go rent 'Starship 
Troopers'; the best satire on American militarism I've ever seen). You may
suddenly realise just why so many non-Americans fear and hate you.
