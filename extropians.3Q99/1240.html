&lt;SNIP debate on what we mean by intelligence and whether IQ is valid&gt;

<p>
On a more down to earth level...

<p>
Caffeine helps alertness (no sh*t) and in moderate amounts, there doesn't
seem to be much evidence for toxicity. When I seriously need it, I take it
in pill form (available in any drug store) so as to avoid all other crap
that's in coffee and soft drinks. I sometimes take ephedrine (minithins,
available in many convenience stores and truck stops) to increase
alertness, improve mood, and overcome procrastination. I've observed that
after taking a lot of ephedrine I get very irritable as the mood elevation
wears off. For a while I did ritalin (prescription drug for treating
hyperactivity/ADD) and to me it felt more or less like ephedrine, but not
as strong.

<p>
When I do this, I'm probably harming my health. It's a tradeoff. I get
what I need done right now, and promise myself not to get into these "due
yesterday" situations in the future. Obviously I don't pop pills every
day.

<p>
This is probably not an intelligence boost as you define it, but the
question is, what is it that you're planning to use your intelligence for?
I use mine to: 1) solve computer problems and 2) cram large numbers of
gerontology papers into my brain. My main problem is being scared of the
magnitude of work in front of me and going into denial. Chemically
enhanced alertness and mood help prevent this.

<p>
All the above is my individual, anecdotal, subjective experience. It might
all be placebo effect, and may affect you in a different way if at all.
YMMV
