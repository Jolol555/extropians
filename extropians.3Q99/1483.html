From: Scott Badger &lt;wbadger@psyberlink.net&gt;
<br>
<a href="1458.html#1483qlink1">&gt;I saw the first in a series of 8 of these last week.  It was about the</a><br>
<i>&gt;quirky human fascination with time-saving devices.  Like how orange juice</i><br>
<i>&gt;went from being packaged in a half gallon paper container with the tear</i><br>
open
<br>
<a href="1458.html#1483qlink2">&gt;side to a container with a twist off cap on the side to a container with a</a><br>
<i>&gt;pull-tab opener.  Another example was how manufacturers of cd players were</i><br>
<i>&gt;now including a feature where one can reduce the usual 3 seconds between</i><br>
<i>&gt;songs down to 1 second.  Why wait?  You have better things to do with your</i><br>
<i>&gt;time!  I'm not so sure we're as fascinated with saving time as we are</i><br>
<i>&gt;manipulated by corporate product managers who feed on our obvious desire</i><br>
for
<br>
<a href="1458.html#1483qlink3">&gt;"new and improved" products.  Ted Koppel made a paternal-like appearance at</a><br>
<i>&gt;the end of the show and voiced his opinion that we are caught in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;technological tyranny.</i><br>

<p>
I think the time-saving devices segment intended to point out that a part of
the human brain measures and compares the time it takes for various
operations to complete. A fraction of a second saved by one method means
that another (longer) method results in the brain having to wait out the
extra time -- and feeling bored for that amount of time. So, every new and
faster technology eventually supplants older versions, even if the
difference only amounts to a fraction of a second, because users (customers
and buyers) get used to faster products and services (and get impatient with
the old products/services).

<p>
(Koppel struggles under the technological tyranny of his hairpiece.)
