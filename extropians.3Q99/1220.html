Sure.  And maybe every human being on Earth will decide to have Cheerios 
for breakfast every day for the next million years.

Again, it doesn't matter if "many", or "most", or even "99.99999%" of all 
races do something that would make them invisible to us.  What you're 
looking for is an absolutely airtight, 100% guaranteed, absolutely escape 
proof mechanism for making them invisible.  If you don't have</a> that, you 
still have to explain why that occasional oddball species (or splinter 
group, or individual) that decides to stick around isn't busily rearranging 
the cosmos.

<p>
If you are serious about adressing the problem of the Great Science, one of 
the first things you have to do is stop plugging arbitrary numbers into the 
Drake equation.  That kind of speculation is fun, but it is utterly useless 
for estimating the number of sentient races that actually exist.  As long 
as you are assigning arbitrary, reasonable-sounding numbers to those terms, 
you are pretty much certain to be wrong.  For all we know, one of those   
tems could be 10^-20.
