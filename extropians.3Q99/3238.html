<a name="3254qlink2">Hear, hear!  I think that Singularitarianism is better than
transhumanism, and I think that Externalist Singularitarianism (there's
a mouthful) is better than ordinary Singularitarianism.  If I didn't
believe that, I wouldn't be one.  Yes, I think my philosophy is better
than your philosophy.  I think it has greater logical rigor and promotes
stronger minds.  That's what it's all about:  There *Is* A Better Way.</a> 
<a name="3254qlink3">den Otter thinks selfishness is superior to Externalism,</a> and does this
threaten me?  It neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket.

<a name="3254qlink4">It's time to admit that some philosophies are better than others.  "My
philosophy is better than your philosophy" is not a statement of
inherent moral superiority, or an insult to the other, but an attempt to
create and transmit a Better Way - no different from "My design for
active shields is better than your design for active shields."</a>

<p>
Is Extropianism better than general transhumanism?  I haven't
particularly noticed.  But if anyone feels it is, then come out and say why!
