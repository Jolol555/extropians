are

I think this is a worthwhile project, although I think this is really more of 
an "opinion poll" than a "personality test".  Perhaps we could use one of the 
free opinion poll services.  I think your categories are about right, but 
think each one has three elements: What the responder thinks is best for 
humanity as a whole, what is most probable and what the responder prefers for 
herself personally.  I agree with you that we're likely headed for the 
equivalent of a "Cambrian Explosion" of our own species, with a great 
diversity of developmental pathways being generated by the possibilities 
presented by transhuman technologies.  If this is so, it WOULD be good to be 
able to know who's on a similar pathway.
