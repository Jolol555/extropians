Well, as you indicate E.O. Wilson and others "talk" to insects through their 
work on pheromone signaling.  Comparing the content of the conversation that 
takes place in that endeavor to, say, Shakespeare, your point is well taken.  
<a name="0533qlink1">But the point is that some small number of humans DO go to the trouble and 
endure the "boredom" of the content of the conversation for the simple sake 
of learning a little bit.</a>

Perhap I'm easily amused :-)

{WARNING: THE FOLLOWING MATERIAL CONTAINS WILD SPECULATION; VALID POETIC 
LICENSE REQUIRED.} Those limits may well make the decisive difference.  You 
<a name="0533qlink2">made the chillingly apt point when we discussed this in Palo Alto that many, 
if not most SIs might spend the vast majority of their time in "suspend mode" 
out of what amounted to a god-like boredom.</a>  I don't doubt that that may be 
true for most.<a name="0533qlink3">  But I can also imagine a situation in which an SI might 
create various subparts of itself with lesser levels of intelligence, perhaps 
a myriad of such subdivisions, each with slightly different capacities for 
interest and engagement in various subjects.  Managing this hierarchy of 
sub-intelligences might be the ultimate business of the ultimate SIs.</a>

<p>
Here I can't help but getting another chilling thought: Consider the Hindu 
theodicy. In its most refined form, Hindu theology posits a unitary god, 
Brahma, who essentially "plays games with himself" by partitioning his being 
into lesser subparts who have more or less unity with his "ultimate" self and 
more or less knowledge of the nature of the "game".  In this view, we are all 
really aspects of Brahma, with Krishna being the gentle "messenger" who 
crosses levels of "god-nature" with the news that we're all really different, 
more or less aware parts of the ultimate god-mind.  Shiva ("the destroyer"), 
in this view, is the aspect of Brahma who erases the self-imposed limits in 
Brahma's cosmic game, from time to time "rebooting" more or less of the rules.

<p>
<a name="0533qlink4"><a name="0532qlink1">Perhaps, with cosmic time and ultimate computational resources on their 
<a name="0533qlink5">hands, at least some SIs will come to play the Brahma "god game".</a>  If so, 
then there will be perhaps many, many quite potent intelligences in the 
universe -- intelligent far beyond our current level -- but still not at any 
particular time fully in possession of all of the knowledge and power of a 
</a>
"complete", unitary SI.  Such "lesser deities" might well be interested in 
communicating with us -- in the gentle way of Krishna, or perhaps in the more 
dramatic ways that Shiva upsets the apple cart.  In this regard, there might 
be specifically-crafted "level crossers" that are intentionally "designed" to 
play that role in some SI's "god game", or who might evolve into that role on 
their own.</a>  This concept of a "level crossing" techno-transcendent 
intelligence is similar to Anton Sherwood's notion of the "extrosattva" I've 
written about before:

<p>
<a name="0533qlink6">While you make compelling arguments about the improbability of communication 
between SIs and animals with our level of intelligence, can you say that the 
scenario I describe above is impossible or even improbable?</a>
