<i>&gt; &gt;  /0 is chronically indeterminate.</i><br>

&gt; By what law?  Your own home grown laws?  <br>

<p>
Since math has nothing to do with reality, you are perfectly free
to make up any axioms you want and see where they lead.  If you happen
to pick axioms that assign a specific value to 0/0, then those axioms
will lead you into mathematical conclusions that are useless for
building bridges and airplanes that work, but you're free to do that.
If you want a bridge that won't collapse and kill people, however,
you'll soon figure out that you have to drag that "(where x &lt;&gt; 0)"
around with you like your junior high school algebra teacher said.
It might be fun and entertaining to prove that 6 = 2, but it won't
put any food on your table.
