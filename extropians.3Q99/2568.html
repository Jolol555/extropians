<a name="2825qlink1">I am posting separately a remarkable early application of Darwinian
ideas to the evolution of machines, which seems not to have attracted
the attention of this company.  It comprises three chapters of
_Erewhon_, a cheerfully satirical utopia published by Samuel Butler
(1835-1902) in 1872.  In their original form they had been published
as articles in a New Zealand newspaper from 1860 to 1864 -- just after
the _Origin of Species_ appeared &amp; Butler read it!

<p>
The asterisked footnotes are Butler's; I have inserted a few comments
in square brackets.

I thank Jim Fehlinger for using his scanner to reduce this text to
