<p>
This is an important question, but it is a bit different from the one I
was getting at. You are asking about the point of existence when we are
fundamentally different beings from those we are now. I'm asking whether
there is a solid foundation for the *desirability* of becoming
fundamentally different beings from those we are now. Almost everyone on
this list, it seems, finds the idea of becoming a fundamentally
different being desirable. Me too. But when I ask myself why, I can't
come up with very deep answers. "It will be great to be immortal"; "It
will be cool to be *really* smart"; "It will be fun to live on other
planets"; etc. But "it will be great" isn't a philosophical
justification. A friend of mine says the reason for life-extension is to
figure out the reason for life-extension. Maybe something similar
applies here, although that is still not a perfect answer.

<p>
Of course, if we answer *your* question, then mine will probably be
taken care of!

<p>

<a href="3313.html#3385qlink8">: Now, if the other possibility that seems to fit the available data</a><br>
<i>: is -- become an SI/AI, think about a philosopy for existence,</i><br>
<i>: realize that there is no philosopy (because survival *was*</i><br>
<i>: the purpose for existence and once survival is guaranteed,</i><br>
<i>: existence is pointless); dismantle yourself back into atoms.</i><br>
<i>: This seems to fit the paradox of "Why do we still see stars?".</i><br>

<p>
Yes, this is the possibility I think is likely.

<p>
Cheers,
