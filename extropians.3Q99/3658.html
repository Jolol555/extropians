<p>
In further support of your comments (IFSOYC):
Philosophy does not define the terms used in science. (Ex. gluon,
microtubule, quasar, etc.) Science not only defines its own terms, it
organizes them into a grid of empirically verifiable knowledge such that
anyone with sufficient intelligence and persistence can find out for
themselves, experimentally, physically, directly. Science discovers,
philosophy broods (IMNSHO). If you want to know the conditions of ultimate
truth, that very desire gets in the way of it. Self-knowledge occurs when
the observer becomes the observed. This surpasses logic and moves to direct
experience (i.e., science). You can verify this for yourself using what
subjective scientists generally call meditation (in English), which requires
no definition, only directions.
