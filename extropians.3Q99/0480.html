<a name="0511qlink1">The thing I don't understand is *when* you do this count.  Do the
programmers just keep a log of every mistake they make?  Do you count your
defects up after the product ships.  For instance, in this e-mail do</a> I count
<a name="0511qlink2">just the errors per line when I send it or while I'm typing (I just</a> went to
<a name="0511qlink3">type 'while' and started with an 'h' - 'started' just went through about
three different erroneous phases - 'phases' just came out as 'pahses' - I
just misspelled (correctly) the misspelling of 'phases'... and so on)?  In
short, when do you stop correcting and start counting?</a>

<p>
<a href="0446.html#0480qlink2">&gt; Unfortunately, there are good reasons why OpenDoc never went anywhere.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Your first problem is that it introduces truly horrendous user interface</i><br>
<i>&gt; problems.  Either the UI has to be capable of handling any possible</i><br>
<i>&gt; component (in which case the components will be too standardized to</i><br>
<i>&gt; allow for much innovation), or the components get to draw their own</i><br>
<i>&gt; windows (which leads to dialog-box hell).</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0511qlink4">The UI could handle any possibility but as I said the programmer</a> would have
<a name="0511qlink5">to be removed from the interface.  You would have to use a standardised
document object model so that, in the true spirit of Opendoc, components
acted on documents.  The UI would be a challenge for sure, but it's about
time someone did something in UI-design rather than just speculating about
the wonders of speech-recognition.  (Won't speech recognition interfaces
require this sort of component-based model anyway?)</a>

<p>
<a href="0446.html#0480qlink3">&gt; Your second problem is that most users don't want things to work that</a><br>
<i>&gt; way.  They don't want to have to figure out how to juggle the various</i><br>
<i>&gt; components on their computer, picking the right combination for whatever</i><br>
<i>&gt; it is they are doing at the moment.  They want you, the programmer, to</i><br>
<i>&gt; do that for them.  Thus, such a system doesn't have much appeal for</i><br>
<i>&gt; users.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0511qlink6">This requires self-organising interfaces.  Self-organising interfaces
require semantics-rich documents.  Semantics-rich documents require
context-aware user environments.  Context-aware user environments require
self-organising interfaces.</a>

<p>
<i>&gt; Since most programmers don't want it either (I'd rather invoke the</i><br>
<i>&gt; component through code), that doesn't leave you with much of a market.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0511qlink7">It's worth trying, I think.  What I'd like to see is a test-bed</a> for this and
<a name="0511qlink8">other ideas.  A semantics-rich context-aware self-organising user
environment with a hyperlinking file system.  I've got it all worked out,
now all I need is an army of programmers with too much time on their hands.
