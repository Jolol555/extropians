The vast majority of what you do is not a brute force pruning of a
search tree.  The vast majority of what you do is either conscious,
self-aware cognition, the execution of reflexes derived from previous
cognition, or the execution of instincts, emotions, and other perceptual
and cognitive processes which, though "autonomous" in the sense of not
requiring conscious direction, are nevertheless vastly more
sophisticated than Deep Blue.  For one thing, they have a *lot* more raw power.

<a name="3368qlink1">I'm not sure how you're defining "AI" here, but such a process certainly
wouldn't be "intelligent".  It would not be creative, self-modelling, or
capable of representing general content.  It wouldn't have goals or a
world-model except in the same way a thermostat does.  Deep Blue doesn't
know that it knows.</a>
