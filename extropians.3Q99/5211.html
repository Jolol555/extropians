Here's another question in a similar vein, how would it ever be possible
to unmerge Microsoft and Intel?  It would likely not be.

<p>
Economists vary, but many might posit that Intel and Microsoft comprise
a duopoly.  An issue with this is that there are still enough
competitors, and more or less always will be, that Wintel can not
exercise a monopoly's price fixing in the face of stringent
competition.  So, they more illustrate economies of scale and good long
term management than pure technical superiority, which engineers might
see differently than Microsoft.

<p>
That, that being the fact that a technical monopoly does not exist, or
if it does it is not leveraged to its full classical economic extent,
still does not change the fact that the Windows operating system is the
de facto platform run as a person's computer by a large majority of the
population.  Thus, it is kind of like the phone system, which happens to
be regulated.  By the same token, there should not be barriers to entry
in any shape or form, but it's not like there isn't already.
Considering Microsoft business tactics which are to steadily erode
competitors' foothold on the prevalent Win32 platform and in general
obvious and near insurmountable technical predisposition towards their
own products yield them with, for example, the Office suite, besides the
operating system.  Then, there is Internet Explorer, which has been
spot-welded onto Win32 quite ably.

<p>
So, Microsoft software on an Intel platform is in many ways the status
quo.  The problem is that they are a for-profit company (which is not in
itself a problem) that does not necessarily yield to its customers
(everybody's) best interests.

<p>
Back to the question asked, I think that merging Intel and Microsoft
operations would not be good for either, operationally.  I heard there
was an ongoing antitrust case against Microsoft, these things happen.
