I'm not sure how true the above is.  Anecdotally, we see Picasso screwing
around -- yet I hardly think his wealth and success measured well against a
lot of nonartists, especially those in business such as Bill Gates, Andrew
Carnegie, or Leona Helmsley.

<p>
Also, the appeal of art seems to fill some deeper human need.  A person with
a mate does not necessarily seek out an artist, nor does having a mate or
even several make one full of art.

<p>
I tend to think Ayn Rand was onto something in her _The Romantic Manifesto_
when she claimed art fills the need of a conceptual mind.  As far as we
know, no other animals are conceptual -- not to the degree humans are, at
least -- and no other animals have art.  (Anyone care to debate this
point?:)  This is a weak argument in her favor.  A stronger one is how
people react to art while animals do not.  And also how young children react
to art and how they create art.  Their art tends to home in on what they
view as essential, such as a child's drawing of a house or a person.  She
does not draw in every detail, just overall shape and relations, however
botched these might be.

<p>
Thus, I think art _essentializes_.  It grabs what the artist believes --
wittingly or not -- to be relevant and discards the irrelevant, which is
why, e.g., most novels don't have scenes of the characters urinating.
Typically, that activity is not relevant to the story.  (It can be, but
usually it's not.  For example, _Crime and Punishment_ has no such scenes in
it.  I daresay it would not be a better novel if it did.)  This is NOT to
claim the artist always gets it right, but I feel this is the aim and the
degree to which the artist pulls it off makes it pleasing -- at least to the
degree the consumer of art can perceive it.

<p>
The latter is a topic in itself.  Rand covered this too.  She basically
thought the process of artist creation was mirrored in artistic
appreciation.  It goes something like this.  The artist has universals to
communicate (again, knowingly or not).  She brings them together into a
particular form -- such as a poem or a painting.  The listener to or reader
of the poem and the viewer of the painting are able to see how the
particular fits together and from its rendering get those universals.

<p>
Rand's own novels and short stories are examples of this, though it might be
claimed she's just apologizing for her particular work.  However, her idea
seems applicable to a lot of art, from Greek tragedy -- Euripides'
"Hippolytus" shows us the tension between the demands of different godesses
(whether one believes in such things is another matter; Euripides and his
audience certainly thought them important, whether literally or
allegorically read) -- on.

<p>
Now, a natural question to ask, if this is so (and I'm not demanding we
believe it to be so; I hope someone will pick apart this idea in case it is
wrong:), is how does it relate to Extropianism and transhumanism?  I find it
easy to see how, though I fear a too literal reading of this will make
people on this list think art should then be propoganda -- viz., that we
have certain ideas to communicate and our art should completely follow
those.  My view is, however, that Rand's view is descriptive -- not
<pre>
prescriptive.  That is that one cannot take it and make art -- at least, not
art that would be of lasting value at this stage.  (As evidence of this,
witness how many of Rand's followers scribble out novels, short stories, and
</pre>
poems, yet little of it ever amounts to anything.)

<p>
Cheers!
