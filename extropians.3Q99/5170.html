Sometimes I get mail from you (like this one) that is set to 80 chars per
line and has "Kathryn Aegis" as the name and sometimes I get mail that has
no max chars and doesn't have the name field set.  Are you using two
different machines/OS's/mail programs to send e-mail?  If so, one of them is
set up and the other is not.  Not having a max number of chars set mostly
causes little problems (for instance with MS Outlook you have to alter the
quotes) but with some mail programs it can cause bigger, nastier problems.
Chaging some settings on your end could free-up whole seconds of extra time
that list members could dedicate to helping orphans.  You wouldn't want the
orphans to miss Christmas this year would you?
