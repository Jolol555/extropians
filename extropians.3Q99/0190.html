<a href="0166.html#0190qlink1">&gt;A question (for the female readers only) -- (given a, b &amp; c above)</a><br>
<i>&gt;would you "do" a man that you weren't particularly attracted to</i><br>
<i>&gt;but who was rated 7-10 as a sex partner by an independent panel</i><br>
<i>&gt;and who had a "biocompatible" immune system for the phase your</i><br>
<i>&gt;hormone cycle was in at the time you were in the man's proximity?</i><br>
<i>&gt;[We know the male answer, so there is no point in responding... :-)]</i><br>


<p>
<a name="0203qlink1">To me it seems ridiculous to think an 'independent panel' could rate a man
as a good sex partner.</a> A man is a good sex partner to a woman if they
<a name="0203qlink2">listen to each other and understand and appreciate each others' ideas.</a>
<a name="0203qlink3">Otherwise she wouldn't want to have sex with him (we are all generalizing
here, of course) so it wouldn't be any good.</a> If they want to have sex with
each other, they will of course give each other the necessary physical
information to make it good. Perhaps very good friends could guess if that
would work out for the two, but not an 'independent panel'.
