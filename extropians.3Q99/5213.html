     FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                    September 30, 1999

     MARS CLIMATE ORBITER TEAM FINDS LIKELY CAUSE OF LOSS

     A failure to recognize and correct an error in a transfer of 
</pre>
information between the Mars Climate Orbiter spacecraft team in 
Colorado and the mission navigation team in California led to the 
loss of the spacecraft last week, preliminary findings by NASA's 
Jet Propulsion Laboratory internal peer review indicate.

<p>
     "People sometimes make errors," said Dr. Edward Weiler, <br>
NASA's Associate Administrator for Space Science. "The problem 
here was not the error, it was the failure of NASA's systems 
engineering, and the checks and balances in our processes to 
detect the error.  That's why we lost the spacecraft."

<p>
     The peer review preliminary findings indicate that one team 
used English units (e.g., inches, feet and pounds) while the 
other used metric units for a key spacecraft operation.  This 
information was critical to the maneuvers required to place the 
spacecraft in the proper Mars orbit.  

<p>
     "Our inability to recognize and correct this simple error <br>
has had major implications," said Dr. Edward Stone, director of 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory.  "We have underway a thorough 
investigation to understand this issue."

<p>
     Two separate review committees have already been formed to 
investigate the loss of Mars Climate Orbiter: an internal JPL 
peer group and a special review board of JPL and outside experts. 
An independent NASA failure review board will be formed shortly.

<p>
     "Our clear short-term goal is to maximize the likelihood of <br>
a successful landing of the Mars Polar Lander on December 3," 
said Weiler. "The lessons from these reviews will be applied 
across the board in the future."

<p>
     Mars Climate Orbiter was one of a series of missions in a 
long-term program of Mars exploration managed by the Jet 
Propulsion Laboratory for NASA's Office of Space Science, 
Washington, DC.  JPL's industrial partner is Lockheed Martin 
Astronautics, Denver, CO.  JPL is a division of the California 
Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA.
