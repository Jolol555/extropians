I thought this recent post to the Randian-Feminism list (see
<a href="http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/femstart.htm">http://www.nyu.edu/projects/sciabarra/femstart.htm</a>) might be relevant to
this discussion.

<p>
Cheers!

<i>&gt; Subject:  Re: A father's obligation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Daniel Ust asked about the rights and responsibilities of the father who</i><br>
may
<br>
<i>&gt; not wish to have or support a child: In David Ross'es article</i><br>
<i>&gt; "Responsibility," which appeared in the May 1998 issue of "Navigator" Ross</i><br>
<i>&gt; lays out a cogent position on this matter.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Ross says that the "virtue of responsibility stands so high in the</i><br>
<i>&gt; Objectivist morality that the incantation to 'take responsibility' for</i><br>
one's
<br>
<i>&gt; actions has the potential to become a trap," and that "Objectivists should</i><br>
<i>&gt; not rush to assume responsibility" without first considering if it is</i><br>
proper to do so.

<p>
<i>&gt; He says that in our society, it is generally considered when planning for</i><br>
<i>&gt; the possibility of pregnancy that if the woman becomes pregnant "the man's</i><br>
<i>&gt; sperm who fertilized the egg is morally and financially responsible for</i><br>
the
<br>
<i>&gt; care of the child, should the woman decide to give birth." Ross says he</i><br>
<i>&gt; believes that assumption is wrong.</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; He notes that having a "clear concise agreement prior to having sex would</i><br>
be
<br>
<i>&gt; the responsible way to deal with the matter" and says that this is usually</i><br>
<i>&gt; not the case.  He says the "standard argument is that if a man engages in</i><br>
<i>&gt; sexual intercourse then he has tacitly chosen the obligation and that</i><br>
before
<br>
<i>&gt; safe abortions became routine this argument "may" have had force, but he</i><br>
is
<br>
<i>&gt; not convinced."</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; He argues that, " Sexual intercourse no longer brings the risk of having a</i><br>
<i>&gt; child; it only brings the risk of having an abortion." And "in the absence</i><br>
<i>&gt; of an explicit agreement, the only reasonable assumption for the man to</i><br>
make
<br>
<i>&gt; is that the woman does not intend to bear a child as a result of their</i><br>
<i>&gt; sexual involvement, and will look to him to share, at most, the cost of an</i><br>
<i>&gt; abortion if she becomes pregnant."</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; He continues, that considering the complexity involved in rearing a</i><br>
<i>&gt; child-the great financial and moral burden and the extensive preparation</i><br>
and
<br>
<i>&gt; long-range planning-when balanced against the simplicity of discussing the</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter explicitly ahead of time-it "makes no sense for a woman to conclude</i><br>
<i>&gt; that a man has assumed [responsibility] tacitly."</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; Ross refers to a woman's rights when he says, "Pregnancy is a condition of</i><br>
a
<br>
<i>&gt; woman's body, and the decision to continue or terminate a pregnancy is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; woman's alone.  That a man has had sexual intercourse with a woman does</i><br>
not
<br>
<i>&gt; give him any jurisdiction over her body, or mitigate her autonomy with</i><br>
<i>&gt; regard to abortion." And "this means that the child's existence is the</i><br>
<i>&gt; decision of the woman alone."</i><br>

<p>
<i>&gt; He notes that in 1976 the "US Supreme Court affirmed this principle, when</i><br>
it
<br>
<i>&gt; ruled unconstitutional a Missouri law requiring a woman seeking an</i><br>
abortion
<br>
<i>&gt; to get her husband's written consent." He says, that "unfortunately, that</i><br>
<i>&gt; decision has not persuaded lower courts to draw the logical conclusion:</i><br>
that
<br>
<i>&gt; a man has no responsibility for the outcome of a decision over which he</i><br>
has
<br>
<i>&gt; no control."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I agree wholeheartedly with David's position.</i><br>
