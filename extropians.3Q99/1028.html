<a name="1031qlink1">Assuming that the possibility of finding extraterrestrial artifacts on other 
bodies in our solar system isn't a lunatic notion, what sort of things 
_should_ we be looking</a> for?

Re. Cydonia: I found the URL below interesting, if for no other reason than 
it shows what part of Cydonia was rephotographed by the Mars Global Surveyor. 
 The Fort and D&amp;M object, as can be plainly seen, were _not_ imaged even 
remotely in their entirety.  Note the shape of the "Main City Pyramid" and 
the linear cuts around its base.  The bifurcated "terrace" (visible in the 
lower left) has also been the subject of some debate.

It is my personal theory (if Cydonia indeed has artificial structures) that 
the "pyramids" and "Face" are examples of modified terrain, which the 
hypothetical ETs constructed using pre-existing landforms.  The faceted 
structure of the "Main City Pyramid" and "D&amp;M Pyramid," for example, could be 
a modification used to maximize use of sunlight.

<p>
It doesn't particularly bother me that these formations look "rough."  
They're _old_ and radically weathered, and quite likely carved out of 
existing formations.  Consider our plans for moon bases, which call for 
literally burying habitat modules under the regolith to shield from radiation.
