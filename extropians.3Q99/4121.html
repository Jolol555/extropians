<p>
    This manifesto talks about an important trend- one that extropians will 
eventually have to work into the extropian principles in some way- but its 
author seems to be grasping at straws in suggesting that Marxist ideology is 
supported by free software, etc.  Obviously the trend so far only applies to 
software &amp; some types of information, but this will likely change.
<p>
    As nanotech, biotech, intelligent agents, etc. become increasingly 
available the range of products that can be digitally distributed will 
increase as well.  Furthermore, there will be more and more new modes for 
advertising, co-branding, etc.  It is now possible to get a basic PC for a 
few hundred $$ and get free email, Websites &amp; Internet access
<br>
(ad-supported).  Or, commit to paying $20-30 monthly for an ISP &amp; get the <br>
basic computer free.  It is also possible to earn money/credits  (albeit 
usually small amounts) for browsing, reading commercial emails, visiting 
sponser sites, looking at ad banners, etc.  And it seems like every Web 
merchant and her brother offer affiliate programs
these days.  So, where does this point for the future?
<p>
    Very likely, to many, many goods &amp; services (largely automated) being 
offered free or nearly so.  People might have a  free house grown for them 
on the condition that occupants and visitors put up with pop-up advertising 
holograms.  Health care might be run the same way(as David Friedman 
suggested); food and many other "basic" items (which will probably include 
much that we'd consider luxury) could have ads tagged onto them; people 
could earn modest amounts of credit for voluntarily viewing additional ads; 
etc, etc.  What that ends in is not Marxism, but a kind of 
left-libertarianism existing within the free market framework.  People might 
live quite well on open-source goods supported by commercial advertising, 
perhaps supplementing this with any creative work/sales/referrals they do.
<p>
    It is also worth noting that, although open-source digital goods are 
free (or very cheap) service/support for those goods is still a scarce 
commodity.  This may change in the future; nonsentient AI or ad-supported 
"free" support might develop for many goods/services. It may become possible 
for those who don't insist on the "latest &amp; greatest" to live quite well 
with little or no work, without burdening or coercing others.  Those who are 
still inclined to pursue serious work/entreprenuership would subsidize them 
voluntarily...by buying ads in/on their nano-engineered house.  Or inside 
their VR pod.  Or their
<br>
all-purpose vehicle(good out to lunar distances). Or even their brains
<br>
(allow us to use 10% of your grey matter for hosting ads &amp; project them to <br>
others via holograms over your head, &amp; we'll give you these nifty body/mind 
upgrades for free...).
<p>
    So, we have a kind of cyber-agorism that contains a significant amount 
of cyber-anarchism(in the leftist sense) but, no, it isn't "cyber-communism" 
<br>
(With some of the things he says, I find it disingenuous of the author to <br>
quote Marxists (very selectively) to make his case.  Is he really so wrapped 
up in orthodoxy as not to have heard of Peter Kropotkin? Alexander Berkman? 
Murray Bookchin? To say nothing of David Friedman...:-)  All these 
individuals (and they're just a few off the top of my head) offer cogent 
explanations, with varying strengths, weaknesses, and degrees of accuracy, 
of the kind of "cyber-leftish" phenomena developing on the Net &amp; in the 
open-source community, and almost certain to continue &amp; intensify as we 
progress toward nanoengineered "digital matter" and related technologies of 
abundance.
