<a href="0919.html#0925qlink1">&gt; &gt; That said, what I am really looking at here is the implications of</a><br>
<i>&gt; mating</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; behavior to evolution, the future of the race, etc.  Consider the first</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; humans vs the very similar chimps.  The first humans likely had the</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; mutation of a straight leg: they could lock the knee and walk on two</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; legs much more easily than the chimps.  This mutation freed the hands</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; to manipulate objects.  The critical factor is that being able to</i><br>
<i>&gt; manipulate</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; objects caused the smarter protohumans to have a survival advantage</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; over dumber protohumans, whereas it is not clear to me that the smarter</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; chimps have any real reproductive advantage over dumber chimps.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Perhaps when it came to contests for females, the no-more-attractive smarter
chimps won out because those with hands free to manipulate tools could pick
up something long and heavy, and *wallop*, no more free market for
reproduction.

<p>
Don't discount violence. I think that smart people manage to control the use
of violence (again in aggregate), so that over time they get the
reproductive advantage - or else! Sex and violence go hand in hand (or boot
in balls?). There is a tendency to lump brains into the nerd stereotype, ie:
violence impared, but I think this is a little lie propagated by the smart
people. Maybe a big idiot can thump a weedy smart guy, but in the end you
usually find the lunks in the service of the nerds. The nineties, QED.

<p>
Seriously, our culture is designed for Mr Brains. In a contest between Buns
&amp; Brains, Brains must surely win out in aggregate (pumping petrol is not
attractive, even with a good haircut, perhaps unless you own the petrol
company).

<p>
Of course, as has already been stated, Mr Buns+Brains is the best of all,
but only because Buns is an added benefit over and above the prerequisite of
Brains.

<p>
In my opinion actually, social skills are far more important than either of
the above qualities (although this is after all a form of intelligence).
Also confidence. Ever wonder about those butt-ugly guys with women falling
all over them? It's not pheromones. Shyness is a good way to be celibate.

<p>
Anyone got a perspective on the female side of this debate? That is, smart
vs attractive women? Women have these problems too you know (more so maybe).
