<p>
Yes Alex!  I feel the same way, but about men!

<p>
Every relationship that I have ever had, I felt that I had to surrender an
aspect of myself, reluctantly.  Yet, I have never lost my autonomy for long
because it is far too disorienting.  Alas, most friendships also require
loosing an aspect of oneself - if only for a fleeting moment -  while
investing in the relationship.

<p>
It is a difficult balance - giving to another person and developing the
ability to empathize while also maintaining one's autonomy.  Yet, for me it
is worth it.  As in any of life's challenges, the ability to be *intimate*
and *individual* takes thought.

<p>
Best,

<p>
Natasha
