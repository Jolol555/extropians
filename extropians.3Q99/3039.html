Thank you for this explanation.  One of the things I keep forgetting 
is how much physical space you actually have for sophisticated 
security mechanisms.  Maybe it's easier to detect malicious intent?

<p>
Nanotech public relations involves emphasizing the positive and 
eliminating the negative, but realistically it seems that blue goo is 
the most practical solution.  A complex design issue: what are the 
rules that direct the robotic nanopolice that detect motives and 
modify behavior?  Will they be simple principles, or elaborate 
encyclopedias of convoluted laws?

<p>
In terms of conflict reduction, direct modification of the brains of 
the citizens seems like a logical solution to the problem.  As scary 
as it sounds, sociopathic and Hitler-like at first, it seems that it 
will be hard to resist waving the magic wand to directly remove the 
warfare from society on a neural level.  "You're still free."

<p>
Experience suggests the mass populace will not be involved in such  
decisions.  Probably it will be a military decision, with cooperation 
from a few hundred scientists who are forced to make a tough 
judgement call.

<p>
Environmentalist nanotech experts say a top priority is to "get this 
mess cleaned up."  Beyond the physical symptoms, the deeper mess is  
cultural identity that consumes and pollutes excessively.  Do you 
create an army of pollution eating nanomachines, or modify the 
culture to eliminate polluting behaviors?  Why not get to the root 
cause?  This type of education and communication will surely be on 
the unconscious level, for efficiency.  Or will a benevolent 
totalitarian government simply transfer the populace into a simulated 
safe world?
