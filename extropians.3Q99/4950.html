&lt;&lt; I realize Muse that you were making the point that not every city should 
 HAVE to be economically productive but ironically this city would be a 
 fantastic tourist attraction!!  If it were attacked it would probably be by 
 the jealous combined forces of the Disney and Universal Studios Alliance!  I 
 can just imagine air cavalry units composed of troops mounted on flying 
 Dumbo's and great white sharks!  Scary!!

Point well taken. I was thinking more in terms of a polulace with well 
developed aesthetics and highly tuned sensory nodes, rather than 
pleasure-seekers.

<p>
On another note:  I have never found the "happiest place on earth" 
particularly pleasant or aesthetically pleasing to the senses (especially the 
food - gack!!!). Disneyland with nanotech would be well ordered, immaculate &amp; 
deadly...
