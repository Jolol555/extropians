<i>&gt;  &gt;have found that 60 to 65% of the cells of the heart are actually neural</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;cells, not muscle cells as was previously believed. They are identical</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;to the neural cells in the brain, operating through the same connecting</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;links called ganglia, with the same axonal and dendritic connections that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;take place in the brain, as well as through the very same kinds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;neurotransmitters found in the brain.</i><br>

<p>
Huh? Any sources for this? The Purkinje fibers are muscle fibers that
also act as signal transductors, using gap junctions to send signals
quickly but not act as switches. The electrical of the activity is
also very simple.

<p>
<a href="0515.html#0562qlink2">&gt;  &gt;Quite literally, in other words, there is a "brain" in the heart, whose</a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;ganglia are linked to every major organ in the body, to the entire</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;muscle spindle system that uniquely enables humans to express their</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;emotions. </i><br>

<p>
Que? What is the evidence for this? As far as I remember, it is not
connected to anything by the vagus nerve and sympathetic nervous
system, and I haven't heard of any efferent connections from the
heart. 

<p>
<a href="0447.html#0562qlink3">&gt; &gt;About half of the heart's neural cells are involved in</a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;translating information sent to it from all over the body so that it can</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;keep the body</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;working as one harmonious whole. And the other half make up a very</i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt;large, unmediated neural connection with the emotional brain in our head</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0660qlink1">This sounds rather suspicious. To be honest, it sounds like</a> complete
bullshit given the effects (or rather non-effects) of pacemakers and
heart transplants on emotions.
