This is not what most people mean when they say 'monopoly'.  If
circumstances are such that someone else can open up an ooperation to
compete with yours, you aren't a monopoly in th eusual sense of the word.
More to the point, you aren't creating a problem and I therefore am not
concerned about finding a way to stop you.

Nanotechnology is not one big invention.  It is a long series of small
inventions, each of which has more than enough uses to justify its own
development cost independantly.  That being the case, there absolutely is no
need to worry about how to get it to happen - the only way I can think of to
prevent it from being invented is to blow ourselves up (and we don't
actually have the ability to do that, anyway).
