[explanation of the Uncertainty Principle]

<p>
Thanks, Ron!

<p>
That explanation reminded me of a lot of stuff I used to know :-)

<p>
It would be fair to say, I think, that getting around the HUP would be 
equivalent to finding a way to make a measurement without exchange of energy -
- something for nothing.

MentalModes.speculative = 1;

<a name="0769qlink1">A lot of scientists, most famously Einstein, have wondered what's "behind" 
QM. Common sense is somewhat affronted by, as Old Al said, "God playing 
dice." So if some more general theory were proven true such that there really 
is a nice, comfortable, somewhat understandable deterministic mechanism 
underlying QM, I suppose there *could* be a consequence of that theory that 
would make the quantum world predictable.</a>

<p>
I can't even begin to form an idea what that theory would look like; so this 
is a good warmup for the alien math thread :-)

<p>
For myself, I can handle the world being stranger than I can imagine. Lots of 
entertainment potential in the long run.
