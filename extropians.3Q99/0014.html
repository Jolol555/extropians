I gave up trying to read Gary's mind months ago.  He's a visionary
and leader, not an engineer, a crystal ball gazer, and I can't
follow him. That damn fastrac engine ain't gonna inspire anyone.

<p>
<i>&gt; I am still nursing the concept of a two stage to orbit, both</i><br>
<i>&gt; stages rotary, neither recoverable, where the second stage is</i><br>
<i>&gt; parked in a 600 km circular orbit, so that it can be used later</i><br>
<i>&gt; as raw materials to make something useful.  Ethane and lox, lox</i><br>

<i>&gt; atmospheres (absolute), the rest of the chamber operating</i><br>
<i>&gt; pressure provided by rotation.  The initial tank pressure is to</i><br>
&gt; keep the temperature of the lox below the freezing point of ethane,<br>
&gt; since my concept has the two tanks nested.<br>

<p>
<a name="0042qlink1">A coupla points- I'm sure you meant, higher pressure to keep the LOX
*above* the freezing point...</a> and propane is a better choice than
ethane (it actually has a lower gel point, and a eutectic mixture of
the two goes even lower).  Isothermal LOX/propane hjas long been a
favorite of mine.

<p>
Alas, even subcooled propane has poor density, and the pumping
pressure of a rotary engine is directly proportional to density. 
Kerosene is a *lot* easier to use.

<p>
<a name="0042qlink2">As for two rotary engines- remember that low pressure engines have
only a trivial (less than 1%) Isp hit in vacuum, with the same
expansion area ratio.  Make the upper stage pressure fed.</a>

<p>
<a name="0042qlink3">If you put back the insulation between the tanks, you can Vapack
both propellants (use their vapor pressures to drive the fluids),
eliminating helium bottles, regulators, and heaters altogether.  The
RCS runs off the vapors left after the main engine burn.</a>

<p>
The main problem is that regen cooling can't be used- the coolant
film boils in the coolant passages (think of a drop of water on a
hot skillet) giving lousy heat transfer.  The cooling would fail and
the chamber would melt.  Happily, low pressure ablators last a good
long while (at 1500+ psi, they erode frighteningly fast).  This
would make the engine, inherently an expendable, cheaper than a
regen system.

<p>
<i>&gt; I have convinced myself that the manufacturing costs of a</i><br>
&gt; system could make this concept a go, since you would have no recovery<br>
&gt; costs.  Anyone down there working on something like this?  spike<br>

<a name="0042qlink4">There are a few still grinding away... I feel this would be great
for freight, and with an escape rocket on the crew cabin, could be
used to haul people.</a>
