<a href="0052.html#0092qlink1">&gt;         Personally, I would opt to exorcise any trace of fear or anxiety.</a><br>
<i>&gt; Though I'm not naturally inclined to feel these emotions very often, I</i><br>
<i>&gt; know</i><br>
<i>&gt; that when exposed to them, it is difficult to remain rational.  </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I saw an interview with George Foreman recently, where he was talking about
<a name="0099qlink1">his heavyweight boxing career. He talked about how fear was his worst enemy
during his early years, about how when he went into the ring with the like
of Ali, his knees would shake and he'd be totally overwhelmed. He said it
was just downright frightening to be in the ring with those kinds</a> of people.

<p>
<a name="0099qlink2">Finally, one night he was about to step into the ring, and he found that he
wasn't afraid. He was cheerful, calm, confident. He got into the ring,
ready, relaxed, and had the crap beaten out of him.

<p>
He said that after that night, he spent a lot of time working to regain his
fear.
