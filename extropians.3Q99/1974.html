Isn't the libertarian approach to allow parents to do what they want and
take personal responsibility to blast them if they go too far? We already
grant parents the right to screw up their childrens lives in the most basic
way. Anyone sending their kids to school in Kansas?

<p>
If you believe people have the right to raise their own kids then we should
let them give them the best genetic start in life. When parents start doing
things that are terrible for the child I see no problem in stepping in a
removing the parent (if someone starts fucking with their kids next door I
see it as my libertarian right to go and do what I can to stop it). Of
course what is one person's blessing is another's poison: "Gee. I thought
those gills [wings, insert favourite additional appendage] would be so cool
for little Robin."
