<p>
<a href="0158.html#0162qlink1">&gt;&gt; Interestingly enough, several people suggested in the 17th and 18th century</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; that the masses of sea-shells and fossilized sea-creatures found in cliffs</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; and high places were proof that the biblical story of the flood were true,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; but the remains found were explained away by the scientists of the time as</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; having been carried up there by people, since most scientist at that time</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; where loath to admit to any evidence that would lend credence to the bible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Actually, Leonardo Da Vinci correctly deduced the origins of sea life</i><br>
<i>&gt;fossils found in the layers of the mountains, that it was once seabed</i><br>
<i>&gt;that rose up from tectonic action.</i><br>

<p>
But this wasn't generally accepted by the scientific community at large until 
much later. 
<br>
There was a lot of confusion during the dawn of the 'age of reason' in the
17th 
<br>
century due to the unfortunate tendency to dismiss things out of hand because 
they seemed to support the bible. Take meteorites for instance. Someone, I
don't remember who, once refuted an account of a meteorite fall on the
grounds that it might make people think that the stone would have fallen
from Heaven. 
<br>
Even Lavosier didn't belive in meteorites, though perhaps for other
reasons.
