Life experience, digitized, becomes marketable content.

I make a thumbs-up gesture with my dataglove, and the Poser figure 
acts it out.  Put the gesture on the web, let others download, 
receive a royalty in the form of tax-free electronic tokens.

<p>
Private commerce: from your electronic wallet to mine, in 
micropayments.  Surely, bureacrats would have my e-wallet hotwired 
into U.S. Treasury or U.S. Postal Service accounts.  So what.

<p>
My new Metacreations Poser v4.0 didn't deliver VRML export as 
promised in advertisements.  Why?  The developers are focusing their 
efforts on Metastream.

Apparently, animated figurines need to be able to conduct secure ecommerce
 transactions.  Here's a suggestion: make a VRML, or excuse 
me, X3D, version of Uncle Sam with a bag-o-coins.  He shows up on my 
screen, shouts "TRUST NO. 1" (referring to "Number One" or the Big 
One or Numero Uno as God is now called).  For my psychological pain 
and suffering related to the religious propaganda, I am awarded 
58,341.6 Riegels.  Convertable to just under $60,000 U.S.

<p>
How's the motion capture business doing now, with all the MEMS 
widgets and high speed telemetry?  It would be unfortunate if the 
library of 3D behaviors was limited to the rich and priviledged 
class.  (I can just imagine a secret lab over at Microsoft Research, 
filled with virtual actors creating whole news behavior libraries for 
the third world- to be downloaded from Teledesic.)  Not fair!!!

<p>
Nice that Defense Secretary was recently up here in the Seattle area 
to give a speech at Microsoft.  Number one defense software supplier. 
Trust Number One.
