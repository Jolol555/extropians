Went to a couple of their meetings years ago.  It seemed to be a
loose collection of those who dropped out of various churches
which believe things that are unlikely, impossible or downright
offensive.

<p>
The attendees seemed to still want that *something* that churches
provide, security, a social circle of basically nice folks, or something
deeper, which we extropians need to understand if we are ever
to appeal to a larger audience.  [Assuming we *want* to appeal
to a larger audience, which is not at all clear to me.]

<p>
Yup.  They are biiig on peace [noble thing, this].  I think Unitarians
reached their peak right after the U.S. ended its unfortunate experience
in SE Asia, and has been declining ever since.  I think they merged
with the Universalists [a group with the notion that god is nice,</a>
and therefore *all* people will be saved] but I could be mistaken.

<p>
Hope this helps.  spike
