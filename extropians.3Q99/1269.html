<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Let's not wander down _that_ road again: an unhealthy obsession with what</i><br>
<i>&gt;private groups could &amp; couldn't do helped get us in this mess in the first.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Remember TransHab?; &amp; the chaos which is sometimes laughingly referred to as</i><br>
<i>&gt;the RLV market? A significant part of NASA's problems can be pinned on the</i><br>
<i>&gt;lapel of the SFS; &amp; its scarifying influence on certain elements of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Republican Party leadership....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The immediate goal has to be to find out whether the US-American Republican</i><br>
<i>&gt;Party has deep popular support for its radical tax cut package: if so, we</i><br>
<i>&gt;have to wear the broad consequences of the policy (although the priorities</i><br>
<i>&gt;reflected by the cuts - votewinner human spaceflight as opposed to</i><br>
<i>&gt;(votelosing?) robotic missions - may still be open to debate); if not, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;strategy has to be to break the political straightjacket which has made this</i><br>
<i>&gt;decision. Obtaining reliable information on political intentions in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;nation which orchestrated spin is going to be difficult; but it needs to be</i><br>
<i>&gt;done: fast. The Republican party has clearly convinced itself that tax cuts</i><br>
<i>&gt;are the way back into power; which leaves us with the nasty possibility of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Democrats playing a game popularised by labor (&amp; other leftleaning)</i><br>
<i>&gt;parties around the world: grab the bulk of the opposition's policies, trim</i><br>
<i>&gt;the obviously ridiculous; &amp; spin the appalling mange that's left as though</i><br>
<i>&gt;it was some kind of viable alternative. To force some kind of real</i><br>
<i>&gt;alternative package through the easyout of US-American realpolitick, we hard</i><br>
<i>&gt;need evidence of support to block this budget in both the Senate &amp; the White</i><br>
<i>&gt;House... in effect, we have to convince Democrats - as well as the moderate</i><br>
<i>&gt;Republican - that _no tax cuts_ is a serious votewinner....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(Is that possible?; given the skewed democratic processes of US-America? The</i><br>
<i>&gt;last election should'ave been a serious wakeup call to the Republican party;</i><br>
<i>&gt;but the leadership is carrying on in major business-as-usual mode)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;On the question of private space exploration in particular:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The numbers are still wrong; although these are likely to improve within the</i><br>
<i>&gt;next decade. For financial reasons, the only options currently on the table</i><br>
<i>&gt;are microsats; but these have serious limitations either in available mass</i><br>
<i>&gt;or launch options: the $14m package recently offered by Jim Benson seems to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be for Earth orbiting craft only, but might carry enough of a kick to get a</i><br>
<i>&gt;cisLunar gravity assist (the thruster package hasn't be publicly stated, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;no doubt Jim B. would sell you a good kick engine if you asked for it);</i><br>
<i>&gt;while Ariane 5's ASAP-to-GTO configuration (which can certainly be used as a</i><br>
<i>&gt;launchpad for Lunar orbit... both LunARSat &amp; the CNES/NASA Mars</i><br>
<i>&gt;micromissions rely on it) limit the craft &amp; kick engine combination to</i><br>
<i>&gt;200kg, which means very limited c (if you go quick&amp;nasty with a chemical</i><br>
<i>&gt;thruster) or extraordinarily long mission times (if you try a more ambitious</i><br>
<i>&gt;mission using ion propulsion... qv the astonishing SMART-1 orbits). Don't</i><br>
<i>&gt;know if ex-Soviet ICBMs can be used for micromission launches; but i find it</i><br>
<i>&gt;difficult to believe they would be cheaper that ASAP (the same goes for</i><br>
<i>&gt;Pegasus; which has had at least interplanetary mission proposal tagged to</i><br>
<i>&gt;it... Mike Malin's SMACs proposal from the first Discovery AO). Add the</i><br>
<i>&gt;science, instruments, operations; &amp; we're talking a baseline at least equal</i><br>
<i>&gt;to SMACs' $25m a flight &amp; probably more; with limited launch &amp; research</i><br>
<i>&gt;flexibility; &amp; despite the fact that everything's been outsourced &amp; no</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology development financed.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Notwithstanding the recent interest in 1998 KY26, it's difficult to see</i><br>
<i>&gt;where commercial operations would see a cut in the information obtained from</i><br>
<i>&gt;these launches (on the technology side: NASA was unable to obtain corporate</i><br>
<i>&gt;support for Champollion); &amp; on the space research side: if there's no</i><br>
<i>&gt;government-driven space development program, the water on 1998 KY26 is</i><br>
<i>&gt;science rather than resource), although a National Geographic</i><br>
<i>&gt;Society/Discovery Channel-style media organisation _might_ be interested in</i><br>
<i>&gt;sponsorship possibilities (at least for a first flight)... money invested in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the project would therefore be money lost by the investor; so you have to</i><br>
<i>&gt;look at creating a tax deductible space research institute to collect</i><br>
<i>&gt;financing &amp; administer operations before you can launch anything. Is the</i><br>
<i>&gt;space market really that large that it can support an interplanetary</i><br>
<i>&gt;Explorers Club capable only of flying extremely simple missions at more than</i><br>
<i>&gt;$25m a pop?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;(&amp; if so: where are they now, when NASA's space science budget is being</i><br>
<i>&gt;crucified?)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;I noted with some interest that Pioneer Spaceplane's claims that its concept</i><br>
<i>&gt;could launch 500kg to Mars for $7m (probably a legacy of Zubrin's role in</i><br>
<i>&gt;developing the original concept); &amp; assume that Rotory would be looking</i><br>
<i>&gt;towards something similar... if even one cost effective RLV was currently</i><br>
<i>&gt;available, the numbers here would change dramatically; &amp; the Explorers Club</i><br>
<i>&gt;option would start look very attractive indeed (more mass in orbit with</i><br>
<i>&gt;higher c means better missions, possibly with little or no increase in</i><br>
<i>&gt;cost). I'll go further &amp; say that it's almost inevitable that such a group</i><br>
<i>&gt;will arise following a substantive reduction in launch costs; given the need</i><br>
<i>&gt;for messy, repetitive, robotic research in space &amp; the public's preference</i><br>
<i>&gt;for firsts &amp; humans; &amp; preferably first humans.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But: not now, damn it... it's too early; &amp; the numbers refuse to stack....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;All the best,</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<i>&gt;&gt; Look at what our so-called representatives in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; United States Government have done to our future in </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; space! </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; At least in principle, they are supposed to serve</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; the needs of the people - so let them know how you</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; feel about this backward leap for mankind.  Rail</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; against the dying of the light of knowledge and</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; progress, to paraphrase a poet.</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Perhaps we should take a cue from SETI when its NASA</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; project funding was cut off by the US Government in 1993:</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; Go Private.  It may not be as easy at first, but if we</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; let the ignoramuses continue to control the purse strings,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; we will have no choice in the matter, unless we want to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; see our future fade away.</i><br>
