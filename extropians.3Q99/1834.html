<a name="1981qlink1"><a name="1835qlink1">Any idea of sexuality can be reprogrammed?</a>  I'd like to consider 
myself to be bisexual, although the truth is that I'm still not 
completely comfortable with same sex sexual contact (although on a 
platonic basis, I enjoy emotion intimacy with both sexes).

<p>
I've had one experimental homosexual relationship that lasted about 2 
weeks.  It started as my being a kind of apprentice to a Reiki 
massage practitioner, who slowly desensitized me to being nude while 
receiving a massage, then eventually receiving oral sex.  It felt 
liberating to know that this was *not* high risk behavior, since I 
wasn't receiving fluids.

<p>
I've been told by other massage practitioners that this amounts to 
undue influence and breach of trust.  For me, though, it was a kind 
of therapy: a chance to know that men can exchange sensual pleasures 
in a way that respectful and safe.  I tried French kissing, but 
didn't ejoy kissing a masculine mouth nearly as much as a woman's.</a>

<p>
I do, however, consider myself to be a hedonist.  So why not conquer 
the anxiety and discomfort and learn to enjoy same sex affairs?  
There's such a large community of beautiful people who are gay or 
bisexual.  Why be limited?
