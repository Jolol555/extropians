Yes, I know.  I learned to program on a TRS-80, and my programs were rarely
more than 1K.  However, times change.

<p>
Twenty years ago it made sense to lavish extravagant efforts on a quest for
small, efficient code.  The machines of the day were so slow that if you
didn't do this, you couldn't make a usefull program.  Unfortunately, most
programmers still seem to be stuck in that era.

<p>
<a name="0458qlink1">With modern hardware you don't need to do that anymore.  Instead of devoting
50 man-years to build a hand-coded assembler program that runs in 50KB of
memory, you can spend 1 man-year to write a program that does the same thing
but needs more like 500 KB.  The idea that there is something wrong with
that approach is a serious mistake: the scarce resource today is human
effort, not memory.  The same goes for speed optimizations</a> .

<p>
<a name="0458qlink2">The smart way to write an application today is to concentrate your efforts
on good overall design, appropriate feature sets, user interface issues,
etc.  If the final result is a little slow, you can always go back and
re-write the most resource-intensive 1% of the program.  Most of the time
you won't even need to do that, because your program isn't going to put a
serious load on a modern system.  Either way, you will spend far less money
and end up with a much better (in the user's opinion) program that you would
if you obsess on efficiency issues.</a>
