<i>&gt; Sasha Chislenko thought that it would be interesting to launch</i><br>
<i>&gt; distributed computation projects for analyzing the trees</i><br>
&gt; of moves in games such as chess and checkers.<br>
&gt; How about Internet vs. Deep Blue?<br>

Such a thing is coming Sasha.  It was proposed several years
ago, but the infrastructure to do distributed computing has
developed over just the past couple years to make it practical
with Scott Kurowski and George Woltman's Mersenne Prime
Search and of course SETI@home.  I foresee within 10 yrs
most home computers will be connected to some form of
distributed computing and will stop wasting idle CPU cycles.
Then there will be an enormous disembodied computing amoeba
out there, just waiting for people to suggest problems for it
to envelop and devour, such as Eleizer's singularity problem.  spike
