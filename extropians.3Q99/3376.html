<p>
So are you saying that "whack-jobs" should be killed?  That's what it
sounds like, when you refer to a "properly armed society" and saying
that such people would be "eliminated".

<p>
There are plenty of nutty people wandering around.  It is hard to tell
which ones are seriously nutty and might someday hurt people, and which
ones are harmless loonies.  Should we kill them all, just in case?

<p>
If your neighbor arms himself with a nuclear bomb, you might say that
this is evidence that he is a crazy "whack-job".  Should we kill him?
Is that your solution to the problem - don't make it illegal to possess
excessively dangerous technologies, just kill the people who do?

<p>
Doesn't that work out to be the same as making it illegal, plus making
the penalty be death?  Why not consider an intermediate step, which is
to make possession be illegal but not to apply the death penalty?

<p>
If your "free society" comes down to one where you get the death penalty
any time you overstep somebody's ideas of normalcy, that doesn't look
very attractive.
