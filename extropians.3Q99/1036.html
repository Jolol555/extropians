<a name="1041qlink1">Wait a minute.  At the highest dosage of Fluka's product (3 ml = 83 doses =
~3 months worth) and at the Fluka price of $9.35 for 250 ml . . . that's a
little over $3.00/month compared to Somatopro's $40-$65 range.  Even better,
2.5 L at $44.25 results in a monthly cost of ~ $1.50.

<p>
Can this be right?

I also found the following statement at

be noted.

I'm responding to your question of why ASN [American Sports Nutrition]
probably doesn't want to talk about Promusol (aka 1,4-butanediol). I knew
several people who used to take this product and they all quit complaining
of severe kidney and liver pain along with respiratory problems. There have
been numerous studies done on 1,4-butanediol. The only problem is that most
of them are well hidden and hard to find and/or it is costly to order the
studies. Unfortunately, the CDC study concerning the carcinogenic
potential(lack of) for 1,4-butanediol is the only study that a lot of people
know of.

<p>
I did a lot of research on this topic a couple years back and I could
probably find the abstracts on some of the toxicity studies. To give you an
overview though, most of them found that there was no carcinogenity, genetic
mutation, and the lethal dose number was relatively high (around 10 g/kg for
mice). Unfortunately, 1,4-butanediol has been shown to cause substantial
kidney damage and some liver damage. Most of the tests indicate that 200-300
mg/kg/per day over even a couple of days of dosing would cause damage. Doses
below this were inconclusive except for one study where 2 out of 7 human
patients given 1,4-butanediol by enema at only 30 mg/kg/per day died over
the 2 week test period. The other 5 recovered with some permanent kidney
damage. Studies have been done on humans, mice, rats, guinea pigs, and
rabbits and almost every test that was done at 100 mg/kg or more per day
resulted in kidney damage and liver damage. This is probably the reason that
ASN pulled this and doesn't want to talk about it.  - anonymous

The National Toxicology Program did a study of the toxicology of 1,4
Butanediol and found that since it was rapidly converted into GHB in the
body the results would be the same as GHB -- no toxicity. From what I've
know, it is my belief that any kidney or liver problems caused by products
containing BDO are because of the impurity of the BDO used. BDO is an
industrial chemical used to make things like polyurethane bumpers for cars.
It is very hard to find high purity BDO that is safe to consume, even harder
than finding high purity butyrolactone. I have a 1,4-Butanediol product,
NeuroMod, now available to researchers. I recommend the book "GHB -- A
Natural Mood Enhancer" by Ward Dean, MD, Steve Fowkes, and John
Morganthaller.
