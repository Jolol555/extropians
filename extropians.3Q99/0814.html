  <li>  Poor Sap:  This individual is not pigeon-holed into being a poor sap
because anyone can at any time change.  A new set of cloths, a new haircut,
dancing lessons, some cologne, a sex coach, etc. could turn this type into
a new category, that is if the individual has the motivation and is not
feeling helpless.

I understand, although given motivation, one does not have to stay fixed in
any category.<a name="0816qlink1">  Self-improvement is very extropian, and if it is sex you
</a>
want,<a name="0816qlink2"> then become a visual enticement.  I might add here that most women
are far more attracted to someone who has style than a pretty face.</a>

<a href="0811.html#0814qlink3">&gt;Given your point that better nutrition, longer life, better everything,</a><br>

<p>
No, not really.  There are many pregnancies from teenagers, I believe (and
someone correct me if I am wrong).  These pregnancies are probably produced
by the Buns fellows (and I'll add that the criterion here would be youth,
not experience).<a name="0816qlink3">  Regardless, I get what you are saying and I'd add another
type which would be Mr. Caring-&amp;-Generous.  He would get the gal.
