The rest of the handwaving is pointless.

<p>
No, when the measurement is *made* by any brainless piece of
machinery (via intereaction via photons or other particles), the
wave function collapses.  This can be demonstrated by placing a
detector in a two-slit experiment, and not connecting the output to
anything.  The interference pattern goes away regardless.

<i>&gt; worlds will converge back into one universe when the electrons hit</i><br>
<i>&gt; the photographic film but their influence will still be felt,</i><br>
<i>&gt; you'll see indications that the electron went through slot A only</i><br>
<i>&gt; and indications that it went through slot B only, and that's</i><br>
<i>&gt; what causes interference. Time will tell who's correct.</i><br>

<p>
Nope- if a detector is placed on either slit, the interference
pattern goes away.  *Only* if there is no measurement made at either
slit can an interference pattern occur.  No mumbo jumbo, no
half-dead cats.
