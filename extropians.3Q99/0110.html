<a name="0125qlink1">  Here's an idea I've been kicking around, in my desire to help further the 
progress of LE techniques &amp; technologies w/o (yet!) having the ability to do 
the technical work myself:

<p>
<a name="0173qlink1">  Create a grassroots 'communication center' for current LE
researchers, future LE researchers, and other interested parties with
services/materials they wish to donate (or can provide at non-profit
rates). Each party would fill in either what they are studying, hope to 
study, or what sort of study they want to support, and the Project
would put matching parties in contact with each other--sort of like a
dating service. Everything would be done an individual-by-individual
basis--I imagine that progress will be most fertile on that level.</a>

<p>
  It would be private, non-profit, and self-funded. It would act entirely 
for the benefit of our species' greatest heroes, all current LE scientists. 
It would be designed as a resource to aid them in searching for individual 
LE funding, help find the right intern (me!), or anything else that they 
might find useful (that I am capable of doing).

<p>
  Has anything like this already been tried (or is in operation now)?

<p>
  Does anyone foresee any possible stumbling-blocks to such a project?
(I'm talking to you, current LE scientists (and potential LE benefactors)!)

<p>
  [Tentatively:] Would anyone here add such a Project to their web
site's links, or perhaps be willing to mirror its forms altogether?

<p>
  All other criticisms, comments, suggestions, etc. are *welcome*!
