<p>
We have only our own against which to judge.

<a href="1176.html#1186qlink2">&gt; There are several big mental pitfalls that you have to avoid when</a><br>
<i>&gt; approaching this subject.  Most people manage to get stuck in at least one</i><br>
<i>&gt; of them, and consequently never say anything that is even remotely</i><br>
<i>&gt; plausible.  They are, in no particular order:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Unrealistic Technology Expectations</i><br>
<i>&gt; This idea comes in two closely related forms: "Future technology will be</i><br>
<i>&gt; just like current technology" and "Future technology will be just like old</i><br>
<i>&gt; science fiction."  Wrong.  This kind of thinking leads you to ignore even</i><br>
<i>&gt; old, modest technologies like robotics and genetic engineering.  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; want a realistic picture, you need to deal with the prospects for</i><br>
<i>&gt; nanotechnology, AI, and superintelligence in a realistic manner.  If you</i><br>
<i>&gt; are going to dismiss them, you need to explicity say so (and supplying a</i><br>
<i>&gt; justification for doing so would also be a good idea).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Short Time Horizons</i><br>
<i>&gt; We aren't talking about a few hundred years of event here.  Or even a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; thousand, or a few tens of thousands.  Unless you think there is some</i><br>
<i>&gt; special reason why technological civilizations have just now become</i><br>
<i>&gt; possible, you need to deal with time spans of at least tens of millions of</i><br>
<i>&gt; years.  This is one of the reasons why most of us don't find scenarios that</i><br>
<i>&gt; include technological roadblocks or galactic Prime Directive treaties to be</i><br>
<i>&gt; very plausible.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Insufficent Appreciation of the Effects of Diversity</i><br>
<i>&gt; AKA "maybe not everyone will want to invent nanotechnology".  It doesn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; matter if 99.9999999% of all sentients spend all of eternity contemplating</i><br>
<i>&gt; their navels.  If I had the technology of 100,000 years hence, you can be</i><br>
<i>&gt; sure my personal projects would be visible from distant galaxies.  Simple</i><br>
<i>&gt; evolutionary processes will give you a universe dominated by active</i><br>
<i>&gt; explorers, even if almost everyone starts out being a homebody.  This means</i><br>
<i>&gt; that if you want to hypothesize a universe full of advanced civilizations</i><br>
<i>&gt; you need to think really, really hard about explaining why they haven't set</i><br>
<i>&gt; up shop here.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Exaggerated Respect for the Immensity of Space</i><br>
<i>&gt; The galaxy is big, but it isn't infinite.  A single expansionist species</i><br>
<i>&gt; with sublight travel could easily colonize every single system in it in</i><br>
<i>&gt; less &lt;10^6 years.  Suggesting that we are surrounded by aliens, but they</i><br>
<i>&gt; don't happen to have visited us, is equivalent to sugggesting that a</i><br>
<i>&gt; particular lot on Manhatten Island might remain vacant for the next million</i><br>
<i>&gt; years.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; Exaggerated Sense of Mortality</i><br>
<i>&gt; AKA "maybe the aliens did thus-and-such, then died off..."  What exactly do</i><br>
<i>&gt; you think could have killed them?  Most of the ideas I've heard wouldn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill of modern-day humanity, let alone spacefaring aliens.  Remember, even</i><br>
<i>&gt; without nanotechnology, a single surviving colony could repopulate an</i><br>
<i>&gt; entire species in a very short amount of time (instantly, form a geological</i><br>
<i>&gt; perspective).  If you use a realistic technology projection, and keep in</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind that some small fraction of any population is going to be prepared for</i><br>
<i>&gt; even fairly extreme emergencies, it is hard to imagine any event that could</i><br>
<i>&gt; kill of a spacefaring species.  Certainly, any disaster that big isn't</i><br>
<i>&gt; likely to leave any intact planets in the galaxy.</i><br>

<p>
If there are an infinite number of alternate realities, maybe the truly
advanced aliens have left us in this one to either observe or ignore us.

<p>
I think it is correct to consider what would be termed an actual "paradigm
shift" in the nature of intelligence and civilization considering what might be
termed as ultra-tech, as they say, to any sufficiently lower tech society
magic.

<p>
Considering those aliens that might have ascended, that might be so, or those
that attempt to do so are erased by those that already have.  This is not such
a pleasant alternative.

<p>
We might consider a wide variety of perceptual changes as technology becomes
ultimately capable.

<p>
<a name="1220qlink5">Whatever may be the case, until such time as the aliens are well</a> verified and
<a name="1220qlink6">more or less come forward for themselves or not, those that would</a> like the idea
<a name="1220qlink7">of alternate intelligences can feel good that there are millions</a> upon millions
<a name="1220qlink8">of galaxies, each with millions upon millions of stars, each</a> possibly with
<a name="1220qlink9">habitable planets per the Drake equation, that might foment</a> intelligent life as
we know it.

<p>
Interesting thoughts to consider, thank you for these.  Have a nice day,
