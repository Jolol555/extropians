Abstract
<br>
  Genetically diabetic C57BL/KsJ-db/db and normal littermate mice of both sexes
  were fed one of nine defined diets from weaning. The objective was to study
  dietary carbohydrate interaction with the
  diabetogenic genes through isocaloric substitution of protein for
  carbohydrate (either sucrose or dextrin starch) at
  concentrations of 0, 8, 24, and 60%. In addition, at 60% concentration, the
  effect of type of carbohydrate (e.g., glucose, fructose,
  sucrose or dextrin starch) on the deterioration of endocrine pancreatic
  structure and function was analyzed. The carbohydrate-free
  diet produced the greatest survival to 1 year of age and allowed the
  expression of an obesity syndrome uncomplicated by severe hyperglycemia or by
  extensive necrosis of pancreatic beta cells and islet atrophy. Those diets
  containing intermediate levels of carbohydrate (8 or 24% of
  sucrose or dextrin), or 60% dextrin starch, in comparison to diets containing
  60% refined carbohydrates, extended life span and produced a
  more protracted pathogenesis, but were unable to circumvent eventual severe
  hyperglycemia and islet destruction. The diets containing 60% glucose,
  fructose, or sucrose all led to the rapid induction of diabetes. Thus,
  pathogenesis entails an interaction between dietary
  carbohydrate, the db gene, and other diabetes-predisposing
  genes in the genome.
