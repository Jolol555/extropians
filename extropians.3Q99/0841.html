Is it just me, or does Mr. Brains eventually see how pointless
relationships are, and lose interest? A few months ago I've realized that
every relationship I've ever been in has basically required that I
surrender some of my individuality and autonomy. Even with women who call
themselves 'objectivists' 'libertarians' 'feminists' 'career-minded' or
'tom-boys'. I always have very free-form friendships, where each
individual has all the space they want, but it doesn't work the same way
with romance.</a>

<p>
Perhaps here too evolutionary psychology rears its ugly head. No matter
what a woman's ideals are, regardless of whether she happens to be in the
mood for Buns or Brains, there is this clingy little imperative inside her
screaming 'Settle down! Grab a suitable mate and stake out your
territory!'.

<p>
Mr. Celibate, ignore the peer pressure of the supposedly happy couples
holding hands in the park. They (or at least the male halves of them)
should (and maybe do) envy you.

<p>
A***o*e, you say? Oh no, that would be if I lied to myself and others,
pretending to like co-dependency.
<br>
&lt;/RANT&gt;
