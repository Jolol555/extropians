<a name="2780qlink1">The LD50 is at best a crude measure of toxicity.</a>
<a name="2780qlink2">There is also the problem of large individual differences in toxicity
between individuals. Phthalate esters cause me a lot of problems but many
individuals are not as sensitive as I am. In some individuals the P450 liver
system can handle phthalates apparently and clear them from the body. in
other individuals the phthalates are not cleared and bio accumulate to very

at the UN report on toxic exposure levels across various countries. The vary
