We're moving into an era where money can be backed by military force 
rather than gold reserves.

<p>
The U.S. Treasury just *PRINTED* an extra $200 Billion in cash in 
case there's a currency shortage due to Y2K bugs.  Why don't they use 
that currency to pay for Defense Spending and U.N. Debt?  I doubt 
there will be inflation with all the price wars going on here on the 
internet and on web-based e-commerce driven electronic storefronts.

<p>
They have the printing presses, spy satellites, cruise missiles, and 
directed energy weapons (both nonlethal and destructive).

<p>
So, if they came right out and said, "Ken's right.  We don't need 
your money- keep it." there would be outcries of coup d'état from the 
veterans and nontechnologists.  It seems like the people in power 
(behind the scenes) are actually quite libertarian and decentralists, 
enthusiastic about completely private e-commerce.  But when it comes 
to publicly acknowledging the end of federal taxation: they evade the 
issue and return to emotions of national pride and loyalty.

<p>
It seems like the only way to really get this done is large scale 
civil disobedience in a nonchalant manner, with an attitude that the 
system is in a transition state, and we're still civil and orderly.

<p>
For example, use a large international body with no formal government 
ties (<a href="http://www.worldbank.org/">http://www.worldbank.org/</a>) create all the electronic 
infrastructure needed for international e-commerce that's completely 
outside of government juristiction.  It would be a pro-social proenvironmental
 (cashless) economy.

<p>
I'm a layperson, obviously simple-minded on this matter.  But tacit 
acknowledgement of common sense economic and civil liberties seems to 
be the most sensible migration path out of this bureacratic hell of 
complexity piled on top of complexity.

<p>
Incidentally, what if the Defense Department (or NATO, or ex-Warsaw 
Pact) Technologists had all the resources in place to track every 
living human on the planet simultaneously.  Instead of carrying a 
walet, the citizens x,y,z coordinates could become their account i.d. 
 The wealth would never leave the person, so to speak.  What do you 
think?
