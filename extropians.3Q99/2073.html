There structure of a sphere, where every "node" on the sphere has a
line-of-sight direct communication path to every other node on the sphere
is a logical implementation for optimal communications when you are using
photons as your carrier wave.  The two problems that I had with it were:
  (a) I couldn't figure out a configuration for &gt; 10^19 transmitters
<pre>
      and receivers at *each* node.  Since I think we are material
      constrained anyway, having that many transmitters &amp; receivers
      at each node seemed to only make things worse.  This is particularly
      true when the materials required are things like Galium, Arsenic and
      Indium that aren't very abundant.  I punted and went with a hexagonal
      configuration where each node only communicates with its nearest
      neighbor.  All nodes act as routers to other nodes in the net so
      all messages get delivered sooner or later.
  (b) It wasn't clear to me what happens when you have photons from
<a name="2128qlink1">      10^19 to 10^38 beams crossing each other at the center of a sphere.
      I'm pretty sure that you have problems due to EMF interactions
      but I'm not sure at what density level the photons really start
      to interfere with each other.  At some energy density, I presume
      we turn energy into matter, yes?</a>  The receivers aren't going to work
      for long if they are designed to receive photons and protons arrive
      instead.  [Comments from the hard core physicists are welcome.]

<p>
You presumably could fill the sphere with fiber and prevent interactions
between the beams but you are likely to run into a materials shortage again.

<p>
If it turns out that you want to optimize communications over either
computation or memory, I would agree that J-Brains/Zeus structures may
be the way to do this and that they are likely to be small due to materials
limitations.

<p>
As you point out, there are likely to be cooling problems.  You could
spin a sphere, or you could simply "flow" the heat through the structure.
