Nice example. To those who are confused and are inevitably going to
ask for an explanation (I peeked into the future), try thinking
about the path in time and space of the photons being spewed out
from the laser. Think of them as rubber bullets that bounce off the
inner surface of the sphere and into your eye.

<p>
I agree that phase speed (which is unobservable directly) can
"travel" at &gt;c, but I don't see what that has to do with the example.
But it doesn't matter.

Don't worry, it's worse; there are universes in which John is using
an Amiga.

<p>
That is to say, in the many-worlds interpretation, the idea of time
travel is non-paradoxical, since you really travel to an alternate
universe what is similiar in most, but not all, aspects from the
one you came from, and don't cause any paradoxes.

<p>
See _The Fabric of Reality_. David Deustch. the chapter "Time, the
first quantum concept". He explains it better than I can.
Or his Scientific American article. (I don't remember "when".)

[fyi, Gateway bought the rights to whatever is left of the Amiga
technology...]
