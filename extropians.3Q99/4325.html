The vacuum sphere approach likely doesn't work, but it reminded me of
Vinge's bobbles. He mentions in _The Ungoverned_ that projecting a
stasis bubble around a tornado was a good way of dealing with them; it
would likely work for hurricanes too. Too bad bobbles are just sf (and
there isn't much in physics that suggests that they are possible in
any form, unlike "real" stuff like wormholes and beanstalks).

This is likely the way to do it. Much neater. Although I had this nice
idea of seeding the caribbean with nanotech weathervanes, that start
pumping up cold water as soon as the windspeed picks up, neatly
self-regulating things :-)

<p>

<i>&gt; reduced.  That would produce a drastic climate change in Western Europe,</i><br>
<i>&gt; especially in Britain and Ireland.  The EU would complain to the UN, and</i><br>
<i>&gt; if they did not obtain satisfaction the French would send saboteurs to</i><br>
<i>&gt; disable the pumps.</i><br>

Why not make a deal? We move down to the carribeans, europan climate
isn't that great anyway.  (said by a Swede awaiting the long autumn
and winter months :-)
