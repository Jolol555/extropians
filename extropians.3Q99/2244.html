<a href="2224.html#2244qlink1">&gt;What is "the law of comparative advantage?" or where</a><br>
<i>&gt;can I find out more about it?  </i><br>

<p>
The law of comparative advantage shows why the international division of 
labour is beneficial to all. It states that every country can improve 
its welfare by specialising in the most efficient lines of production 
open to them, those in which they have a comparative advantage. The most 
efficient lines of production are those in which a country's 
productivity relative to others is greatest. This is commonly 
misunderstood to mean those lines of production in which a country is 
more efficient than all others. If this were true then some countries 
could conceivably have a comparative advantage in nothing, whereas, in 
reality every country has a comparative advantage in something, as they 
must be more efficient in some lines of production than others. For 
example a very inefficient country in a two-country two-commodity 
universe may be half as productive as the other country in producing one 
commodity and only a quarter as productive in the other. Its comparative 
advantage would lie in producing the commodity in which it had half the 
productivity of the other country. The law of comparative advantage 
means that even a country least efficient at producing everything will 
benefit from free trade. This is because it allows the inefficient 
country to specialise in what it is relatively poor at producing rather 
than in what it is *very* poor at producing.
