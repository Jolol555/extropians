<a name="2993qlink1"><a name="2990qlink1">Not to be a 'list mom', but this thread is becoming increasingly fragmented
and has some unrelated discussion.</a>  Because I would like to see something
actually come of this, I would like to list out the 'dangers' mentioned
thus far:</a>


<OL>
<a name="2993qlink2">  <li>  Transhumanism is entering the puhlic sphere, and Waldemar proposes that
the 'nanotech santas' will have to start backing up their claims with real
facts and science.</a>

  <li>  Transhumanism is entering the public sphere, and many of us agree that
we will have to become more proficient in handling media coverage.  At the
same time, that increased media coverage may result in more attacks on our
ideas and on our image.

  <li>  There seems to be some sort of issue regarding 'right' and 'left', one
that the Europeans seem to understand, but one that mystifies the
Americans.  Perhaps the real danger here is in transferring external
political divisions into transhumanism, and thereby perpetuating outdated
modes of debate.  

  <li>  There seems to be many issues under the rubric of
centralism/decentralism:  Lack of delegation in group activities.  A
tendency to label people as gurus or geniuses.  

<a name="2990qlink2">  <li>  Demographics-- a present lack of diversity within transhumanism</a> that
could easily be used by the media and by opponents of our ideas as a means
of attack.  Diversity in this case can mean racial, gender, and also
intellectual.  A lack of diversity also means a lack of contribution from a
wide range of perspectives and experiences, which could lead to narrow
visions of the future and how to plan for it.  The challenge:  how to reach
out to others and bring them into our networks.
