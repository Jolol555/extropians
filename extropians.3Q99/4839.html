<a href="4834.html#4839qlink1">&gt; What is currently the densest language (i.e. the fewest</a><br>
<i>&gt; lines on the part of the programmer, result in the greatest</i><br>
<i>&gt; amount of work on the part of the machine?)  SQL?</i><br>

<p>
Ah ha, Kolmogorov complexity! There's a theorem that states that the
amount of code it takes to express an algorithm only varies by a
constant across description systems, and the upper bound on that
constant is amount of code it takes to simulate system A in system B.

<p>
Beware of language debates - there isn't a best one. There are some
problems where I wouldn't use anything but C, and some that, if I had
to do it in C, step one would be writing a Lisp system.

<p>
Beware of new languages - no amount of design and forethought is
equivalent to years of real world use. Beware too of productivity
studies, for language vendors are subtle and quick to fabricate.

<p>
Beware of dense languages - Perl may be fun to write, but have you
ever tried to debug someone else's line noise?
