<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;I agree on both points.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0152qlink1">Yes, but why your shoelaces becomes untied isn't really a mystery. No one
(I hope!)
<br>
feels the need to invoke nanotech as an explanation. 

<p>
(Hey! Waitaminit! Maybe it's a plot by the army to disable the soldiers of
opposing armies by causing their shoelaces to become untied in combat using
nanotech!) 

<p>
Besides, even if I am personally unable to write a paper explaining why the
laces
<br>
on my sneakers often becomes untied while the laces on my other shoes
don't, it's  
<br>
still not something that I would spend time studying.</a> On the other hand, we
have 
<br>
<a name="0152qlink2">thousands of people, some of them even 'qualified', claiming to see
unidentified things in the sky and on the ground.</a> Some people even claim
<a name="0152qlink3">that these objects have been registered on radar screens and photograpic
film.<a name="0147qlink1"> It seems to me that there is a mystery that deserves</a> to be
</a>
<a name="0152qlink4">investigated here, for if all these people are lying or are mistaken about
natural phenomena, yet consistently repeats the same hallucinatory details,
then that is surely something that needs to be investigated</a> by psychologists. 
<a name="0152qlink5">(Rather few psychologist since Jung have done any study</a> of the UFO phenomena.)
<a name="0152qlink6">Then it requires the same amount of study as say, glossalia or some other
minor psychological abberation. If they are not lying or mistaken, then the
mystery of what they really saw awaits.</a>        

<p>
<a href="0142.html#0145qlink2">&gt;&gt;&gt;But what I read on the subject sometimes strikes me as descriptions of</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;extropian technologies.  Witnesses describe the aliens' uncanny ability to</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;levitate and walk through walls: sounds like utility fog to me.  And I</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;remember a description of a levitation "ray" used by an apparent craft</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;that ooked "grainy": possible refraction caused by the presence of copious</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;nanomachines?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;This is a definite possibillity, and unfortunatly, as far as I'm aware, not</i><br>

<p>
<a name="0152qlink7"><a href="0142.html#0145qlink3">&gt;&gt;one that have been mentioned in any book on the subject. (UFO's, that is,</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;not nanotech.)</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;But the same can be said about any paranormal phenomena or even stuff</a> we are</i><br>
<a name="0152qlink8"><i>&gt;pretty sure is outright bull.  I mean, perhaps Jesus was resurrected using</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotech.  Perhaps the dinosaurs became extinct because of nanotech.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Perhaps the apparitions of the Virgin seen in so many places is actually</i><br>
<i>&gt;nanotech in action.  This really doesn't clear things up.</i><br>

<p>
Of course, you are right, but remember that nobody said it would. 
This is only speculation, after all.</a> 

<p>
<a href="0142.html#0145qlink4">&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe the so-called alien presence is some form of projection showing us</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;what's ahead on our technological horizon; remember that the UFO</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;phenomenon,</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;in its earliest modern form, took the appearance of "ghost rockets" over</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Scandinavia during a period when rocket research was in its infancy.  Anddo</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;I even need to mention the phantom airships of the late 1800s?</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;Maybe this is a form of quantum mentation in action.  (Or maybe it's</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;&gt;really aliens--transtemporal, ET or otherwise.  But that's not the focus</i><br>
of this
<br>
<a href="0142.html#0145qlink5">&gt;&gt;&gt;post.)</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;*whimsical speculation mode on*</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;One 'transhuman possibillity', put forward by John Keel and others, are</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;that we are being not-so-subtly tested/influenced by a Power. Perhaps the</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;Singularity has already occured and we're the descendants of the neophobes</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;who refused to take part.....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a name="0152qlink9"><i>&gt;It's also the plot for some science fiction novels, such as Ian Watson's</i><br>
<i>&gt;_Miracle Visitors_...  It makes for interesting science fiction, but</a> I don't</i><br>
<a name="0152qlink10"><i>&gt;think it's so.  But if it is, Have pity on me Oh Great Ones!  Take me into</i><br>
<i>&gt;your paradisical future!:)</i><br>

<p>
Be careful, they are probably monitoring our transmissions....:)</a>

<p>
<a name="0152qlink11"><a href="0142.html#0145qlink6">&gt;But in truth, I think people experience lots of things that have more</a><br>
<i>&gt;mundane explanations BUT would be much more interesting if cloaked in</i><br>
<i>&gt;mystery. </i><br>
 
<p>
Certainly true. As a wise man once said; humans live thru their myths and
only endure their realities.</a>

<p>
<a name="0152qlink12"><a href="0142.html#0145qlink7">&gt;Each age and culture has its own way of dealing with this.  If the</a><br>
<i>&gt;"ghost rockets" (and this is the first I've heard of them) had been</a> seen 30</i><br>
<a name="0152qlink13"><i>&gt;years earlier, they might have been called "phanton airships" or 300 years</i><br>
<i>&gt;earlier "witches" or 3000 years earlier....  </i><br>

<p>
Yes, that's part of the theory. The Power would mask itself as something 
that could be comprehended by the cultures it was observing/</a>experimenting on.
<a name="0152qlink14">5000-2000 years ago flying chariots, flying shields and what have you,
phantom dirigibles a hundred years ago, phantom rockets and phantom
aviators eighty to 
<br>
sixty years ago and now phantom space craft manned by aliens.</a>   

<p>
<a name="0152qlink15"><i>&gt;Well, you get the point.</i><br>
<a href="0142.html#0145qlink8">&gt;That's a lot of testing.  That power must be very inefficient</a> or sloppy or,</a><br>

<p>
<a name="0152qlink16"><a href="0142.html#0145qlink9">&gt;hard to believe, stupid.</a><br>

<p>
That depends on what timescale the tests would be made on, and what kind of
tests.
<br>
After all, what's the use of being immortal if you can't do research
projects lasting for
<br>
very great lenghts of time? That would be one of the natural advantages of
being a Power, methinks. 
<br>
And besides, the rationale and methods of a true Power would probably be
incomprehensible to us. That could be used against my argument as well, of
</a>course.     

<p>
<a name="0152qlink17"><a href="0142.html#0145qlink10">&gt;I do find these things interesting and the speculations are also so, but I</a><br>
<i>&gt;have a feeling all this cool tech won't come about until we make it come</i><br>
<i>&gt;about.</i><br>

<p>
Possibly. As I said, this is all speculation. Or maybe not.</a>
