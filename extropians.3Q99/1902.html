That's pretty surprising.  It sounds even more extreme than the creation
science people who want their theories to be taught alongside evolution.
The Kansas school board is saying that evolution can't be taught at all
in the context of the formation of new species.

<p>
My guess is that they will be forced to reverse their decision.  It sounds
like the groundswell of opposition is just beginning.  The board took
this step without much public visibility.  Now they will find out what
the public really believes.
