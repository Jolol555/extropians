News report from the GNS, the Galactic News Service

<p>
[Theme music - intro]


<UL>
  <li>  The Promised Land soon to be revealed **


</UL>
<p>
The Planet Canaan - a promised land of luxury and enlightenment. Whispers of
its mysteries have teased and intrigued GalacticCitz for centuries. Remnants
of lost civilisations, exquisite hidden knowledge of times past, as well as
the most exotic sensory experiences in the known universe. All hidden behind
the opacity of a planet closed to the outside world for more than four
hundred years. But that is about to change...

<p>
The Planet Canaan has recently decided to drop its barriers to the
GalacticCiv. Rumors abounded that the people of the planet had cloistered
themselves to work on some almighty, planet wide project, perhaps the
greatest cultural artifact ever produced in the history of the GalacticCiv.
It has now been confirmed that these people have produced a great work, and
are readying to share it with us all. Details of the nature of the work are
still shrouded in secrecy, however.

<p>
What is known is that these intensely cerebral people warmly welcome
visitors, and the very few who have visited their planet during their
cloistered period have come away strongly affected by the experience. 

<p>
Currently they are building their first spaceport; the expected date of
completion is one galactic month, official opening following soon after
(rumors are that the Galactic President herself will be doing the honours!)

<p>
The educated elite of our galaxy wait, breathless, on this monumentous
planetary opening and revelation of the treasures contained within. It is
almost certain to be an historical, cultural watershed for the GalacticCiv.
GNS, your news service, is holding this planet under the closest scrutiny.
We will inform you of new developments FIRST, as they occur.
