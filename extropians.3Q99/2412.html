<i>&gt; mars's gravity is too weak.  (surface gravety = .4*earth surface gravity)</i><br>

<p>
Even if it would float away, the rate would be quite slow by human
measures - calculations in rec.arts.sf.science suggest that even the
moon could sustain a breathable atmosphere for 10,000 years. Mars
would definitely have a much longer time constant, and I'm not even
sure the equilibrium is near vacuum.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2412qlink2">&gt; 2.  It would be cheaper to "teraform" the Aulstralian desert or</a><br>
<i>&gt; build taller buildings.</i><br>

<p>
Why are you terraforming? If you want living space, go for
self-sufficient space colonies based on asteroid resources. If you
want to make the grandest possible garden, then Australia might be a
starting point (but the environmental changes brought about by the
terraforming of australia might upset other people) but a planet would
be even greater.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2412qlink3">&gt; 3.  Space flight takes too long.  Asuming you acellarate at 1 g, it would take at least </a><br>
<i>&gt; 6 months to reach mars.  </i><br>

<p>
No, this is wrong. No doubt our spaceflight experts have the exact
time for a standard orbit, but it is on the order of around a year -
with no constant acceleration. If you could make a 1g constant thrust
drive, then I could be there within a few days at most. Unfortunately
there is no such drive on the horizon yet.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2412qlink4">&gt; 4.  There is no infastructure, and no one to live with.</a><br>

<p>
So? Terraforming is a group effort, and while you are setting things
up you will by necessity have to set up an infrastructure. And after
Mars have become livable (by whatever definitions people use - some
might like the intermediate stages better than the finished ones)
people will want to live there.
 
<p>
<a href="2408.html#2412qlink5">&gt; 5.  Everyone benifits from teraforming, no matter who pays.</a><br>

<p>
So you think nobody would undertake the project due to free riders?
Altruists might want to do it anyway, especially if it is a cheap
project at a given (high) level of technology. And I guess the
libertarian answer would be to privatize the planet and sell off real
estate.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2412qlink6">&gt; 6.  No one on earth will allow the transfer of oxygen.</a><br>

<p>
Huh? No terraforming proposals have involved bringing oxygen from the
Earth - that would be downright inefficient. Bring in water from the
outer solar system, and use plants and/or nanotech to produce oxygen
locally.

<p>
<a href="2408.html#2412qlink7">&gt; 7.  A teraformed planet may require matenance.  </a><br>

<p>
So? You already have the technology in place. 
 
<p>
<a href="2408.html#2412qlink8">&gt; 8.  It is too big of a project for any corporation or nation to pay for it.</a><br>

<p>
This assumes current technology and economics - today it isn't even
physically feasible to terraform. But costs seem to decrease compared
to wage buying power at a roughly exponential rate, meaning that a
project that today is too expensive and infeasible might be quite
cheap and practical a few centuries hence. Just look at the stuff
ordinary people do today for fun that would in the past have required
the wealth of a king.
