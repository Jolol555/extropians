By the way-like your website, G.B.  I tend to be a nano/extro pessimist. I 
believe eveything that has been proposed by TransHumanists &amp; Extropians is 
logically possible. I do suspect (rightly or wrongly) that the futures 
envisoned in literature by the Bears/Egans/Sterling/Gibson and company are 
quite likely to occur. I suspect also, that where most of you say decades; I 
say centuries (milenia) for the really big changes to happen-such as the 
Singularity.  For those such as I, we focus either on whats close by 
technically; or cast our immaginations into the deep futures that may occur 
with cosmology. Perhaps to universe governed by intelligence instead of 
randomness.
