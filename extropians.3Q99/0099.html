This reminds me of a conversation I had when I was in law school.  One of my 
professors was a noted authority on constitutional and federal procedural law 
who, but for a particularly stupid burglary in a Washington D.C. office 
building, might today be Chief Justice.  Like everyone else who studied under 
him, I was in awe, not least of which because he has argued so many important 
cases in the Supreme Court.  I asked him when he stopped being anxious about 
the pressure of standing up and arguing a case in court.  He responded, 
"Never.  I still get nervous every single time I walk into a courtroom."  He 
explained that only a stupid lawyer doesn't have this feeling.  He then more 
than earned his tuition by offering me some practical tips for channeling and 
overcoming that feeling.

<a name="0159qlink3">Almost all emotions serve vital functions in mental life.  They serve as 
motors and gauges.  I think transhumanists should aim to refine our emotions, 
but not to do away with them.  (I also think that the idea of a truly 
sentient AI without emotions is like imagining an automobile without a motor 
</a>or instruments.)
