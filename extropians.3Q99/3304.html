<p>
I know why -- because I don't want to drown. :-)
But, the point about the "philosophical undergirding of transhumansim"
strikes home.  We are faced with a fundamental problem of constructing
a philosophy for a system which we are woefully ill-equipped to
comprehend.

<p>
<a name="3310qlink1">Humans have been selected to be about two things: survival &amp; reproduction.
</a>
</a>
Now, all of the technophile discussions, AI discussions, political
discussions, etc. seem to some degree to revolve around --
"how can *I* survive?", and as a subtheme --
"and how can *I* live in an environment that is just the way *I* like it?".
Sometimes this gets extended to inviting/dragging other people along
into your perfect environment or encouraging them to create their own.

<p>
Now, leaving aside the technical details of whether it is really
feasible, let us *assume* that survival is guaranteed.  It does seem
like that is a distinct possibility (ignoring the probabilities).
So lets say we are surviving in whatever enhanced form and perfect
environment we have choosen.

<p>
<a name="3312qlink1">How does a species that to a large degree based on a fight for
survival, develop a philosophy, or a rasion-d'etre, for this
environment.  Yes, we have all seen the posts -- I want to travel,
I want to create music/art/explore interesting scientific problems,
etc.  I raised a point a week or so back, that perhaps the purpose
of it all was to turn all of the available matter &amp; energy in
the universe into a "perfect" structure or the "ultimate" thought
machine, or maybe the single most aesthetic work of art.  I don't
recall anyone commenting on that, but I think it begins to chip
at the problem.

<p>
When it is *not* about survival (or reproduction) -- What is it about?
</a>
Is it possible for non-transhumans to discuss transhumanist philosophy?

<p>
A related background information piece would be for someone who
has a significant understanding of philosopy to outline all of
the known philosophies (and religions?) and divide them into some
categories -- not/concerned with survival, not/concerned with
purpose for existance, not/concerned with happiness, etc.

<p>
We could use this to see how existing philosophies [religions?]
stack up and determine which have to be thrown out entirely
in a transhumanist[technology at the limits of physics] environment.

<p>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a href="3273.html#3304qlink2">&gt; Seems important to think about these things. Is anyone here worried</a><br>
<i>&gt; about slipping into a psychosis of nihilism once their IQs are high</i><br>
<i>&gt; enough that they realize that their goals have no philosophical</i><br>
<i>&gt; foundation (or *might* have no foundation)?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>

<p>
I would argue that the condition of nihilism [rejection of traditional
perspectives (esp. morality &amp; religion)] must exist in an advanced
SI(perhaps even AI) because the traditional perspectives are fundamentally
based on surivival &amp; reproduction requirements (which are largely irrelevant
to them).  But I think psychosis (as a detachment from reality)
would not exist, unless intentionally created, because they are
capable of observing reality much more clearly than we are.

<p>
But so far the discussion about what SIs/AIs *do* has only seemed
to generate the result of (a) compute a safe path of existence;
(b) put yourself on that path; (c) suspend all thought until something
that represents an unanticipated threat or is simply novel occur.

<p>
Now, if the other possibility that seems to fit the available data
is -- become an SI/AI, think about a philosopy for existence,
realize that there is no philosopy (because survival *was*
the purpose for existence and once survival is guaranteed,
existence is pointless); dismantle yourself back into atoms.
This seems to fit the paradox of "Why do we still see stars?".

<p>
<a href="3273.html#3304qlink3">&gt; If this is an old topic, perhaps someone could point me to a place where</a><br>
<i>&gt; it has already been discussed.</i><br>

<p>
I haven't seen it yet, but there are minds with deeper
memory banks than mine lurking in the shadows.
