I am afraid that I agree.  But there is something you are missing.  The traits
that you are complaining about are not quite as wide spread as you make them out
to be, but what makes them so pernicious is that these are the traits of the
female ruling click.

<p>
You see, controlling types tend to have a disproportionate influence, because
they tend to band together and punish anyone who does not behave in the
prescribed manner.  And if you think these kind of women have done a number on
your male friends, you should see what they do to other females who dare to read
science fiction, or are good at math!!!  I am a sensitive, intelligent woman.  I
am truly interested in people, instead of just being interested in what people
can do for me.  And the callous treatment that I have received from other woman
is amazing.  Other woman will talk about how 'caring' they are, while the work
hard and long to convince me that there is something wrong with me.  I now know
that they are the enemy, but I have been so hurt, for so long, that my poor
vagina spasms uncontrollably.

<p>
And women's lib has given these controlling types even more power.  They have
been able to take over influential professions, such as the education of young
children. Some women should be put in there place, and I would love to help do
it.
