<a name="3550qlink1"><a name="3543qlink1">Ja.  Cameron, Deep Blue changed the way we think about the task of
playing chess.  Im suggesting that *everything* we do can be calculated
brute force style, even if we dont fully understand how our minds do it.
This is a strong statement: that given sufficient computing power, computers
can enjoy, can feel, can love, etc, as soon as we develop the algorithms.
Chess is not a unique example, nor speech recognition.  This is profound
as all hell, Cam, since the faster computers are coming, like a speeding
train.  No stopping</a> it.

Perhaps extropians can help:  How do we *know* we are not *currently*
uploaded simulations, running on some unimaginably advanced supercomputer?
Is there any way to know?  spike
