<a name="3431qlink1">Okay.  First of all, that's not right.  There's a number of modules
containing domain-specific *codelets* - not knowledge - and the
"domains" are things like "causality" or "similarity" or "reflexivity",
not things like "knowledge about the French Revolution" or "knowledge
about cars".  Furthermore, the world-model is not centralized.  There is
nothing you can point to and call a "world-model".  The world-model is a
way of viewing the sum of the interrelated contents of all domdules.

<p>
Precisely.  That is, in a nutshell, the entire problem of seed AI. 
"Write a program that can represent, notice, understand and improve on
its local component code and global design paradigms in an open-ended way."

<a name="3431qlink2"><a name="3410qlink1">In my mind, I conceptualize "AI" and "transhuman AI" as being two
entirely different fields.  AI is stuck in the cardboard box of
insisting on generalized processing, simplified models, and implementing
only a piece of one problem at a time instead of entire cognitive
architectures; they're stuck on systems that a small team of researchers
can implement in a year.

<p>
<a name="3431qlink3">I like to think that I actually appreciate the humongous complexity of
the human mind - in terms of "lines" of neurocode, not content, but code
- and that I've acknowledged the difficulty of the problem of creating a
complete cognitive architecture.  I suffer from absolutely no delusion
that a transhuman AI will be small.  In the end, I think the difference
is that I've faced up to the problem.
