<p>
Yes, it is.  However, the basic question of the original post (IMHO) was 
"When should parents be allowed to make this decision, and when should they 
be prevented from doing so?"  Since the only effective means of preventing 
parents from making their own decisions is government action, I think my 
response is perfectly reasonable.  But perhaps I should back up a few 
steps.

<p>
Any discussion of this issue needs to be guided by two important 
realizations:


<OL>
  <li>  We are not going to achieve a broad consensus issue anytime soon.  The 
ideas held by different groups of people about what constitutes treatment 
vs enhancement, benificial changes vs harmfull ones, and the proper scope 
of parental vs social responsibility, are simply too diverse.  The 
diversity of opinion will only grow as the issue moves into the mainstream 
over the coming years.

  <li>  These issue are sufficiently important that only the most extreme social 
pressures would deter individuals from acting according to their own 
conscience.  Since broad consensus is very unlikely, there will be no 
strong social pressures - just a complex, many-sided debate.

  <li>  These issues are sufficiently complex that any hard-and-fast rule about 
what actions are permissible is likely to displease everyone involved. 
 They are also sufficiently important that anyone who has the authority to 
make rules is likely to feel a moral obligation to do so.  That means that 
this is an extremely slippery slope - it will be very difficult to set up 
any kind of regulation at all without ending up with an Office of 
Reproductive Regulation that produces endless reams of complex law.


</OL>
<p>
With these limitations in mind, I see only two options about the location 
of decision-making authority that can be expected to be at all stable. 
 These are:


<OL>
  <li>  Give the government complete control over all decisions.  They get to 
decide what modifications will and will not be allowed, what circumstances 
they will be allowed under, and who will have access to them.

  <li>  Give parents broad discretion to make their own ethical decisions. 
 Forbid only those modifications that would run afoul of existing laws 
regarding slavery, murder, bodily injury, etc.


</OL>
<p>
Do you see another option?
