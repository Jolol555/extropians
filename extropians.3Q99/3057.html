<a name="3069qlink1">Greg, this looks true, but there are a couple things I dont understand.</a>
The experimenters that switched the chimp heads commented that
heads are in fact one of the easier organs to transplant, because
everything is out in the open.

<p>
<a name="3069qlink2">They say it costs £800,000.   Why should it be so costly?
I know there are buttloads of muscles in the neck, but if they
are going to be useless anyway, why connect them?  Looks
like the surgeons need to only sew together the major blood
vessels.</a>

<p>
The other thing they said was that this technique had been
proven on mammals in the early 1990s, but I saw what looked
like a reliable website describing the chimp experiments that took
place back in the 1960s.  Perhaps the newspaper messed it up?

<p>
This could be critical as hell, since if it works, it would be the
most promising path to cryonics for people with emphasema
or other disease.  spike

<i>&gt; A LEADING brain surgeon has unveiled plans to perform the first human head</i><br>
<i>&gt; transplant. The operation, already carried out successfully on dogs and</i><br>
<i>&gt; monkeys, would initially cost £800,000....</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; The technique for transplanting heads was proven in principle with small</i><br>
<i>&gt; mammals in the early 1990s. However, it was abandoned when scientists</i><br>
<i>&gt; realised that the extra time needed to reconnect larger human arteries and</i><br>
<i>&gt; muscles would deprive the brain of oxygen and cause tissue damage....</i><br>
