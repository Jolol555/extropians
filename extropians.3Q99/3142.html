<OL>
  <li>  In any way does cryonics provide the same sort of psychological
comfort that religion provides for some people?  Have you just replaced 
heaven with the future?


</OL>
<p>
<a name="3181qlink2">The future is largley unlinked to heaven in a scientific world. The concept 
is immortality, or at least a largely expanded life.
<p>
    The truth is, the future will be more like hell if some things happen. We 
will wake up completely unprepared for the onslaught of technology. We may 
well go insane.</a>

<p>
<a name="3181qlink3"><a name="3167qlink3"><a name="3163qlink2">2.  Since you plan to live forever, what are your long term goals?</a></a></a>

<p>
<a name="3181qlink4">Long term goals? See the universe. Bask in the glow of a foreign star. Have 
dinner wive my descendents and tell them of the barbaric 20th century when 
compared the the 44th century or whatever.</a>

<p>
<a name="3163qlink3"><a name="3152qlink1">How do you look at life differently than somebody who expects to live a 
<a name="3167qlink4">short life span?</a></a></a>

<p>
Everything that is done can have serious ramifications. Take the butterfly 
theory. True thats more Chaos theory then extropy.

<p>
<a name="3163qlink4"><a name="3152qlink2">2.  Are any of you afraid of your bodies falling into the wrong hands
<a name="3167qlink5">after your frozen?  It is possible that you might be reanimated</a> as some kind 
of lab animal.
</a>

<p>
Many people think the world will revel in the oldest person alive. I dont. If 
</a>
I wake up as a lab animal, then I will kill myself, in the event I dont like 
the pellets.
