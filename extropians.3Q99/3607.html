Never.

I can probably count on two hands the number of times in the last 25
years I've eaten meat (steak I could probably do on one hand),
so I don't think this is much of a problem.  And besides, I have

But I think we may get back into the "too much information" problem.
Are you qualified to judge whether U.S.D.A meat inspectors are
better or worse than Elmer &amp; Mo's Clean Meat Verification Services, Inc.?
What about comparing in detail two legal systems such as the U.S.
system and the French system?
