<a href="3220.html#3243qlink1">&gt;This is a very good point and one that I think has been missed in &gt;some of these discussions. There is a tremendous tension between &gt;individual freedom and the common good. This has always been true, &gt;and the Western political tradition has in large part been a search &gt;for a principled line between the two. </a><br>

<p>
In the current American socio-political landscape, most of our current public debates have a basis in exactly this tension:  abortion, gun control, smoking, even cloning and genetics. 

<p>
<a name="3555qlink1">Turning to the applications of that tension within extropianism, itself, I arrive at the following 'hard questions':  To what extent do extropians support the development of a wider community, and to what extent would they prefer to develop private enclaves?  Will extropians arrive at a point wherein they reject the sovreignty of any nationally-based governance, or would the extropians in the end have to establish a compromise</a> between their own ideals and the strictures of geopraphically-based polity?  If extropians decide to establish their own polity, what form would it take?
