d) Less frequent, less sever punishment; e) More children from broken homes; f)
Increases in the size of groups that are prone to violence problems; g) Gun
control laws that have the effect of making criminal activity less hazardous.

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt; I'm not sure we can make this point.  If you look at Japanese culture</i><br>
<i>&gt; there is a history of violence between the Shoguns.  They ruled Japan</i><br>
<i>&gt; from 1192 to 1867, a *very* long period.  If during this period,</i><br>
<i>&gt; warriors were valued, then there would be little "weeding-out".</i><br>

<p>
This valued group formed their own breeding caste, and the type of violence they
practiced is a new type of violence.  It is organized, disciplined violence.
Where warriors are expected to be so obedient that they would commit suicide on
command.

<p>
So the working caste would be composed of harmless sheep, while the warrior
caste would be composed of sheep with fangs.  But they would still be sheep,
none the less.
