Actually, take the case a few years ago of the teacher in Seattle who
got pregnant by one of her 14 year old students... she is in prison for
a nice long term, she's lost her children, and she is classified as a
sexual predator.... turn around is a bitch.

<p>
The error in the case is that the state decision focused on the actions
of the man, that he was not releived of responsibility, however, it is
the actions of the woman, who granted that releif, that the state
ignored. Essentially she 'purchased' from him the debt to the child that
a father owes. Her suit in later years is essentially reneging on that
purchase agreement, and is attempting to reassign that debt back onto
the father.
