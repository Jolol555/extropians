I've been a computer hobbyist for a long time. In the late '70s,
<a name="0089qlink1">Byte magazine had a construction article on such a device,</a> and the software
to run it. the device was a hemisphere with the diameter of a tennis
ball. It had two buttons per finger, one under the fingertip and one under
the portion of finger nearest the palm. It had several buttons for the
thumb. The idea was that the finger position didn't change much.

<p>
There was a kit, also, with the buttons, the plastic hemisphere, and
other stuff. The user was supposed to customize the button positions
to fit the user's hand, so the device was personalized. users claimed
very high keying speeds, and the device was much cheaper than a keyboard.
keyboards weren't cheap back then.
