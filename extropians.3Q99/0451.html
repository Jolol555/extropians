<p>
I'm familiar with various yogic disciplines that begin this way, and then 
develop concentration by directed visualization. Not sure that's the way 
you're going with this observation. The main "skills" I developed in 
meditation practice were concentration, equanimity, and detachment. "I" would 
like to hear more about where you went with this.

(I see I was too telegraphic.)

<p>
Right, they're just models. It's a big revelation the first time you see 
this, and then it becomes more natural. Absent models and conventions, it's 
not possible to converse -- that's a big part of why we are so attached to 
"I" in the first place. 

<p>
To a great extent, too, we don't live in the real world, we live in our model 
of it. 

<p>
I don't share your low opinion of Minsky and Ornstein, but I think you read 
too much into my reference to them. Neither has anything like a complete 
theory of mind, it's just that what they formulated is more sophisticated 
than what preceded them. Neither they nor I said anything about the modules 
of "the" mind being easily comprehensible. If you're proceeding analytically 
to understand how the human CNS works, you need testable theories, just as in 
any other science. If your main interest is in synthesis, it doesn't 
ultimately matter whether your architecture is brain-like or not. (This would 
be a good place for a summary of current brain research, but catching up on 
that is on my to-do list).

<p>
<a href="0412.html#0451qlink3">&gt; The difference really is very much analogous to the difference between</a><br>
<i>&gt; graphical user interfaces and command-line systems, or between macroscopic</i><br>
<i>&gt; objects and microscopic physics.  When you deal with the low-level</i><br>
<i>&gt; elements of the mind, you have left the realms of the intuitively</i><br>
<i>&gt; comprehensible. -- </i><br>

<p>
The physics analogy seems more cogent to me. The mind, or at least the mind-
n-language, builds things the other way, refining image-like 
constructs (can't think of a good term, gestalts perhaps) into linear 
language.

<p>
If you get quiet enough, you can "watch" it do it, to some extent, or at 
least get a feel for the extent of the filtering and selection that's going 
on. I agree that a description of the process based only on introspection 
drags in a bunch of concepts that may or may not map to what the CNS is 
really doing.
