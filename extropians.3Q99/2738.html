<a href="2716.html#2738qlink1">&gt; Has it been 3 months already?  Oh, I guess it has.  OK, sure, we can argue</a><br>
<i>&gt; this one again.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; FWIW, here is my current best idea for implementing a truly free society</i><br>
<i>&gt; without getting everyone killed.  It all hinges on an idea for making</i><br>
<i>&gt; governments more fully subject to market forces:</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
But let's make it virtual and possible now for a bit of fun.

<p>
<a href="2716.html#2738qlink2">&gt; 1) Find someplace ininhabited to set up shop, so you don't have to deal</a><br>
<i>&gt; with</i><br>
<i>&gt; any messy problems on the issue of consent.  Anyone who doesn't like the</i><br>
<i>&gt; following proposal can simply go elsewhere and do something different.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
The Internet (well, you can always build an uninhabited bit)

<p>
<a href="2716.html#2738qlink3">&gt; 2) Start by claiming an expanse of physical space (preferably a solar</a><br>
<i>&gt; system, but something as small as a large asteroid might work.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Virtual space; lots of servers, add more as necessary, buy in by new
citizens could pay for such

<p>
<a href="2716.html#2738qlink4">&gt; 3) Set up a national government charged with defending said space.  Give</a><br>
<i>&gt; it</i><br>
<i>&gt; the power to raise a standing military force, collect taxes (but not</i><br>
<i>&gt; control</i><br>
<i>&gt; emmigration - so it is a lot more voluntary than current systems), and</i><br>
<i>&gt; conduct dimplomacy.  It also gets to have a few negative powers - it may</i><br>
<i>&gt; use</i><br>
<i>&gt; force to prevent local governments (see below) from making war on one</i><br>
<i>&gt; another, creating internal trade barriers, or preventing the free flow of</i><br>
<i>&gt; money and people from one locality to another.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Systems admin

<p>
<a href="2716.html#2738qlink5">&gt; 4) Set up a process by which citizens may create a local 'government'</a><br>
<i>&gt; spanning any unclaimed region of physical space the national government is</i><br>
<i>&gt; willing to try to defend, or any virtual space that they themselves have</i><br>
<i>&gt; created.  A local government could be anything from an authoritarian</i><br>
<i>&gt; mini-state to a completely ungoverned anarchy.  Its scope is limited only</i><br>
<i>&gt; in</i><br>
<i>&gt; that it is forbidden to infringe on the perrogatives of the national</i><br>
<i>&gt; government (i.e. defense and foreign policy).</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Mailing list owners

<p>
<a href="2716.html#2738qlink6">&gt; 5) Since a locality can not force people (or their money) to stay put, the</a><br>
<i>&gt; various local governments will find themselves competing for citizens.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Thus, we would expect that localities will evolve to actually give people</i><br>
<i>&gt; what they want.  Any vision of society that can actually work, and that</i><br>
<i>&gt; has</i><br>
<i>&gt; a significant number of adherents, should end up being implemented by at</i><br>
<i>&gt; least one locality.  Conversely, schemes that can not work well will tend</i><br>
<i>&gt; to</i><br>
<i>&gt; be weeded out by economic forces as businesses migrate to more hospitable</i><br>
<i>&gt; localities.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
People can join mailing lists at will, drop out at will. As a bonus, you can
have "citizenship" of multiple "nations"; as many as you can keep your
obligations to, and can be bothered joining.

<p>
<a href="2716.html#2738qlink7">&gt; A few obvious questions that I don't currently have good answers for:</a><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<i>&gt; 1) Should there be a national Bill of Rights, with some sort of national</i><br>
<i>&gt; police/court system empowered to enforce it?  Personally I think this is</i><br>
<i>&gt; giving the central government too much power for too little reason - if</i><br>
<i>&gt; some</i><br>
<i>&gt; people voluntarily choose to live in an oppresive locality, who are we to</i><br>
<i>&gt; stop them?  OTOH, there are some sticky issues involved if a locality</i><br>
<i>&gt; suddenly takes a turn off the deep end.  I think the key issue here is how</i><br>
<i>&gt; to make sure that no one ever has to live under a system that they haven't</i><br>
<i>&gt; explicitly agreed to.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
In a Mailing lists realm, it's not such a problem. But you still have to
look after meat-world.

<p>
<a href="2716.html#2738qlink8">&gt; 2) Is there some minimal criminal code that all localities should be</a><br>
<i>&gt; required to recognize?  This is a significant issue, since otherwise there</i><br>
<i>&gt; will be a market niche for localities that are hospitable to fugitive</i><br>
<i>&gt; criminals.  OTOH, it is difficult to devise an effective soluition to the</i><br>
<i>&gt; problem that does not compromise the whole nature of the system.  Perhaps</i><br>
<i>&gt; we</i><br>
<i>&gt; are better off leaving the market alone?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Also not a problem for e-mail world

<p>
<a href="2716.html#2738qlink9">&gt; 3) What kind of system should be created to make sure that localities can</a><br>
<i>&gt; not use false advertising to lure people into their sphere of influence,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and</i><br>
<i>&gt; then prevent them from leaving via devious, indirect methods?  Bear in</i><br>
<i>&gt; mind</i><br>
<i>&gt; here that we have to take into accound the potential for advanced</i><br>
<i>&gt; technologies like personality editing, mind copying, sentient AI,</i><br>
<i>&gt; borganisms, and 100% virtual worlds.  Giving the central government</i><br>
<i>&gt; sufficient police powers to investigate possible cases in detail would</i><br>
<i>&gt; make</i><br>
<i>&gt; it entirely too strong for comfort, but I don't like the idea of just</i><br>
<i>&gt; saying</i><br>
<i>&gt; 'caveat emptor' - these are people we are talking about, not dollars.</i><br>
<i>&gt; Maybe</i><br>
<i>&gt; we need an additional power group of some sort?</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
Caveat-emptor may do fine here

<p>
<a name="2748qlink1">Do you think that you could somehow attach control of real-world resources
to mailing lists? So various lists could actually make binding decisions
that affect the physical world? Then maybe you start getting</a> something like
<a name="2748qlink2">what Billy proposes above. You could eventually attach *all government* to
mailing lists which any person in the world was free to join or leave</a> at any
<a name="2748qlink3">time. Sounds pretty unstable to me, but I'd like to hear good reasons why
it'd work or not.</a>

<p>
There is a problem of people not living with the consequences of their
actions, which exists in e-mail world as well as Billy-world. Nations/Lists
could make popular, short term gain decisions which totally stuff up things
for that Nation/List in the long run. Then, when things get tricky, everyone
"defects" (quite legitimately).

<p>
<a name="2748qlink4">As Billy suggests, different styles of control could be tried by different
groups (democracy, rule by everyone (where everyone can vote</a> on everything),
<a name="2748qlink5">monarchy, dictatorships, corporate fun, etc...) and natural</a> selection should
<a name="2748qlink6">sort out the goats from the sheep. Although anyone who's ever played a
multiplayer strategy game will concurr that there are many</a> factors involved
<a name="2748qlink7">in surviving such a setup - looking weak can be real bad, looking</a> strong can
be REAL bad.

(By the way, does anyone remember Companion Set D&amp;D? As I recall, it listed
different forms of government as relates to different character classes like
so:
<pre>
	Magocracy - Government by Magic Users
	Theocracy - Government by Clerics
	Monarchy - Government by Fighters
	Democracy - Government by Thieves
</pre>

Earlier extropians ran TSR in the 80s, methinks.)
