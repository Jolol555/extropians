<a name="2769qlink1">I wonder what the value of this is.  Nearly anyone you ask about
high school is going to have experienced a period of feeling
'out', or rebelling against the clique system, even the so-called
popular kids!</a>

<p>
<a name="2769qlink2">Why don't we look at what our status is today?  Cyber-chic has
hit the mainstream, and our ideas are pretty darned hip by cultural
standards.  I have heavy-duty social life, as well as a lively
academic life, and some of the thinkers who have influenced me
the most I met on the party scene--
<br>
college professors, systems administrators, artists, etc.  People
are attracted to new ideas, however wierd, if you are friendly
and sociable about the way you present</a> it.

<p>
<a name="2769qlink3">On the other hand, if we wallow in this antisocial geek status,
then, well, it's only going to bring up images of Columbine and
other sociopathic acts.  High school is over with, get on with
life and have fun!</a>
