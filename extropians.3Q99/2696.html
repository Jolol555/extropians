I'd probably trust agribusiness more.  You probably have
a better chance of winning a suit against them if they
kill somebody or cause significant damage.

<p>
I *will* agree that the agribusiness suit *against* a farm
or business labeling their product as "organic", non-hormone
enhanced, etc. was pretty stupid.  But I also suspect that
*requiring* labels that the consumer is ill-qualified to interpret
may be just as bad.  [To give *full* disclosure would require
that every food product you buy come with a little booklet
like prescription drugs do.]

<p>
Do you want you computer monitor to come labeled with warning --
!!!DEVICE PRODUCES X-RAYS AND HAS HIGH-STRENGTH MAGNETIC FIELDS!!!
what are your children going to think of that (even if you know
the risks are low)?
<br>
  Daddy, are X-rays dangerous?
<br>
  Yes, sun, they cause mutations that can kill you.
  Daddy, then shouldn't I not use the computer monitor?
  No, son, its been certified to be safe.
  Daddy, then why is there the big warning label on the monitor?
  ...

<p>
Should your automobile come with a warning:
THIS DEVICE IF OPERATED IMPROPERLY CAN CAUSE INJURY AND EVEN DEATH!

<p>
Come on.  Here is what works -- you certify consumers (by exam)
to be able to interpret or not interpret correctly the contents
of labels of varying complexity.  If you can *prove* you understand
what the label says you can buy the product, if you can't
prove you can understand it, you get the product labeled at
the level you can understand.  Most likely the immigrant fresh
off the boat buys the can that says simply "BEANS" in 47 languages.

<p>
So, someone who proves they can understand the statistics
of dose-response relationships, and a variety of other
factors involving human physiology, medicine, genetics, etc.
can buy the products that say:
<br>
 "This product contains/does-not-contain growth hormone"

<p>
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing in the wrong hands.
Its like giving a child a g*n, if they aren't trained and/or
supervised they could end up hurting themselves with it.

<a name="2700qlink2">I don't recall it, but it sounds like a cheap shot.  I would
bet they dressed that way to keep from tracking foreign pollen
into the crop.  Or it might have been very early on in the trials
when they were still unsure of the safety.  You might recall
the early debates about genetic engineering (mid-'70s).
Many people thought it was very dangerous and should be stopped.
They came up with some sensible systems for classifying the
levels of danger (P1-P4 containment) and now you have high
school kids doing gene transfer experiements.</a>

<p>

<a href="2693.html#2696qlink4">&gt; I agree, lets require truth in label laws for genetically</a><br>
<i>&gt; engineered content and let the consumer decide.</i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
I'll have to agree to disagree.  Whether we are arguing
product labels or education (such as giving people
belief systems that explain "evil" and have magical
fantasy places where everything is nice (and boring));
you should not give people information that they are
not qualified to adequately judge.   Wait until someone
is 18 (or maybe even older), then give them all the
religious systems in the world and let them pick one.

<p>
With regard to technical scientific discussions
I would say that the people should trust the
scientists to weigh the evidence and make reasonable
recomendations.  The problem with the Ag-Bio debate
(unlike the early genetic engineering discussions
or even say the nuclear armament discussions, is
that it doesn't appear to me that there are many
qualified scientists on the side of the luddites).

<p>
Now, if you want that system to work, you have to make sure
that the government is aware of the problem, is watching
the industry to make sure they aren't sneaking a fast one
by us, has the authority to regulate things reasonably
(something they can't seem to get right on the internet),
and has methods for enforcement, etc.

<p>
I'm *not* sure whether this is true with Ag-bio because
I don't know it well enough.  I would say they seem to be
reasonably prudent in producing, testing and introducing
things and the government seems to be watching them to
some degree.  Any complaints that the industry is acting
in its self-interest (in engineering sterile seeds,
producing herbicide resistant plants, patents, etc.) can
only be fixed in a capitalistic system (assuming government
regulation is undesirable) by the introduction of 
competition (e.g. the production of fertile seeds)
from organizations with the interests of the population as
a whole in mind (e.g. non-profit foundations *or* the
government itself).
