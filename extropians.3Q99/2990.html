Hi Kathryn,

<p>
I'm new to the List (but "old" to the issues). My two cents here
is that you've put two separate issues under 5, and I'd like to
add a demographics-related 3rd point (#7 -- I know you didn't
ask for new points! Sorry!):

<p>
5.   Demographics-- bad for PR.

<p>
6.   Demographics-- bad for transhumanism itself (sources for
new ideas are limited).

<p>
7.   Demographics-- suggestive of a blind spot, a lack of
self-awareness of our motives, perhaps even a _problem_ with our
motives? Or perhaps simply: worth thinking about?

<p>
I'm a Nietzschean, and a perennial self-doubter, but, doubt
aside, I think it's worth asking what the _extreme_ demographic
skewedness can tell us about our views themselves: whence the
views, what might they aim at that goes beyond what we normally
tell ourselves is the aim? (etc.).

<p>
We typically answer these questions from within transhumanism
itself, which is, in the end, not to answer them at all (for the
same reason a pragmatist isn't answering the question Why
pragmatism? when s/he replies: "Because it works.")

<p>
Best,
<br>
Brian.
