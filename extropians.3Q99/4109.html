Hello again,

<p>
Personally I think we could appeal successfully to the american public on 
the basis of civil liberties and the interest in science as a means of life 
extension(even if that is cryonics).  We would not be once and for all 
ending a life but hopefully just giving it a period of inactivity.  
Religious groups could fault us for trying to escape the relative short span 
of life at present but not for wanting to simply end life before it's time.  
Even disability groups might become interested in our message of a better 
world that we are trying to reach.  They would have reason more then the 
average person to receive our message.

<p>
I realize this matter has been argued in court before and defeated but I 
just wonder if through shrewd public campaigning with the right allies we 
could have the perceptions here changed because in actuality our ultimate 
aim is far different then the hemlock society and other right to die groups. 
  Perhaps we should disassociate with them and carry a torch forward just 
for ourselves since our motivations are so vastly different.  Is this simply 
a matter of needing a hundred million dollars for a public relations 
campaign to sway the national opinion on the matter followed by a massive 
legal challenge?  Or could this be done on the relative small scale and 
still be taken all the way to the supreme court for hopefully a positive 
outcome?

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
