Maybe, but I can think of reasons why that might not happen.  Assuming
even that solar cells became so cheap that they were effectively free, we
would still have the expense of packaging and installing them.  That's
not trivial, as they have to be positioned to effectively catch the
sunlight while at the same time being sufficiently protected from the
weather and other hazards.  Perhaps the cheapest way to install them is
to apply them flush to the surface of an existing pitched roof, but most
existing roofs are not ideally angled and oriented for that.  Arranging
for the angle to be adjustable, either occasionally with seasonal changes
or adaptively during the day would be an additional expense.  But perhaps
'solar shingles' will be developed which would allow a solar installation
as part of original roof construction or re-roofing.


<p>
Then there is the problem of storing energy.  Not all days are sunny, and
even on sunny days the cells will produce useful output for only a few
hours.  The hardware to store, manage, and voltage-regulate the energy
would be quite expensive, at least with today's technology.  Maintenance
of the hardware is an additional cost.  My electric bill is about $40 per
month, so it would be necessary for a system with a 10 year life span to
cost less than about $5,000 installed for it to be even a marginally
attractive investment.
