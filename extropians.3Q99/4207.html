Some months ago, I picked the collective brains of this list for ideas
for a libertarian/transhumanist society for a roleplaying setting I'm
running. Now I would like to get some more input, this time on a
somewhat complicated constitutional crisis caused by cognitive
hacking.

<p>
The basic situation is this: the planet New America (see
<a href="http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/BigIdeas/NA.html">http://www.nada.kth.se/~asa/Game/BigIdeas/NA.html</a>) has a constitution
fairly similar to the current US. Off-planet infiltrators bringing
nanodevices able to reprogram the loyalties of people (essentially
similar to the loyalty mods of Egan's _Quarantine_) have appeared,
attempting to set up cells and convert people (especially political
leaders) to their cause. However, the infiltration attempt was
revealed before they had got a firm hold of everything, and a major
struggle to prevent the spread of reprogramming has begun. The
infiltrators have problems producing large quantities of nanodevices,
brainwashing takes a while and they cannot easily identify each other
without setting up a good code system, but on the other hand the
authorities cannot determine if somebody is infected without a
combined fMRI scan and psychological test which takes a long time.
Needless to say, the situation is chaotic and many space habitats and
islands isolate themselves from anybody out of fear of infection.

<p>
<a name="4235qlink1">Now, the problem: the president and her cabinet may or may not have
<a name="4458qlink1">been infiltrated, congress may be more or less infiltrated, as well as
the supreme court and most of the armed forces (one half of the space
navy is provably non-infected). Of course, everybody claims to have
avoided infection. How would the different sides handle this according
to the constitutuion? The closest precedent or legal approximation for
</a>
the infection would be insanity, or possibly being an enemy spy. Is
<a name="4212qlink1">there a way of handling the possibility that practically all of the
higher leadership of the US/NA could be insane/spies? Would the
</a>
<a name="4235qlink2"><a name="4212qlink2">non-infected armed forces be allowed to take temporary leadership?
</a>
<a name="4235qlink3"><a name="4212qlink3">What could the infected politicians (whoever they are) do to
</a>
interfere?
</a>
</a>
</a>

[ It is a very fun roleplaying campaign, which will be posted in its<br>
entirety to the net soonish. Lots of nanotech, AI and interstellar
socioeconomics. Last session we dealt with the story of a small
mercenary/PI firm run by telepresence and an AI boss hired by the two
employees/owners to lead them.
