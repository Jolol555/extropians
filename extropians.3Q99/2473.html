<i>&gt; </i><br>
This makes sense.  18+ month old rats are middle-aged (probably 40+ humans).
Since it is likely that the processes by which CR works are a general
slowing down of the wear-and-tear processes (DNA damage, oxidative
stress, perhaps lower glucose levels, retarding the accumulation
of damaged proteins, etc.) the later that you begin the CR, the
less of an effect it will have.  If you begin CR too late, any
effects will be masked by the normal variability in longevity
and will not be statistically significant.

<p>
All of the reports on the studies of primates undergoing CR 
(currently being done) are however consistent with the rodent
studies and demonstrate the biochemical changes you would
want to create given the various hypothesis regarding the
various causes of aging.
