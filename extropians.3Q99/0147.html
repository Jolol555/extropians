<a href="0145.html#0147qlink1">&gt;It seems to me that there is a mystery that deserves to be investigated </a><br>
here, for &gt;if all these people are lying or are mistaken about natural 
phenomena, yet &gt;consistently repeats the same hallucinatory details, then 
that is surely &gt;something that needs to be investigated by psychologists. 

<p>
This is certainly a problematic manner.  Scientifically, it's a win-win 
situation, yet no one seems game; the subject's been thoroughly hidden behind 
the laughter curtain for so long that even bright people scoff at it (though 
surveys show that the more highly educated one is, the more likely one is to 
accept the possibility of an otherworldy presence here on Earth.  I didn't 
say "alien presence" because I don't remember the particulars of the survey, 
and anyway, "alien" usually translates to "extraterrestrial" in the typical 
Western mind, which only distorts the issue.)

<p>
Michael Persinger of Laurentian University is one of the few and the brave.  
He's devised an electromagnetic helmet that stimulates the temporal lobe and 
can cause some of the visionary strangeness that accompanies certain 
"abduction" episodes.  His work builds on that of Paul Devereux, a critic of 
the ET Hypothesis who thinks UFOs are "earthlights" produced by electricity 
in the planet's crust prior to seismic activity.  

<p>
Albert Budden goes even further and posits that people who come in close 
contact with these "electroforms" (not to be confused with ball lightening) 
experience abductions and other paranormal activity as part of their brain's 
organic response, in a sense dealing with accute distress by dressing it up 
in culturally relevant symbolism.  _Earthmind_ and _Psychic Close Encounters_ 
are two recommended books on this approach (which has a lot going for it, 
though it doesn't satisfactorily explain mass sightings of structured craft, 
etc.)

<p>
A quote that huants me is from Strieber's "Communion": "Maybe the visitors 
are simply what evolution looks like when applied to a conscience mind."
