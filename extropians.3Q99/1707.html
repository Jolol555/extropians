I really don't know about lemurs but a chimp can bring its thumb against its
palm and that works OK for a power grip. I was under the impression that
only a human can bring his thumb against the tips of the 4 other fingers
and that's what you need for a precision grip.

By the way, Darwin sounds like a great pet.
