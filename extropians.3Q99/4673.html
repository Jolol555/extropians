I know, sometimes it is hard to read that.  People don't usually mean it to
be that critical, but more to amplify and add to a thought.  It doesn't
mean that something was wrong with the original statement, but that people
actually read it and thought about it, which means that they took it
seriously.

Have you ever done martial arts?  In a dojo, once you get out on the mat,
no one is better than anyone else.  Still, each student is expected to push
themself hard, learning from those more skilled and leading by example
those who are newer.  After practice matches, even if you get your butt
kicked, you realize you've had a lot of fun and a good workout, and that
everyone respects you for being out there and trying.  Our debates could be
viewed like those practice matches.  Hope that you will stick around!
