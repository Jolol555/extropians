Everything's inevitable but nothing's obvious.  We saw the train coming, we
produced time tables and other painfully analogous things, and that's
probably worth a toast.  Just so long as we don't miss the next train.

[Maybe someone (who has both been on this list since it started *and* can
remember what happened) could rummage through the archives and repost some
'classic' extropian material from the good ol' days as a toast to our new
found obviousness.]
