Dear friends:

<p>
<a name="1229qlink1">Please read the NEWS RELEASE below.  The situation for the future of 
U.S. space exploration continues to get worse -- Congress is now
considering a cut of nearly 30% to Space Science, devastating planetary
exploration, and most likely eliminating missions to Mars, Europa,
Pluto, comets and asteroids.

<p>
These actions are solely the result of political infighting about
budget surpluses!  They have nothing to do with the merits of the
space program.
</a>

<p>
This is the most devastating attack on planetary exploration in 20
years.  We are asking everyone who cares about the future in space --
whether from the U.S. or from other nations -- to write letters to the
U.S. Congress about this issue, before FRIDAY July 30! 

<p>
Address your letters to:

HOUSE SPACE SCIENCE CUTS MOST DEVASTATING IN HISTORY OF AMERICA'S SPACE
PROGRAM

<p>
PASADENA The House VA-HUD-IA Appropriations Subcommittee this evening voted to
slash $1.3 billion from NASA's FY 2000 budget, which, could will cripple the 
agency and force the termination of many critical space science missions, 
according to Dr. Louis Friedman, Executive Director of The Planetary Society. 

<p>
"The House action gives new meaning to 'deep impact'", said Friedman.  "The
space science cuts are the most devastating in NASA's history and effectively
curtail space exploration after 2001.  It's an irresponsible budget that does
terrible harm to America's future." 

<p>
"NASA's budget has been reduced every year since 1992, and the proposed cuts
would be the coup de grace,"  Friedman added.   "In the last decade NASA has
led the federal government in accomplishing more for less.   Now, these gains
will be lost."

<p>
The Congressional action ironically occurs as NASA astronauts are in orbit
launching Chandra, a new great observatory.   

<p>
The House $1.3 billion cutback is about 10 percent of NASA's total funding
($13.665 billion).  But the cut to the space science program, now $2.2
billion,
<br>
is $640 million -- 29 percent!   

<p>
If this action is passed by the full Congress, the planetary missions that
would probably be terminated include:


<UL>
  <li>  All missions to Mars after 2001, including the international sample return
mission in 2005.   
  <li>  All Discovery missions after Stardust 
  <li>  The Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF) 
  <li>  The Europa orbiter 
  <li>  Missions to the outer planets 
  <li>  Explorer Program missions 


</UL>
<p>
Additional space and Earth science missions would also be cancelled.

<p>
"The House cuts fly in the face of recent Congressional studies that recommend
investing more -- not less -- in science and technology," Friedman said.  The
full House recently passed the NASA authorization bill, which boosts spending
above the Administration's request.

<p>
"If the House is truly serious about these cutbacks, it should hold
hearings to
<br>
allow for public comment," Friedman said.  "At a minimum, a full and open
debate about alternatives to ending the American role in space exploration
should be held."
