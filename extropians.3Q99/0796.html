Along the meridian thru Paris!  Yes, but that was a long time ago.
For most of its history, IIRC, the meter was defined as the distance
between two scratches on a certain rod in that city.

It is true that now, in a sense, the speed of light is a matter of
arithmetic definition like the number of feet in a mile (or the number
of francs in a Euro).  However, that is true only of the light from
the abovementioned spectral line.  Whether _all_ electromagnetic
radiation travels at the same speed is still an empirical question.
In particular, if the photon turned out to have a nonzero rest mass
(which would be shocking, but is not inconceivable), then the constant
c in Einstein's equation would not be the actual speed of any light,
but only the limit as the frequency approached infinity (wavelength
approached zero).
