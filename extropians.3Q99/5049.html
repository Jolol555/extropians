People who chose to be offended at something deserve it. If you are offended
at something someone says (not does, but says), then either a) they are
doing it on purpose, and you're charging the cape, or b) they're not doing
it on purpose, and by being offended you're just being irritable, or c) they
are very stupid, and rather then being mad you should dismiss them. The only
reasons to be offended at anything if if it's something someone actually
does - or if it's something they say about what they're going to do and they
have the means to do it. I'm really not even sure what it feels like to be
offended at something someone says..
