No, the problem is that we don't have collaborative filtering.  CF is
the ideal solution for this; it acts as an attention-amplifier that lets
you pay indirect attention to corporate ethics every time you select a
brand of laundry detergent.  Working CF is fundamentally necessary to
any pragmatic attempt to create a truly libertarian market, because
otherwise the difficulty of paying attention will create demands for
government regulation to ensure environmental responsibility, product
safety...  The libertarian response of "So don't buy unethical or unsafe
products" is fine in theory.  In practice, it works to the exact degree
a consumer knows what ve's buying.

<p>
Obviously, CF is also important to maintaining a representative democracy.

<p>
Go CFers!
