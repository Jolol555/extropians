  I also had a childhood experience similar to this one. My adoptive
grandparents lived in a desert area in Northern California called Termo.
There was no electricity or city water to speak of. Water was drawn in by a
windmill of considerable height, leading directly into a trough where the
water was then retrieved by gallon jugs, from there it traveled down a pipe
into a man made pond.

<p>
I would visit this 40 acres of red rock roads and sagebrush land on
particular holidays and summers.
<br>
In this trough there were approximately five or six 6inched size goldfish.
(The largest I've ever seen)
<br>
In the winter this water would freeze up into one block of ice, and the fish
were frozen still in this state.
<br>
Summer came and a few other kids and I noticed that the fish were once again
swimming around.

<p>
 I inquired and was told that they were the same fish. Not believing this
story, I took matters into my own hands. I went thru three different
solutions and markers before finding one that would stick. I placed blue
marks on the sides of the fish, sure enough a year passed and the fish thru
the process of winter and summer, swam once again, blue marks intact. They
were the same fish.

<a href="1412.html#1429qlink1">&gt;Hello everyone. I just thought I'd write down a little childhood memory to</a><br>
<i>&gt;share with the list, as those of you who are interested in cryonic</i><br>
<i>&gt;suspension may find it amuzing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;As a young boy, I grew up in the North West Territories of Canada, in a</i><br>
<i>&gt;small town call Inuvik. Inuvik strangely would give me my first introuction</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the idea of cryonic suspension. I lived there for five years, and each</i><br>
<i>&gt;spring the same amazing event happened in our school yard. As the warm</i><br>
<i>&gt;winds started to move in to town, and the snow and ice began to thaw, large</i><br>
<i>&gt;chunks of hard ice would start sliding off of the roof of the school. What</i><br>
<i>&gt;my friends and I soon discovered to our delight were flies encased in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;ice. They had spent the entire 9 months of the winter frozen solid in ice</i><br>
<i>&gt;which formed on the aluminum roofing of the school. At recess we would chip</i><br>
<i>&gt;out dozens of ice chunks holding these flies, and sneak them back into the</i><br>
<i>&gt;classroom with us. Then we would hide them in the garbage pail and about an</i><br>
<i>&gt;hour into the class the ice would have thawed and amazingly, the flies</i><br>
<i>&gt;would thaw as well and soon there would be dozens of house flies buzzing</i><br>
<i>&gt;around annoying the teacher. It was always amuzing to have flies buzzing</i><br>
<i>&gt;about when the land was still covered in snow and the temperature outside</i><br>
<i>&gt;was just above freezing!</i><br>
<i>&gt;Does anyone know how common such types of hibernation are in the animal</i><br>
<i>&gt;kingdom? I've heard of frogs and such that hibernate in the ground, but</i><br>
<i>&gt;they must still remain warm enough that they don't freeze solid. These</i><br>
<i>&gt;little house flies (at least they looked like ordinary house flies) were</i><br>
<i>&gt;frozen solid in the ice. There can't have been any liquid in them during</i><br>
<i>&gt;the winters. But they managed to thaw out and fly around as soon as the ice</i><br>
<i>&gt;melted off of them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Strange, bu true.</i><br>
<i>&gt;--Aaron</i><br>
