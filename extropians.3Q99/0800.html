I have similar thoughts, that in the end it may be easier to contact
ETIs by first contacting the Architects in Universe Prime, and use them
as a network to contact races elsewhere in this universe.

On a related note, I just read the last book in David Brin's second
uplift trilogy, which anyone on the list can tell he wrote after having
spent some time on our list and studying extropian and transhumanist
thought, though at the end he seems to be of the impression that
transcended beings that accumulate around black holes are a dead end,
that the black holes are actually just trash bins to clear out the older
races to make room for the newer ones.
