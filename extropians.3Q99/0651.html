<a href="0637.html#0651qlink1">&gt;The "keep an open mind" mantra is usually spouted by the</a><br>
<i>&gt;most closed-minded mystics who refuse to even entertain</i><br>
<i>&gt;the idea that the mind can do these things.  Frankly, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;find that insulting.  Of course the mind can do it--every</i><br>
<i>&gt;experience you have is processed by that wonderfully</i><br>
<i>&gt;complex machine of your brain; why should it be any more</i><br>
<i>&gt;immune to an occasional malfunction than any other machine?</i><br>

<p>
I'm in agreement for the most part, but I'd argue that what you 
term "malfunctions" (and many of the experiences you're referring 
to are just that) are sometimes extremely functional--though not 
from my personal viewpoint.  It looks as if religion, for example, 
evolved as a social mechanism to enable large groups to retain 
solidarity.  There is a great Darwinian need for this.  We've even 
isolated the "religion complex" to a specific site in the brain.  So 
while a religious epiphany may well be a fortuitous interplay of 
neurochemicals and wishful thinking, I wouldn't call it a _malfunction_. 
Rather, a "vestigial reflex"...or at least I'd like to think of it as 
vestigial.  
<br>
Looking at culture in general, though, makes me think twice...
