There is a fine line between being sufficiently skeptical
and blindly assuming something isn't the case.</a> And for what its
worth you and Crocker are wrong, and this despite your own 300+ IQ
and 1600 SAT scores.  Assuming you're actually reading this
post and I did not end up in your 'bogus' filter a few months
back (itself a flattery) then perhaps I'll point out exactly why
such consistent dogmatic thinking on your's and Crocker's
part does such a great disservice to rational thinkers everywhere.

<a name="0989qlink1">Nobody holds your dogmatism against you either, as it is a common
behavior amongst high-IQ young people.<a name="0950qlink2">  Just because I don't believe
in psychic powers either, does not mean I must dogmatically believe
they don't exist because of insufficient evidence.  The only rational choice
left is *to not believe in anything*.
