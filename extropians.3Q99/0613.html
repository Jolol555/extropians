<p>
For a novel that's even more like Sagan's novel than the previously mentioned 
"Songs from the Stars" (Norman Spinrad), try James Gunn's "The Listeners," 
which is a fairly rigorous treatment of the "science vs. religion" that Sagan 
attempts.  I wouldn't call either novel especially good, but they're very 
similar (only Gunn's novel depicts the aliens as virtual clones of humans; 
their interstellar broadcast is a near dead-ringer for the one we sent from 
Arecibo).

<p>
Radio transmission has never been popular in science fiction, for good 
reason: it's boring.  Now that the Internet is the rage, the "interstellar 
Net" concept is gaining popularity.  Spinrad's book was prescient.

<p>
Did anyone see the movie "Virus" a few months ago?  It was stupid and cheesy, 
but the rough premise was straight out of "Mind Children."
