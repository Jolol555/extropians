<a href="1986.html#2008qlink1">&gt; &gt; Just read an article about his brain, that scientists have found that</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; there was an area he was missing in his brain that allowed the part</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; responsible for mathematical visualization to grow to twice the normal</i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt; size...</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt; Which area was that? As far as I know, most studies on his brain have</i><br>
<i>&gt; been cellular rather than morphological (he may have hadd a slightly</i><br>
<i>&gt; different number of glial cells; I'll get back to that once I have</i><br>
<i>&gt; finished reading the reviews on the brain effects of enriched</i><br>
<i>&gt; environments, they seem to relate here).</i><br>

<p>
Are you talking about Einstein? (I just subbed). If so, you're partially
correct - he had a larger number of glial cells when compared to a man
of average intellect. Also, his parietal lobe was slightly larger -- but
he wasn't "missing" anything AFAIK. If you could post sources that'd be
nice.
