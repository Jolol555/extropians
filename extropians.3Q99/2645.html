<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;++ SECOND INTERNATIONAL CONVENTION OF THE MARS SOCIETY A SMASHING SUCCESS </i><br>
<i>&gt;++</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The words had a familiar ring: "Hi, I'm Bob Zubrin, president of the Mars </i><br>
<i>&gt;Society." So began the Second International Convention of the Mars Society, </i><br>
<i>&gt;a meeting that not only recalled the promise of the first, but delivered on </i><br>
<i>&gt;it as well. If 1998 was the year with the buzz, 1999 was the year with the </i><br>
<i>&gt;beef.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While there were numerous stars at this year's convention, none shone </i><br>
<i>&gt;brighter than the Mars Arctic Research Station, a project conceived during </i><br>
<i>&gt;last year's meeting. Proposed in 1998 as the Society's first major project, </i><br>
<i>&gt;numerous sessions and plenary talks addressed the facility's design and </i><br>
<i>&gt;potential. More important, though, the Society announced that the M.A.R.S. </i><br>
<i>&gt;would be delivered, built, and open for use by researchers in July 2000. A </i><br>
<i>&gt;Mars Society field team exploring the Haughton Impact Crater on Devon </i><br>
<i>&gt;Island in the Canadian Arctic identified two possible sites for </i><br>
<i>&gt;establishing the base, with the primary site residing on the crater's rim, </i><br>
<i>&gt;high on a ridge dubbed "Haynes Ridge" hard by "von Braun Planitia." Not bad </i><br>
<i>&gt;for a year's work.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This year's convention saw approximately 700 paid attendees packing morning </i><br>
<i>&gt;plenaries and evening panels, and, during the afternoons, racing between </i><br>
<i>&gt;numerous talks divvied up between four to five separate tracks. With an </i><br>
<i>&gt;additional 300 people attending a public session one convention's opening </i><br>
<i>&gt;day, total conference attendance approached 1,000. Some highlights from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;days and nights in Boulder:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- Robert Zubrin, president of the Mars Society, gave a rousing opening </i><br>
<i>&gt;address in which he laid out the historic opportunity before the Society: </i><br>
<i>&gt;The possibility of turning the first decade of the 21st century into the </i><br>
<i>&gt;opening of one of the greatest eras of exploration in history by helping </i><br>
<i>&gt;launch a humans to Mars program.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- Pascal Lee, head of the Mars Arctic Base Task Force, reporting on the </i><br>
<i>&gt;progress of the M.A.R.S. project and transporting several hundred people </i><br>
<i>&gt;via words and stunning images to the Mars-like landscapes of the Haughton </i><br>
<i>&gt;Crater.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- James Cameron, the current king of Hollywood if not the world, reporting </i><br>
<i>&gt;on his plans for bringing Mars to the public via a five-hour television </i><br>
<i>&gt;mini-series and a 3-D Imax film, and publicly and proudly announcing </i><br>
<i>&gt;himself a "wacko" for Mars. Cameron's stated intent is to present the human </i><br>
<i>&gt;exploration of Mars as a huge technical challenge, but one that we are </i><br>
<i>&gt;ready to meet and achieve. He proceeded to thrill an absolutely packed hall </i><br>
<i>&gt;with images of some of the vehicles he and his team have designed for the </i><br>
<i>&gt;projects, including landers, habs and rovers("We're not engineers," he </i><br>
<i>&gt;said. "We're film makers, so you're just gonna have to cut us some slack," </i><br>
<i>&gt;though it hardly seemed necessary.). There was a definite buzz in the hall </i><br>
<i>&gt;as he explained the technical details of his pressurized rover design, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;a an even bigger buzz when word later got out that he might consider </i><br>
<i>&gt;loaning the production vehicle to the Mars Society for use on Devon Island </i><br>
<i>&gt;once his film projects are in the can.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- An intriguing, thought provoking talk by sci-fi author Kim Stanley </i><br>
<i>&gt;Robinson on reasons for going -- and not going -- to Mars. Robinson's talk </i><br>
<i>&gt;questioned some of the more cherished rationales for the human exploration  </i><br>
<i>&gt; and settlement of Mars -- visions of the frontier and "manifest destiny" </i><br>
<i>&gt;-- and offered a vision of Mars exploration as an ecological "green </i><br>
<i>&gt;project." Most memorable, though, was his admonition against allowing the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Society to fracture into warring groups because of minor disagreements over </i><br>
<i>&gt;substance or style, and his enthusiasm in leading more than 500 people in a </i><br>
<i>&gt;raise-your-right-hand-and-repeat-after-me pledge to "renounce the </i><br>
<i>&gt;narcissism of small differences."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- The clusters of individuals -- five, ten, sometimes more -- that came </i><br>
<i>&gt;together in meetings to define new tasks for the Society, discuss new </i><br>
<i>&gt;projects, and organize themselves for action. Hand-written notices tacked </i><br>
<i>&gt;on a board near the meeting's registration desk announced meetings of </i><br>
<i>&gt;people interested in public outreach, political action, chapter </i><br>
<i>&gt;organization, e-commerce, student involvement and more. Sometimes under the </i><br>
<i>&gt;bright Boulder sun, sometimes in the quiet confines of otherwise empty </i><br>
<i>&gt;halls, energies were directed into action.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- A panel of nearly a dozen Mars Society members and speakers who each </i><br>
<i>&gt;answered the question "What kind of Mars do we want?" Though no two shared </i><br>
<i>&gt;quite the same dream, it was clear that all shared a mutual respect of one </i><br>
<i>&gt;another's ideas and the freedom to express them. The visions of a future </i><br>
<i>&gt;Mars were intriguing, and the discussions spirited.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- The image of more than 500 people donning red/blue 3-D glasses to gaze </i><br>
<i>&gt;at 3-D images presented by Peter Smith, principal investigator for cameras </i><br>
<i>&gt;carried on the Mars Pathfinder lander and the Mars Polar Lander. In </i><br>
<i>&gt;addition to some stunning 3-D views from the Mars Pathfinder mission, Smith </i><br>
<i>&gt;also outlined the upcoming Mars Polar Lander mission and detailed the </i><br>
<i>&gt;capabilities of the lander's cameras.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- Katherine Harris, this year's winner of the Hakluyt Prize, reading from </i><br>
<i>&gt;a letter she wrote and sent to more than two dozen political and space </i><br>
<i>&gt;leaders urging their support of human Mars exploration.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- The antics of Monk's Night Out, an Austin, Texas-based improvisational </i><br>
<i>&gt;comedy troupe offering more than a bit of levity during Saturday night's </i><br>
<i>&gt;banquet. What will we find on Mars? Duct tape.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- The slew of ideas presented over the span of 18 tracks, ranging from the </i><br>
<i>&gt;private exploration of Mars, to the law and governance on Mars, to Mars art </i><br>
<i>&gt;and aesthetics.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- The amiable thrust and parry between University of Colorado professor </i><br>
<i>&gt;Bruce Jakosky and NASA Ames researcher and Mars Underground co-founder </i><br>
<i>&gt;Chris McKay on the role of robots and humans in Mars exploration; the </i><br>
<i>&gt;possibilities of extant life on Mars; the pace of Mars exploration; and </i><br>
<i>&gt;more. The two engaged in lucid, intelligent, and sometimes wry debate on a </i><br>
<i>&gt;number of issues to the delight of appreciative audience.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- Society Administrative Director Maggie Zubrin and Fundraising Task Force </i><br>
<i>&gt;leader Kristin Boekhoff circulating pledge cards during Saturday's banquet </i><br>
<i>&gt;and later announcing that $6,000 had been raised over the course of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;evening.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- The unanimous vote by the Steering Committee to accept a bid by the Mars </i><br>
<i>&gt;Society's Toronto chapter to host the convention in their city in the year </i><br>
<i>&gt;2000. It reflected the Society's confidence in its members and its </i><br>
<i>&gt;commitment to operate as a truly international organization. Following </i><br>
<i>&gt;presentations by Robert Zubrin and Pascal Lee on the current situation of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Arctic base project, the Steering Committee also voted formally to </i><br>
<i>&gt;commit the funds required to build and establish the first module of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Mars Arctic Research Station on Devon Island during the summer of 2000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;-- The closing plenary session, wherein Chris McKay, Pascal Lee and Robert </i><br>
<i>&gt;Zubrin spoke of what the Mars Society had accomplished this year and at the </i><br>
<i>&gt;conference, what all the Society's members could expect over the course of </i><br>
<i>&gt;the next year, and the conference's closing words:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"On to Toronto. On to Mars!"</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;++ SOCIETY WINS NASA MARS POLAR LANDER MIRROR WEBSITE ++</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Mars Society's has been chosen by NASA to provide a "mirror" website </i><br>
<i>&gt;for the Mars Polar Lander mission, which will touch down on Mars December </i><br>
<i>&gt;3, 1999. The 1997 Pathfinder mission marked the last time NASA landed on </i><br>
<i>&gt;Mars, and, during that mission, the Pathfinder site became one of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;busiest websites of all time. During the first month of the landing, the </i><br>
<i>&gt;site had over 500 million hits with nearly 2-1/2 million people visiting. </i><br>
<i>&gt;In comparison, the Mars Society currently serves 50,000 monthly visitors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This is a great opportunity for the Mars Society. As people visit the main </i><br>
<i>&gt;NASA Mars Polar Lander site they will be given a choice as to which mirror </i><br>
<i>&gt;site they would like to use. Naturally some people will be intrigued that </i><br>
<i>&gt;one of the sites is being hosted by the Mars Society. Visitors will be </i><br>
<i>&gt;given an opportunity to learn about the Mars Society and its goals. This </i><br>
<i>&gt;agreement will bring significant public exposure for the Mars Society as we </i><br>
<i>&gt;head into the new millennium and near a human to Mars mission.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The winning proposal for the mirror website was written by Marc Boucher, </i><br>
<i>&gt;the Mars Society's webmaster. Well done, Marc!</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;++ ALL OUT FIGHT PENDING TO SAVE NASA SPACE EXPLORATION PROGRAMS ++</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It seems there's always a calm before the storm during the late days of </i><br>
<i>&gt;summer, no more so this year then on Capitol Hill, where the late summer </i><br>
<i>&gt;recess is due to come to an end after Labor Day, and the fight against some </i><br>
<i>&gt;of the biggest budget cuts in NASA's history will commence once again.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<a href="1213.html#2645qlink1">&gt;You'll recall that a House Appropriations subcommittee delivered a NASA </a><br>
<i>&gt;appropriations bill that would have slashed more than $1.3 billion from </i><br>
<i>&gt;NASA's FY2000 budget. Mars mission funding would be cut; Discovery and </i><br>
<i>&gt;Explorer mission funding curtailed; SIRTF and the CONTOUR mission </i><br>
<i>&gt;cancelled. While the full House Appropriations Committee restored $400 </i><br>
<i>&gt;million in funding and partially resurrected a space science budget that </i><br>
<i>&gt;hand been shredded (and restored Mars mission funding), it still left NASA </i><br>
<i>&gt;facing a $900 million budget cut. A full House floor debate on the bill was </i><br>
<i>&gt;delayed until after recess. While the Senate has not addressed the NASA </i><br>
<i>&gt;budget directly yet, word is that NASA can't expect any lifelines tossed in </i><br>
<i>&gt;its direction: the Senate Appropriations Committee will probably seek about </i><br>
<i>&gt;$1 billion in cuts to the NASA budget as well.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;While some cuts may be restored when Senate and House conferees meet later </i><br>
<i>&gt;this Fall, there is likely to be a substantial cut in NASA's budget when </i><br>
<i>&gt;all is said and done, and it's rather unlikely that a Republican Congress </i><br>
<i>&gt;will vote down an appropriations bill endorsed by the leadership of the </i><br>
<i>&gt;House and Senate. As such, the White House will possibly be presented with </i><br>
<i>&gt;a VA-HUD appropriations bill that slashes the NASA budget while increasing </i><br>
<i>&gt;other programs -- most notably Veterans. Vetoing such a bill could prove </i><br>
<i>&gt;politically unpalatable for the Administration.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;No doubt there will be horse-trading and deal-making galore throughout all </i><br>
<i>&gt;this, but those of us interested in Mars exploration specifically, and </i><br>
<i>&gt;space exploration in general, can't assume the NASA budget will be saved </i><br>
<i>&gt;without our efforts. We must continue to make our voices heard in Congress </i><br>
<i>&gt;and in the White House. They must carry a simple message: no more NASA </i><br>
<i>&gt;cuts.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Those who attended the Mars Society Convention received registration </i><br>
<i>&gt;packets containing a simple, succinct message for their representatives </i><br>
<i>&gt;that urged an end to the cuts and a beginning to a human Mars exploration </i><br>
<i>&gt;program. It read:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Dear Senator/Representative:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Space exploration is vital to America's future. I urge you to maintain </i><br>
<i>&gt;funding for Mars exploration and other space science initiatives in the FY </i><br>
<i>&gt;2000 NASA budget. But simply maintaining funding for our existing robotic </i><br>
<i>&gt;space exploration efforts is not enough. It is time for America to resume </i><br>
<i>&gt;its pioneering tradition by launching an effort to send humans to Mars </i><br>
<i>&gt;within the first decade of the 21st century. Congress should start blazing </i><br>
<i>&gt;the trail now by creating a program to develop the technology needed for </i><br>
<i>&gt;such an endeavor.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;America owes its greatness to its past willingness to embrace the challenge </i><br>
<i>&gt;of new frontiers. We cannot afford to do less. Humans to Mars."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;It is absolutely critical that we make our voices heard now, before debate </i><br>
<i>&gt;on the NASA budget begins, and throughout the negotiations that will soon </i><br>
<i>&gt;start. Write, phone, fax, or meet with your Senators and Representatives </i><br>
<i>&gt;(with Congress in recess, many are in their home districts). Let them know </i><br>
<i>&gt;that the 21st century must mark an end to the nearly decade-long assault on </i><br>
<i>&gt;NASA's budget, and a beginning to a new national commitment to space </i><br>
<i>&gt;exploration and development.</i><br>

<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;++ MARS SOCIETY TO HOLD CONTESTS ++</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;At the Second International Mars Society Convention a series of contests </i><br>
<i>&gt;were announced. These include:</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;* The Goddard Prize: A technical contest for chapters or members to submit </i><br>
<i>&gt;a design for a 10 kilogram payload to be flown to an altitude of 100 </i><br>
<i>&gt;kilometers on a sounding rocket that the US Air Force Academy has made </i><br>
<i>&gt;available to the Mars Society. The payload will not be recovered, so all </i><br>
<i>&gt;data taken must be transmitted by radio. The flight will occur in April </i><br>
<i>&gt;2000. Proposals are due at Mars Society headquarters by November 1. Details </i><br>
<i>&gt;of payload requirements, volume limitations, etc. will be posted on the </i><br>
<i>&gt;Mars Society website at www.marssociety.org as soon as they are provided by </i><br>
<i>&gt;the USAF Academy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;* The Rouget de Lisle Award: A musical contest to develop an anthem and </i><br>
<i>&gt;other songs for the Mars Society. No great social or political movement has </i><br>
<i>&gt;ever succeeded without the power of music helping to move the souls of </i><br>
<i>&gt;those in and around it. So Mars needs music! The best songs will be </i><br>
<i>&gt;included on upcoming Ares CDs. Songs should be submitted on tape cassette </i><br>
<i>&gt;with an accompanying hard copy of the lyrics, and a letter giving the Mars </i><br>
<i>&gt;Society the right to use the song on its CDs. The deadline for submission </i><br>
<i>&gt;to be considered for the 2000 award is March 1, 2000. Songs will be </i><br>
<i>&gt;accepted in any musical style, including classical, folk, jazz, pop, rock, </i><br>
<i>&gt;etc.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Rouget de Lisle was the author of "The Marseilles." There is an anecdote </i><br>
<i>&gt;that upon hearing this stirring anthem sung in the streets of revolutionary </i><br>
<i>&gt;Paris for the first time in 1792, the young Napoleon Bonaparte exclaimed to </i><br>
<i>&gt;its author, "Monsieur, your song is worth a hundred regiments!" If said, </i><br>
<i>&gt;then this remark by France's future military genius could hardly have been </i><br>
<i>&gt;more astute. So sing, Martian muses, sing.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;* The Hakluyt Prize; The Hakluyt prize is given for the best student (age </i><br>
<i>&gt;22 or less) letter sent to world leaders advocating a humans to Mars </i><br>
<i>&gt;program. Both the quality and quantity of the letters count. The winner </i><br>
<i>&gt;will receive an all-expenses paid trip to the Third International Mars </i><br>
<i>&gt;Society Convention to be held in Toronto during August 2000, as well as a </i><br>
<i>&gt;fine Bushnell telescope. The first Hakluyt prize was won by Adrian Hon, of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Liverpool, England, in 1998, and the second one was won by Katie Harris, of </i><br>
<i>&gt;Georgetown, Ontario, in 1999. To be eligible for competition for the 2000 </i><br>
<i>&gt;Hakluyt prize award, copies of letters along with a list of those to whom </i><br>
<i>&gt;they were sent must be received at Mars Society headquarters by May 1, </i><br>
<i>&gt;2000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Hakluyt Prize is named after Richard Hakluyt, the tireless pamphleteer </i><br>
<i>&gt;whose numerous writings convinced the elite of Tudor England to take the </i><br>
<i>&gt;policy decisions required to establish the first British settlements in the </i><br>
<i>&gt;New World.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;++ SOCIETY'S PRESIDENT DUE FOR NINE CITY BOOK TOUR ++</i><br>
