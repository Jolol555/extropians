I ran across something interesting at Kim's Video on St. Mark's Place, NYC
this weekend.  In the Experimental/Noise section there was a section for the
"Meme Label".  In this section were a great many blank, white cd cases.
Nothing on them whatsoever, not even copyright information.  Very curious.
Furthermore, stuck to the outer cellophane wrappings was a little sticker,
scrawled in barely legible script, the name of the artist.  Nothing more.
Most of them were Japanese, it seemed.  Kind of brought me back to the days
following the "Intelligentsia" just to see what they were up to.  

<p>
Anyway, I wasn't brave enough to plop down the 15 for a blank "noise" cd -
which really isn't my style anyway... But for just under 40 I walked out
with cd's by Stereolab, Tortoise, and a Russian import of The Legendary Pink
Dots.  Not a bad day's haul.

Subject: Extropian/Transhuman music... Where?


<p>
Where do I find current examples of transhuman/extropian music. I saw Max M
mentioned... Web site? Any other good examples? I'm especially interested in
stuff I can download.

<p>
I'll be adding my own contribution to this area soon... watch this space.
I'm interested to see what others have done.
