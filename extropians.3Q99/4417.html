I am sitting here watching this part of the world
(Australia/Indonesia) play with disaster. So it is
much on my mind. 
 
<p>
1.) IMHO, there can be an active, deliberate
suspension of  rationality, and a taking-up of
rhetoric.

<p>
<a name="4450qlink1">2.) I'm sorry to say that many people seem  to be in
attracted to violence. Look at the content of our
videos/movies/books/etc. Even if these don't influence
people, what sells says something.</a>

<p>
3.) There is also fear, and fear can be a runaway
process, overtaking the mind. Once people are fearful,
they can be made to agree to almost anything :(.

<p>
4.) Traditional hatreds, ignorance, dogmatism,
stereotyping, "groupthink", identification, etc.

<p>
5.) Economic interest being placed above all else.

<p>
6.) Laziness. Unwillingness to look at alternatives to
violence.

<p>
7.) Reliance on leaders to solve our problems. Wanting
a "strong man" figure.

<p>
8.) Frustration.

<p>
9.) Plain Meanness.
  
<p>
This whole mess is fanned by the would-be leaders.
Anyone who protests may be castigated or intimidated,
and there is, I guess, a whole tangle of memes that
can be activated in the service of violence.

<p>
Maybe the whole human race needs "something useful to
do with its hands". Well there ARE useful things to
do, but many of them are regarded with contempt.

<p>
But there are people who try to do positive things,
one has to remember this. Dwelling on violence can be
destructive itself.

<p>
Feeding/educating people would be a start.

<p>
Sorry if this is depressing !
