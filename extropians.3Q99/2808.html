No.  Please.  Ill do anything you ask.  Not that....  {8^D

Robert, it would be hard to explain to the 90s generation why we
thought it was cool to listen to a song that consisted of the words

<p>
"...shake shake shake.  shake shake shake.
shake your booty.  shake your booty...."

<p>
repeated about 50 times.  There was such a song.  It is amazing we
emerged from that decade with anything more than putrid mush
for brains.

<p>
Heres a blast from the 70s:  [Its just a pointless funny story.  Please dont

<p>
read on if you are busy, as I know many are].  I was in 8th grade and the
English teacher wanted an essay on:  What is our pet peeve about our school.

<p>
Of  course there was the usual 13 yr old tripe: there is no air
conditioning,
<br>
cafeteria food sucks, etc.  I decided to point out the fact that our school
mascot, [we were the Parkway Pirates] suggested antisocial behavior, to
say the least:

<p>
"... So we ask, what *is* a pirate, exactly?  Webster's describes the
term as referring to a maritime predator or criminal, often associated
with plunder, rape, murder, etc.  I propose we drop the swashbuckling
high seas adventure associated with the name Pirates, and change our
mascot name to more accurately describe what we have in mind.
Granted the cheers would perhaps be clumsy:

<p>
Hey Hey Whaddya say!  Lets go take that ball away!
Go Rapist/murder/theives!

<p>
Our crosstown rivals, the barracudas, are also maritime preditors, in a
sense, but these have not the capacity for moral thought.  I am ashamed
to stand under this label "Pirates"...

<p>
etc.  I waxed eloquent, outdoing even my usual grandiose style.  It was
all a joke actually, but the teacher realized, hey the little jerk has a
point here.  He made a bunch of copies and distributed them to the
other teachers, who laughed, then realized, hey the little twit has a
point here.  So.  It came up in committee to consider changing the
mascot.  The situation was resolved by...  closing the school, for you
see, the birth control pill was introduced in the early 60s and the classes
following mine were much smaller, so, the pirates went over and joined
the barracudas.

<p>
The next year I went to Astronaut High School, in Titusville Florida,
where our mascot was... the war eagle.  I had managed to stir the
pot once before with the antisocial mascot thing, so I decided to push
my luck.  At my first class meeting I stood and proposed that we
change our names to... the Astronaut Peace Eagles.  I was lucky to
get out of there alive, and it was *the last* class meeting I attended
at that school.  {8^D

<p>
I warned you that it was a pointless story.  Shake your booty!  spike
