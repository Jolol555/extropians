I agree that we have to aknowledge its existence.
Any intelligent action needs self-knowledge.
If we are aware of such a factor within us we are
better off, we can take it into account and not so
easily be slaves to "hard-wiring" (or cultural
programming).

<p>
I think it's partly our evolutionary heritage, which
then gets mis-used. I think it's ridiculous to accept
evolution and not accept that our brains will bear its
stamp, even though culture and individuals might
modify it.

<p>
I think we would have to be very careful about any
neurological intervention when dealing with such a
complex thing as the mind/brain. 

<p>
*Maybe* harmless catharsis might be better?
