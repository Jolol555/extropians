Hi, guys and gals.  Been away for a while.  Just caught this thread.  Havn't 
read all the more recent continuings of this thread, but just want to throw 
in my 2 cents (bibliographically/hypertextually speaking) by mentioning that 
the late great philosopher David L. Norton, in his magnificent treatise 
<br>
*Personal Destinies: A Philosophy of Ethical Individualism*,  says much the <br>
same thing.  Let *businesses* (probably but not necessarily corporations) be 
responsible for education, let them sponsor and mentor and educate future 
scientists, engineers, even philosophers and other "liberal arts" 
types---and **surely** let them handle elementary and secondary 
education---they'd almost undoubtedly do a better job of it than is 
currently being done by Der Stat.

<p>
Best regards to all!

<p>
