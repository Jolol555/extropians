&gt;&gt;&gt; Make sure you do this on the list and not
&gt;&gt;&gt; through email, as extropians have been known to
&gt;&gt;&gt; take credit for ideas they got from someone else
&gt;&gt;&gt; through email. At a recent extropy conference a
&gt;&gt;&gt; whole talk by their "leader" was apparantly
&gt;&gt;&gt; based on an idea taken from someone else's email.
&gt;&gt;&gt; There may have been some original ideas in the
&gt;&gt;&gt; talk as well. I don't know. But transhumanists
&gt;&gt;&gt; should not tolerate this kind of behavior. It
&gt;&gt;&gt; gives us a bad name.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Libertarians seem to be so liberated they can
&gt;&gt;&gt; liberate others of their ideas.......
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; And a little more uprightness would help
&gt;&gt;&gt; the transhumanist movement.
&gt;&gt;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; Sorry it had to be said.

<a href="3574.html#3581qlink2">&gt; What a complete crock of crap!  I think I know</a><br>
<i>&gt; what this person is utterly misinterpreting.  It</i><br>
<i>&gt; so happened that someone posted a comment about</i><br>
<i>&gt; use of the word "posthuman" and "transhumanism"</i><br>
<i>&gt; on the extropians list the afternoon before</i><br>
<i>&gt; EXTRO4.  (It was actually a pretty interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt; post, if I recall correctly.)  I barely saw it</i><br>
<i>&gt; by checking my email from my hotel room with my</i><br>
<i>&gt; notebook, but I know Max didn't see it because</i><br>
<i>&gt; he was flying up from LA when it was posted and</i><br>
<i>&gt; didn't have the time to check email during the</i><br>
<i>&gt; conference. Max's talk, in part, addressed some</i><br>
<i>&gt; of the same points, but in a very different way,</i><br>
<i>&gt; and also addressed other issues.  As if this</i><br>
<i>&gt; person (whoever it is) thinks that Max's talk</i><br>
<i>&gt; was based on an email on the ExList posted a few</i><br>
<i>&gt; hours before he gave the talk!  What utter</i><br>
<i>&gt; nonsense!</i><br>

<p>
Greg,

<p>
<a name="3584qlink1">That person who made the "post-human" posts was me, and now I
feel horrible if my comments about "having discussed these
issues through email in the past" with Max and other
transhumanists -- and perhaps also the timing of my post? -- led
Samuel to conclude that any similarity between my post(s) and
Max's talk resulted from Max's having "liberated" the ideas from
me.</a> Not true at all. My emails with Max were quite brief and
merely gestured towards the ideas in my recent post. (I did use
the term "ultra-humanism" in an email to Max last year, which he
says -- and I 100% believe him -- he simply forgot. I think I'm
a few months older than Max so I'll chalk it up to "anxiety of
influence." Kidding.) I probably shouldn't have mentioned the
previous emails in my post but I wanted to refresh the memories
of the interesting interlocutors, including Max, I spoke with on
these issues, and perhaps draw them back into the discussion.

<p>
In sum: any conclusion about the lack of originality of Max's
talk that is based on my post is entirely unwarranted; and I
regret anything I (or my friend and colleague, Stan, who joined
the List around that time) might have written to lead someone
down this particular delusion path. I don't doubt that Max's
talk was not only highly original, but highly stimulating as
well. I regret that I had to miss it.

<p>
Best,
<br>
Brian.
