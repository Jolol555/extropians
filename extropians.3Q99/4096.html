Once again, I would like to put in a plug for all of those intrepid humans who are indeed breaking out of the male/female dichotomy right now, during their current lives as humans.  This isn't something that we have to sit around and wait to do, you can implement it in your own life right now!  The future of gender is happening right now, all around us, as people relinquish their male/female identities and move into other combinations.  Many are experimenting with various forms of androgyny, my own preferred identity.  Others are trying out different forms of being male or female.  I wouldn't put down anyone who wants to try the more traditional drag, because I think there is a lot to be learned there as well.  Male drag queens, more than anyone, have deconstructed the artificiality of the female archetypes that society holds to.
