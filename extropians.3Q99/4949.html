Hello everyone,

<p>
I felt I had to comment on the response QueenMUSE made regarding what E. 
Shaun had said about wanting a nanotech city that was not only beautiful but 
also economically productive.  My response taken from history and present 
pop culture is found below!

Sounds like a place I would love to visit(then again, I have not even made 
it to Paris yet!).  But we must not forget the lessons of history(as taught 
by Old Testament prophets!).  While the inhabitants of this city make merry 
in their degenerate state they will be conquered by fierce and spartan 
barbarians!!  Just as Babylon fell to the Medes and Persians so it would be 
for them!  Of course the barbarians will have to be masters of an equal to 
superior form of nanotech and A.I. to have any chance of being victorious!!

<a name="4981qlink1"><a name="4980qlink1">And the invaders may in no time become utterly seduced by the enticements of 
a nanotech pleasure city.  In history the conqueror would often be conquered 
by the culture they had defeated militarily.</a></a>
Though with nanotech the invader could destroy easily or simply restructure 
the entire city!<a name="4951qlink1">  A former utopian delight could be remade into any form</a> of 
hell where the conquerors could watch with glee as the former owners were 
forced to live as medieval serfs or denizens of Dante's hell.  Of course you 
might jack into their brains to do this but for spectacle my way might be 
much better!

<p>
<a name="4981qlink2"><a name="4980qlink2">I realize Muse that you were making the point that not every city should 
HAVE to be economically productive but ironically this city would be a 
fantastic tourist attraction!!  If it were attacked it would probably be by 
the jealous combined forces of the Disney and Universal Studios Alliance!  I 
can just imagine air cavalry units composed of troops mounted on flying 
Dumbo's and great white sharks!  Scary!!</a></a>

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
