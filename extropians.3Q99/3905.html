It may be stretching the point a bit, but part of the panel discussion
focused on how the ravages of AIDS radically altered standards of beauty
among gay men.  Previous to the start of the epidemic, only a small
percentage of gay men pursued the buff 'gym bunny' look, and it was a sort
of fetishistic preference.  As the epidemic began to ravage the community,
it became more important for men to look healthy and HIV-negative,
otherwise they could be rejected as a mate and maybe even face social
ostracism.  Nowadays, the gym bunny look is almost exclusively associated
with gay men, to the extent that very muscular straight men can be mistaken
for being gay.
