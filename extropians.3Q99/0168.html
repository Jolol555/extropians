&lt;&lt; 0. If I can replace the emotion FEAR with a "WARNING: DANGER" function 
which
<p>
    works as fast (=at a low level) as FEAR does, then I would replace it.  I
    regard any person irresponsible who simply removes FEAR without replacing
    it with some other safeguard.

<a name="0241qlink1">I really don't know how necessary a warning would be at this point in my 
life, I would rather be clear on how to handle the situation rather than have 
to sort through fear in a split second decision.  For example I really don't 
think I would need a warning to tell me not to jump off a building.  I feel 
somewhat self assured that somewhere in my mind I would be able to say to 
myself "Jumping off this building could be counter productive."  So I have 
very little reservations in loosing fear.  I would be more worried about 
loosing the adrenaline that comes with fear.</a>
