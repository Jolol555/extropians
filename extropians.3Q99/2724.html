<i>&gt;were "outsiders" as children, e.g. played mostly alone,</i><br>
<i>&gt;had only a few friends, or were generally rejected by</i><br>
<i>&gt;the social cliques that educational system produces?</i><br>

<a name="2746qlink1">Actually, I was the life of the party as a kid, to the point that I 
transcended it.  I was literally the most popular kid in my class in most of 
elementary and high school, voted "class king" in high school, etc., etc.  
When it goes that well but you're also raised to be super-critical, then at 
some point you begin to see how thin the facade</a> is.  I could see that with 
all I had going for me, there was no limit socially, but I didn't want it, 
because the one thing I was starving for was the truth.

<p>
I consciously rejected social success and made a conscious, explicit 
decision to be an outsider.  I figured that the only way to see the truth 
was to put yourself in a position that appeared - or really was - vulnerable 
to attack.  Then you find out who the real good people are.  (Also the real 
bad ones.)

<p>
I had the advantage of being caught up early on in multiple levels of 
social/psychological conflict as a displaced yankee kid in the deep South.  
I literally had to fight every single day in first grade against little 
rebels out to defend the honor of the South, and as I was finally accepted 
because I didn't quit and I started winning all the fights, and then 
excelled at virtually everything I tried, I never forgot that year, or all 
the levels of hypocrisy and prejudice pervading that milleau, and I've 
always watched other people since then to see how they behave toward other 
people who are weak and vulnerable, because it's only when they're free to 
act without apparent personal consequences that you see their real 
preferences.
