NOT!

NO NO NO.  Nobody ever said that anti-matter travels back in time!!!
What they said was that it *looks* that way from the perspective
of some of its reactions with other particles.  Looking and doing
are two completely different things.  Your image in a mirror
looks like a mirror-image of you, that doesn't mean that a
mirror image of you actually exists!

<p>

<a href="2537.html#2546qlink4">&gt; in time wouldn't we never see it except for perhaps, maybe, a second?</a><br>

<p>
There is no evidence for things that "travel backwards in time"
and there is theoretical work that says it is impossible.

<p>
Lord lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil
(i.e. misinterpretations that result in endless messages
about stuff that is pure fantasy...)

<p>
Real physics can quite magical enough (witness nanotechnology,
SI computers, etc.) without going off into the fantasy physics realm.

<p>
Greg, if you happed to read this message, I think your lemurs
could teach some of the people here a thing or two.
