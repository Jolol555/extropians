Actually, Maine was Massachusetts till after the Rev. War, and Vermont
was part of NH as well. Ethan and Ira Allen led the rebellious townships
to found Vermont in Windsor. So it was more a matter of engineering your
own stock split.. ;) Half of Coos County in norther NH was an
independent country for quite a while (Republic of Indian Stream) after
the war, and NH went to war against Maine once after the war in a
dispute over the border location.

<p>
Now, Aristook (not sure of the spelling) County, which is about one
third of Maine, is almost the size of NH, yet has less than 30,000
population as I recall. People just refer to it as 'The County", and its
residents are considered to be more gap-toothed than the typical Mainer.
