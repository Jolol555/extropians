Anybody see those new Sprite commercials which combine hip hop and Japanese
imagery, with a little Hong Kong movie style thrown in?  I think they're
very striking, and very modern.  They take two very sophisticated,
technologically advanced cultures that are extremely disparate and combine
them in an interesting way.

<p>
I see more and more of this kind of internationalization of American popular
culture.  Some of it is strikingly successful (there was a wonderful MTV ad
recently that used Indian imagery) and some of it seems very forced (Madonna
as a geisha?)

<p>
If those Sprite ads had aired ten years ago, the audience might not have
understood what they were seeing.  But today's audiences are more culturally
literate - the kids in Iowa who watch MTV probably have at least a glancing
familiarity with Anime, Jackie Chan and Tupac Shakur that makes the
synthesis more comprehensible to them.
