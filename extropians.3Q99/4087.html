Friends,

<p>
<a name="4128qlink1">    Science advances at a blistering pace, a vast global flood welling up,
droplet by unnoticed droplet, from laboratories across the planet.   In the
mass media, the news is sparse, being of little infotainment value.</a>
<p>
     Gina Miller, posing as that mild-mannered reporter for the obsure
cyberspacial mailing list "extropians", and assembling techno-newsworthy
tidbits under the psuedonymous byline "Nanogirl", offers the excerpt shown
at the end of this post. 

<p>
However, embedded therein, easily lost amid the techno-ese is the following
comment:

<p>
<a href="4036.html#4087qlink1">&gt;the fact ...&lt;snip&gt;... suggests that "...ex vivo</a><br>
<i>&gt;expansion of transplantable human stem cells under this in vitro culture</i><br>
system is a general
<br>
<i>&gt;phenomenon..."</i><br>

<p>
     Once more:  "...expansion of... human stem cells in... culture is a
general phenomenon..."

<p>
Stem cells--the full range of stem cells-- are something of a biotech holy
grail.  To fully exploit their potential will require the ability to
proliferate them in culture while retaining their polymorphic nature.  The
above suggests a major step in that direction, with application to tissue
and organ regeneration, longevity, rejuvenation, and post-cryo repair.

*Culture system expands human hematopoietic stem cells
WESTPORT, Sep 10 (Reuters Health) - Using a stromal-based in vitro culture
expansion
<br>
system that they developed, US scientists report the successful long-term
ex vivo maintenance
<br>
and expansion of human hematopoietic stem cells suitable for
transplantation. Dr. Chu-Chih Shih
<br>
from the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, California, and
colleagues there and
<br>
at Amgen Inc., in Thousand Oaks, describe their achievement in the
September 1st issue of the
<br>
journal Blood. The researchers cultured CD34+ thy-1+ cells on an
established monolayer of
<br>
murine stromal cells, AC6.21, with leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF),
interleukin-3 (IL-3), IL-6,
<br>
granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor and other cytokines. This
produced a
<br>
"...150-fold expansion of cells retaining the CD34+ thy-1+ phenotype" after
5 weeks of
<br>
culturing. These cells were capable of differentiating into "...myeloid, T
and B cells, when
<br>
transplanted into [severe combined immunodeficient-human] SCID-hu mice,"
according to Dr.
<br>
Shih's group. Dr. Shih and colleagues say the fact that another
hematopoietic stem cell
<br>
candidate, CD34+ CD38- cells, proliferate in a similar manner suggests that
"...ex vivo
<br>
expansion of transplantable human stem cells under this in vitro culture
system is a general
<br>
phenomenon and not just specific for CD34+ thy-1+ cells." Dr. Shih's group
hopes the culture
<br>
system will provide a valuable tool for identifying the factors involved in
"...regulating the
<br>
process of self-renewal, proliferation, and differentiation in early
hematopoietic development
<br>
and will have important implications for ex vivo stem cell expansion, gene
therapy and
<br>
therapeutic transplantation." Blood 1999;94:1623-1636.
