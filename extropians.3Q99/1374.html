<a href="1271.html#1374qlink1">&gt; Why should SI's see turning humans into uploads as competition in any sense</a><br>
<i>&gt; that harms them? It would just mean more persons with whom to have</i><br>
<i>&gt; productive exchanges.</i><br>

<p>
When a certain level of personal power is reached, the costs of
competition start to outweigh the benefits. This I belief will be
the case with true SI (see below).
 
<p>
<a href="1271.html#1374qlink2">&gt; &gt;Total control is even better. The SI wouldn't rest before it had </a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;brought "everything" under its control, or die trying. Logical, don't </i><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;you think? </i><br>
<i>&gt; </i><br>
<a name="1382qlink1"><i>&gt; This must be where we differ. No, I don't think total control is desirable</i><br>
<i>&gt; or beneficial, even if it were me who had that total control. If true</i><br>
<i>&gt; omnipotence were possible, maybe what you are saying would follow, but</i><br>
<i>&gt; omnipotence is a fantasy to be reserved for religions. Even superpowerful</i><br>
<i>&gt; and ultraintelligent beings should benefit from cooperation and exchange.</i><br>

<p>
I find it extremely hard to imagine how something which can expand
and modify its mind and body at will could ever need peers to
cooperate with. If a SI can't entertain itself it isn't a real SI, and
when it runs into some obstacle it can simply manufacture more
computing modules, and/or experiment with new thought structures.</a>

<p>
<a name="1382qlink2">I think it's fair to assume that a SI would be essentially immortal,
so there's no need to hurry.</a> Even if there's such a thing as the end 
<a name="1382qlink3">of the universe, it would still have billions of years to find a solution,
which is ample time for even a human-level intelligence. Needless
(or perhaps not) to say, a SI would never be "lonely" because a)
it could and no doubt would drop our evolution-imposed urge for
company, it having outlived its usefulness, and b) it could
simply spawn another mind child, or otherwise fool around with 
its consciousness, taking as much (or little) risk as it wanted
should it ever feel like</a> it.

<p>
The above pushes the value of peers into the "0" zone, i.e.
makes it neutral. But it doesn't stop there...

<p>
Other SIs could have completely different goals, goals which
might include harm to, or even the destruction of, the original
SI. Also their very existence would mean that there would be
less resources for everyone (assuming resources wouldn't
be unlimited), which could at some point seriously limit the
SI's development.

<p>
Now the value of peers has become negative (say, -1).
Rational entities always seek a positive value (1 -- let's
call it "eternal bliss"), so obviously they'll try to limit
the number of (potential) competititors.

<p>
The SI doesn't really have to be "omnipotent" to be fully 
autonomous; simply being "very powerful" (with features
such as mentioned above) will suffice. Cooperation (in
the form of societies, economies etc.) is by definition 
something for the weak and limited, like us humans for
example.
 
<p>
<a name="1382qlink4"><a href="1271.html#1374qlink3">&gt; Despite my disagreement with your zero-sum assumptions (if I'm getting your</a><br>
<i>&gt; views right--I only just starting reading this thread and you may simply be</i><br>
<i>&gt; running with someone else's assumptions for the sake of the argument), I</i><br>
<i>&gt; agree with this. While uploads and SI's may not have any inevitable desire</i><br>
<i>&gt; to wipe us out, some might well want to, and I agree that it makes sense to</i><br>
<i>&gt; deal with that from a position of strength.</i><br>

<p>
Exactly, just to be on the safe side we should only start experimenting
with strong AI after having reached a trans/posthuman status ourselves.
 If you're going to play God, better have His power. Even
if I'm completely wrong about rational motivations, there could be
a billion other reasons why a SI would want to harm humans.

<p>
<a name="1382qlink5"><a href="1271.html#1374qlink4">&gt; I'm not sure how much we can influence the relative pace of research into</a><br>
<i>&gt; unfettered independent SIs vs. augmentation of human intelligence, but I</i><br>

<p>
We won't know until we try. Nothing to lose, so why not? It's
*definitely not* a waste of time, like Eliezer (who has a 
different agenda anyway) would like us to belief.</a>

<p>
<a name="1382qlink6"><a href="1271.html#1374qlink5">&gt; too favor the latter. Unlike Hans Moravec and (if I've read him right,</a><br>
<i>&gt; Eliezer), I have no interest in being superceded by something better. I</i><br>
<i>&gt; want to *become* something better.</i><br>

<p>
I saw an interview with Moravec the other day in some Discovery
Channel program about (surprise, surprise) robots. He seemed
to be, yet again, sincere in his belief that it's somehow right
that AIs will replace us, that the future belongs to them and 
not to us. He apparently finds comfort in the idea that they'll
remember us as their "parents", an idea shared by many
AI researchers, afaik. Well, personally I couldn't care less
about offspring, artificial or biological; I want to experience
the future myself.
