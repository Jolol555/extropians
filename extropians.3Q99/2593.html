<a name="2602qlink1"><i>&gt; [hal@finney.org] ...guesses if</i><br>
<a href="2583.html#2593qlink1">&gt; your lasers were outputting continuous energy then you'd actually create</a><br>

Hmmm, I dont think this is right Hal.  Im not sure, but I do recall an
experiment I did years ago in a physics lab.<a name="2623qlink1">  I had two lasers.  I
wondered how the two beams would effect each other.  Would they
interact like two streams from water hoses?  I had two lasers intersect
and watched the targets.  The one beam didnt seem to know or
</a>
care that it had passed thru another beam.  I never could make the
</a>
two beams mess each other up.  spike
