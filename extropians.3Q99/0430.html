Yep, I was reading an article a few weeks ago about all the wonderful new
bugs introduced by people using C++ classes without knowing what they
actually did; users were finding all kinds of unprogrammed 'features' in
applications which had been built into those classes for some other reason
and still worked, often breaking the application in the process. The author
also compared a C program he'd written which compiled to around 30k to a
one megabyte C++ program he'd downloaded from the Net which did exactly the
same job; disassembling it showed around 40k of code which actually did 
anything useful, the rest of the program was just unwanted crap from the 
C++ classes the programmer had used.

But hey, it's only RAM, disk space and support calls, so who cares?
