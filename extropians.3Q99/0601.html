<a href="0597.html#0601qlink1"> &gt; Up till this I had been in two minds about whether to go for head-only</a><br>
<i> &gt; or full-body suspension. It now seems that full-body is the better</i><br>
<i> &gt; option, warranting the extra cost. Thanks.</i><br>

<p>
Due to prolonged process of dying prior to suspension in essentially
every patient the periphery (due to body's built-in protection mechanisms) 
gets very limited blood flow for days -- it thus 1) suffers extensive 
damage 2) thus gets very very patchy cryoprotectant perfusion. While the 
most recent best-case(!) ischaemic (rabbit) models seem to imply even 
neuros are getting a very rough ride, this need not to remain so in
the future (if cryonics is part of euthanasia in ICU setting). 
Single-organ vs. multi-organ cryoprotection is intrinsically much 
simpler to achieve. (Though I am not sure of this) neuros achieve
faster and better perfusion by clamping off the rest of the body.
Additional (admittedly minor) point with whole-body: cracking. 
Financial reason: neuros are cheaper, since whole-bodys don't 
utilize dewar volume well.

<p>
Since the technology necessary for suspension can essentially generate 
a body or a model thereof which is essentially undistinguishable
from the real thing, whole-body basically doesn't make sense. Ymmv.
