My experience tracks Anders': the experiment of writing in E-prime taught me 
some things about language and helped me tighten up some of my prose. Having 
done the exercise, I didn't feel any need to keep doing it all the time. I 
notice all the "IS THIS" and "IS THAT" in people's speech and writing when 
they express strong opinions now, and it appears to me that the discipline of 
E' might allow them to reconsider some of their naked assertions.

<p>
"Is not!" "Is too!" -- timeless children's argument.

<p>
I remember hearing a radio interview a few years ago with someone who had 
taught himself to speak E' fluently. He sounded slightly pedantic but very 
clear. For all I know, he sounded pendantic and unclear before :-)

<p>
I notice that when I write about E' or g.s. topics, I tend to lapse into E'. 

<p>
Many of the basic ideas of g.s. show up in introductions to communication 
nowadays, and taken out of their cloak of Korzybskian jargon, sound like 
simple propositions that we should have known all along. Example: each 
sapient has accumulated knowledge and prejudices that act to filter what s/he 
hears and thinks. A unit of meaning (meaning(A)) bubbles up through all the 
layers of Alice's mind, gets encoded into message(A) according to her thought 
and speech patterns, sent out over a potentially noisy medium, perceived by 
Bob's sight or hearing, filtered through similar layers in his mind, decoded 
into message(B), and finally interpreted into meaning(B). The communication  
succeeds in proportion to the extent that meaning(B) resembles meaning(A).
