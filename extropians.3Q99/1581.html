salt solution into a sludge (=water ice crystals in unfrozen

supercooling a liquid until it turns into a (meta)stable glass is
called vitrification, btw).

<p>
Neither occurs with freeze-hardy higher animals. They all die if
cooled deep enough for the residual liquid to freeze. Suda's
experiment won't work if you try it with liquid nitrogen.

That's how it appears superficially. ~260 K is not cold enough by far
for that. Try dry ice or nitrogen, and then rewarm the fish. Surprise!

<p>
All this has very little to do with the internal state of the
organism. I may freeze an animal heart "rock solid" by briefly
submerging it into liquid nitrogen. It will even resume beating if
rewarmed. Unfortunately, "rock solid" only refers to the outer shell.

<p>
Cryobiology might be incomplete, but it is not *that* incomplete.
