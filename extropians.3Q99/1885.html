Yep, because we don't understand the processes (yet) in all cases.
However, we do the crystal structure of Glucose 6-phosphate
dehydrogenase just one time.  Once we have it there is no point
to doing it anymore.  [We might experiment with it to see
if we can improve it, but we *don't* repeat knowledge
acquisition processes once we complete them (unless we
forget them)].

Because the capacity an SI (a trillion trillion+ times
greater than our own) is so large and they are probably
so old (billions of years) that they have been there
and done that for most things.  The probability is much
greater that we are an experiment.

<p>
Only if we are unique or new in some respect.  You have
to make an argument that we represent something they
haven't seen before.   You also have to make an argument
that we are more interesting to them than the dustballs
in your house are to you.  Yes, you can study dustballs
and there are even a few people that do.  Most of us
however either pay no attention to them or simply get
out the vacuum when they happen to register at a
conscious level. :-)
