<a name="1409qlink1"><a href="1390.html#1400qlink1">&gt;Does the cryonics/extropians movement even really need his money?  Is the</a><br>
<i>&gt;movement basically self-sufficient at this point?  What would be on a</i><br>
<i>&gt;cryonics leader's "wish-list" that Robert Bigelow could provide??  Research</i><br>
<i>&gt;dollars are the first thing that come to mind and debt payment the second.</i><br>
<i>&gt;But then which cryonics firm would he ally with or would he help all the</i><br>
<i>&gt;major ones out?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;With his interest and financial power just think what could be</i><br>

I often hear the exclamation "oh why isn't there a generous texan oil 
billionaire that could give us some money". I don't think that is a viable 
strategy to develop any technology or good. The billionaire simply provides 
to little money. What cryonics needs is to get commercialy viable, then it 
can use the full advantage of a market economy. Unfortunately,</a> cryonics 
companies have to get a lot more professional in their marketing and 
customer service, and they have to  show clearer product value (I think they 
still are relying too much on "nanotech Santa Claus"). Then they will 
receive the capital to expand. Depending on good hearted patrons is not a 
good alternative.
