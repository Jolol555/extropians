<a href="1683.html#1702qlink1">&gt;Do any of you know how to contact Neal Stephenson?  I</a><br>
<i>&gt;found 18 typos in Cryptonomicon, which he might like to</i><br>
<i>&gt;fix before it goes to paperback.  Have you found any others?</i><br>
<i>&gt;We could submit them all together as the extropians</i><br>
<i>&gt;contribution to a truly great book.  spike</i><br>


<p>
<a name="1727qlink1">Try <a href="http://www.cryptonomicon.com/">http://www.cryptonomicon.com/</a> .  There's an "inquiries may be forwarded to" email
for his publisher.  He also put a "Frequently Anticipated Questions" document on the
web about the book; it's at <a href="http://www.well.com/user/neal/cypherFAQ.html">http://www.well.com/user/neal/cypherFAQ.html</a> .  It lists
his email as neal@well.com, but with this warning:

One of the peculiarities of being a novelist is that there is an irremediable
numerical imbalance between outgoing and
incoming bandwidth. In other words, a novelist writes a single document and sends it
out into the world, which is a fairly
<br>
low-bandwidth procedure. But if the novel is read by many people who try to send
communications back the other way, the
<br>
novelist is quickly overwhelmed and becomes unable to function. There is nothing that
can be done about this imbalance,
<br>
and so I apologize in advance if I do not respond to incoming e-mails. I will not
take offense if e-mail is sent to me, but in
return I ask that you not take offense if I fail to answer.

<p>
Finally, I imagine he is already well aware of the typos.  The book has been out for
a while and most people take great pleasure in informing authors and editors of
errata.
