Actualy, yes, that is exactly what I mean.  It's a only rough approximation,
of course - since you don't seem to believe it, I'll get a more detailed
computation.

  <li>  People get hit by single X rays all the time and survive - energy density
is the major determinant of the probability that you will actually get one
of those unlucky hits.  Rendering a sentient race extinct requires you to
approach 100% mortality, which means you need a very high probability, which
in turn means you need a significant amount of energy.

  <li>  What on Earth makes you think it is realistic to expect cancer to be a
significant problem for a spacefaring civilization?  Do you seriously think
that we could spend another thousand years researching the problem without
finding reliable cures?  With sublight space travel, that is the kind of
timespan we need to be thinking about.

OK - but it will have to wait until after Extro.  I'll post the URL when I
get the web page up.
