<a name="0893qlink1">I can agree with you on the grounds that within our current resource constraints,
we have to more prudent in prioritizing what we spend our money on, and
the 'Face on Mars' may certainly not fall into that category.  What I object to is the
unfair categorization you have thrown on Mac Tonnies.  Calling him a 'crackpot'
IMHO crossed the line from civility to bullying.  As extropians I expect that we
can make the most sincere attempts to resist such temptations despite our
all too human urges to the contrary.</a>
