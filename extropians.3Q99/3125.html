<p>
Remember the young woman I told you about who's a Unitarian?
Well it turns out that she's a writer and is becoming very interested in
Extropianism / Transhumanism.

<p>
She would like to write an article about the society and would like to
interview some of you.  She asked to interview me but I told her I'm new to
the group and was't the best person to quote from.

<p>
Are there any Extropians here who can represent the group and wouldn't mind
being interviewed?  I understand most of you don't live in Denver so it
would have to be done via email.  If you are interested please send me an
email at clintodell@visto.com and I'll pass your address on to her.  Please
don't reply to the return address as I get well over 200 emails a day
already.

<p>
Thanks

<p>
Also she asked about the history and founder of the organization.
I printed out the Extropy Institute Mission Statement, the Extropian
Principles, and the Extro 4 Conference information that is on-line.
Are there any more on-line information that I should give her / or perhaps
read about myself?
