&gt; &gt; I think that someone who holds extropian 
<br>
<a href="3226.html#3237qlink1">&gt;  &gt; values and ideals should by and large take the stance that people who </a><br>
</pre>
<i>&gt;  &gt; propose </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; a statist solution to a social problem have the burden of showing how </i><br>
that 
<br>
<a href="3226.html#3237qlink2">&gt;  &gt; proposed solution doesn't do more harm than good by restricting the </a><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; freedom </i><br>
<i>&gt;  &gt; of individuals to carry on their lives as they choose.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  Agreed with a footnote.  We have to face the reality of *how* to move</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from the existing "statist" solution where the benefits &amp; costs have</i><br>
<i>&gt;  complex evolutionary histories, to one where "states" strongly</i><br>
<i>&gt;  view their "mission statement" as one of minimal intervention.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  Change invokes the threat of survival and while the anarchists</i><br>
<i>&gt;  would like to do it tomorrow, I charge that *realistically* that</i><br>
<i>&gt;  will not happen (unless we can open a new frontier), so the</i><br>
<i>&gt;  requirement, if we are to avoid fantasies, is how to move step-by-step</i><br>
<i>&gt;  from the current reality *to* the "ideal" situation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;  </i><br>
<i>&gt;  My perspective, is that if the environment is depromoting</i><br>
<i>&gt;  rational thought the best situation may be to use the weapons</i><br>
<i>&gt;  of the environment against itself.  The threat of school competition</i><br>
<i>&gt;  might motivate the teachers to rise up against pin-headed school</i><br>
<i>&gt;  boards.  This is not a theoretical argument, it *is* a reality based</i><br>
<i>&gt;  argument.</i><br>

<p>
I agree with this 100%, which was the point of my post some time ago about 
the relationship between libertarian political IDEALS and minarchist 
political POLICIES.  I think it's not particularly extropic to recite one's 
libertarian political ideals in a hard-headed way every time a practical 
current problem presents itself and then dissent from any proposal that makes 
the current situation more rational or more free, even though it uses the 
mechanism of some state power to do so.  People with strong and clear ideals 
rightly fear compromise and the "slippery slope", but not being willing to 
EVER compromise despite that fear is often actually a sign of weakness, in my 
opinion.

<p>
Now, I recognize that one can articulate a consistent libertarian ideology 
that dictates that ANY compromise is "wrong" in the sense that the tool of 
state power is so utterly corrupt and corrupting that NO incremental 
improvement is possible in ANY particular situation.  However, I'm very 
suspicious of this particular brand of very radical libertarian ideology for 
a number of reasons.  First, it has the same kind of hermetically-sealed 
intellectual operation that any all-encompassing philosophical system 
threatens: There's an answer for everything and it offers a simple way of 
avoiding a lot of dialogue that could conceivably challenge the basic 
principles upon which it is based.  In that way, it's a lot like 
fundamentalist religious faith.

<p>
Second, such an "ideologically pure" libertarianism is inherently 
"revolutionary" in the historical sense.  While embracing an ideology that 
calls for pulling down much of the existing social order offers a kind of 
personal satisfaction from basking in the warmth from imagined apocalyptic 
fires, history teaches us that plans for a complete and sudden remaking of 
the social order usually involve (1) violence and (2) don't work for the 
simple reason that social orders ARE complex ecologies: Massive, sudden 
disruptions usually cause disequilibrium that no ideology can restore, no 
matter how well-thought-out.

<p>
Finally, there's a pragmatic reason to reject "libertarian ideological 
purity": Insisting on precise and complete adherence to any set of principles 
will marginalize those who embrace them in the real world of practical social 
action.  The recent history of the two main political parties in the United 
States should be a clear lesson of what happens when ideology is allowed to 
govern too completely over compromise and common sense.

<p>
<a href="3226.html#3237qlink3">&gt;  A key aspect of the discussion, as discussed in the Tough Questions</a><br>
<i>&gt;  thread and commented on by Hal in his eloquent comment regarding</i><br>
<i>&gt;  parents as "caretakers", is the issue of "freedom of individuals"</i><br>
<i>&gt;  and the problem that there are many individuals, who simply refuse</i><br>
<i>&gt;  to treat others (especially children) *as* individuals.</i><br>

<p>
I think the "Tough Questions" thread is exactly the kind of discussion this 
group was originally formed to address.  Lee Crocker is my personal hero of 
the moment for taking the responsibility to diplomatically and wisely set out 
what he sees as hard problems that arise from embracing extropian values and 
ideals: It's an act of intellectual courage to honestly state that your world 
view doesn't simply and completely and immediately offer a satisfactory 
response to each and every issue that arises.  Having taken the time to draft 
this post, I probably can't get into that discussion until later, but I've 
scanned the discussion there and see some high quality thinking -- makes me 
proud to be a part of this number! (As Jim Morrison said . . .)
