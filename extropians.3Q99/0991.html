Definitely not.  I've now had enough time to try doses from 1-7 caps
and under various conditions.  Each person is going to have their
own response curve  I'm relatively lightweight, and 3-4 at night
is ideal.  My wife finds that 5 is her optimal dose.  Before exercise
2-3 seems perfect.  The more intense my workout the more I take.

When I took 6 capsules during the day, the effect is quite profound
in the degree of well-being experienced.  I felt a little
dizzy so I would recommend that you stay home and enjoy the
experience if you try that amount.

<a name="0998qlink1">As for cost, I would definitely look around.  Some friends and I
just went in on a case, which brought the price down to $42/bottle.
I just received it yesterday.  You can order from them at
