 I, of course, do *not* stand outside that picture) is a rational
 explanation for mankind's inclination to create art. &gt;&gt;

<p>
E-shaun - first of all Extropic Artist Natasha Vita More has been here since 
you arrived DAY ONE, and I think her  lectures &amp; posts  give a candid look at 
motive for creativity that is quite rational.Get a copy of her latest book 
and read it.

<p>
 Where've you been, we've been rehashing this for two years or more.

<p>
 Then.... read some De Bono.. or that unpronouncable guy who wrote the book 
called "Flow"... Mycksyly Cznertkywsjhally or whatever it is... There's a ton 
of literature out there on the subject (N,  send him a book list)

<a name="4942qlink1"> Second, MY OPINION: most artists dont need a rational to do art.</a> THey really 
<a name="4942qlink2">don;t give a rat's ass what you think or why they do it, they juast work 
pedal to the medal.
<br>
you know, like the Nike ads: JUST DO IT!
Personally:
<br>
I am not one of those people who thinks art SHOULD be rational, in fact I 
find it a respite from that odious adjective, but if you want it to be 
rational, then have at it. 
<br>
<a name="4840qlink1">Ayn Rand made a total bozo out of herself trying to do just that.
Now, quit flogging a dead horse and get to work -- writing a poem or 
something.
