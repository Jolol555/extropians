Hi!

<i>&gt;violence.  Neighbors, family, or as the last resort, the government</i><br>
<i>&gt;should remove children from abusive parents.</i><br>

<i>&gt;If parents wish to teach their children to hate their fellow humans,</i><br>

<i>&gt;can retain the right to defend himself from satanists and nazis, I</i><br>
<i>&gt;don't have a problem with parents doing such silly stuff.  </i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Besides, humans are very resilient and when the children of satanists</i><br>
<i>&gt;or nazis enter into the real world, they will probably quickly realize</i><br>
<i>&gt;that their belief systems hinder their interactions with others.  They</i><br>
<i>&gt;will either change their belief systems (a lot of us Extropians used to</i><br>
<i>&gt;be socialist christians - I was), or they will spend the rest of their</i><br>

<a name="3141qlink1">The reason why you don't want children educated with violent principles is
because they pose a threat to your survival. Sure you carry a rifle to
work, but that's the American/NRA concept. I disagree because I don't want
to live with the fear of being shot. Unless you are violent and desire
conflict, a peaceful co-existence with other humans is always preferable.
If we can make the men and women of tomorrow more peaceful, we should try
and do so even at the expense of privacy. Avoiding child abuse is one way
of achieving this; providing a good education is another. In addition, I
concluded long ago that privacy and freedom are incompatible with some
technologies we defend.

<p>
Your way of thinking reminds me of Neville Chamberlain and the millions of
persons that died in WWII.</a> 

<p>
<a href="3094.html#3129qlink2">&gt;Thank you for giving all of us Extropians an excellent reminder of why</a><br>
<i>&gt;we're Extropians and not simply transhumanists.</i><br>

<p>
The discussion of libertarianism is an old one in this list.

<p>
<a href="3095.html#3129qlink3">&gt;You make it sound like once a kid is grown into an adult, he can't</a><br>
<i>&gt;change his worldview.  I disagree very strongly.  When I graduated from</i><br>
<i>&gt;high school I was extremely socialist and a very devout christian.  Now</i><br>
<i>&gt;I'm neither.  No one gets a fair chance at competition until he/she</i><br>
<i>&gt;enters the "real world" and has to provide for himself.  Everyone gets</i><br>
<i>&gt;that chance.  Those of us who can change and adapt will and the others</i><br>
<i>&gt;will be left behind.  It's the circle of life.  :)</i><br>

<p>
Schroedinger wrote something like this: "Our ideas are not accepted because
their opponents accept them but because they die and the future generations
will accept our ideas to a greater extent than the present ones". Although
I agree one can change and adapt, I don't think this happens within the
majority of the population. How else do you explain religion? Notice that
in Saudi Arabia the Muslim religion prevails for centuries while in Ireland
its the Christian religion that prevails -- no practical changes occur.
Most people in the world  simply learn what is taught to them with no
critical mind.
