<a href="3368.html#3384qlink1">&gt;Assuming that you take yourself to be "intelligent", how do you know that</a><br>
<i>&gt;you know that you know and that you're not just a pre-programmed system which</i><br>
<i>&gt;has been programmed to claim that it knows that it knows? I'm not being</i><br>
<i>&gt;facetious here, I'm perfectly serious: most arguments against AI start by</i><br>
<i>&gt;claiming that humans have wonderful facilities which computers don't, when</i><br>
<i>&gt;they have absolutely no proof.</i><br>

<p>
My favorite example of something a human can do that a computer can't is putting
a
<br>
pillow case on a pillow. From our usual perspective, this seems trivial compared
to
<br>
playing grandmaster level chess or doing Matlab style symbolic integration - but
it
<br>
really does turn out to be very, very difficult!

<p>
I do believe that the essense of intelligence is computational - claiming it
isn't seems like dualism to me. We are, in a sense, preprogrammed systems. What
seperates us from Turing
<br>
machines though is the program we're running. There's nothing we can do that, in
theory, a computer can't. We're just not clever enough to tell it how.
