<a href="2323.html#2327qlink1"> &gt; Yes.  But while you're on the subject, there's no need to reinvent the</a><br>

<p>
I suggest you reread the thread. cDc's BackOrifice 2000 is in another
league entirely. No one can even remotely do what we were talking about.
 
<p>
<a href="2323.html#2327qlink2"> &gt; Having said that, I hope that this settles the technical question and that</a><br>

<p>
If this indeed would settle the question (i.e. finding a generic way
of mutating machine code or FPGA circuits robustly, and utilize this
in a global self-sustaining ALife ecosystem) you'd received a notice
from the Nobel prize comittee already. You'd also run a fair change to
trigger the Singularity (probably not on present substrate), too.

<p>
<a href="2323.html#2327qlink3"> &gt; those interested may now stop talking about it here and discuss further</a><br>
<i> &gt; plans via a non-public channel.  Really, the last thing you guys need is</i><br>
<i> &gt; for some enforcement agent to go searching the web for +GIMPS and +virus</i><br>
<i> &gt; and find your post (on the extropian maliing list archives) at the top of</i><br>
<i> &gt; the list.</i><br>
 
<p>
I do not see why. Freedom of thought and speech can't prevent me from
discussing the issue as long as no harm is done. As to the harm,
delaying development of such a worm would cause the more harm the
longer it is not deployed. Dynamic host/parasite equilibrium will take
its sweet time to coevolve, at the point of emergence being
necessarily in turmoil. Obviously, the sooner, the less damage done.

<p>
<a href="2323.html#2327qlink4"> &gt; Not to mention the fact that cracking is probably off-topic on the</a><br>
<i> &gt; extropian lists, but that's really secondary.</i><br>

<p>
Once again I suggest you reread the thread. This is not about cracking 
at all.

<p>
As to system security, that is indeed a very extropian topic.
