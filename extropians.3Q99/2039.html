Oh, it's not that bad.  Zubrin's Mars Direct requires some bravery,
<a name="2182qlink1">but not insanity, on the part of the crew.</a>  Not like the hyperbolic
<a name="2182qlink2">rendezvous they were pushing at CFM II.</a>
 
<p>
<a href="2035.html#2039qlink2">&gt; The 30th anniversary of the moon landing made me realize I</a><br>
<i>&gt; neglected an illustrative example.  Look at the *size* of the lunar</i><br>
<i>&gt; module.  Compare it with the immensity of the Saturn V.  It took one</i><br>
<i>&gt; helllll of a mighty rocket (one which we dont have anymore) to get</i><br>
<i>&gt; that leeeeetle spindly thing to soft land on the moon!</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2182qlink3">That leetle spindly thing massed 14,700 kg- 15 freaking tons to land
two people on the moon!</a>  With modern structures and subsystems, and
cryo propellanats, this could be reduced dramatically.

<p>
<a name="2182qlink4">As for mighty rockets, well, that could change fairly soon.  Further
I can't say, due to NDA.</a>

<p>
<a href="2035.html#2039qlink3">&gt; Mars is waaay farther away, (~7 months vs ~3 days) and it takes more</a><br>
<i>&gt; fuel to soft land, since Mars has twice the gravity of the moon.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2182qlink5">Nope- hypersonic entry and a parachute get you down to just 100 m/s,
instead of the 1700 m/s you need to back down from lunar orbit.</a>

<p>
<a name="2182qlink6"><a href="2035.html#2039qlink4">&gt; Now look at the size of the Roy Wolford's Biosphere experiment.</a><br>

<p>
That is not a good analogy- they tried to put all sorts of cutsie
biomes in there, instead of concentrating on the simpler task of
life support.</a> With just chemomechanical water loop closure and
<a name="2182qlink7">partial oxygen closure, the consumables are only about 1
kg/day/person, or a tonne per person for a 1000 day mission.  No
biology other than the crew themselves.</a>
 
<p>
<a href="2035.html#2039qlink5">&gt; So, Rob, once again, I will *very carefully* and sensitively suggest</a><br>
<i>&gt; (hoping not to generate an avalanche of canardic screeds)</i><br>
<i>&gt; that the first Mars colony, if attempted before nanotech, will</i><br>
<i>&gt; be require a single verrrry tiny caloric restricted woman, on a</i><br>
<i>&gt; one-way mission, with one hell of a lot of courage and determination.</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2182qlink8">Nah- 500 tons in LEO could send a well-supplied 4 person mission to
Mars (and return).  The issue isn't tech, it's money.</a>

<p>
<a href="2035.html#2039qlink6">&gt; Wise cracks are allowed, even encouraged, but do insert a grain</a><br>
<i>&gt; of serious thought in reply posts, such as: how much would you</i><br>
<i>&gt; estimate would be the weight of a reasonable minimal habitat for one</i><br>
<i>&gt; person.  Give me that, and I will estimate for you how many shuttle</i><br>
<i>&gt; launches it would take to make that happen.  spike</i><br>

<p>
<a name="2182qlink9">The key is not to use the shuttle for the project, but use large
cheap launchers developed for a different (and profitable) market.</a>
