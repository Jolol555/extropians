own

military
<br>
<a href="0288.html#0320qlink3">&gt;or other high performance aerobatic aircraft know that this perception is </a><br>
false,
<br>
<a href="0288.html#0320qlink4">&gt;because the people are ignoring changes in distance. To the observer, a </a><br>
vehicle
<br>
<a href="0288.html#0320qlink5">&gt;travelling across one's field of view will seem to come to a rapid stop and</a><br>
<i>&gt;hover, then zoom off in another direction, when in actuality they are </i><br>
conducting
<br>
<a href="0288.html#0320qlink6">&gt;a turn where the midpoint of the turn is when the plane is either moving </a><br>
toward
<br>
<i>&gt;or away from the observer, so it just seems to hover. Whenever I hear of a </i><br>
UFO
<br>
<a href="0288.html#0320qlink7">&gt;report that includes 'rapid changes in direction', I know what is actually </a><br>
going
<br>
<a href="0288.html#0320qlink8">&gt;on, and that the eyewitness is ignorant of flight dynamics, and lacks an </a><br>
ability
<br>
<a href="0288.html#0320qlink9">&gt;to think in three dimensions. Note that people have poor depth perception at</a><br>
<i>&gt;long range.</i><br>

Quite true in a great many cases, but there is a body of close-range</a> reports 
and other, videotaped reports, that indicate that we might be dealing with a 
truly exotic propulsion system.  There have been a handful of mass-sighting 
reports when the object under question was seen by many only at certain 
angles; to all intents and purposes, it was "invisible" to other witnesses 
who saw the object reappear shortly after.

<p>
<a name="0362qlink2">There's a meme running through the UFO counterculture that describes this as 
the effect of gravitational warping.  Theoretically, UFOs distort spacetime 
in order to fly, using gravitational lenses to focus on a particular point, 
which they _draw toward them_.  This way, there is no contradiction with 
physical laws; the UFOs aren't even really "flying," per se.</a>
