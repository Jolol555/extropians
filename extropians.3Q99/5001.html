Yes, I too was disappointed at the lack of detail and rigor in
this film.  How hard would it be to include a few seconds of FLIR
showing what reflections and gunshots look like?  I'm not convinced
that all those flashes were gunfire either, but I /am/ persuaded
that the ATF and FBI were and are lying through their teeth for
other reasons.

<p>
I'm surprized they didn't spend more time on the flashes that
appear before the second burst of "gunfire".  These are also
identified as reflections by the feds, but anyone can tell that
they were flames; no expertise is necessary to identify a burst
of flame when you see it, and this was a burst of flame.  The
fact that they still call this a reflection is an obvious lie.
The fact that the feds bulldozed the scene is reprehensible, and
can have no purpose other than covering up evidence.  I also
like to think I have some ability to judge the credibility of
a witness; a large part of being a poker player is being able
to tell when someone is lying.  The survivors they interviewed
were credible.  The 911 tape is credible.  The ATF and FBI
testimony at the hearings was not.  Kiri Jewell was not credible,
and was irrelevant anyway.  Senator Biden was clearly covering
his ass and that of the feds and didn't give a damn about truth.

<p>
The film could have been much better, but it was good to see
the principals involved talking about it firsthand anyway.
