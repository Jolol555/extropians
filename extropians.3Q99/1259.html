Hello everyone,

<p>
I just wanted to say thank you for all the feedback I have gotten from all 
of you in regards to how to improve my cognitive powers with various 
techniques and devices.<a name="1283qlink1">  I was surprised how many of you are into 
nutritional and chemical means of improvement but not mechanical means.  I 
felt like a lack of money on many of our parts may be why there were not 
people offering advice on the items listed in the excellent book 
</a>"Megabrains."  Actually I want methods that not only help me develop my 
intellectual potential but also deal with depression alleviation, focus, 
self-esteem and attitude.

<p>
As I buy the no-horizon goggles and hypno-peripheral audiocassettes, use 
ginko, the antidepressant Luvox and the a.d.d. treatment ritalin I will post 
to let you know what the results are.  Perhaps I will experience a 
transformation!  The Luvox alone may do that for me given 2-3 months on it.

<p>
One person I was really hoping to hear from was Natasha-Vita More.  She 
strikes me as someone who would have tried many different methods to achieve 
what I am looking for.  If you read this Ms. More and that is true please 
let me know what things do or don't work at least for you.

<p>
I must admit some of you have quite a sense of humor!  You were kidding 
right??

<p>
Sincerely,

<p>
John Grigg
