<p>
What has transpired from posts is an expression of personal aesthetics and
vision. 

<p>
Aesthetics is why Eric Watt Foryste says:

<p>
"I really like being outdoors, in urban environments
as well as rural ones, and if I'm lucky enough to be able to
leave this planet, I'll probably have to give up most of that
particular experience at that time, so I'm not eager to give it
up any earlier."

<p>
as Anders wrote:

<p>
"(snip) the city *I* want to live in is the waterfall city on the
artificial continent Forrest Bishop and I discussed two years ago on
this list (maybe we ought to write it up and do some engineering
calculations on it). I want to live in a tower high up in a city built
in and around a series of great waterfalls."

<p>
and Lee Daniel Crocker (without the pronoun -:):

<p>
"Imagine what you could do with dynamic display surfaces.  You could
probably do a very convincing impression of Eli's savanna, with
birds flying overhead and clouds drifting (without danger of
anything falling from either).  A mall open 24hrs with bright
full-spectrum lighting (UV-free so shoppers won't worry about
sunburn) could probably even grow real grass and flowers and
trees inside."

<p>
also, E. Shaun Russell:

<p>
However, my nan-city would have to be a productive one,
using technology to push all envelopes forward.  In fact, the ideal city
(for me) would be less a city than a spacecraft to explore the galaxy.
<a name="5107qlink2">That is the beauty of our future: one day, science will be so like art, and
art so like science, that it will be impossible and superfluous to
distinguish one from the other.</a>
