Some time ago - the late '70's, in fact - I realized that it might be 
possible to reorganize society along libertarian lines without directly 
confronting the state - at least until we were really ready.  I drew up 
multiple sets of detailed plans based on the idea of local networking - 
people networking, not computer networking, although I assumed that 
computers would play a large and increasing role - ruled via arbitration 
contracts backed by bonds, escrow, insurance and the ultimate threat of 
exclusion (corresponding to the "outlawing" of the common law courts of 
ancient Ireland).

<p>
Such a network could, I felt, answer real immediate needs, and operate at a 
substantial profit.  For example, the problems of service fraud, especially 
for consumers, but also for businesses, take a substantial bite out of 
general production.  Auto service fraud runs at about 60%, according to the 
state investigators.

<p>
Similar levels exist for plumbing, roof repair and, in general, every area 
in which the consumers have little expertise in evaluationg performance.*  
The occasional law suits are paid off if necessary - usually with silence 
agreements protecting the service against loss of reputation, which is the 
only factor that could actually stop the crimes.  In the vast majority of 
cases, however, the consumer never realizes that he - or, more often, she 
<br>
(women doing 85% of the consumer purchasing today) - is being ripped off.  <br>
Every eight years or so the state busts some major players - eg., Firestone, 
Sears, in auto repair - and then the perps put on a big show of correcting 
things and everyone forgets until it gets hot enough for "60 Minutes" again.

<p>
(*The almost unbelievable waste in computer-related purchasing is another <br>
perfect example of the danger of ignorance.  We could easilly have computers 
today that would be ten times as fast and software a generation more 
advanced were it not for the total dominance by mass marketing, specifically 
targeted at ignorant consumers, over quality and substance.)

<p>
A 60% loss to service fraud implies a potential profit of the same order to 
solving the problem.  A networking service which could substantially and 
demonstrably reduce the incidence of service fraud could make it on that 
alone, based on the figures.

<p>
However, a general network contract, which forced all disputes between 
members into binding arbitration could actually move us rapidly into a pure 
libertarian society.  I envisioned a system in which prisons, punishment, 
and crime itself were virtually non-existent, as the networking systems 
would provide investments for education tools, etc., on a personal level to 
virtually anyone who wanted to be productive, including even basket cases 
like the orphaned children of central Africa.*

<p>
(*Since my original analysis in the '70's, the highly succesful microloans <br>
program has thoroughly demonstrated the economic viability of such low-level 
investments, even through traditional banking mechanisms.  As the internet 
becomes universally available over the next ten years with the worldwide 
satellite coverage, a distributed investment system could target world 
capital efficiently to individuals anywhere on the globe.)

<p>
Meanwhile, criminals would simply find themselves excluded to those areas in 
which they could afford to pay the costs associated with the risks of 
dealing with them.  All communities, roads and services would effectively be 
gated, and, just as poor drivers pay high insurance premiums today, so 
access costs would directly reflect other destructive behavior.  As the 
criminals learned how to reduce those risks, their insurance and bond rates 
would fall, their credit ratings would rise, and the areas where they were 
welcome would expand to attract their trade.

<p>
In the libertarian movement I found little support for these ideas.  Most 
libertarians of that time were convinced that the state would soon 
self-destruct in a spectacular and violent way anyway and that the way to 
prepare was to accumulate stocks of food, guns and gold.  Even those 
libertarians who were pioneers in the personal computer movement felt that 
the big brother state would maintain a monopoly on massive computer power 
and would use it against us very effectively.s.

<p>
Then there were the libertarians who thought that political action was the 
way to go, and the war between the anti-LP and pro-LP factions occupied 
enormous amounts of time and resources in the movement.  The anti-LPers made 
destroying the LP via infiltration, sabotage or however a major priority, 
and, meanwhile, the LP sucked resources away from all the myriad of private 
libertarian projects that had bloomed in the late '60's, until they 
virtually disappeared.

<p>
(A further cost of the politicization of the movement was that the zeal of <br>
every little libertarian sect to maintain ideological purity virtually ended 
any serious theoretical work, as any deviation from the politically correct 
line meant ostracism at minimum, leaving many crucial practical questions 
and disputes - such as original property claims or children's rights or 
intellectual - unanswered.  This in turn undercut the credibility of 
libertarianism to the general public.)

<p>
Finally there were the networkers, although they were a tiny minority, as 
the anti-social, rugged individualism school saw little use in networking.  
I was in contact with a number of these pioneers and presented the idea of 
using the networking technology to bring about the revolution.  They, 
however, opposed it on the grounds that any such network would, thru its 
power of exclusion, potentially become just as bad as the state.  My 
argument that multiple competing private networks operating under a least 
common denominator umbrella of dispute resolution would offer options for 
people who, for example, wanted to maintain a Kosher social existence, or a 
traditional Muslim lifestyle, or voluntary socialism, etc., seemed of no 
avail.

<p>
NIH uber alles.

<p>
Now, however, it appears that utopia may actually be at hand, in spite of 
all of them.  On the Digital Village radio show of July 31st (see 
digitalvillage.org for real audio and text summary), there was some major 
discussion of the problems associated with the conflict over control of 
domain name registration.  More than one of the participants argued that 
ICAN's intention was to become a virtual government by establishing such 
things as universal contracts governing access to domain names.

<p>
This they (the guests on the program) strongly opposed.  Of course, I got 
the impression that these were the typical Pacifica (KPFK) lefty types, 
supporting statist "multiculturalism" over the horrors of an implicitly 
one-worlder, agorist, capitalist information revolution.  (I think that 
these people confuse themselves so much that if someone weren't opposing 
them they would of necessity fight themselves.)

<p>
Let us assume, for a moment, that they are actually in some measure correct 
about ICAN's direction and intentions.  Let's say that ICAN actually does 
institute some kind of net contract, specifying certain basic rules for 
being allowed to keep a domain and methods of resolving disputes.  There is 
nothing really to prevent this kind of universal social contract from 
expanding into exactly the kind of distributed social network that I 
originally envisioned, in which the states themselves are ultimately simply 
irrelevant.

<p>
I work in the marketing department of a Chinese multinational company and 
have observed the rapid growth in technologies that allow export/import 
businesses to control risk in transactions involving foreign partners over 
whom they have no real legal hold.  Such things as letters of credit and 
dispute resolution agreements make it possible to function efficiently 
outside the state mechanisms.  The internet now makes it possible to bring 
this to the individual level.

<p>
Later.
