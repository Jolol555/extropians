If you are going for prescription drugs try Provigil.  It works nicely
without the harsh effects of methamphetamine etc.

<a href="0535.html#0572qlink1">&gt; I know that during the WW2 there was Pervidrin in use by German</a><br>
pilots to
<br>
<a href="0535.html#0572qlink2">&gt; stay awake during their missions. Allied pilots must have used</a><br>
something
<br>
<i>&gt; like that also. Anyone having ideas?</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<br>
I know they gave British WWII troops Amphetamine Sulphate (Speed) for
the
<br>
same purpose.
<br>
Side effects? Short Term = Cramps, Bleeding Gums, Lethargy (all on
comedown). Long Term = Paranoia, Weight Loss, Heart Trouble (If you
REALLY
<br>
abuse the stuff).
<br>
These are all the bad side effects - there are good ones too,
especially the
<br>
intelligence boost. Speed helps you to concentrate and think as much
as you
<br>
like, without becoming bored or tired. Another is heightened sex
drive.
<br>
Speed is a powerful enhancer of sexual sensations. As they say -
speed's the
<br>
poor man's coke.
