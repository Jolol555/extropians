<a name="3097qlink1">If a law were passed that required the teaching of both evolutionary theory
and creationism in state schools, that would actually be a great
improvement on the present situation.</a> From teaching philosophy of religion
classes for a number of semesters now (where I always cover the design
argument), I can tell you that no more than perhaps 5% of my students have
ever been taught evolutionary theory. If it were required material in
biology (ideally with creationism being taught in a religion class), public
understanding of this idea would improve greatly.

<p>
Of course I would rather see evolutionary theory taught, with creationism
only covered in (currently non-existent) courses in critical thinking.
Still, if more people actually knew anything about evolutionary theory, I
believe a far higher proportion of the population would see that
creationism just doesn't stand up by comparison.

<p>
Teaching creationism as a real science probably will make the USA a
laughing stock of the world, but if it were accompanied by explanation of
evolutionary theory, people would be a lot smarter in their thinking.

<p>
Until then, I will continue to use part of my philosophy of religion and
philosophy of human nature classes as crash courses in evolution.
