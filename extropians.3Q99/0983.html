<a name="1014qlink1"><a name="0997qlink1">Actually, I think what you've run into here is a perfectly rational 
response to a world filled with charlatans.</a>  It isn't possible for me to 
personally research every unlikely claim that I hear, because there are 
simply too many of them.  An intelligent, sane person will deal with this 
problem by placing all such ideas into a mental holding tank, labeled 
"probably false, but I don't actually know for certain", and ignore them 
unless clear evidence turns up.  He will actualy investigate one of these 
claims every once in a while, as a way of keeping his classification scheme 
accurate, and he will slowly build up a list of others who he trusts to 
accurately assess such claims.</a>

<a name="1014qlink2">Now, I know nothing about this "Face on Mars business".  However, I am well 
aware of the fact that you can find any pattern you want to in a 
low-resolution photograph if you stare at it long enough.</a>  That, plus the 
<a name="1014qlink3">fact that there have been several similar claims about alien artifacts on 
Earth and on the Moon (all of which have turned out</a> to be false), leads me 
to suspect that these claims will probably turn out to be false.  Since the 
<a name="1074qlink1">idea of technological aliens having visited our</a> solar system in any fashion 
<a name="1014qlink4">is itself problematic (it is virtually impossible to construct a scenario 
that makes any sense),</a> I conclude that there is no reason for me to invest 
several days of my time<a name="1014qlink5"> learning all the details of the theory.</a>

<p>
<a name="1014qlink6"><a name="0997qlink2">If I happen to be wrong, firm evidence will turn up in time (and the fact 
that I dismissed it for a few years won't hurt me).  If I'm right, I've 
saved myself some time.  Either way I'm not going to waste time arguing 
with people who believe in the theory (I leave that to the people who have 
actually investigated this particular claim).</a></a>

<a name="1014qlink7">Do you think there is something wrong with this strategy?</a>
