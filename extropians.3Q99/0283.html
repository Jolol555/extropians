<a href="0242.html#0283qlink1">&gt;&gt;If aliens are here, I don't think they'll be particularly interested in</a><br>
our 
<br>
<a href="0242.html#0283qlink2">&gt;&gt;money or our women (though Bruce Sterling's Investors have a ring of </a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt;authenticity to them...).  Rather, they'll be interested in our</i><br>
_uniqueness_. 
<br>
<a href="0242.html#0283qlink3">&gt;&gt;And this is the one thing that would be destroyed by public disclosure.</a><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Look, just think for five seconds about the implications of the kinds of</i><br>
<i>&gt;technologies we talk about here. Any aliens who didn't want to be seen</i><br>
would
<br>
<a href="0242.html#0283qlink4">&gt;not be seen. If they don't want to be seen because that would destroy our</a><br>
<i>&gt;'uniqueness', then why are so many people reporting that they've seen them?</i><br>

<p>
Maybe they're as stupid and careless as we are.  Ever try to sneak up and
observe a bird?  It's very hard for the bird not to notice you.  I think the
way to solve this mystery is to give every US citizen an AA gun and train
everyone to shoot at UFOs. Then maybe we get some real evidence...

<p>
You realize I'm kidding.
