<a href="4268.html#4279qlink1">&gt; &gt;I doubt very much that any court would ever hold a man responsible for</a><br>
<i>&gt; &gt;the support of a child produced in a situation where he was raped.</i><br>

<p>
There are many cases of the 16-year-old girl/12-year-old boy type,
but which could not by any sane person's definition of the word be
called "rape" (and therefore requires a legislature's definition).
I am not specifically aware of any cases involving genuine rape, but
I'm sure the rulings would apply.  There are also cases of men being
defrauded into paternity by women knowingly misleading the man
involved, a well-known case of a woman explicity absolving a father
of responsibility by contract and then renegging with the court's
blessing, and even one case where a woman's estranged husband was
required to support her child by another man despite a DNA test
proving that he was not the father.  Never underestimate what
bizarre stretches of logic a court is capable of.
