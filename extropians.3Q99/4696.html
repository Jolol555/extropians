<a name="4736qlink1">There is a city, I believe in Arizona, being constructed in an
architectural/ecological framework by an architect (whose name
I don't remember), who apparently came to America to study under
Frank Lloyd Wright.  The gentleman, I believe is now in his '80s
and his students/city citizens slowly build/add-on to the city
as funds from lectures, tours, etc. permit.</a>

<p>
[I'm sure someone on this list can fill in the details...]

<p>
This might serve as an interesting starting place for cities of
the future (as well as an interesting lecture for Extro5). 

<p>
One thing that is clear is that cities of the future will have
*much* more variety.  We are now cost constrained in most of
our architecture.  When we are freed from such constraints
people will be able to build much more imaginatively.  You
may have triangle-city, box-city, sphere-city, pentagon-city,
<pre>
bucky-ball-city, blue-city, green-city, red-city, light-city,
heavy-city, soft-city, hard-city, rough-city, smooth-city,
clear-city, opaque-city, sun-city, rainy-city, windy-city,
</pre>
snow-city, ice-city, water-city, lumpy-city, and so on and so
forth.  The architectural possibilities seem really stunning.

<p>
It will be interesting to see<a name="4701qlink1"> whether we explore all of these
possibilities to their fullest extent or whether we decide
that it is meaningless.</a>  Would you want to live in a city
that through its fundamental architecture promotes violence
or adventure (crim-city, insan-city), or extreme regularity
and safety (bordo-city) or simply chaos (randomo-city)?

<p>
<a name="4701qlink2">And would you want to live in a city at all, if</a> instead
you can be uploaded and live in any virtua-city?
