I blame children's ignorance on the type of isolated socialism I observe all 
around me, every day.  It used to be if a child wanted to learn how to hunt 
he would visit the master hunter of the tribe.  If he wanted to learn to 
make tents he'd visit the tent maker.  In tribes usually the children are 
brought up by the community, not just by their parents.  If the communities 
would become less isolated and more socialite then we should be able to 
raise more educated children.

<p>
The question is how to do it.  I would suggest many neighborhood social 
events.  Of course I don't have resources for this nor the time to assemble 
people and require the resources so I really can't talk much.
