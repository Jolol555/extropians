<a name="3595qlink1">I put this question to a friend today who is an excellent cook.
She said that if peanut brittle is insufficiently heated, the
carmelization process would be incomplete.  Perhaps a brittle
substance could be produced that would appear almost clear.
Looks like glass, tastes like sugar.  I dont see why one could not
make a bottle out of such a confection, and stick a beer
label on it, for effect.</a>  In fact beer bottles are brown, like
peanut brittle.  Break the thing right before everyone's
wondering eyes, and start eating.  That sounds like a great
gag to pull at Extro5.  {8^D  spike
