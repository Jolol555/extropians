  Your theory is a speculative psychological 
  assessment about what people would do for 
  various reasons. Psychology and reasons are 
  infinitely variable, only physics is perfectly
  reliable. Physical facts tell us that there
  is gunfire at the Mt Carmel Center, that 
  the tanks created a fire trap, that they 
  pumped potentially flammable agents in, that 
  pyrotechnics devices were found in the same
  area the building was, not just away from it
  (<a href="http://users.erols.com/igoddard/waco-3.htm">http://users.erols.com/igoddard/waco-3.htm</a>)
  (which you don't hear on TV), that a pyrolike
   hot-spot appears on a wall just above 
  where a tank suddenly departed, and that the
  (<a href="http://www.erols.com/igoddard/wacofire.htm">http://www.erols.com/igoddard/wacofire.htm</a>)
  gunmen work in conjunction with the tanks in
  an organized fashion, to name a few things.
