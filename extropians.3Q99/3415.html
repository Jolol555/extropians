Short term memory, which obviously does not involve "long-term-potentation"
has to involve a repeating feedback loop.  You could obviously get
person-to-person variants here in the size of the brain devoted to
this loop, the rate at which it repeats, the rate at which it accepts
interference from outside sources (noise, etc.).

<p>
Short term memory, is probably a horrible criteria by which to judge
mental effectiveness.

Plausible, if you don't suffer from a handicap of quantity or throughput,
then then the balance is restored by allowing the unutilized resources
carry "wider" thoughts than are carried by people manipulating more
symbols.  An interesting question would be to analyze those 'subunits'
to see what associations they carry.  [Ah yes, 102-1297 -- the day
7 days after my birthday each year and the combined score of my
SATs - 43...]  The interesting thing about the brain is that the
subprocessors are likely to find these associations whether or not
you have any interest in them!]

Sure, one is memory based, one is fuzzy-logic pattern matching based.
All of us have all of these capabilities but we haven't learned the
degree to which genes or developmental processes can enhance or
handicap them.
