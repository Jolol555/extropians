<a href="2522.html#2529qlink1">&gt;Good for you, just don't misattribute to me things that are said by your</a><br>
<i>&gt;own countryman, Timothy Bates...</i><br>

<p>
Woops. Apologies.

<p>
<a href="2522.html#2529qlink2">&gt;&gt; Yes. Academic psychology has fallen on hard times here in Australia. But</a><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; its because money has been taken away from education by the government. Our</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; "socialist" government no longer wants to spend the same amounts of money</i><br>
<i>&gt;&gt; on education (and research in general is an even lower priority).</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Education is not research.</i><br>

<p>
I meant money on education facilities (i.e. universities). In Australia the
area of education refers both to education and research at universities.

<p>
<a href="2522.html#2529qlink3">&gt;All of your nationalized businesses together</a><br>
<i>&gt;spend less on R&amp;D than Microsoft.</i><br>

<p>
Which nationalized businesses? It sounds like you think everything is
nationalized in Australia (banks, electricity, gas, phones, etc.) this is
rapidly ceasing to be the case.

<p>
<a name="2531qlink1">Can you give some figures? I would be interested what the larger companies
spend on r&amp;d.
</a>

<p>
<a name="2531qlink2"><a href="2522.html#2529qlink4">&gt;Corporate research has far oustripped government research, as the</a><br>
<i>&gt;current new economy has educated them to the value of it. Nationalized</i><br>
<i>&gt;businesses in other countries are being gutted of basic research in</i><br>
<i>&gt;order to fund the baby boomer choke point of the welfare trough.</i><br>

<p>
I would be interested in seeing figures. I don't pretend to have an in
depth knowledge of how money is spent on r&amp;d (either here or abroad). I
</a>
would be interested in the argument that University of California (for
instance) does little or no research. How is this judged? Certainly I have
no argument that lots of research dollars are spent outside universities in
the corporate sector.

<p>
<a href="2522.html#2529qlink5">&gt;fascist: one who beleives that the will and needs of the state as a</a><br>
<i>&gt;whole is paramount.</i><br>
<i>&gt;socialist: one who beleives the will and needs of society as a whole is</i><br>
<i>&gt;paramount.</i><br>

<p>
OK. No argument here.

<p>
best, patrick
