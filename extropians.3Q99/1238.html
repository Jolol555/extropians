Well, Billy didn't say "without a trace", he said "kill off a spacefaring 
civilization" (or words to that effect).  I think you could come close, or 
probably actually do this, with advanced nano and AI.  If you REALLY wanted 
to be creepy and weird, you could do it in a way that would wipe out most 
traces that the target had every existed AND that deactivated the weapon when 
it was done.  Now, why anyone would want to do this is beyond me: It seems by 
far the most far-fetched of any of the scenarios we've discussed in these 
threads.
