<a href="5096.html#5104qlink1">&gt; It's your insistance that we are somehow not capable of understanding</a><br>
<i>&gt; your point that gets people pissed.  The extropian list isn't a bunch</i><br>
<i>&gt; of catholic Martha Stewart nuns, you know.</i><br>

<p>
I never even implied anything of the sort, much less insisted.  I
think everyone here does understand the point.  I think many still
disagree, and that's fine too.  I try to persuade others to my point
of view because I believe it, and I believe that if more people
shared it the world would be a better place to live.  That's the
whole point of having a point of view--any point of view.  

<p>
<a href="5096.html#5104qlink2">&gt; You ignore the good arguments for being civil and kind, and keep</a><br>
<i>&gt; saying how good you are to have evolved way beyond us. (By now I've</i><br>
<i>&gt; ascertained that you like to get reactions of this type anyway) and</i><br>
<i>&gt; you seem to have forgotten that you are *posting* to</i><br>
<i>&gt; Extopians@extropy.org,. so you're not talking to inferiors.</i><br>

<p>
Again, I've done nothing of the sort.  When this same argument came
up the first time, there were those who put forth very good arguments
for restraint--you and Eric among them.  I acknowledged those, and
continued to argue against them because I wasn't convinced.  Don't
make the same mistake you accuse me of by assuming I don't hear and
understand the arguments on the other side.

<p>
I freely admit that I consider myself a superior philosopher to 99.9%
of the human population, and probably 95% of the members of this list
(who are a very bright bunch from whom I have learned much, because
all of them are more talented than I in some field or other).  I make
no apologies for that opinion, but I also see no reason why anyone
should be threatened<a name="5115qlink1"> by it.  Arrogance is harmless folly; it is
</a>
rigidity that gets in the way of learning and growing.

<p>
And finally, yes, I often enjoy angry reactions to my ideas, because
that's a clue that I'm onto something important.  Stuff nobody cares
about just gets ignored (and I've posted plenty of that too).
