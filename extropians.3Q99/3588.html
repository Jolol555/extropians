This would be a mistake.  Since there is so much volume on extropians,
most of us need to sift thru and read only the posts on our specialty
topics or by our favorite posters.  Much of the offensive material
is kookified and never read.

<p>
True.  Altho we have our share of grumpy bears on extropians, it is
at least as civilized as others I read.

I was hoping someone would say this.<a name="3596qlink1">  I met a man at E4 who I didnt
know, who was not wearing a name tag.  We spoke for some time before

the incident and we got along fine.  I met one of the most notorious

rexes there too.  He seemed like a perfect gentleman in person.  (?!)

This brings up an interesting point.  I think that we all have active internal
censors, that we have developed from a young age, kindergarten, that
help us in social situations.  For some strange reason, we switch this module
to off when we post to the internet.  When in a medium far more permanent
than print, we freely say things that we would *never* utter in person!
<a name="3591qlink3">I myself have made gags [such as giving up masturbation, etc] that I could
*never* state in the presence of my oldest and closest friends, yet I have
