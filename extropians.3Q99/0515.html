neurocardiologist
<br>
<a name="0516qlink1"><a href="0447.html#0515qlink1"> &gt;have found that 60 to 65% of the cells of the heart are actually neural</a><br>
<i> &gt;cells, not muscle cells as was previously believed. They are identical</i><br>
<i> &gt;to the neural cells in the brain, operating through the same connecting</i><br>
<i> &gt;links called ganglia, with the same axonal and dendritic connections that</i><br>
<i> &gt;take place in the brain, as well as through the very same kinds of</i><br>
<i> &gt;neurotransmitters found in the brain.</i><br>
<i> &gt;</i><br>
<a name="0562qlink2"><i> &gt;Quite literally, in other words, there is a "brain" in the heart, whose</i><br>
<i> &gt;ganglia are linked to every major organ in the body, to the entire</i><br>
<i> &gt;muscle spindle system that uniquely enables humans to express their</i><br>
<i> &gt;emotions. About half of the heart's neural cells are involved in</i><br>
</a>
<i> &gt;translating information sent to it from all over the body so that it can</i><br>
<i> &gt;keep the body</i><br>
<i> &gt;working as one harmonious whole. And the other half make up a very</i><br>
<i> &gt;large, unmediated neural connection with the emotional brain in our head</i><br>

<p>
     So how similar are the imprints and (meta)programs taken</a> by this 
heart-brain to the head-brain imprints and (meta)programs described by 
Lilly, Leary and Wilson? Is there a technology for working with these 
programs to be adapted from PROGRAMMING AND METAPROGRAMMONG THE HUMAN 
BIOCOMPUTER, INFO-PSYCHOLOGY AND PROMETHEUS RISING or would it be a 
diffferent approach altogether?

<p>
<a href="0447.html#0515qlink2"> &gt;environment profoundly changes the genetic structuring within us, that</a><br>
<i> &gt;it is the biggest influence of all on our DNA. There are studies now that</i><br>
<i> &gt;show that our genes are not at all locked into unchanging programs as</i><br>
<i> &gt;previously</i><br>
<i> &gt;thought, but in fact are profoundly affected by our environment,</i><br>

<p>
     I would be interested to hear more about this research as we are 
revising our neo-Lamarckian MANIFESTO OF THE NEW EVOLUTION for release to 
the public.


<p>
Around the age of eleven or twelve the brain undergoes a
<br>
<a href="0447.html#0515qlink3"> &gt;fine tuning and begins to decide what it can get rid of.</a><br>

<p>
     Again, is there a technology for metaprogramming this?
