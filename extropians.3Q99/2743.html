Abstract
<br>
  EEG activity, alertness, and mood were assessed in 40 adults given 3 minutes
  of aromatherapy using two aromas, lavender (considered a
  relaxing odor) or rosemary (considered a stimulating odor). Participants were
  also given simple math computations before and after the therapy. The
<a name="2747qlink1">  lavender group showed increased beta power, suggesting increased drowsiness,
  they had less depressed mood (POMS) and reported feeling more relaxed and
  performed the math computations faster and more accurately following
  aromatherapy.</a> The rosemary group, on the other hand, showed
  decreased frontal alpha and beta power, suggesting increased alertness. They
  also had lower state anxiety scores, reported feeling more relaxed and alert
  and they were only faster, not more accurate, at completing the math
  computations after the aromatherapy session.
