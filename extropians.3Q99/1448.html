Abstract
<br>
  Experiments have shown that the amount and source of dietary
  energy may alter protein metabolism. A high fat diet has resulted in greater
  nitrogen retention than a high carbohydrate (CHO) diet. To
  examine this question further, adult rats were fed diets providing ratios of
  CHO:FAT as a percentage of energy of 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 or 3.0 for 6 wk.
  Mean energy and protein intakes were 93.0 +/- 0.8 kcal/d and 5.3 +/- 0.1 g/d,
  respectively. Final body weight was lower in rats fed the high fat diet
<br>
  (CHO:FAT, 0.5) than in rats fed the high carbohydrate diet<br>
  (CHO:FAT, 3.0) (P less than 0.05), and a linear response was observed over<br>
  the entire range of treatments (r = 0.92). Rats fed the high fat diet had the
  highest nitrogen balance; values were significantly (P less than 0.05)
  different from those of rats fed high carbohydrate diets
<br>
  (CHO:FAT, 2.0 or 2.5) when expressed as mg nitrogen/kcal energy gain. Rats<br>
  fed the high fat diet had the highest protein gain and the lowest fat gain as
  a function of energy gain. It is concluded that alterations in nonprotein
  energy source result in metabolic changes, which may be related to
  adaptations in energy expenditure and/or protein deposition.
