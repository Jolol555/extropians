<a name="4116qlink1"><a href="4081.html#4089qlink1">&gt; "Starship Troopers" was the book that convinced me to enlist</a><br>
&gt; (U.S.M.C.) back in '74.

<p>
For those on the list not already familiar with it, I also
heartily recommend Heinlein's /Starship Troopers/ as a classic
of both SF in general and Heinlein political-commentary SF in
particular.  I strongly recommend /against/ seeing the excrable
recent movie which bears no resemblance at all to the book
other than title and a few characters.</a>

<p>
<a name="4116qlink2">I was a Lefebvrian pacifist for much of my life, and never had
any interest at all in miltary service, but this book made me
regret that I never enlisted.  That's just a warning to any of
you of prime military age--if you are at all impressionable,
you'll find yourself at the recruitment center before the last
chapter.  The movie, on the other hand, will have you thinking
of all military as evil Nazis, which I believe was the director's
intent.  Maybe he did it on a dare or something, just to see if
he could make a movie with a completely opposite point of view
to the original story (I'm amazed anyone in Hollywood still
deals with scum like Paul Verhoeven, whose history of broken
pomises and sleazy deals would make a movie itself).</a>

<p>
<a name="4116qlink3">Let's just hope nobody screws up /The Moon is a Harsh Mistress/.</a>
