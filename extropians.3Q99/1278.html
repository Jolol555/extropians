<i>&gt;NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 recommendation                            $12,253,800,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 1999 appropriation</i><br>
<i>&gt;13,665,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 budget request</i><br>
<i>&gt;13,578,400,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 1999 appropriation    - 1,411,200,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 2000 request               - 1,324,600,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The National Aeronautics and Space Administration was created by the</i><br>
<i>&gt;National Space Act of 1958.  NASA conducts space and aeronautics research,</i><br>
<i>&gt;development, and flight activity designed to ensure and maintain U.S.</i><br>
<i>&gt;preeminence in space and aeronautical endeavors.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee recommends a total program level of $12,253,800,000 in fiscal</i><br>
<i>&gt;year 2000, which is a decrease of $1,324,600,000 from the budget request and</i><br>
<i>&gt;$1,411,200,000 below the fiscal year 1999 enacted appropriation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee recognizes that the funding reduction for NASA is significant.</i><br>
<i>&gt;However, when looked at on a program-by-program or project-by-project basis,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the recommendations are less severe than they appear at first.  Projects</i><br>
<i>&gt;which are specifically noted for cancellation are for the most part early in</i><br>
<i>&gt;their development, so sunk costs are minimal and long-term savings are</i><br>
<i>&gt;significant.  This is true of SIRTF, Contour, and LightSAR.  Additionally,</i><br>
<i>&gt;other reductions are in the budgets for planning future missions and</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology development, and many of these budgets have grown significantly</i><br>
<i>&gt;over the last two years.  Examples include: supporting research and</i><br>
<i>&gt;technology within the Space Science account, which has increased by over</i><br>
<i>&gt;$250,000,000 since fiscal year 1998; planning for future missions in the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Explorer and Discovery programs, which have increased by $145,000,000 since</i><br>
<i>&gt;fiscal year</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[p. 77]]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;year 1998; Earth Probes funding has increased over $100,000,000 since fiscal</i><br>
<i>&gt;year 1998; and the Earth Observing System Data Information System program</i><br>
<i>&gt;has expended more than $1,600,000,000 since its inception and has delivered</i><br>
<i>&gt;minimal products to NASA despite this expenditure.  Numerous other examples</i><br>
<i>&gt;could be cited, these are only the most compelling reasons which justify the</i><br>
<i>&gt;reductions proposed by the Committee.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 recommendation                            $ 5,388,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 1999 appropriation</i><br>
<i>&gt;5,480,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 budget request</i><br>
<i>&gt;5,638,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 1999 appropriation         - 92,200,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 2000 request                  - 250,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This appropriation provides for human space flight activities, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;development of the international space station and operation of the space</i><br>
<i>&gt;shuttle.  This account also includes support of planned cooperative</i><br>
<i>&gt;activities with Russia, upgrades to the performance and safety of the space</i><br>
<i>&gt;shuttle, and required construction projects in direct support of the space</i><br>
<i>&gt;station and space shuttle programs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee recommends a total of $5,388,000,000 for the human space</i><br>
<i>&gt;flight account in fiscal year 2000.  The recommendation is a decrease of</i><br>
<i>&gt;$250,000,000 from the budget request and $92,000,000 below the fiscal year</i><br>
<i>&gt;1999 enacted appropriation.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee recommendation includes a reduction of $100,000,000 from the</i><br>
<i>&gt;budget request for Space Shuttle Operations.  The Committee received many</i><br>
<i>&gt;requests for additional funding for the upgrades to the shuttle but was</i><br>
<i>&gt;unable to accommodate the additional funding at this time.  The Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt;will continue to monitor the shuttle program and may be able to address this</i><br>
<i>&gt;issue prior to final enactment of this bill.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee remains committed to safe operation of the space shuttle</i><br>
<i>&gt;program and does not believe the funding reduction proposed will jeopardize</i><br>
<i>&gt;the program's record of safe operations.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee applauds the progress being made by NASA and its partners in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the assembly of the International Space Station.  However, the Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt;remains concerned that continued progress may be hampered if Russian assets</i><br>
<i>&gt;continue to be diverted to the MIR [[sic]] space station.  It is imperative</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the MIR space station not become a drain on the limited financial</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources of Russia.  It is also vital that the infrastructure in central</i><br>
<i>&gt;Asia, as well as Russian Soyuz and Progress vehicles, remain dedicated to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the priority of supporting assembly and operation of the International Space</i><br>
<i>&gt;Station.  NASA is directed to take all action necessary to ensure that the</i><br>
<i>&gt;MIR station does not become a liability to the International Space Station</i><br>
<i>&gt;program and that Russia lives up to its previous commitments to assist in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the assembly and operations of the International Space Station.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee continues to be concerned about increasing requirements and</i><br>
<i>&gt;costs in the International Space Station program.  While Congress has</i><br>
<i>&gt;advocated introducing more commercialization and privatization into the ISS</i><br>
<i>&gt;program, the Committee sees little</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[p. 78]]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;progress at NASA toward implementing this direction.  The Committee believes</i><br>
<i>&gt;long-term cost savings will result from more commercial involvement and</i><br>
<i>&gt;endorses the White House stated policy that commercially available goods and</i><br>
<i>&gt;services should be purchased to the maximum extent possible.  To this end,</i><br>
<i>&gt;the Committee directs NASA to aggressively consider commercial proposals for</i><br>
<i>&gt;ISS program requirements.  Except for cases involving national security or</i><br>
<i>&gt;public safety concerns, when a commercial provider proposes a solution that</i><br>
<i>&gt;meets mission requirements in a cost-effective manner, the agency must</i><br>
<i>&gt;accept the commercial proposal.  If NASA determines it is not in the best</i><br>
<i>&gt;interest of the government for reasons other than national security or</i><br>
<i>&gt;public safety, NASA must demonstrate the reasons for pursuing a</i><br>
<i>&gt;non-commercial solution.  In cases involving cost comparisons between</i><br>
<i>&gt;government and commercial options, NASA must compare the proposed commercial</i><br>
<i>&gt;price against the full cost associated with the government solution,</i><br>
<i>&gt;including fixed costs for maintaining government assets.  The Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt;believes it is critical that NASA not compete with commercial providers for</i><br>
<i>&gt;routine space hardware and service requirements.  NASA must endeavor to</i><br>
<i>&gt;create an environment that fosters the growth of a commercial space industry</i><br>
<i>&gt;to service commercial ISS users.  It is the Committee's strong belief that</i><br>
<i>&gt;utilizing commercial services at this time will help control long-term ISS</i><br>
<i>&gt;costs and encourage more commercial interest in the ISS program.</i><br>

<i>&gt;SCIENCE, AERONAUTICS AND TECHNOLOGY</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 recommendation                           $ 4,575,700,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 1999 appropriation</i><br>
<i>&gt;5,653,300,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 budget request                                5,424,700,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 1999 appropriation   - 1,078,200,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 2000 request                 - 849,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;This appropriation provides for the research and development activities of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.  These activities</i><br>
<i>&gt;include: space science, life and microgravity science, earth sciences,</i><br>
<i>&gt;aeronautical research and technology, advanced concepts and technology,</i><br>
<i>&gt;launch services, and academic programs.  Funds are also included for the</i><br>
<i>&gt;construction, maintenance, and operation of programmatic facilities.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee recommends $4,575,700,000 for Science, Aeronautics and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Technology in fiscal year 2000.  The amount recommended is $849,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;below the budget request.  The amount provided includes a decrease of</i><br>
<i>&gt;$640,800,000 for Space Science, and increase of $7,000,000 for Life and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Microgravity Sciences and Applications, a decrease of $285,000,000 for Earth</i><br>
<i>&gt;Sciences, an increase of $43,500,000 for Aero-Space Technology, no change to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the budget request for Mission Communications Services, and an increase of</i><br>
<i>&gt;$26,300,000 for Academic Programs.  Specific program adjustments are</i><br>
<i>&gt;explained below.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;SPACE SCIENCE</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For space science programs, the Committee recommends the following changes</i><br>
<i>&gt;to the budget request:</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Cancellation of the Space Infrared Telescope Facility for a budget</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduction of $100,800,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[p. 79]]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. Reduce funding for future planning for the Explorer program by</i><br>
<i>&gt;$60,000,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. Reduce funding for future planning for the Discovery program future</i><br>
<i>&gt;mission [[sic]] by $60,000,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. Cancellation of the Contour mission for a savings of $50,000,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. Reduce funding for future Mars missions by $75,000,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;6. Reducing funding for supporting research and technology by $320,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;of which $200,000,000 is to be taken from the Technology program and</i><br>
<i>&gt;$120,000,000 is to be taken from the Research program.</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. An increase of $10,000,000 for Space Solar Power.</i><br>
<i>&gt;8. An increase of $2,000,000 for the Science Center at Glendale Community</i><br>
<i>&gt;College.</i><br>
<i>&gt;9. An increase of $1,500,000 for the Louisville Science Center.</i><br>
<i>&gt;10. An increase of $1,500,000 for the Science Center Initiative at Ohio</i><br>
<i>&gt;Wesleyan University.</i><br>
<i>&gt;11. An increase of $5,000,000 for the Polymer Energy Rechargeable System.</i><br>
<i>&gt;12. An increase of $2,000,000 for the center on life in extreme thermal</i><br>
<i>&gt;environments at Montana State University in Bozeman.</i><br>
<i>&gt;13. An increase of $3,000,000 for the Adler Planetarium in Chicago,</i><br>
<i>&gt;Illinois.</i><br>
<i>&gt;14. NASA is directed to provide a total of $20,000,000 for fundamental</i><br>
<i>&gt;physics research.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;LIFE AND MICROGRAVITY SCIENCES</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For Life and Microgravity Sciences and Applications, the Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt;recommends the following adjustments to the budget request:</i><br>
<i>&gt;1.   An increase of $1,000,000 for the "Garden Machine" program at Texas</i><br>
<i>&gt;Tech University.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. An increase of $4,000,000 for the Space Radiation program at Loma Linda</i><br>
<i>&gt;University Hospital.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. An increase of $2,000,000 for the Neutron Therapy facility at Fermilab.</i><br>
<i>&gt;As part of the fiscal year 1999 appropriations bill, the Congress provided</i><br>
<i>&gt;$15,000,000 and directed NASA to conduct research using the shuttle for a</i><br>
<i>&gt;dedicated mission.  NASA declined to pursue such a mission, citing a lack of</i><br>
<i>&gt;resources.  The Committee reiterates that providing regular research flight</i><br>
<i>&gt;opportunities for life and microgravity during space station assembly is</i><br>
<i>&gt;critical for providing scientists the opportunity to develop research</i><br>
<i>&gt;capabilities needed for optimal utilization of the station.  The Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt;is dismayed that, despite numerous expressions of concern from the Congress</i><br>
<i>&gt;on this issue, and the provision of extra funds, NASA has not yet responded</i><br>
<i>&gt;to include additional research flights in its shuttle launch schedule.  The</i><br>
<i>&gt;current plan includes only one life and microgravity research shuttle</i><br>
<i>&gt;mission over at least a 5-year period from 1999 through 2004.  This is</i><br>
<i>&gt;unacceptable.  The Committee directs NASA to use the $15,000,000 provided in</i><br>
<i>&gt;fiscal year 1999 to pursue near-term flight opportunities for life and</i><br>
<i>&gt;microgravity sciences.  Specifically, NASA should use the funding to</i><br>
<i>&gt;increase the research allocation on STS-107 and to initiate work on a new</i><br>
<i>&gt;research mission</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[p. 80]]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;in the early fiscal year 2002 timeframe.  The Committee believes annual</i><br>
<i>&gt;dedicated life and microgravity research flights during the space station</i><br>
<i>&gt;assembly period are essential and directs NASA to actively pursue this goal.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;EARTH SCIENCES</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For Earth Sciences, the Committee recommends the following adjustments to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the budget request:</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. Cancellation of the GLOBE program for a savings of $5,000,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. A reduction of $100,000,000 from the Earth Probes program, including</i><br>
<i>&gt;cancellation of the TRIANA [[sic]] program, the LightSAR program, and the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Earth System Science Pathfinders program.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. The Earth Observing System budget request is reduced by $150,000,000,</i><br>
<i>&gt;consisting of $60,000,000 from the Technology Infusion program, $40,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduction in algorithm development, and $50,000,000 from the EOS follow-on</i><br>
<i>&gt;effort.</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. The Earth Observing System Data Information System budget request is</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduced by $50,000,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. An increase of $2,000,000 for a Remote Sensing Center for Geoinformatics</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the University of Mississippi.</i><br>
<i>&gt;6. An increase of $1,000,000 for the Advanced Tropical Remote Sensing Center</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the National Center for Tropical Remote Sensing Applications and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Resources at the Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science.</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. An increase of $10,000,000 for the Regional Application Center in Cayuga</i><br>
<i>&gt;County, New York.</i><br>
<i>&gt;8. An increase of $2,500,000 for a joint U.S./Italian space-based research</i><br>
<i>&gt;initiative for the study and detection of forest fires.</i><br>
<i>&gt;9. An increase of $3,000,000 for continuation of programs at the American</i><br>
<i>&gt;Museum of Natural History.</i><br>
<i>&gt;10. An increase of $1,500,000 for a remote sensing center at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fulton-Montgomery Community College in New York.  The center is to work</i><br>
<i>&gt;through the Regional Application Center at Cayuga County, New York.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee is disappointed in NASA's effort to use unmanned aerial</i><br>
<i>&gt;vehicles (UAVs) to meet science requirements.  The ERAST program has spent</i><br>
<i>&gt;in excess of $100,000,000 over the past five years to push the development</i><br>
<i>&gt;of operational UAV platforms.  ERAST is close to completing its technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;objectives, and the Office of Space Science should now design a robust</i><br>
<i>&gt;program to utilize this new science platform.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee understands that NASA's current plans include only a minimal</i><br>
<i>&gt;UAV science demonstration, to provide an individual scientist with a flight</i><br>
<i>&gt;opportunity on an aircraft of choice.  This level of commitment is</i><br>
<i>&gt;inadequate.  The National Academy of Sciences has urged that there be a</i><br>
<i>&gt;sound balance between "in situ" and space-based observations in the Global</i><br>
<i>&gt;Climate Change Program.  Further, they have stated that "innovative</i><br>
<i>&gt;treatment of the nation's research aircraft capability, both piloted and</i><br>
<i>&gt;robotic is strongly advised."</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee urges NASA's Office of Earth Science to make a strategic</i><br>
<i>&gt;commitment to UAV platforms by devising a program that is structured to</i><br>
<i>&gt;create a business incentive for platform providers.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[p. 81]]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;In this regard, the Committee requests a report outlining NASA's five year</i><br>
<i>&gt;plan for UAVs as a scientific platform, including a projected budget profile</i><br>
<i>&gt;that is not confined within the existing manned aircraft budget.  In</i><br>
<i>&gt;particular, NASA should closely examine the alternative of leased services</i><br>
<i>&gt;or fractional ownership arrangements to meet these goals.  The Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt;requests this report by November 15, 1999 and expects NASA's fiscal year</i><br>
<i>&gt;2001 budget request to reflect this plan.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;AERO-SPACE TECHNOLOGY</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For Aero-space [[sic]] Technology, the Committee recommends the following</i><br>
<i>&gt;adjustment [[sic]] to the budget request:</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. An increase of $25,000,000 for Ultra Efficient Engine Technology.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. An increase of $1,800,000 for phase two of the synthetic vision</i><br>
<i>&gt;information system being tested at the Dallas-Ft. Worth Airport.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. An increase of $1,200,000 for continued support of the Dynamic Runway</i><br>
<i>&gt;Occupancy Measurement System demonstration at the Seattle-Tacoma Airport.</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. An increase of $2,000,000 to facilitate the acquisition of a 16 beam</i><br>
<i>&gt;SOCRATES system and integration of SOCRATES into the AVOSS program.</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. An increase of $5,000,000 for the Trailblazer program at the Glenn</i><br>
<i>&gt;Research Center.</i><br>
<i>&gt;6. An increase of $500,000 for the Institute for Software Research to</i><br>
<i>&gt;continue its collaborative effort with NASA-Dryden, focusing on adaptive</i><br>
<i>&gt;flight control research and fault tolerant systems.</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. An increase of $1,500,000 for the Software Optimization and Reuse</i><br>
<i>&gt;Technology Program.</i><br>
<i>&gt;8. An increase of $2,000,000 for the establishment of the NASA-Illinois</i><br>
<i>&gt;Technology Commercialization Center as an extension of the Midwest Regional</i><br>
<i>&gt;Technology Transfer Center, to be located at the DuPage County Research</i><br>
<i>&gt;Park.</i><br>
<i>&gt;9. An increase of $1,000,000 for the Florida Technological Research and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Development Authority to develop a technology-oriented business incubator in</i><br>
<i>&gt;Homestead, Florida.</i><br>
<i>&gt;10. An increase of $2,000,000 for the Earth Alert program for a test of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;system throughout the State of Maryland.</i><br>
<i>&gt;11. An increase of $1,500,000 for the National Technology Transfer Center,</i><br>
<i>&gt;to bring total funding for the center up to $7,200,00.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Last year the Committee noted its interest in the work being done for NASA</i><br>
<i>&gt;by the Schepens Eye Research Institute.  The Committee is aware that much of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the research being conducted by the Institute's Center of the Aging Eye may</i><br>
<i>&gt;be of use to NASA when astronauts begin to spend extended periods of time in</i><br>
<i>&gt;space.  With this in mind, the Committee directs NASA to provide a report</i><br>
<i>&gt;which addresses the research conducted by the Institute for NASA and further</i><br>
<i>&gt;opportunities for research.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee encourages NASA to work in coordination with the Department of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Energy and other interested federal agencies on an investigation of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;cavitative physics behind the patented Micro-Combustion Heat Engine</i><br>
<i>&gt;prototype technology developed by Micro-Combustion L.L.P.  The Committee is</i><br>
<i>&gt;encouraged by initial NASA investigations and believes this new technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;represents</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;[[p. 82]]</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;an energy breakthrough deserving of further study.  Understanding the</i><br>
<i>&gt;national security concerns associated with this technology, the Committee</i><br>
<i>&gt;requests NASA inform the Committee in writing, which respect to its</i><br>
<i>&gt;intentions, no later than January 30, 2000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee is aware of the unique closed system capabilities of Biosphere</i><br>
<i>&gt;2 Center, the earth system research facility located in Oracle, Arizona.</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee directs NASA, after consultation with Biosphere 2, to submit a</i><br>
<i>&gt;report to the Committee on Appropriations within 90 days of enactment of</i><br>
<i>&gt;this Act, that details potential partnerships between NASA and Biosphere 2</i><br>
<i>&gt;to enhance the research capabilities of NASA.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee is pleased to note that NASA has included in the budget</i><br>
<i>&gt;request $18,000,000 for the NASA-Ames Software Independent Verification and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Validation Facility in Fairmont, West Virginia.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee supports NASA's plan to transition the ERAST alliance into a</i><br>
<i>&gt;competitive process to meet its original ERAST objectives.  Further, the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Committee is aware of NASA's interest in reaching 100,000 feet using solar</i><br>
<i>&gt;power.  However, the Committee urges NASA to ensure that the project's</i><br>
<i>&gt;primary focus support technologies that will enable an operational unmanned</i><br>
<i>&gt;aerial vehicle (UAV) platform to meet the established science requirements</i><br>
<i>&gt;of the Office of Space Science.  In particular, NASA should support</i><br>
<i>&gt;over-the-horizon command-and-control protocols and work to ensure platform</i><br>
<i>&gt;integration within the national airspace system.  As NASA "down-selects" to</i><br>
<i>&gt;one consumable fuel UAV, the Committee believes NASA must ensure an</i><br>
<i>&gt;appropriate transition phase for other alliance partners.  Although the</i><br>
<i>&gt;change in direction of the ERAST program is warranted, the Committee urges</i><br>
<i>&gt;that the transition be implemented in such a manner that it not undermine</i><br>
<i>&gt;the viability of NASA's investment in the alliance member companies.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;ACADEMIC PROGRAMS</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;For Academic Programs, the Committee recommends the following adjustments to</i><br>
<i>&gt;the budget request:</i><br>
<i>&gt;1. An increase of $6,500,000 for the National Space Grant College and</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fellowship program, bringing the total funding for this program to</i><br>
<i>&gt;$19,100,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;2. An increase of $1,500,000 for the Franklin Institute for development of</i><br>
<i>&gt;an exhibit on astronomy.</i><br>
<i>&gt;3. An increase of $1,000,000 for the Sci-Quest, the North Alabama Science</i><br>
<i>&gt;Center.</i><br>
<i>&gt;4. An increase of $2,300,000 for the JASON Foundation's JASON XI expedition,</i><br>
<i>&gt;"Going to Extremes."</i><br>
<i>&gt;5. An increase of $1,000,000 for the Carl Sagan Discovery Center at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center.</i><br>
<i>&gt;6. An increase of $4,000,000 for the Texas Learning and Computational Center</i><br>
<i>&gt;at the University of Houston.</i><br>
<i>&gt;7. An increase of $5,000,000 for the Space Science Museum and Educational</i><br>
<i>&gt;Program at Downey, California.</i><br>
<i>&gt;8. An increase of $2,000,000 for the Ohio View Project.</i><br>
<i>&gt;9. An increase of $2,000,000 for continued academic and infrastructure needs</i><br>
<i>&gt;related to the computer sciences, mathematics and physics building at the</i><br>
<i>&gt;University of Redlands.</i><br>
<i>&gt;10. An increase of $1,000,000 for the NASA Minority University Research</i><br>
<i>&gt;Program to provide support for the establishment of a center of excellence</i><br>
<i>&gt;in Mathematics and Science at Texas College.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;MISSION SUPPORT</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 recommendation                            $2,269,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 1999 appropriation</i><br>
<i>&gt;2,511,100,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 budget request                                2,494,900,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 1999 appropriation      - 241,800,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 2000 request                 - 225,600,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The appropriation provides for mission support, including: safety,</i><br>
<i>&gt;reliability, and quality assurance activities supporting agency programs;</i><br>
<i>&gt;space communication services for NASA programs; salaries and related</i><br>
<i>&gt;expenses in support of research in NASA field installations; design, repair,</i><br>
<i>&gt;rehabilitation, and modification of institutional facilities and</i><br>
<i>&gt;construction of new institutional facilities; and other operational</i><br>
<i>&gt;activities supporting the conduct of agency programs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee recommends a total of $2,269,300,000 for the mission support</i><br>
<i>&gt;account.  The recommended amount is $241,800,000 below the fiscal year 1999</i><br>
<i>&gt;appropriation and $225,600,000 below the budget request.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee recommendation includes deferral of all Construction of</i><br>
<i>&gt;Facilities projects, to be accomplished at some future date.  This results</i><br>
<i>&gt;in a budget reduction of $67,100,000.  In addition, given the programmatic</i><br>
<i>&gt;changes directed in other NASA activities, personnel and related costs are</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduced by $100,000,000 and research and operations support funding is</i><br>
<i>&gt;reduced by $50,000,000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee continues its prohibition on the use of funds appropriated or</i><br>
<i>&gt;otherwise made available to the National Aeronautics and Space</i><br>
<i>&gt;Administration by this Act, or any other Act enacted before the date of</i><br>
<i>&gt;enactment of this Act, by the Administrator of NASA to relocate aircraft of</i><br>
<i>&gt;the National Aeronautics and Space Administration based east of the</i><br>
<i>&gt;Mississippi River to the Dryden Flight Research Center in California.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;OFFICE OF INSPECTOR GENERAL</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 recommendation                           $20,800,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 1999 appropriation                                  20,000,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Fiscal year 2000 budget request                               20,800,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 1999 appropriation       +800,000</i><br>
<i>&gt;Comparison with fiscal year 2000 request                               0</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Office of Inspector General was established by the Inspector General Act</i><br>
<i>&gt;of 1978 and is responsible for audit and investigation of all agency</i><br>
<i>&gt;programs.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The Committee recommends $20,800,000 for the Office on Inspector General in</i><br>
<i>&gt;fiscal year 2000, an increase of $800,000 to the amount provided in fiscal</i><br>
<i>&gt;year 1999 and the same as the budget request for fiscal year 2000.</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;ADMINISTRATIVE PROVISIONS</i><br>
<i>&gt;</i><br>
<i>&gt;The bill continues the current four administrative provisions as proposed in</i><br>
<i>&gt;the budget.  An additional administrative provision is included this year</i><br>
<i>&gt;which addresses the need for NASA to transition to full cost accounting.</i><br>
