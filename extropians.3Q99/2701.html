Its even worse in some cases.  Consider Bill &amp; Melinda Gates.
All that Microsoft stock sitting in their accounts, now you
wonder what would happen if they decided to sell all that stock?
Microsoft stock would plunge...  They are making people *rich*
by holding onto that stock.  If you don't have any Microsoft
stock, you're jealous of those who do, but if you do have some
Microsoft stock, you are happy to see them hold the stock getting
richer &amp; richer!

<p>
You have to wonder if the reason they are moving rapidly to create
the largest charitable organization in the world is because they
see the writing on the wall for Microsoft.  Between Open Source
and the government can it have much time left?  Better to sell now
and give yourself a job administering the largest charity in the
world than attempt to manage a company that past its prime...
The question is, does the market see it coming or are they
going to buy all that stock just before Microsoft does what
Oracle, Sun, Novell and IBM have all done one or more times?

<p>
Is Bill Gates more attached to being the president of Microsoft
or simply being the president of the biggest "something"?

<a name="2740qlink2">Ok, so my $$$ are issued by the Federal Reserve.  I don't think
the FR is getting an "interest-free-loan" from me because they
have a licence to print money.  Your statement sounds interesting
but I have a feeling one of us is missing something fundamental.
