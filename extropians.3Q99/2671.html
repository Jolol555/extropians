    hey, id give up gimps for something in which the shortterm gains were a 
little more obvious and interisting... yea, i know how that statement sounds, 
but i think that it epitomizes that attitudes of The Many (all those ppl with 
fast systems who use them for email, word processing, and the semi-occasional 
quake game, yet leave their systems on all for a large amount of time).
<p>
    a nice fractal landscape generator might be just the thing... or at 
least, something nice and visually stimulating. if every [large period of 
time] high quality, very trippy looking new wallpapers appeared on the users 
desktop (would this be too invasive? and yes, im thinkin windoze, cuz thats 
the majority platform), the project might be a little more popular then, say, 
gimps... just cuz gimps isnt very pretty.
<p>
    gimps user: "whoohoo, im on iteration 432000 of 654111. gee, ive done a 
lot of iterations. i am truly special because of this, albiet in a very 
abstract kind of way"...
<p>
    emlynproj user: "wow, how long has that wallpaper been there? hmmm... 
what is it? it looks like it could be, in a very surreal way, symbolizing the 
eternal war between the sexes, or something... hey, forest, pass the bowl, 
man..."

<p>
hehe no insult intended to those who smoke, or to those who think fractal 
based abstract art can really symbolize anything, even though perhaps some 
insults should be intended towards some of those ppl who so blatantly 
overinfer,
