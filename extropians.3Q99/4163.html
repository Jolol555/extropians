*New Microscopy Method Reveals Molecular Map of Biological Surfaces.Using<br>
modern microscopy tools, scientists have been able to look at the molecules
and molecular structures on viruses, cell walls and other biological
surfaces, but they haven't had any way of knowing what those molecules
actually are. Molecular microscopy techniques have been "chemically blind"-
until now. (new method of AFM) The technique can potentially be used for
nanometer-scale mapping of biomolecules.

*Virtual identity game attracts academics and Web users<br>
Interacting online with people from throughout the world is a daily
occurrence for millions of Internet users, yet most do it with little
perspective on the virtual identity they are projecting. Now a multiplayer
online game created by researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology is
offering insight to virtual community designers and members.

*Knowledge-Centered Awards Jump Start NSF Focus on I.T. for the 21st Century<br>
The National Science Foundation (NSF) this week awarded $50 million in
grants for broad-based research in knowledge and distributed intelligence
(KDI). The awards are for projects as varied as knowledge networking in
biocomplexity, earthquake computer modeling and case studies in intellectual
property.   <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/press/99/pr9950.htm">http://www.nsf.gov/od/lpa/news/press/99/pr9950.htm</a>

about 5 billion years ago.

*Optical Technique Used to Map 3-Mb Genome of Radiation-Resistant Superbug<br>
The completion of a whole-genome map for the bacterium Deinococcus
radiodurans was reported in the September 9 issue of Science (requires
subscription). The new map was constructed via an optical mapping approach
that uses fluorescence microscopy to view individual, elongated DNA
molecules cut by restriction enzymes. Advantages of this approach are that
it provides a useful picture of the basic organization of an entire genome,
and it eliminates the need for constructing large numbers of clones.

*Globalstar, a satellite phone firm, is close to an agreement with federal<br>
law enforcement officials who had threatened to delay its service if the FBI
couldn't wiretap phone conversations. Even though the company is based in
Canada, it needs to win approval from the Federal Communications Commission,
which has already held up a license for another company due to concerns that
the FBI would not be able to wiretap and monitor its service.
