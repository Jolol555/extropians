On a personal level, I think I'd characterize my strategy as more one of 
surfing than sipping.

<a name="3762qlink1">Seriously, when I'm acting as a mentor (the frequency of which seems to be in 
direct disproportion to the amount of hair I have left),<a name="3677qlink1"> I often tell young 
people to think about surfing as a fruitful metaphor for how to approach a 
career: To be a good surfer, it seems you need three things: (1) to know how 
to surf; (2) a surfboard and (3) a wave.</a>  In the regime of career planning, 
this means you need to have (1) basic people and basic business and/or 
technical skills and knowledge; (2) some realistic business or technical plan 
or opportunity and (3) the social context in which (1) and (2) are 
sufficiently useful to a sufficient number of people that you'll get paid to 
do what you'd like to do.  I usually use this metaphor to counsel patient 
preparation and the amassing of skills, along with watchfulness for good 
opportunities and over-all trends, often saying that good surfers sometimes 
just park their boards on the beach and have a beer when there aren't any 
good waves, but stay ready in case they see a Big One starting to rise.

<a name="3549qlink1">But the notion of "the Singularity" (strong or weak, fast or slow, swell or 
Spike) gives a new meaning to this metaphor.<a name="3546qlink1">  In the surfing image, we're 
talking about the Mother of All Waves.  Surfing that wave may be the only 
possible way to survive it.  I think of this list as a kind</a> of beach party, 
<a name="3546qlink2">where we're all looking out and waiting for the cry "Surf's up!"</a>
