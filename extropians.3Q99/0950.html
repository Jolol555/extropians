Yes, I know.  There are people who disbelieve in psychic powers because
said powers are "unscientific", the same kind of people who are willing
to suppress their own mistakes because they don't want to give psychics
"ammunition".  I'm talking specifically about James Randi, CSICOP, and
the infamous sTARBABY fiasco.

<p>
That's not why I disbelieve in psychic powers; I disbelieve in them
because nobody's done anything useful with the concept.  I believe in
science, not because it's rational or logical or otherwise morally good,
but because science works.  It produces socks, electric motors and
nuclear weapons.  Psychic powers don't work because psychics don't win
the lottery.  QED.

<p>
And I don't.  (I doubt Lee Crocker does either.)  I simply use the
minimum number of tentative differentials - statements of the form "A is
more probable than B" - that I need to choose between actions.
