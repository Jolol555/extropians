I wish you success in that endeavor!

I'm also serious, BTW, in helping to pitch stories about cryonics to the
media.  One of the aspects of media coverage on cryonics has had somewhat
reactionary tone--the producers of a show think up their story idea and go
find someone who wants to be frozen to say a few words.  That person has
very little control over how they are portrayed.  We could easily elevate
the tone of that portrayal by proactively approaching producers with a
specific story idea and background information.

I haven't tackled it before, because the LES in my area got a five-page
cover story in the City Paper, which is widely read, and they did a good
job of convincing the reporter to dig a little deeper.  The story was
written in a lighthearted and yet informative tone, and it has a wonderful
front page shot of then-president, Mark Mugler, lying in the temporary
cooling bin.  More of that sort of coverage would only help, and I could
mail a copy of it to anyone who wants to see it.
