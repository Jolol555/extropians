<a name="4254qlink1">What questions do you have in particular? Since you're doing it for
biology.. you probably want to know about the biological basis of violence,
right?
<br>
<a name="4250qlink1">One interesting thing I can tell you is to look into the amygdala (I think I
spelled it right).</a> They have done experiements where they stimulated the
</a>
amygdala of normal patients, who would then become very violent. I remember
the description of it in biopsychology class - this girl was playing a
guitar, and they stimulated her amygdala, and she started smashing the
guitar. I can't name a source off the top of my head - but look up
"amygdala" in any intro psychology book, or maybe a biopsychology book. The
amygdala is in the brain, by the way.

Subject: violence...


<p>
<a href="4243.html#4246qlink1">&gt;I've that my biology teacher recently told us to</a><br>
<i>&gt;pursue some particular world problem-pollution,</i><br>
<i>&gt;overpopulation, etc., etc.  My chosen problem to</i><br>
<i>&gt;confront, however, was violent behavior.  While many</i><br>
<i>&gt;other subjects are interesting, I'd already done them.</i><br>
<i>&gt;And done them. Ad nauseum.  What I was thinking is</i><br>
<i>&gt;that since your all in the business of answering tough</i><br>
<i>&gt;questions (been on the list for at least a few months)</i><br>
<i>&gt;I was wondering if you could provide me with opinion,</i><br>
<i>&gt;commentary, et al., but most importantly, NUMBERS! I</i><br>
<i>&gt;was hoping you could lead me to some interesting</i><br>
<i>&gt;studies on the subject... I would like source</i><br>
<i>&gt;information as well.  Any help would be appreciated.</i><br>
<i>&gt;Besides, if I get enough information, we might get</i><br>
<i>&gt;another person on the list- Mr. Brosius seemed kind of</i><br>
<i>&gt;interested in all of us.  I would be very priviledged</i><br>
<i>&gt;to consider myself one of you anyway- I am not yet</i><br>
<i>&gt;involved, per se, but I'm working towards technology</i><br>
<i>&gt;and science as a major focus on future careers.  I</i><br>
<i>&gt;would be glad to receive any help and information on</i><br>
<i>&gt;the causes (and methods of reducing) violence as</i><br>
<i>&gt;possible.</i><br>
