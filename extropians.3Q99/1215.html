<a name="1223qlink5">If they are that rare, and given the relatively young age</a> of our universe, this

speck in a speck.  And if inflationary theorists are right, then our
observable universe might be as small as a 1/10^30th of the actual
Universe. Now that's a speck within a speck within a speck if I have
every heard one.</a> :-)
