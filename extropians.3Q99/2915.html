You may want to read the section on nanotech that resides in the
Transhumanist FAQ on the WTA web site.  

<p>
To some extent, there may not be much you can do.  Nanotech is one of those
ideas that takes a period of adjustment to get used to, and springing it on
someone totally unfamiliar with techie ideas can jolt someone.  Some of its
<a name="2924qlink2">ramifications are quite 'scary', in that they compel you to move out of a
comfortable structure of thought into something untested and open-ended.</a>
<a name="2924qlink3">That is one of the reasons it might be good to present general
transhumanist ideas first, to provide a basis of reference, then get into
nanotech.</a>
