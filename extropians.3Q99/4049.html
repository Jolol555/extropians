Ja, I think you got it right. I suspect Rush started out as an entertainer,
developed a following, realized these people were pretty serious
about that which he originally developed as entertainment, then
asked himself the question, well, why not?  I need a job, these
yahoos need a leader, why not me?  I cant say I blame him.
There are plenty of examples of people who enter a philosophical
marriage of convenience.  Not saying it is for me, but given the
choice between the night shift at Denny's or a wildly popular
and controversial radio personality....  {8^D  spike
