You are right, I have considerable trouble with it.  But it's a lot less 
<br>
evil that sending in an army with the mass destruction that is thereby 
<br>
entailed.  If we have an obligation to get rid of some particularly vile 
<br>
person, getting rid of anyone who live on the same block has got to be 
<br>
considered much worse than merely getting him killed.
<br>
<p>Also, you are acting as if Bush was leading the charge and exposing 
<br>
himself to danger.  That is so far from accurate that I have trouble 
<br>
understanding it, but I think that's where &quot;do your dirty work&quot; has to 
<br>
be coming from.  Now, personally I have no trouble about hiring a 
<br>
plumber to fix my toilet.  I know that I don't have skills honed in that 
<br>
area.  But you probably mean something different.  Those who decided on 
<br>
the war are taking every care to ensure that they, themselves, are never 
<br>
threatened, and that eliminates most readings of your words.  So I'm 
<br>
left confused as to where you are coming from.
