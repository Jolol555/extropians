<em>&gt; World and America watching different wars

<em>&gt; CNN vs. Al Jazeera: Seeing is often believing
</em><br>
<p>There is at least one US news source that seems to be giving a more balanced
<br>
picture of what's going on:
<br>
<p>=============================
<br>
<p>Democracy Now! is a national, listener-sponsored public radio and TV show,
<br>
pioneering the largest community media collaboration in the country. The
<br>
program was launched six years ago as the only daily election show in public
<br>
broadcasting. Because of its success, Democracy Now! broadened its focus and
<br>
became a national news show committed to bringing the voices of the
<br>
marginalized to the airwaves on issues ranging from the global to the local.
<br>
<p>==============================
<br>
<p>You can listen to their unembedded reporters online:

<br>
<p>Meanwhile, Lee Corbin seems to be offended because Damien Broderick posted a
<br>
link to a news story that contained reports of Iraqi casualties. I would not
<br>
presume to tell Lee or anyone else what their political opinions should be;
<br>
but when one forms his opinions with blinders on, I think it's safe to say
<br>
that his opinions are probably not consistent with reality.
