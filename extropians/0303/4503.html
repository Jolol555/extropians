</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well that certainly seems to be the general attitude of most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Americans, then and now.  Who cares?  They aren't people, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why exaggerate the attitudes of those you disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with?  After all, you have *plenty* of good points
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the following. 
</em><br>
<p>I would retort to Matus that this attitude seems, rather, to be the
<br>
attitude of the French and Germans now. Screw the Iraqi people, right?
<br>
Who cares if they want democracy? They aren't French or Germans, so
<br>
they aren't people, right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Never mind that millions of Indochinese people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slaughtered and enslaved.  They weren't Americans, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; didnt know any of them, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not the reason that so many liberals can't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excited about them, and prefer never to think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what happened there.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The Iraqis aren't French or German, and the only Iraqis any French or
<br>
German people know are jackbooted thugs in Saddam's regime that French
<br>
and German companies are doing deals with, so who cares about the Iraqi
<br>
on the street? They are obviously beneath contempt for letting such
<br>
jackals rule them, they must be the sort that NEED to be ruled with an
<br>
iron fist, like we French did in Indochina and Algeria, like we Germans
<br>
did wherever we could get away with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real reason is that to bring all that up does nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to criticize the great Imperialist power, the U.S.  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would exposing real crimes of Saddam's regime, or China's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the other Communist regimes help deflate the U.S.?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As some (a few, granted) on this list have actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; described it, the &quot;most genocidal nation in history&quot;, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one currently ruled by &quot;inhuman paranoid and future war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminals&quot;, what matters is only whether or not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influence of the United States is curtailed or not.
</em><br>
<p>Funny how those who are most opposed to a preemption policy seem so
<br>
willing to use such a policy against we alleged 'future war criminals'
<br>
here in the US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, why not?  Well, I will tell you why not.  Because taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over Ruwanda to suppress genocide would not in any way advance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the interests of the U.S. in the world situation.  Therefore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be unobjectionable!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was recessed from this list when Clinton invaded Bosnia.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Were the same usual suspects making a fuss then?  (I really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would like to know, thanks.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes, they were making a fuss, and exaggerating anything the US did and
<br>
completely misconstruing the Geneva Conventions which they have never
<br>
seemed to have read, then or now.
