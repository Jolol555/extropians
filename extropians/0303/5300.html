<p>
Hubert,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We all ready know that you dont like the war, so perhaps instead of posting
<br>
these long diatrabes and desciptions of your previous days lunch's you could
<br>
just say 'I dont like the war'.  When you realize that you would end up with
<br>
multiple posts each day that simple say 'I dont like the war' you will see
<br>
why your arguments are getting your opinion no where.  We know you dont like
<br>
the war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you cannot understand that I am against the US/UK troops *and* against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam Hussein at the same time
</em><br>
<p>You pay lip service to disliking Saddam, but have presented no evidence
<br>
indicating as much.  If you dislike him so much, then why the concentrated
<br>
effort to dissuade people from voluntarily choosing to oust him?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but what can be more tasteless than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this current war on Iraq?
</em><br>
<p>Here you find an essential dividing point between you and us.  Those who
<br>
support this war see it as more tasteless to leave a murderous dictator in
<br>
power than it would be to remove him.  As Robert Bradbury pointed out,
<br>
leaving Saddam in power will cause more deaths of Iraqi people then taking
<br>
him out of power.  He asked anyone to present a reasonable challenge to that
<br>
notion, and received no responses as of yet.  A few months back another
<br>
poster presented an eloquent list of the reasons why extropians should want
<br>
Saddam removed.
<br>
<p>We do not support war because we like to see people die, or get our jollies
<br>
off of watching bombs fall in Iraq, and until you understand the reasons
<br>
*why* those of us who actually support this effort support it, and address
<br>
those points, your comments will not persuade anyone.
<br>
<p>For starters, in no particular order
<br>
<p>1) Saddam is a murderous tyrant dictator, his Anfal campaign was a
<br>
systemetic attempt to wipe out the Kurdish population (aka genocide)
<br>
conservative estimates has him responsible for 200,000 murders, 50,000 of
<br>
which were perpetrated when he squashed the Shiite majority uprising post
<br>
Gulf War I
<br>
<p>2) UN Security resolution 1441, signed as a unanimous vote in the UN,
<br>
dictates that he should disarm peacefully and immediately and expose all
<br>
previously discovered chemical, biological weapons and delivery systems.  If
<br>
he did not, he would face 'serious consequences'
<br>
<p>3) From an American perspective, Saddam poses a threat to the American
<br>
People.  9/11 demonstrated the domestic American vunlerabilities, that small
<br>
parties can inflict large casualties.  We need not see an IRAQI battleship
<br>
cruising up the Hudson to consider Saddam an immediate and direct threat,
<br>
which leads into the next one
<br>
<p>4) Saddam is a despotic west hating tyrant, and it is reasonable to suspect
<br>
that if he gets the capability to attack the US, he will.  He has been
<br>
actively trying to acquire nuclear weapons, attempted to build an artillery
<br>
cannon capable of launching projectiles into orbit.
<br>
<p>5) Saddam controls the worlds second largest energy supply, and as a
<br>
murderous tyrant, uses it for, surprise, murder and tyranny.
<br>
<p>6) There are no Arab Democracies, and a democratic IRAQ could potentially
<br>
become a 'shinning beacon of democracy in an arab sea of tyranny, oppresion,
<br>
and despair'  When arab peoples see the life that can be lived in a free
<br>
Arab nation, it can help to diffuse the anti-west hatred and anti-progress
<br>
attitude that many arab theocracies, monarchies, and dictators have imposed
<br>
upon their people.  (Optimistic admittedly, but everyone is so pessimestic,
<br>
its nice to have a little optimism)
<br>
<p>There are many other reasons to support the effort to remove Saddam Hussain
<br>
from power, but unless you address and/or invalidate these points (or
<br>
whatever other ones other supporters have) you will not change any ones
<br>
minds.  So I guess it boils down to what your goal is, reminding everyone
<br>
that you dont like the war, or trying to change other peoples minds about
<br>
it.  We know you dont like the war, so dispense with your creative efforts
<br>
at saying as much, and just post 'I dont like the war'  Pointing out to
<br>
supporters the dismay that the Iraqi people undergo dissuades no supports
<br>
because they believe, legitamtely, the more suffering will be caused by
<br>
inaction than by action.
<br>
<p>Additionally, no one has a *right* to be a Dictator, and that is what Saddam
<br>
was.  He could have walked away and saved all of the causalties and deaths
<br>
now caused.  He is morally culpable now for each and every death this War
<br>
causes, simply because he wanted to remain a murderous dictator.
<br>
