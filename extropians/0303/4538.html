<p>
My wife subscribes to Men's Health magazine, and in the April 2003 issue
<br>
there is a pretty good article on Alcor, titled Ted Williams Sleeps Here.
<br>
One oddity is that the author is listed as Michael Perry, which I think
<br>
happens to be the name of an Alcor employee, however the article is
<br>
written in a style which does not suggest any previous acquaintance
<br>
with cryonics.  So I guess this name similarity is just a coincidence.
<br>
<p>The overall tone of the article is breezy and somewhat irreverent, but
<br>
reasonably positive.  The author goes on a tour of Alcor's Scottsdale
<br>
facility, sees the operating room and storage facilities, talks to
<br>
Jerry Lemler, president of Alcor, and Bill Haworth, P.R. consultant.
<br>
Of course Alcor cannot confirm that Ted Williams is suspended there, but
<br>
the author assumes it is so.  &quot;Ted's in there, I think.  Ted.  In a tank.&quot;
<br>
<p>He also interviews some skeptics: Aby J. Mathew, director of hypothermic
<br>
preservation services for BioLife Solutions.  &quot;It would not be correct for
<br>
us to say it's crazy,&quot; he says.  &quot;And we would not necessarily discount
<br>
the possibility that if we preserve people now, future technologies may
<br>
be able to resuscitate and regenerate them.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also, Michael Shermer, publisher of Skeptic magazine and columnist for
<br>
Scientific American: &quot;Even if they find a way to repair the cellular
<br>
damage, no one has any clue how to restart the motor, other than
<br>
a Frankensteinian thing where you just electrocute it and see what
<br>
happens.&quot;  (That strikes me as a peculiar objection, I haven't heard
<br>
that one before.)
<br>
<p>Shermer goes on more favorably: &quot;Most of the practitioners are realistic
<br>
about the probability of working.  It's not like these are cranks scamming
<br>
people out of a lot of money.  They're not.&quot;  And asked if he'd accept
<br>
a free suspension: &quot;I guess if they'd give me a free freeze, I'd go
<br>
for it.  I hear they offered one to Isaac Asimov and he turned it down.
<br>
I wouldn't turn down a free freeze.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's about it for skeptical commentary.  No &quot;hamburger into cow&quot;
<br>
or claims of fraud.  Even the skeptics admit that it could work, and
<br>
Shermer would even consider being frozen.  And the author concludes:
<br>
<p>&quot;But I'm over the idea of cryonics as some sort of creepy secret.
<br>
Dunking someone in liquid nitrogen isn't really any stranger than the
<br>
other socially acceptable things we do with the dead.  Seems to me that
<br>
Alcor's clients are simply operating on the theory that they have nothing
<br>
to lose.  They're buying a $120,000 lottery ticket.&quot;
<br>
