Damien Sullivan (welcome back Damien!!) writes

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why is it that liberals are for the most part unable to admit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the old major network coverage, ABC, NBC, and CBS, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a liberal bias?  Why does some CBS insider like Bernard Goldberg
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's because they completely disagree that mainstream media has a liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bias.  Coverage of Clinton and Gore, coverage (or lack) of the WTO and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; globalization issues... they don't see liberal bias.  They see corporate bias.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They don't watch TV and think &quot;ah!  these people are saying what I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Could be.  I'll try to keep that in mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I have two theories.  One is that some liberals so deeply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; question the legitimacy of conservative views that by fiat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; all such views are &quot;right wing extremist&quot; and hence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negligible, no matter how often people like Reagan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or the Bushes are elected to high office. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Do Reagan and the bushes acknowledge the legitimacy of liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views?  Bush the Younger who seems to be on a personal crusade,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Bush the elder who said atheists couldn't be good American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens?
</em><br>
<p>Are you kidding?  Of course not.  They're politicians.  To them,
<br>
the opposition isn't to be hated; it's merely the total and
<br>
conscious Opposition.  They don't think anything like normal
<br>
people at all.
<br>
<p>I'm trying to unearth psychological differences between normal
<br>
left leaning people and normal right leaning people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; My other theory is that the left has inherited a tradition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or aspects of a tradition, that goes all the way back to Lenin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In revolutionary Russia, Lenin and his followers labeled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves the Bolsheviks, or &quot;Majority&quot;.  It was a conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lenin is not part of the memetic history of most US liberals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really, he's not.
</em><br>
<p>Here is why I think Lenin is.  Remember: unlike the far right,
<br>
which was totally crushed in 1945, the far left was never totally
<br>
repudiated.  Observe who the sponsors and organizers of the world-
<br>
wide recent peace protests are.  At every turn you find old
<br>
Communist organizations at the forefront, no matter how many
<br>
non-Communist liberals are attracted to the marches.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There may be some common roots between Lenis and social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy, going back to the first people outraged at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condition of the poor in the 19th century, but that's it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This &quot;Bolshevik&quot; connection is a fantasy.
</em><br>
<p>It's not.  In terms of memes, organization, strategy, and
<br>
outlook, they're heirs of Lenin.  You can follow the very
<br>
clear evolution of all the memes, slogans, and phrases
<br>
from &quot;People's This&quot; to &quot;People's That&quot;, right down to 
<br>
&quot;Concerned Citizens for This&quot;, &quot;Concerned Citizens for That&quot;.
<br>
The path leading from Vladimir Lenin to Noam Chomsky couldn't
<br>
be clearer.  Now, I repeat again:  hardly any of the left-leaning
<br>
today, of course, tolerate a huge number of practices, assumptions,
<br>
and many of the methods used by the Old Left---but the New Left
<br>
has its roots in them, that's for sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Ever since, many on the left appear to believe that they possess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a special dispensation from God or someone to have pre-eminence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in political matters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the right doesn't have this?
</em><br>
<p>Not in quite the same way.  I'm excluding the shrill voices
<br>
you're liable to pick up on the airwaves these days, from the
<br>
right, and I'm excluding the religious types who really do
<br>
believe that God's on their side.  I'm focusing on a large
<br>
number of people (including Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather,
<br>
and journalists beyond counting) who for forty years would
<br>
not admit the liberal bias of the American media.  Now how
<br>
am I supposed to explain that?  Except to posit that at some
<br>
level in their minds, voices of those such as Barry Goldwater
<br>
or William Buckley are not legitimate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd say the religious right does think it has a dispensation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from God, pretty literally speaking.  Ten Commandments in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; courthouse, anti-sodomy law in Texas...
</em><br>
<p>Exactly so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm once again amazed at how allegedly libertarian Extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; band together behind a secretive President who's been attacking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civil liberties right and left and is allied with evangelicals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who look forward to the 2nd coming and the end of the world.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, there's a war on, you know.  These infringements that 
<br>
to many on this list signify the end of liberal democracy
<br>
as we know it were prompted by 9-11 exactly as former
<br>
infringements were caused by Pearl Harbor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Vladimir Lenin!  That they could embrace such a fantastical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; notion that their views were nearly by definition *correct*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; only bespeaks the degree to which this special dispensation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is and was entertained by them. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That you think any such belief in correctness is primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited to the left seems fantastical in itself.  And from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I've seen of recent history, American liberals have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been almost hobbled by their own doubt, vs. the coherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-righteousness on the right.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you are making good points here.  But you will
<br>
note the asymmetry.  There is no way that &quot;young conservatives&quot;
<br>
or whatever could have ever evolved the &quot;Political Correctness&quot;
<br>
viewpoint.  Inconceivable.
<br>
<p>Yet the self-doubt of liberals is a reality.  It comes from a
<br>
number of sources.  The fall of communism is the biggest one,
<br>
because although extreme, it was an encapsulation of the socialist
<br>
dream, and to fully understand now exactly how bankrupt it was
<br>
is a numbing blow.
<br>
<p>Secondly, the pendulum has started to swing back in terms of
<br>
a number of assumptions animating 20th century liberalism.
<br>
The incorrect anthropology of Franz Boas and Margaret Mead
<br>
(themselves a understandable reaction against even earlier
<br>
errors when the pendulum was way the other way) is slowly,
<br>
very slowly, being exposed for what it is.
<br>
<p>Thirdly, the failed American utopian experiments of the &quot;War
<br>
on Poverty&quot;, and the failures of so many other social programs
<br>
has left people unsure of how to use government power to 
<br>
achieve social ends.  Where to turn now?  Exactly the degree
<br>
to which Europe clings to socialist solutions is precisely
<br>
the degree to which those otherwise hardworking and advanced
<br>
countries lag, and seem determined to lag, the United States.
<br>
<p>And finally the advent of the strident right wing voices
<br>
themselves---silenced and denied a forum between 1960
<br>
and 1990---is something that liberals are having a hard
<br>
time getting used to.  The comfortable good old days of
<br>
monopoly are gone, everywhere except at most universities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not that there aren't those full of conviction on the left.  But I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'liberal' and 'left' are wholly synonymous, just as 'conservative' and 'right'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't either... isolationist and small-government conservatives have little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with the neocons dreaming of Pax Americana.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  You're quite right.  It's very difficult in short essays
<br>
here to address the full complexity.
<br>
