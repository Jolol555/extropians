<p>I personally think the most extropic thing extropians could do in regards to
<br>
the obesity 'problem' is to create a simple, inexpensive, and attractive
<br>
manner for the average person to easily overcome their obesity problem.
<br>
This has all-ready been solved in concept in a suggestion I saw another list
<br>
member make, I believe it was Spike but I am not positive.  Anyhow, a simple
<br>
device, an implant in the abdomen or so, that would process carbohydrates
<br>
into h20 and co2.  Most of the bodies processes work on diffusion so the
<br>
mere fact that such an implanted device would create an excess of CO2 and a
<br>
deficit of carbohydrates would likely facilitate a successful integration of
<br>
such a device into the body with little beyond its self contained components
<br>
necessary.  Such a device could be devised to 'burn' 100 - 200 calories per
<br>
day, over any significant length of time this would cure the 'obesity'
<br>
problem, allow people to eat pretty much whatever they want, and be thin and
<br>
healthy.  We Eat to much because we are genetically inclined to indulge in
<br>
times of scarcity but have no mechanism to restrict ourselves in times of
<br>
excess.  Coming up with a scientific and technical solution to a 'problem'
<br>
that technology (through food abundance) caused is the epitome of an
<br>
extropic effort.  
<br>
<p>A cheap, simple implant anyone could get.  Ideally, it would be even better
<br>
if such a device could power external electronic devices.  
<br>
<p>I found this idea quite fascinating when it was proposed on this list a few
<br>
months back, it didn't seem to generate much interest, but it's a great idea
<br>
IMHO.  In my own limited research into the topic I found a class of fuel
<br>
cells called 'Microbial Fuel Cells' which do just this, and they are being
<br>
researched to power robots called 'Gastrobots' since they function on a
<br>
'stomach'  
<br>
<p>There are a heck of a lot of intelligent electrical engineering, physics,
<br>
and chemistry people on this list, perhaps a calloborative effort could
<br>
bring such a device into existence.
