<p>&quot;Nixon was a lunatic.  He was paranoid, delusional, anti-semitic,
<br>
and otherwise off his rocker.&quot;
<br>
<p>Tell us what you really think, Lee....:) I must of course wholeheartedly 
<br>
disagree with your diagnosis, Doctor. Nixon's passion, his foreign policy, 
<br>
was more grounded in reality than any other President of the 20th Century 
<br>
with the possible exception of TR. He was a man grounded in the real world, 
<br>
and that was something that the American public could never fully embrace or 
<br>
love. Quips such as &quot;I feel your pain&quot; or &quot;It's the economy, stupid&quot; are fine 
<br>
and dandy and help make one &quot;cool&quot;, but they don't they do a damn thing about 
<br>
international terrorism, for example.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In regard to Nixon's anti-semitism, let us not live in a box of our own 
<br>
current sensibilities and pretend these attitudes were not prevalent during 
<br>
that era, please. Truman's disparaging of Jews, much like Kennedy's of Afric
<br>
ans, is well known. And as Leonard Garment, Christopher Matthews, and others 
<br>
have illustrated, Nixon's disdain for the American Jewry probably had more to 
<br>
do with the fact that they voted 90% against him than anything else. Finally 
<br>
on this topic, people need to let actions speak louder than words. President 
<br>
Nixon (against public and media opinion, I might add) ordered a massive 
<br>
airlift to the Israelis that saved them from certain defeat in the Yom Kippur 
<br>
War in 1973. Then Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir said afterword, &quot;God 
<br>
Bless President Nixon.&quot; I highly doubt anyone on this list's track record in 
<br>
regard to helping the Jewish people is as laudable, regardless of their 
<br>
personal feelings and or &quot;high language&quot; they may use in regard to the Jewish 
<br>
people.  
<br>
<p>&quot;His administration did do a pretty
<br>
good job of hiding his illness, and he probably never slept with
<br>
his sister, so I agree that Caligula probably had one up on him,
<br>
but not by much.&quot;
<br>
<p>No, but Nixon had two brothers that died of tuberculosis when he was not even 
<br>
a teenager, and rose from poverty to become the leader of the free world. 
<br>
Usually a story that we would celebrate in this country, but not in the cases 
<br>
of &quot;lunatics&quot;, eh Lee? Perhaps you would like to illustrate &quot;Caligula, Mad 
<br>
Emperor of Rome&quot;'s outstanding accomplishments as head of state, so that we 
<br>
might compare them to the accomplishments of President Nixon, unless you 
<br>
consider &quot;sleeping with one's sister&quot; to be of a higher value than 
<br>
rapproachment with the Chinese. If not, then let us attempt to engage in 
<br>
serious discussion, rather than &quot;Nixon the mad tyrant, loonie toon, weren't 
<br>
the North Vietnamese so nice to everyone, he almost doomed the American way 
<br>
of life&quot; stereotypes of an earlier generation.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's pretty amazing that he did manage to do some good things.&quot;
<br>
<p>Given the track record of most presidents, I wholeheartedly agree with you.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
