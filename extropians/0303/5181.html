[Bleak downcast confession: I run the risk of treading old familiar ground 
<br>
to the Bayesians here, but it's either that or dredging for W*R news, and 
<br>
for the moment I choose the former. Bayes, forgive me, for I have sinned.]

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This bugs me, and statements of this sort have always bugged me. I think 
<br>
I'm wary of it as a possible misapplication of what is often called &quot;the 
<br>
law of large numbers&quot;.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that saying things like &quot;we should&quot; rather than something 
<br>
more like &quot;out of /x/ trials, a civilization was seen in /y/ cases to 
<br>
possess property /w/, with a variation /z/ across trial sets, suggesting 
<br>
probability P&quot; is a huge palming-of-a-card, possibly itself in a quasi- 
<br>
anthropic way. Akin to the claim (a loaded one, but easy to come by) that 
<br>
because x-ethnicity is usually in jail, I &quot;ought to be&quot; in jail because I 
<br>
am x-ethnicity. I mean, it (getting to &quot;we/I should&quot;) *is* apparently the 
<br>
evolutionary-biology explanation for why we *like* odds so much, but that 
<br>
doesn't make it _true_.
<br>
<p>On momentary reflection about my objection, it also seems to me to, 
<br>
vaguely, relate to the gambler's fallacy. But I'm not sure I can put my 
<br>
finger on why, just now.
<br>
<p>We don't have a huge set of observations/trials (monte carlo or otherwise) 
<br>
of something like our-civilization-being-instantiated, or more to the point 
<br>
&quot;our-individual-beings-being-instantiated&quot; to go on. We have a theory (a 
<br>
notion, actually), and the ability to create a formula and do algebra, and 
<br>
one data point. &quot;HEY! I got the THREE OF CLUBS! The odds of that are 52 to 
<br>
1! Wow, how unlikely!&quot;
<br>
<p>I mean to say, what if 51 of the kinds of civilizations that might exist 
<br>
don't look anything like ours, or each other?--as one possibility only. Or 
<br>
what if we *are* a &quot;big&quot; civilization? Seems like a pretty plain variation 
<br>
on the old Drake equation--either the combinatorics create a dinky number, 
<br>
or the model is incomplete, or the observations are missing something, or 
<br>
some combination of factors. In which case it's old news--Fermi's &quot;Where 
<br>
are they?&quot; in a different t-shirt.
<br>
<p>Perhaps I'm just a lazy thinker. Perhaps my gray-to-white-matter ratio will 
<br>
never permit me to apprehend this sort of thinking deeply enough to accept 
<br>
it as truth. At present, though I can entertain it, it just makes my 
<br>
bogometer needle wander into the yellow zone, rather near where many 
<br>
people's retreats to commitment do. &quot;If I were a dog, I'd hate it, because 
<br>
I'd chase sticks. And I hate chasing sticks.&quot;
<br>
<p>Am I making any sense here?
<br>
<p>I'll try to think more about it. &quot;Help thou my unbelief.&quot;
<br>
