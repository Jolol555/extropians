<em>&gt; &gt;Okay, let me get this straight: PAII proposes to make the use of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; How will you know whether or not your are committing a felony?  I, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally, know less than 1% of the laws on the books, and those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only in a popularized form.  And I don't know how much less than one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percent, but I do know that it decreases with every law that gets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed.
</em><br>
<p>A responsible citizen should be aware of the laws in their
<br>
jurisdiction. While there are many small statutory violations which it
<br>
is difficult to avoid these days, such are not generally felonies.
<br>
Whistling and chewing gum at the same time may get you a citation in
<br>
some communities (not kidding), but such generally are not felonies.
<br>
<p>A person generally knows when they are committing a felony. Felony laws
<br>
are generally not swept under the rug, so trying to claim ignorance is
<br>
a bit facetious. Somebody always makes a stink about ones that people
<br>
find onerous, and the police/lawyer tv shows always try to make use of
<br>
different ones just to keep their programs fresh. You'd have to be
<br>
living under a rock for a decade or more to be ignorant of many such
<br>
laws.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I generally try to obey all the laws that I know and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand.  But I am well aware that it is ... less than 1% ... so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would only issue a &quot;so don't commit a crime&quot; comment as a form of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sarcasm.  But that doesn't seem to be what you are doing.
</em><br>
<p>Only in part. For example, the bit about using a tone generator while
<br>
committing theft of communications services. If you follow the
<br>
arguments of those who oppose IP laws, laws should not restrict
<br>
behavior which is cheap to commit (i.e. copying intellectual property
<br>
electronically). According to this logic, it should not be illegal to
<br>
use a modified phone dialer tone generator (available at Radio Shack)
<br>
to get free phone calls at payphones, simply because it is so easy and
<br>
cheap to do (i.e. one push of a button). 
<br>
<p>The problem with logic like this is that it easily falls apart. For
<br>
example, I could kill someone with a plastic knife at a fast food
<br>
restaurant. Doesn't cost me anything to do, so shouldn't it be legal?
<br>
<p>Those who follow such logic though seem to have a video game view of
<br>
reality. They seem to have this idea that laws should only restrict
<br>
behavior which is physically difficult or impossible to do, like
<br>
restrictions on a video game character, and that it is only
<br>
inappropriate (i.e. should be illegal) to go into 'God Mode' in
<br>
reality.
<br>
<p>Such is an extremely solipsistic view of reality which goes beyond mere libertarianism.
