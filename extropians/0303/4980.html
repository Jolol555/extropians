From <a href="http://washingtontimes.com/world/20030324-91340900.htm">http://washingtontimes.com/world/20030324-91340900.htm</a>

<p><p><p><p>Does the biological structure of our brains program us to believe in God? 
<br>
Advances in &quot;neurotheology&quot; have prompted some researchers to claim they can 
<br>
induce the kind of holy visions prophets may have experienced — even in those 
<br>
who are not religious believers. Top Stories 
<br>
• 12 U.S. soldiers killed or captured
<br>
• U.S. calls footage of POWs 'disgusting'
<br>
• Female captive first since Pentagon altered rule
<br>
• 7,000 rally to show support for troops
<br>
• British jet downed by 'friendly fire'
<br>
• Saddam likely still alive
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neuroscience professor Michael Persinger of Laurentian University in 
<br>
Sudbury, Ontario, has devised a helmet that uses electromagnetic fields to 
<br>
induce electrical changes in the brain's temporal lobes, which are linked 
<br>
with religious belief.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So confident is he that God is all in the mind — or the brain at least — 
<br>
that Mr. Persinger says he can induce mystical feelings in a majority of 
<br>
those willing to don his Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the British Broadcasting Corp.'s science series &quot;Horizon&quot; put his hat 
<br>
to the ultimate test: Could it get arch-skeptic and militant atheist Richard 
<br>
Dawkins to start believing in God by electrically massaging his temporal 
<br>
lobes? Mr. Dawkins, author of &quot;A Devil's Chaplain&quot; and &quot;The Blind 
<br>
Watchmaker,&quot; was the ideal candidate for a test of whether science can 
<br>
explain away religion, given his views of religion as a &quot;virus of the mind&quot; 
<br>
and an &quot;infantile regression.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment is based on the finding that some sufferers from temporal 
<br>
lobe epilepsy — a neurological disorder caused by chaotic electrical 
<br>
discharges in the temporal lobes of the brain — seem to experience devout 
<br>
hallucinations that bear striking resemblances to the mystical experiences of 
<br>
holy figures such as St. Paul and Moses.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This theory received a boost from professor Gregory Holmes, a pediatric 
<br>
neurologist at Dartmouth Medical School, who says one of the principal 
<br>
founders of the Seventh-day Adventist movement, Ellen White, in fact suffered 
<br>
from temporal lobe epilepsy. She was seen as divinely inspired as a result of 
<br>
her religious visions. The new claim that her visions were, in fact, a result 
<br>
of a brain disorder is likely to meet strong resistance from the more than 12 
<br>
million Seventh-day Adventists worldwide.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If strong religious feelings are no less a part of brain function than 
<br>
those linked with hunger and sex, the ultimate test would be to summon up 
<br>
mystical and religious beliefs experimentally.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, it would be in Mr. Dawkins' interests to experience religion for 
<br>
the first time under Mr. Persinger's helmet. After all, this would prove that 
<br>
mystical visions at last could be controlled by science and no longer were 
<br>
just at the mercy of a supernatural entity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Mr. Dawkins had some strange experiences and tinglings during the 
<br>
experiment, none of them prompted him to take up any new faith. &quot;It was a 
<br>
great disappointment,&quot; he said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Though I joked about the possibility, I of course never expected to end 
<br>
up believing in anything supernatural. But I did hope to share some of the 
<br>
feelings experienced by religious mystics when contemplating the mysteries of 
<br>
life and the cosmos,&quot; Mr. Dawkins said.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr. Persinger explained away the failure of this Transcranial Magnetic 
<br>
Stimulator: Before donning the helmet, Mr. Dawkins had scored low on a 
<br>
psychological scale measuring proneness to temporal lobe sensitivity.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Studies on identical and fraternal twin pairs raised apart suggest that 
<br>
50 percent of our religious interests are influenced by genes. It seems that 
<br>
Mr. Dawkins is genetically predisposed not to believe.

<br>
London.
