Yes, of course, what else? Remove him from power, bring him to Den Haag  and

sentence him to prison for the rest of his life. The WHOLE administration of
<br>
course that is responsible for the Iraq war. You all probably forgot that 40
<br>
% of the Iraq population are children. For every single dead child Bush
<br>
should be sentenced to livelong prison. I will gladly fly down and help
<br>
counting the bodies. Troubleyou Bush could be glad that the court in Den
<br>
Haag finds capital punishment as disgusting as I do.
<br>

<br>
<p>Errrr...., does a certain fellow by the name of Saddam have any responsibility for the sanctions taken against his nation which resulted in so many deaths?  I sense intense liberal political thinking here!  Perhaps you should be sentenced to life imprisonment for not doing more?? ; )  And to think we already have under our belts an earlier altercation between us... 
<br>
<p>While the use of sanctions was well meant, I do agree we should have dropped them when it was realized the common people were the ones being hurt and not so much Saddam and his cronies (except they had to really cut back military spending).  But still I put the bulk of the blame on Hussein for putting his people into such a position.      
<br>
<p>I am saddened to think about the several thousand U.S. soldiers who will probably die in pitched urban combat and the many more Iraqi civilians who will die as fighter/bombers &amp; choppers and artillery try to give fire support to our struggling troops on the ground.  But still I believe it is a price worth paying to free Iraq from an evil tyrant (yes, he really is evil) who has created his own middle eastern stalinist state with all the attending horrors.  
<br>
<p>This will POTENTIALLY be a great opportunity for the U.S. and the west to finally develop a democracy in a major Arab middle eastern nation.  I just hope we don't blow it!!  The good we could do potentially would almost be incalculable.  And I think a big reason other Arab leaders don't want us invading is because they fear the democracy we would create just might spread into their borders in the form of people agitating much more for their personal freedoms when they see what is right next door.  
<br>
<p>The U.S. liberation of Iraq just may be the beginning (if we play our cards right) of an era of peace and democratization for the Arab nations there.  I would suspect though being the middle east, the road will be a long and bloody one.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps the UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could present a resolution declaring that he must lose his capability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack other nations by some certain deadline,
</em><br>
<p>I know what you are trying to say. No nation or organisation is powerful
<br>
enough to remove an American President from power. YOU, the American people
<br>
must do it yourself. I certainly will come over as a militant pacifist and
<br>
help you. If you are a true patriot, you must stop these imbeciles from
<br>
bringing war to one country after another and depriving American citizens of
<br>
their freedom for a laughable shaky security with such planned laws as
<br>
Patriot Act
<br>
II. Anybody with a bit of life experience should know by now that there is
<br>
no such thing as security. Try to live with the rest risk. The Homeland
<br>
security laws are there to spred fear and paranoia among you and to let you
<br>
disappear with no right to make a phone call, if a neighbor - just for the
<br>
heck of it - denounces you of terrorist activities. This is truly deadly
<br>
evil and reminds me of the darkest period of my own country.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I totally agree with you regarding the &quot;Patriot Act&quot; and the organization set up to protect the American &quot;homeland.&quot;  I sometimes wonder if the originator of these terms had recently been reading books on Hitler's Nazi party to find inspiration...  I see us on a slippery slope when it comes to U.S. civil liberties and I fear it could result in horrors far worse than any terrorist attack.  I can't get over how most Americans have just rolled over when it comes to this.   
<br>
<p>you continue:
<br>
I repeat it over and over again: I am NOT anti-American. And I hate Saddam.
<br>
I am just furiously against the small US political elite who thinks they are
<br>
God sent and are entitled to invade one unpopular country after the other.
<br>
This must be stopped before it really starts.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>I certainly do not view you as anti-American.  But I do see you as someone who does not recognize that properly applied military power from a superpower democracy CAN actually make the world a better place.  The U.S. used force of arms to turn Germany and Japan away from dark paths, and now perhaps we can now do that for Iraq and maybe the whole region.  We will see.
<br>
<p>I'm going to be really nervous should President Bush feel God wants us to attack North Korea! lol  Iraq is a papertiger compared to that vicious hornet's nest.  We may think air attacks over there could go on with impunity (they have pathetically obsolete air defenses), but the North would soon counterattack by launching missle and heavy artillery barrages from bunkers which could level whole city blocks and kill many thousands within hours of opening fire.  I bet Bush senses the ferocity of the leaders/people there and will be very cautious.  We would defeat them in the end if a fullblown war broke out, but at a terrible price.
<br>
<p>Hubert, if you really want to know what bothers me in terms of &quot;blood being on our hands&quot; it was both the U.S. AND Europe looking the other way for the longest time while mass murder and rape happened in the former Yugoslavia, western Europe's own backyard.  Please spend a little more of your righteous indignation on that one.
<br>
<p>&quot;May you live in changing times&quot;
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
