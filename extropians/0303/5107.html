<br>
<p><em>&gt; Democracy Now! is a national, listener-sponsored public radio and TV show,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pioneering the largest community media collaboration in the country. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; program was launched six years ago as the only daily election show in public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broadcasting. Because of its success, Democracy Now! broadened its focus and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became a national news show committed to bringing the voices of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marginalized to the airwaves on issues ranging from the global to the local.
</em><br>
<p>May I inquire as to what their ideological bias is?  Or
<br>
do they in fact have hosts from all parts of the political
<br>
spectrum, or show many reports which cannot be determined
<br>
by the most discerning viewer to be leftward or rightward
<br>
tilting?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can listen to their unembedded reporters online:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.democracynow.org/about.htm">http://www.democracynow.org/about.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Meanwhile, Lee Corbin seems to be offended because Damien Broderick posted a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; link to a news story that contained reports of Iraqi casualties.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, not offended so much as disappointed.  There
<br>
are a very few of us on this list that wouldn't
<br>
have re-directed the partisan component of a post
<br>
to a link.  I had thought that Damien was the other
<br>
one.
<br>
<p>Still, he's far from the class of people who retort to a
<br>
posting (like Amara's today from Richard Dawkins) by
<br>
saying, &quot;Oh yeah!?  Well here's the contrary view, pal!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would not presume to tell Lee or anyone else what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their political opinions should be;
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  I'm not sure how ambiguous is.  My whole history on
<br>
this list, as I've supplemented with many personal anecdotes,
<br>
is that all points of view submitted in good taste are to be
<br>
respected.  Of course, that does not mean &quot;agreed with&quot; ;-)
<br>
<p>But I mean to say that neither side has any monopoly whatsoever
<br>
on intelligence, moral rightness, or superior knowledge.  Yet
<br>
I could tell you the names of some very nice people on this
<br>
list that do not agree with that.  (Certainly Damien is not
<br>
among them, and I certainly hope that you are also not.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but when one forms his opinions with blinders on, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it's safe to say that his opinions are probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not consistent with reality.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, if spoken carefully, then this is a very key mistake
<br>
that you are making.  We *all* have ideological blinders.
<br>
Just some of us refuse to admit it, or arent'aware of it.
<br>
Some people suppose that by a miracle of God or something,
<br>
they have fortuitously been allowed by the universe to
<br>
form their opinions free of bias and prejudice.  Hence,
<br>
as one notable correspondent put it on this list not so
<br>
long ago, their opponents simply don't know The Truth.
<br>
<p>He was perfectly serious.  In repeated encounters, he 
<br>
claimed to be in absolute possession of the truth, and
<br>
that it was objectively true that all the people from
<br>
the other side had provably bad or wrong value systems,
<br>
and had opinions that were refutably as mistaken as if
<br>
they were claiming that 2+2=5.
<br>
<p>Your statement above appears at first reading to place
<br>
you in the same category as he.  Might you go into a 
<br>
little detail about that, perhaps saying something about
<br>
your life history, and how it was through some chance of
<br>
genes and environment that your views *are* consistent
<br>
with reality, while those of your opposite numbers on
<br>
the other side of the ideological divide are not?
<br>
<p>Lee
