<br>
<p>&quot;Max,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;May I throw in a question and a comment?  First, the question: I was 
<br>
listening to an interview with a lawyer that worked for the chief counsel of 
<br>
the Congressional Committee that investigated Watergate and President Nixon.  
<br>
(I am speaking loosely as I didn't get good mental notes at the time)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawyer said that after President Nixon resigned the chief counsel 
<br>
said they did not have enough evidence to prosecute Nixon on any count.  Do 
<br>
you know anything about this and can you illuminate the subject for me.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I must admit I can't think of the specific comment you're referring 
<br>
to, Ron. I do know that the chair of the Senate Watergate committee, North 
<br>
Carolina Democrat Sam Ervin (a decorated segregationist subsequently dubbed 
<br>
an &quot;American hero&quot; in the press) was quoted in the Cleveland Plain Dealer on 
<br>
March 10, 1974 as saying:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;No evidence was produced in the Senate Watergate hearings to support 
<br>
impeachment of President Nixon. I think this is one section of the 
<br>
Constitution on which Dick Nixon and I agree.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Naturally this comment was subsequently buried in the larger press. 
<br>
One can only imagine the uproar that would have accompanied Trent Lott 
<br>
suggesting something similar during the proceedings against President 
<br>
Clinton. But apparently it is justifiable for the Congress and media to go 
<br>
after a Republican administration at the cost of &quot;millions of taxpayer 
<br>
dollars&quot; for two years without finding any evidence.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;The comment: very few recognize how liberal President Nixon was.  To 
<br>
the list of items you volunteer let me add the guaranteed annual wage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In reading his biography I gather he wanted a liberal government but 
<br>
added the adjective tough-minded or practical -- I can't remember exactly.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me say that I agree with you to an extent on this point, Ron. The term 
<br>
you're referring to is &quot;Practical liberalism&quot;, something the President in 
<br>
effect borrowed from former British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. But let 
<br>
me also temper that by saying much of President Nixon's &quot;liberalism&quot; was 
<br>
forced upon him by what was arguably the most &quot;liberal&quot; Congress in our 
<br>
nation's history during that era. However, Nixon himself said he was &quot;liberal 
<br>
on health issues&quot;, but I would offer that had we had two brothers die of 
<br>
horrifying illness in our youths we might have reached similar positions.
<br>
<p>But most importantly, I think we can agree that President Nixon was certainly 
<br>
not &quot;a liberal&quot; in regard to foreign affairs. And by that, I mean the foolish 
<br>
arguments of that era which included unilateral disarmament, appeasement of 
<br>
the Soviets, and total abandonment of Indochina as authored by George 
<br>
McGovern, Ted Kennedy, Chris Dodd, and other members of Congress. Nixon's 
<br>
decision to draw the Chinese into tacit alliance, his airlift to Israel, and 
<br>
his attempt to save the people's of Indochina from Communism were the correct 
<br>
ones, despite the lack of public support for these initiatives. In that 
<br>
regard, Nixon's legacy is far too complex, and important, to be dismissed and 
<br>
ignored as it continues to be by those who still unapologetically hate him 
<br>
and many who simply don't know any better.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
