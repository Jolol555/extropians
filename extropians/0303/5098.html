Greg had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You're right - I don't need to see the ads.  Sometimes I might need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; watch TV, say, to get crucial emergency information.  But why is this just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; about needs? Why can't I choose to drive along the familiar highways of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; neighborhood without seeing billboards, or even particular billboards? 
</em><br>
<p>So it's obvious that he's implying that he ought to
<br>
have some kind of right *not* to see billboards.
<br>
<p>So I asked
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Just to clarify things for me, why would you say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I should have to see ugly people when I drive around?
</em><br>
<p>and you write
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You're &quot;forced&quot; to... although perhaps a Libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could suggest you could ALWAYS put your eyes out...
</em><br>
<p>which really doesn't address the question in the total
<br>
context.  Do you maintain that billboards on private
<br>
property that happen to be within sight of highways
<br>
(just as distant mountains are within sight), should
<br>
be restricted in what appears on them?
<br>
<p>(I'm *not* yet taking a stance here.  I just want you
<br>
to clarify your position by considering a *perhaps*
<br>
parallel question.)
<br>
<p>Why is one forced to look at people one considers ugly
<br>
and is not forced (I guess!?) to look at unappealing
<br>
billboards?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
