<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; As I've repeatedly stated on this list, it appears that far too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; people are either ignorant of the Geneva Conventions, or just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; give a damn about them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lots of people. Like CNN, the Pentagon, ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or have I dreamt that I saw lots of Iraqi POW around a week before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US POW's were shown on TV?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arguably the Iraqi POWs weren't presented as individuals.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were shown from a bit of distance and they weren't interviewed on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TV.  The US POWs were presented in personal closeups and were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjected to taunting questions.  This is an awfully fine line,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; though.
</em><br>
<p>Every depiction of Iraqi prisoners demonstrates the fair treatment by
<br>
allied forces of Iraqis. Every depiction of allied prisoners by Iraqis
<br>
demonstrates their abuse of prisoners. I haven't seen any Iraqi corpses
<br>
with bullet holes with powder burns in the exact middle of their
<br>
foreheads... nor have I seen any US soldiers hiding in civilian
<br>
clothes, or faking a surrender as an ambush, or shooting Iraqis who
<br>
surrender (or shooting their own soldiers intentionally, either.)
<br>
<p>Only the hopelessly deluded could ever conclude that the US is the bad
<br>
guy here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would have been hilarious if the Iraqis had declared the captured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US troops to be &quot;unlawfull combattants&quot; rather than POWs.  After
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, we do have some precedent for this, and without Security Council
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sanction this war violates international law (according to the legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experts in this part of the world).  In fact, has there even been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a proper declaration of war?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the US Congress authorised the use of force last fall, with no War
<br>
Powers Act limitations. What the anti-war faction seems to keep
<br>
forgetting is that all of the UN weasling and sqirming since last fall
<br>
was nothing more than the US giving the UN the opportunity to be
<br>
involved and be satisfied that all attempts had been made at forcing
<br>
Saddam peacefully to comply. There is nothing the UN could have done to
<br>
prevent the US from going to war short of a complete attitudinal
<br>
capitulation by Saddam. Resolution 1441 was not in any way construable
<br>
to claim that anything but a complete capitulation on WMD by Saddam
<br>
would exclude the use of force. France's threatened veto on the last
<br>
resolution was not on whether or not to use force, but on whether or
<br>
not the UN would go along with the allied use of force.
<br>
<p>There is nothing in the UN Charter which prevents a nation from acting
<br>
in self defense. Preemptive acts of self defense are not excluded by
<br>
the UN Charter either. If you see a million troops assembled on your
<br>
border, you have every right to assume they are there for one reason
<br>
only.
<br>
<p>Given the recent SARS outbreak, it should be rather obvious that when
<br>
it comes to bioweapons, the bio-equivalent of a million troops on your
<br>
border is to allow any despotic regime to posess them anywhere in the
<br>
world, unless you intend to live in a nutshell, like North Korea prefers.
