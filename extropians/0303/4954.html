<em>&gt;Amara, while I wouldn't dream of second guessing you on astronomical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matters, I'd hope you'd defer to people who actually have military
</em><br>
<em>&gt;experience in such matters as defense.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that the landscape of (trans)human lives are much larger
<br>
than a mudball of some humans acting like monkeys (Bush being the
<br>
head baboon). I find your view extremely limiting and self-defeating,
<br>
Mike, ignoring your arrogance for the moment. I wonder if you read
<br>
any of the articles that Dan posted and my one follow-up.
<br>
<p>Amara
<br>
<p>P.S.
<br>
However there are a few monkeys of a different variety:

<br>
I wish humans had common ancestors with them
<br>
<p>P.S.S  Your words here are nonsense, you know.
<br>
<em>&gt;The Soviet experience in Afghanistan is a good example of such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conflict, yet it can be seen from the US experience there a decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt;later that a certain degree of technical superiority, in both equipment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and training, can largely eliminate any advantage the local anarchists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may have once had, even when the conqueror is under both media scrutiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and feels bound by international standards of behavior.
</em><br>
<p>There was almost no &quot;media scrutiny&quot;, and the Afghans defeated the
<br>
Soviets with guerilla tactics, intelligence, and after the moderates
<br>
died or escaped, a brutal extremism that was the end result of a decade
<br>
of fighting. Please read: Lessing's &quot;The Wind Blows Away our Words&quot; for
<br>
eye-witness accounts, and a description of how the media and the rest
<br>
of the world &quot;forgot&quot; Afghanistan for many many years.
