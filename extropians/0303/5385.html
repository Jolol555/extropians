<p>I didn't reply because I don't believe the general case or 
<br>
especially this specific case can be reduced to such simple 
<br>
equations.  If it a few less people die due to one course over 
<br>
the other immediately but set into motion a series of 
<br>
repurcussions that lead to many more deaths this clearly would 
<br>
not be a win.  But there is no way to easily quantify these 
<br>
fuller costs.  Those the equation is not of much value to me at 
<br>
this time.
<br>

<em>&gt;&gt;We do not support war because we like to see people die, or get our jollies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;off of watching bombs fall in Iraq, and until you understand the reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;*why* those of us who actually support this effort support it, and address
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;those points, your comments will not persuade anyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The argument is rather lacking when we supported Saddam for 
<br>
years when he was just as bad as now and far more powerful and 
<br>
dangerous.  We have supported far worse than Saddam.  To turn 
<br>
around now and say we are justified in invading a country that 
<br>
is no clear and present threat to us on the basis of freeing it 
<br>
from the evils of Saddam is hardly convincing argument.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; People who promote &quot;peace at all costs&quot; simply do not recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that these technologies have the capacity for eliminating civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we know it (note my recent posts on SARS -- and that is probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a natural situation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Straw man.  Peace instead of unilateral and preemptive war of 
<br>
indefinite duration, very shaky justification, and unknown 
<br>
multilvel costs IS NOT &quot;peace at all costs&quot;.  Please desist from 
<br>
bringing out this tired and grossly inaccruate phrasing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll make an assertion to people who object to my position (or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities of the U.S./U.K./Au) -- *you* are *clueless* with respect
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; no respect for &quot;human dignity&quot; are to bridging the gap to the point
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;unextropic&quot; concept that they want you (&quot;us&quot;) dead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I am not in the least &quot;clueless&quot; about this.  Unfortunately for 
<br>
your argument it has nothing to with our current actions in 
<br>
Iraq. Do you believe with Mr. Bush that they &quot;want us dead&quot; just 
<br>
because they are E-V-I-L and we are so filled with Light and all 
<br>
that is Good?
