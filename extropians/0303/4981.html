<em>&gt; &gt; The Private Production of Defense

<em>&gt; Doesn't seem very plausible to me. Here are some quotes from it:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet what about defense against a state? How would insurers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; protect us from state aggression?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the case of a successful attack and invasion, these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; insurers would be faced with massive indemnification payments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Other things being equal, the risk of an attack-and hence the price of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defense insurance-would be higher in locations adjacent or in close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proximity to state territories than in places far away from any state.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The obvious strategy for a belligerent state interested in taking over an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area protected by insurance companies is to pre-announce an attack a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead of time (or whatever period long enough for most insurance policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to expire). Insurance rates for the targeted area would go way up, causing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most people in that area to be unable to afford insurance. This would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause the insurance companies to raise their rates even further, or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decline to renew policies in the targeted areas at any price. The state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can then move in largely unopposed.
</em><br>
<p>That doesn't make sense to me at all--that would be an incredibly
<br>
stupid thing for insurance companies to do. If the agressive state
<br>
announced its intent, then /demand/ for insurance would go up and
<br>
people would be willing to pay more, and insurance companies would
<br>
be stupid not to take the business.  They now have a built-in
<br>
excuse to charge higher than normal, and they have greater incentive
<br>
now to compete against each other by showing off how they're
<br>
spending the extra income on fancier new equipment and more people
<br>
and more training.  They'd probably offer discounts to people who
<br>
had trouble affording protection but who could donate labor to a
<br>
volunteer reserve corps.
