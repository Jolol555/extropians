Mr. Weisgerber stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;It would have been hilarious if the Iraqis had declared the captured
<br>
US troops to be &quot;unlawfull combattants&quot; rather than POWs.  After
<br>
all, we do have some precedent for this, and without Security Council
<br>
sanction this war violates international law (according to the legal
<br>
experts in this part of the world).  In fact, has there even been
<br>
a proper declaration of war?-- 
<br>
Christian &quot;naddy&quot; Weisgerber                          <a href="mailto:naddy@mips.inka.de?Subject=Re:%20WAR:%20Apparently%20the%20internet%20does%20NOT%20see%20censorship%20as%20damage%20and%20route">naddy@mips.inka.de</a>&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The Iraqis can do whatever they wish. This war is ultimately a war on the 
<br>
battlefield, not a war of the mind. The president, under the war powers act 
<br>
does not need a Congressional declaration of war to fight this war, he has 60 
<br>
days before seeking approval. The US doesn't require UN approval to do 
<br>
anything, why do you imply that it does? International Law is usually a means 
<br>
of ruling of business disputes between corporations. Criminal seems much more 
<br>
problematical, and as for resolving disputes between nation states, 
<br>
international law is nonexisitant.
