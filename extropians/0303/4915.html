<br>
<p>Olga,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I assume you are speaking of President Bush as you are responding to a 
<br>
question regarding him.  Do you have pictures of the President standing on a 
<br>
street &quot;shouting praises to an unseen supernatural savior?&quot;  How about a tape 
<br>
recording or even the signed testimony of witnesses?  Or is you simply taking 
<br>
a flight of fancy?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You continue by saying, &quot;The man truly sees/believes that he is 
<br>
receiving messages and is in communication with said savior.&quot;  Can you 
<br>
document this?  And this time please don't prove anything by quoting someone 
<br>
else that is off on a flight of fancy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually if you will look up the word prayer you will find people 
<br>
applying that word to a wide range of conduct -- one famous Christian used to 
<br>
regard sitting and searching his soul on a subject before writing down his 
<br>
thoughts as his particular form.  Many people say they are praying and then 
<br>
describe something I would label as contemplation or meditation.  Are you 
<br>
against the President contemplating his actions or should he simply fly off 
<br>
the handle?
<br>
