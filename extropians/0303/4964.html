<br>
<p><em>  &gt;When I see &quot;international law&quot; I see it something like this
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;&quot;inter&quot;  - &quot;national&quot;  &quot;law&quot;
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;Which part of this strikes you as the silly bit?
</em><br>
<p>The &quot;law&quot; bit.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;You may recall that the first Gulf War, to expell an illegal and
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;aggressive invasion of Kuwait was in fact carried out under
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;a UN resolution.
</em><br>
<p>And you may recall that between April and July of 1994 more than 800,000
<br>
people were murdered in the genocide in Rwanda, the UN refused to do
<br>
anything about it, the USA did nothing either and if they had put a stop to
<br>
it they would have been labeled a criminal, at least according to some. A
<br>
few years later ethnic cleansing started in Kosovo and again the UN refused
<br>
to do a thing about it but this time the USA decided to become a &quot;criminal&quot;
<br>
and stop it on their own. More recent mass murders with deaths in the 5 and
<br>
6 figure range can be found in East Timor, Sierra Leone, Sudan, Angola and
<br>
more; the UN and International Suggestions did absolutely nothing to stop
<br>
any of them. Many are found of saying might doesn't make right but they
<br>
forget the UN doesn't make right either.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;There is enforcement. It arises out of the consequences of
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;having a bad reputation.
</em><br>
<p>I will not bet my life that fear of a bad reputation will protect me from a
<br>
murder like Ted Bundy; I want policemen armed with guns. I have even less
<br>
confidence that it will protect me from Osama Bin laden or Saddam Hussein
<br>
because in certain circles their reputation would improve not decline by
<br>
killing a person like me.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;the world war 11 leaders Roosevelt and Churchill saw some
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;merit in establishing the UN Charter.
</em><br>
<p>And they spent about a thousand times as much time effort and money making
<br>
one hell of a lot of weapons.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;It is not just the words that one puts on (paper) that makes
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;international law (or any other law). It is the strenght and courage
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;and conviction of those who think that promises should be kept
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;so that there is the possibility, the precious possibility of peace.
</em><br>
<p>Those who value strength, courage, honesty and peace are wonderful people
<br>
but they are not the ones I worry about, they are not the people who want to
<br>
kill me.
