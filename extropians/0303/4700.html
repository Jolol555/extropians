</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The whole legal uncertainty thing wreaks of bad faith and bad

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have you considered the possibility that there is no object

<em>&gt; answer to this question? Ambiguity is a normal part of law. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's why we have judges who are invested with authority to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpret law and contracts. In the case of international law there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are no judges that are universally accepted so it's up to each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country to interpret for themselves and to try to persuade other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries of their preferred interpretations.
</em><br>
<p>Yes I've considered it but I don't accept it. Ambiguity can arise in law
<br>
but so too can extraordinary clarity. Another UN Resolution would
<br>
have resolved any ambiguity over, for instance, whether the &quot;final 
<br>
opportunity&quot; which the Security Council afforded Iraq had passed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I do think that there *is* an answer to the legal question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether the U.S. (and/or the UK and Australia for that matter)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be acting illegally (i.e.. in breach of the UN Charter) when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they do take military action against Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why do you think that?
</em><br>
<p>Because I think that the purpose of the UN Charter is clear enough
<br>
to give guidance as to what should be done in the event of
<br>
uncertainties and also who should get to make the decision. And
<br>
because I think that in the end each of the permanent security 
<br>
council members (at least) retain the sovereign right (not to breach
<br>
the Charter) but to void it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that the legal ambiguity in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case was deliberate. U.S. wouldn't have accepted Resolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1441 if it definitively bound it to not use force against Iraq without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another Security Council approval, and France wouldn't have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voted for it if it clearly authorized the use of force.
</em><br>
<p>The US under the Bush administration might have made a mistake 
<br>
but they also may have expected to have made a better case 
<br>
between November and now and to have had a UN security 
<br>
council (or at least nine of the members and no vetos from 
<br>
the permanents) behind them by now. They might have expected
<br>
Saddam to have been caught in clear breach of 1441 that was
<br>
recognized by the permanent security council members. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This all makes sense if you assume that the purpose of France
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was to restrain American power as much as possible while not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearing to be too  unreasonable.
</em><br>
<p>I don't agree. President Bush is the President of the United States
<br>
and head of its armed forced. I don't think this all can be 
<br>
understood unless we recognized the power that is in the US 
<br>
Presidency and that President Bush has, because of that power,
<br>
since resolution 1441 was passed had the ability to take initiatives
<br>
and put propositions that other heads of state would have had to 
<br>
respond to. If we want to make sense of all this I think we do 
<br>
need to acknowledge that President Chirac could not dictate terms
<br>
to President Bush. But President Bush could put any proposition 
<br>
he wanted to the President Chirac. Even now, President Bush
<br>
has the power to pick up a telephone and get any of the leaders
<br>
of the permanent security council members on the phone. He has
<br>
the power to call for a new security council resolution and to 
<br>
craft it. He has the power to halt, for a time of his choosing, any
<br>
decision to send in the military. 
<br>
<p>Lives and property are not lost in military actions merely because
<br>
the commanders in chief are acting in bad faith. Poor judgements,
<br>
failures in critical thinking, are enough to add to the collateral 
<br>
damage and to the loss of lives on both sides. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Injecting as much ambiguity into the situation as possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was the best it could have done given the accepted facts of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq's continual breach of previous resolutions and the Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration's strong resolve in this matter. It seems to have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieved that goal (although it apparently overplayed its hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near the end and now probably appears more unreasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than it planned).
</em><br>
<p>President Bush is still the President of the USA.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Aside: I think it would have been logically valid, moral,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; honourable, and not illegal for President Bush to have, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very particular circumstances, discovered that the US had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no further obligations under the Charter as the Charter itself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had been voided by manifest bad faith on the part of another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; permanent security council member. The very lawfulness of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the law at the security council level arises because of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; good faith agreement of security council members and so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imo, when the good faith is gone so has the obligation to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; continue to honour obligations that were taken on in free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exchange for the obligations of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; President Bush did not in fact take this path however.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you saying that you think France did act in bad faith? 
</em><br>
<p>No. I am saying that if &quot;the world&quot; has doubts about whether 
<br>
either President Bush or President Chirac have been acting in
<br>
good faith then those doubts remain in large part because
<br>
President Bush has not used his power to further remove 
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Even if that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case, it would be very hard to prove to the world. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly Dominique de Villepin seems to be smart enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to leave any clear evidence of  such bad faith.
</em><br>
<p>Dominique de Villepin is not the head of state of the 
<br>
permanent security council member that is France. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would probably cause a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diplomatic disaster if the U.S. were to withdraw from the U.N. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charter at this point without having convinced the world.
</em><br>
<p>At this point, President Bush is still controlling the clock. He is
<br>
still both the President of the United States and the commander
<br>
in chief of the armed forces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  in a stronger position to do that, or alternatively to reform the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Security Council, after the war with Iraq is over.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The current situation can be differentiated from Kosovo in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that unlike with Kosovo, the Security Council is &quot;seized of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the matter&quot; and the US has by signing off on 1441
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acknowledged that the UN Security Council is seized of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; matter. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as I know this is not a commonly accepted interpretation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the phrase &quot;seized of the matter&quot;. See
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2079413">http://slate.msn.com/id/2079413</a> for a full explanation of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the phrase really means. Here's a quote from it:
</em><br>
<p>The Security Council was considering the matter in November.
<br>
President Bush decided not to go back to it for a further resolution. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A *small number* [emphasis mine] of international legal experts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also consider the phrase a linguistic manoeuvre to head off unilateral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action. The theory goes that the Security Council is actually hinting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to various national governments to hold off on, say, sending tanks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across the Euphrates River, since the dispute is still being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjudicated. If that is indeed the case, the phrase's power seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somewhat dubious--nations routinely ignore Security Council
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pleas to remain idle.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Pleas?&quot;. On matters of maintaining international peace and security
<br>
the Security Councils authority is supreme. There are *resolutions* 
<br>
that are binding on all Members that ratified the Charter (and I would
<br>
add and who have not voided it).
<br>
<p>Article 24 states. &quot;In order to ensure prompt and effective action by
<br>
the United Nations, its Members confer on the Security Council
<br>
primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and
<br>
security, and agree that in carrying out its duties under this
<br>
responsibility the Security Council acts on their behalf.   
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
