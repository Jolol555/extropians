</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
A patent is a state created monopoly, and therefore needs to be 
<br>
approached with extreme care.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Second, even as someone who opposes the idea, I don't deny for a moment
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You don't?  That's interesting.  I do consider that in a restricted 
<br>
subset of areas patents encourage innovation.  One can define this area 
<br>
as the area that requires a large initial up-front investment of 
<br>
resources.  In that area, because of it's restriction, the pool of 
<br>
potential inventors is small, and patents serve to increase the 
<br>
innovation by granting potentially large rewards to those who risk their 
<br>
investments.  But in most areas patents discourage innovation, but 
<br>
granting wide monopoly status to the entity to first be granted a 
<br>
patent, which that individual can use to forbid others from exploring 
<br>
the area.  So if many would be explorers, then the net effect of patents 
<br>
is to decrease innovation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;they encourage innovation /for its own sake/ over other things like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;craftsmanship, gradual refinement and evolution, collaborative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;development, competition, and other things I think are more important
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than mere innovation.  If people invent novel things, that's fine, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I also want people to make not-so-novel things, interesting combinations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;refinements, and customizations of existing things.  I want more people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competing to find cheaper ways to produce things.  I want people to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and exploit more markets for things than the inventor ever imagined.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Fine craftsmanship certainly has it's points.  And patents do discourage 
<br>
that because a monopoly doesn't have much incentive to engage in such 
<br>
&quot;frivolity&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The idea that inventors inherently deserve reward is the communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fallacy of the labor theory of value: the totally discredited idea that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No.  Inventors do deserve reward for their efforts.  But not unlimited 
<br>
reward, and in most areas of endeavor not a monopoly.  Of course, this 
<br>
is conditional upon a meaning for the word &quot;deserve&quot;.  I tend to think 
<br>
of it as meaning something like &quot;it is in society's best interest to 
<br>
reward this individual to achieve that worthy goal&quot;, in this case that 
<br>
would translate into &quot;Society benefits by encouraging inventors to 
<br>
expend their efforts in invention rather than in, say, ditch-digging.&quot;  
<br>
This can be argued in several ways, but communism doesn't figure into 
<br>
it, unless you consider all government communist.  (I can see a point of 
<br>
view from which that is reasonable, but when I look at it that way, then 
<br>
communism doesn't seem so bad.  Terms need definitions!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the value of a thing is inherent in its creation.  That's simply not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;true, and policies based on that idea are doomed to failure, as all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socialist systems have been.  Value is created by /demand/, and so what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Not necessarily.  Demand by whom?  If the people who want, or perhaps 
<br>
need, the item can't pay for it that doesn't make it worthless.  
<br>
Consider, e.g, a smallpox vaccine.   Nearly no individual wants it, but 
<br>
having one is vital to national security.  Or an AIDS vaccine.  Those 
<br>
who desperately need it can't afford to buy it.  Does that make it 
<br>
valuless?  Not in my eyes.  So I tend to consider the value of something 
<br>
it's contribution to the common wealth.  And this can be negative as 
<br>
well as positive.  But I also acknowledge that the &quot;value at a point&quot; of 
<br>
something can be quite different than it's global average value.  And if 
<br>
you get a blood transfusion from someone who is suspected of having 
<br>
AIDS, then the value of a vaccine to you would suddenly increase 
<br>
dramatically.  Value isn't the same as cost or price.  Those are merely 
<br>
attempts to measure value.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;should be rewarded is the ability to fulfill demand, whether by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;innovation or other means.  Without patents, innovation will still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rewarded /when it fulfills a demand/, but not otherwise, which is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it should be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Demand... that's the kind of argument that causes people to consider 
<br>
heroin and tobacco valuable, when by my measure they have a negative value.
