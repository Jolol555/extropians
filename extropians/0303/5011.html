<p>It isn't essential to my point about economic forces being real forces

that need to be considered in the analysis.

<p>But what leads &quot;him&quot; (part of the personality) to &quot;consent&quot; (behave as if
<br>
a choice had been made, not entirely consistently) is that forces,
<br>
&quot;internal&quot; or &quot;external&quot; have acted upon the elements of the personality
<br>
so as to bring this event about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Does he consent to being

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That would be silly.  No one has full consent over what memes

<em>&gt; suicide-bomber-meme.
</em><br>
<p>It is silly - that is the point of my asking the question, to expose this,
<br>
although I did not intend a reductio ad absurdum.
<br>
<p>Rather than say people then &quot;choose&quot; which memes to adopt, I would
<br>
break it down a bit more and say that the memes that a person happens upon
<br>
may or may not enter into symbiosis with the person, depending upon the
<br>
characteristics at the time of the person (and all their mind's parts) and
<br>
the meme and the whole rest of the environment. Some of the critical
<br>
characteristics of the person and their mind may be other memes, or memory
<br>
traces, or inherited personality traits, or the metabolic state, or any of
<br>
a host of other characteristics. These various elements/units interact and
<br>
can exert various forces. The behaviors of the person, including their
<br>
appearance of &quot;choice&quot;, are a result of at least some of these forces.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Does he consent to only two products of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sort he wants being available? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; His power of consent does not determine how many competitors are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   in a particular field directly or how many products of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind he wants are currently being offered except indirectly in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the fact of his ability to choose (consent) makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition possible.  Again, such overarching consent as to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-determine the number of things that can be chosen from is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not in the least necessary for consent to be real.
</em><br>
<p>Consent is a concept. I am breaking it down to reveal that it can be
<br>
affected by economic considerations, thus making it not entirely the
<br>
property of the isolated, detached &quot;individual&quot; of traditional
<br>
philosophy. Perhaps that is the basic point of disagreement I have - that
<br>
the old philosophy does not highlight enough how human beings are formed
<br>
and operate openly, as systems in interaction with the general
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p>The practical upshot is that a company's product line for what you want to
<br>
buy DOES affect your choice, since it constrains WHAT you can buy, and
<br>
even what you are most LIKELY to buy, based on who you are, etc. Infinite
<br>
freedom of choice is imaginary - in the real world choices are
<br>
constrained by various factors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Same answer as above and also irrelevant in first-world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communities where an abundance of product choices are generally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at hand.
</em><br>
<p>No matter how many products are sold of a certain type, if you want one of
<br>
that type, you can only buy X of Y (one of the available), not X of Y+1.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, to some degree.  There is a continuing battle to widen the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; degree of choice here.  Also, marketing does not overrule consent.
</em><br>
<p>Marketing can affect &quot;consent&quot;. No matter how much choice of products is
<br>
widened, it cannot be widened to infinity, in theory (unless
<br>
literally infinite variety of products are actually available, each of
<br>
them perfectly equal in appeal, accessibility, cost, etc.).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Marketing can only influence choices to some degree.  It is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technique of persuasion and not coercion.   The targets of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marketing still choose.
</em><br>
<p>All choices can be understood as results of combined forces acting within
<br>
or upon the personality - again, &quot;coercion&quot; and &quot;persuasion&quot; are just
<br>
conceptual categories for certain types of forces. One could say that a
<br>
person who has a gun to their head still &quot;chooses&quot; - they just choose,
<br>
perhaps, to do what they have to not to die.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The deeper argument that consent is meaningless unless one can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chose (consent to) one's own nature is empty and devoid of value.
</em><br>
<p>This is certainly not my argument. But if you regard a person's
<br>
&quot;nature&quot; as part of their personality, then it is related to what
<br>
&quot;chooses&quot;, and since it is not &quot;chosen&quot;, then there is no choice that is
<br>
not already chosen by something/someone else, another unit of force.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see.  I was not aware I was speaking with an automaton.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will choose to stop doing so now. :-)
</em><br>
<p>Sentient and intelligent automatons - that ought to be familiar to people
<br>
on this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seriously, questions of freedom vs. coercion can only be asked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and answered in terms of what *is* including the nature of human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings.  It cannot be meaningfully discussed in terms of some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imaginary possibility of real &quot;consent&quot; to choose everything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the nature of and contents of reality down to any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desired level.
</em><br>
<p>I am asking the questions only to make my point. &quot;Choice&quot; or &quot;consent&quot; as
<br>
framed by the old philosophy would cause an endless regression. The
<br>
ancient took the regression back to the First Cause, aka the old Israeli
<br>
war god Yahweh, creator of humans and first Programmer of Human Nature.
<br>
<p>In reality, human beings' minds are partly open systems, open to the
<br>
environment. When we notice what has formed us, what is continuing to form
<br>
us and our decisions, then we - that is, our conscious attentive
<br>
etc. self - can be in a position to exert a deeper bit of control if we so
<br>
choose. But if we foolishly imagine we are immune to economic forces, and
<br>
actually have a transcendently free nature, then we are all the more
<br>
puppets of other puppeteers since we don't notice the strings attached to
<br>
our arms. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What would you substitute for economic consent/choice which you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard as coercion?  The State choosing for us?
</em><br>
<p>The state is just another product of the forces, forming and being
<br>
formed. I suggest the relationship we all have to economic and political
<br>
forces can be tidied up, improved to increase our happiness, if we perform
<br>
a more detailed analysis of how things are working - how the complex
<br>
interactive system is working on us, by us, through us, in us. We and the
<br>
state are one. We and the economy are one. We are a complex,
<br>
partly open subsystem of units within the whole dynamic system. There is
<br>
no detached &quot;us&quot; facing off against a detached &quot;it&quot;, able to make a
<br>
transcendently free &quot;choice&quot; that is uniquely &quot;ours&quot; to affect &quot;it&quot;. We
<br>
are not a thought in the mind of God, but a thought in the mind of the
<br>
world.
