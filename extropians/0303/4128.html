<em>&gt; (Hal Finney &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Do%20patents%20really%20foster%20innovation?">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I foresee a day when every patent will have a link you can click on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; license it.  As the internet works to drive down transaction costs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all other areas, it will facilitate patent licensing as well.  This might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even be a huge economic opportunity for the first company to facilitate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this process.  Maybe they can even get a business patent on the idea...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Once patents are no longer a brick wall, but rather a limited tax,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they will be much less of a problem and opposition to them will decrease.
</em><br>
<p>That's similar to a scheme already in use that eases some of the
<br>
burden of copyright: mandatory licensing.  If a radio station wants
<br>
to play a tune, they don't need to negotiate with the owner, they
<br>
just a pay a fixed fee set by law, and the owner collects it, but
<br>
doesn't have the option to say no.  These mandatory licensing
<br>
schemes are very limited though, and fees are generally still
<br>
higher than what would be economically efficient.
<br>
<p>If we must have patents to encourage long-term investment in R&amp;D,
<br>
then one way to ease the burden and reduce the licensing costs is
<br>
to include a statutory licensing scheme.  If you sell a widget based
<br>
on patented ideas, you can apportion a percentage of your profits
<br>
among the patentholders according to a formula fixed in law, and
<br>
not have to negotiate anything or risk that a patentholder will
<br>
refuse entirely.  That at least takes away the one most serious
<br>
flaw of the system--the owner who can just say no, using the patent
<br>
for the exact opposite of its intended purpose to &quot;promote progress&quot;.
