<p>I don't think that's how karma works.  Rather, if you look at the BBS
<br>
interface, for example this thread at
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=55166">http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=55166</a>
<br>
and you look under the Karma display for each post, you see two links:
<br>
[applaud] [smite].  At least, you see this if you're logged in, maybe
<br>
you don't see them if you're browsing anonymously.
<br>
<p>My assumption is that the first karma number is the number of people who
<br>
have hit [applaud], and the second is the number who have hit [smite].
<br>
The positioning of these hyperlinked words approximately under the
<br>
corresponding karma values suggests this interpretation, as does the
<br>
terminology being used.  Also I think the times I have applauded or
<br>
smote someone I think their score has changed in the expected way.
<br>
<p>It might be nice to hear from the maintainers of the BBS how exactly
<br>
the karma score works.  Can you applaud someone more than once, or
<br>
smite them?

<p>Was that talking about the BBS interface like the one I gave the
<br>
URL to above?  Or is their another archive that is cool?
