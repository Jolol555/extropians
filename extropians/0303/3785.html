Hi folks,
<br>
<p>Over the course of the past five days, and nights, I have been working
<br>
(hard) to developing the skills necessary to successfully achieve Lucid
<br>
Dreaming. For anyone unfamiliar with the term, it means consciously
<br>
realizing that one is asleep and dreaming, when one is, in fact, asleep and
<br>
dreaming.
<br>
<p>After researching the topic from a transhumanist angle (the only angle I now
<br>
possess), I've become convinced that LD may offer an extraordinarily high
<br>
resolution &quot;sneak peek&quot; into what complete immersion in a seamless virtual
<br>
reality, or life as an upload may be like (minus the mind-mind networking
<br>
capability of course).
<br>
<p>I am very excited about this! Although I have yet to achieve true
<br>
intentional REM lucidity (the literature does explain that such early
<br>
successes are fairly uncommon) I do believe I'm making excellent progress.
<br>
<p>Consider:
<br>
<p>1. Five days ago I could not have described a single dream that I've had in
<br>
2003, or even in the present century for that matter. Not a single one.
<br>
Prior to this experiment, the only thing I could have said for certain is
<br>
that I'm reasonably sure I was indeed having dreams, but the details have
<br>
all but vanished.
<br>
<p>Quite astonishing really when you think about it - all those adventures,
<br>
dramas, traumas, pleasures - gone without a trace, or maybe hiding in the
<br>
shadows of my subconscious to nudge me with a future feelings of deja vous.
<br>
<p>2. Today I can describe in vivid detail up to seven dreams that I've had
<br>
recently - four of them last night as a matter of fact! I guess I won't
<br>
bother writing them out here, but the point is, I could. One thing - my
<br>
dreams seem to be getting more vivid and in some ways more disturbing. This
<br>
combined with some other recurring themes lead me to believe that my
<br>
subconscious may actually be putting up some kind of concerted defense
<br>
against my conscious mind breaking through. Incredible!
<br>
<p>3. I have also had one poignant success at maintaining conscious awareness
<br>
well into the first stages of sleep. I knew I was falling asleep, yet I
<br>
remained completely aware that my thoughts were becoming oddly random,
<br>
colors were shifting and textures were changing. Ambient sounds were became
<br>
hollowed out and were replaced with different sounds. The last thing I
<br>
remember is a sense of complete wonder that I had never noticed these
<br>
presumably daily events from this detached calm frame of reference before.
<br>
<p>The training regimen I've created for myself is fairly straight forward. My
<br>
watch beeps every hour on the hour during the day, and that reminds me to
<br>
perform a &quot;Reality Check&quot;
<br>
<p>i.e. I simply ask myself: &quot;Is this a dream?&quot; and then I glance at my hands
<br>
for a few seconds for any signs of &quot;weirdness&quot;. Then I look at my watch,
<br>
look away, and look back again to see if the numerals remain consistent and
<br>
logical. Another quick glance around at my surroundings, and then it's back
<br>
to whatever I was doing before. Apparently when this has become completely
<br>
second nature, I can expect that I'll do it while engaged in an actual
<br>
dream. At that point, it will supposedly be able to realize that I'm
<br>
dreaming. Then I can either begin to exert control over the path of the
<br>
dream, or simply go with the flow.
<br>
<p>Before I fall asleep each night, I also try to visualize myself being
<br>
consciously awake in my dreams, and if I wake up immediately after a dream,
<br>
(a regular occurrence now) I lie very still and repeatedly go over as many
<br>
details as possible to try to commit them to conscious memory.
<br>
<p>A couple of other things that I keep in mind:
<br>
<p>-  &quot;the poker hand&quot; (remembering to remain emotionally cool and detached the
<br>
moment I first realize I have achieved success - lest the excitement wake me
<br>
up - a commonly reported occurrence)
<br>
<p>- and &quot;dream spinning&quot; (physically spinning my dream body around in a circle
<br>
in an effort to restore a lucid dream that appears to be fading)
<br>
<p>Anyhow, I'll let you all know when I'm successful at this, here's a few
<br>
links if you're interested. BTW, I'd love to purchase the fancy eyewear and
<br>
computer interface gadget, but supposedly they aren't really necessary and,
<br>
yikes, three hundred bucks!
