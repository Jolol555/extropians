<p>
I need to read all the posts in a thread before replying,
<br>
and wasting people's time.
<br>
<p>John Clark wisely notes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;International Law&quot; is a silly term anyway, a &quot;law&quot; means things must happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this was as in the laws of motion or it means punishment will result from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law enforcers. &quot;International Law&quot; is neither of these as was recently shown
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when Iraq thumbed its nose at UN resolution 1441 and the UN did nothing;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore I think the term &quot;International Law&quot; should be retired on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list and replaced with what it actually is &quot;International Suggestions&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If the US can invade Iraq any time it wants, with or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without UN permission why shouldn't Turkey do the same?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; For the exact same reason it has been throughout all of history,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'd get the shit kicked out of them if they did.
</em><br>
<p>A student of history, I see.
<br>
<p>Ron adds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is true that the League of Nations failed and now it appears that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United Nations will fail also.  For purpose of discussion let me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that the UN is dead and is just in the process of final collapse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- it is over but the shouting.
</em><br>
<p>I wish to demur.  I also thought that all the leftists were dead
<br>
wrong when they gave for one reason not to invade Iraq:  &quot;It will
<br>
mean the death of the U.N.&quot;.
<br>
<p>The U.N. will always be around.  It will always be around just as
<br>
it is now, and will always pass resolutions condemning someone or
<br>
other.  This is hardly a useless role.  The weight of world opinion
<br>
does matter.
<br>
<p>The U.N. will stay alive and in its essentially same position
<br>
because and only because it will continue to be supported by
<br>
Earth's major nations.  India, Russia, the U.S., France, Germany,
<br>
Japan, China, and the U.K. will continue to support it for the
<br>
very same reasons that they always have.  There is even a hope
<br>
that its authority will grow.
<br>
<p>But it is a setback for the U.N. when it proved itself unable
<br>
to back up its own resolutions.  And that's no one's fault but
<br>
France, Russia, Germany, and China, the gang of four.
<br>
<p>Lee
