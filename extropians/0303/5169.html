<p>
<em>&gt;&gt; Has ANYBODY succeeded in getting either stills or video of the POW
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; broadcast aired by the enemy TV network?
</em><br>
<p>In case no one has yet answered this in the affirmative...
<br>
<p>I have on my hard-drive the censored Al-Jazeera video footage of both
<br>
the POW interviews and the gruesome footage of dead US military personnel,
<br>
in .asf format, viewable in Windows Media Player. I'd rather not mention
<br>
the source URL... I don't want my name associated in any way with the sick
<br>
freaks who run the site in question. Recently the FBI tried to shut
<br>
the site down for broadcasting the video footage of Daniel Pearl's
<br>
decapitation,
<br>
which they purportedly still have in their archives for downloading. No
<br>
doubt
<br>
the site is again under pressure from the FBI for publishing this war
<br>
footage.
<br>
I was tipped off to the website by a recent Reuter's news article, so others
<br>
here could probably find it if they want to find it.
<br>
<p>Otherwise, if anyone here really wants to see these disturbing broadcasts
<br>
then
<br>
I would be okay with sending them upon request by private email attachment.
<br>
Just drop me a note at my email address above. I believe every US citizen
<br>
has a constitutional right to view the footage, but I believe also that the
<br>
government and the mainstream media are correct that such things
<br>
ought not be broadcast unsolicited into every American home.
<br>
<p>The POW interviews video is about 5 megs. The executed soldiers footage is
<br>
about 7 megs.
<br>
<p>My main personal reason for downloading these video clips is that I wanted
<br>
to
<br>
see with my own eyes whether coalition soldiers were actually shot in the
<br>
head
<br>
as has been alleged. The answer is yes. The footage makes it abundantly
<br>
clear,
<br>
with close-ups, that at least one of our own was shot point-blank in the
<br>
center
<br>
of the forehead. It is disturbing footage and not for the faint of heart. It
<br>
serves as a sobering reminder that this war is not some kind of video game
<br>
played on cable news networks by retired generals. Any footage that may
<br>
emerge
<br>
of the deaths of innocent Iraqi citizens will be equally as sobering.
<br>
<p>May God bless America if she's in the right, and forgive her if she's not.
<br>
<p>-gts
