<p>Who owns the major media?  You may consider them leftist, but I consider 
<br>
them more opportunist.  Certainly the policies of the owners of the 
<br>
media are not liberal.  If they condone a liberal voice in the 
<br>
publication, it is not out of affection for the message, but in order to 
<br>
1) keep control of what can be said, and 2) earn money selling papers.  
<br>
Most ostensibly liberal publications will suddenly turn very 
<br>
conservative when recommending who or what to vote for.  (I didn't say 
<br>
centrist, because that wasn't what I meant.)
<br>
<p>This assertion is based, I admit, on much to small a sample to place 
<br>
much reliance on it, but it fits everywhere I've examined things (except 
<br>
the small presses... and the chains of small papers are being purchased 
<br>
and also having their policies dictated from a more central location).
<br>
<p>I haven't looked for better evidence, because it's what my model of how 
<br>
society operates would predict, so I only check sporadically.  But one 
<br>
expects capital intensive operations to be owned by someone with a bunch 
<br>
of capital.  And one expects such a person to be rather conservative.  
<br>
And, given the low rate of return of most newspapers, one expects most 
<br>
of the owner's attention to be given to more remunerative enterprises.  
<br>
So I feel that any assertion that things work in a different way 
<br>
requires extra proof.  (What encouragement do you require to annoy the 
<br>
person who signs your pay check, and evaluates you job performance?  One 
<br>
would normally assume that it would require significan cause.)
