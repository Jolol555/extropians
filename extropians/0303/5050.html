<p><em>&gt; Could it be that we were all wrong about the degree to which

</em><br>
<p>Much of the Internet is not robust at all.  The core may feature
<br>
multiple redundancy but most of the fringe passes through (multiple)
<br>
single points of failure.  Redundancy is expensive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Has ANYBODY succeeded in getting either stills or video of the POW broadcast

</em><br>
<p>I'm under the impression that these were actually aired all over
<br>
the world, with the exception of the USA.  German TV reported the
<br>
footage wasn't shown on US TV to spare the relatives of US servicemen
<br>
the humiliation to learn about their fate in the news but that one
<br>
&quot;conservative&quot; newspaper (the Washington Post, IIRC) had printed
<br>
stills on their front page.
<br>
<p>I haven't even looked for online pictures, but I notice that the
<br>
Russian site I pointed to last night happens to have some stills:
<br>
<a href="http://www.aeronautics.ru/news/news002/news076.htm">http://www.aeronautics.ru/news/news002/news076.htm</a>
<br>
<p>(This site does have intermittent connectivity problems from my part
<br>
of the world, but that is not unusual for hosts in Russia.)
