<p>
I must say that I am frightened about this war. I'm not a religious person
<br>
but I find myself actually praying that Saddam does not have weapons of mass
<br>
destruction ready and available to use against our troops, against Israel
<br>
and/or Kuwait, and against his own people. If he really has WMD then it's
<br>
going to be bloody hell.
<br>
<p>Like Russia, China, Germany, France, and many other important countries, I
<br>
just cannot find good reason to support this attack on Iraq. I realize
<br>
Saddam is a thug and murderer and a ruthless dictator, but I have not seen a
<br>
convincing case that he presents an imminent threat to the USA. In my mind I
<br>
cannot justify a pre-emptive strike when there is not a clear and imminent
<br>
threat! 
<br>
<p>Also, the world community looks to us to set an example in international
<br>
relations. If we Americans assert that we have the legal and moral right to
<br>
launch a pre-emptive strike against vague theoretical threats like Iraq,
<br>
then what argument do we have to stop other countries from doing the same?
<br>
Why, for example, should China not launch a pre-emptive strike against
<br>
Taiwan? And why not India against Pakistan or vice versa? And what about
<br>
North Korea against its neighbors? If other countries follow our example
<br>
then the world is going to be in deep shit over the next several decades.
<br>
<p>Bush's case that Saddam is a sponsor of international terrorism is weak at
<br>
best. Saddam is more like a Mafia boss who rules his tiny corner of the
<br>
earth with an iron fist. He's an asshole and a bad-guy, for sure, but
<br>
there's no clear evidence that he supports international terrorists like the
<br>
Al-Qaeda. In fact Osama bin Laden calls Saddam a &quot;socialist infidel&quot;! Saddam
<br>
is basically a secularist dictator, with little sympathy for the Holy Jihad
<br>
that motivates the real international terrorists. 
<br>
<p>It looks to me, and to much of the world community it seems, that Bush is
<br>
waging this war in an emotional reaction to 9/11, and because he doesn't
<br>
want his dad to go down in history as the president who didn't finish the
<br>
Gulf War. 
<br>
<p>Our only important friend here is Tony Blair, but several of Tony Blair's
<br>
cabinet members have already resigned because of Blair's support of this
<br>
war. 
<br>
<p>Last I heard even our good friend and neighbor Canada was refusing to send
<br>
troops. 
<br>
<p>And what about the UN? According to the UN, we're going to war illegally in
<br>
violation of the UN, supposedly because Iraq is illegally in violation of
<br>
the UN. But wait... is the UN a world legal authority, or not? We can't have
<br>
it both ways! 
<br>
<p>Bush's response to the UN argument is that he believes Iraq is an imminent
<br>
threat to the USA, and that we are a sovereign country, and that it's his
<br>
responsibility to protect the American people. I agree wholeheartedly that
<br>
we are a sovereign country and that we don't need permission from the UN to
<br>
wage war, but the argument that Iraq is a serious threat to the USA is total
<br>
bullshit. We bombed the hell out of Iraq 12 years ago, and for most of the
<br>
time since then we've restrained Saddam with weapons inspections and
<br>
economic sanctions. As far as his conventional forces and weapons go, Saddam
<br>
can barely fight his way out of a paper bag. 
<br>
<p>And that leaves Saddam *desperate*. He's backed into a corner, possibly with
<br>
his finger on the trigger of chemical or biological weapons, or worse. If I
<br>
were him then I would be thinking about how best to go out in a blaze of
<br>
glory. Let's hope he doesn't really have the weapons that we accuse him of
<br>
having.
