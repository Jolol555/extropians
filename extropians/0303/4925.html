<br>
I thought it was our goal to create a world or pockets therein of maximum     
<br>
extropy.  I don't see how those pockets can be created without maximizing     
<br>
freedom and individual rights.                                                
<br>
<p><p>Neither can I, but I didn't expect Samantha to say this. The primary problem I
<br>
see is that so many make such an assumption but then abdicate by claiming that
<br>
such can only be created by peaceful means. Freedom has just about never been
<br>
achieved by peaceful means, the only two instances I can think of for such
<br>
occured exclusively within the anglosphere (South Africa and India).
<br>
<p>Extropy may be for spontaneous order, but order in and of itself is
<br>
not necessarily extropic, it is frequently stasist in nature, and the
<br>
calcification endemic to extended order frequently requires a little creative
<br>
destruction to enable a renewal of extropic forces.
<br>
<p>Given that there really is no place in the world of 'savage wilderness' in the
<br>
Lockean sense to create a new extropic/libertarian utopia, such a society can
<br>
only be created by supplanting/destroying/transforming an existing order in
<br>
an existing society. A large degree of this has already occured in the last
<br>
decade with the transformative influence of the internet.
<br>
<p>In this respect, extropy has largely succeeded in its most easily obtainable
<br>
objectives. At the present time, however, we are restrained from building
<br>
an even freer society by the security threats posed by terrorist groups and
<br>
states that retain power, wealth, and influence and have declared themselves
<br>
to be enemies of the sort of world that extropians have stated they want to
<br>
build.
<br>
<p>We are for civilian cryptography, but it is used to hide terrorist
<br>
communications. We are for data havens, nanotech, and freely available
<br>
biotech research. We are for civilian space exploration, as well as many
<br>
other things. All of these are under threat of restriction because of
<br>
the threat of terrorism and insurgencies by rogue states holding the
<br>
world hostage. Libertarian societies do not deal well with terrorist
<br>
insurgencies. They require a commonality of belief in libertarian principles
<br>
by all members of such societies. In order to build such a society, we must
<br>
first make the world safe enough that most people can feel secure in the free
<br>
exercise of such liberties.
<br>
<p>Groups like al Qaeda and governments like Iraq and North Korea, as extreme
<br>
examples, stand foursquare against extropy and liberty. While there are many
<br>
other oppositionist groups and governments in the world that will stand in the
<br>
way of extropy and libertarian principles, these are the most eggregious.
<br>
<p>Claiming to be high minded in taking a passive stance is simply facetious
<br>
hypocrisy. Inaction in pursuit of extropy is no virtue, to paraphrase
<br>
Cato. Simply sitting idly by and waiting for such states to collapse is simply
<br>
pollyannish.
