Generally speaking I gave up on your posts a long time ago, Ron.  So 
<br>
whatever you ask me is not likely to be answered.  However, I just 
<br>
changed email software again and my blocks were temporarily down.  I 
<br>
am working in my spare time on an exhaustive list of what rights we 
<br>
now on paper have lost and how those changes have in fact been used.  
<br>
It will be in website form when I am done.

<em>&gt; Now the section &quot;Ron, your paranoid political leaders did not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn French Fries into Freedom Fries - which in itself is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kindergarten level -- but they are going to exchange your freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a shaky security in a future police state&quot; IMHO is pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partisan political writing and I will dismiss it out of hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the section, &quot;Turn to the following URL where Patriot Act II is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoroughly explained:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=11835&amp;c=206">http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=11835&amp;c=206</a>I</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears to be responsive to my question, assuming that it is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer that Samantha would have given.  Until Samantha answers we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will never know.  Lets see what it says.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The document under discussion says: &quot;Interested Persons Memo:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Section-by-Section Analysis of Justice Department draft “Domestic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Security Enhancement Act of 2003,” also known as “PATRIOT Act II”&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humania you have just given us an ACLU commentary on a piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing that the ACLU says is a legislative draft by the Justice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Department of the United States Government for something called the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PATRIOT Act II.  There isn't even a copy of the original, nor is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there any indication as to who the writer was. I don't know what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country you are from but many of our list members are from outside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US so let me expand on what we are looking at. Many pieces of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;draft legislation&quot; float around Washington, DC all the time.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are more authoritative than others.  I see no reason to question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ACLUs motives, they state them at the head of this piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing, they are drumming up new members.  Still they will not get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embarrassingly off the mark.  After all they want to win members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to be laughed at. Someday possibly some person or persons that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks the ideas contained in this &quot;draft legislation&quot; might decide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will make a good law. They may or may not rewrite it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Under the system we use in passing laws two sponsors for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed law will be found, one Republican and one Democrat.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republicans name will be listed first as the Republicans control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; congress.  The bill will be placed in the hopper and in due course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will go in front of one or more committees in both the House of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Representatives and in the U. S. Senate.  The committees will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss the bill.  Perhaps, in fact almost certainly, the bill will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get rewritten to contain some unknown changes.  When all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; committees in each house finally agree the bill probably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reported to the entire body.  Some bills die in committee so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not a guarantee.  The bill will be debated on the floor of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; House or Senate and if passed (that is no guarentee either) it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a committee made up of members from the House and the Senate. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Joint Committee will reconcile the two versions of the bill if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences exist.  That will be done in accordance political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bargaining between the House and Senate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The reconciled bill will be returned for further debate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes and voting.  Eventually the bill will be voted up or down. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the bill is passed it will go to our President for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration.  He may accept the bill and sign it or he may veto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bill.  He may call in the concerned members of Congress and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss the bill.  From here we may or may not get another round of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; writing, horse trading and voting.  But even at this point we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not sure we will ever pass this law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I do think we must be careful not to use intemperate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language on subjects such as this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, as Americans we can scare the dickens out of foreign members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that don't understand the American legislative system.  Some people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly won't know an American law from something that is less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solid than a pipe dream. Let me give two quick examples.  I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harry S Truman first tried to pass Universal Medical Care in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nineteen forties.  The thing has hung around every since, being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed, discussed and then voted down for the time being.  Dick
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nixon proposed a Guaranteed Annual Wage in the early 70s.  Both are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still around, neither is law nor likely to be very soon. Second, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropians laws similar to Patriots Act II covers material that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of deep concern to us whether we are from the left or from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right.  Using language that splits our group only weakens us and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes it easier for someone to actually pass such a monstrosity.
