<em>&gt; &gt; I don't have contempt for international law and who knows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; someday it might actually exist but it doesn't now. I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; contempt for the international suggestions that do actually exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; either, in fact some of  them are quite wise but laws they are not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't understand John. Do you doubt that the UN Charter exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and has been signed (and ratified) by the United States and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member nations? Or are you saying, as I think you are, that it does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist but that it is not international law? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the UN Charter, the USA actually holds the signed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; documents. The papers that are the ratified original documents.
</em><br>
<p>Papers aren't laws. The constitution of the USSR guaranteed
<br>
free speech on paper, but what do you think the law really was?
<br>
Speak out, go to jail. The law is /by definition/ that which is
<br>
backed with the threat of force. It's illegal for me to steal,
<br>
not because somebody happened to write down a law against it, but
<br>
because if I do, there is a realistic chance that I will be
<br>
physically seized, tried, and imprisoned. It is written on paper
<br>
that California residents can grow and use Marijuana for medical
<br>
purposes. But the /law/ is that those who do risk arrest and
<br>
prison on federal charges.
<br>
<p>It is a nice feature of civilized society that what's written on
<br>
paper and the law actually enforced should be as close as possible.
<br>
That's called the &quot;rule of law&quot;, and it is a noble goal.  But I
<br>
don't know any society that has actually achieved it.  So-called
<br>
&quot;international law&quot; doesn't even come close.
