</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee, the result was foreseen, the action was

</em><br>
<p><p>No.  Many of those who minister to those in need as well as many 
<br>
who have very different task in the world such as medicine would 
<br>
sell their souls to end the need for their services.  Such 
<br>
cynicism as the above is not very becoming.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But the pressing question is still, what *can* be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; done in cases of famine?  Are we to just turn our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; backs?  (Unless you invade, what other option is there?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The answer is harsh, but no more so than the actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have already been taken in the name of charity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The technically advanced must have the courage to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declare that all cultures are not truly equal, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some cultures really are better than others, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology really does make for longer, healthier,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happier, better lives.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well, does that mean we just let them starve or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nonviolent memetic warfare is called for.  Are we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally obligated to respect other's lives and safety?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course.  Are we morally obligated to respect other's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures, religions and customs? 
</em><br>
<p>The question was whether we feed them or not.  These other 
<br>
questions were not what was asked.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I argue that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, that ideas want to be free.  Ideas will make their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way into closed cultures, and those cultures will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be turned upside down.  We cannot stop that, we do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to stop that.  The old ways will be overturned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No one can lock up any sizable piece of real estate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this planet for any one religion or custom.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can stop a radio wave.  No one can stop capitalism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What the hell does this have to do with the question?
