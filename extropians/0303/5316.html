</em><br>
<em>&gt; they put all their cards on the table. Would you rather have a network that

</em><br>
<p>Yes, Fox want the US to win at the behest of their masters voice, heard
<br>
worldwide, but if we want to talk about moral equilavency lets look at
<br>
what he has to say about the war
<br>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;
<br>
<p>Most revealing of all was Murdoch's reference to the rationale for going
<br>
to war, blatantly using the o-word. Politicians in the United States and
<br>
Britain have strenuously denied the significance of oil, but Murdoch
<br>
wasn't so reticent. He believes that deposing the Iraqi leader would
<br>
lead to cheaper oil. &quot;The greatest thing to come out of this for the
<br>
world economy...would be $20 a barrel for oil. That's bigger than any
<br>
tax cut in any country.&quot; 
<br>
<p>He went even further down this road in an interview the week before with
<br>
America's Fortune magazine by forecasting a postwar economic boom. &quot;Once
<br>
it [Iraq] is behind us, the whole world will benefit from cheaper oil
<br>
which will be a bigger stimulus than anything else.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;
<br>
<p>exactly how many human lives is this worth to him?
