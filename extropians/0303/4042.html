<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were responding to an earlier comment, &quot;Even if you believe it is 
<br>
all wrong, we must recognize why so much of the world dislikes us.  Simply 
<br>
ascribing it to jealousy or religious fanatics is to ignore the issue.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree with you that our focus has to be on &quot;it's always a question 
<br>
of probing the deepest that we can for what's really going on.&quot;  I found the 
<br>
site for the World Economic Forum's magazine   
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.worldlink.co.uk/stories/storyReader$1159">http://www.worldlink.co.uk/stories/storyReader$1159</a>
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps you have already seen it.  I find it an interesting window 
<br>
into what others are thinking.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am getting a picture of a group of steely eyed financiers and 
<br>
businessmen that are looking out for their own interests.  In furthering 
<br>
those interests they believe the risk to America from violence to be 
<br>
acceptable (to them) and expect the US to provide them markets, be a source 
<br>
for funds, or something that improves their ability to make a profit.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Several questions occur to me:
<br>
1.  Is the risk acceptable to we in the US?
<br>
2.  What specifically is this thing or things that the international 
<br>
financiers and businessmen expect the US to provide?
<br>
3.  Do we wish to pursue a path that is to the benefit of those individuals 
<br>
and institutions?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question in my mind but that for nearly forty years, that 
<br>
I can identify, the US government whether wisely or foolishly has pursued a 
<br>
path that encourages its manufacturing firms in particular to move operations 
<br>
abroad.  As evidence I am told that today the US is on balance an importer of 
<br>
manufactured goods but an exporter of raw materials.  In other words we have 
<br>
the trade pattern of a banana republic.
