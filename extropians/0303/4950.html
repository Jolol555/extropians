</em><br>
<em>&gt; which we are so fond was initially conceived as a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; war, in which case it is kinda like an adaption of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mil-tech.  Aircraft technology has always been pushed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward by military needs, along with vertical take-off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and landing.  Eventually commercial forces became the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driver, but computers were initially developed to meet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the needs of the war fighters.  The interstate highway
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system was built to move war machines from coast to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coast.
</em><br>
<p>I have to differ from the claim that 'not much military hardware has
<br>
civilian applications'. I can think of no infantry rifle ammunition
<br>
which has not found a civilian application once it has been released to
<br>
the public, and furthermore, virtually ANYTHING that the infantryman
<br>
uses (outside of things like hand grenades) has applications in
<br>
camping, hunting, and other outdoors activities. The infantryman is
<br>
sorta the ultimate outdoorsman: parachuting, rock climbing, scuba
<br>
diving, camouflaging, tracking, orienteering, survival, etc. Todays
<br>
outdoorsman on a budget usually finds he can save lots of money and
<br>
gain some useful stuff by buying at the military surplus store instead
<br>
of EMS, REI, LL Beans, or other yuppie name brands.
<br>
<p>Even grenades and mortar rounds have found utility in clearing
<br>
avalanches along mountain highways and at ski areas.
<br>
<p>Many major medical advances first appeared in military hospitals, and
<br>
funded by military research dollars. Virtually all we know about head
<br>
and body trauma comes from military research. Penicillin became mass
<br>
produced for military use in WWII. The appearance of superglue for
<br>
sealing skin wounds first appeared in military triage units. Military
<br>
dollars currently pay for much research into artificial blood and
<br>
cryoprotectants (if you can cool or freeze a wounded soldier at an over
<br>
capacity military hospital, you can handle the flow of wounded cases
<br>
over a longer period with less staff) and this will find use not only
<br>
in cryonic suspension, but in disaster and emergency management.
<br>
<p>Then lets go to the other extreme: Titan ICBMs were adapted to
<br>
launching satellites and probes, from the Gemini capsules to the
<br>
Voyager probes to current day launches of the Cassini and Galileo
<br>
probes, communications and weather satellites, etc. Even the actual
<br>
nuclear missiles that sat for many years in silos have been recycled to
<br>
use in space launches.
<br>
<p>Ihave no doubt that other newer ICBMs can be similarly recycled. For
<br>
example, the Conestoga rocket's first two stages are Minuteman engines.
<br>
<p>Jet engines were developed specifically for military use, yet found
<br>
civilian applications. Stealth materials have found use in the auto
<br>
markets for drivers who want to avoid traffic tickets. Submarines are
<br>
used in many civilian applications from scientific research to tourism
<br>
to luxury yachting (<a href="http://www.ussubmarines.com">http://www.ussubmarines.com</a>). Sonar has found use
<br>
in underwater archaeology (Titanic) and treasure hunting (The Atocha),
<br>
as well as recovery of recently wrecked vessels and planes (recall the
<br>
hunt for TWA800, as well as JFK Jr's plane). Underwater listening moved
<br>
from military use to scientific in listening for whalesongs and
<br>
tracking marine mammals and other sea life. Armored units are
<br>
frequently used in riot control and bank transfers. Cryptography.
<br>
Business jets. Semiconductors. The list goes on to future applications:
<br>
high energy lasers, developed for Strategic Defense, can find use
<br>
propelling interplanetary and interstellar spacecraft.
