<em>&gt; Do Mike and the others really expect a knock on the door---or worse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the door being violently broken in---someday soon when &quot;they&quot; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taken over?  Why is my name in credit card databases any kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat to me?  My name is on public record in a number of places
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in California; the county land records, the state income tax board,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Department of Motor Vehicles.  I don't feel threatened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should I?
</em><br>
<p>Just a few years ago, the wife of the President of the US, and her
<br>
liberal cronies in and out of congress, had publicly labeled me and
<br>
millions of other law abiding Americans as terrorists and threats to
<br>
national security. All of this went on while some on this list who have
<br>
been extremely vocal about the Patriot Act recently were either
<br>
strangely silent, or actively cheering Hillary on. Sucks when the shoe
<br>
is on the other foot, doesn't it? Do I think these people will learn
<br>
their lesson? Fat chance.
<br>
<p>Given things like the &quot;Know Your Customer Act&quot;, which mandates that
<br>
your banker act as an informant on your financial activities, I no
<br>
longer keep a bank account. I pay cash for everything, especially ammo,
<br>
subversive books, and other gear.
<br>
<p>I don't like the Patriot Act. There, I said it. However, I don't like
<br>
foreigners infiltrating and attacking us even more. I don't like people
<br>
immigrating here under false pretenses as sleeper agents more than
<br>
that. The only concerns I have about the Patriot Act are that it will
<br>
survive the GOP hold on the White House and the DNC will use it to
<br>
launch an inquisition against law abiding American citizens like myself
<br>
who don't fit their politically correct view of the world. I have no
<br>
such fears about the Bush administration doing so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some people who can't think clearly at all and have no sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective already consider the U.S. the most repressive tyranny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in history, the worst imperialist power, and the genocide champion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of all time.  So forgetting about them, who else thinks that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a significant chance that the U.S. will become as repressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as China currently is, or Spain under Franco?
</em><br>
<p>Depends on which party is in power. The GOP can never accomplish this,
<br>
specifically because their members are a minority in the US while
<br>
Democrats are a majority.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Remember the astonishment of the Soviet visitor to Spain in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1960's when he saw a photocopier in plain sight inside a Madrid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; office building?  Such, of course, was absolutely impossible in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S.S.R., so I'm not asking about the U.S. going Nazi or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stalinist---I'm just asking about something relatively mild.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you expect things to get worse and worse and worse?  Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foresee Ashcroft and those like him arresting people for political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dissent, censoring radio and television?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think so. We've already had treasonous behavior from the likes
<br>
of Sean Penn, who has repeated the acts of Hanoi Jane from a generation
<br>
ago. He is still walking around and casting for movies. Reps Bagdad
<br>
Bonoir and Jim McDermott, ditto, and they are still congressmen.
<br>
<p>I think Bush and Ashcroft see it as a political advantage for these
<br>
boobs to act as extremely anti-war as possible. When we march into
<br>
Iraq, liberate the people, and expose all of Saddam's crimes and WMD's
<br>
to the world for scrutiny, those who opposed the war the most are going
<br>
to look extremely foolish come election time.
<br>
<p>There is no repression like public humiliation.
