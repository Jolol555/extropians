Hi Extropes,
<br>
<p>The following article from Science magazine (7 March) 
<br>
describes how some progress in embryonic stem cells
<br>
research may still be achieved in the US despite legislative
<br>
restrictions.

<p>JAMES BATTEY PROFILE:
<br>
NIH's Man in the Middle of the Stem Cell Debate
<br>
Constance Holden
<br>
<p>&quot;...
<br>
With researchers eager to push ahead and politicians worried
<br>
about moving too fast, NIH's James Battey is trying to strike
<br>
a balance on this controversial topic James Battey knows that
<br>
he works in a fishbowl. As head of a National Institutes of 
<br>
Health (NIH) panel managing stem cell research within the 
<br>
bounds established by the Bush Administration, Battey hopes
<br>
to satisfy researchers who want to extend the scientific frontier
<br>
without incurring the wrath of politicians who raise the specter
<br>
of &quot;human embryo farms.&quot; Last week, the House of 
<br>
Representatives reiterated its solid opposition to both 
<br>
reproductive and research cloning with human embryos. It
<br>
voted for a total ban on nuclear transplants to create early 
<br>
human embryos, which the White House embraced immediately
<br>
in hopes of persuading a divided Senate to follow suit. But the 
<br>
241-155 tally in favor of a ban didn't rattle Battey. Six months 
<br>
into his stint as the government's point person on the issue, the
<br>
50-year-old cell biologist appears to be obeying his political
<br>
masters without losing the respect of his peers. &quot;He's the one 
<br>
who's trying to make the science work,&quot; says stem cell 
<br>
researcher John Gearhart of Johns Hopkins University in
<br>
Baltimore, Maryland. &quot;I think he's in our corner, but it's a very
<br>
narrow corner.&quot;
<br>
<p>Not many researchers are familiar with Battey, a 15-year NIH
<br>
veteran whose full-time job is director of the National Institute
<br>
on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders. Well 
<br>
regarded for his research on G protein-coupled receptors 
<br>
before moving into administration, Battey was tapped by NIH 
<br>
Director Elias Zerhouni to head up a task force that would 
<br>
implement the president's decision to limit federal support to 
<br>
stem cell lines derived before 9 August 2001 (Science, 17 
<br>
August 2001, p. 1242). The 14-member internal panel 
<br>
(stemcelltaskforce.nih.gov) includes prominent stem cell
<br>
researchers Ronald McKay and Mahendra Rao. It also 
<br>
receives advice from working groups of extramural grantees
<br>
that include top researchers such as James Thomson of the 
<br>
University of Wisconsin, Madison, and Irving Weissman of 
<br>
Stanford University.
<br>
<p>Science visited Battey at NIH last month during the area's 
<br>
seemingly endless winter to see how he's holding up. 
<br>
Blue-eyed and athletic, he looked as though he had just
<br>
breezed into the office after a morning of snowshoeing. He 
<br>
was railing against the cumbersome and--he believes--
<br>
ineffectual code orange security precautions at NIH in a tone
<br>
that suggested a low tolerance for bureaucratic niceties. 
<br>
&quot;Someone could drive a truck over a curb&quot; or come in on the
<br>
weekend without being hassled, he scoffed.
<br>
<p>The first priority for the task force, Battey explains, is to beef
<br>
up the number of researchers trained to work with human 
<br>
embryonic stem (ES) cells. &quot;There are probably no more than
<br>
30 to 40 principal investigators,&quot; he says. &quot;I could see the field
<br>
growing five- to 10-fold over the next 5 years.&quot; To prime the 
<br>
pump, NIH is offering training funds to established 
<br>
investigators, short-term training courses for novices, and
<br>
&quot;administrative supplements&quot; for researchers to add ES cells to
<br>
their portfolio.
<br>
<p>..
<br>
<p>The next big step is to characterize the available cell lines. 
<br>
(Last November, Battey reduced the number of approved cell 
<br>
lines listed on the NIH registry from 74 to nine after weeding 
<br>
out those not available for proprietary reasons or because they
<br>
hadn't yet been cultured.) Battey says he plans to advertise this
<br>
spring for two researchers and two technicians to analyze the
<br>
lines that are actually available to researchers. McKay, who 
<br>
will oversee the effort, says the aim is to provide &quot;an
<br>
information resource&quot; for scientists seeking the best methods 
<br>
of cultivating particular cell lines. He says he has obtained six 
<br>
cell lines so far and expects to have 10 by the end of the year
<br>
as more approved lines become available.
<br>
<p>Another adviser to the task force, Leonard Zon of Children's 
<br>
Hospital in Boston, applauds this move, saying that 
<br>
&quot;characterization of the lines as they currently stand is insufficient&quot;
<br>
for choosing which line to pick for a given experiment. &quot;You don't
<br>
even know which lines are genetically stable.&quot; Adds Battey, &quot;It's
<br>
been assumed that cell populations grown from the same 
<br>
blastocyst are similar if not identical.&quot; But detailed gene analysis
<br>
might show them to be &quot;very different.&quot;
<br>
<p>Characterization won't solve a deeper problem: There may be
<br>
too few cell lines to satisfy NIH-funded researchers. Many 
<br>
would agree with Gordon Keller of Mount Sinai School of 
<br>
Medicine in New York City, another working group member,
<br>
who thinks &quot;additional lines will be necessary in the not-too-
<br>
distant future&quot; to provide greater genetic variation. Battey 
<br>
disagrees. &quot;We need several years of research before we even
<br>
need to think about more lines,&quot; he says.
<br>
<p>In the meantime, he sees NIH's &quot;infrastructure&quot; grants for 
<br>
ramping up stem cell production--eight groups in the United States
<br>
and abroad have been funded to date--as a way to stimulate the
<br>
field. He admits that some may take a while to bear fruit since 
<br>
using some lines that are currently frozen (including those at the 
<br>
Karolinska Institute in Sweden) may await new cultivation
<br>
techniques.
<br>
<p>Battey also takes a more optimistic stance than his
<br>
nongovernmental colleagues on the potential effects of a ban on 
<br>
research cloning, should the Senate follow the House's lead.
<br>
Research on diseases won't be severely hurt if the government 
<br>
blocks human cloning technology, he says: &quot;I think we are many,
<br>
many years away from having the knowledge we need to make
<br>
such [alarmist] statements.&quot; Battey argues that the most
<br>
important good from human embryo cloning would be 
<br>
knowledge of how to reprogram a cell's nucleus--and &quot;those 
<br>
kinds of lessons can most easily be learned in animal models.&quot;
<br>
<p>Despite their differing views, observers seem to feel that Battey
<br>
is the man for the job. NIH and the task force are &quot;doing as well
<br>
as they can within the constraints,&quot; says Keller. According to
<br>
Zon, &quot;What was needed was to have someone take charge and 
<br>
make sure stem cells were available to researchers.&quot; By doing
<br>
that, he says, Battey's task force is serving the community well. &quot;
