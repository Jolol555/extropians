<p>
Back in the 70's a friend convinced me to do the EST training, created and
<br>
promoted by Werner Erhard. (Anyone remember EST?) Some say Erhard was a
<br>
charlatan, and charlatan he might very well have been, (I'm not going to
<br>
defend him against those accusations), but I will say on his behalf that he
<br>
was big believer in spreading positive memes.
<br>
<p>In about 1977 I signed my name to his &quot;Hunger Project,&quot; which was
<br>
essentially a project designed to spread the meme that famine in the world
<br>
could be and would be eradicated by the year 2000. Needless to say it didn't
<br>
happen; there is still famine in the world in 2003. But as I recall hundreds
<br>
of thousands of people signed their names to the project of spreading that
<br>
meme. I have no doubt that it made at least a slight impact on the problem
<br>
of world hunger. 
<br>
<p>Anyone in those days who, like me, was willing to agree that world hunger
<br>
was a solvable problem, and who was willing to sign his or her name to the
<br>
idea and spread it to others, would have been more likely to vote and act
<br>
and donate accordingly.
<br>
<p>I'd say the most successful meme of the 20th century was &quot;human rights.&quot;
<br>
There really was no such thing as &quot;human rights&quot; at the turn of the last
<br>
century. Now almost every nation in the world acknowledges the idea as
<br>
&quot;real,&quot; though some still do not abide by it. I'm not a democrat or a
<br>
liberal, but I applaud Jimmy Carter for the key role he played in spreading
<br>
this meme and helping to make it real in the world.
