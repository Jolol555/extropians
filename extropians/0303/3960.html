<em>&gt; While all of this fun discussion is going on, I'd like to say a few words 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as leveraged altruism goes, nothing is within the same league

</em><br>
<p>Oh, quite true!  Say that there is even a 1% chance of a singularity
<br>
in the next ten years.  That still totally dwarfs everything else,
<br>
when the weighted average is reckoned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I really don't see why rational discussion would tend to 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>;-)  I notice that this discussion is not about &quot;Rulers and Famine
<br>
in Poor Countries&quot; any more.  So, even though it's quite contrary
<br>
to custom, I will actually change the name of this thread!  I
<br>
should change it to &quot;Obesity&quot;, of course, since that thread is
<br>
about everything.    /end mini-rant
<br>
<p>You want to know why rational discussion is about other things?
<br>
Okay, so what are the reasons that we post thoughts?
<br>
<p>Please, anyone, order the following in terms of priority 
<br>
for the most people:
<br>
<p>We discuss things in order
<br>
<p>&nbsp;1. to express ourselves on ideas we find intriguing
<br>
&nbsp;2. to be entertained
<br>
&nbsp;3. to provoke people into giving us desired criticism
<br>
&nbsp;4. to help solve the world's problems through memetic evolution
<br>
&nbsp;5. to show off (how much we know or how smart we are)
<br>
&nbsp;6. to expose folly, untruths, and mistaken opinions
<br>
&nbsp;7. to obtain a social outlet
<br>
&nbsp;8. to hear about new ideas
<br>
&nbsp;9. to address the most important questions facing us as individuals
<br>
10. to seek the truth
<br>
<p>See if you can get the right answer, that is, the right order!
<br>
Win a prize!
<br>
