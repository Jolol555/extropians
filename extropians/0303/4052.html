&nbsp;How does Palladium work?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically Palladium attempts to let the computer user prove to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remote computer what program he is running locally.  It achieves this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through a rather complex system involving cryptography, secure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hardware, and special extensions to the operating system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the remote server will download some data to the user, but only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a program which it knows will observe the Digital Rights Management
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (DRM) rules built into that data.  The user can use Palladium to prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the remote system that he is running one of the programs which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; follow the DRM rules.  In this way the transfer can go forward on terms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are mutually acceptable to both parties.
</em><br>
<p>### Thanks for the explanation. This is by itself a good idea, it makes
<br>
error-free content copying a hassle, but not impossible (at least in the
<br>
case of text), so there is some balance between the copyright holder and the
<br>
user - if the owner has too high demands, he will get pirated, but the
<br>
reasonable ones will have users willing to pay what they see as reasonable
<br>
fees.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, if this type of hardware became mandatory, the situation
<br>
would be very bad - you would be barred from owning general-use computing
<br>
devices, and the owners would have extreme advantage over users. A very,
<br>
very bad idea.
<br>
<p>Any solution must provide a balance between the short-term interests of
<br>
content providers and content users (which are at cross-purposes), to
<br>
achieve maximization of long-term gains for both. The optimal balance point
<br>
changes with time, due to technological progress (MP3) and can be influenced
<br>
by political pressures (e.g. DMCA). This is bad, because it limits
<br>
efficiency of the system. In a discussion here with Lee Crocker I once
<br>
outlined a system of dynamic copyright where the provider would buy an
<br>
injunction against copying from an enforcing/distribution agency (one of
<br>
many competing ones), for a fee depending on the cost of enforcement. The
<br>
cost would increase exponentially with time and the number of copies made,
<br>
so that the price of subsequent copies would be automatically lowered or
<br>
else piracy would make further enforcement impossible. Of course, the
<br>
customer would also have the choice of enforcement companies, with varying
<br>
fee structures and varying schemes for monitoring compliance (with different
<br>
levels of intrusion into the user's life). The enforcement companies would
<br>
develop a set of multilateral agreements on supporting each other's content
<br>
portfolios, but they couldn't push their cooperation too far, or else new
<br>
entrants would simply disregard their agreements and live fully off pirated
<br>
stuff. The effective copyright duration would not be set as a law, but would
<br>
emerge from the interaction of large numbers of players, and would depend on
<br>
the type of content (e.g. music copyright would very quickly become
<br>
unenforceable, but only after providing the producer with income
<br>
proportional to the number of copies made, while copyright on abstruse
<br>
technical handbooks would stay longer, because of the smaller number of
<br>
users who would be most likely willing to pay more per copy). This would be
<br>
a dynamic, free-market scheme for balancing the two sides, similar to David
<br>
Freeman's competing private court system.
