<em>&gt; It has always been truth that big smoking holes could be created without

<em>&gt; leaving a contrail back to the guilty party.
</em><br>
<p>False in fact, except for a very local meaning of &quot;always&quot;. By my 
<br>
reckoning, big smoking holes only became possible around the time of Alfred 
<br>
Nobel. 120 years does not equal &quot;always&quot;. I'd say the threshold for 
<br>
&quot;borrowed time&quot; was somewhere in the 1960s-1970s, considering the curve of 
<br>
weapons-grade nuclear materials unaccounted for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; terrorism.  But it is pointing out that the way to reasonably peaceful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and free future is not through eliminating all possible threats 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regardless of how we ourselves act.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but.
<br>
<p>Exaggeration. &quot;Eliminating all possible threats&quot; is the kind of handwaving 
<br>
I use myself when I'm in florid upset over some matter--absolutism for 
<br>
rhetorical effect, equivocation. I agree absolutely with what you say, in 
<br>
the abstract. I do not think, however, that &quot;regardless of how we ourselves 
<br>
act&quot; is a fair assessment of the situation. There are a lot of things that 
<br>
suck about past actions, and there are some things that suck about present 
<br>
actions. Glittering generalizations shed heat, but not light.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, we can march into and take over any country we consider to be run by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creeps and other wise leaders and peoples should do the same heh?
</em><br>
<p>The absolute categorical-imperative relativism of your rhetoric makes 
<br>
actual communication about this very difficult for me. I am not sure there 
<br>
is a good choice; you are sure that the US is just as bad as everybody 
<br>
else, if not worse. I don't know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wonderful.  The utter rule of might and the prejudicies and fears of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments.
</em><br>
<p>No, the utter rule of &quot;play nice or get spanked&quot;. I don't like it, but it's 
<br>
not hegemony of the level exerted by Stalin or even any of the Caesars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Doesn't these seem like a buge step toward oblivion to you?
</em><br>
<p>I am, as I have said repeatedly, not sure. I think the risk of oblivion is 
<br>
high either way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When it comes to creeps we have empowered and supported some of the worst 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on earth, including Saddam.
</em><br>
<p>We have supported some baddies, and that is not good; and I am not sure 
<br>
they were &quot;some of the worst on earth&quot;. I think this is more exaggeration, 
<br>
but I can't prove you wrong. Was Diem really exactly as bad as Ho Chi Minh? 
<br>
Maybe. I don't think the guy we propped up in Cambodia was anywhere near as 
<br>
bad as Pol Pot. I understand the sentiment here, and I share it to a 
<br>
greater degree than you probably believe I do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So sovereignity is absolute for those with the most guns and lite for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone else heh?
</em><br>
<p>No, the notion is that if you, as a strongman leader of some non- 
<br>
established player on the world stage, haven't built a web of trust, and 
<br>
you present a high profile risk, you take a serious risk of being 
<br>
neutralized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or in terms of rights and equality, &quot;some are more equal than others&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Strawman. You're hashing individual rights with the metaphor of 
<br>
leaders==countries==individual citizens of countries. The notion that all 
<br>
national governments are of equal standing is a fictive construct only 56 
<br>
years old in the context of the UN. As you probably know, it has its oldest 
<br>
embodiment in a document created by a Pope to formally end a century of 
<br>
religious wars in Europe. It has great value (convenience) as long as 
<br>
everyone plays nice. But WWI was supposed to be the war to end all wars, 
<br>
and it wasn't. The UN was a lash-up raft floated at the end of a grinding 
<br>
war. We've been lucky it lasted this long. I hope that a rapprochement 
<br>
remains possible. Rejecting options other than the raft is ignoring the 
<br>
ocean because of the sharks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a formula for global insecurity and war.  All of our &gt;human goals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are likely to be toast for at least a generation if we go down this road. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider very deeply the consequences of what you propose.
</em><br>
<p>I do not propose it. I relate it and explore my thinking about it. I don't 
<br>
see a formula for global security and peace popping its head up and asking 
<br>
to be introduced. I don't like either of the realistic outcomes I see as 
<br>
the high likelihood ones. I wish I could wave a wand or distribute some 
<br>
sort of Matrix pill to everyone in the world, including me. But I don't see 
<br>
that happening. All of our human goals mght be toast if people freak out 
<br>
after the first big smoking hole, too.
<br>
<p>I hope that we'll do a better job of rewarding the play-nicers, too. That 
<br>
would involve somehow taming the rapacious go-go nature of successful 
<br>
corporate culture. Maybe we *do* need a time-out. I know that's heresy for 
<br>
the Extro list, but look at how we're handling what we have. I'm in a 
<br>
pretty pessimistic mood today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether there is a paradigm shift is up to us in a country supposedly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; representing the will of its people.  We cannot simply sit back and allow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dangerous shift.  Not if we care about our lives and future.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
