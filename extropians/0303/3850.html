- GET RID
<br>
<em>&gt; of BUSH
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &amp; FUKU KASS GO WITH HIM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems there has been a subtle swing in the list away from supporting
</em><br>
Bush's war.
<br>
<p>Being opposed to Bush's bioethics panel does not connote an anti-war
<br>
opinion, troll.
<br>
<p>YOU made this connection, troglodite. Ahh flame instead of intelligence, can
<br>
you get on a Jerry Springer Show?  Are you capable of controlling your
<br>
primordial instincts and engaging in reasonable debate? At the bottom of it,
<br>
we agree on many fundamental issues.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People are starting to realize that war abroad means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic and liberty deprivation at home.
</em><br>
<p>Mike: Incorrect. One prominent American Muslim recently wrote in an op-ed
<br>
piece, &quot;I would rather live under Bush and Ashcroft at their worst than in
<br>
any of the petty tyrannies of the muslim world at their best.&quot;
<br>
<p>Absolutely agreed - but A. this is (obviously) a non-sequitur argument and
<br>
also illogical - A. ILLOGICAL: My Assertion: Bush admin reduces liberty
<br>
relative to other possible admins in US - Your rebuttal: Bush is better than
<br>
Caesar, Pinochet, Sadaam, etc. ad infinitum and that therefore my assertion
<br>
is wrong - logical failure - doesn't follow. Isn't this clear? B. AGREED!
<br>
Here is def. preferred to living under any of the 3rd world fascist gov'ts
<br>
we support, have supported (the Shah, Sadaam, Pinochet, Somoza, etc.) DOES
<br>
THIS MEAN WE SHOULD GIVE UP OUR LIBERTIES IN THIS COUNTRY?
<br>
B.
<br>
<em>&gt; The moves against ANY cloning are also good wake-up calls. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ashcroft &amp; Bush have their way,
</em><br>
<p>Mike: Actually, any individual going to Gitmo must first be a non-American,
<br>
<p>Ascroft wants the right to strip Americans of their citizenship by executive
<br>
action.
<br>
<p>and secondly belong to an organization that is actively engaging in
<br>
terrorism.
<br>
Defined HOW &amp; BY WHO? Who defines &amp; what constitutes &quot;belong to&quot; Who defines
<br>
how tenuous the &quot;relationship&quot; can be? Why shouldn't the US court system be
<br>
used to make these determinations? The Ashcroft bill is not open to abuse,
<br>
it is DESIGNED for abuse.
<br>
<p>Mike: Any international cloning treaty will only apply to signatory nations.
<br>
Bush: &quot;you're with us or against us&quot;
<br>
Me: Countries cave in diplomatically for MANY reasons.
<br>
<p>Founding an independent nation is really the ONLY real solution to the
<br>
threat from luddites of all persuations (not just those of the right).
<br>
MIKE - this assertion sounds like it was made by a &quot;terrorist&quot; - can you see
<br>
this? I agree with you, but you are talking either succession or taking over
<br>
a foreign country -
<br>
ASSERTION: the religious right in this country is a tremendous threat to
<br>
scientific liberty &amp; inquiry - do you agree? ASSERTION: the religious right
<br>
has a great deal of power over the current admin, court appointees, etc.
<br>
DOES IT NOT FOLLOW that the current admin is a great threat to scientific
<br>
inquiry &amp; liberty?.
