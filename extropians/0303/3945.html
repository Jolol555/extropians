From: &quot;Hal Finney&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Spacetime/Inflation/Civilizations">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose we are going to flip a biased quantum coin, one which has a 90%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance of coming up heads.  We will generate the good or bad experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depending on the outcome of the coin flip.  I claim that it is obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is better to give the good experience when we get the 90% outcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the bad experience when we get the 10% outcome.  That's the assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will start with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now consider Tegmark's level 1 of parallelism, the fact that in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently large volume of space I can find a large number of copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of me, in fact copies of the entire earth and our entire visible universe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the &quot;Hubble bubble&quot;?).  When I do my quantum coin flip, 90% of the copies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will see it come up heads and cause the good experience for the subject,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 10% will see tails and cause the bad experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will also assume that my knowledge of this fact about the physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe will not change my mind about the ethical value of my decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to give the good experience for the 90% outcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now the problem is this.  There are really only two different programs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being run for our experimental subject, the guy in the simulation.  One is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good experience and one is bad.  All my decision does is to change how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many copies of each of these two programs are run.  In making my decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about which experiences to assign to the two coin flip outcomes, I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chosen that the copies of the good experience will outnumber copies of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bad experience by 9 to 1.
</em><br>
<p>### One way of avoiding the conundrum is to use Rawl's veil of ignorance,
<br>
put yourself in the position of the experimental subject, and consider one
<br>
additional option - not flipping the coin at all. You can decide to run the
<br>
good experience only, giving the test subject a certainty of good experience
<br>
(limited only by your lack of knowledge about varous interfering factors,
<br>
computer glitches, etc.). The test subject if asked about the correct way to
<br>
run the experiment will insist on skipping the coin flip. From this it
<br>
follows you should not use the random coin flip as an addtional source of
<br>
uncertainty, because in this way you reduce the expected utility of your
<br>
actions, both as measured by local Bayesian inference and as a measure of
<br>
outcomes over the infinite number of your level I copies. The same reasoning
<br>
applies to level II.
<br>
<p>In level III there is the additional wrinkle of your actions causally
<br>
influencing the quantum evolution of the whole experimental system.
<br>
Basically, when making the decision you decohere into three versions, or
<br>
sheaves of histories - the no-coin-flip, the choose-90% and choose-10%
<br>
histories (the last sheaf of  histories is equivalent to you turning into a
<br>
sadist, I think). Your subjective experience of making the decision is the
<br>
equivalent of a quantum process of decoherence, whose outcomes will have
<br>
different measures depending on the properties of the system (your brain).
<br>
If your brain is influenced by my words, on the classical level, it will be
<br>
accompanied by an increase in the measure of branches with the no-coin-flip
<br>
experiment on the MWI, or level III analysis. In this case the the
<br>
conclusion is still the same as in level I and II, you should skip the flip
<br>
and choose good, in accordance with Tegmark's statement that level III does
<br>
not increase the number of distinct entities (or types of particle
<br>
configurations) compared to level I and II. There will be also an infinite
<br>
number of level I copies of you decohering into the three sheaves, but
<br>
without a direct causal relationship to each other.
<br>
<p>My intution is to give the sentiences you are responsible for the best
<br>
experience you can give them, if you decide to produce them, and the
<br>
decision to run them should be also acceptable to the sentiences
<br>
themselves - if you know that they will not be willing to live and be happy
<br>
even with the best you can offer, you should not make them at all. As aside
<br>
to Lee,  you are also not duty-bound to make them in first place.
