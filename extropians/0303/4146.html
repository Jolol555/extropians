Andrew Grygus of Automation Access published a 50+ page report on
<br>
February 23rd 2003 entitled &quot;2003 and Beyond -- Technology trends that
<br>
will affect your business and how you do business.&quot;
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.aaxnet.com/editor/edit029.html">http://www.aaxnet.com/editor/edit029.html</a>
<br>
<p>This is a big detailed report, heavy going at times, but well worth the
<br>
effort to digest. It will give you a frightening and eye-opening look at
<br>
Microsoft's public plans over the next decade.
<br>
<p>Using research and news articles from hundreds of different sources,
<br>
it is an in-depth, ten-year look at information technology in general
<br>
and Microsoft in specific.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;This article is a guide to trends that are already in full motion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and well known by technology specialists, but are far from
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;obvious to most business managers.&quot;
<br>
<p>A few tasters, just to raise your eyebrows :-)
<br>
<p>--------------------------------
<br>
Longhorn - Big Changes for Windows
<br>
<p>The very disappointing uptake of Windows XP has convinced Microsoft they
<br>
must force upgrades. License 6 does force customers to upgrade on
<br>
Microsoft's schedule, whether they want to or not, but a majority of the
<br>
market has not adopted License 6, despite Microsoft's threats. Clearly
<br>
drastic changes are needed to Windows to generate renewed upgrade
<br>
revenue.
<br>
<p>The successor to Windows XP (due in 2004, and rapidly slipping to 2005)
<br>
is currently code named Longhorn, and it will not be compatible with
<br>
your existing software, hardware or methods. Microsoft has already
<br>
stated that backward compatibility will not be a design feature.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------
<br>
Microsoft Office
<br>
<p>Office 2003 and Windows Server 2003 will include a Rights Management
<br>
Services feature for document security (W25). If Microsoft can convince
<br>
businesses to use this feature, Office 2003 documents will be completely
<br>
unreadable by OpenOffice / StarOffice, WordPerfect Office, Lotus, and by
<br>
all older versions of Microsoft Office, forcing a total upgrade of
<br>
Windows, Office and the computers it runs on.
<br>
<p>Office 2003 will not run on Windows 95, 98, 98SE or Me. Microsoft is
<br>
very clear that it will run only on Windows XP and Windows 2000 with SP3
<br>
(Service Pack 3) applied (W17). Currently over 60% of Microsoft's
<br>
business customers are still running Windows 95/98, and would have to
<br>
purchase all new computers for an XP upgrade - new computers soon to be
<br>
obsoleted by Longhorn and Palladium.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
The PC Industry
<br>
<p>The PC industry was once thriving, driven by rapid innovation. It's now
<br>
down and it's not coming back.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------
<br>
The Software Industry
<br>
<p>The PC software industry is in the final days of being destroyed by
<br>
Microsoft.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------
<br>
<p>That's enough. Have a good read!
