<p>Thanks!  We'll see if I can keep it up.  List volume is way too high, and I
<br>
keep getting embroiled in politics which burns me out after a few exchanges...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Do Reagan and the bushes acknowledge the legitimacy of liberal

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you kidding?  Of course not.  They're politicians.  To them,

<em>&gt; the opposition isn't to be hated; it's merely the total and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious Opposition.  They don't think anything like normal
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I buy that politicians are a breed distinct from ordinary people.
<br>
Distinct from your better scientifically-minded types, and perhaps different
<br>
than the norm, but I see a continuum.  And I don't think all politicians are
<br>
categorically at one end.  Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch being personal friends
<br>
implies an acceptance of the Other which I think includes legitimacy of the
<br>
opposition.  The Senate is often considered the seat of gentlemanly we'll get
<br>
along-ness, everyone having a voice, vs. House behavior of &quot;we have a
<br>
majority!  we'll crush you like a bug!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm trying to unearth psychological differences between normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left leaning people and normal right leaning people.
</em><br>
<p>It feels like you're trying to do so to the disfavor of the left-leaning
<br>
people, whereas I would do so to the opposite.  Perhaps that's just our own
<br>
biases showing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Lenin is not part of the memetic history of most US liberals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Really, he's not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is why I think Lenin is.  Remember: unlike the far right,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which was totally crushed in 1945, the far left was never totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repudiated.  Observe who the sponsors and organizers of the world-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wide recent peace protests are.  At every turn you find old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communist organizations at the forefront, no matter how many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-Communist liberals are attracted to the marches.
</em><br>
<p>1) Note I later distinguish between liberal and left.  It's vague, but a first
<br>
distinction I'd suggest would be between quasi-social democrats -- so I'm not
<br>
weaseling by using the classical liberal sense of liberal, which wouldn't
<br>
match popular usage -- and those who really do harken to Communism.  I don't
<br>
think labor unions and welfare advocates in the US have any necessary heritage
<br>
to Lenin; Marx was not the source of all socialist thought, let alone Lenin.
<br>
Never mind repudiation; Communism was never that popular in the US, Marxists
<br>
in the ivory tower notwithstanding.
<br>
<p>2) I think the collapse of the Soviet Union was as repudiating as the
<br>
crushing of the far right in 1945.  It wasn't total?  Well, neither was the
<br>
crushing.  Turn left and you see old Communist organizations.  Turn right and
<br>
you see new fascist organizations -- Le Pen, Haider, various neo-Nazis.
<br>
Anti-Semitism isn't totally dead (even factoring out anti-Zionism, mistakenly
<br>
called anti-Semitism) and rabid nationalism springs eternal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's not.  In terms of memes, organization, strategy, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlook, they're heirs of Lenin.  You can follow the very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear evolution of all the memes, slogans, and phrases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from &quot;People's This&quot; to &quot;People's That&quot;, right down to 
</em><br>
<p>I grant you this keeps cropping up, like swastikas.  But this discussion
<br>
started regarding the alleged liberal media bias.  I don't think Dan Rather
<br>
has a useful mental pedigree going to Lenin, People's Republic of Berkeley
<br>
notwithstanding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Concerned Citizens for This&quot;, &quot;Concerned Citizens for That&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>That's Leninish?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The path leading from Vladimir Lenin to Noam Chomsky couldn't
</em><br>
<p>Noam isn't Dan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Ever since, many on the left appear to believe that they possess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a special dispensation from God or someone to have pre-eminence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in political matters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And the right doesn't have this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not in quite the same way.  I'm excluding the shrill voices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're liable to pick up on the airwaves these days, from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, and I'm excluding the religious types who really do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that God's on their side.  I'm focusing on a large
</em><br>
<p>!!!!  You're excluding much of what I think of as the right!  And much of what
<br>
seems to have influence (or at least be reflected) in the Republican Congress
<br>
and White House.  &quot;Let's compare everyone on the left, out to Noam Chomsky,
<br>
but leave off anyone on the right beyond Nelson Rockefeller because they're
<br>
too extreme.&quot;  Not fair.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; note the asymmetry.  There is no way that &quot;young conservatives&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or whatever could have ever evolved the &quot;Political Correctness&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint.  Inconceivable.
</em><br>
<p>Anti-patriotic?  Un-American?  Communist?  Socialist?  Conservatives
<br>
might not have evolved the &quot;political correctness&quot; label, but they have the
<br>
dogmatic suppression of dissent down pat, in my experience.  Did you mean
<br>
something else?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet the self-doubt of liberals is a reality.  It comes from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of sources.  The fall of communism is the biggest one,
</em><br>
<p>Whereas I'd say the self-doubt of liberals comes from the Enlightenment, from
<br>
scientific thinking.  You're supposed to doubt yourself, or at least be open
<br>
to questions about your ideas.  And you certainly can't be certain of your
<br>
ideas because you don't *get* certainty, unless you're doing math.
<br>
<p>Take me, for example.  I used to be pretty libertarian; I've been turning
<br>
leftwards economically, based on what I consider the evidence.  Leftward
<br>
meaning social safety net, public funding of education and infrastructure and
<br>
research, the usual mixed economy stuff.  The fall of the Soviet Union is
<br>
exactly irrelevant to my beliefs.  But I had doubts as a libertarian, and I
<br>
have doubts now as a liberal, just because economic issues are so complex, and
<br>
my economist father taught me not to take economic theory too literally or
<br>
simplistically.
<br>
<p>More generally, there's this value of tolerance (or &quot;otherness&quot; cf. Brin),
<br>
which I associate with liberalism, but I could grant to the better
<br>
conservatives too.  It wasn't in the Soviet Union, and it's not in the
<br>
rabid religious right, and it's at best confused in the politically correct
<br>
crowd.  But there's this idea that everyone counts, everyone should be
<br>
listened to, if briefly, no one should be condemned out of hand.  And I think
<br>
is what I meant when I first brought up liberal self-doubt.  Liberals as I see
<br>
them have trouble cohesively keeping out the Other, or accepting doing so.
<br>
There's some of it in practice -- &quot;he's a gun nut from Texas&quot;, &quot;she's
<br>
pro-life&quot; -- but still, I see a moderation, absent from religious crusaders,
<br>
which leaves the left confused.  &quot;How do we talk to these people?  Can they be
<br>
talked to?  Maybe we should write them off.  No, no, that's Wrong!  But they
<br>
write us off as Wrong and Evil.  What to do?&quot;
<br>
<p>I think that last paragraph wasn't ideally written, but it'll have to do.
<br>
<p>For the record, I was raised by liberals, went libertarian for a long time,
<br>
and most of the people I know wander around the liberal-libertarian political
<br>
space.  On the left I speak from experience.  People from the right I don't
<br>
experience much, except in the media and politics, where they scare me.
