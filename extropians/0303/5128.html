<p>
Humania decided:
<br>
&lt;&lt;So what? WW1 WW2, Kaiser Wilhelm or Adolf Schittelgruber...In both cases
<br>
teachers called for a support of a criminal patriotism that lead to major
<br>
desasters. In spring 2003 Berlin kids *organised themselves* via cell phone
<br>
alarm a ralley against a criminal US killing campaign and were given support
<br>
by *a lot* of their teachers.&gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>No difference the Kaiser and Adolph? Now I see why you view things is black 
<br>
and white. The kinder,  have been brainwashed to *organize themselves* vis a 
<br>
vis the encouragement of their teachers, plus Fischer and Schroder. How come 
<br>
the kiddies never raged against Saddam or Osama? Answer: because they (your 
<br>
kinder) have been taught to hate Americans (as a German cultural norm) rather 
<br>
then a murderous dictator, or a Islamic fanatic. That of course is your 
<br>
choice, and you may please yourselves :-) 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Basically your Remarque analogy is not only deadly wrong but a fine
<br>
illustration of White House induced paranoia that seems to poison the
<br>
atmosphere here on the list.&gt;&gt;  
<br>
<p>The analogy is perfect since the teachers involved themselves in their 
<br>
students political views, and encourage them to have an anti-war protest. I 
<br>
have long believed that their has been a wrong relationship between 
<br>
Deutschland and America, before this list existed, or W Bushes shadow ever 
<br>
crossed the White house lawn. What you and a couple of others say, is that 
<br>
you feel the atmosphere is poisoned because we do not concurr with your 
<br>
views.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In both historical cases - WW1 + 2 -  sick patriotism seemed to cause a 
<br>
diminishing of intelligence. The same seems to be true today concerning your 
<br>
&quot;P3&quot;, your &quot;proud 'n' pray patriotism&quot;. Collateral brain damage might be an 
<br>
appropriate name for it. I find it disgusting that some of you folks think it 
<br>
worthwhile to condemn liberal German teachers and students because of their 
<br>
peaceful attitude. 
<br>
<p>Wake up and let's face it: this time YOU (plural) are the bad guys with your 
<br>
P3&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>It wasn't patriotism that was sick, it was Envy that was part of the 
<br>
culture/psychology that was sick. Even sicker than envy is the sense of 
<br>
Superiority that was (and is?) part of the cultural mentality. Combine Envy 
<br>
with a sense of Superiority, and well, then one looks for 'scapegoats'.  As 
<br>
far a P³ goes' I never pray, I do rather like my nation-state, America (or 
<br>
Amerika if you prefer) and have been deeply concerned for a long while when 
<br>
other nation-states, have exploited us. My understanding is that our elected 
<br>
officials, and our non-elected officials in the State Department, and the 
<br>
Commerce department, have encouraged this exploitation. (more on this later!)
<br>
<p>German liberal teachers with peacful attitudes are merely self-serving 
<br>
isolationists who hate the US (oh! Never the people, only the government!) 
<br>
never voiced an objection against Saddam, the Islamists, the old Soviets, the 
<br>
Yugoslavians committing genocide on your own back door; but find voice to 
<br>
scream with rage at das Ami's. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Wake up and let's face it: this time YOU (plural) are the bad guys with 
<br>
your
<br>
P3&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ok. Saddam, the Baathists, the Islamists; are all good guys and the Americans 
<br>
(P3) are evil. Let us treat this as fact. Now, given the fact that we are so 
<br>
wicked ( a thought experiement here) what can be done about it?  Boycotts? 
<br>
more Protests? Cold Water enema's (my favorite!)
<br>
<p>May Cthulu guide your path with his Holy Shogoths
