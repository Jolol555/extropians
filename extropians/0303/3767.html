<em>&gt; Power Americana
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Paul Reynolds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; BBC News Online world affairs correspondent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excellent analysis here from the BBC.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2801349.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/2801349.stm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In September 2000, as Mr Bush was running for the presidency, the New
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American Century team produced a report called &quot;Rebuilding America's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Defences&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;As the 20th Century draws to a close, the United States stands as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's pre-eminent power,&quot; it said.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Having led the West to victory in the Cold War, America faces an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity and a challenge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does the United States have the vision to build upon the achievement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past decades?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does the United States have the resolve to shape a new century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favourable to American principles and interests?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [What we require] is a military that is strong... a foreign policy that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boldly and purposefully promotes American interests... and a national
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leadership that accepts the United States' global responsibility.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><p>Which American interests are those?  The ones that throw a large 
<br>
number of people in jail for victimless crimes of deciding to 
<br>
put something in their body that some suppossed &quot;public servant&quot; 
<br>
or gaggle of such does not like, to the tune of more tha one 
<br>
million citizens?  Those American nterests that have sought out 
<br>
virtual slave labor conditions to produce goods cheaply all over 
<br>
the world?  How about those that have used 3rd world countries 
<br>
as sewers dumping toxic chemicals because it was somewhat more 
<br>
profitable to act that way and because they could?  Those who 
<br>
have used true terrorism including assasinations, economic 
<br>
sabotage, mass disinformation, bombing infrastructure to topple 
<br>
dozens of governments world-wide that might not be efficient 
<br>
cogs in our global machine?  Do we want to export and 
<br>
universalize American values such as talk of the rights and 
<br>
freedoms that we ourselves have long not really had?
<br>
<p>Where in the hell do we get off anyway believing that America 
<br>
has all the right answers for ourselves and for everyone else on 
<br>
earth?  Our wonderful Constitution and Bill of Rights?  Some of 
<br>
our federal judges publicly say those documents and the 
<br>
principles they attempted to apply to government are utterly 
<br>
irrelevant to them.  Please tell me exactly what we have got a 
<br>
firm grasp on ourselves that is so wonderful that we must (by 
<br>
force if necessary) be sure everyone on earth has it too.
<br>
<p>The above quoted material is talking about establishing an 
<br>
Americang global Empire.  It is pure Imperialism - something we 
<br>
used to say we weren't about.  Note very carefully the change in 
<br>
attitude and ask if it is really what you believe in and want 
<br>
yourself and your country to be known for.
