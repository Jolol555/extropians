<p>
Amara, I recognize the frustration. In this case, I think the
<br>
issue is Italian bureaucracy and culture rather than anything
<br>
more general. I think we simply have a too north-European
<br>
approach to administration to handle the surrealism of
<br>
Italian-style administration. I vividly recall the confusion
<br>
among senior neuroscientists and graduate students alike when
<br>
we were trying to figure out the rules regulating our lunch
<br>
cupons during a one-month neuroscience course in Trieste. And
<br>
that was something trivial, hardly the important issues you
<br>
describe. 
<br>
<p>Much of this trouble is because we do not understand the
<br>
important subtexts. What laws can (and should) be ignored? When
<br>
is the proper response a gift? Italy strikes me as based on
<br>
informal social relations managing a horrendously baroque
<br>
formal system that would not work if people actually obeyed the
<br>
letter of the rules. While in Sweden and Germany the rules are
<br>
relatively sane and are intended to be followed; here informal
<br>
relations are not welcome
<br>
<p>It is well worth considering that Italy has a higher cultural
<br>
power distance (50 in Hofstede's study) than Germany (35) and
<br>
Sweden (31) (USA: 40) and a higher uncertainty avoidance
<br>
(Sweden 29, USA 46, Germany 65, Italy 75). At the same time
<br>
individualism is higher (Germany 67, Sweden 71, Italy 76, USA
<br>
91). So following rules and authorities is very important, but
<br>
one acts as an individual.
<br>
<p>Being an immigrant can culturally cause trouble in lots of ways
<br>
when culture dimensions do not match up. Then add issues of
<br>
language, local racism and bizarre institutions. Even in the
<br>
best of worlds there would be problems.  But we can work to get
<br>
rid of Festung Europa an any case - it is both immoral and
<br>
impractical.
