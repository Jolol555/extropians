<p>My first serious girlfriend was from a missionary
<br>
family that spent 8 years in Africa.  Both of her
<br>
parents were doctors.  They could regale one for
<br>
hours with their experiences.  A few of the highlights:
<br>
<p>The missionary group was from Loma Linda California,
<br>
attached to the medical school there.  American
<br>
doctors spend their careers mostly examining perfectly
<br>
healthy bodies, but the medical school convinces the
<br>
students that an African tour of duty is their one
<br>
chance to save lives, to make a real difference.
<br>
<p>The parents graduated in 1965, at which time my girl
<br>
had just finished first grade.  She had a four month
<br>
old sister when the family left for the mission,
<br>
intending a two-year hitch.
<br>
<p>The highlights:
<br>
<p>They were based in Rhodesia but worked in other
<br>
countries as well.
<br>
<p>They would go into the smaller villages and if
<br>
it looked like a good place to set up shop, they
<br>
would appeal to the states for funding, ship in
<br>
materials for the locals to build a school and
<br>
clinic.
<br>
<p>Results were mixed.  Often much of the building
<br>
material would not make it to the back country,
<br>
being lost or stolen in route.  The civil war
<br>
in Rhodesia was getting started by that time.
<br>
The locals often turned out to be unsuitable
<br>
construction workers: they had a far too casual
<br>
outlook on life, wouldn't show up on time, wouldn't
<br>
show up consistently, would wander off the job in
<br>
the middle of the day, wouldn't build to any
<br>
semblance of the plan, didn't understand the
<br>
english measurement system, etc.
<br>
<p>Cement was one material that was notoriously
<br>
difficult to get delivered.  One church was
<br>
planned in which most of the blocks made it,
<br>
some of the glass, a little of the cement and none
<br>
of the wire.  The locals cheerfully proceeded to
<br>
build the block walls with one part cement to
<br>
5 parts sand and 10 parts mud.  Rains came, locals
<br>
took refuge in church, church collapsed.  Injuries
<br>
taken in stride, locals cheerfully restacked blocks,
<br>
ready to repeat the experiment.
<br>
<p>There was one case where a clinic was built by a
<br>
group of students.  They left, returning four
<br>
years later.  The building was gone, not a trace
<br>
of it remaining where it had once stood.  It is
<br>
still unclear if the building was stolen without
<br>
a trace or if they just couldn't find the site for
<br>
some reason.
<br>
<p>Baby formula classic example.  This scenario played
<br>
out countless times: American student goes into
<br>
Africa with a camera, takes photos of starving babies,
<br>
shows the photos in a big wealthy church, mothers cry,
<br>
throw large sums into the offering plate, bottles and
<br>
formula are purchased, sent to Africa, mixed with the
<br>
local water, the babies with insufficiently developed
<br>
immune systems devour the formula, get amoebic disentery,
<br>
perish of diarrhea-induced dehydration.
<br>
<p>Those that survive that get a second hit. What should
<br>
have been a year's supply of baby formula lasts only
<br>
a few weeks.  Perhaps some of the young mothers were
<br>
devouring the baby formula.  Under the circumstances
<br>
I suppose one could scarcely blame them.  Perhaps some
<br>
of the formula was stolen and traded for tobacco, rum,
<br>
bullets.  The young African mothers stop lactating as
<br>
they switch to formula.  Formula runs out, babies starve.
<br>
<p>The idealistic young medical students are driven to a
<br>
nervous breakdown, because they cannot seem to get
<br>
the locals to MOVE!  The locals won't jump to a clock
<br>
over there.  Pretty soon the students beg for a work
<br>
crew to come over and BUILD something, before their
<br>
hitch is over.  Often the result is much mutual
<br>
frustration.
<br>
<p>The only ones who do any good at all are those who
<br>
can get over the culture shock, and even that minority
<br>
sometimes get a fresh shock.  Case in point: my girl
<br>
was 6 when they went to Rhodesia, infant sister, two
<br>
more sisters born in Africa.  The two-year hitch stretched
<br>
to 8 years, and the civil war was getting hot, so it
<br>
looked like they would need to vacate.  It came to a
<br>
head when a neighboring white rancher and his teenage
<br>
son came to visit.  His father took her father aside and
<br>
asked if his daughter could be engaged to the rancher's
<br>
son.  At this suggestion, the missionary was nearly
<br>
speechless.  &quot;BETROTHED?!&quot; he sputtered, &quot;She's FOURTEEN!&quot;
<br>
<p>Upon hearing this, the rancher immediately apologized
<br>
and withdrew the suggestion.  Upon leaving, the three
<br>
younger sisters were playing beside the house.  The
<br>
rancher looked at them and commented &quot;I am surprised,
<br>
Doctor.  She certainly doesn't look fourteen.&quot;  It wasn't
<br>
until that moment that the girls' father realized that
<br>
the man was asking for the hand of his *second* daughter,
<br>
then only eight years old.  The fourteen year old was
<br>
too old.  They vacated within two weeks, enduring
<br>
a new round of culture shock upon landing in 1973
<br>
California.
<br>
<p>But I digress.  spike
