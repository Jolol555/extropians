<br>
all just relax and enjoy.
<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you just spoke a mouthful.  You are right I was merely asking 
<br>
someone to give specifics instead of making broad accusations.  But, above 
<br>
and beyond that you said, &quot;We've got such a good thing going here.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to that so called debate that some find objectionable -- during the 
<br>
Vietnamese war the peace movement caught all of us unawares.  We had never 
<br>
seen such a movement in this country.  Few of us ever dreamed that the peace 
<br>
movement was an organized movement dedicated to defeating the US.  For 
<br>
reference I offer you David Horowitz, etal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, this time around we are playing on an old playing field.  We 
<br>
go on line and find the various &quot;boot camps&quot; for teaching people to organize. 
<br>
&nbsp;We find the home sites of the groups sponsoring the so called peace rallies, 
<br>
then we track them backwards to see who their sponsors are for a level or 
<br>
two.  I don't want to over emphasize this segment of the peace movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead I want to say that, more importantly, we have seen and heard 
<br>
the peace movements arguments before and are ready to respond to them.  All 
<br>
those years ago the only news media we had was CBS, ABC and NBC with Walter 
<br>
Cronkite, etc., all leading the charge for the peace movement.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few days I have heard the ranting against the right wing 
<br>
media.  The good thing is that at long last we are not restricted to hearing 
<br>
just one side.  We hear and get ammunition from both sides.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me cut to the chase.  We have something new and different here 
<br>
than what existed during Vietnam.  We have two sides with equal access to 
<br>
movement tactics, strategy and facts.  So long as the one side wants to stay 
<br>
and propagandize the other side will stay and argue the points brought up.  
<br>
So yes, we will respond to a rant by asking for specifics.  If we are 
<br>
answered with a further rant we will recognize that fact and respond 
<br>
appropriately.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I disagree with some of you, even my friends, in that I don't hear 
<br>
Greg as wielding a heavy hand, I hear him asking for voluntary action.  But I 
<br>
also agree with him on the his asking for voluntary action.  The attempt to 
<br>
proselytize for the peace movement on this list results in a Mexican standoff 
<br>
as both sides are here in sufficient strength to keep anyone from dominating 
<br>
the discussion.  On the other hand we do have other areas where we could be 
<br>
making progress -- but it has to be voluntary, IMHO.
<br>
