Fortean1 quoted:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The ICT's few dozen Hollywood recruits are a somewhat random representation 
<br>
of
<br>
the entertainment industry, a tiny fraction of the thousands who labor there.
<br>
They offer some ideas in the form of short films that illustrate proposed new
<br>
equipment, or video games for training. Other proposals come as drawings and
<br>
mock-ups of futuristic tanks, uniforms and helicopters. 
<br>
<p>Among the ideas they have proposed -- and even designed -- as possible 
<br>
solutions
<br>
to problems posed by military planners: 
<br>
<p>• Modular tanks that come apart for transport by plane and can be reassembled 
<br>
on
<br>
arrival. 
<br>
<p>• Roman-style shields mounted on skateboards and stored on the sides of 
<br>
tanks,
<br>
to be used to conceal a soldier crossing an urban street while under fire. 
<br>
<p>• Lightweight  uniforms with inner reinforcement to create exoskeletal armor. 
<br>
<p><p>• Insectlike  electronic sensors that can move around and relay information. 
<br>
<p>• Robotic &quot;mules,&quot; or unmanned ground vehicles, that carry soldiers' 
<br>
equipment
<br>
and sense enemy movement. 
<br>
<p>While the buglike sensors sound like something straight out of  Steven
<br>
Spielberg's &quot;Minority Report&quot; (in which mechanical spiders set out to detect 
<br>
a
<br>
cowering Tom Cruise), not all of these ideas remain in the realm of the
<br>
imagination. 
<br>
<p>Production designer Ron Cobb's sketch for the robotic mule was at first 
<br>
greeted
<br>
with skepticism by Army brass. So he was surprised (and not a little 
<br>
flattered)
<br>
to learn a few months ago that the Army had asked Boeing to figure out how to
<br>
build a vehicle that looked exactly like his design. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This was a pretty intense article, especially the part (snipped by me) 
<br>
concerning the bridge incident and the rioters in Serbia. The Serbians seemed 
<br>
not to realize how lucky they really were! The notion that we are at a phase 
<br>
where, at least, a large fraction of science fictional concepts; can actually 
<br>
make it to the real world is nice.  Unfortunately, American Business boards 
<br>
of directors, who allegedly are interested on providing new goods and 
<br>
services to the consumer, are never so insightful as the US Army. No surprise 
<br>
there. So very few new products get produced, because of the insistance of a 
<br>
quick quarterly return. Maybe non-public companies are the most resourceful? 
<br>
No nagging stockholders to respond to, just like the Army.
<br>
<p>Back to concepts; the ever conceptual, Popular Mechanics has a moveable, 
<br>
artificial, island concept, that would be used as a Island-sized aircraft 
<br>
carrier. It would rise 120 feet over the ocean, and be about 1000 feet long 
<br>
(or greater). It would be powered by diesel generators, and require no new 
<br>
technology to construct. It would supposedly travel at a mere 15 knots per 
<br>
hour, but basically arrive as a major means to project power, in a 
<br>
long-simmering situation. From the drawing, it looks like you could sink it 
<br>
with a sizeable nuke, but nothing smaller.
