</em><br>
<p>I read a fair bit of African history last year.  The colonies tended to be
<br>
self-supporting, which meant there wasn't much too them.  This is the century
<br>
of laissez faire, after all.  Not much lost, not much money gained, not much
<br>
enthusiasm for getting more colonies. 
<br>
<p>Then there was a sudden land grab and division of Africa, apparently motivated
<br>
mostly by keeping other Europeans out of Africa, just in case.  Think of it as
<br>
a stock market bubble of imperialism.  Note African didn't get properly carved
<br>
up until the late 19th century; the &quot;empires&quot; were pretty short lived there,
<br>
compared to the British and Dutch in the far East, or the Spanish empire in
<br>
the Americas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; strength to, and secondly, maintaining or extending
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunate side-effect.
</em><br>
<p>Unless you've played Diplomacy, or read history, and fear a
<br>
&quot;gang-up-on-the-leader&quot; effect, especially if the leader looks aggressive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in Iraq would require an extended stay by the Coalition (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; at least U.S.) forces.  But the longer the stay, the more this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is a case of liberal imperialism.
</em><br>
<p>Tangent:
<br>
I'd just like to note the many uses of the word 'liberal'.  We argue over
<br>
liberal bias in the media, and castigate liberal policies domestically, but in
<br>
international affairs, bam, guess what we are... this first hit me years ago,
<br>
when I read a Nation article condemning globalization, and then a Business
<br>
Week article extolling the liberalization of the world.  Business Week a
<br>
liberal magazine?  Well, internationally...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evidently his intuition is that Iraq could become democratic, were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the occupying power sufficiently idealistic and willing to pay what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever is required to achieve that goal.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the US has ever been anywhere near sufficiently idealistic, nor
<br>
is it willing to pay whatever price, especially now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I infer that in this case you're opposed to liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialism because it won't work.  You seem to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this particular Arabic country at this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time cannot be other than it is; basically, a backward
</em><br>
<p>Second sentence doesn't follow the first.  The basic method of liberal
<br>
imperialism might be flawed, without any comment on the country we're
<br>
attempting to liberalize.
<br>
<p>Then someone will mention Germany and Japan, so okay, it's more complicated
<br>
than that.  But Germany and Japan were aggressor nations which got utterly
<br>
smacked down.  We're trying to avoid the utter smackdown, and the Arabs have a
<br>
big sense of pride, and from what I see in the news they're just getting
<br>
angrier at us... well, never mind the details.  But the fact that liberalism
<br>
by force worked in a couple of extreme cases doesn't mean it'll work here.
<br>
Not because the Iraqis can't deal with democracy but because most people won't
<br>
take being liberalized by force, Germany and Japan notwithstanding.
