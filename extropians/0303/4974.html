From: &quot;Olga Bourlin&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20[POLITICS/IRAQ]%20Thank%20God%20for%20the%20death%20of%20the%20UN%20%20(Article)">fauxever@sprynet.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><p><p>You see a man standing on a street corner shouting praises to an unseen
<br>
supernatural savior.  The man truly sees/believes that he is receiving
<br>
messages and is in communication with said savior .... is he dishonest?
<br>
<p>I think that's one of the big problems people have with Bush.  His
<br>
credibility is in question not necessarily because he is dishonest, but
<br>
because he exhibits an intractable religious zeal.
<br>
<p>Here is one observation:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.counterpunch.org/cook02222003.html">http://www.counterpunch.org/cook02222003.html</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I know I am experiencing an out of phase moment with the
<br>
rest of the world when I find myself reading a post by Olga
<br>
and nodding in agreement.
<br>
<p>Reading her link I have to comment further.  Perfectly sane responsible
<br>
people will react with horror at the thought that America might
<br>
&quot;betray&quot; Israel.  I know my parents voted for Bush (and will
<br>
likely vote for him again) precisely because of his religous
<br>
rhetoric (if rhetoric it be).  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Course these are people who believe (strongly) that what 
<br>
happened to the Nazis was God's warning to America to Never
<br>
Ever persecute his Chosen.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American suburbia is full of Boomers who believe this stuff.
<br>
It's perfectly OK to have invisible friends provided they speak
<br>
to you mostly on Sundays.  I do not know whether Georgius Secundus
<br>
is genuine, but *either* way his political personality is a
<br>
archetype, after the Clinton years many Americans are so relieved
<br>
to have &quot;someone who isn't ashamed to be a Believer&quot; they
<br>
couldn't really care less about the economy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;For instance.. my Mom recently commented that this economic
<br>
problems might very well be God's way of allowing Satan to &quot;test&quot;
<br>
the country and it's chosen Leader's commitment to a godly
<br>
national culture.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Bush makes the proper noises, doesn't get caught with his
<br>
pants down (literally) and feeds the military/industrial complex
<br>
whilst rembering to mention Yahweh frequently he is being
<br>
the essence of what his constituency desires....
<br>
<p>And that is.. ultimately.. the raison d'etre of a politician.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
Brian
