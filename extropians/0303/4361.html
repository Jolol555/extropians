<em>&gt; &gt; (And I can think of only two people I know of, for sure, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even appreciate it, or recognize its value at all.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Feh.
</em><br>
<p>What means this &quot;Feh.&quot; ?   ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the problem is, you and some other people take everything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so literally.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you are getting at.  I think that we see
<br>
implications in what is being written as well as you do; I
<br>
guess you haven't described well what you mean here.  (That's
<br>
okay!  If you've the time, keep trying!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally, I read pro-war stuff all the time, maybe not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite as much as anti-war stuff but still quite a bit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The impression I get is that most pro-war types -- at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least those on TV -- just don't even attempt to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the anti-war p.o.v.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, so are you saying that the anti-war &quot;types&quot; do a better
<br>
job of understanding *their* adversaries?  If so, to what
<br>
psychological difference do you attribute this capability??
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Steve Davies's post seemed to me a well-written summation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it didn't tell me anything I didn't know.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you totally missed my point.  My point is that
<br>
it's very valuable and extremely healthy to be able to 
<br>
describe the point of view of one's adversaries in a way
<br>
that they'd agree with.  This principle is even used in
<br>
psychology, as I understand it:  in the Rogerian method,
<br>
the analyst must be able to state the situation from the
<br>
patient's point of view to the utter satisfaction of the
<br>
latter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd wager many extropians (except me, I can't write) could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have assembled something similar and at least halfway decent.
</em><br>
<p>No, they literally could not.  As hard as they would try,
<br>
the basic unreasonableness of their adversaries point of
<br>
view---or at least what they see as so unreasonable---would
<br>
always leak through.
<br>
<p>Not only that, but my second point is even more important:
<br>
they never would even want to try.  Firstly, all too many
<br>
of them DO NOT BELIEVE that their adversaries point of view
<br>
*can* be expressed completely reasonably.  Secondly, even
<br>
if they could, they would see utterly no value in doing so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't write that well, and if I tried, I'd make it into a fantasy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenario where Iraq becomes a big airstrip for pre-bombing the rest of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the middle east.
</em><br>
<p>Ha!  Totally typical.  You are presenting a left-wing propaganda
<br>
scenario whose only point is to make the right-wingers look mad.
<br>
You have proven that you have no concept of what the words &quot;unbiased&quot;
<br>
or &quot;objective&quot; mean, nor how the concepts could be applied to writing.
<br>
<p>Here, for your edification, is the principle.  A piece of writing
<br>
is *unbiased* when you cannot determine the political orientation
<br>
of the writer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'd talk about pre-bombing (SAM sites, radars, stuff 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like that) even friendly countries and explain it as just preparatory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombing in case they can't stop their internal terrorist factories 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing us to do some bombing for real. I'd talk about how I think daily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombing should be part of any sanctions package. And I'd conclude with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying that I don't think we've given daily bombing enough time to work.
</em><br>
<p>Doubtless a fine piece of satire or parody, and there is 
<br>
nothing wrong with that!  ;-)
<br>
<p>But it completely misses the idea of this thread.
<br>
<p>Lee
