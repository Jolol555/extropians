<em>&gt; What is the emotional reaction of those protesting the war
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the last few days, there have been Coalition losses that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have made headlines.  Unexpected stratagems performed by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqis have resulted in American and U.K. tactical setbacks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (though not strategic ones so far as I can tell).
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't call a 300 mile advance in one week, the fastest advance in
<br>
hostile territory in military history, as a 'tactical setback'. I
<br>
wouldn't call a couple dozen allied casualties and a paltry few hundred
<br>
Iraqi civilian casualties, compared to thousands of Iraqi combatant
<br>
deaths and 4,000 Iraqi POWs, to be 'tactical setbacks'. I wouldn't call
<br>
the decimation of a command and control structure, the destruction of
<br>
all but three Republican Guard divisions (and those three one their way
<br>
to destruction), to be 'tactical setbacks'. Nor would I call the
<br>
wholesale takeover of multiple airbases within Iraq by allied forces
<br>
and the decision by the Iraqi Air Force to sit out the war to be
<br>
'tactical setbacks' for the allied forces.
<br>
<p>I find it rather amusing that so many are panicking when they see Iraqi
<br>
media, Bahrain division (al Jazeera) rebroadcasting the same footage of
<br>
a downed Apache and claiming it is another downed chopper, that they
<br>
hear reports that a suicide bomber took out one Bradley vehicle with a
<br>
minibus packed with explosives (when it turns out the Bradley was
<br>
unharmed outside of a paint job). I find it amusing that some here
<br>
believe the Iraqi propaganda that claims an Iraqi SAM returning to
<br>
earth and wiping out a market is a &quot;US missile attack&quot;.
<br>
<p>How much european coverage has been devoted to the fact that Iraqi
<br>
military is firing on Iraqi civilians who are only searching for food?
<br>
How much european or arab coverage has been noting that Iraqi soldiers
<br>
in chemsuits are unloading 50 gallon drums at artillery sites? 
<br>
<p>I actually have been watching some al Jazeera coverage. C-SPAN has
<br>
devoted some of its time to providing both al Jazeera and Iraqi TV
<br>
coverage. I must say that if al Jazeera is the muslim worlds idea of a
<br>
'free press', I am mightily disappointed. If the rest of the media in
<br>
the muslim world is anything like Iraqi TV, I can completely understand
<br>
why the muslim world is so royally fucked up. Being generally more
<br>
devout than westerners, they are types who tend toward seeing what they
<br>
believe and not the reverse. Muslim media only seems to serve up that
<br>
which the muslim world already believes, and seriously contorts the
<br>
truth into outright BS to support their religious and cultural
<br>
delusions.
<br>
<p>What the muslim world needs is a muslim equivalent of that Indian group
<br>
that is dedicated to debunking the fakirs and other religious scam
<br>
artists around India.
