<p>It doesn't matter, because he has in some sense transcended.
<br>
<p>Apparently he has delegated command (this is inferred from 
<br>
strategy and al-Jazeera analysis, so it is not certain of course) 
<br>
to his generals. Normally this would be suicidal for any dictator 
<br>
to do, and Saddam previously ran the standard ultra-centralized 
<br>
approach to government. But in his current situation this would 
<br>
actually delay the inevitable, and maybe give him time to get to 
<br>
his secret moonbase or whatever. If he can just keep out of sight 
<br>
he will be as invisible and invincible as Osama. He better not 
<br>
leave any smoking shoes on the slopes of Etna, of course... [Ob 
<br>
classicist reference]
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
To get this back into transhumanism (after all, otherwise this
<br>
issue shouldn't even be discussed on this list): This kind of 
<br>
&quot;immortality by delegation&quot; is actually interesting from a 
<br>
functionalist perspective. If you are defined by your function, 
<br>
by what you do, then you could actually be replaced by another 
<br>
external system doing the same functions. This is really what 
<br>
uploading is about. But as my colleauges have pointed out, why 
<br>
not replace myself by a set of very good actors? These actors 
<br>
would learn everything relevant about the behavior and 
<br>
motivations of me, and eventually take my place. My own argument 
<br>
against this is of course that many of my internal processes 
<br>
which are only (and can only be) privately known such as my 
<br>
consciousness, would not be transferred in such a scheme. But if 
<br>
I did not regard these processes as relevant, or thought that a 
<br>
bad upload-copy was better than no upload, then it might make 
<br>
sense. Similarly with Saddam; by having enough people acting as 
<br>
if he was alive and according to his will, he is in some sense 
<br>
uploaded within the social matrix of Iraq.
