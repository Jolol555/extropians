</em><br>
<p>Fun idea. To some extent it is the same thing as a spam contest - how to 
<br>
write spam that gets through the filters and filters that gets rid of 
<br>
the spam. Good exercise before building nanoimmune systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Winner of the P team is the one who writes the filter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which most effectively identifies the Ks porn while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; filtering the fewest non-porn articles.  The winning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; K is the one who writes the most provocative &quot;porn&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that makes it thru the most filters.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think this is slightly unfair to the P team, since it is 
<br>
unclear how to judge the filters while porn is in the mind of the 
<br>
beholder and can get really raunchy. As Tom Lehrer sings: 
<br>
<p>All books can be indecent books
<br>
Though recent books are bolder,
<br>
For filth (I'm glad to say) is in
<br>
the mind of the beholder.
<br>
When correctly viewed,
<br>
Everything is lewd.
<br>
(I could tell you things about Peter Pan,
<br>
And the Wizard of Oz, there's a dirty old man!)
<br>
<p>Maybe the ideal porn filter would be a program that actually had a dirty 
<br>
mind and hence could identify pornography?
<br>
<p>Statistically speaking, we have to weight the type I and II errors. Is
<br>
it worse to filter out a &quot;clean&quot; message than letting through a &quot;dirty&quot;? 
<br>
<p>For a real porn filter the goal ought to be to annoy the user so much
<br>
when trying to get to the porn that it is no longer fun, but where is
<br>
the fun in constructing something like that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually anyone could compete on both teams, writing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an essay and a filter.  This sounds like a fun little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise in creative writing, as well as surely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing some hilarious material.
</em><br>
<p>I would like to test out my neural nets on this later on, after I have
<br>
finished a certain dissertation (Aargh! It is alive! It grows without
<br>
bound! I have created a monster! :-)
