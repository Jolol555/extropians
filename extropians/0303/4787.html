<p>One of the reasons that Saddam hasn't been able to counter us effectively 
<br>
might just be the structure of his government.  An example: during the 
<br>
first Gulf War we were able to knock out his air force so easily because he 
<br>
deliberately made his countries airfields easy to attack, in fear of an Air 
<br>
Force coup.
<br>
<p>His command and control also has to be highly controlled since he knows 
<br>
that his military units aren't loyal to him, just afraid of him.  During 
<br>
the Iran/Iraq war his armor units weren't able to exploit breakthroughs 
<br>
since they weren't trusted to operate independently, so they were reduced 
<br>
to mobile forts.  Instead of the war looking like WWII as you would expect, 
<br>
it devolved into trench fighting like WWI.
<br>
<p>There probably are clever ways to thwart many of the technologies that we 
<br>
have used in this war.  Even in the Serbian air campaign our opponent was 
<br>
able to hide their vehicles and use decoys (which wouldn't have worked if 
<br>
they had to fear land invasion, admittedly).  But the Serbian government, 
<br>
say what you will about it, wasn't a police state.  Iraq is, and if they're 
<br>
leadership really has been decapitated we can expect their army to just 
<br>
keep following their last orders or surrendering until we march into Baghdad.
<br>
<p>A military that is run purely by command from the top will be as outclassed 
<br>
by a military that allow initiative as a command economy is by capitalist 
<br>
(or at least socialist) one.
<br>
<p><p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
