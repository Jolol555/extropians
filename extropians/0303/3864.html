&quot;People already addicted to food would be encouraged to increase consumption
<br>
further.  Thus exacerbating the food shortage which exists n many parts of
<br>
the world.  &quot;
<br>
<p>I dont consider the shortage of food in many parts of the world to be
<br>
related whatsoever to the food supply in general.  There is more food
<br>
produced and more food and calories per capita in the world than there has
<br>
ever been before.  The only reason it doesnt get to the places that most
<br>
need it is because they are typically ruled by corrupt despotic dictators
<br>
who dont care about their people.  Such a device would have little to no
<br>
effect on food shortages because of 3rd world tyrants.  In fact, it would be
<br>
better, becaue conspicuous consumption would increase demand, and production
<br>
would increase, and prices would drop further.  The cheaper food is the
<br>
harder it is to keep out of the hands of people.
<br>
<p>&quot;Burning more calories also does nothing to encourage cardiovascular
<br>
health.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course not, but lugging around pounds of lard does!  Besides, cancer is
<br>
most directly related to diet and obesity, and that kills far more people
<br>
(reduces the number of people-years) than cardiovascular disease.  Indeed,
<br>
the major and overwhelming successes we have had at combatting heart
<br>
diseases are the main reasons why cancer occurances are rising in the
<br>
postindustrialized west.  We have to die from something.
<br>
<p>&quot;The heart is a muscle and like any other muscle it stays in
<br>
tone by the training effect achieved by exercise. Too much cholesterol or
<br>
homocysteine in your system and you still may have plugged arteries. You may
<br>
look skinny but still die of a heart attack or stroke. &quot;
<br>
<p>So take it upon yourself to think of a device that will combat these issues,
<br>
artery srubbing implants, artificial hearts, etc. etc.  Or we could try
<br>
really hard to convince each and every single person in the world to eat
<br>
right and excersize...
<br>
<p>&quot;I guess what I'm saying is the benefits of good diet and exercise still has
<br>
many health benefits that outweigh just having a high metabolism.&quot;
<br>
<p>Absolutely!!! but having this calorie burner would be far better than being
<br>
grossly overweight.
<br>
<p>&quot;If people could stay skinny without eating right or exercising the net
<br>
effect might be more people dieing prematurely!&quot;
<br>
<p>Possibly, but I would consider that highly unlikely.
