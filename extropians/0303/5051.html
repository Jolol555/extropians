<p>
Apparently the eat-for-your-blood-type idea is part of a larger
<br>
'system' that a fellow named Peter d'Adamo created for
<br>
'nutrigenomics'.
<br>
<p>It sounds kind of gimmicky to me, but I really don't know anything
<br>
about area of work. Has anyone looked into this?

<br>
<p>What a catchy name for an institute! ;-)
<br>
<p>P.S.
<br>
sorry about the previous messages with a bad date - my laptop computer again..
<br>
continuing months in a temporary life (temp home, office, carrying my 
<br>
computer-that-needs-a-new-battery in my backpack etc.)
<br>
<p>==========
<br>
from that web page:
<br>
<p>Welcome to the IfHI-Online, the official website of the Institute
<br>
for Human Individuality (IfHI). IfHI is a 501c3 foundation whose
<br>
prime goal is to foster research in the in the expanding area of
<br>
human nutrigenomics.  The science of nutrigenomics seeks to provide
<br>
a molecular understanding for how common dietary chemicals affect
<br>
health by altering the expression or structure of an individual's
<br>
genetic makeup.
<br>
<p>The five basic tenets of nutrigenomics are:
<br>
<p>* Improper diets are risk factors for disease.
<br>
* Dietary chemicals alter gene expression and/or change genome
<br>
structure
<br>
* The degree to which diet influences the balance between healthy and
<br>
disease states may depend on an individual's genetic makeup.
<br>
* Some diet-regulated genes (and their normal, common variants) are
<br>
likely to play a role in the onset, incidence, progression, and/or
<br>
severity of chronic diseases.
<br>
* &quot;Intelligent nutrition&quot; - that is, diets based upon genetics,
<br>
nutritional requirements and status - prevents and mitigates chronic
<br>
diseases
<br>
<p>Under the guidance of Dr. Peter D'Adamo and the Research Faculty,
<br>
IfHI is committed to assuming a leadership role in this
<br>
fast-developing field of scientific inquiry.
<br>
<p>The essence of naturopathic medicine is its focus on each patient as
<br>
an individual, with unique characteristics in health and disease.
<br>
The principle that one treatment does not fit all patients suffering
<br>
from a given disease is fundamental to naturopathic practice. In
<br>
addition to exposure to pathogens, naturopathic physicians examine a
<br>
wide array of possible etiologic and contributing factors, including
<br>
diet and nutritional status, lifestyle choices, and stress.
<br>
<p>IfHI is partnered with the Southwest College of Naturopathic
<br>
Medicine (SCNM), a regionally accredited naturopathic medical school
<br>
and health sciences center. Through its relationship with SCNM, IfHI
<br>
can apply for research funding through such organizations as the
<br>
National Institutes of Health (NIH).
<br>
<p>It is the goal of IfHI to research the genetic influence on our
<br>
response to diet and nutrition and to develop new applications and
<br>
practices that allow this information to benefit humankind.
