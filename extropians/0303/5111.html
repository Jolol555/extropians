&quot;Sit down Michael&quot;
<br>
<p>Humania, you so eloquently miss the point yet again.  The point is not that
<br>
you should come to my conclusion after deep consideration, the point is
<br>
Teachers should be teaching children *how* to think, NOT *what* to think.
<br>
Do you disagree with that?
<br>
<p>Can a child of 13-16, who most people consider to not yet be an age of
<br>
informed consent, who most parents dont think can rationally choose to have
<br>
sex or not have sex *possibly* be considered to be making a decision of
<br>
informed consent regarding the issue of War in Iraq?   Hardly, though since
<br>
their knee-jerk teacher dictated reaction happens to coincide with yours,
<br>
you see it as a morally valid decision.  Ask anyone of them how many people
<br>
Saddam has killed in his reign and see if they have an Answer.  Ask them if
<br>
a pre-emptive strike is always morally invalid or is sometimes valid.  Ask
<br>
them what does morality mean to them?  Ask them if they value freedom, and
<br>
ask them if they prefer a world in which all people have freedom vs. one in
<br>
which only some do?  Ask them how they think it best to perpetuate freedom
<br>
to freedom-less countries.  Ask them what they think of a leader who rapes
<br>
and beats political opponents.  Ask them to define tyranny, despotism, and
<br>
oppresion.  Most adults can not be considered to have made an informed
<br>
decision on this conflict, and I seriously doubt these children, in germany,
<br>
were offered a bulleted pro / anti war list that they mulled over.
<br>
<p>I point to some members of this list who absolutely insisted that any and
<br>
all US led strike was immorral, even though they didnt even know what the
<br>
1994 UN inspections found thousands upon thousands of chemical weapons,
<br>
missiles, delivery systems, and growth media.  That is NOT representative of
<br>
an informed decision.
<br>
<p>Just because some teacher probably said to them 'War is killing, killing is
<br>
bad, US wants to start war' and then asked them if they thought this war was
<br>
a good idea and they responded 'no, war bad, lets go protest' doesnt make
<br>
thier position one that was the product of deep deliberation and informed
<br>
consent.

<p><em>&gt; Ron,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dont Dismay, Humania is just not familiar with the concept of coming to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational conclusion after studying in depth both sides of an issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, if the masses are brainwashed without utilizing a single critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking nueron, it's a'ok as long as it jives with his own idealogy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humania, the point Ron is trying to make is that Teachers should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing ideas onto children and students, they should encourage children
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; study questions, even difficult ones, and understand both sides of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments, and then make a decision based on a clear understanding of both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides, additionally, they should be able to acknolwedge when they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know enough to speak intelligently on a subject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With some 80% - 90% of the teachers in the US being liberals, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Teachers Unions donating to liberal campaigns, its not hard to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why so many students hate America, George Bush, and everything his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration does.  Its hard not to when it is drilled into you from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time you are a young child.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Humania:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;whats wrong with that&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Humania,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        You had a protest of perhaps a few dozen or a hundred teachers.
</em><br>
You
<br>
<em>&gt; proclaim it as a protest of thousands of students.  That is what is wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron h.&quot;
