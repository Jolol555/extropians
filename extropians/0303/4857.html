While my sigfile specifically singles out pacifists, I would say that
<br>
anybody who isn't taking personal action to fight tyranny is aiding and
<br>
abetting it by doing nothing. Pacifism is more than just an opinion or
<br>
an attitude, it is also a lack of action. In a spiritual sense, it is a
<br>
sin of omission.
<br>
<p>====Mike, from your statements above and below, I feel that your mind is a
<br>
sin of omission.  Seriously you need to give me some more evidence before I
<br>
can side with you on this one.  From my view you've made a few statements
<br>
about pacifism that don't match my own definition or what I would take as
<br>
the standard definition.  If you are creating a specialized definition then
<br>
that should be noted with some sort of asterisk in your &quot;sigfile&quot; and all
<br>
other places where you make reference to the concept.  
<br>
How is pacifism a lack of action?  It seems rather easy, at first glance, to
<br>
find numerous and reliable contradictions of the statement - &quot;Pacifism is
<br>
equivalent to in-action&quot;  Is making a decision a form of in-action?  Or more
<br>
broadly, can anything in existence be said to exist in a complete state of
<br>
inactivity? and on a human level could anyone say that another human mind
<br>
(except for your own:)) be absolutely and totally inactive?
<br>
Ghandi is widely seen to be a &quot;pacifist&quot;.  Would you claim that he was not a
<br>
pacifist? (Maybe he exhibited some form of passive-aggressiveness that moved
<br>
him from the pacifist camp to the instigator of violence camp?) If you do
<br>
agree that he was a pacifist would you then claim that he was in-active?
<br>
That Ghandi was aiding in tyranny?
<br>
Maybe you mean some special sort of inaction... in that case you would want
<br>
to make special note of it.  In this case the asterisk would again serve you
<br>
well to explain your own special definition of the concept &quot;action&quot;.  
<br>
It may be fun to play with words but sometimes this play leads to war.
<br>
Please let me know what your line of reasoning is here.  I'm, afraid of, but
<br>
curious to know the workings of a mind like yours.
