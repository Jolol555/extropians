<p>Interesting connection.

<p>*Exactly* right!  And it's entirely due to our stupid evolutionary
<br>
heritage in which we simply cannot imagine---no matter how rational
<br>
and how logically it's laid out before us I'm coming to fear---that
<br>
we can be 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B O T H
<br>
<p>uploaded and in the flesh.  One CAN be in two places at the same time,
<br>
just as one can be in two times at the same place.  Jeez.
<br>
<p>Look, *after* you've uploaded, think carefully about what you are
<br>
about to do when you terminate your million-times slower biological
<br>
self.  *Why* do it???
<br>
<p>Is it because you think that he'll be *so* devastated to slowly
<br>
realize that he's different from you and he's not uploaded?
<br>
Suppose, just suppose, that you are so up-to-speed by then that
<br>
you realize (and he realizes) that you and he are exactly the
<br>
same person.
<br>
<p>And that it's BETTER to be running in two places than one.
<br>
And that he's happy that he's you, and is already uploaded!
<br>
<p>So, as your symbolic finger hovers over the symbolic level that
<br>
will terminate your original's existence, wonder exactly why you
<br>
need that space to become less graced than it is.
