<p>Nah I deserve it.  Of the last three extropian pun-barfs,
<br>
I started two of them.
<br>
<p>This is a way cool thing, this whuffie rating.  I need
<br>
to know how it works.  Consider a chess rating, the so called
<br>
Elo.  This is a great system, because it doesn't have a long
<br>
memory.  A player can have a 1600 rating for 40 years, retire,
<br>
spend time studying up, play a couple of good tournaments, watch
<br>
her rating climb to 2000.  Elo isn't a long-term average, its
<br>
more a current performance with past rating as a starting
<br>
point.  It takes into account the Elo of your opponents,
<br>
more points given for defeating a higher rated opponent, etc.
<br>
Likewise if someone is a bad guy with a low whuffie, then
<br>
later gets religion and turns nice, there should be a way
<br>
for his whuffie to eventually recover.
<br>
<p>Hmmm, gets religion.  Ok, bad example.  He gets a brain
<br>
transplane and turns smart.
<br>
<p>This whuffie, does it take into account if one person really
<br>
hates you, can she grind your whuffie into the dust single
<br>
handedly?  What if someone loves everyone.  Shouldn't that
<br>
dilute the value of their positive ratings?  Same with the
<br>
guy that hates everyone.  Seems like there should be some
<br>
kind of limit to the amount of influence one can do to
<br>
another's whuffie, and it should balance overall so that
<br>
one's total influence has as much positive as negative
<br>
influence integrated over the group, and is directly
<br>
proportional to ones own whuffie.  Chess Elos work this
<br>
way, which is what prevents Elo inflation over time.
<br>
<p>If someone with a negative whuffie rates you negatively, then
<br>
the overall effect should be positive, right?  Of course then
<br>
those whose whuffies are neutral can have no effect on anyone's
<br>
whuffie.  Of course then it is tempting to intentionally
<br>
piss off those with low whuffies in order to get them to
<br>
rate you low, and a negative times a negative is positive.
<br>
There would be a constant love-fest among the high whuffiers
<br>
and a constant mutual battle among the low whuffiers.
<br>
Clearly the system is filled with curious self referential paradox.
<br>
<p>I *like* curious self referential paradox.
<br>
<p>Somebody explain how the system works, including equations please.

<br>
<p>ps Waaay cool post, Hal.   {8-]
<br>
<p>pss.  No, wait, Hal, you said your whuffie is negative.  Hmmmm.
<br>
Hal, you primitive savage!  I bet you compute on an Intel386
<br>
with OS2!
