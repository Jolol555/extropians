<em>&gt;Take your whuffie and shove it, or give it to Gina. After all the crap

</em><br>
<p><p>Hmm
<br>
<p>I'm part way into chapter 4 of Doctorow's book, but so far I haven't really
<br>
noticed - especially in the lead characters, how the desire to accumulate
<br>
whuffie might be characterized as a 'mechanism for behavior extortion'.
<br>
<p>The only example that springs to mind is when Lil wrinkles up here nose when
<br>
she learns that the notorious Keep-A-Movin' Dan, in a state of depression,
<br>
has shamefully allowed his whuffie to piddle away to nothing. But even so,
<br>
she's still awfully nice in offering him a place to stay while he gets back
<br>
on his feet, no?
<br>
<p>Perhaps I'm missing some huge forest for the trees, or maybe what you're
<br>
indicating develops later in the story?
<br>
<p>Anyhow why on Earth do you appear to be defending Gina to myself--the only
<br>
person on the list (so far as I know) who has effectively offered her a free
<br>
professional service in exchange for prior news-gathering excellence?
<br>
<p>Not to suggest I disagree with anything you wrote above, but you must be
<br>
having a bad hair day or something.
