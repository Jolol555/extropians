<p>It might be worth looking at the review of the social psychology

of suicide bombing (of course there is such a field) in the 
<br>
latest Science (Scott Atran, Genesis of Suicide Terrorism,

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemporary suicide terrorists from the Middle East are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;publicly deemed crazed cowards bent on senseless
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;destruction who thrive in poverty and ignorance. Recent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;research indicates they have no appreciable
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;psychopathology and are as educated and economically
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;well-off as surrounding populations. A first line of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;defense is to get the communities from which suicide
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attackers stem to stop the attacks by learning how to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;minimize the receptivity of mostly ordinary people to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;recruiting organizations.

<br>
<p>Plenty of interesting information (some of it surprised me a lot
<br>
and forced me to reconsider some of my views) and a discussion
<br>
of just how tricky it is to get rid of terrorism as an
<br>
institution.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He mentioned that while the USA endeavors to be a melting pot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (imperfectly at times, of course) no such endeavor is taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place in Europe though it has a growing moslem population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is basically frozen out of civil society.
</em><br>
<p>This is an important point. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just wondering if France is less prejudiced than other european 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations, anecdotal evidence being the long association with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Algeria, better assimilation of blacks than in most of US history, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the notion of 'frenchness' perhaps being less a function of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race/nationality than language/culture, and if all this is at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of French resistance to war w/ Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My only recent experience being in Norway, now with a growing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pakistani population, and the seeming guilt complex composed of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal parts Nordic racial superiority and strivings toward a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; socialist egalitarian utopia wherein noone is better than anyone 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else (one of the reasons I remain in the USA).
</em><br>
<p>&lt;rant&gt; Sweden is second place after Denmark in the category
<br>
&quot;worst immigrant integration&quot; in some studies; I think
<br>
Scandinavia on average is very bad at integrating new cultures.
<br>
To some extent it is due to a previously very homogeneous
<br>
population, but I think the institutions of the welfare state
<br>
makes things worse.  On one hand people should be helped
<br>
regardless of what they say and regardless of individual need,
<br>
on the other hand people that are arriving are a drain on the
<br>
system and hence not very welcome. And since the aim is to make
<br>
every immigrant just as well-off and integrated as the natives
<br>
(which of course fails) people are trapped in a Kafkaesque
<br>
bureaucracy until they become well integrated - which is usually
<br>
defined as being able to use the welfare system to subsist
<br>
(which means the case is out of the hands of the case workers).
<br>
Going to Sweden in order to get a new life, start a small
<br>
company and work? No, that is not allowed. The social
<br>
democrats and their union allies are firmly against immigration
<br>
of foreign labor until everybody within the land has work.
<br>
&lt;/rant&gt;
<br>
<p>Does this breed terrorism? No, it mostly breaks down people and
<br>
creates a class of low-class citizens that are dependent on the
<br>
system. Maybe a few of the second generation would be
<br>
radicalized, but it doesn't seem to be happening right now.
<br>
<p>I think France and other more central nations actually may have 
<br>
more prejudices, but the potential of becoming a real part of 
<br>
society there is larger for an immigrant.
