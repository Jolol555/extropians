<p><em>&gt; I must say that I am frightened about this war. I'm not a religious person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I find myself actually praying that Saddam does not have weapons of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction ready and available to use against our troops, against Israel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or Kuwait, and against his own people. If he really has WMD then it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be bloody hell.
</em><br>
<p>Good reminder.  Though the thought is that it's better now
<br>
than after he and his sons have ten times as many.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, the world community looks to us to set an example in international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relations. If we Americans assert that we have the legal and moral right to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launch a pre-emptive strike against vague theoretical threats like Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then what argument do we have to stop other countries from doing the same?
</em><br>
<p>The United States did not just wake up on September 12 of 2001 and
<br>
decide that Iraq was a problem.  U.N. resolutions *demanding* that
<br>
Iraq stop their behavior and disarm as they had agreed have been
<br>
going on for ten years!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why, for example, should China not launch a pre-emptive strike against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taiwan? And why not India against Pakistan or vice versa? And what about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; North Korea against its neighbors? If other countries follow our example
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the world is going to be in deep shit over the next several decades.
</em><br>
<p>Why have you forgotten that there has been no international
<br>
condemnation of Taiwan?  Why doesn't it come to mind that
<br>
Taiwan has not been the subject of countless &quot;resolutions&quot;,
<br>
did not invade anyone ever, has no interest in WMD, etc.?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And what about the UN? According to the UN, we're going to war illegally in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violation of the UN, supposedly because Iraq is illegally in violation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the UN. But wait... is the UN a world legal authority, or not? We can't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it both ways! 
</em><br>
<p>Well, neither can anyone else have it both ways.  Enough is
<br>
enough.  Personally, I see the U.N. as an only semi-effective
<br>
organizations for helping to focus world opinion, or as an
<br>
outlet for formalistic urges.  What did it do when Russia
<br>
overran Chechnya?  Where was it when the U.S.S.R. invaded
<br>
Hungary?  What about Yugoslavia?  Clinton and his friendly
<br>
allies didn't even bother to consult the U.N.  Did that make
<br>
the attacks on Serbia illegal?  What about Argentina's seizure
<br>
of the Falklands?  Where was the U.N.?
<br>
<p>Personally, I think that the U.S. has acted with incredible
<br>
restraint.  Perhaps this was prudent because of the low esteem
<br>
the socialist world has for conservative U.S. presidents---would
<br>
they have objected so if Clinton had still been in power, and did
<br>
to Iraq what he did to Serbia?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And that leaves Saddam *desperate*. He's backed into a corner, possibly with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his finger on the trigger of chemical or biological weapons, or worse. If I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were him then I would be thinking about how best to go out in a blaze of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; glory. Let's hope he doesn't really have the weapons that we accuse him of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, indeed, let us hope he has not.  Or at least that he
<br>
doesn't want to lose the support of France by using them
<br>
(snicker).  Why would you be happier letting 5,000 children
<br>
a month die in Iraq due to sanctions, and let Hussein continue
<br>
to murder thousands of his countrymen each year for political
<br>
reasons?  You are totally all right with allowing him to build
<br>
up a stockpile of weapons, and sooner or later sell them to
<br>
Al Qaeda?
