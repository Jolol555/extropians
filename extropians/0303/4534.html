<em>&gt;You support the unconditional removal of Bush for something he

</em><br>
<p>I suggest to look at all sides of the story, gather information
<br>
from as many sources as you can, and not to swallow, hook, line
<br>
and sinker what you hear coming from the White House and from
<br>
American media. It might help to put Iraq in perspective
<br>
with what is occurring elsewhere in the world, too.
<br>
<p>Practicing a healthy skepticism especially with regards to what
<br>
comes out of the mouths of politicians and especially when the
<br>
alternative is some thousands/more precious lives gone might
<br>
make it easier to look at oneself in the mirror in the morning.

<p>The legend of Saddam &quot;gassing its own people&quot; ?
<br>
von Kaas - 04.02.2003 00:28
<br>
<p>&quot; President Bush himself has cited Iraq's &quot;gassing its own people,&quot;
<br>
specifically at Halabja A War Crime or an Act of War? &quot;
<br>
<p>It was no surprise that President Bush, lacking smoking-gun evidence
<br>
of Iraq's weapons programs, used his State of the Union address to
<br>
re-emphasize the moral case for an invasion: &quot;The dictator who is
<br>
assembling the world's most dangerous weapons has already used them
<br>
on whole villages, leaving thousands of his own citizens dead, blind
<br>
or disfigured.&quot;
<br>
<p>The accusation that Iraq has used chemical weapons against its
<br>
citizens is a familiar part of the debate. The piece of hard
<br>
evidence most frequently brought up concerns the gassing of Iraqi
<br>
Kurds at the town of Halabja in March 1988, near the end of the
<br>
eight-year Iran-Iraq war. President Bush himself has cited Iraq's
<br>
&quot;gassing its own people,&quot; specifically at Halabja, as a reason to
<br>
topple Saddam Hussein.
<br>
<p>But the truth is, all we know for certain is that Kurds were
<br>
bombarded with poison gas that day at Halabja. We cannot say with
<br>
any certainty that Iraqi chemical weapons killed the Kurds. This is
<br>
not the only distortion in the Halabja story. &quot;

<p>Media Watchdogs Caught Napping
<br>
<p>By Leander Kahney  |   Also by this reporter  Page 1 of 1
<br>
<p><p>02:00 AM Mar. 17, 2003 PT
<br>
<p>In the run up to a conflict in Iraq, foreign news websites are
<br>
seeing large volumes of traffic from America, as U.S. citizens
<br>
increasingly seek news coverage about the coming war.
<br>
<p>&quot;Given how timid most U.S. news organizations have been in
<br>
challenging the White House position on Iraq, I'm not surprised if
<br>
Americans are turning to foreign news services for a perspective on
<br>
the conflict that goes beyond freedom fries,&quot; said Deborah Branscom,
<br>
a Newsweek contributing editor, who keeps a weblog devoted to media
<br>
issues.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>Jon Dennis, Guardian Unlimited deputy news editor, said U.S. readers
<br>
are visiting his site for the range of opinions it publishes, and to
<br>
engage in vigorous debate. Media outlets in the United States, he
<br>
said, are not presenting the issues critically.
<br>
<p>&quot;As a journalist, I find it quite strange that there's not more
<br>
criticism of the Bush administration in the American media,&quot; he
<br>
said. &quot;It's as though the whole U.S. is in shock (from Sept. 11).
<br>
It's hard for (the media) to be dispassionate about it. It seems as
<br>
though they're not thinking as clearly as they should be.&quot;
<br>
<p>Dennis charged that, unlike much of the American press, the Guardian
<br>
site presents both pro- and anti-war positions. In addition, the
<br>
Guardian encourages its readers to debate the issues, through the
<br>
site's talk boards and interactive features like live interviews
<br>
with various experts.
<br>
<p>The only debate in the U.S. media is on the Web, Dennis said.
<br>
&quot;Weblogs are doing all the work that the U.S. media did in the
<br>
past,&quot; he said. &quot;That's an interesting development.&quot;
<br>
<p>In fact, a lot of the Guardian's U.S. traffic is referred by
<br>
weblogs, especially Matt Drudge's Drudge Report, said Nielsen's
<br>
Goosey.
<br>
<p>&quot;The new war in Iraq has made world news sources far more
<br>
important,&quot; said Stephen Gilliard, who posts a lot of foreign news
<br>
stories to the weblog at NetSlaves. &quot;While not all news sources are
<br>
reliable, there is such a gap between the way Americans see the
<br>
world and the way other people do that it is invaluable to use these
<br>
resources.&quot;
<br>
<p>There is also a growing tide of criticism of the U.S. media from
<br>
members of the media, such as veteran CBS broadcaster Dan Rather.
<br>
<p>Rather recently complained to the BBC about the media's lack of
<br>
access to government officials, and the growth of &quot;Milatainment&quot;
<br>
reality shows on U.S. TV, including ABC's Profiles from the Front
<br>
Line and VH1's Military Diaries.
<br>
<p>New York Times columnist Paul Krugman wrote, &quot;(U.S. TV news) seems
<br>
to be reporting about a different planet than the one covered by
<br>
foreign media.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's not to say U.S. news outlets are devoid of criticism for
<br>
leaders' handling of the conflict in Iraq. Krugman himself is a case
<br>
in point, having published a column last week with an opening
<br>
sentence stating that &quot;America's leadership has lost touch with
<br>
reality.&quot;
<br>
<p>Barb Palser, online media columnist for the American Journalism
<br>
Review, believes that many visitors to foreign news sites are
<br>
finding their way through links from U.S.-based publications. She
<br>
cites the example of The Spokesman Review, a newspaper in Spokane,
<br>
Washington, which provides links to outside news services, many of
<br>
them overseas, as part of its Iraq coverage.
<br>
<p>Another source that may be pointing U.S. news junkies overseas,
<br>
Palser said, is Google. A search on Google News for the terms &quot;Iraq&quot;
<br>
and &quot;war&quot; turned up more than 54,000 links, with articles from
<br>
Australian, British and Saudi Arabian news outlets topping the list.
