Forwarding the private reply of Tom Van Flandern - twc:
<br>
<p>*****
<br>
Terry,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here is my response to Ron Ebert's latest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: I replied to what was forwarded by Terry to the Skeptic list.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You seemed to imply that, if four points selected from the
<br>
bottom 2/3 of the list were questionable, the remaining 26 (unseen by
<br>
you) points probably are questionable too. Do you agree, then, that
<br>
would be an invalid generalization?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: The claims have to stand or fall on their own merits, regardless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the person making the claims. But by showing you have already made
</em><br>
<em>&gt;patently false claims about artificial structures on Mars, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrates that your credibility is so low that anything you say has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be independently verified before anyone can believe it.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Raising the level of your protest to a shrill &quot;patently false&quot;,
<br>
even if you added a declaration that the Mars hypothesis contradicts the
<br>
Word of God in the Bible, does nothing to make your &quot;discrediting by
<br>
association&quot; argument scientifically valid -- here or ever.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you wished to show that the messenger (me) is non-credible,
<br>
you would first have to show that some other claim brought by the
<br>
messenger was, in fact, false; then show that the messenger should have
<br>
known better so that the credibility fault is the messenger's. You have
<br>
done neither in connection with the Mars hypothesis. You are simply
<br>
pulling a modern-day &quot;Joe McCarthy&quot; -- who loved to discredit even Nobel
<br>
Laureates in the 1950s by suggesting communist ties or thinking. Read
<br>
the chapter on &quot;Scientific Method&quot; in my book, &quot;Dark Matter, Missing
<br>
Planets and New Comets&quot; (North Atlantic Books, 1993; 2nd edition 1999).
<br>
Skeptics are supposed to be skilled in critical thinking. Yours needs
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the points I made a decade ago, long before evidence for
<br>
artifacts existed, was that the possibility of artifacts on other
<br>
planets is not known to be of low probability, but rather of unknown
<br>
probability, which is a very different matter. For all we know, the
<br>
whole Galaxy has already been explored and there are artifacts on every
<br>
suitable terrestrial planet in it, in which case the probability of our
<br>
finding artifacts on Mars would be close to 100%.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If one is going to be a good skeptic, one must learn to
<br>
recognize the difference between frivolous and well-founded challenges
<br>
to accepted ideas. A skeptic is one who says &quot;show me&quot; and waits to see
<br>
the evidence, not someone who says &quot;don't bother&quot; because he/she already
<br>
knows the answers. In the above, you make no mention of the merits of
<br>
the case for the artificiality hypothesis. You imply that the case
<br>
merits are irrelevant because you already know the answer. That is just
<br>
as invalid scientific reasoning as was implying that the Mars issue has
<br>
bearing on the credibility of my criticisms of the Big Bang.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: The resolution of the problem of the matter-antimatter asymmetry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is to be found in one of these auxiliary theories, not the BB. There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;no mechanism outlined in the BB that addresses the point. For that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reason it is a false and deceptive claim that this asymmetry falsifies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the BB.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is false and deceptive is your changing my list of &quot;The top
<br>
30 *problems* for the Big Bang&quot; into a claim that each point on the list
<br>
is supposed to falsify the BB. That is an invalid &quot;strawman&quot; argument --
<br>
creating a dummy target and beating the stuffing out of it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The matter/antimatter asymmetry remains a real problem for BB,
<br>
and also awaits yet another ad hoc helper hypothesis to save the model.
<br>
Now that we know that even the expansion of the universe is in doubt
<br>
because redshift does not necessarily require velocity as an explanation
<br>
[*], and that better explanations exist for the black body microwave
<br>
radiation than a BB fireball remnant [**], the BB that remains is
<br>
nothing but a collection of flexible auxiliary hypotheses, with no
<br>
kernel to hold them together.
<br>
<p>* [&quot;Did the universe have a beginning?&quot;, MRB 3, 25-35 (1994); Apeiron 2,
<br>
20-24 (1995); &quot;Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets&quot;, North
<br>
Atlantic Books (1999);
<br>
<a href="http://metaresearch.org/cosmology/DidTheUniverseHaveABeginning.asp">http://metaresearch.org/cosmology/DidTheUniverseHaveABeginning.asp</a>]
<br>
<p>** [&quot;New COBE results and the big bang 'fireball'&quot;, MRB 1, 17-21 (1992);
<br>
&quot;Is the microwave radiation really from the big bang 'fireball'?&quot;,
<br>
Reflector XLV, 4 (1993); &quot;Dark Matter, Missing Planets and New Comets&quot;,
<br>
North Atlantic Books (1999).]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: The BB can be falsified on its specific mechanisms and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;predictions. For example, there is a period in time early in the history
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the universe where the temperature range that is coupled with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expansion due to the BB allows for the formation of the hydrogen, helium
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and their isotopes that we see in the universe today. Their ratios to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one another are predicted by the calculations done for this nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;synthesis era. These predicted ratios have been verified by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;observations. Had they not been, the BB would have been falsified.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, each prediction/observation pair initially failed, and
<br>
had to be adjusted by one of those &quot;auxiliary hypotheses&quot;. If a failure
<br>
of one of them really falsified the BB, then it now stands falsified.
<br>
One of the better cases for that at the moment is the B/Be ratio
<br>
[Science 290, 1257 (2000)]. But no BB proponent doubts that another
<br>
auxiliary hypothesis will eventually come to the rescue for that problem
<br>
too. The &quot;dark energy&quot; auxiliary hypothesis, which adds energy wherever
<br>
needed in whatever quantities are needed to keep the BB consistent with
<br>
observations, shows that &quot;falsification&quot; is no longer a part of the BB
<br>
proponents' lexicon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: The quantum fluctuations that provide the background for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Casimir effect cancel out in normal local conditions and provide zero
</em><br>
<em>&gt;net energy. For this reason there is no violation of the first law
</em><br>
<em>&gt;locally.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you propose that, in the locale where new space is created,
<br>
no new zero-point energy is created with the new space? Then the energy
<br>
already there must be shared and is becoming ever more diluted. That
<br>
would defeat the accelerating expansion attributed to the &quot;dark energy&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: [Astrophys.J. 393, 59-67 (1992)] It's an old trick of cranks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to use obsolete data to support their claims.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. Now you include name-calling in your repertoire.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no question that the original study and its later
<br>
confirmation were statistically significant. So until the new study
<br>
shows that it can replicate the old studies, and can then explain why it
<br>
obtained a different result, the conflict will remain unexplained.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: [Guthrie &amp; Napier, Mon.Not.Roy.Astr.Soc. 12/1 issue (1991)];
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Astron.J. 121, 21-30 (2001)] Invalid reference. The volume, page number
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and year don't give any match for this journal in the library database,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and physically checking the journal shows this is an invalid match.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't have the first citation handy, but can write to Bill
<br>
Napier to verify it if necessary. It certainly provides enough
<br>
information to locate the paper in a technical library. The second
<br>
reference is in my hand as I write this, and is correct as to journal,
<br>
volume, page numbers, and year. So your claim that you physically
<br>
checked the journal is shown to be a bluff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: [Astron.&amp;Astrophys. 343, 697-704 (1999)] is a paper about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discrete states of galactic *rotation curves*, NOT radial redshifts.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is what it was intended to show. I referred to *other*
<br>
quantized properties of galaxies in addition to redshift.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: This [set of four references] is a sterling example of why your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;credibility is zero and you are not to be believed without independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;verification.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the credibility of one of us has indeed suffered in this
<br>
exchange. But I'm not the one sweating. :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [tvf]: But why neglect to cite the latest publication on this matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which (unlike the two web sites) is peer-reviewed?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: The web sites are written for general public use by mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physicists who have their own numerous publications in peer reviewed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;journals and who are generally highly respected by their peers. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are reference citations to papers in peer reviewed academic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;journals.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I show my peer-reviewed papers in peer-reviewed academic journals
<br>
[<a href="http://metaresearch.org/home/about%20meta%20research/resume.asp">http://metaresearch.org/home/about%20meta%20research/resume.asp</a>] and
<br>
raise you another 50. :-) Ah, yes: the appeal to authority -- another
<br>
hallmark of invalid reasoning in science.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [tvf]: See [&quot;Experimental Repeal of the Speed Limit for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gravitational, Electrodynamic, and Quantum Field Interactions&quot;, T. Van
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Flandern and J.P. Vigier, Found.Phys. 32(#7), 1031-1068 (2002)].
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: I guess that's supposed to be Foundational Physics. If so, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Science Frontiers it is not an academic journal and the University of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;California library doesn't carry it.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it is &quot;Foundations of Physics&quot;, a major mainstream academic
<br>
physics journal (current editor at Univ. of Colorado). It is revealing
<br>
that you didn't know that, yet considered yourself qualified to comment
<br>
on the relative merits of the academic dispute itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whatever reviewers you are referring to, it is highly likely that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are not mathematical physicists or general relativists with positions at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;academic institutions in those fields. If one crank peer reviews another
</em><br>
<em>&gt;crank, it means nothing.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also revealing that you did not recognize my co-author's
<br>
name -- Jean-Pierre Vigier at Univ. of Paris. He is a celebrated senior
<br>
physicist in whose honor three international symposia have been held.
<br>
Among other positions, he is currently an editor for Physics Letters A,
<br>
another mainstream academic physics journal. And the editor at
<br>
Foundations of Physics would be mightily insulted that you think he was
<br>
incompetent to choose appropriate referees for a controversial paper, or
<br>
to judge the discussion that went on with mathematical physicists for
<br>
the better part of a year before final approval.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But all you really need to do is read the paper. It answers
<br>
every objection raised during the last decade, including the ones at the
<br>
web sites you mentioned, to the satisfaction of neutral parties. No
<br>
rebuttal has been forthcoming (unlike the case following my earlier 1998
<br>
paper, which was followed by some published objections in the form of
<br>
technical comments). This time, the critics appear to have been muted.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately for your position, based as it is on showing that
<br>
I am not a credible source, I am a career astronomer/physicist with
<br>
strong credentials who has found good cause late in my career to become
<br>
critical of certain mainstream models. As long as the criticisms are
<br>
constructive and credible, this process is a normal part of the
<br>
scientific evolution that assures that bad models eventually get weeded
<br>
out. Time will eventually tell which, if any, of these challenges have
<br>
merit. But your assumption that they are unworthy apparently arises from
<br>
reading sources with axes to grind, to judge by the web sites you
<br>
listed. Most scientists appreciate the role of challenges, whether they
<br>
are right or wrong on any particular issue.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [re]: You haven't published in any mainstream physics journal, let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alone a prestigious one, on this subject. I understand you are respected
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a celestial mechanic who is able to accurately work out comet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asteroidal and planetary orbits, but your understanding of relativity
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and quantum mechanics is infantile and you have no hope of getting your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;claims on them published in an academic physics journal.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gee, any return shot I take would be too easy, given that you
<br>
derailed from reality several paragraphs back. But on the specifics, you
<br>
will apparently be surprised to learn that relativity is a part of
<br>
celestial mechanics.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW, since you represent yourself as someone qualified to judge
<br>
the merits of my research, what exactly are *your* qualifications? In
<br>
the scientific arena, that is? I've already seen a sample of your
<br>
oratorical skills. :-) -|Tom|-
