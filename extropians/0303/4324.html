<em>&gt; &gt; The policy adopted [in Iraq after the war] will tell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; us if it has become the settled policy to pursue a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; form of liberal imperialism.  However... influential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; figures both [in the U.S. and U.K.], [wrote documents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before 2000] such as the &quot;New American Century&quot;, put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; put out by a group of neo-cons including people such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as Wolfowitz and Cheney.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Could you describe their vision?
</em><br>
<p>I think their vision is pretty clear, as set out in their various
<br>
publications and in journals such as 'Weekly Standard'. Broadly it is that
<br>
the US (along with other countries in the Anglosphere and a few others)
<br>
represents the values of modernity broadly defined (rationalism, democracy,
<br>
rule of law, market economy et al). These face ideological and physical
<br>
challenges from several sources but above all from the combination of
<br>
militant anti-modernity movements such as Islamic fundamentalism and 'failed
<br>
states' such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen. The solution cannot be a Pat
<br>
Buchanan style withdrawal. Therefore the US has to use the power it has to
<br>
'sort out' problematic areas of the world and in some sense has the
<br>
responsibility to do so, given the values it espouses and the position it
<br>
finds itself in. The underlying belief is that the us has the opportunity
<br>
and duty almost to realise the Enlightenment project of a global
<br>
civilisation. There is one division among folks who think this way. The
<br>
neo-con exponents of this view differ from their New Democrat equivalents in
<br>
thinking the US can do this unilaterally, rather than through international
<br>
institutions such as the UN. It's Teddy Roosevelt versus Woodrow Wilson
<br>
basically. I think myself that after 9/11 the thinking has gone something
<br>
like this. &quot;These bastards are after us because they are opposed to our
<br>
basic principles. The existence of many failed states and the generally
<br>
screwed up nature of the Middle East gives them a steady supply of recruits
<br>
and the chance of getting their hands on some really nasty stuff. We can't
<br>
depend on corrupt clients to do the work for us - they are part of the
<br>
problem anyway. So we have to intervene directly in the ME to lance this
<br>
boil and that requires a permanent base in the shape of a country we can
<br>
reshape as an exemplar. We also can't trust the Saudis any longer. Lets kill
<br>
two birds with one stone and knock off Saddam and use Iraq in this way. We
<br>
also have to set an example so that no other state even thinks about
<br>
developing WMD, much less supplying them to the bad guys, that requires a
<br>
doctrine of preemptive intervention. We can use Iraq as the test case. The
<br>
Middle East and militant Islam are the major problem for our values so if we
<br>
scotch them the main danger is removed&quot;

<em>&gt; &gt; I confess to not having a clue as to what you are talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about when you use the term &quot;liberal imperialism.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me too.  Would that be different from, say, 20th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British administration of India?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>See my reply to Ron for details. No, British administration in India after
<br>
about 1900 (or earlier in the 1840s and 1850s) is a classic example of
<br>
liberal imperialism. See also Lugard in Nigeria, Lyautey in Morrocco.
