</em><br>
<p>What are recommendations for the best way to spread
<br>
transhuman memes to the more resistant population,
<br>
which also seems to be in the vast majority?
<br>
<p>As a younger member, and still in the process of my
<br>
education, I've been doing my mild part to the cause
<br>
by presenting in my casual day-to-day conversations a
<br>
pro-technology view by sharing possible scenarios from
<br>
novels like Neal Stephenson's, loaning out my copy of
<br>
Physics of Immortality (I've gotten atleast 3 people
<br>
to actively get into it...it's a start anyway),
<br>
sometimes quoting some of the more optimistic ideas I
<br>
see on this list.  Supporting the idea of life
<br>
extention sometimes.  Etc...
<br>
<p>The reactions though are dissapointing at best.  Most
<br>
people tend to think I'm just being silly and joke
<br>
that &quot;they'll go down on record as saying that I'm
<br>
crazy&quot;.  Some extreme cases get caught up in some
<br>
detail that they find morally repulsive.  I just had a
<br>
rather educated professor say, &quot;because of Saddam,
<br>
that's why we need to ban cloning right away, imagine
<br>
the horror if there were 20 of him around&quot;, and I
<br>
asked: yes, she was serious.  Some people agree, but I
<br>
see a trend that they also happen to be
<br>
semi-introverted techies already, and prone to memes
<br>
similar to transhumanism. 
<br>
<p>Right now it's the worst since because of political
<br>
tensions resounding through every walk of life, people
<br>
are stuck into quasi-religious states over
<br>
conservatism/liberalism and if ANY of the suggested
<br>
things challenges their predisposed notions, they get
<br>
hostile.
<br>
<p>Now I know a lot of people on this list have probably
<br>
had successes dealing with the
<br>
professional/intelligensia, but since we definetely
<br>
need as least some of the working class, the middlemen
<br>
of society (I'm not being insulting, I'm one of them),
<br>
to come around I'd like to know if anyone has had much
<br>
success intriguing people on transhuman memes.  Or if
<br>
anyone just has suggestions on things to say, ways to
<br>
approach this.
<br>
<p>thanks,
<br>
<p>Cory
