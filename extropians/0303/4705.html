You mention <a href="http://www.hf.caltech.edu/hf/b3/scenarios/">http://www.hf.caltech.edu/hf/b3/scenarios/</a>, and I think it        
<br>
is a good example of what we have to do. If you examine the scenarios it      
<br>
is very obvious (to us) that they totally ignore the possibilities so         
<br>
dear to us. Instead these scenarios are variants of the standard futures      
<br>
people usually think of (you will find variants of these scenarios again      
<br>
and again in the future studies literature) - people are very much            
<br>
trapped in a standard narrative of what the possibilities are (things go      
<br>
on as usual, we revert to barbarism or we end up with a world state)          
<br>
<p><p>Actually, if I was constructing the most likely scenarios for the next 30-50
<br>
years (my projectable future window) mine would probably be like theirs and
<br>
ignore nanplague, nano-Santaclause, friendly AI, unfriendly AI. Or at least
<br>
encapsulate all of those scenarios into one &quot;paradigm shifting technological
<br>
change&quot; scenario.
<br>
<p>When the paradigm-shifted one takes place, all bets are off. No matter what
<br>
you have planned, you're going to have to revise your plans at a frantic
<br>
pace to keep up with the data coming in. The best way to prepare for these
<br>
eventualities is just to be prepared for the general case-- put lots of money
<br>
into R&amp;D, an informed populace, a stable geopolitical situation, as few
<br>
centers of concentrated authority as possible (to minimize the possibility of
<br>
abuse and cooptation).
<br>
<p>I think one of their scenarios probably will happen first. If a crucial
<br>
technological threshold is passed soon enough, they will break out into one
<br>
of our scenarios. If we miss the boat, the world stays mired in one of their
<br>
scenarios until humanity dies by stagnation or starvation.
