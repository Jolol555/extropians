Hey Eliezer! Is this an IRAQ thread? I can't tell.
<br>
<p>Ahem. Following on from my first post to this thread:
<br>
<p>One way of casting what seems to me to be the crucial question is &quot;Can 
<br>
_Islam_ tolerate /'the separation of Church and State'/?&quot;
<br>
<p>Sayyid Qutb was a modern-day, madrassa-and-college-educated Muslim scholar 
<br>
who was hanged (/martyred) in Egypt in 1966. His influence has grown since.
<br>
<p>His answer to that question was, based on my reading of secondary sources, 
<br>
a resounding &quot;NO.&quot; The &quot;Render unto Caesar what is Caesar's, and render 
<br>
unto God what is God's&quot; of the Christian New Testament was in his view the 
<br>
core error of Western Civilization and the cause of all that he found wrong 
<br>
with it--apart from a huge streak of Zionism-related perfidy, that is.
<br>
<p>His masterwork is said to be a huge text called &quot;In the Shadow of the 
<br>
Quran&quot;--written in prison on smuggled paper, currently in translation to 
<br>
English as &quot;fifteen fat volumes&quot;. I have not read them, but I hope to 
<br>
browse them someday soon.
<br>
<p>This book has been referred to, by some, as &quot;Das Kapital for Islamicists&quot;. 
<br>
But I am told that does not do it justice--it is sweeping, lyrical and 
<br>
embodies deep currents of compassion for the disaffected. As long as they 
<br>
submit to Allah.
<br>
<p>So, to borrow from William F. Buckley and V. I. Lenin:
<br>
<p>&quot;The question then becooooomes: 'What is to be done?'&quot;
<br>
<p>MMB
