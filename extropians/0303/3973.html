<em>&gt; I mean, didn't the hard-nosed politicians from their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries tell them what was going to happen?
</em><br>
<p>Rules of memetics: if a meme is being promoted by a
<br>
faction one sees as The Enemy, one is likely to
<br>
invent or adapt memes whose primary purpose is to
<br>
counter those, in service to the meta-meme, &quot;We Are
<br>
Not The Enemy&quot; - which necessarily implies existence
<br>
of and some definition for The Enemy.  In this case,
<br>
quite a number of the people involved were doing this
<br>
to spite said hard-nosed politicians, completely
<br>
ignoring their wisdom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm now starting to wonder if the culture is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of the problem.
</em><br>
<p>It is, for certain definitions of &quot;culture&quot;.  Of
<br>
course, that can be viewed as a circular argument,
<br>
because one can just define &quot;culture&quot; to include
<br>
whatever happens to be the worst part of the problem.
<br>
But this does apply to certain parts of the definition
<br>
that many take for granted - like &quot;anti-Western&quot;,
<br>
which often means pro-corruption (or at least pro- the
<br>
practices which encourage corruption, like valuing the
<br>
way things have been done in the past as intrinsically
<br>
more important than the way most people today wish to
<br>
do things, whether or not corruption is the intended
<br>
end result) among other things.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; southeast Asia, and also throughout Latin America, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percent of people form cliques that totally dominate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economies---ethnically dominant minorities.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Southeast
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Asia, it's the Chinese, and they're resented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Latin America, it's the people with white skins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run not only the economies, but have all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power as well.  What I would dearly love to know: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these economically dominant minorities written the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in such a way as to help keep them in control, i.e.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deny equal protection?
</em><br>
<p>In the worst cases, yes.  In other cases, they don't
<br>
have to (or care to) write it into law, so long as
<br>
what's enforced has the same effect.  For example, in
<br>
China, technically just anyone can run for certain
<br>
offices, but in practice, anyone too far from the
<br>
party line will run into difficulty getting official
<br>
support (for instance, not being able to get on the
<br>
government-published ballot if you're too critical of
<br>
the government).  I claim this is a slightly better
<br>
case since government officials whose hearts change on
<br>
the matter can do the right thing, without having to
<br>
go through the formality of having the law changed
<br>
(which can be difficult, even perilous, if the
<br>
lawmakers' hearts still remain set against change).
