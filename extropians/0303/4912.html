<p><p><em>  &gt;  the web mostly consists of drivel, low quality porn,
</em><br>
<em>  &gt; and interesting content is either not available at all or locked  up.
</em><br>
<p>Not entirely true, I don't think Eliezer would mind me resending a article
<br>
he sent to the list a few months ago.
<br>
======================
<br>
Lately my car has been suffering from a few problems.  It began when the
<br>
engine would sometimes crank for a while before starting.  Then, when
<br>
idling at a stoplight, sometimes the engine would begin sputtering or
<br>
knocking or coughing or something - I don't know the technical name for
<br>
this particular kind of funny noise - causing the entire car to rock.
<br>
Then the idling problem at stoplights got bad enough that the entire car
<br>
would just stall, requiring me to, in a hurry, switch the car off and
<br>
start it up again.
<br>
<p>I know absolutely nothing about cars.  The only reason I know it's called
<br>
&quot;cranking&quot; rather than &quot;starting your car&quot; is because I googled on my
<br>
problem and managed to find the right keywords from reading someone else's
<br>
description.
<br>
<p>So I take my car in to a mechanic.  He looks over the car for 30 minutes.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Can't quite find what's wrong.  He thinks it might be the idle speed
<br>
regulator computer or the O2 sensor.  I don't know how expensive these
<br>
parts are, or where they need to be ordered from, but I fear the worst.
<br>
<p>So I do what any Child of the Internet would do in this situation.  I say:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Check the fuel filter.&quot;
<br>
<p>The mechanic comes back.  The fuel filter is almost completely blocked.
<br>
Swap in a new fuel filter, drive away.
<br>
<p>Why?  Because someone else who owned a 1995 Ford Escort had an identical
<br>
problem, which turned out to be the fault of the fuel filter, and posted
<br>
about it to Usenet, which I searched using, you guessed it, Google News,
<br>
before taking my car in.
<br>
<p>I can fix problems I don't understand.  There are no words to convey the
<br>
feeling of omnipotence this generates.  The combined knowledge of the
<br>
entire human species is at my beck and call.  It doesn't matter whether I
<br>
understand cars.  It's enough that someone somewhere does.  That knowledge
<br>
is my knowledge for I am of the Children of the Internet.  You can keep
<br>
the Force, thank you; the Google is my ally and it has the Force beat cold
<br>
solid.  The mechanic has years of training and years of experience.  I
<br>
know nothing about cars and the workings of the engine are a complete
<br>
mystery to me; for all I know the fuel filter passes food pellets to
<br>
hamsters running on wheels.  It doesn't matter.  Nothing matters except
<br>
that I have Google.  I am the racial memory of the human species and no
<br>
isolate can compete against that.  Somewhere in the back of my mind is the
<br>
realization that I had to drive to an auto shop to actually carry out the
<br>
repair.  I am helpless in the face of mechanical things and wouldn't dare
<br>
try to remove or replace a fuel filter if I somehow managed to find it
<br>
inside the engine.  I try to focus on this thought and it doesn't make the
<br>
high go away.  I am the Web.  I am the groupmind.  Resistance is futile
<br>
for we are Eliezer of Google.
<br>
<p>Has anyone else begun to get the feeling that, wherever you go, you are
<br>
there to represent the Net groupmind?  I don't have a wireless wearable so
<br>
it's not really true, yet, but on this occasion the sensation was quite
<br>
strong.
