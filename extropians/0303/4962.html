Have you *EVER* seen a complete list of the laws?  I haven't.  I do know 
<br>
that the DMCA by itself was over 2000 pages long.  (Or perhaps that was 
<br>
the UCTIA 2b [renamed].).  I've seen a library of the texts of important 
<br>
contract laws of the state of California.  Library is the word.  And 
<br>
everytime a voters pamplet comes out, I try to figure out what the 
<br>
things they want to pass really mean.  I estimate my reading time for 
<br>
law as about an hour per page.  (That's more than I actually invest, but 
<br>
I don't always end up understanding what I've read.)
<br>
<p>And you say I should be aware of all of these laws!  Not only would I 
<br>
not have time to do anything else, I wouldn't have time to eat or sleep, 
<br>
either.  You might assert that &quot;well, you only need to read the 
<br>
important laws&quot;, but those aren't the only felonies.  Conspiracy to 
<br>
comit a misdeameanor, e.g., is a felony.  So if you are planning to do 
<br>
something that violates any minor law (well, not ordinances... I think 
<br>
that's a separate category), then you are comitting a felony, and so 
<br>
this restriction referred to comes into play.
<br>
<p>Now normally I would agree that these laws are not enforced.  But they 
<br>
are on the books, and they have been enforced when the powers that be 
<br>
wanted to *get* someone.  A valid defense is random enforcement, but 
<br>
that's a tough argument, and an expensive argument, and if they are 
<br>
holding you without a lawyer (as per recent laws), then you can't even 
<br>
make it.  Even when the defense is allowed, and is successful, the 
<br>
objective of &quot;getting that person away from here&quot; is normally achieved, 
<br>
and the costs of defending themselves is generally an adequate deterrent 
<br>
against repetition.  Unless you are VERY wealthy, in which case they 
<br>
wouldn't bother you anyway.  These laws are directed at letting the 
<br>
government cut off whatever behavior, however legal, it chooses to.  
<br>
Like &quot;peacably assembling to petition the government for redress of 
<br>
wrongs&quot; (I probably garbled the quote, but not the essential meaning).
