<br>
Wednesday for the start of a three-day summit, hosted by TIME, to sip

<br>
such a powerhouse crowd pondering so cosmic a theme, there were
<br>
fireworks from the outset as participants debated stem cell research,
<br>
discussed the upswing in anti-evolutionary fervor, examined the promise
<br>
of nanotechnology in medicine and considered whether anyone would ever

<p>Time - Though nothing in the laws of physics rules out quantum

the teetering quantum states to collapse. Given such obstacles, quantum

Stupidity should be cured, says DNA discoverer

<br>
<p>New Scientist - Fifty years to the day from the discovery of the
<br>
structure of DNA, one of its co-discoverers has caused a storm by
<br>
suggesting that stupidity is a genetic disease that should be cured. On
<br>
28 February 1953 biologists James Watson and Francis Crick discovered
<br>
the structure of DNA - the chemical code for all life. The breakthrough
<br>
revealed how genetic information is passed from one generation to the
<br>
next and revolutionised biology and medicine. But in a documentary
<br>
series to be screened in the UK on Channel 4, Watson says that low
<br>
intelligence is an inherited disorder and that molecular biologists have
<br>
a duty to devise gene therapies or screening tests to tackle stupidity.
