Aaah, come on Mike, you can do harder and better than that. But this is all
<br>
I wanted to achieve: show you and the rest of your patriot friends, that you
<br>
are annoyed by a virtual PC (puke container) while I am annoyed by the blood
<br>
in the streets caused by your fine Christian fundamentalist leader who
<br>
encourages killing civilians.

<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bring your personal throw up to the local PC!

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; From today on everybody who feels like he has to puke when watching

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Fuehrer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; George Troubleyou Bush addressing the US army, or US /UK war criminals

<em>&gt; It has been evident for some time now that you have very strong feelings,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mr. Mania. And that's fine; many of us do. Permit me to express some of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mine. If you can be militant for pacifism, I think I can and must militate
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; for--whatever my view is, if it can be fairly labeled. So here goes. Sorry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the long letter, I didn't have time to write a short one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This latest passionate post of yours trivializes the matters at hand, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests to me that you are perhaps feeling rather powerless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Samantha and others have noted on this list, it is quite possible that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world stands on the threshold of WW IV (or III, take your pick), or
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; N+1th Crusade, or something just as full of pain and peril, but harder to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; label.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you really, *really* find puking the most effective response?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;flame=HIGH&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that's the best you can offer, I'd much prefer that you (personally)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puke all over yourself and then simmer in it as you choke. Which is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you seem to be doing with this post. Good show! Feels good to puuuuuke,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't it--makes you HOLY, right? Holier than, well, just about anybody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're sure is a MONSTER, right? Keep it up, and don't mind the airway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Puking for change is FUN and PRODUCTIVE. Plus, in email, nobody has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smell it, or administer CPR. YOU BETCHA, you're REALLY going to show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Troubleyou a thing or two.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;flame=OFF&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe you actually have diagnosable mania. I have come close to wondering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about myself once or twice; in those cases I sometimes felt righteous to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point of (on later reflection) absurdity. It's part of the pattern.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;flame=MEDIUM&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Get a clue. Until you're willing to set yourself on fire on the steps of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Capitol building, your impotent pointless posturing engenders my pity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and contempt, even while I share some of your fears.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll repeat that: ...EVEN WHILE I SHARE SOME OF YOUR FEARS, YOU ENGENDER
</em><br>
MY
<br>
<em>&gt; PITY AND CONTEMPT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hate reinstituting killfiles, I really do. But a &quot;SELF-INDULGENT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SANCTIMONIOUS ASSHOLE&quot; email hotkey is substantially less civil, wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you agree? Yes, announcing a PLONK is always, in large part, a self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indulgent thing. I wish I could bring myself to just silently killfile
</em><br>
you--
<br>
<em>&gt; but the fact is that my sentiments don't fit into your compartments and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; felt/thought that the list deserved mine at least as much as yours. And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just like puking, plonkng feeeels gooooooood. So I'm not claiming I'm that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much better than you, no siree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I hope you actually get a grip someday (/again); these are hard times. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the meantime, accept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My heartiest warm puke-soaked wishes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
