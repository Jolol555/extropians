<p>Maybe it is because there is no &quot;pure&quot; libertarian position on this
<br>
war. I can see libertarians reach very different conclusions on whether 
<br>
this is initiation of force or not, and these conclusions will largely 
<br>
be based on issues external to libertarian ideology (like how much you 
<br>
trust the evidence given by different groups, interpretations of 
<br>
international law etc).
<br>
<p><p>This reminds me of another interesting issue: warfare in a world where
<br>
actual libertarian areas exist. In a sf setting I participated writing
<br>
in, one of the major space wars was complicated by the fact that one of
<br>
the participants was a libertarian alliance where individual members (be
<br>
they nations, worlds, companies or individuals) decided for themselves
<br>
whether to participate, how much and on what side; as long as they did
<br>
not hit any other member of the alliance they were free to side with
<br>
whoever they wanted. So it was never an issue of whether the alliance
<br>
was at war or not, but rather what percentage of it and in what
<br>
direction. Enemies found that they better be careful about who they
<br>
attacked, since they might attack a previously non-participating group
<br>
and now invoke its PPLs, mutual defense pacts and insurance company. At
<br>
least one system was invaded by a company-leased fleet as restitution
<br>
for an insurance claim.
<br>
<p>The current paradigms of nation-nation warfare are not even working well
<br>
these days, let alone when dealing with nation-network warfare. Just
<br>
imagine the chaos when we get network-network warfare.
