<p>Interesting. Seems to be a neat trick.
<br>
<p>The basic problem isn't that the allocation is unfair, but that 
<br>
political pressures can introduce more stuff as &quot;public goods&quot;. 
<br>
Are puppet theaters public goods taxpayers should fund? At 
<br>
least in Sweden they are :-) So this means the government can 
<br>
introduce a nearly arbitrary number of new goods to vote about. 
<br>
<p>It is a bit like direct democracy: we all may vote, but who
<br>
defines what we are allowed to vote about? Maybe there should
<br>
be some kind of voting process to add and remote public goods. 
<br>
But if I can get a minimal tax on all of you to end up favoring
<br>
my group, then I'm better off and you don't feel much worse off
<br>
- until everybody does it, which means the money ends up in the
<br>
pockets of those who get to represent the biggest groups.
<br>
<p>And what would the default M be? If a new dial appears on all
<br>
our taxameters set to M_gov, then I will find that lowering my
<br>
dial will cost me, so I won't lower my dial very much even if I
<br>
think the new good is useless. The same goes for everybody
<br>
else, which means that the inertia in the system will lead to
<br>
people voting for an allocation of nearly M_gov for something
<br>
none might actually want. So maybe a better rule would be that
<br>
any new public good should start out with an allocation of zero
<br>
(after all, that was the state before the new dial anyway), but
<br>
now we get the opposite effect: it is hard to raise the
<br>
allocation to the level people might want, even if we all want
<br>
it. 
<br>
<p>These are likely manageable problems given the basic system. 
<br>
Over time things would likely stabilize. People would try to 
<br>
convince each other to change their dials in concert. Compared 
<br>
to the current system it seems quite reasonable.
<br>
<p>Maybe a more serious issue is how it would affect change in the 
<br>
economy. This is a very neoclassic model. But what about 
<br>
entrepreneurs and dynamic destruction?
