<em>&gt; &gt;American imperialism, western islam-hatred,

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been wondering how Jews in the Nazi camps would

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Allied bombers and artillery unintentionally killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few hundred of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually happened.) 
</em><br>
<p>For them to have an idea who bombed them, the captors
<br>
would have shown some sign, running in a panic,
<br>
setting up a defense, etc...maybe it would have even
<br>
been a good thing to have the camps bombed in their
<br>
perspective resulting in SOME deaths as opposed to all
<br>
deaths, or best case scenario, nailing the guards
<br>
while they were in the confines of a semi-bomb proof
<br>
gas chamber (presuming they could escape afterwards)? 
<br>
My intial reaction is they wouldn't remember any
<br>
bitterness against the allies given what they were
<br>
exposed to.  Maybe I'm wrong, but certainly I don't
<br>
muse about this much (not my being wrong, but how they
<br>
would have reacted).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect they'd have regarded it as the tragic but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mysterious will of God,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and been grateful for their escape from Hitler and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his lunatics. The Iraqis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparently aren't reacting that way *at all*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probably they're all paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actors sworn to personal Hussein service.
</em><br>
<p>Does Iraq really have (errr, did...have) that much
<br>
money?  Certainly not all have been subjected to the 
<br>
brutalities?  Wasn't the gassing directed at the
<br>
Kurds?  Sure the laws are pretty awful, they hold no
<br>
real regard for women's rights, but nothing unusual
<br>
from a historical standpoint comparing to many
<br>
countries that defended their leaders.  I'd imagine
<br>
there's physical limits to how brutal a dictator can
<br>
be anyway (they can't watch everyone, they have to be
<br>
generous enough to some for them to enforce their
<br>
ways, etc).  And, just like some claim, &quot;if you don't
<br>
break the laws, you have nothing to worry about&quot; ,add
<br>
the clause &quot;...and you're race/gender/family, etc
<br>
aren't previously hated, nor have you developed
<br>
enemies in power&quot; and you probably have the same
<br>
situation in mostly any of the worst of countries. 
<br>
The truly psychotic dictators probably don't last
<br>
(we'll watch Turkmenistan) nearly as long as vile
<br>
(I've found from accidental typing, that this anagram
<br>
of the word evil, can be substituted for it in almost
<br>
all cases), calculating ones.
