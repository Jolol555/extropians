<p>Every single witness (that spoke on anything I could tell about) lied 
<br>
under oath.  Dean was not worse than the others.  My belief as I 
<br>
observed the proceedings was they every one of them was trying to 
<br>
contain the damage.  (And, of course, not be blamed themselves for their 
<br>
own crimes.)  Do you think I consider the &quot;born again witness&quot; (Colson 
<br>
wasn't it) any more credible?  If you want to assert that the evidence 
<br>
was hidden, so we can't really be sure, then I will have to agree with 
<br>
you.  But when I look at who was manuvering how to hide it... I make my 
<br>
estimate of which one I believe is lying more.  It was intentional on 
<br>
the part of all parties involved.  There could even have been legitamate 
<br>
reasons.  We can't know.  After the hearing they sealed all the evidence 
<br>
and said that nobody could see it for ?? was it 300 years?  Some 
<br>
rediculously long period of time, anyway.  Long before then all the 
<br>
tapes will have been corroded, the papers will become too brittle to 
<br>
handle, etc.  The real idea was that nobody should ever be able to find 
<br>
out legally on what the decision was really based.
<br>
<p>You've got to trust the government.  They won't give you enough 
<br>
information to do anything else.
