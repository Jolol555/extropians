<p><em>&gt; [Amara] wrote that reporting that one part of the Patriot Act II would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlaw using encryption in the commission of a felony.  That is exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the sort of thing I expect to see struck down in act of becoming law or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be struck down in the courts if it is ever used as the basis of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminal charge.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a rough parallel.  Is it a felony for a person planning a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime to use a scrambler when talking on the phone?  I suspect not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there a law against criminals taking steps to conceal their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversations from police authorities?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that there is such a law.  Another parallel that
<br>
comes to mind is the category of &quot;hate crime&quot;.  Suppose that
<br>
you murder X, which is of course a terrible crime.  Your prison
<br>
sentence will be compounded if it is shown that your *motivation*
<br>
had to do with race.
<br>
<p>I think that that's silly.  Punishment must fit the crime,
<br>
not the motive.
<br>
<p>In the same way, one will not be punished in the Patriot Act II
<br>
for using cryptology, but, in an exactly analogous way, it will
<br>
lengthen one's sentence.  This also seems silly.  It's the *crime*
<br>
that matters.  I too hope that this part is defeated.
<br>
<p>But it's only *silly* IMO.  I get no more excited over it than
<br>
I do &quot;hate crime&quot;, which, though closer, still has a way to go
<br>
before it gets to &quot;thought crime&quot;.
<br>
<p>In another message today, Ron posts
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The [Patriot Act II], if ever enacted as presented to us by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ACLU, is a monstrosity.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I was unable to get Hubert to say exactly why.
<br>
Would you please?  What, specifically, in the ACLU
<br>
paper seems monstrous?  
<br>
<p>Here is my challenge to Hubert which he has so far declined.
<br>
(It also contains an URL to the original ACLU site.)
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0303/4482.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0303/4482.html</a>
<br>
<p>In it I list four items that at first seemed bad to me, but which,
<br>
after looking more carefully, I couldn't actually find very
<br>
objectionable.  (The name of the thread here &quot;My Blind Spot&quot;
<br>
was not chosen carelessly!)
<br>
<p>I realize that this is something the Left should do here, not
<br>
you---but they seem quite reluctant for some reason.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
