Hi Mike - It's Ian again -
<br>
I read some other stuff of yours - particularly about the patients bill of
<br>
rights act &amp; fine print creep - right on! and further, I agree with many of
<br>
your points - but there is certainly no standard libertarian stance on the
<br>
Iraq war. Further, I would fully support regime change - and am not against
<br>
dropping a few bombs to do it - or finding some other way to knock off or
<br>
buy off Saddam - but a unilateral campaign of &quot;shock and awe&quot; is criminal
<br>
and is sure to increase terrorism and conflict with the muslim world - not
<br>
to mention weaken the UN, Nato, US cohesion, the US economy, US civil
<br>
liberties -
<br>
<p>I have heard your argument that Iraq is like 1920s or 30s Germany, and that
<br>
europe is guilty of appeasement - from more than a few pro-war voices.
<br>
<p>To me, this analogy is, I don't really know how to say this without you
<br>
getting out your flame thower, but, please choose the term that is least
<br>
offensive - the argument is: a. simply dishonest propaganda b. propaganda
<br>
intended to remind the French of their debt to us c. a sign of ossified
<br>
brains that are still somehow frozen in pre-cold war days d. wild-eyed nutso
<br>
e. Paranoid
<br>
f. pathetically historically ignorant g. a function of a large group of
<br>
americans whose sole understanding of history comes from the history channel
<br>
and war movies- to me, it is all of these - depending on who is making the
<br>
argument. But when I hear intelligent people, such as yourself, (as well as
<br>
a good friend of mine) make this argument, I am TRULY perplexed. How in the
<br>
hell can you support an analogy that compares the relative economic,
<br>
military and intelligence powers of Iraq vs. Europe, Russia, US &amp; Arab
<br>
countries combined - to 1930s Germany vs. Europe, Russia, US &amp; allied Arab
<br>
countries? Where are Iraq's allies - like Germany's Italy, Spain &amp; Japan?
<br>
Syria? oh no! (yes i know I am neglecting the Russian/Nazi nonaggression
<br>
pact - justifiably but that's another issue) Iraq is militarily and
<br>
economically defeated - destroying it's own weapons, letting UN inspectors
<br>
roam the country, under sanctions, etc. This is not the Nazis taking over
<br>
the sudentenland &amp; merging with austria. Iraq is under our thumb. If the
<br>
argument is that at some point in the future Iraq might develop nukes - A.
<br>
Doubtful  B. Iraq attacking another country would certainly be total suicide
<br>
or Saddam is going to give suitcase nukes to terrorists? Don't you think he
<br>
would get caught even if, which is an extraordinary longshot - he could do
<br>
it? By far the greater danger along these lines is Iran, which does have a
<br>
nuke program, is run by relgious fanatics, etc. The HUGE problem i see with
<br>
&quot;shock &amp; awe&quot; bombing of iraq is that Iran will respond, like N. Korea, by
<br>
stepping up its nuke capability, clamping down on opposition parties &amp;
<br>
reform efforts, and really getting ready for Jihad. If we show Iran that
<br>
Iraq's steps towards disarmament only lead us to invade, Iran will ignore
<br>
the nuclear reg. agencies &amp; proceed full steam with their nuke program. On
<br>
the other hand, Libya was brought around with a few well targeted bombs -
<br>
and is now even talking about compensating the victims of the lockerbie
<br>
bombing. Iraq is far more like Libya that Nazi germany. Pakistan could also
<br>
be taken over by fanatics.
