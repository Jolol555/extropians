<em>&gt;Agree about the handiness factor being absent. Of course, that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very much what paper and ink booksellers are still in the business
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of selling at a premium (at a profit).
</em><br>
<p>Libraries might not be the best way of reading books these days,
<br>
anyway, given the current political climate.
<br>
<p>Since the Feds can now snoop into U.S citizen's reading habits,
<br>
I suggest not to use libraries for your reading material. You might
<br>
want to think twice about bookstore purchases too.

<p>Libraries post Patriot Act warnings
<br>
Santa Cruz branches  tell patrons that FBI may spy on them
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
&quot;The Justice Department says libraries have become a logical target
<br>
of surveillance in light of evidence that some Sept. 11 hijackers
<br>
used library computers to communicate with each other.
<br>
<p>But the signs ordered by the Santa Cruz library board -- a more
<br>
elaborate version of warnings posted in several libraries around the
<br>
nation -- are adding to the heat now being generated by a
<br>
once-obscure provision of the Patriot Act.
<br>
<p>Section 215 of the act allows FBI agents to obtain a warrant from a
<br>
secret federal court for library or bookstore records of anyone
<br>
connected to an investigation of international terrorism or spying.
<br>
<p>Unlike conventional search warrants, there is no need for agents to
<br>
show that the target is suspected of a crime or possesses evidence
<br>
of a crime. As the Santa Cruz signs indicate, the law prohibits
<br>
libraries and bookstores from telling their patrons, or anyone else,
<br>
that the FBI has sought the records.
<br>
<p>The provision was virtually unnoticed when the Patriot Act, a major
<br>
expansion of government search and surveillance authority, was
<br>
passed by Congress six weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But
<br>
in the last year, Section 215 has roused organizations of librarians
<br>
and booksellers into a burst of political activity, and is being
<br>
cited increasingly by critics as an example of the new law's
<br>
intrusiveness. &quot;
