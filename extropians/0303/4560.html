<br>
matter. The collateral damage to the US and to the interests of its citizens 
<br>
has started already.  The United States signed the United Nations Charter and 
<br>
(under the Bush administration) resolution 1441. These are solemn agreements 
<br>
made on very serious matters and any breaches of them and the consequences of 
<br>
any breaches of them by the US (under the Bush administration) will remain on 
<br>
the public record longer than Saddam Hussein or President Bush remain at the 
<br>
head of their respective Nation states.
<br>
<p>Brett,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do take our international treaty obligations seriously but they are 
<br>
not just binding on us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, we are in one of the toughest situations a person or nation 
<br>
can be in.  We are under threat by a person that has shot up one of our ships 
<br>
without provocation, that has attempted to assassinate a past President of 
<br>
ours, that is now threatening us by his conduct.  That is to say 12 years ago 
<br>
he signed a cease fire to give up certain weapons and undergo an inspection 
<br>
process -- he has refused to do so to our satisfaction.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should not have to repeat that.  That I have to, in my opinion, is a 
<br>
sign of bad faith on the part of those of you that are standing in opposition 
<br>
to my country -- you have known all this for long since.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The situation is like the man being threatened by a shotgun:
<br>
-the man threatening us has been known to harm us in the past.  Shall we 
<br>
defend ourselves based on his threat?  You would say &quot;no&quot; the threat is 
<br>
insufficient.
<br>
-the man has a shot gun.  Shall we defend ourselves when he opens the gun to 
<br>
reload?  You would say &quot;no&quot; the threat is insufficient.
<br>
-Should we defend ourselves after the gun is reloaded.  You say &quot;no&quot; the 
<br>
threat is insufficient.
<br>
-Should we defend ourselves when he has shouldered the shotgun?  You say 
<br>
&quot;no&quot;, the theat is not sufficient.
<br>
-Should we defend ourselves after he has shot us?  You say &quot;no&quot;, he has not 
<br>
killed us.
<br>
-Should our friends defend us after we are dead?  You say &quot;no&quot;, we are dead, 
<br>
what good would it be to defend us now?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without doubt there is no time that some one cannot argue against the 
<br>
right to conduct a pre-emptive defense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please understand this.  Sadaam Hussein has gone down the road of 
<br>
threatening us in a manner that limits us to a pre-emptive defense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will not wait until you, or Sadaam, or the UN, or Germany, or 
<br>
France says, &quot;US, now you have permission to defend yourself.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We will decide when the time has come to protect ourselves and we will 
<br>
decide what the best means of defense is.
<br>
Have a good day.
<br>
Ron h.
