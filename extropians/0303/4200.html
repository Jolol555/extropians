<p><em>&gt; I suppose, for symmetry, the French won't be happy unless we give Iraq

</em><br>
<p>No, Germany only started to re-arm, and was a threat after
<br>
Hitler's accession in 1933.  So the French gave peace a
<br>
chance for 6 years, until Germany was stronger than France.
<br>
<p>This is the noble sentiment of parity.  The U.S. has many
<br>
nuclear tipped missiles that could be targeted on Iraq, and
<br>
so why shouldn't the West wait until Iraq and developed
<br>
and smuggled atomic bombs into the West.  Wouldn't that
<br>
be fair?
<br>
<p>The French would just let a bad situation get worse, playing
<br>
for time, hoping for some kind of rapprochement to develop
<br>
or a change in fortune, perhaps.
<br>
<p>I don't get it.  When it was too late, they didn't hesitate.
<br>
As soon as Poland was invaded, they declared war along with
<br>
the UK.  Of course, the stakes were much higher for France
<br>
without a lovely channel to protect them, and they put four
<br>
million men on the line in 1939-40.  Many of those units 
<br>
were very good.  But they had simply waited too long.  As
<br>
always, since the formation of Germany, the Germans had a
<br>
three-to-two numerical advantage, and France could simply
<br>
not stand alone.
<br>
<p>But why didn't they invade Germany in 1936 when Hitler
<br>
seized the Rhineland, and he would have been incredibly
<br>
easy to defeat?  Somehow he knew they wouldn't, and he
<br>
was right.
