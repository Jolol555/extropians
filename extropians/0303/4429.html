</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am going to spend a lot of time repeating that the issue isn't just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Iraq. But to get one Iraq-specific point out of the way...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Of course it is not about Iraq.  It is about the stated policy 
<br>
of being justified to use preemptive strikes wherever we believe 
<br>
we are threatened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; From the standpoint of an armistice with dictated terms (not a peace), a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military action in response to a violation of the terms of the armistice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not preemption. It would be a cleaner matter in old (Treaty of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Westphalia) terms if there had been a tidy declaration of war on both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides, but such seem to have gone out of fashion. I wish I really 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understood why--I have my suspicions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not speaking primarily of Iraq and I don't consider that an 
<br>
instance of any meaningful preemption in any case.  Stupid 
<br>
policy and unjustified use of force yes, but not preemption 
<br>
except for those who still believe Iraq is somehow a creditable 
<br>
threat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not sure. I used to be sure. As I said, non-solution unsatisfactory. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the even more correct term is not pr-emption, it's PREVENTION, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an even bigger red flag to the parts of me that are still wired to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dislike &quot;status crimes&quot;--making things, rather than actions, unlawful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Prevention of war or terrorism by killing all who might every 
<br>
likely be able and desire to attack?  Surely this is not 
<br>
justifiable ever.  There can be no peace if this is considered 
<br>
reasonable.  No one and no country with any serious 
<br>
disagreements with a country having such a policy and the might 
<br>
to enforce it would ever sleep soundly until said country was 
<br>
defanged.  Where is there any moral high ground or justification 
<br>
at all for such?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point being that pre-emption is action taken when an attack is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imminent, and prevention is action taken to make attack impossible. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't like it when, e.g., some busybody want to PREVENT me from doing X 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or Y or Z. But I don't have a track record as bad as Saddam's. 
</em><br>
<p>Make up your mind.  Is this about Iraq or not?  I believe it is 
<br>
far broader.  I would also point out that we ourselves don't 
<br>
have a lily white track record.  The question is whether the 
<br>
initiation of force is justified in international relations.  I 
<br>
do not believe it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Factor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the &quot;who gassed who&quot; jazz, ignore whether or not he got a green 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light to roll over Kuwait--he's still killing something like 36,000 of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his countrymen every year. That's HIM doing it, as a matter of policy,
</em><br>
<p>Maybe so.  But then we and the allies are responsible for even 
<br>
more deaths in Iraq every year.  We admitted as much.  So surely 
<br>
this is not a justification for killing hundreds of thousands 
<br>
more and destroying much of the rest of the infrastructure of 
<br>
the country.  We have supported many leaders who have much, much 
<br>
worse track records.  So this is no justification.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; independent of any effect of sanctions. And I think there's some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indication that if somehow Saddam is &quot;contained&quot; for, say, ten more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years, another 300,000 to 400,000 of his people will be killed by his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And by ours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I am done talking about Saddam in this post.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Good.  I thought you were much earlier, but ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You want everybody to wait until there's a big smoking hole; that's the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only fair way to fight. In the abstract, I do agree with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you--retaliation is much more clear-cut. But did you actually read the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; referenced articles, or are you simply reacting to the parts I (/Dan) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quoted? The notion that some states are much more functionally sovereign 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and more functionally vulnerable) than other is crucial to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusions quoted. I am not sure I disagree sharply. I do agree that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things are a mess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I read it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; And as the scene is becoming clear, in the general case one can create a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big smoking hole without leaving a clear contrail back to the guilty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; party. It truly is only a matter of time before someone manages to pull 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that off. What then? And the crucial thing is that superempowerment can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to a non-state actor deeply damaging a sovereign state. Do we just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grimace and shrug when that happens?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, hey, after all, it's a free world, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It has always been truth that big smoking holes could be created 
<br>
without leaving a contrail back to the guilty party.  But how is 
<br>
that a justification for preemptive strikes on the terroritory 
<br>
of other nations?   How is it a justification for invasions?  A 
<br>
better guarantee of safety as we get more personal power for 
<br>
destruction (arguably it still isn't that easy) is to act as 
<br>
civilly with one another and between countries as possibly.  But 
<br>
this is very much not the policy of the US right now.  So 
<br>
when/if it happens I do not in any way see how we can claim that 
<br>
we are totally blameless.  We have hung the proverbial sword 
<br>
over much of the world now.  Should we be oh so shocked and 
<br>
surpised that some will resent it and act on that resentment? 
<br>
No, this is not a justification for terrorism.  But it is 
<br>
pointing out that the way to reasonably peaceful and free future 
<br>
is not through eliminating all possible threats regardless of 
<br>
how we ourselves act.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I am opposed to human suffering. As one of the quoted parts of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article said, it might very well be that Saddam isn't the droid we're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looking for. 
</em><br>
<p>He absolutely certainly is not &quot;the droid&quot; we claim we are 
<br>
looking for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it also may be that by granting creeps like him the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same standing as leaders of less screwed up countries, we are doing a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; net disservice to humanity. This presupposes that some creeps really are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a lot worse than others--sepecially inasmuch as they might not care who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they empower, or might even delight in the deniability of same. The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue needs to be looked at squarely, independent of the situation with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq qua Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So, we can march into and take over any country we consider to 
<br>
be run by creeps and other wise leaders and peoples should do 
<br>
the same heh?  Wonderful.  The utter rule of might and the 
<br>
prejudicies and fears of the governments.  Doesn't these seem 
<br>
like a buge step toward oblivion to you?
<br>
<p>When it comes to creeps we have empowered and supported some of 
<br>
the worst on earth, including Saddam.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And this is separable from all the things you (I guess) don't like about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; George Bush. It really is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it is separable from all the things the US has done in foreign 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arenas in the past that sucked. It really, REALLY is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>George Bush is irrelevant.  He is simply holding the bag while 
<br>
the US is taking the gloves off on attitudes and actions, 
<br>
especially towards the rights of Americans themselves, that have 
<br>
been cooking and developing for decades.  I wish it was as 
<br>
simple as this one man being a mad dog.  Unfortunately it is 
<br>
much worse than that.
<br>
<p>It is not separate from the things we have done that sucked if 
<br>
much of the anger and likely agression towards us is BECAUSE of 
<br>
those things.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Maybe it _is_ time for &quot;sovereignty lite&quot;. I don't like it much. But I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider the topic to be open for discussion, INDEPENDENT of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presenting situation in/around Iraq, which is why I posted. I suspect 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the Treaty of Westphalia is on borrowed time no matter what happens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to/in Iraq. And I do not consider dicsussion of such unreasonable. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Especially if a paradigm shift really is on the way, for good OR ILL. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am not confident I grok all the ramifications. It doesn't have to imply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utter chaos, though that's a comfortably-hysterical view for some.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So sovereignity is absolute for those with the most guns and 
<br>
lite for everyone else heh?  Or in terms of rights and equality, 
<br>
&quot;some are more equal than others&quot;.  This is a formula for global 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;insecurity and war.  All of our &gt;human goals are likely to be 
<br>
toast for at least a generation if we go down this road. 
<br>
Consider very deeply the consequences of what you propose. 
<br>
Whether there is a paradigm shift is up to us in a country 
<br>
supposedly representing the will of its people.  We cannot 
<br>
simply sit back and allow a dangerous shift.  Not if we care 
<br>
about our lives and future.
