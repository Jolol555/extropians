I'd like to hear the opinion of some of the very bright people on this list, do you think Saddam Hussein is alive? At first I though he was but now I'm not so sure. It has now been one week since a bunker the CIA thought he was in was destroyed and he must know about rumors floating around that he's dead or badly injured, and those rumors can only weaken his regime, so if he's alive and healthy I can't figure out why he doesn't put a stop to them. It should be very easy, just mention on TV some current event on the battlefield or hell just say who won the Academy Award for best supporting actress last Sunday, but all we've heard from Mr. Hussein is generic speeches that could have been taped a month before fighting started, including praise for his army's 51's division that surrendered in the opening hours of the war and no longer exists. Why would he do that?
