<p>World and America watching different wars
<br>
CNN vs. Al Jazeera: Seeing is often believing
<br>
<p>By Danna Harman | Staff writer of The Christian Science Monitor
<br>
<p>[excerpt]
<br>
&quot;In fact, American audiences are seeing and reading about a different
<br>
war than the rest of the world. The news coverage in Europe, the
<br>
Middle East, and Asia, reflects and defines the widening perception
<br>
gap about the motives for this war. Surveys show that an increasing
<br>
number of Americans believe this is a just war, while most of the
<br>
world's Arabs and Muslims see it as a war of aggression. Media
<br>
coverage does not necessarily create these leanings, say analysts,
<br>
but it works to cement them.
<br>
<p>&quot;The difference in coverage between the US and the rest of the world
<br>
helped contribute to the situation that we're in now,'' says Kim
<br>
Spencer, president of WorldLink TV, a US satellite channel devoted
<br>
to airing foreign news. &quot;Americans have been unable to see how
<br>
they're perceived.&quot;
<br>
<p>For example, most Americans, watching CNN, Fox, or the US television
<br>
networks, are not seeing as much coverage of injured Iraqi citizens,
<br>
or being given more than a glimpse of the antiwar protests now
<br>
raging in the Muslim world and beyond.
<br>
<p>In the Middle East, Europe, and parts of Asia, by comparison, the
<br>
rapid progress made by US led troops has been played down. And many
<br>
aspects of the conflict being highlighted in the US - such as the
<br>
large number of Iraqi troops surrendering, the cooperation between
<br>
US-led forces and various Gulf states, commentary on America's
<br>
superior weapons technology, and the human interest angles on
<br>
soldier life in the desert - are almost totally absent from coverage
<br>
outside the US.
<br>
<p>&quot;Sure, the news we get in the Arab world is slanted,&quot; admits Hussein
<br>
Amin, chair of the department of journalism and mass communication
<br>
at Cairo's American University. &quot;In the same way the news received
<br>
in the US is biased.&quot;&quot;
