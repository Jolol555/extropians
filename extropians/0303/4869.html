<br>
case of failures in said ideology. That is, lock-in effect. The *reason* some 
<br>
people are more poor and ignorant than others is that privilege can be 
<br>
inherited. Can't get rid of inheritance without statist and coercive tactics. 
<br>
Can't keep inheritance and still compete on a level playing field.
<br>
<p>Alex,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, the answer has become increasingly obvious over the past one 
<br>
hundred years.  According to The Bell Curve the society developed an economy 
<br>
that has become increasingly high tech.  Since about 1900 it has increasingly 
<br>
favored those that are in the top 5% of intelligence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some say the old money has increasingly had to hire the highly 
<br>
intelligent at the top executive level as their businesses have become too 
<br>
complex for the old money to operate.  Now some are saying we are seeing some 
<br>
regular donnybrooks in the boardrooms as the hired hands demand more and more 
<br>
(in reward and in decision making power) from the old money.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some purport to see a danger in the hired hands and the old money 
<br>
teaming up politically to the detriment of the rest of us.
