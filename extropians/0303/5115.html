<p>
I initially questioned Charles:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If the answer is no, then you do not diminish Lee's main argument that these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;anti-war&quot; and even worse &quot;peace&quot; (whatever that fanciful concept means to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million different people) protesters ONLY criticize US intervention abroad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I protest when those who claim to represent me engage in actions I find 
<br>
immoral.  (It's less than clear to me what sense it makes to protest 
<br>
someone who doesn't claim to represent me anyway.)&quot;
<br>
<p>So you would then agree that it is inappropriate for those abroad to protest 
<br>
the US campaign against Saddam Hussein, given that they did not also protest 
<br>
the aforementioned aggression of North Vietnam, the Soviet Union, and the 
<br>
French decision to remove Bokassa?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And these protesters do this despite the fact that said interventions, like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US's in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Korea, have the potential to 
</em><br>
significantly 
<br>
<em>&gt;better the quality of life for the people in those countries, unlike most of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Getting bombs dropped on you head always improves your viewpoint.  And 
<br>
having your water supplies destroyed.  etc.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, you either ignored or conveniently edited out my point regarding the 
<br>
fact that the United States has gone to tremendous strides to avoid civilian 
<br>
casualties. We could simply &quot;bomb the hell&quot; out of Baghdad indiscriminately, 
<br>
just as we could have flooded the dikes in North Vietnam, causing millions of 
<br>
civilian deaths but bringing those conflicts to swifter resolutions. And yet, 
<br>
unlike our adversaries in Baghdad or Hanoi, mass terror is not our policy. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are you going to seriously argue that the Iraqi people will not benefit from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the removal of Saddam Hussein? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;If that were the only effect, then I wouldn't make that assertion.  But 
<br>
actually I expect that to be a minor benefit that they may obtain, if 
<br>
the puppet we put in isn't even worse.  (Remember, we put him in 
<br>
originally.)&quot;
<br>
<p>No, we did not &quot;put him in originally.&quot; We certainly did aid his regime in 
<br>
his war against the Iranians. But so what? That fact alone does not look at 
<br>
that decision in any historical perspective nor does it prohibit us from our 
<br>
current action. We heavily aided the Soviet Union during World War II, a 
<br>
temporary alliance that gave way to inevitable conflict when our common enemy 
<br>
had been vanquished.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let me address this on two points. First, you are being intellectually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dishonest if you are in any way suggesting that the United States is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intentionally attempting to inflict mass casualties on the Iraqi people. 
</em><br>
They 
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;They are doing it intentionally in the sense that they are criminally 
<br>
negligent if they didn't know ahead of time that this would happen.  I'm 
<br>
not claiming that they planned to do it, but rather that they had to 
<br>
know that this would be one of the effects.  &quot;Collateral damage&quot; I 
<br>
believe the term is.&quot;
<br>
<p>You claim we are &quot;criminally negligent&quot; for causing a limited number of 
<br>
civilian deaths. What is Saddam Hussein then? It is absolutely ludicrous to 
<br>
suggest that the amount of civilian casualties will approach any where near 
<br>
the number of Iraqi deaths Hussein's regime is responsible for. It is only 
<br>
logical to assume that the number of those butchered by that regime will only 
<br>
continue to grow. The UN has done nothing to abate this situation. They did 
<br>
nothing to stop genocide in Cambodia, Laos, Ethopia, the Soviet Union, China, 
<br>
Rwanda, and a ton of other locales in the world. Are you suggesting that the 
<br>
limited number of 1000-6000 (the estimates in Afghanistan) is worse than the 
<br>
continued mass murder that will be inflicted on the Iraqis by Hussein and his 
<br>
heirs apparent? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And please correct me if I'm wrong Charles, but if you accept that Hussein 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;is (or was) evil&quot; then you must then accept the conservative estimates that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he is responsible for the deaths of at least 200,000 of his own people. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I don't have any basis to accept or reject any particular set of 
<br>
numbers.  But there's a big difference between his doing it and our 
<br>
doing it.  If he does it, then he is the villian.  If we do it, then we 
<br>
are.&quot;
<br>
<p>The end result will be a better quality of life for the Iraqis with a better 
<br>
government. Are you going to offer that the Taliban or the Soviet proxies 
<br>
were better for Afghanistan than Hamid Karzai's regime? The United States, 
<br>
unlike the Soviets, does not have a long history of bringing WORSE regimes to 
<br>
these nations. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...That being said, in the long run, more lives will be saved through our 
</em><br>
&quot;war 
<br>
<em>&gt;of aggression&quot; than by allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power. Not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This may or may not be true.  It remains to be proven.  Sometimes we 
<br>
have replaced one vile madman with another, sometimes we have improved 
<br>
things, sometimes we have made them worse.  Usually on close examination 
<br>
it turns out that we acted in what we saw as our own self-interest, and 
<br>
any moralistic hand-wringing was just that.&quot;
<br>
<p>I have never on this forum ever said that we have acted in anything beyond 
<br>
our own self-interest internationally. I have made a point of illustrating 
<br>
that is not a bad thing. However, there is a huge difference between the 
<br>
self-interest of the United States and, for example, the totalitarians of the 
<br>
Soviet Union, North Korea, North Vietnam, or Iraq. It is quite evident that 
<br>
you enjoy bashing the United States. Now, please provide ONE nation that has 
<br>
a better history of spreading the causes of democracy and freedom abroad than 
<br>
the United States.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;mention the fact that the quality of life of the people of Iraq will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improved, just as &quot;amazingly&quot; happens almost every time the United States 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intervenes abroad. I think we all recall the South Koreans, Greeks, 
</em><br>
Japanese, 
<br>
<em>&gt;West Germans, and Afghans, among others, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;MacArthur and Marshall were extraordinary generals.  And Hitler was the 
<br>
kind of villian that Hussein only has wet dreams about.  And we occupied 
<br>
Japan for twenty years.  But I can also recall many other events that 
<br>
turned out much worse.  The Dominican Republic comes to mind as an example.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, you may criticize the United States all you like. As a matter of fact, 
<br>
I recommend it in regard to the policies of the Johnson administration. 
<br>
However, the Trujillo regime that was in power in the Dominican Republic from 
<br>
the 1930's through the 60's was certainly worse than what came after it. And 
<br>
more to the point, it is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that democracy would 
<br>
be in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Greece, among a score of other 
<br>
countries without direct actions taken by the United States. Please 
<br>
illustrate to me what other nations can make this claim?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would simply ask what your justification would be for removing Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hussein, since apparently our own defense and improving the quality of life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the Iraqis are not sufficient in your view. And again, I hope that I will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I haven't seen any convincing evidence that he was a threat to us.  It's 
<br>
true my evidence that he wasn't is quite weak, but not, I think, as weak 
<br>
as relying on the honestly of a Prince (i.e., Bush, but the reference 
<br>
was via Machievelli).&quot;
<br>
<p>So, without commenting further, note the ease with which you criticize Bush 
<br>
and not Saddam Hussein.
<br>
<p>&quot;The French have taken the position they have at least in part because we 
<br>
are cutting them out of the oil.  Is that what you mean?  Yes, when they 
<br>
are moralistic at this position then they are hypocritical.  But they 
<br>
aren't claiming to represent me.&quot;
<br>
<p>But they, like the UN, have no business denouncing this action given they 
<br>
have engaged in it themselves with even less provocation (in your view), or 
<br>
done nothing at all to prevent human castrophe throughout the globe.
<br>
<p>&quot;I haven't looked at the Bokassa regime.  I doubt that I would approve, 
<br>
but as far as I know I'm neither supporting nor opposing them.  The 
<br>
world's a bit place, and I don't see it as my job to try to police the 
<br>
whole thing.  (And I'd rather that it didn't try to police me, either.  
<br>
So, e.g., I'm against the WTO.)&quot;
<br>
<p>Nor is the United States policing &quot;the whole thing.&quot; If it were, then it 
<br>
would also be in the process of removing the totalitarian regimes in Vietnam 
<br>
and in Laos. These regimes are of the exact same character and merit of 
<br>
Saddam's, save for the fact that they have not been in active pursuit (no 
<br>
doubt due to the fact they lack the oil revenue) of weapons of mass 
<br>
destruction. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ever vigilant for signs of further French wars of aggression,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Max Plumm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
OK.  Do they represent you?
<br>
<p>No, but given that the US is merely engaging in a more legitimate form of the 
<br>
&quot;French doctrine&quot; of thug regime change, we must remain ever vigilant...:)
