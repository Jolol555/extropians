<p>
Joao,
<br>
<p>&quot;Whole genome engineering&quot; is precisely what it sounds like -- being
<br>
able to design and engineer &quot;whole&quot; genomes.  It is what the Dept.
<br>
of Energy has given a very large grant to the &quot;Institute for Biological
<br>
Energy Alternatives&quot; to pull off, but I think/hope that Robiobotics
<br>
may be ahead of them.  We shall see.
<br>
<p>I agree that HIV is a nasty/messy problem, in large part because of
<br>
its variability.  Also in large part because we don't know everything
<br>
within cells that it is messing around with.  But I'm reasonably
<br>
optimistic that if we can stop it at the receptor level we will
<br>
defeat it.  (If it can't get in, it can't replicate.)  The National
<br>
Science Foundation also appears to be pushing the crystallography
<br>
capabilities into the 10,000+ per year level.  We *are* going to
<br>
know what everything inside looks like (membrane proteins are a
<br>
bit trickier because they don't crystalize as easily, but &quot;Blue Gene&quot;
<br>
may help us out significantly in that respect).  But I'd say we are
<br>
going to have a *very* good picture of the &quot;structures&quot; of the human genome
<br>
by sometime between 2005-2010.  The growth in PDB entries is tracking
<br>
the growth in Genbank entries with perhaps a 5-8 year lag time.
<br>
<p>I also agree that aging will be a very very complex problem to solve.
<br>
*But* we have multiple examples (tortises, whales, rockfish, parrots,
<br>
etc) of species that already have evolved genomes that are probably
<br>
quite good at preserving an individual.
<br>
<p>We don't have to &quot;invent&quot; when we can copy.
<br>
<p>So between &quot;whole genome engineering&quot;, which I hope will allow us to
<br>
&quot;patch&quot; our genomes using intracellular bacteria (or similar bionanotech)
<br>
and real nanotech (which will allow us to rewrite the &quot;natural&quot; programs)
<br>
I'm reasonably optimistic.
<br>
<p>Of course there is a lot of work to do, the comparative genomics of
<br>
the species I mention above, is alone, a huge amount of work.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Robert
