<p>That's an interesting point, though I don't support your strong anti-war
<br>
sentiments. I'm more or less neutral to slightly pro-war, with some very
<br>
serious reservations about this new direction in US Foreign policy. I don't
<br>
pretend to know the absolute truth about the justness or lack thereof of
<br>
this invasion. I'm doing my best to be a patriotic supporter while also
<br>
trying to trust the wisdom and classified knowledge of very smart and
<br>
experienced and educated people like Rumsfeld and Rice. Their credentials
<br>
are beyond reproach. (In fact I'd consider voting Dr. Rice for president!
<br>
Too bad the US is probably not yet ready for a black woman president.) 
<br>
<p>But still it's an interesting point that you make. I wonder if the
<br>
Pentagon/White House decided to avoid the label &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot;
<br>
for the reason you suggest. It would after all have been a more poetic and
<br>
appropriate name for the operation, but the acronym is embarrassing.
<br>
<p>I do agree with you that one would need to be wearing rose-colored glasses
<br>
to not see that oil is at least one of the important factors driving this
<br>
war. At someone else quoted him here, at least Murdoch was honest enough to
<br>
come right out and say so.
