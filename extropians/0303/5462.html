John Grigg:
<br>
<em>&gt;I quote &quot;The ethnic cleanings that Milosevic committed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;probably justified the intervention of NATO.&quot; PROBABLY?? The
</em><br>
<em>&gt;U.S. and especially the European NATO members have blood on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their hands for not having intervened MUCH sooner. Thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of lives would have been saved, not to mention the stopping of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rape camps which were set up. PROBABLY??
</em><br>
<p>Dear John,
<br>
<p>I would agree 'probably' too, as there were guilty parties all of
<br>
the way around. I'd like to use this message to point out the value
<br>
of looking at all sides of the story, getting varied information,
<br>
first from people's mouths who are/were there, and second from media
<br>
sources that you trust. Much of the U.S. media was blind regarding
<br>
Kosovo.
<br>
<p>I had just moved to Europe at the time of the 1998 brutalities in
<br>
Kosovo, but one of the facts that I soon discovered regarding the
<br>
Balkan story, is that it was very very messy. There were atrocities
<br>
committed on all sides. NATO had to step in and choose a side, and
<br>
given the overwhelming evidence against the Milosevic's regime, they
<br>
(rightly) went against him. The Albanians in that story were not
<br>
clean, however.
<br>
<p>I doubt many people noticed that the International Criminal Court
<br>
indicted three former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army last
<br>
month. Of course, now some are upset... but this shows you
<br>
how complicated the picture is:

<p>KLA Men Indicted (February 20, 2003)
<br>
&quot;Many Albanians are shocked and angry at The Hague's indictment of
<br>
three former members of the Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) for war
<br>
crimes during the 1998-99 conflict. The three men are the first
<br>
ethnic Albanians to be indicted by The Hague. (Institute of War and
<br>
Peace Reporting)&quot;
<br>
<p>Albania still has a ways to go ...
