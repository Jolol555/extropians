<em>&gt; I don't think that's how karma works.  Rather, if you look at the BBS
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=55166">http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=55166</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you look under the Karma display for each post, you see two links:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [applaud] [smite].  At least, you see this if you're logged in, maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't see them if you're browsing anonymously.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, that must be it.  I see no smite or applaud, and I was
<br>
indeed browsing anonymously.  I can see how this would be
<br>
an enormously useful tool, if we could expand the scope.
<br>
What I am more interested in than smite/applaud would be
<br>
an interest gage, a snore/indeed  choice, indicating the
<br>
level of interest.
<br>
<p>Does it take into account the karma of the applauder/smiter?
<br>
Wouldn't make much sense otherwise.  For the applaud/smite
<br>
feature to be of any use, it would need to record which posts
<br>
received which response.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;OK I looked over the new archive tool, which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;about the coolest thing Ive seen in months.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Was that talking about the BBS interface like the one I gave the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; URL to above?  Or is their another archive that is cool? Hal
</em><br>
<p>Ja, that is the one you posted Hal.  I just hadn't seen
<br>
it before now.  Does it prevent one from smiting oneself?
<br>
Or applauding oneself?
<br>
<p>This notion is filled with interesting self referential
<br>
paradox, ya just gotta love it.  {8-]
<br>
<p>What is karma?  Who wrote it?  spike
