<em>&gt;Can't agree.  No one &quot;taught&quot; the Americans anything.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you cannot say it has become their Nature because dissent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is too widespread.
</em><br>
<p>I think that the real argument is with the development of the human mind. I 
<br>
don't think that genetic disposition matters when it comes to most memes. I 
<br>
would go so far as to say that the mind learns almost all unchangeable 
<br>
dispositions from the enviroment. In that way human nature as we see it 
<br>
wrong. I would even go farther to say that these learned systems are 
<br>
essential for a funtioning human being. This of course would be hard to 
<br>
prove. One would need to raise a human by machine since it's conception 
<br>
inside a vacuum. I am not saying that we are a blank slate. I am saying that 
<br>
our real nature has the ablity to be much more diverse than the one we have 
<br>
learned.
<br>
<p>All memes must follow genetic paths of language. I do not see why this 
<br>
process would evolve more control when the control is already present in the 
<br>
enviroment. People should realize that this enviroment of learning plays as 
<br>
great a part as does genetics. I wonder if one could calculate the time it 
<br>
would take for a human to evolve without this learning. Although such a 
<br>
creature would lose the flexability humans have now. It would still be 
<br>
interesting to find that humans would have taken X billions years to reach 
<br>
this piont given an enviroment where that human would perfectly fit (it's 
<br>
theoretical of course). Then a measurment could be compared to how long it 
<br>
has taken us thus far. The suprising thing would be if the theoretical human 
<br>
would take more than double the time a normal human took to evolve. Then 
<br>
some would say that the &quot;enviromental evolution&quot; plays a larger part than 
<br>
evolution.
<br>
<p>If anyone has any sources on this let me know. Thanks Nate
