Humania said
<br>
<p>&quot;Allright. I give up. No more communication possible. A complete waste of
<br>
time and energy.  The falcons on this list live in a giant bubble and don`t
<br>
even realize that they are isolated in the world. You are lost, my
<br>
un-friends! I am too exhausted to answer the false arguments on this list
<br>
anymore. It is pure disgrace. So let there be war. Let there be celebrations
<br>
of killing children. Let us sit in front of the TV and watch the apparently
<br>
surgical precision of the bombs. What a great laugh! Praise the Lord and
<br>
pass the ammunition!&quot;
<br>
<p>Suffice to say, and not surprisingly, you answered absolutely none of the
<br>
questions.  Can you not even justify your own opinions beyond 'war = bad'
<br>
You call for the ousting of murderous tyrants as war criminals *only* if its
<br>
Bush, and you expect others on this list to think that sounds like a
<br>
reasonable and we thought out opinion?  You support the unconditional
<br>
removal of Bush for something he *might* do but care not about Saddam who
<br>
*has* done those things!   Please try to help us understand, cause, speaking
<br>
for myself, I am quite confused about your line of reasoning.
<br>
<p>You said &quot;but I do support their stance against the Iraq war which is a
<br>
disarmament founded on peaceful methods and more patience.&quot;
<br>
<p>I say again, what if Saddam is not interested in disarmement founded on
<br>
peaceful methods, what would you propose be done then?
<br>
<p>Alas, given the news breaking today it sounds as if all your efforts have
<br>
been wasted anyhow.
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Apparently, Mr. Mania, you have no sense of irony. The respondent was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; using acts that Saddam has committed, and which you and your country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seem blithely unwilling to bring him to task on. The fact that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so willing to remove Mr. Bush for acts which Mr. Saddam has committed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and not willing to remove Mr. Saddam, exposes your hypocrisy and hidden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agenda....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Yes, you are right, I failed to see the irony here. But anyway, your fine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President will be responsible for the deaths of American soldiers and for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invading a country. So, the reasons for accusation remain just the same,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no matter if I failed to detect ironic statements or not.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you now recognize the irony, but do nothing to answer the question? Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you support a move, unilitarerally or multilaterally, to depose Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a war criminal but CALL Bush a war criminal for trying to do exactly
</em><br>
that with Saddam, who IS in fact a war criminal.  Do you not recognize your
<br>
own hypocricy?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I also want Saddam to be removed but not on the cost of a mountain of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilian Iraqui corpses, which will be a war crime.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you want Saddam removed, but at the cost of not a single Iraqi
</em><br>
Civilian?
<br>
<em>&gt; I would ask then, how many corpses has Saddam himself racked up?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conservatives estimates, as others on list have mentioned, are around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 200,000.  How many need he rack up before losing one Iraqi civilian
</em><br>
(Perhaps
<br>
<em>&gt; one he has tied to his front door) to remove him becomes just?  Your
</em><br>
policy
<br>
<em>&gt; of absolutely no civilian casualities if implemented in *any* past war
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; have lead to the immediate and catrastrophic rise to power of any and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totalatrian regimes, we would today be the peoples planet of the soviet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; union.  If you considered Bush a war criminal, would killing one civilian
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; just in ousting his tryannical regime, what if he has all-ready killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100,000s of thousands, and there is no reason to suspect he will stop?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, you seem ready to jump on the 'remove the murderous bastard'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bandwagon only if it is Bush who is the 'murderous bastard'.  Please
</em><br>
outline
<br>
<em>&gt; also a course of action that you would consider just in removing murderous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyrants from power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I never would have thought that I would ever have to defend a pacifist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attitude here on the list when I started reading extropian mails in 1996.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never thought it would be overun with moral relativist apologist hippies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who don't care for the lives of anyone but the individuals in thier own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries.  Take a look at the number of human kills racked up by
</em><br>
murderous
<br>
<em>&gt; tyrannical regimes.  R.J. Rummels excellent site &quot;Power Kills&quot; estimates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that in the 20th century alone these governments have killed 170 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM</a>  I have heard of no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; german forces fighting the murderous North Vietnames attemptes to
</em><br>
slaughter
<br>
<em>&gt; and enslave the entire population of Indochina.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I am amazed how many rednecks are assembled here.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am amazed at your lack of understanding of these geopolitical issues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your absolute pacifism is irrational and illogical, and would lead to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that actually rewards murderous expansionist regimes.  Try plugging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'always cooperate' into any game strategy program and see how long it
</em><br>
lasts.
<br>
<em>&gt; Cooperate with a force invading your country?  Coopoerate with a force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invading another country you are allied with?  Cooperate with a murderous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government killing its own people?  Where does this cooperation lead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;but I do support their stance against the Iraq war which is a disarmament
</em><br>
<em>&gt; founded on peaceful methods and more patience.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You seem oblivious or ignorant of the fact that the inspectors would not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even *be* in Iraq were it not for the credible threat of force from the
</em><br>
US.
<br>
<em>&gt; Note 'Credible' in that statement.  This is why the inspectors were absent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the past 12 years.  What if Saddam, as a murderous tyrant, is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in 'disarmament founded on a peaceful method'?  What would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; propose be done then, just wait and hope he changes his mind, while he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contiues to kill thousands of people?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why so ready to depose Bush for the same crimes that Saddam routinely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commits?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And for the record, I am proudly quite pale.
</em><br>
