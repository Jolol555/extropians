<p>Mike the only source I actually have at my house
<br>
has only one paragraph on the topic with no detail.
<br>
I got thinking it over and realized that since they
<br>
would have had only inertial guidance in those days,
<br>
the sub would need to sight the target via periscope,
<br>
give the missile direction and range, then fire.
<br>
Under those circs, great accuracy was surely an
<br>
overstatement on my part.  Perhaps great accuracy
<br>
by the standards of the day, which would have to be
<br>
compared to a dumb bomb dropped from 20kft, which would
<br>
imply a CEP of probably a good quarter mile.
<br>
<p>Anyways, the source I have is titled &quot;A History of
<br>
the FBM System&quot;, a Lockheeed Martin publication,
<br>
LMSC-F255548, page A-1:
<br>
<p>&quot;This concept [of submerged missile firing] has been
<br>
derived from a World War 2 invention described in
<br>
some captured Nazi documents taken from a captured
<br>
high-level German headquarters.  The proposal involved
<br>
installing mortar tubes on the deck of a U-boat and
<br>
firing mortars at land based targets, while the tubes
<br>
were submerged.  The proposal had, in fact, been
<br>
implemented and actual test firings taken place
<br>
in 1943 with an encouraging amount of success.&quot;
<br>
<p>Another source which I do not currently have
<br>
explained that the German system shot a blast
<br>
of superheated steam into the tube to clear most
<br>
of the water out of the path of the projectile
<br>
a second before launch.  This idea was adopted
<br>
by both the American and the commie sublaunched
<br>
missile systems and is still in use to this day.
