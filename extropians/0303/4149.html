<p>
&quot;History keeps coming back, sometimes like a bad dinner. In case
<br>
you missed the '30s, you could experience it again last week
<br>
watching the Security Council at the United Nations, which begins
<br>
to bear an uncanny resemblance to the late League of Nations.
<br>
Listening to the calm, neutral, simultaneous translation of the
<br>
Security Council's proceedings over calm, neutral, simultaneous
<br>
NPR, one was struck by how exactly this attempt to disarm Iraq
<br>
paralleled the world's efforts in the 1920s to make Germany disarm
<br>
-- in compliance with that defeated country's obligations under the
<br>
Versailles Treaty.  Both regimes swore they were complying. And
<br>
both were engaged in purely a paper exercise. ... After all the
<br>
speechifyin' was through, I clicked off NPR and came away with
<br>
the distinct impression that soon enough we'll be coming over,
<br>
and we won't be back till it's over over there. If then. Because
<br>
we can no longer turn our backs on the world. Because we might
<br>
have to stay -- as long as necessary. We've learned a thing or
<br>
two since the '30s. And even since the '90s. Unlike the French,
<br>
we remember.&quot; --Paul Greenberg
<br>
<p>I suppose, for symmetry, the French won't be happy unless we give Iraq
<br>
the same 21 years to disarm that they gave Germany back then, before
<br>
Germany finally had it and did an end run around France's
<br>
&quot;impenetrable&quot; wall of border fortifications along the Maginot Line. I
<br>
imagine that the French, being French, and therefore never learning
<br>
from military history, think that because Iraq is not a next door
<br>
neighbor that they are therefore immune to attack.
<br>
<p>I would warn them of the current calls in Britain by al Qaeda
<br>
operatives to turn Britain into an Islamist state under Sharia Law.
<br>
France should be getting a similar ultimatum soon.
<br>
<p>Maybe it's just that France LIKES to get it's embassies bombed
<br>
'accidentally'. 
<br>
<p>I think that it is more likely that France sees advantage in forcing
<br>
the US to go it alone, thinking that the more the US attracts the
<br>
negative adoration of the masses of the world, the more likely it will
<br>
be that France can regain its alleged rightful place as the leading
<br>
nation in the world.
<br>
<p>I wonder what the arab word for &quot;Vichy&quot; is?
