Yes.  Not that I expect people to be consistent.  As the most obtrusive

figure the US can expect to gain the most scrutiny.  By and large we've 
<br>
done pretty well, especially in a historical context, but I don't expect

people to notice that.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;unlike our adversaries in Baghdad or Hanoi, mass terror is not our policy. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I didn't ignore it, but despite any care that may have been taken, 
<br>
people are being maimed, killed, wounded, and having their water 
<br>
supplies destroyed.  You can argue all you want that it could have been 
<br>
much worse, but ensuring a large number of survivors who have been 
<br>
grossly damaged by you is going to make you LOTS of enemies.
<br>
<p>N.B.:  survivors.  We are injuring people, and insuring that they, or 
<br>
their relatives, survive.  People that you kill aren't going to hurt 
<br>
you.  People who aren't involved may be disgusted, frightened, etc., but 
<br>
they won't feel vengeful.  People whose children you kill are going to 
<br>
hate you bitterly.   I consider this war to be immoral from the start, 
<br>
but I also consider that it's being conducted in a way that is almost 
<br>
designed to create a large number of bitter enemies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Are you going to seriously argue that the Iraqi people will not benefit from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the removal of Saddam Hussein? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;If that were the only effect, then I wouldn't make that assertion.  But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually I expect that to be a minor benefit that they may obtain, if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the puppet we put in isn't even worse.  (Remember, we put him in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;originally.)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, we did not &quot;put him in originally.&quot; We certainly did aid his regime in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his war against the Iranians. But so what? That fact alone does not look at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that decision in any historical perspective nor does it prohibit us from our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;current action. We heavily aided the Soviet Union during World War II, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporary alliance that gave way to inevitable conflict when our common enemy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;had been vanquished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think you are wrong about that, though I'll need to check.  (I had 
<br>
been told that he worked for/with the CIA, and extrapolated from that, 
<br>
perhaps incorrectly.)  If we didn't put him in, then we have even less 
<br>
moral standing in removing him... so from my point of view, you are 
<br>
saying that I've been giving the US too much credit for moral 
<br>
justification for this war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;They are doing it intentionally in the sense that they are criminally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negligent if they didn't know ahead of time that this would happen.  I'm 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not claiming that they planned to do it, but rather that they had to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know that this would be one of the effects.  &quot;Collateral damage&quot; I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe the term is.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You claim we are &quot;criminally negligent&quot; for causing a limited number of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilian deaths. What is Saddam Hussein then? It is absolutely ludicrous to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No.  I believe that they did know that they would be causing many deaths 
<br>
in non-combatants, and in people who just objected to their homeland 
<br>
being invaded by a foreign power.  I don't feel that they acted in 
<br>
ignorance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;suggest that the amount of civilian casualties will approach any where near 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the number of Iraqi deaths Hussein's regime is responsible for. It is only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It makes a big difference who is doing the vile things.  If we are doing 
<br>
it, then it is our responsibility.  If we are supporting their bein 
<br>
done, then it is partially our responsibility.  If we aren't doing them, 
<br>
then it isn't our responsibility.  We might reasonably assist someone 
<br>
requesting our aid.  In this case I think it would be justified to place 
<br>
a price on Hussein's head (a fairly large one).  But this is because I 
<br>
feel that we are already involved (I still haven't check on your earlier 
<br>
assertion).  If we weren't involved, then I don't feel we would even 
<br>
have the moral right to go that far. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;logical to assume that the number of those butchered by that regime will only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continue to grow. The UN has done nothing to abate this situation. They did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing to stop genocide in Cambodia, Laos, Ethopia, the Soviet Union, China, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rwanda, and a ton of other locales in the world. Are you suggesting that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limited number of 1000-6000 (the estimates in Afghanistan) is worse than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continued mass murder that will be inflicted on the Iraqis by Hussein and his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;heirs apparent? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
There are many massacres occuring in the world.  Are you suggesting that 
<br>
we should invade and destroy whereever they might be about to occur, or 
<br>
have recently occured?  Seriously?  And you are considering that this is 
<br>
not only moral, but demanded by morality?
<br>
I'm sorry, but that's not the way my morality points.  At the most, the 
<br>
absolute most, we could announce, and then follow through with, a policy 
<br>
of placing a price on the heads of state whenever some group (who?) had 
<br>
reached a conclusion that the head of that state had been guilty of mass 
<br>
murder.  (It had better be a fairly large number, or the ex-governor of 
<br>
Texas might find himself on the list.)
<br>
<p>Mind you, I still have questions about the morality of that.  Perhaps it 
<br>
should be limited the the heads of state secret police and allied 
<br>
agencies rather than the head of state himself.  And even so, I'm not 
<br>
sure about the justification used for intervening were we weren't 
<br>
previously involved.  The slim thread of morality is that we wouldn't be 
<br>
encouraging the killing of anyone who wasn't already responsible for 
<br>
murder.  But that's pretty slim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;And please correct me if I'm wrong Charles, but if you accept that Hussein 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;is (or was) evil&quot; then you must then accept the conservative estimates that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;he is responsible for the deaths of at least 200,000 of his own people. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I don't have any basis to accept or reject any particular set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numbers.  But there's a big difference between his doing it and our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing it.  If he does it, then he is the villian.  If we do it, then we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The end result will be a better quality of life for the Iraqis with a better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government. Are you going to offer that the Taliban or the Soviet proxies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were better for Afghanistan than Hamid Karzai's regime? The United States, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unlike the Soviets, does not have a long history of bringing WORSE regimes to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;these nations. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Actually, in many place the US has made things worse.  It does have such 
<br>
a history.  And the USSR suppressed ethnic rivalries that have resulted 
<br>
in massive bloodshed, so one could easily argue that they often made 
<br>
things better.  Both nations generally act in their own perceived self 
<br>
interest, and justify it with fancy speeches.  The US hasn't wanted 
<br>
undefensible territories far from it's borders, but it's been quite 
<br>
eager for various minerals.  The USSR plundered western europe of it's 
<br>
industrial capability when it didn't have it's own (for a combination of 
<br>
reasons).  Neither action seems particularly moral to me, but both have 
<br>
generally made moralistic justifications.  And they US supports corrupt 
<br>
and abusive dictators all over the world, as long as we find them 
<br>
beneficial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;...That being said, in the long run, more lives will be saved through our

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;MacArthur and Marshall were extraordinary generals.  And Hitler was the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of villian that Hussein only has wet dreams about.  And we occupied

<em>&gt;Japan for twenty years.  But I can also recall many other events that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turned out much worse.  The Dominican Republic comes to mind as an example.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Again, you may criticize the United States all you like. As a matter of fact, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I recommend it in regard to the policies of the Johnson administration. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, the Trujillo regime that was in power in the Dominican Republic from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the 1930's through the 60's was certainly worse than what came after it. And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more to the point, it is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that democracy would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Greece, among a score of other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries without direct actions taken by the United States. Please 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;illustrate to me what other nations can make this claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Germany had a democracy before WWII, and would probably have returned to 
<br>
one as a choice after defeat, though our intervention probably hastened 
<br>
things.  Japan's democrary is still largely a matter of form (the same 
<br>
ruling party has been in power since the start, if I'm remembering 
<br>
things correctly).  It may become more democratic with time, or at least 
<br>
adopt the &quot;two identical partys&quot; system that we use.  I'm not really 
<br>
very familiar with South Korea, but I seem to recall that it was 
<br>
basically run by a strong-man... still that was decades ago, and I 
<br>
haven't paid much attention recently.  Taiwan has been under the 
<br>
domination of the Nationalist Party since it took the island, but since 
<br>
their founding strong-man (sorry, I forget his name-- I keep wanting to 
<br>
say Ho Chi Minh or Sun Yat-Sen) died they have been less internally 
<br>
autocratic.  But I understand that the original inhabitants still have 
<br>
essentially no rights.  Greece has been a Kindom, a Democracy, a 
<br>
WarLordShip??, and I guess it may be back to being a democracy again.  
<br>
Again I don't know the details, but I'm guessing that their central 
<br>
government, whatever it's form, is relatively weak (a good thing from my 
<br>
point of view).  And the US supported all of the variants.  The US 
<br>
doesn't really support democracies, though it tends to like oligarcies, 
<br>
and finds it convenient if they pretend to be democracies...  sometimes 
<br>
the pretense will drift into an actuality.  This may be happening in 
<br>
Mexico.  But it isn't a short process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, without commenting further, note the ease with which you criticize Bush 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and not Saddam Hussein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Bush claims to represent me.
