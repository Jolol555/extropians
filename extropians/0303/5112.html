<p><em>&gt; You are right, in the sense that the number of possible reactions is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large.  If I only had a single expectation, and pinned everything on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, then I would agree with your assessment.  But I have a range of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectations that I consider more or less probable.  And one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones that I consider likely is that some measurable fraction of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population will be motivated by revenge.
</em><br>
<p>I see two dynamics here.  One:  some Iraqis (and Arabs, I guess)
<br>
who are not presently violent and who are not terrorists will
<br>
become so  as a result of the present war.
<br>
<p>Two: Some citizens of Arab countries, seeing the downfall of
<br>
Saddam Hussein and linking that outcome to his ruthlessness,
<br>
viciousness, and depravity (or linking it to the power of the
<br>
West) will become less likely to engage in acts of violence or
<br>
terrorism.
<br>
<p>Perhaps someone has enough background or knowledge of the
<br>
countries and people in question to dare speculate?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to my being too &quot;unemotional&quot;, you are probably right.
</em><br>
<p>Let's see.  You had written
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; In a more limited sense, self-defense is normally recognized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; as legitimate.  But as to what should be an expected reaction...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; here we get back to theft being a hanging offense.
</em><br>
<p>and I wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The trouble one has with your &quot;expected reaction&quot; is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your approach seems to be too analytical and devoid of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emotion in the current case at hand, and also that it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; obviously going to differ from person to person and from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; group to group.
</em><br>
<p>That's the context.  I needed that   :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But that's my reaction.  I have the typical nerd detachment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from active interest in politics, though I realize that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not the best reaction.  So I do my best. 
</em><br>
<p>I understand.  Still, the current situation has engaged
<br>
you somewhat.  Perhaps it's the analytical problems of
<br>
predicting threats and predicting future behavior of the
<br>
combatants and nations?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I consider it likely that very few Iraqi support Saddam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This may just make them more angry when they are attacked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the cause of someone they would rather not defend.
</em><br>
<p>Well, could be.  One benefit of the Iraqis losing this
<br>
conflict would be that our curiosity might very well
<br>
be assuaged.  I would hope, if the Americans win, that
<br>
the Iraqis won't be too inhibited to speak the truth,
<br>
whatever it is, about their current situation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And despite the public announcements, it's a bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to surrender to an artillery shell that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fired from beyond your visual horizon.  So people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who might have been our supporters are turned into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our bitter enemies... (or, I admit, perhaps not).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, very hard to call.  A large number of Iraqis living
<br>
in the U.S. at present (admittedly, a biased sample since
<br>
many came because they couldn't get along with the regime
<br>
over there) are impatient with the tactics of the Coalition.
<br>
They're very much afraid that the &quot;human shields&quot; type
<br>
tactics will prolong the war, and that the Coalition
<br>
will foolishly allow such tactics to work.
<br>
<p>I infer that they'd just go in guns blazing, the way
<br>
that all wars were fought until 1950, with little regard
<br>
for the unfortunate civilians who got in the way.
<br>
<p>This bespeaks two phenomena:  one, that the Arab world
<br>
(indeed most of the non-Western world) has by our standards
<br>
rather little regard for life (promoting other values,
<br>
such as honor, piety, etc. above life), and two, that
<br>
just in the last decades the West has for interesting
<br>
reasons evolved to the point that they actually put into
<br>
jeopardy their chances of winning decisively, and do so
<br>
at no little cost.
<br>
