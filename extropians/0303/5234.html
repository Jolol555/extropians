Oh, before some FOX or North fan slams me for bad-mouthing Oliver North: yes
<br>
I do remember that his conviction was later overturned on a technicality.
<br>
But we all know it was a technicality. 
<br>
<p>North was convicted of three felonies, the most egregious of which was his
<br>
destruction and falsification of government documents pertaining to US
<br>
relations with foreign governments. And now FOX news expects us to trust him
<br>
to accurately report international news to the American people. (?)
<br>
<p>I'd sooner trust FOX's laughable, self-promoting, sensationalist war
<br>
correspondent Geraldo Rivera, but then on the other hand Geraldo has already
<br>
been caught once lying to the FOX audience during the war against the
<br>
Taliban.
<br>
<p>The more I watch FOX, the more I realize that it's a news network designed
<br>
for and by morons.

<p><em>&gt; &quot;ANALYSIS: More enthusiasm than news in Fox's coverage of

<em>&gt; war&quot; <a href="http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/local/3_22_03war_aaron.html">http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/local/3_22_03war_aaron.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've been flipping between FOX and CNN from day one of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war. I find this reporter's observations to be true. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree especially with her comment that FOX &quot;appeals to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; younger audience.&quot; I get that impression all the time, from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the language and attitude of the reporters. Among other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things, FOX reporters are more prone to use inflammatory 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language. It's highly sensationalized news reporting. Kinda' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exciting, I would agree, but hardly unbiased! 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CNN is boring by comparison, but in my view news SHOULD be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boring. FOX seems to think news is about entertainment rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than information. And this, no doubt, is the reason FOX's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ratings have climbed. Most people, especially younger people, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to be entertained and excited whenever they turn on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their televisions. I noticed that because FOX has so little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to offer in terms of real war coverage from embedded 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reporters in the field, it tries instead to entertain its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audience with actors in the FOX studio dressed in military 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uniforms. What's up with that?? The fake soldiers draw 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; daggers and point rifles at imaginary enemies, to the sound 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of dramatic war music. How absurd! That's not news. That's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blatant entertainment programming designed to keep FOX's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hawkish right-wing audience from turning the channel back to CNN.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FOX gives me an adrenaline rush, sometimes to the point where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't stand it anymore. I might have liked it back in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 80's, when I was a 20-something hard-line Reaganite who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought he had just &quot;seen the light&quot;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Rah Rah Rah! Go Reagan! Go Bush! Go GOP! Down with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberals! Down with our enemies! Down with the French and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Germans and Russians! Down with the peace-niks! And, above 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, DOWN WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN! OFF WITH HIS HEAD!!!&quot;... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's the kind of zealotry that comes through between the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines from FOX. I guess I'm getting old and maybe a little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jaded. FOX-style reporting annoys me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only FOX news, with its hard-line right-wing audience, could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get away with having a war correspondent like Oliver North. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The FOX audience no doubt considers Oliver North a true 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patriot, and that he might be, but let's not forget that he's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also a convicted felon. I'm surprised they haven't also hired 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; G. Gordon Liddy of Watergate infamy. (Actually I'd bet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars to doughnuts that they've tried to hire him! Last I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heard, Liddy had his own radio show. He's already in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business of spewing anti-leftist hatred on the airwaves, just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not for FOX.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And there should be no disagreement that FOX's other war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspondent Geraldo Rivera is a joke. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When it comes to news, especially international news, I just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want the facts conveyed to me in a non-emotional, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent, mature, matter-of-fact, unbiased manner. I want 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see the big picture from a *global* point of view, not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just from the pro-administration American point of view. I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want pizzazz and excitement and heated emotions. I just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want the facts. CNN isn't perfect, but in my view it meets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the criteria above far better than does FOX. I can watch CNN 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all day long without getting my shorts in a wad.
