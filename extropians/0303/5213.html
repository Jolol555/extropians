<a href="mailto:jordan@chuma.cas.usf.edu?Subject=Re:%20WAR:%20Extropic%20perspectives">jordan@chuma.cas.usf.edu</a> writes: I don't think it's very controversial to say 
<br>
that the U.S. stats on Saddam's kills are questionable. But it stands to 
<br>
reason that the rate of killings would vary with the amount of opposition to 
<br>
his regime, or the perception of threat to the regime. The more he tightened 
<br>
power, and became more confident, the fewer the killings, possibly. And this 
<br>
does not calculate the quality of life for those who survive.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One question has always bothered me.  How can a person that accepts 
<br>
liberty for himself stand to see his fellow man kept in bondage by a 
<br>
Totalitarian killer?  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before our Civil War we learned that the nation could not be half free 
<br>
and half slave.  If there is freedom anywhere the slave will dream of getting 
<br>
to that place and being free.  His owner is then faced with repressive 
<br>
measures to keep the slave or attempting to expand his territory to over run 
<br>
the sanctuary.  Under those choices war becomes inevitable the only question 
<br>
is when.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said further, &quot;We&quot; didn't decide to go to war - only the key 
<br>
decision-makers in the Bush administration, ending with Bush, did. Those who 
<br>
voted for the Bush
<br>
administration and who voted for members of congress who gave it the &quot;blank 
<br>
check&quot; may be considered indirectly responsible.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that all?  How about those that did not go out and vote for the 
<br>
opposition candidate of their choice?  Are they not liable?  How about those 
<br>
that sat around blathering nonsense while their fellow man died either as a 
<br>
slave or died freeing that slave
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to my information there are only 4% of people that are 
<br>
warriors.  I can understand that you might be part of the 96% that really 
<br>
don't belong in combat.  But if you really don't care if Iraqis are killed by 
<br>
Sadaam, or if you just aren't cut out to be a warrior can't you stay our of 
<br>
the way of those that do care?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember being a small boy in the 2nd grade.  In our school district 
<br>
we rode the same bus as the high school kids.  One day the bus driver started 
<br>
picking on me big time.  I still remember the HS boy that stood up to the 
<br>
driver and told him to shut up.  I don't think the situation today is 
<br>
essentially different today than it was that day on the schoolbus nor during 
<br>
the Civil War when my ancestors stood up to free men that were being kept in 
<br>
bondage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Folks, sometimes bad things happen to good people unless other good 
<br>
people stand up to help.  Sadaam is not a good person, if you are helping him 
<br>
you are not filling a good role.
