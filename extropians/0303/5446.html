<p>
I think for some reason people are not reading or responding to things I 
<br>
post. Makes me wonder why, especially with all this ad hominem talk.
<br>
<p>Will people all across the world start to feel powerless? Already I question 
<br>
the amount of impact one person can really make in the world. I often wonder 
<br>
if these great technologies such as AI and nanotech will make a &quot;power 
<br>
elite&quot; in the world. That the people that understand and control these 
<br>
technologies will have the real political power. 1)that these will decide 
<br>
who has the military and economic superiority 2) that these people will be 
<br>
able to use these technologies directly to give themselves even more power
<br>
<p>Did previous technologies create a power elite group? I would have to say 
<br>
that the few people who knew how to build a nuke in 1945 could have had 
<br>
substantial power if they didn't already. Although the nuclear technology 
<br>
didn't make that big of an impact in nonmilitary areas. Also the nuclear 
<br>
technology in no way could be used to directly benefit an individual.
<br>
<p>I fear that the world could enter a stage where a small percentage of people 
<br>
less than .1% could control over 99% of the world.
<br>
1) only the elite will be given the latest upgrades, nano machines
<br>
2) only the elite will be able to control AI to any extent
<br>
<p>I wonder how long the majority of people can be plugged into the matrix. Do 
<br>
you think the majority will be content with virtual reality? We were not 
<br>
content with our matrix, proof = we are still trying to figure it out. What 
<br>
is the role of the individual in the new society? How can the average 
<br>
individual believe that they are changing anything when they spend there 
<br>
whole life in VR. Won't super AI invent purpose if it wants to prevent 
<br>
suicide? Aren't we inventing something in which the majority will be running 
<br>
around in circles not accomplishing anything? You may be asking how is this 
<br>
different than now. It is not, that is the point.
<br>
<p>Eventually all jobs will be of the advanced technologies performed by the 
<br>
highest AI systems those may or may not incorporate human minds. Where will 
<br>
that leave the rest of us? Or will we all become one massive interconnected 
<br>
computer? Where will the majority be until that happens?
