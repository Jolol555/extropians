&quot;The Soviet and US Wars in Afghanistan: Why They Differed&quot;
<br>
<p>from - <a href="http://www.theestimate.com/public/113001.html">http://www.theestimate.com/public/113001.html</a>
<br>
<p>noteable excerpts -
<br>
<p>&quot;It is easy to romanticize the guerrilla. From T.E. Lawrence to Che Guevara,
<br>
guerrilla leaders have often become figures of legend; the late Ahmad Shah
<br>
Mas'oud, who was indeed a highly skillful fighter and tactician, emerged as
<br>
the legendary figure from the war against the Soviets. But Lawrence (who,
<br>
despite his legend, was only an advisor, not a commander of Arab forces) did
<br>
not defeat the Turks merely through the guerrilla tactics mentioned above.
<br>
The Arab irregulars with whom Lawrence fought used armored cars, artillery,
<br>
and aircraft, and even so it was ultimately British and Australian forces
<br>
(along with Arab regulars who are often forgotten) who beat the Turks. Mao
<br>
Zedong's guerrillas might swim like fish in the sea of the people, but it
<br>
was regular People's Liberation Army units which defeated Chiang Kai-shek.
<br>
No Afghan mujahedin leader ever took a city or even a major town from the
<br>
Soviets.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Overall, the military technology of the Soviets was massively superior to
<br>
that of the resistance, but the Stingers provided a force multiplier that
<br>
negated some of the Soviet edge. Without the Stingers and the financial
<br>
support of the US, as well as military and other support from Pakistan, the
<br>
mujahedin might well have been crushed by the Soviets long before 1989&quot;
<br>
<p>And from <a href="http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~eemoise/limit6.html">http://hubcap.clemson.edu/~eemoise/limit6.html</a> some more accurate
<br>
estimates on aide provided to Afghanistan
<br>
<p>&quot;This war began toward the end of Jimmy Carter's term as President of the
<br>
United States. Carter provided some US military aid to the guerrillas
<br>
fighting the Soviets in Afghanistan while he was president. He did not
<br>
provide a huge amount--about $30 million for 1980. Under Ronald Reagan this
<br>
went up $50 million for 1981, $50 million for 1982, $60 million for 1983,
<br>
and $140 million for 1984. These figures do not suggest a huge differenc in
<br>
policy between the Carter and Reagan administrations. One would not expect
<br>
deliveries in the first year after the Soviet invasion of December 1979 to
<br>
have been huge; it could legitimately take some time to get the pipeline
<br>
going. For the first-year deliveries to have been half of the fourth-year
<br>
level actually looks to me as if Carter got things off to a pretty fast
<br>
start. (Figures from Cordesman &amp; Wagner, The Lessons of Modern War, vol. 3,
<br>
The Afghan and Falklands Conflicts, p. 20).
<br>
<p>The big break was between Reagan's first and second terms. US military aid
<br>
jumped to $250 million in 1985, and in succeeding years to $470 million,
<br>
$660 million, and $700 million. In 1986, the US began supplying Stinger
<br>
anti-aircraft missiles to the guerrillas. These imposed such heavy
<br>
casualties on low-flying helicopters and assault planes that the airmobile
<br>
tactics were largely abandoned in 1987, and the Soviet troops returned to a
<br>
strategy of defending strongpoints and supply routes.&quot;
<br>
<p>In short, the guerrilla fighter often thought of as the hero of the Afghans
<br>
and the North Vietnamese was nothing short of a romanticized flight of
<br>
fancy.  It was the millions to billions in aide that these fighters recieved
<br>
that kept them fighting.
