I don't agree with this analysis. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a sense in which these super-viri and any medical, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmental or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other crisis are extropian. Crisis of this sort will require 2 key
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components of successful extropian futures - international 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coordination and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced technological response.  
</em><br>
<p>Some extropians will not agree that international coordination is necessary
<br>
(or desirable) to extropianism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If SARS turns out to be a worldwide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; epidemic it unlikely that most of the world will accept it as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a message from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; god for people to succumb to death.  Instead people will ask 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a cure and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we well know a cure will likely come by way of new medical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the cure makes use of new controversial approaches the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result may well be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mainstreaming and acceptance of the new techniques that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kass and others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decry.  The international cooperation aspects also critical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we begin,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what may well be, a new era of global problems that need to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be approached
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from a global multilateral perspective.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chris  
</em><br>
<p>This could be the outcome. Or, a really bad disease outbreak might lead to a
<br>
global paranoia about spread of disease, and resulting major damage to
<br>
international travel, tourism, and trade. It is likely to reinforce the
<br>
isolationist tendencies building up now in response to the fear campaigns of
<br>
certain world leaders who shall remain nameless, a direction which is highly
<br>
unextropic imo.
<br>
<p>The new stem-cell/cloning related techniques are in a race to bring out
<br>
something spectacular before the naysayers close too many doors. If you want
<br>
something to shake the average westerner by the collar and yell at them
<br>
&quot;Modern microbiological medical techniques are GOOD&quot;, it's stuff like the
<br>
cancer cure that Geron seems to be well on the way towards. If they can come
<br>
out and say &quot;Now we have a real, across the board cure for cancer&quot;, the
<br>
boomers *will* sit up and listen. All questions about aborted foetal
<br>
material will be forgotten; I personally don't think they'd care if it was
<br>
made out of third world children's livers. Never underestimated the power of
<br>
unenlightened self interest. 
<br>
<p>But fear of bad people is an even stronger motivator than selfish gain, it
<br>
appears. SARS would be seen as a plague brought in by foreigners. Not good.
<br>

<br>
<p>&quot;Of course the people don't want war. But after all, it's the leaders of the
<br>
country who determine the policy, and it's always a simple matter to drag
<br>
the people along whether it's a democracy, a fascist dictatorship, or a
<br>
parliament, or a communist dictatorship. Voice or no voice, the people can
<br>
always be brought to the bidding of the leaders. That is easy. All you have
<br>
to do is tell them they are being attacked, and denounce the pacifists for
<br>
lack of patriotism, and exposing the country to greater danger. It works the
<br>
same way in any country.&quot;
