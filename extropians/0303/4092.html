Doctors Use Bone Marrow Stem Cells to Repair a Heart

<p>Doctors have used stem cells in an attempt to repair the heart of a
<br>
16-year-old boy, Dmitri Bonnville, the first time that such an operation
<br>
is known to have been tried in the United States.The procedure builds on

promising work in animals showing that stem cells from the bone marrow

can be used to repair the heart.

<p>Wired - Sixteen-year-old Dimitri Bonnville had already been accidentally

open-heart surgery and suffered a massive heart attack, when doctors

<p>Betterhumans - To rats, whiskers are as important for sensory

information as eyes are to humans. And they could soon be just as

important for a new generation of mobile robots. UK researchers have

received a £430,000 (about US$690,000) grant from the Engineering and

Physical Sciences Research Council to build a robotic system that mimics

rat whiskers. The system could help mobile robots working in confined

<p>NY Times - George Johnson's &quot;Shortcut Through Time&quot; addresses one of the

most excruciatingly complex, mysterious and deeply fascinating topics in
<br>
modern science, namely quantum computing: the manipulation of quantum

states to perform computations far faster than is possible on any

conventional computer. The book's remarkable achievement is that it

makes this deeply arcane topic accessible and understandable — even, I

<p>Science Blog - U.S. soldiers walk down a trail in a war zone. One of

them pulls out a hand-held electronic device and points it at a native
