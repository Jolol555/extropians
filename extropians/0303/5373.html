<p><em>&gt; Ad hominem is *never* correct, John.
</em><br>
<p>Man, I really hate that silly phrase and you are wrong. It is Extropian to
<br>
call something what it actually is and the fact is that on this small planet
<br>
there exist life forms that are callous elitist self-absorbed imbeciles who
<br>
are selfish, clueless and lie because they are intellectual Lilliputians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;if someone on this list were to behave like Cavuto did last night on FOX
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then we'd either collectively ban him from  posting, or else many or most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of us would individually kill-file his email address.
</em><br>
<p>Now that I believe! Last year during the Afghanistan war I called someone,
<br>
with complete accuracy I believe to this day, a blithering idiot. I think if
<br>
you were to total it up you would find there was more comment on my use of
<br>
those two words than there was on the entire damn war; not exactly a triumph
<br>
of Extropian thought in my humble opinion but I could be wrong.
