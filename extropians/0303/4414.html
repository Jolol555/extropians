<em>&gt; There is not a bit of &quot;rectitude&quot; to be had in preemption.
</em><br>
<p>I am going to spend a lot of time repeating that the issue isn't just about 
<br>
Iraq. But to get one Iraq-specific point out of the way...
<br>
<p>From the standpoint of an armistice with dictated terms (not a peace), a 
<br>
military action in response to a violation of the terms of the armistice is 
<br>
not preemption. It would be a cleaner matter in old (Treaty of Westphalia) 
<br>
terms if there had been a tidy declaration of war on both sides, but such 
<br>
seem to have gone out of fashion. I wish I really understood why--I have my 
<br>
suspicions.
<br>
<p>[The UN security council thing makes for muddy waters. The USSR treated the 
<br>
UN as a toothless gabberfest precisely up until the time they sat a session 
<br>
out and the US achieved the utterly unthinkable--rammed through a 
<br>
resolution to fight the Korean War--that was back when the Kuomintang had 
<br>
the China seat. Chastened, the USSR never missed a session after that. So 
<br>
the UN took no action on Hungary or Poland, to name two biggies. 
<br>
Miraculously, the UN got cranked up about Kuwait. So from the standpoint of 
<br>
actual history, there are only two cases, both miracles, in 41 years where 
<br>
the UN gave a military hoot, officially.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we consider preemption to be reasonable then it is certain we are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong in our basic analysis, never mind the particular victims we pick.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure. I used to be sure. As I said, non-solution unsatisfactory. 
<br>
And the even more correct term is not pr-emption, it's PREVENTION, which is 
<br>
an even bigger red flag to the parts of me that are still wired to dislike 
<br>
&quot;status crimes&quot;--making things, rather than actions, unlawful.
<br>
<p>The point being that pre-emption is action taken when an attack is 
<br>
imminent, and prevention is action taken to make attack impossible. I don't 
<br>
like it when, e.g., some busybody want to PREVENT me from doing X or Y or 
<br>
Z. But I don't have a track record as bad as Saddam's. Factor out the &quot;who 
<br>
gassed who&quot; jazz, ignore whether or not he got a green light to roll over 
<br>
Kuwait--he's still killing something like 36,000 of his countrymen every 
<br>
year. That's HIM doing it, as a matter of policy, independent of any effect 
<br>
of sanctions. And I think there's some indication that if somehow Saddam is 
<br>
&quot;contained&quot; for, say, ten more years, another 300,000 to 400,000 of his 
<br>
people will be killed by his policies.
<br>
<p>But I am done talking about Saddam in this post.
<br>
<p>You want everybody to wait until there's a big smoking hole; that's the 
<br>
only fair way to fight. In the abstract, I do agree with you--retaliation 
<br>
is much more clear-cut. But did you actually read the referenced articles, 
<br>
or are you simply reacting to the parts I (/Dan) quoted? The notion that 
<br>
some states are much more functionally sovereign (and more functionally 
<br>
vulnerable) than other is crucial to the conclusions quoted. I am not sure 
<br>
I disagree sharply. I do agree that things are a mess.
<br>
<p>And as the scene is becoming clear, in the general case one can create a 
<br>
big smoking hole without leaving a clear contrail back to the guilty party. 
<br>
It truly is only a matter of time before someone manages to pull that off. 
<br>
What then? And the crucial thing is that superempowerment can lead to a 
<br>
non-state actor deeply damaging a sovereign state. Do we just grimace and 
<br>
shrug when that happens?
<br>
I mean, hey, after all, it's a free world, right?
<br>
<p>I am opposed to human suffering. As one of the quoted parts of the article 
<br>
said, it might very well be that Saddam isn't the droid we're looking for. 
<br>
But it also may be that by granting creeps like him the same standing as 
<br>
leaders of less screwed up countries, we are doing a net disservice to 
<br>
humanity. This presupposes that some creeps really are a lot worse than 
<br>
others--sepecially inasmuch as they might not care who they empower, or 
<br>
might even delight in the deniability of same. The issue needs to be looked 
<br>
at squarely, independent of the situation with Iraq qua Iraq.
<br>
<p>And this is separable from all the things you (I guess) don't like about 
<br>
George Bush. It really is.
<br>
And it is separable from all the things the US has done in foreign arenas 
<br>
in the past that sucked. It really, REALLY is.
<br>
<p>Maybe it _is_ time for &quot;sovereignty lite&quot;. I don't like it much. But I 
<br>
consider the topic to be open for discussion, INDEPENDENT of the presenting 
<br>
situation in/around Iraq, which is why I posted. I suspect that the Treaty 
<br>
of Westphalia is on borrowed time no matter what happens to/in Iraq. And I 
<br>
do not consider dicsussion of such unreasonable. Especially if a paradigm 
<br>
shift really is on the way, for good OR ILL. I am not confident I grok all 
<br>
the ramifications. It doesn't have to imply utter chaos, though that's a 
<br>
comfortably-hysterical view for some.
<br>
<p>I really do have to publish my take on those articles... Or perhaps  just 
<br>
did.
