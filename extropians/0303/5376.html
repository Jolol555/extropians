</em><br>
<p>Huh? There is nothing extropian about personal attacks. In fact it's a
<br>
violation of the extropian guidelines.
<br>
<p>From the guidelines:
<br>
<p>&quot;Personal Attacks: We do not allow personal attacks or libelous statements.
<br>
Those violating this rule may be removed from the List without notice. Those
<br>
guilty of an ad hominem attack (i.e.: attacking the character of a poster
<br>
rather than combating the argument the poster proffers) will be subject to a
<br>
private warning on a first offense and a temporary or permanent ban on each
<br>
subsequent offense.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Clearly Neil Cavuto at FOX News would not last long on the extropian list.
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>Neil Cavuto is not the only offender at FOX, by the way. Bill O'Reilly
<br>
treats most of his talk show guests like dirt. One would almost need to be a
<br>
masochist to want to appear on the O'Reilly Factor.
<br>
<p>I actually once tried to like Bill O'Reilly, because about half the time I
<br>
agree with his views. Unfortunately his style is just too abusive and
<br>
self-serving. He lost me as a potential fan last year when he verbally beat
<br>
the crap out of Ron Crickenberger of the Libertarian Party, who appeared on
<br>
the O'Reilly Factor in a sincere attempt to present the LP's position
<br>
regarding the War on Drugs. O'Reilly said something like, &quot;Face it, Mr.
<br>
Crickenberger. You Libertarians are just people who want to use drugs to get
<br>
high, and that's the only reason you want drugs decriminalized.&quot; When
<br>
Crickenberger tried to defend the LP against that outrageous accusation,
<br>
O'Reilly just interrupted him and railroaded him in usual condescending
<br>
style. He never gave Crickenberger a chance to present his argument. If I'd
<br>
had a rock in my hand at the time I might have thrown it at my TV screen.
