<p>(Aside: I'm glad the ExI list is discussing patents again. I see patents
<br>
as a fact of life and something that might make radical life extension
<br>
achievable in my life time because they enable an entrepreneur to
<br>
map out a scheme whereby resources and people might be
<br>
coordinated over a large period of time, real value might be added
<br>
and the various pipers involved in producing the life extending
<br>
products might all be paid. I sure wouldn't want to wait for a
<br>
government to decide that a Manhattan type project was going to
<br>
be undertaken to raise the life expectancy of citizens to 400. I think
<br>
I'd die waiting. Yet ironically, at least to me, the very folks who I
<br>
imagine share my aspiration to do something about the arbitrary
<br>
nature of death and to extend their own life span - because life
<br>
is good - often want to attack exactly the apparatus that *may*
<br>
make such a feat organisationally possible. I don't get how anarchists
<br>
can be extropians, or how international law can be regarded as a
<br>
bad thing, or why free speech appears to some to be an absolute.
<br>
I don't think for a moment that those who seem to hold these views
<br>
are foolish but I suspect that I am thinking at cross purposes to these
<br>
folk and that when we talk although our words may be the same
<br>
our referents must be different.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; First .. Patents reduce freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting thesis. Wonder what it means. Seems to me imperfectly
<br>
formed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, ......I don't deny for a moment that [patents] encourage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation.  Indeed, that's one reason I oppose them: they encourage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation /for its own sake/
</em><br>
<p>But do they? Don't patents have to be useful? Could it be that the
<br>
complexity of the legal system is being confounded as a variable here?
<br>
<p>ie. Lets say a patent is supposed to be useful and one is approved that
<br>
is not, then at some time it might be challenged. But only a person with
<br>
sufficient money can challenge it. Ok. But then the problem isn't that
<br>
we have patents the problem is that the cost of getting a just ruling on
<br>
an improper patent is too onerous. The problem is that our legal
<br>
system is not producing justice it is producing only order. i.e.. One can
<br>
only get justice in the matter of patents if one can understand the
<br>
legal system and/or afford to use it as an instrument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; over other things like craftsmanship,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gradual refinement and evolution, collaborative development,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition, and other things I think are more important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than mere innovation.  If people invent novel things, that's fine,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I also want people to make not-so-novel things, interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combinations, refinements, and customisations of existing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things.
</em><br>
<p>This I understand I think. Me too. There is heaps of value
<br>
that can be added by people doing essentially the same things like
<br>
personal services but for different people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I want more people competing to find cheaper ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce things.  I want people to find and exploit more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markets for things than the inventor ever imagined.
</em><br>
<p>Not me. I don't want to either encourage or discourage competition
<br>
in any absolute sense. Competition will arise without my assisting it
<br>
and I can at best redirect it slightly. But given that decision makers
<br>
can choose to cooperate or compete I am in favour of the greater
<br>
complexity and nuance in need and want satisfaction that comes
<br>
from having societal structures such as laws.
<br>
<p>Laws, after all, if these arise between free agents are also an extension
<br>
of an aspect of those agents freely choosing not to compete when
<br>
competition is wasteful and suboptimal. I could not build a biotech 
<br>
&nbsp;company to go after anti-aging even on paper if I could not assume
<br>
&nbsp;that complex agents and resources were potentially available.
<br>
<p>I don't want to have to compete to mine every mineral to produce
<br>
every tool whilst also having to chase away every bandit that gets their
<br>
eye on some shiny bauble I dig up. Patents enable greater structure.
<br>
Sure this means additional complexity. Sure it means that those who
<br>
can't handle the additional complexity or can't afford it won't do so
<br>
well. But we can't dumb everything down to what the lowest common
<br>
denominator can understand all the time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The idea that inventors inherently deserve reward is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communist fallacy of the labour theory of value: the totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discredited idea that the value of a thing is inherent in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creation.
</em><br>
<p>There is truth in this statement I think. But its hard to tease out from
<br>
notions of what communists might think.
<br>
<p>(Aside: The value of a thing, for me anyway is in its usefulness. I find it
<br>
interesting that gold is beginning to be regarded as valuable in some
<br>
circles not just because it is &quot;pretty&quot; or &quot;rare&quot; but because of its
<br>
physical qualities. It can be drawn into a very fine wire. Diamonds
<br>
are at least starting to be respected because they are strong. They
<br>
are carbon-based and they are biocompatible. Diamondoid in
<br>
nanotech engineering speculation at least has some sensible basis
<br>
for being valued.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's simply not true, and policies based on that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea are doomed to failure, as all socialist systems have been.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Value is created by /demand/, and so what should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  rewarded is the ability to fulfil demand, whether by innovation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or other means.
</em><br>
<p>But hang on. Demand from where? Thieves fill a demand from
<br>
somewhere.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Without patents, innovation will still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rewarded /when it fulfils a demand/, but not otherwise, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is how it should be.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is that demand for a finished product that may take
<br>
years to develop and that may have to go through FDA approval
<br>
processes etc is real but distant at the R&amp;D stage.
<br>
<p>If we want better medicines and life extending technology (and we
<br>
don't have the power to throw out the FDA and the government
<br>
and a whole lot of other &quot;structure&quot; some of which is admittedly
<br>
very suboptimal) than we have to work with what we have.
<br>
<p>Patents afford the ability to raise funds from those who have money
<br>
which is needed to build projects which require funding.
<br>
<p>I am not blindly in favour of all patents or of all patent systems, but
<br>
suboptimal solutions to me suggest a need to improve them whereas
<br>
to others they seem to suggest a sort of need for a scorched earth
<br>
policy.
<br>
<p>We in 2003 sit astride something like 5,000 years of recorded history
<br>
in a bootstrapping operation of civilization that goes back at least
<br>
10 times that long and arguable to when our ancestors crawled out of
<br>
the slime. We don't need to throw everything out that isn't perfect.
<br>
We've never had perfect before. The point is to improve on the tools
<br>
and systems we have. I reckon we need to be concerned not so much
<br>
&nbsp;with illusions of perfection but with goals that are worth pursuing and
<br>
&nbsp;which we will willingly pursue together. Then we work out how to add
<br>
as much value by drawing on the stock of knowledge already
<br>
accumulated and to extrapolate from this and learn new things. But there
<br>
is no free lunch from learning. Whilst &quot;we&quot; isn't an exclusive club in the
<br>
sense that anyone needs to prohibited from joining, club membership is
<br>
still exclusive in the sense that life itself is self-selecting. Those that
<br>
don't
<br>
want to be a part of the move to greater complexity and won't engage
<br>
with the issues of the times don't have to be but move forward doesn't
<br>
stop for recalcitrants. And none of us at this stage, so far as I can tell,
<br>
have the capacity to drag screaming into the future those that don't
<br>
want to go there. We will need structures to coordinate the efforts of
<br>
free agents. Patents look to me to be part of that structure.
