<p>Yes and no. Just look what the EU stance on GM food has done to
<br>
people in Africa. By the combination of FUD about the safety and
<br>
an unwillingness to accept import if there is a slight chance of
<br>
&quot;contamination&quot; EU has been quite powerful in preventing the
<br>
usage of GMOs in Africa - including accepting US grain. In the
<br>
end, people suffer and die due to bad policies and bad memes. 
<br>
<p>While I think such hindrances will vanish in the long run, that
<br>
can be a very long run indeed. And the path there can be quite
<br>
bloody. So ignoring US and Europa opinions because they are not
<br>
ESS is a risky strategy if we want good things for ourselves and
<br>
others. Policies instituted by the most economically and 
<br>
politically powerful nations and institutions have huge impacts, 
<br>
and even if they will go the way of the Galileo trial they can 
<br>
temporarily (like across our lifetime) hinder development 
<br>
worldwide. 
<br>
<p>The right thing to do is to deal with the opinions here, and
<br>
promote our alternatives. It might not completely change the
<br>
biases here, but it might mean avoiding a future War on
<br>
Unacceptable Biotech by making the spectrum of possible views 
<br>
broader and the debate more complex. It can also help make some 
<br>
of the huge resources here available for investment elsewhere in 
<br>
good research, if it is not acceptable here.
