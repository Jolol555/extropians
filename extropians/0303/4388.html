I'll try to put my thoghts down in sme sort of coherent way by the weekend.
<br>
In the mean time, forwarded from my friend Dan L., the below.
<br>
<p>&quot;A DISMAL THOUGHT: I'm left with the conclusion that we will only get such 
<br>
consensus in favor of pre-emption after the destruction of a major Western 
<br>
city, or a chemical or biological catastrophe. In this sense, Blair and 
<br>
Bush may simply be ahead of their time. And what they see as the potential  
<br>
threat is so depressing and terrifying that it's perhaps only 
<br>
understandable that the world for a while will wish to look the other way. 
<br>
The truth is and we may as well admit it: we have failed to convince the 
<br>
world, just as Churchill failed to convince the world in the 1930s. And as 
<br>
9/11 recedes  a little, we are even tempted to falter in this dreadful 
<br>
analysis ourselves.
<br>
<p>&quot;The difference between now and the 1930s, of course, is that we may now 
<br>
have Churchill in office - but before the world has become convinced of his 
<br>
rectitude: history repeated as a deeply tragic farce.
<br>
<p>&quot;STILL, SKEPTICISM: To add to the complications, we may be right about the 
<br>
basic analysis but wrong in this particular case.&quot; --Andrew Sullivan
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Grist for the mill.... I tried to find more Lee Harris stuff (referenced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below) but the link referred to was dead, for now at least. But I did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find this unrelated quote:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; One of the most tragic victims of liberal ideology has been liberal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; idealism, by which I mean the impulse to make the world a better place. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; For nowadays the question that most preoccupies liberals is not so much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whether good is being done, but whether it is being done the right way, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; or‹even worse‹whether it is being done by the right party. For the goal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is no longer one of trying to improve the lot of the average human being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by any means practicable, but rather the implementation of a social 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; policy that is in accordance with the conventional dogmas of modern 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; liberalism. -- Lee Harris
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gonna have to research more on Robert Kaplan as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, this is Andrew Sullivan's blog front page for the day, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; references these two fellows.

<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ARE WE IN A REALLY NEW WORLD? Yesterday, I suggested that in some ways,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're headed backward toward the nineteenth century. This stimulating, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essay by Lee Harris in TCS argues the opposite: that weapons of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction together with fantasist Islamism or nihilist totalitarianism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make our predicament completely and world-historically new. I wish I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a way to rebut this theory easily, but I cannot. I've learned a lot 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert Kaplan's analysis of a complete security breakdown in whole parts  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the globe; what I haven't put together coherently in my own head - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm afraid to? - is what the combination of world anarchy and destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology could lead to. In the past, we conceived of the threat of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warfare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming from rival states which had built up various means of economic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thereby military strength. But now we have the reality of completely weak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states, or parasitic states, or failed states or neo-states (like al 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Qaeda)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting nukes by buying them, or stealing them or smuggling the component
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts. They can also find ways to detonate them anonymously so that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilized world is incapable of rational response or even rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deterrence. It seems to me that the chances of something like this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happening are extremely high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THE PRE-EMPTIVE OPTION: Which leaves us with very few good options. But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obvious one is pro-active pre-emption: going in and getting rid of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regimes and entities, destroying them, or occupying them. But doing so -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invading terrorism-sponsoring states, before they have formally attacked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - violates the basic principles of the international order we have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understandably come to cherish. So we have a profound - and new - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between security and sovereignty, between a catastrophe-free world and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law. You might be able to find a way to square this cricle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the civilized countries in the world agreed about the nature of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat and exercized collective security against rogue states - but it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to be collective security with one standard for the civilized world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one for everywhere else. Our current U.N. (which includes rogues states 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes no distinction between them and others) naturally doesn't recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a double-standard. Moreover our civilized partners simply don't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the threat is that grave. Even after 9/11, even many Americans don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe the threat is that serious. This is therefore the key context of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current impasse. Europeans simply don't believe that we're living in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; radically more dangerous and unstable world. Or they think that mild
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measures can temporarily solve the problem - like porous and largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inneffective inspection regimes in Iraq. So we are at a deadlock. And if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot get consensus on Iraq - with umpteen U.N. resolutions and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precedent of a previous unprovoked war - what hope is there of getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consensus if Iran's mullahs go nuclear? Or North Korea's nut-case gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several nukes? Or someone else out there we have yet to hear from decides 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go to heaven via a suitcase nuke in L.A.?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A DISMAL THOUGHT: I'm left with the conclusion that we will only get such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consensus in favor of pre-emption after the destruction of a major 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; city, or a chemical or biological catastrophe. In this sense, Blair and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may simply be ahead of their time. And what they see as the potential 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; is so depressing and terrifying that it's perhaps only understandabl that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world for a while will wish to look the other way. The truth is and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little, we are even tempted to falter in this dreadful analysis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ourselves.

<em>&gt; The difference between now and the 1930s, of course, is that we may now

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Churchill in office - but before the world has become convinced of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rectitude: history repeated as a deeply tragic farce.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; STILL, SKEPTICISM: To add to the complications, we may be right about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic analysis but wrong in this particular case. Perhaps North Korea is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more potentially dangerous and therefore worthy of more immediate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than Iraq. We live in an opaque world, however good our intelligence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; however solid our leadership. I liked this point of Harris's:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Once the world-historical magnitude of the risk is understood, it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for men of good will to differ profoundly over the wisdom of this or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; particular response - and not only possible, but necessary. But this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; done in a climate free of pettiness and personalities: the cult of naïve
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cynicism - that oxymoron that characterizes so much of what passes today 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intellectual sophistication - must be dismantled and as soon as possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are to make our response as intelligent and as creative as it must and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; To call prudence appeasement is wrong. But to call the United States' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; response
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a bid for empire is simply silly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm a little chastened by that criticism. Some on the far left and right  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed appeasing, or even sympathizing with the enemy. Others on the near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left are putting partisanship before strategic clarity. (Others on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are fully clear-sighted about what is at stake.) But some criticism of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq policy is well-intentioned and based not on denial but mere 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prudential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreement. On balance, I think war against Saddam now is essential. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, in retrospect, I fear we may have lost a lot by not going to war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unilaterally months ago. But the most important thing - and this is th 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; main
</em><br>
<em>&gt; import of Harris' essay - is to remember the new realities we're all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make sense of. Just because they're truly terrifying doesn't mean we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safely try to forget them. And it is impossible to keep that context 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our minds without also constantly remembering that day eighteen months
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago. There really is a connection between 9/11 and Iraq - at the deepest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most meaningful level imaginable. We may endure more such days before we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summon the will to do what we have to. Or we may have the luck and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leadership to prevent it. I'm praying for the latter.
