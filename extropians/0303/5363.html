<p><em>&gt; Why is it that liberals are for the most part unable to admit

<em>&gt; that the old major network coverage, ABC, NBC, and CBS, have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a liberal bias?  Why does some CBS insider like Bernard Goldberg
</em><br>
<p>It's because they completely disagree that mainstream media has a liberal
<br>
bias.  Coverage of Clinton and Gore, coverage (or lack) of the WTO and
<br>
globalization issues... they don't see liberal bias.  They see corporate bias.
<br>
They don't watch TV and think &quot;ah!  these people are saying what I'm
<br>
thinking!&quot;
<br>
<p>Or that's my guess, extrapolating from complaints about the New York Times.  I
<br>
don't get my news from TV.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; concerning something like this?  I have two theories.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that they so deeply question the legitimacy of conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; views that by fiat all such views are &quot;right wing extremist&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hence negligible, no matter how often people like Reagan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the Bushes are elected to high office.  This seems just
</em><br>
<p>Do Reagan and the bushes acknowledge the legitimacy of liberal views?  Bush
<br>
the Younger who seems to be on a personal crusade, or Bush the elder who said
<br>
atheists couldn't be good American citizens?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My other theory is that the left has inherited a tradition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or aspects of a tradition, that goes all the way back to Lenin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In revolutionary Russia, Lenin and his followers labeled 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves the Bolsheviks, or &quot;Majority&quot;.  It was a conscious
</em><br>
<p>Lenin is not part of the memetic history of most US liberals.  Really, he's
<br>
not.  This may be hard to accept if you're someone like Dehede who likes to
<br>
slather &quot;socialist&quot; all around, but it's true.  There may be some common roots
<br>
between Lenis and social democracy, going back to the first people outraged at
<br>
the condition of the poor in the 19th century, but that's it.  This
<br>
&quot;Bolshevik&quot; connection is a fantasy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ever since, many on the left appear to believe that they possess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a special dispensation from God or someone to have pre-eminence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in political matters.  The most glaring example is the advent
</em><br>
<p>And the right doesn't have this?  Everyone likes to think they're really in
<br>
the majority, not to mention really in the right.  I'd say the religious right
<br>
does think it has a dispensation from God, pretty literally speaking.  Ten
<br>
Commandments in the courthouse, anti-sodomy law in Texas...
<br>
<p>I'm once again amazed at how allegedly libertarian Extropians band together
<br>
behind a secretive President who's been attacking civil liberties right and
<br>
left and is allied with evangelicals who look forward to the 2nd coming and
<br>
the end of the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Vladimir Lenin!  That they could embrace such a fantastical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion that their views were nearly by definition *correct*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only bespeaks the degree to which this special dispensation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is and was entertained by them. 
</em><br>
<p>That you think any such belief in correctness is primarily limited to the left
<br>
seems fantastical in itself.  And from what I've seen of recent history,
<br>
American liberals have been almost hobbled by their own doubt, vs. the
<br>
coherent self-righteousness on the right.
<br>
<p>Not that there aren't those full of conviction on the left.  But I don't think
<br>
'liberal' and 'left' are wholly synonomous, just as 'conservative' and 'right'
<br>
aren't either... isolationist and small-government conservatives have little
<br>
to do with the neocons dreaming of Pax Americana.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have always been eager to find any examples of non-symmetry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between opposing ideologies, because on most counts, e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, morality, education, acquaintance with the facts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;common sense&quot;, etc., the sides are of course quite equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balanced.
</em><br>
<p>There's the geographical non-symmetry.  The left/liberals clusters along the
<br>
west and northeast coasts, with bastions in big cities and college towns all
<br>
around; the right/conservatives seem to cluster in the South and Great Plain,
<br>
and rural areas all around, except maybe New England, I don't know.
