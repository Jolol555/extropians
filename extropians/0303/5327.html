<br>
<p><em>&gt; I like Fox as a determined counter-balance to the &quot;major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; networks&quot; and CNN which I have monitored to frequently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a Liberal-Bias on foreign policy.  FoxNews has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conservative-Rightist bias on foreign policy, and it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there that I find myself most in tune with. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this has got to be correct, and also an honest statement
<br>
of how you, Mitch, see the situation.  I have found it common
<br>
for conservatives, or conservative/libertarians to readily
<br>
admit that Fox News has a conservative presentation.
<br>
<p>But a telling, peculiar asymmetry exists.
<br>
<p>Why is it that liberals are for the most part unable to admit
<br>
that the old major network coverage, ABC, NBC, and CBS, have
<br>
a liberal bias?  Why does some CBS insider like Bernard Goldberg
<br>
have to right a book &quot;Bias&quot;, or do other writers such as
<br>
William McGowan have to write extremely well documented books
<br>
like &quot;Coloring the News&quot; to make the point that should have
<br>
been obvious to anyone for the last 40 years?
<br>
<p>What is it about the left that they cannot admit the truth
<br>
concerning something like this?  I have two theories.  One
<br>
is that they so deeply question the legitimacy of conservative
<br>
views that by fiat all such views are &quot;right wing extremist&quot;
<br>
and hence negligible, no matter how often people like Reagan
<br>
or the Bushes are elected to high office.  This seems just
<br>
rather blind.
<br>
<p>My other theory is that the left has inherited a tradition,
<br>
or aspects of a tradition, that goes all the way back to Lenin.
<br>
In revolutionary Russia, Lenin and his followers labeled 
<br>
themselves the Bolsheviks, or &quot;Majority&quot;.  It was a conscious
<br>
political move to (evidently) subtly affect the semantics of
<br>
the discourse, so that they'd retain a psychological advantage.
<br>
<p>Ever since, many on the left appear to believe that they possess
<br>
a special dispensation from God or someone to have pre-eminence
<br>
in political matters.  The most glaring example is the advent
<br>
on university campuses in the 1980s and 1990s of the &quot;politically
<br>
correct&quot; movement.  This notion was sincerely held by many that
<br>
their adversaries held a palpably &quot;incorrect&quot; view---shades of
<br>
Vladimir Lenin!  That they could embrace such a fantastical
<br>
notion that their views were nearly by definition *correct*
<br>
only bespeaks the degree to which this special dispensation
<br>
is and was entertained by them. 
<br>
<p>I have always been eager to find any examples of non-symmetry
<br>
between opposing ideologies, because on most counts, e.g.,
<br>
intelligence, morality, education, acquaintance with the facts,
<br>
&quot;common sense&quot;, etc., the sides are of course quite equally
<br>
balanced.
