<p>That's *exactly* right. People seem by and large to be having a fairly
<br>
awful time, especially as the aches and poor vision and bad sleep and poor
<br>
digestion of later years start to seep in. `What, more of *this*?' 
<br>
<p>The world gets murky. Doing the simplest thing becomes a hassle, and the
<br>
joys to be had from it are lessened.
<br>
<p>Many of the posters on this list are too young to know from the inside how
<br>
tedious and dispiriting that is. Trust me. If older people get the idea
<br>
(mistakenly in the longer term but valid right now) that life extension
<br>
means *more of this crap*, it isn't at all like a healthy young adult
<br>
foreseeing decades or centuries more of raves, waves, delirious sex, mind
<br>
bending transmitteri, movies and books you haven't already seen in essence
<br>
a hundred times... It's like going to grey work on a Monday morning in
<br>
smog, with aching teeth and a cold, for the rest of eternity. That's on a
<br>
good day. Luckily I'm not at that point yet (except on a *bad* day), but I
<br>
can empathize all too readily.
<br>
<p>We have to sell the idea of extended or recovered *youthfulness*. On the
<br>
face of it, that's about as plausible as Jesus Saves or Qi Energy
<br>
Saves--less, though, because it lacks the misty supernatural pizzazz escape
<br>
clauses of faith. To the extent that we sincerely expect scientific
<br>
advances to produce these benefits, we have to back up our
<br>
good-times-are-coming spiel with sober evidence. That's hard.
