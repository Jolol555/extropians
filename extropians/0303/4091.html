I have seen both the Prius and the Insight, and have been disappointed by 
<br>
their humble size. I have heard that driving  these cars during  wintertime 
<br>
snow (not typically associated as a Cali issue) makes them hard to maneuver, 
<br>
because of their light weight. Not exactly a seller in Ohio or Nebraska, is 
<br>
it? 
<br>
<p>The article by MIT, was focused on the sources of hydrogen, for h² cars, 
<br>
rather than the vehicles themselves. The chief sources of hydrogen would be 
<br>
natural gas (me-thane) as the Brits pronounce it. MIT seems less focused on 
<br>
producing hydrogen abundantly and cheaply; storage and  transmission, etc. 
<br>
Then we could use water as a working material, rather then natural gas, to 
<br>
make h².
<br>
<p>Bill K noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Even General Motors and Chevrolet are announcing plans for hybrid
<br>
vehicles. But I can foresee problems persuading Mike Lorrey to drive an
<br>
SUV that goes putt-a-putt-a-putt with a lawnmower-size engine! They will
<br>
have to put electronics in to connect the sound system to the gas pedal
<br>
and broadcast loud roaring noises when you tramp on the gas pedal.
<br>
<p>Keep on truckin'     BillK &gt;&gt;
