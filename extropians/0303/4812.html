Hm.  I foresee the richest individual(s) in the region making threats of      
<br>
airstrikes against all parties too poor to launch a retaliatory airstrike.    
<br>
Since the airstrike doesn't need to be carried out, except perhaps for        
<br>
one or two examples, this should provide a steady revenue stream for the      
<br>
individuals rich enough to afford airstrikes, but the airstrike company       
<br>
itself will eventually go bankrupt, perhaps being bought out by the           
<br>
<p><p>What would push it into bankruptcy? It keeps the cash even if the funds never
<br>
acchieve threshold levels. Conversely, what would be the revenue stream of the
<br>
despots? Blackmailing the people? Why would the people pay the middlemen when
<br>
they can go straight to the violence-management agent and put money into their
<br>
anti-strike and MAD funds?

<br>
violence monopolists.  Similarly, the rich individual could launch a          
<br>
preemptive strike at any poor individuals who showed signs of clubbing up     
<br>
to buy a strike at the rich individual.                                       
<br>
<p><p>It's a lot more expensive for one agent to actually launch multiple strikes
<br>
than for multiple agents to contribute to one strike fund. In the big picture,
<br>
your ability to attack/defend is a function of how much wealth you have. The
<br>
assumption of a market is that though there will be rich and poor, the force
<br>
of numbers will be in equilibrium with individual wealth and the overall
<br>
'will' of society is triangulated. The violence industry doesn't efficiently
<br>
reflect society's 'will' at this time, because it is almost entirely composed
<br>
of state monopolies.

Looks just like our same old world to me.                                     
<br>
<p><p>A number of important differences. One of which is that in our world,
<br>
airstrikes are an all-or-none proposition with a tremendous cost of entry and
<br>
no option of fractional airstrikes. Nor is automated retaliation currently
<br>
available to ordinary individuals.
<br>
<p>Also, the lone-nut dilemma will be something we'll have to face
<br>
eventually. Might as well start the learning curve now, before even more
<br>
destructive weapons will become even more widely available to individuals.
<br>
<p>Come to think of it, in the current world, it might be instructive to figure
<br>
out what social/game-theory/psychological forces prevent people living in
<br>
areas with lax gun laws (e.g. TX) from actually going out and killing each
<br>
other indiscriminately in huge numbers. Figure that one out, and you'll be one
<br>
step closer to figuring out what will keep people from grey-gooing each other
<br>
to death.
