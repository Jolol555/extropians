<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steve,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I think you and I may have a problem of not having made the meaning
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; our labels both clear and agreed upon.
</em><br>
<p>This is clearly the case. Sorry about that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        For example, imperialism in my mind applies only with the taking of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land.  By that definition you British were had an empire in that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conquered countries and subjected them to your ownership.  By and large
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; US has stayed away from that sort of thing.
</em><br>
<p>Imperialism means a bit more than that. Obviously the core aspect is one
<br>
nation or state ruling over territory not it's own original territory and
<br>
(the really important part) the people who inhabit that territory. It's the
<br>
rule of one people over another that makes a state an empire. An important
<br>
point is that you may not need to directly rule over land/people de jure if
<br>
your power is such that you effectively control it anyway eg British rule
<br>
over about half of India plus places like Argentina. I'm afraid that while
<br>
the US avoided that until the 1890s it caught a bad case after then, viz
<br>
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, the Philippines. The policy followed in the middle east
<br>
after any war will tell us if it has embarked on another round of
<br>
imperialism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        On the other hand some folks talk about cultural empirialism.  That
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term is a little more vague in my mind.  However I happen to be in a
</em><br>
position
<br>
<em>&gt; where I observe everyday the rush of young people around the globe taking
</em><br>
up
<br>
<em>&gt; the standards and pasttimes of American teenagers.  Perhaps you could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe that as cultural imperialism?  On the other hand it seems to be
</em><br>
done
<br>
<em>&gt; without coercion.
</em><br>
<p>I think the concept of cultural imperialism is rubbish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        I confess to not having a clue as to what you are talking about
</em><br>
when
<br>
<em>&gt; you use the term &quot;liberal empiralism.&quot;  In my experience liberal is a term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that socialist apply to themselves to disguise who they really are.  Are
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; suggesting that the Americans will attempt to turn the Iraqi into a bunch
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; democratic socialists?
</em><br>
<p>You need to forget about the unique American use of the word 'liberal' to
<br>
mean 'socialist' - this makes political conversation between Americans (and
<br>
Canadians) and people from other parts of the world unnecessarily difficult.
<br>
&quot;Liberal imperialism&quot; is originally a term used by historians to describe
<br>
the kind of 'New Imperialism' that appeared after the Berlin Conference of
<br>
1878, to some extent in reality, much more in theory. By extension it means
<br>
a policy motivated or justified by the same kinds of ideas. That is, the
<br>
notion that imperialism is not about simply conquering other peoples for
<br>
wealth, power, or glory. It is about advanced or civilised nations ruling
<br>
over other (not so advanced) nations so as to bring them the benefits of
<br>
law, modernity, democracy, Christianity etc. In other words to rule over
<br>
other people for their own good, with a kind of tutelary role. Basically
<br>
it's a fabian welfare state but on an international level (one reason why
<br>
most Fabians were ardent Imperialists). It seems to me that this kind of
<br>
thinking is a major element in much argument about a war on Iraq, e.g the
<br>
idea that the US will reconstruct Iraq in the way it (allegedly) did in
<br>
Germany and Japan after 1945. The faction in Washington and elsewhere that I
<br>
was referring to (see my other response to Lee) are arguing, as I understand
<br>
them, that the unique position of power the US found itself in at the end of
<br>
the COld War gives it the opportunity and the responsibility to shape the
<br>
world in a way that both protects US interests and security and advances
<br>
certain political ideals. Sounds a lot like liberal imperialism to me, could
<br>
come straight out of late nineteenth century British imperialist writings of
<br>
the Cecil Rhodes variety. This is very much where Tony Blair and his
<br>
advisors are coming from.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        All in all I am asking you to expand and expound upon what you
</em><br>
mean.
<br>
<em>&gt; For example, I have no idea what you mean by the following sentence, &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence as to whether this is &quot;what the US government is thinking&quot; will
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt; become really clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after any way in Iraq.&quot;  Would you mind helping me with that sentence.
</em><br>
<p>Whoops! That is a typo (red face). I meant of course &quot;after any war in
<br>
Iraq&quot;.
