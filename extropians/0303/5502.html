</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite right.  It's as though they're professionals, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most of the rest of us are amateur partisans in comparison.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure where you're coming from.  You're saying normal people hate those
<br>
they disagree with, and politicians are playing this game and so are able to
<br>
be friendly?  That's not how I see it at all.  I'm sure Ted and Orrin are
<br>
pretty sincere in the beliefs we associate with them, and can be friends
<br>
because (1) they're mature (yes, I know I'm talking about Ted Kennedy) and (2)
<br>
they deal with each other every day.  And I view this as normal civilized
<br>
behavior, not a &quot;breed apart&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and you see new fascist organizations -- Le Pen, Haider,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; various neo-Nazis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Somehow, they seem pretty minor and tame to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But then, if I lived in Europe, perhaps my view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be different.
</em><br>
<p>The EU sure didn't think Haider was minor and tame.  Well, they are minor and
<br>
tame in what they've done, since they haven't gotten real power.  They sound
<br>
pretty scary though, and owe more to the old fascists than the liberals owe to
<br>
Lenin.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, that's not implausible.  Yet there is such a huge overlap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between leftist and liberal causes that one constantly notices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things they have in common.
</em><br>
<p>But not rightist and conservative causes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, that's what I meant.  These terms you're quoting are quite a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mixed bag.  &quot;Anti-patriotic&quot; is scarcely a meme.  &quot;Un-American&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Unpatriotic is a meme, I think.  &quot;Love it or leave it.&quot;  I'll agree these
<br>
aren't all-powerful tools of suppression, but then PC-ness isn't either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; up conservative, as I did, from 1960 to 1990, to feel the almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universal suppression in the media of conservative voices.
</em><br>
<p>I grew up with the McLaughlin Group.  The MacNeil-Lehrer New Hour... well, if
<br>
strong conservative voices were suppressed, so were strong liberal ones.
<br>
Really, what I associate with my memories of the mass media is blandness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Take me, for example.  I used to be pretty libertarian; I've been turning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leftwards economically, based on what I consider the evidence.  Leftward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaning social safety net, public funding of education and infrastructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and research, the usual mixed economy stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's actually shocking.  Do you think that you understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; key role of **incentives** in economics?  Do you appreciate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely key role historically of private property, and how
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Mixed economies have incentives and private properties.  I also
<br>
appreciate the roles of natural monopolies, externalities, human capital, lack
<br>
of fear of utter starvation, liquidity traps and Keynesianism, etc. etc.  Kind
<br>
of like any fabulously wealthy First World country in the world today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That sounds exactly right to me.  In fact, that's not entirely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the good, especially when it comes to &quot;keeping out the Other&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the Other is a foreign adversary (e.g. the Soviet Union or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam Hussein) bent on one's destruction.  You've articulated
</em><br>
<p>Well, Brin says &quot;we must go out and crush all those who do not believe in
<br>
tolerance and open-mindedness&quot;, or something close to that.
