<p>
This evening the British Government voted to support Tony Blair in his move 
<br>
towards military action.
<br>
<p>If it was never a deciding issue in the move to strike (and it probably 
<br>
wasn't), then either way the path is now clear for war in Iraq.
<br>
<p>This goes out to everyone here who has someone serving in the coalition 
<br>
forces, is near a danger zone or is under high alert of terrorist reaction.
<br>
<p>Here's hoping for a quick and relatively peaceful (in as much as war can 
<br>
be) conclusion to this conflict, with the swift and safe return of the 
<br>
servicemen and women of all coalition nations.  Here's hoping to the end of 
<br>
this regime, and a much improved future for the Iraqi people.  And here's 
<br>
hoping that the small chance of terrorist response on people living in a 
<br>
participating nation remains just that; a small, unfulfilled chance.
<br>
<p>And here's to the troops and their families, who must know by now that war 
<br>
is, in all likelihood, not much more than a day away.
<br>
<p>Stay safe out there.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>James...
<br>
&quot;If you can't take a little bloody nose, maybe you ought to go back home and
<br>
crawl under your bed. It's not safe out here. It's wondrous, with treasures
<br>
to satiate desires both subtle and gross. But it's not for the timid.&quot;
