<em>&gt; &gt; I suppose, for symmetry, the French won't be happy unless we give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the same 21 years to disarm that they gave Germany back then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, Germany only started to re-arm, and was a threat after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hitler's accession in 1933.  So the French gave peace a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance for 6 years, until Germany was stronger than France.
</em><br>
<p>I was counting from the end of the first world war and the end of the
<br>
first Gulf War. It can be argued that Saddam has been actively rearming
<br>
since 1998, i.e. 5 years ago, and making a serious effort ot hide it
<br>
all very well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The French would just let a bad situation get worse, playing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for time, hoping for some kind of rapprochement to develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a change in fortune, perhaps.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But why didn't they invade Germany in 1936 when Hitler
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seized the Rhineland, and he would have been incredibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easy to defeat?  Somehow he knew they wouldn't, and he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was right.
</em><br>
<p>Do you suppose, maybe, hint, hint, wink, wink, that Saddam, being an
<br>
avid Stalinist, is a good student of that era and recognised this
<br>
inherent weakenss in the French disposition, that they could be counted
<br>
on to do so again?
<br>
<p>I see that his ambassador to the UN has the gall to demand that &quot;now
<br>
that the requirements of the resolution have been met, that the embargo
<br>
and sanctions be ended&quot;.
<br>
<p>As I asked Neil Cavuto last night, I wonder how you say &quot;Vichy France&quot;
<br>
in arabic???
