<p><em>&gt; appearantly they feel that during the last war the US intentionally used

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the area where the depleted uranium weapons were used.
</em><br>
<p>Is there any actual data to support the claim that DU in the environment 
<br>
causes a measurable increase in cancers? In rats, monkeys *or* man? If so,
<br>
what are the numbers? What increase in cancer deaths at what dose, etc.?
<br>
<p>I believe that people could believe it.
<br>
<p>One factual predominant problem with DU is that it's a toxic metal.
<br>
It's conceivable to me that it, or its oxides or other compounds, could be 
<br>
carcinogenic the way (for instance) arsenides are, so I'm not prepared to 
<br>
utterly reject the notion out of hand.
<br>
<p>It's also perfectly plausible to me that there could be some other 
<br>
environmental factors to lay at the feet of any quantitative (not 
<br>
anecdotal) increase in cancers.
<br>
12 years isn't a typical timeline for fullblown cancers, IIRC; 20 to 30 is 
<br>
more like it. What was going on in that area back _then_?
<br>
<p>Surely someone like the FAS ought to be trying to get hard data on this,
<br>
and that ought to move one part (the factual part) of the dialogue forward.
<br>
<p>Of course, one could always claim that the DU used in Kuwait/Iraq was 
<br>
&quot;salted&quot; with short-lived nuclides. At which point one either needs hard 
<br>
samples, or a whistleblower who can document that, or one is stuck.
