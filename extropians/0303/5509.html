<em>&gt; &gt; In situations where people's views are well known and are also well

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no good to simply carry on with the same discussion.  My request is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aimed at both supporters and opponents of the war, and both to those
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; approve of it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, you're requesting that extropians with strong feelings about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the war should just shut up and stop debating the subject that matters most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to them at this key moment in history.
</em><br>
<p>For once, gts and I agree 8^D
<br>
<p>I did appreciate some of Greg's original remarks in this discussion
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0303/5424.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0303/5424.html</a>.
<br>
<p>In it, he asked us (using CAPITAL LETTERS) to tone down the
<br>
rhetoric.  ;-)
<br>
<p>But that was fine.  What did bother me was when he by his own
<br>
admission &quot;butted in&quot; to a discussion---a quite civil discussion
<br>
so far as I could see---where one poster was demanding that 
<br>
another one answer a certain question.
<br>
<p>Now I should confess that I have not been reading all the posts,
<br>
and am a day or two behind as it is.  But I don't really think
<br>
that anything so untoward has occurred, or is occurring, that
<br>
officers of Extropy must start asking people not to respond to
<br>
certain questions!
<br>
<p>gts goes on
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My friendly advice to you as your would-be political consultant (take it or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave it) is to let matters be.  If you don't want to read the messages on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extropian discussion list during this time of war then by all means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't. It's your choice.
</em><br>
<p>I really have wanted to start a discussion on how easy it is for
<br>
some people to just &quot;skip&quot; certain threads or posts.  It varies
<br>
a lot from person to person for purely technical reasons alone,
<br>
I have reason to believe!  But even so, I think that most of us
<br>
can avoid cat-fights when we see them coming---I know I certainly
<br>
do  (not that the current wrangles are in this category---as I say,
<br>
I have not really kept up with everything lately).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your apparent attempt to be controlling is, in my would-be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political consultant's view, despicable from an extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective.
</em><br>
<p>Gordon, I think that you are over-reacting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It could ultimately lead to your demise.
</em><br>
<p>WHAT now?  More threats??   I do so wish that everyone could just
<br>
state their opinions, respond to others' opinions in any way they'd
<br>
like, except stop trying to tell other people what to do.  And
<br>
certainly, certainly never threaten or warn anyone!  We've got
<br>
such a good thing going here---we should all just relax and enjoy.
<br>
<p>Lee
