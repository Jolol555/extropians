&quot;ANALYSIS: More enthusiasm than news in Fox's coverage of war&quot;
<br>
<a href="http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/local/3_22_03war_aaron.html">http://www.tucsoncitizen.com/local/3_22_03war_aaron.html</a>
<br>
<p>I've been flipping between FOX and CNN from day one of the war. I find this
<br>
reporter's observations to be true. 
<br>
<p>I agree especially with her comment that FOX &quot;appeals to a younger
<br>
audience.&quot; I get that impression all the time, from the language and
<br>
attitude of the reporters. Among other things, FOX reporters are more prone
<br>
to use inflammatory language. It's highly sensationalized news reporting.
<br>
Kinda' exciting, I would agree, but hardly unbiased! 
<br>
<p>CNN is boring by comparison, but in my view news SHOULD be boring. FOX seems
<br>
to think news is about entertainment rather than information. And this, no
<br>
doubt, is the reason FOX's ratings have climbed. Most people, especially
<br>
younger people, want to be entertained and excited whenever they turn on
<br>
their televisions. I noticed that because FOX has so little to offer in
<br>
terms of real war coverage from embedded reporters in the field, it tries
<br>
instead to entertain its audience with actors in the FOX studio dressed in
<br>
military uniforms. What's up with that?? The fake soldiers draw daggers and
<br>
point rifles at imaginary enemies, to the sound of dramatic war music. How
<br>
absurd! That's not news. That's blatant entertainment programming designed
<br>
to keep FOX's hawkish right-wing audience from turning the channel back to
<br>
CNN.
<br>
<p>FOX gives me an adrenaline rush, sometimes to the point where I can't stand
<br>
it anymore. I might have liked it back in the 80's, when I was a
<br>
20-something hard-line Reaganite who thought he had just &quot;seen the light&quot;...
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Rah Rah Rah! Go Reagan! Go Bush! Go GOP! Down with the liberals! Down with
<br>
our enemies! Down with the French and Germans and Russians! Down with the
<br>
peace-niks! And, above all, DOWN WITH SADDAM HUSSEIN! OFF WITH HIS
<br>
HEAD!!!&quot;... 
<br>
<p>That's the kind of zealotry that comes through between the lines from FOX. I
<br>
guess I'm getting old and maybe a little jaded. FOX-style reporting annoys
<br>
me.
<br>
<p>Only FOX news, with its hard-line right-wing audience, could get away with
<br>
having a war correspondent like Oliver North. The FOX audience no doubt
<br>
considers Oliver North a true patriot, and that he might be, but let's not
<br>
forget that he's also a convicted felon. I'm surprised they haven't also
<br>
hired G. Gordon Liddy of Watergate infamy. (Actually I'd bet dollars to
<br>
doughnuts that they've tried to hire him! Last I heard, Liddy had his own
<br>
radio show. He's already in the business of spewing anti-leftist hatred on
<br>
the airwaves, just not for FOX.)
<br>
<p>And there should be no disagreement that FOX's other war correspondent
<br>
Geraldo Rivera is a joke. 
<br>
<p>When it comes to news, especially international news, I just want the facts
<br>
conveyed to me in a non-emotional, intelligent, mature, matter-of-fact,
<br>
unbiased manner. I want to see the big picture from a *global* point of
<br>
view, not just from the pro-administration American point of view. I don't
<br>
want pizzazz and excitement and heated emotions. I just want the facts. CNN
<br>
isn't perfect, but in my view it meets the criteria above far better than
<br>
does FOX. I can watch CNN all day long without getting my shorts in a wad.
