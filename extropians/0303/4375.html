To which Charles Hixson responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;The first relevant link I found was:
<br>
<a href="http://www.chron.com/content/interactive/special/watergate/tapes.html">http://www.chron.com/content/interactive/special/watergate/tapes.html</a>
<br>
There were *many* pages of others.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would merely suggest that this page, much like most of the other &quot;serious&quot; 
<br>
news services, does its typical media best to sum up a complex issue in glib 
<br>
unhelpful fashion. Nowhere does it illustrate that Dean's testimony was full 
<br>
of contradictions that should have called into question his reliability as a 
<br>
witness. Nowhere does it illustrate that the &quot;impartial&quot; House and Senate 
<br>
bodies that took up the Watergate matter refused to include in their 
<br>
investigation previous elections and administrations, lest they give whatever 
<br>
Nixon's actions were the much needed historical perspective. Nowhere does it 
<br>
illustrate that Nixon fired Archibald Cox during the Yom Kippur War, fearing 
<br>
that Brezhnev might move Soviet troops into Israel and Egypt unilaterally (as 
<br>
he had said he would) if the Soviet General Secretary thought Nixon had lost 
<br>
control of his own government. It is high time that President Nixon's 
<br>
actions, both good and ill, were judged on their own merits and not on three 
<br>
decades old hysteria that does not hold up under scrutiny.
<br>
