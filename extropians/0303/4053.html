<em>&gt; &gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;### This is a very interesting line of thought that I have been recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;coming closer to. If the producer of a piece of information (be it music
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;knowledge embodied in a physical object) was really able to protect his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;property while allowing wide access to it, but without having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;state-enforced monopoly, this might be actually better than the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;situation. Persons unwilling to accept the terms set out by the owner
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;be free to compete by coming up with comparable information on their own,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;which would provide incentives to produce useful information, identical
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the incentives in the production of other commodities. Still, not knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;enough about technology, I wonder if it would be really possible to
</em><br>
protect
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;information ownership rights without some significant restrictions on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;devices used for the transmission and reading of information. How does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Palladium work?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the key question.  Palladium won't exist in a vacuum.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to work will depend on new and improved laws, e.g., laws making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it illegal to modify hardware to circumvent it.  And it will be largely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed by a company that has repeatedly shown a contempt for it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customers, ethics, and decency.  And that frequently lies about it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products, not only before release, but afterwards.  So it's going to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a new kind of state enforced monopoly, not get away from that concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Getting away from the concept would be worthy, but no state will give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up controls on any monopolies that exist.  The best you can hope for is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it might make it difficult to create new ones.  The state is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practically defined as an organization that claims a monopoly on the use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of force.)
</em><br>
\
<br>
### Exactly. See my response to Hal today.
<br>
-----------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I fully agree with the initial part of your analysis, since an
</em><br>
appropriately
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;managed patent and copyright system IMO indeed reduces transaction costs
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;allows the provision of useful goods which would otherwise not be
</em><br>
provided.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is correct, but the presumption &quot;...appropriately managed...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumes that those managing it have the same criteria as you do as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what this constitutes.  For some people the current US patent system is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;appropriately managed&quot;.  And those people are the ones in control of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the operation.
</em><br>
<p>### The free market - that's the solution. See my reply to Hal.
