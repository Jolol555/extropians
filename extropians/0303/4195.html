<em>&gt; Thank you Max,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        That was rather well put -- in fact you made the case so well that I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am going to have little left to say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        However I do want to draw attention to one phrase that Artillo used, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;if the international community fails to act firmly now against the UNITED 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; STATES, then the world will become a more dangerous place in years to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I call your attention to Artillio's calling for the international 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community &quot;to act firmly&quot; against the US.  He used the word firmly and I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect very strongly that he had something more in mind that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international community giving the US a stern stare or a stiff word or two.
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, Max's post was a good response, and I was happy to oblidge with a 
<br>
civilized response back. However, Ron, you have proved once again that you 
<br>
like to put words in people's mouths, even if it's only you &quot;suspect&quot;ing my 
<br>
meaning. See the response to Max's post for more information on just 
<br>
*exactly* what I mean regarding the post's actual subject matter.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;        All in all Artillio convinces me that he wishes to use force to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his way against the US.  Others have tried the same to their eventual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Artillio is even capable of arbitrating who should be on this list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who shouldn't.  I ask this question: if Artillio were the list master would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even be allowed to present my point of view?  Of course not, but that is my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion, you are free to form your own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>... ditto see above and previous posts.
<br>
<p>As for the comment about list control, see Extropian Principles 5, 6, and 7 
<br>
for my thoughts on THAT. :D
<br>
<p>I do sincerely apologize to Ron if my comments were a bit harsh (the bit 
<br>
about &quot;yellow journalism&quot; sources), that was an unfair assumption on my part.
<br>
<p>Peace and Happy Building,
<br>
<p>Artillo (spelled correctly!)
