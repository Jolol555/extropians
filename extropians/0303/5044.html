<p><em>&gt; By the way, if anybody still wants an &quot;Old&quot; European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Liberation Army to come over and liberate your people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the BUsh junta, I guess chances are good now.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few month ago I was the only one I knew who propagated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this proposal, but meanwhile, where 50.000 schoolboys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and schoolgirls gathered in Berlin on the first day of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war, I heard similar statements.  Makes me think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; young generation in Germany is on the right path.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, a lot of German schoolboys in the last century
<br>
conceived that a number of other countries needed 
<br>
liberating---and the fact that a large majority in
<br>
neighboring countries didn't agree, say 71% for example,
<br>
was not a factor.
<br>
<p>Sounds like the young generation might be on the same
<br>
failed path as last time around.  :-(   Fifty thousand,
<br>
eh?  Was it by any chance a torchlight get-together?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The US is the aggressor. They are PRODUCING all the situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we witness right now - or better the small part of images and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; news that pass censorship.  The axis of evil, Bush-Blair-Aznar,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and all those who are in the position to give orders must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; condemned in Den Haague to life imprisonment.  Of course the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same is true for Saddam and his own war criminal junta.
</em><br>
<p>Funny, that.  Then why no massing of the schoolboys to 
<br>
liberate the Iraqi people from *them*, ever?   Could it
<br>
possibly be, JUST POSSIBLY, that the U.S. is seen as a
<br>
superpower that needs cutting down to size, and that
<br>
this is the actual unconscious motivation?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many private and public aid organisations are trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to alleviate the misery that your abused and betrayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldiers have caused.  The biggest private German
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medicine organisation is on the way.
</em><br>
<p>Where were they when the tens of thousands of Iraqis
<br>
were being brutalized by that regime?  Selling goods
<br>
to the Iraq regime, I've heard say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I feel pity for these very young POWs shown on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TV.  Poor kids, probably thought they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invincible because they belong to God's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country.  Bullshit.  
</em><br>
<p>Now I know I'm right about your deep feeling of wanting
<br>
to cut the U.S. down to size.  I'm amazed that more
<br>
Europeans don't feel this same thing that you do.  A
<br>
huge part of European culture has had the built-in
<br>
assumption for centuries of their ruling over the rest
<br>
of the world, and so watching the US and USSR usurp that
<br>
role simply cannot have gone down easily for many.
<br>
<p>While I'm sure that I would feel the same way to a
<br>
small degree, I'd also be able to keep those feelings
<br>
very much in check, as in fact so many Europeans have
<br>
indeed shown they can do.
