<em>&gt; &gt; Alex independently, after pondering the question for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some time.  Communism doesn't work well unless the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whole planet is communist.  If one capitalist society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exists next to a communist, it prospers like crazy;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the go-getters in the commie society want to escape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to live with the rich capitalists.  Examples North
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and South Korea, East and West Berlin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Similarly, it seems to me that a libertarian society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; next to a totalitarian society is at a military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disadvantage, altho at a great advantage in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I would suggest a mostly libertarian society that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allows great personal and financial freedom but still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reserves the right to raise taxes for common defense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and even the right to draft citizens in a dire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; emergency.

<em>&gt;Well, hang on a second there. Socialist countries do badly compared to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;capitalist countries in a capitalist global system (as the 20th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socialists discovered to their chagrin). Socialists might fare better in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;socialist world system (say a socialist world government, perhaps? Something
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like the EU on steroids maybe :-). However, isolated capitalist countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;within a socialist world system might not fare so well.
</em><br>
<p>Which of Gorbachov's ministers was it who said that in the event of 
<br>
communist world conquest they'd leave New Zealand alone because they needed 
<br>
&quot;somewhere to get the prices from.&quot;  It seems to have been the 
<br>
understanding of the latter-day USSR that communism *couldn't* work without 
<br>
capitalist economies to draw basic economic information from.\
<br>
<p>Of course, socialism isn't as bad in this regard as communism, so they same 
<br>
considerations might not apply; or at least may apply in a less significant 
<br>
way, since though the prices in a socialist economy are distorted they do 
<br>
bear relation to reality.
<br>
<p>Any capitalist economy isolated in a socialist world would definitely 
<br>
suffer from less of world trade, so I think you could be right about that.
<br>
<p><p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
