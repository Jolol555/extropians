<p><em>&gt; Would you not see the Bush administration's decision to

<em>&gt; Government?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if it comes to that, then yes, the U.S./U.K. decision
<br>
to go it alone (i.e. with 19 or more other nations!) does
<br>
diminish the role of the U.N.  But it's not to imagined that
<br>
national sovereignty is to be in any way abandoned in the
<br>
foreseeable future.  No way.  Hence it's irrelevant for
<br>
&quot;World Government&quot;, a rather loony and hopeless idea, (unless
<br>
we are attacked by Vogons or something).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Seems to me to be a very substantial poke in the eye for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law, may even set it back 50 plus years.
</em><br>
<p>Would you consider the decision of the Clinton Administration
<br>
to go to war against Serbia without even CONSULTING the U.N.
<br>
or Russia to be a poke in the eye for international law?
<br>
Do you suppose that this did put international law back 50 years?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally I find it difficult to forget that it is the same Presidential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration that seems to be countenancing stepping away from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UN that is also trying so hard to ban embryonic stem cell research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wherever it can.  Maybe the coupling is irrelevant and coincidental.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I don't really see the connection.  A Clinton or Gore administration
<br>
might very well have done the same thing, but would have got a lot less
<br>
heat since Clinton was no &quot;cowboy&quot;, and he was from the liberal part of
<br>
the American political spectrum---yet a Clinton or Gore administration
<br>
might very well have endorsed embryonic stem cell research.
<br>
<p>The only consistency that you can expect from people is ideological
<br>
consistency.  But there is only a mild correlation between religiously
<br>
motivated Luddism and a sterner attitude towards threats to one's
<br>
nation.
