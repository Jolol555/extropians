Ron H noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Alex,
<br>
       I think you have just sat yourself upon a pedestal without 
<br>
justification.  
<br>
       First, let me dispose of a minor personal matter.  You dare ask me 
<br>
what I think of the American Indian Movement.  If you listened at all you 
<br>
would know I am a part blood Cherokee.  The other questions you asked are 
<br>
almost as insulting.
<br>
       Second, if you were really interested in dealing with trolls you would 
<br>
<p>ask Natasha or her designee to check the various threads you object to see 
<br>
who initiates them.  I don't think any of the people that I ordinarily agree 
<br>
with ever initiate a single political or off topic thread -- I know I don't.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>Yah! Mr. Bokov was the fellow, I believe, who initiated the Bulldozer-Israel 
<br>
thread, last weekend. Its rhetorical to ask whom is the polemicist here.  As 
<br>
far as Extropian v stealth conservative, (another polemical thread here) he 
<br>
seems to be attempting to run a litmus-test for the ideologically correct. Is 
<br>
there now an Ideologically correct hoop to jump through?
<br>
<p>Lets go to some of the inspiring minds behind the Extropian technological 
<br>
philosophy. Would Marvin Minsky, Hans Moravec, K. Eric Drexler, Kurzweil, 
<br>
Vinge, Tipler, as well as so many others who are, at least transhumanist in 
<br>
outlook. Do they now have to pass muster for approval amongst the &quot;holy&quot;?  My 
<br>
guess is such people will be all over the place politically. The great salad 
<br>
bar of politics and the choices we make are available for our choosing. 
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the more one attempts to convert this mailing list into an 
<br>
exclusionary group, the more it will seem unattractive to those not in it 
<br>
yet. Especially, if one has to pass the initiation rites, and swear 
<br>
alliegence to the high mucky muck of such a stated group. Such a philosophy 
<br>
will surely exclude most engineers of all stripes, who, sorry to warn you, 
<br>
are generally very politically conservative. As far as physicists go, even 
<br>
when, for example, the Nuclear Winter scenario was touted by Kosta Tsipis, 
<br>
Garwin, and Carl Sagan; it was Freeman Dyson ( no slouch in the pro govt 
<br>
support of the poor viewpoint) who suggested: well surely not a Nuke winter, 
<br>
perhaps a nuke autimn?  We cannot relegate people to ideological 
<br>
correctness--ain't gonna happen.
<br>
