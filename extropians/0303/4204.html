<em>&gt;According to my librarian wife, the Fed's have *always* been able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;snoop into your reading habits...the threshold is just a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lower, but this is nothing new.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;For this reason, indeed, the vast majority of libraries *do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;keep* historical records. Once you return a book, there is no record
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of you ever having had it (a small exception may be rare book
</em><br>
<em>&gt;collections). They have done this for a very long time, purely to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protect your privacy, since historical records would be useful in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some situations. But American librarians take intellectual freedom
</em><br>
<em>&gt;very seriously.
</em><br>
<p>Steve, do you (more: your wife) know how the Feds plan implement this
<br>
provision of the Patriot Act, then? If the librarians regularly
<br>
destroy the borrowing records, then this provision seems rather empty.
<br>
<p>[to Spike: Generally I think it's none of the government's business
<br>
what I like to read, ingest, listen to, play with, travel to, spend
<br>
my money on, spend my time with, keep on my hard disk, and so on.
<br>
As time passes, it looks to me like it is easier, not hardier to
<br>
form a dossier on anyone that they want for the sparsest of reasons.
<br>
The direction that the 'War on Terrorism' is following seems to be
<br>
a carbon copy of the 'War on Drugs', but with the amplification factor
<br>
cranked up a few orders of magnitude. Assumed Guilty, the individual
<br>
must prove their Innocence. This is  not the kind of political climate
<br>
that supports intelligent people.]

<p>[...]
<br>
&quot;Section 215 of the act allows FBI agents to obtain a warrant from a
<br>
secret federal court for library or bookstore records of anyone
<br>
connected to an investigation of international terrorism or spying.
<br>
<p>Unlike conventional search warrants, there is no need for agents to
<br>
show that the target is suspected of a crime or possesses evidence
<br>
of a crime. As the Santa Cruz signs indicate, the law prohibits
<br>
libraries and bookstores from telling their patrons, or anyone else,
<br>
that the FBI has sought the records.
<br>
<p>The provision was virtually unnoticed when the Patriot Act, a major
<br>
expansion of government search and surveillance authority, was
<br>
passed by Congress six weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But
<br>
in the last year, Section 215 has roused organizations of librarians
<br>
and booksellers into a burst of political activity, and is being
<br>
cited increasingly by critics as an example of the new law's
<br>
intrusiveness. &quot;
