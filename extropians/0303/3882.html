Mike Lorrey shared:
<br>
&lt;&lt;She spent over a month in the ICU, all of it sedated and with her
<br>
incision wide open due to swelling preventing it from being sewed shut.
<br>
She has been in the Vascular Surgery ward under 24 hour nursing care
<br>
for the last month and is concious, but with a tracheotomy, a tube
<br>
through the nose and four into her abdomen for draining fluid while she
<br>
continues to heal.
<br>
<p>I am frankly quite shocked that surgeons today are still relying on
<br>
plain old sutures to close abdominal incisions&gt;&gt;.
<br>
<p>Indeed! What seems to be needed is advances in tissue engineering. 
<br>
Interestingly enough, there is a short article in the 3-5-2003 in Yahoo, 
<br>
Health, wednesday which is an attempt to use stem cells to accomplish this.

<br>
<p><p>By Keith Mulvihill NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Michigan doctors are hoping 
<br>
that their first-of-a-kind stem cell treatment will help a teenage boy regain 
<br>
lost heart tissue after he was shot in the heart by a nail gun and 
<br>
subsequently suffered a massive heart attack. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    
<br>
The experimental procedure used stem cells harvested from the boy's own 
<br>
blood, which were later infused into the damaged portion of his heart via a 
<br>
catheter. A team of doctors gathered Wednesday and announced the preliminary 
<br>
results of the procedure at a news conference at Beaumont Hospital in Royal 
<br>
Oak. In the stem cell procedure, which was performed February 21, the boy was 
<br>
initially given a drug that helps stimulate the production of stem cells in 
<br>
the blood. Stem cells were then harvested and concentrated from the boy's 
<br>
blood and the solution was infused directly into the damaged artery, 
<br>
explained Dr. Steven Timmis, one of the cardiologists overseeing the boy's 
<br>
care. The aim of the procedure is to stimulate blood vessel and heart muscle 
<br>
growth in areas of the heart without sufficient blood supply, Timmis said in 
<br>
a telephone interview. Stem cells are so-called master cells that can develop 
<br>
into various tissues in the body and using them to repair damaged hearts is a 
<br>
hot area of medical research. People who survive a major attack are often 
<br>
left with damaged heart muscle, which reduces the heart's pumping capacity 
<br>
and can result in progressive heart failure. &gt;&gt; 
<br>
<p>This  above needs to work, or something like it!
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I recall a bit from a Niven story (I think called &quot;Veil of Anarchy&quot;)
<br>
about a fellow who had a digital watch implanted beneath his skin &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Funny, what item I remember best about that novella, was the naked redhead 
<br>
female, wearing the long floating black cape. :-)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Lastly, I am perturbed at what is considered acceptable nursing care
<br>
today. She is at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, which is
<br>
considered a top notch facility, and the neglect and bad attitude of
<br>
many of the nurses has annoyed us to no end. I pity those who have to
<br>
stay at lower quality institutions. As Doctor MacCoy would say, &quot;This
<br>
is barbaric!&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This is where robots would come in handy, for all aspects of living, coping, 
<br>
and recovery. I bet its technically doable, now the economics?
