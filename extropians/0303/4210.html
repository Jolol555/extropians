In a message dated 3/12/2003 7:41:35 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:naddy@mips.inka.de?Subject=Re:%20iraq:%20%20possibly%20wishful%20thinking">naddy@mips.inka.de</a> writes: A more reasonable tactic might be to wait for an 
<br>
actual US invasion and then surrender as quickly as possible.  How practical 
<br>
this is depends on the details of the US attack.  You can't surrender to a 
<br>
B-52.  Which raises the interesting question whether the US wants to capture 
<br>
the Iraqi soldiers or prefers to kill as many as possible by air attack.
<br>
<p>Naddy,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The military is reporting via the news media that they are in contact 
<br>
with the Iraqe military news and are making arrangements for Iraqi units that 
<br>
do not with to fight to declare their neutrality.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition the psych warfare boys have been in contact with the Iraqi 
<br>
brass for sometime now arranging for their surrender where the brass doesn't 
<br>
want to fight.  It is said this is going on via the internet.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They say they hope to capture Iraqi units in their entirety and while 
<br>
holding them out of combat put them to work on the infrastructure of the 
<br>
country where volunteers for wages are available.  It is said that the oil 
<br>
revenues of the country are sufficient to pay for Iraq's rebuilding if the 
<br>
funds are switched from weapons procurement to rebuilding and feeding the 
<br>
populace.  However we will have to prime the pump in the time between 
<br>
liberation and the cash flow coming in.
