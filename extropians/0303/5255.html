Gts stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;By the way, I sent a message a couple of hours ago in which I stated that 
<br>
in
<br>
my opinion FOX News is a news network designed by and for morons. I hope you
<br>
don't think I was referring specifically to you. I just have some pretty
<br>
strong feelings about this subject. I think bias in the media should be
<br>
investigated and exposed.
<br>
-gts&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>People will own their own opinions on who is a moron or not. Most often, 
<br>
complicated issues makes morons of us all; yet we take our stand and do the 
<br>
best we can. Tangentially, it has been cited in a psychological study of 
<br>
expertise (Harvard?), that most of those people who think they are brilliant, 
<br>
ain't. Conversely, many of those who are more cautious in their self-esteem, 
<br>
tended to be apptituidnally, sharper. I like Fox as a determined 
<br>
counter-balance to the &quot;major networks&quot; and CNN which I have monitored to 
<br>
frequently have a Liberal-Bias on foreign policy. FoxNews has a 
<br>
Conservative-Rightist bias on foreign policy, and it is there that I find 
<br>
myself most in tune with. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I was a subscriber to the National Review for a long time, and still read 
<br>
it
<br>
when I have the opportunity. I have a great deal of respect for William F.
<br>
Buckley. He seems to understand the important distinction between freedom
<br>
politics and GOP politics. For example he breaks with the GOP in his
<br>
opposition to the War on Drugs.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Buckley is cool, and this is someone who in the recent past, disdained the 
<br>
man completely. The writers of National Review are among the best 
<br>
editorialists, I have ever read. A close second, for punditry, would be the 
<br>
Weekly Standard, for clairity of analysis. The war on drugs is a spasmodic 
<br>
and cynical reaction for control, which my former philosphy professor, of 
<br>
many years ago; stated that is what all people want. I have yet to disagree 
<br>
with him on that matter. He was a big follower of Sarte, whom I still find, 
<br>
ungraspable.
<br>
<p>I see the need for advocacy journalism, is a world of news reportage' that 
<br>
has such a short memory, and never seems to wish to act on behalf of American 
<br>
interests.
