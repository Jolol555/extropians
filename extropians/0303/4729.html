<br>
mention the many stealth left wingers on her?  How                            
<br>
<p><p>My bad. Search their archives, same tactic will flush them out too. I
<br>
guess disagreeing with them comes naturally, and I rarely even notice them
<br>
anymore. Disagreeing with you guys feels wierd and annoying. Hopefully, by the
<br>
end of this month my pledge will have helped me get over this hangup, and I
<br>
will gain equal facility in ignoring both types of trolls.

<br>
do you distinguish a stealth-conservative from a libertarian?                 
<br>
<p><p>Ah! Good question. I've been kicking it around for a while. Let's see if I can
<br>
answer it without breaking my pledge (see start of this thread). How many of
<br>
the following organizations do you find distasteful out of all proportion to
<br>
any specific arguments you put forward to justify your distaste:
<br>
<p>ACLU (IMHO this one is the strongest bellwhether of what you really are)      
<br>
Amensty International                                                         
<br>
Planned Parenthood                                                            
<br>
Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation                                   
<br>
NAACP                                                                         
<br>
American Indian Movement                                                      
<br>
Women's Health Action Mobilization                                            
<br>
National Organization for Women                                               
<br>
<p>The more of them tick you off for, the more you fit into the former
<br>
category. If you are indifferent to all of them, or even agree with many
<br>
of them on bits and pieces of their agendae, that places you in the latter
<br>
category. Obviously, only you know for sure... hopefully we're all at least
<br>
honest with ourselves.
<br>
<p>Other people can only INFER which end of the spectrum you fall on. Although
<br>
the more emotional and dogmatic you sound, the less Extropian you are
<br>
automatically, regardless of what kind of non-Extropian you are.

How do I                                                                      
<br>
distinguish you from a person that does not believe in free speech?           
<br>
<p><p>Dunno. Good one. Let me know if you come up with a good heuristic. One
<br>
that comes to mind is the fact that I want to ignore trolls with greater
<br>
efficiency rather than call for their banning, suing, fining, jailing,
<br>
flogging, etc. Also, this medium isn't terribly conducive to someone who
<br>
doesn't believe in free speech, don't you think?
