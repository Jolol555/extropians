</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; bother writing them out here, but the point is, I could. One thing - my

</em><br>
<em>&gt; my conscious mind breaking through. Incredible!
</em><br>
<p>I've had Lucid Dreaming experiences as far back as I can remember, without 
<br>
having had to study or train. Most of the time when I am asleep I know that I 
<br>
am dreaming. I very seldom try to influence the dream, because I always find 
<br>
that there is a sort of inertia or counter-force at work.  For example, I 
<br>
might decide to walk through a brick wall, rather than continue trying to 
<br>
find a way over it.  When I succeed (with difficulty) I'll find that whats on 
<br>
the other side has radically changed...
<br>
<p>As I get older I've found that this counter-force is getting weaker, or that 
<br>
I'm getting better at controlling it, or something. I've always thought of it 
<br>
as the unconcious story-teller who's upset at me messing with the narative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; i.e. I simply ask myself: &quot;Is this a dream?&quot; and then I glance at my hands for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a few seconds for any signs of &quot;weirdness&quot;. Then I look at my watch, look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away, and look back again to see if the numerals remain consistent and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logical. Another quick glance around at my surroundings, and then it's back to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever I was doing before. Apparently when this has become completely second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature, I can expect that I'll do it while engaged in an actual dream. At that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point, it will supposedly be able to realize that I'm dreaming. Then I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either begin to exert control over the path of the dream, or simply go with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the flow.
</em><br>
<p>I have long since banished all watches from my dreamscape, since at some 
<br>
point I noticed that EVERY time I looked at a watch in my dreams, its message 
<br>
was 'Wake up, you're late for work!&quot;  At which point I would, in a panic, 
<br>
force myself to wake up.  Do that enough times at 3:00 am, and it becomes a 
<br>
problem.
