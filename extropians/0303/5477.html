<p><em>&gt; What if

</em><br>
<p>Are you including the US in those countries? I think you know as well as I
<br>
do that post-war Iraq is going to be a friendly trade-partner of the USA.
<br>
That is, after all, the greatest objective of this war -- to remove a
<br>
hostile regime. We want to make Iraq into a friendly banana-republic that
<br>
grows oil instead of bananas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have also heard it said that the Iraqi oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drilling and transportation system is antiquated.  As a result it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested that a post war Iraq oil supply system that was brought up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to modern standards could triple the amount of oil they have sold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the past ten years. 
</em><br>
<p>And I would agree if you think this is a good thing. I also think &quot;more and
<br>
cheaper oil&quot; must be on the minds of the powers that be. Hubert mania is not
<br>
wrong to make this observation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am sure many people can foresee the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible changes in the oil market far better than I can so I need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a much more specific statement of what you had in mind.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you're asking for. 
<br>
<p>Some famous person once said &quot;War is capitalism with its gloves off.&quot; I
<br>
think that idea has some relevance here.
<br>
<p>Behind all the rhetoric about our &quot;liberation&quot; of &quot;oppressed people&quot; of
<br>
&quot;Axis of Evil&quot; countries there are some fundamental economic forces at work.
<br>
It's too bad that most American capitalists and politicians are afraid to
<br>
admit it in public; our denial of this element only makes us look dishonest
<br>
to educated people in other countries who know better. 
<br>
<p>Now that we're in this war up to our eye-brows, with no turning back, I
<br>
think we should stop hiding behind our moral self-righteousness as
<br>
&quot;liberators of the oppressed&quot; and start trumpeting the future economic
<br>
benefits of this war. The US is not the only country that stands to gain.
