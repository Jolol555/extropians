George Soros in his book Open Society proposes that humans are fallible
<br>
and that nobody holds the absolute truth. In all human interactions
<br>
(politics, economics - as opposed to hard science like physics) there
<br>
can only be approximations of what is the true answer. Some ideas are
<br>
generally agreed upon to be more &quot;fit&quot; but in general there is no one
<br>
answer.
<br>
<p>In my life I take viewpoints, but try not to cling to them too strongly.
<br>
Those who are completely sure of their answer are in my eyes part of the
<br>
problem. I do not think war is the best solution, but I cannot be sure
<br>
it is wrong. I am fallible, I am humble. 
<br>
<p>Those who are so sure of something are extremists, they tend to cause
<br>
problems. Often there is a small group of 5 to 10% that are so sure of
<br>
something they try to run it through independent of what the majority
<br>
wants. 
<br>
<p>There are a small group of people who do not think Israel should exist,
<br>
as there are a small group that thinks that Israel should expand. There
<br>
are a small group who think that abortion is like murder, and there are
<br>
a small group who think it means nothing. There are some who think war
<br>
should never be fought, there are those that want to rule with an iron
<br>
fist of death. People on the extremes often screw up things for the rest
<br>
of the world.
<br>
<p>Personally I think if moderates ran everything and extremists were held
<br>
to minimal participation, the world would be a MUCH better place. Yet a
<br>
dillemma is that extremists are aften very motivated to make a
<br>
difference, and moderates tend to be somewhat unmotivated.
<br>
<p>Perhaps there is a way to set up a discussion system online that gives
<br>
more credence to moderation. Of course George Soros has many ideas on
<br>
this - an open society that accepts many different ideas.
<br>
<p>Maybe competition does increase progress, but I think today, in 2003,
<br>
the world has so much momentum for progress, that we do not really need
<br>
much more competition. There are so many groups in the world that know
<br>
they are right and have access to more weapons, that we must think hard
<br>
how we can all get together.
<br>
<p>Lastly, people who get bent out of shape over politics are pretty funny
<br>
to look at - they get the veins bulging on their red foreheads and their
<br>
eyes bulge out too......

Subject: Friends or Enemies
<br>
<p><p><p>Is it neccesary for two people with opposing views to become enemies in 
<br>
order to resolve the subject with which they oppose? Does the creation
<br>
of 
<br>
enemies lead to futher competition and therefore increase progress? Or
<br>
does the creation of enemies cause more irrational thought and thereby 
<br>
decrease progress? What would be the best relationship for resolving 
<br>
opposing opinions?
<br>
<p>What systems offer an intermediate relationship so that people are
<br>
impelled 
<br>
to challenge each other yet has check points so that people do not
<br>
become 
<br>
overly irrational?
<br>
<p>I would say that this email list is one such system. In the real world 
<br>
though, what systems are setup?
