<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yet in all the cases I can think of from 1878 on, European powers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ruled over others' lands for the primary purpose of enriching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; themselves (i.e. economic advance), or for military gain (e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the conquest of the Turkish possessions).  I would be willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; admit that a secondary consideration might be the welfare of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ruled, at least after, as you suggest, 1878.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not so.  You have to make a distinction between practice and justificatory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory (as I did en passant) and also between practice and motive. In other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words there is both Empire (the institutional/policy reality) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Imperialism (the ideology that justifies the policy and inspires it).
</em><br>
<p>Splendid.  You contrast the reality of what finally
<br>
obtains vs. the ideology that inspired it. All right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is simply not true that Europeans and people of European origin such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans ruled over others for reasons of material gain.  This was a motive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the earlier phase of Empire in the 18th to early 19th century but is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainly absent in the post 1878 period.  Colonial empires lose money big time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (contrary to the Hobson//Lenin view) there is not a substantial group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gains economically at others' expense.
</em><br>
<p>There are of course, exceptions.  King Leopold's rule over
<br>
the Congo up till when? maybe 1920? seemed to have no goal
<br>
but to extract the maximum amount of rubber with the least
<br>
trouble.  But I'll defer to your more global claim in
<br>
general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The main motives, as spelt out by the advocates of Empire are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) Glory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (b) national power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (c) the 'uplifting', 'civilising mission' as the French call it.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; This last is very important for the great colonial administrators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as Cromer, Lyautey, and Lugard.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  So we turn now to the current event:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [The main motive of the present Iraqi excursion is]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to realise a set of values and to ensure American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safety and predominance by doing this.
</em><br>
<p>Seems to fit.  The Americans are sincere in wanting to
<br>
remove WMD from tyrannical regimes hating the U.S., and
<br>
would probably want to do that anywhere they had the
<br>
strength to, and secondly, maintaining or extending
<br>
world predominance is hardly going to be seen as an
<br>
unfortunate side-effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Then the irony is, the more effort that is made on behalf of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Iraqi people, then the more imperialistic the U.S. role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will become!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...to establish a non-authoritarian or less repressive regime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in Iraq would require an extended stay by the Coalition (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at least U.S.) forces.  But the longer the stay, the more this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a case of liberal imperialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is exactly right. As you say paradoxical. BTW the 'beneficiaries' of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the is policy are likely to resent it, even if they do actually benefit.
</em><br>
<p>Well, putting aside for the moment the real motivations behind the 
<br>
U.S./U.K., one then wonders what course would indeed in fact benefit
<br>
the Iraqis the most (or hurt them the least).  Ramez Naam on this
<br>
list, and perhaps one other person from the Middle East, has weighed
<br>
in heavily to suggest that the U.S. stay for a very long time.
<br>
Evidently his intuition is that Iraq could become democratic, were
<br>
the occupying power sufficiently idealistic and willing to pay what
<br>
ever is required to achieve that goal.
<br>
<p>Yet many others demur, including you, from studying the remainder
<br>
of your post, where you write
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if the US adopts a minimal approach of removing WMDs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Baathists, replacing them with clients (a Hashemite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; King perhaps?) and then withdrawing most of its military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presence, and doesn't try to actually administer or set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policy for post Saddam Iraq, then Empire has got the thumbs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down.
</em><br>
<p>So I infer that in this case you're opposed to liberal
<br>
imperialism because it won't work.  You seem to believe
<br>
that this particular Arabic country at this particular
<br>
time cannot be other than it is; basically, a backward
<br>
nation mixing ancient and modern, which will be ruled
<br>
by someone with an iron hand for a long time to come.
<br>
<p>Is that the only reason you're opposed to the current
<br>
U.S./U.K. plans?
<br>
<p>Lee
