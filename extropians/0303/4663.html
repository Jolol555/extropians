<p>
Great article here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/callahan/callahan105.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/callahan/callahan105.html</a>
<br>
<p>I liked this part:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I saw a TV report that one UK official claimed that if not for 
<br>
France's intransigence, war could have been prevented. So, it's not the 
<br>
countries that are advocating war and massing troops around Iraq that 
<br>
are responsible, it's a country resisting the push to war. I suppose 
<br>
that makes sense: Imagine three men who have met a woman alone in a dark 
<br>
alley. Two of them threaten to rape her, but one refuses to cooperate. 
<br>
The two aggressors tell the third man, &quot;It's your fault that we have to 
<br>
rape her. If only we had presented a united front, she would have given 
<br>
up hope and submitted voluntarily.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Which reminds me of this:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Next, they saw a city of 550,000 men, women and children, and in an 
<br>
instant the city vanished; shadows remained where the men were gone, a 
<br>
firestorm raged, burning pimps and infants and an old statue of a happy 
<br>
Buddha and mice and dogs and old men and lovers; and a mushroom cloud 
<br>
arose above it all. This was a world created by the cruelest of all 
<br>
gods, Realpolitik.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is Discord,&quot; said Apollo, disturbed, laying down his lute.
<br>
<p>Harry Truman, a servant of Realpolitik, wearing the face of Oliver 
<br>
Hardy, looked upon his work and saw that it was good. But beside him, 
<br>
Albert Einstein, a servant of that most elusive and gnomic of gods, 
<br>
Truth, burst into tears, the familiar tears of Stanley Laurel facing the 
<br>
consequences of his own karma. For a brief instant, Truman was troubled, 
<br>
but then he remembered the eternal words: &quot;Now look what you made me 
<br>
do,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>And that was the third Vision.&gt;&gt;

<br>
<p>&quot;Now look what you made me do&quot; is what I say to myself whenever war gets 
<br>
blamed on peaceniks, appeasers, pacifists, etc.
