<p><em>&gt; As Robert Bradbury pointed out, leaving Saddam in power will cause more

</em><br>
<p>Actually Michael I did receive a couple of offlist posts questioning
<br>
(validly I think) some of my assumptions.  The most significant of
<br>
which (IMO) is the question of whether the U.S./U.K./Au will have
<br>
to completely eliminate the Republican Guard (probably 100K+ individuals,
<br>
similar to the casulties in Gulf War I) in order to take out Saddam
<br>
and the ~100 top level individuals that constitute his &quot;regime&quot;.
<br>
Such costs (from an extropic perspective) make special ops and
<br>
assinations seem &quot;reasonable&quot; were it not for the knowledge we
<br>
have of how often these create more problems than they solve.
<br>
<p>If that turns out to be necessary then my calculations may be
<br>
somewhat more questionable from a utilitarian perspective.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We do not support war because we like to see people die, or get our jollies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off of watching bombs fall in Iraq, and until you understand the reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *why* those of us who actually support this effort support it, and address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those points, your comments will not persuade anyone.
</em><br>
<p>I think this the key point that Hubert, Max and others need to understand.
<br>
I refused to return my draft card during the Vietnam war until my father
<br>
(who had served in WWII) made it clear he would throw me out of the house
<br>
if I did not do so.  I am *NOT* a &quot;fan&quot; of war.  *But* I am very aware
<br>
(much more aware than most people on the list) of how the technologies
<br>
for developing/producing WMD are becoming increasingly available to
<br>
both rogue nation-states as well as terrorist organizations.
<br>
<p>People who promote &quot;peace at all costs&quot; simply do not recognize
<br>
that these technologies have the capacity for eliminating civilization
<br>
as we know it (note my recent posts on SARS -- and that is probably
<br>
a natural situation).
<br>
<p>I'll make an assertion to people who object to my position (or the
<br>
activities of the U.S./U.K./Au) -- *you* are *clueless* with respect
<br>
to how bad it could get and how close people who have virtually
<br>
no respect for &quot;human dignity&quot; are to bridging the gap to the point
<br>
where they are executing your worst nightmare.  How long do you need
<br>
to watch Al-Jazeera before you figure out that they are promoting
<br>
the &quot;unextropic&quot; concept that they want you (&quot;us&quot;) dead?
<br>
<p>And thank you Michael for detailing points that need to responded
<br>
to (i.e. the rationale behind a pro-war position) much better than
<br>
I might have done.
<br>
<p>Robert
