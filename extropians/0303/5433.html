<em>&gt; Okay, Mr. Dickey, one more time:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The United States can be the greatest power in the World. I do not mind at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.
</em><br>
<p>Note you said in your previous post
<br>
<p>&quot;But what I fear is that this war might be the first step towards a new
<br>
world order where the law of the strongest, i. e. USA reigns.&quot;
<br>
<p>Correct me if I am wrong, but that seems to contradict your statement in
<br>
this post, that you 'do not mind at all'
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what I FEAR is one war after the other on countries that seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpopular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the US.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting...  So, hypothetically speaking, would you support this (and
<br>
only this effort in particular) if you knew that the US would persue no
<br>
other regimes in the 'axis of evil'?
<br>
<p>Your statement seems to say to me &quot;I object to this war, because the US may
<br>
start others&quot;
<br>
<p>What I want to know is, what are your feelings on *this war* in particular,
<br>
ignoring what you think the US might or might not do in the future.  That
<br>
is, given the established existing scenerio (res 1441, the lack of
<br>
co-operation with inspectors, 'serious consequences', and the requirement to
<br>
present a credible threat of force to enforce UN 'international law' and
<br>
inspectors, and the conservative estimate of 200,000 deaths from Saddam) Do
<br>
you consider the effort to remove Saddam Hussain, as a despotic dictator,
<br>
from power a morally just one?
<br>
<p>Note, in a previous series of posts, we had this discussion (trying to
<br>
accurately cut/paste/summarize without distorting stances)
<br>
<p>Mania: &quot;You[r] political leaders are way beyond simple paranoia. They are
<br>
inhuman future war criminals.&quot;
<br>
<p>Me:&quot;If they were 'War Criminals' I wonder what you would propose doing about
<br>
it...Should an international coalition be formed to remove him from power,
<br>
or demand he be removed?  Perhaps the UN could present a resolution
<br>
declaring that he must lose his capability to attack other nations by some
<br>
certain deadline, and if he does not by that deadline members of that
<br>
coalition can remove his capability by force if necessary.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mania: &quot;Yes, of course, what else? Remove him from power...The WHOLE
<br>
administration of course that is responsible for the Iraq war.  For every
<br>
single dead child Bush should be sentenced to livelong prison...I know what
<br>
you are trying to say. No nation or organisation is powerful enough to
<br>
remove an American President from power...If you are a true patriot, you
<br>
must stop these imbeciles from bringing war to one country after another
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey said:&quot;Apparently, Mr. Mania, you have no sense of irony. The
<br>
respondent was using acts that Saddam has committed, and which you and your
<br>
country seem blithely unwilling to bring him to task on. The fact that you
<br>
are
<br>
so willing to remove Mr. Bush for acts which Mr. Saddam has committed, and
<br>
not willing to remove Mr. Saddam, exposes your hypocrisy and hidden
<br>
agenda....&quot;
<br>
<p>Mania: &quot;Yes, you are right, I failed to see the irony here. But anyway, your
<br>
fine President will be responsible for the deaths of American soldiers and
<br>
for invading a country. So, the reasons for accusation remain just the same,
<br>
no matter if I failed to detect ironic statements or not.&quot;
<br>
<p>Me: &quot;So you now recognize the irony, but do nothing to answer the question?
<br>
Why would you support a move, unilitarerally or multilaterally, to depose
<br>
Bush as a war criminal but CALL Bush a war criminal for trying to do exactly
<br>
that with Saddam, who IS in fact a war criminal.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mania: &quot;Allright. I give up. No more communication possible. A complete
<br>
waste of time and energy.  The falcons on this list live in a giant bubble
<br>
and don`t even realize that they are isolated in the world. You are lost, my
<br>
un-friends!&quot;
<br>
<p>In short, you acknowledge that had Bush done what Saddam did, an
<br>
international coalition would be justified in removing Bush.  But when
<br>
pointed out to you that you do not support the ousting of Saddam for doing
<br>
this, and in fact claim Bush to be a War Criminal for doing what you
<br>
consider just to do to Bush, you merely 'give up' claiming 'no more
<br>
communication possible'
<br>
<p>So, whats the deal, is it morally just to remove Saddam, but your primary
<br>
reluctance is that if you support it, you might indirectly give creedence to
<br>
further US aggresions which you definately will not support?
<br>
<p>This particular concern of yours seems more evident when I go through older
<br>
posts.  It seems though, to be a fallacy of extremes, or the slippery slope.
<br>
e.g. &quot;If we let this war slide, well let every war slide&quot;  I wonder what,
<br>
intrinsically, you consider the moral validity of *this war* to be, and why?
<br>
When you acknowledge that War Criminals can be removed by force from
<br>
international coalitions (presumably without 'international law', given that
<br>
in your example the US, with Veto power, would surely Veto any UN security
<br>
council resolution calling for the ousting of the US government)  But
<br>
consider the attempt to remove Saddam for those crimes (and many others) as
<br>
unjust, its just a bit confusing.  All of these things lead members of this
<br>
list (at least myself for sure) to suspect you merely dont like the US,
<br>
since every single thing you endorse supports this conclusion.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
