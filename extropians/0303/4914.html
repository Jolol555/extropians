<em>&gt; &gt; On a similar note, I hear lots of europeans and others claim they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; love Americans but hate our government's policy. Turns out that 71%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; currently support Bush's policy and 78% think the UN is a failure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No argument on your first point. I assume these are figures of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American views? From my vantage point the figures here are very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different. I will add that my personal view on the UN. I cannot see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how it can be viewed as 'a Failure' simply because it didn't allow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US and UK to act as they pleased or simply disagreed with them.
</em><br>
<p>The UN failed because it failed to act in the best interests of the
<br>
Iraqi people. It failed because, just like the League of Nations,
<br>
allowed fascist states to continue to oppress their subject people with
<br>
the help of states that found commercial profit in propping up such
<br>
fascists. It failed because it failed to present a united front against
<br>
tyranny and the proliferation of WMD among fascist states. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The UN is after all a democratic group that collectively make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions based on each member states own wants and needs. 
</em><br>
<p>The UN is NOT a democratic group. I know of absolutely no nation where
<br>
the national representative to the UN is elected by the people. In the
<br>
best case, some nations, like the US, approve such representatives in
<br>
one or more legistlative bodies of popularly elected representatives.
<br>
Most Ambassadors to the UN are not so selected and screened. Most are
<br>
either members of the party in power, or have bought to position, or
<br>
else are relatives or other cronies of the ruling thug of their nation.
<br>
<p>The Security Council is even less democratic. It has permanent members
<br>
whose membership exists solely because they were the primary members of
<br>
the victorious side of WWII. They can veto anything they want to. The
<br>
temporary members of the Security Council are not elected to their
<br>
positions either.
<br>
<p>To claim the UN is democratic is about as accurate as claiming that the
<br>
Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council or the Palestinian Authority is
<br>
democratic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will say that the UN does appear to be ineffective in events where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time is of the essence. This seems mainly due to the ungainly size 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and subsequent slowness of the beast. hmmmm
</em><br>
<p>No, it is ineffective because prominent members find profit in
<br>
subverting civilization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; government's policy is our own. We own it. Get it? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And France's policy is its own. So why should you act against them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for expressing their views? If it is right and just to boycott French
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods and services simply because they didn't agree with our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions. Then we are saying 'if you don't vote the way we want you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to, we will punish you' or even simpler 'do as I say or else'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Democracy and freedom of speech, this is not.
</em><br>
<p>BS. Freedom of speech is not exclusive to one side or the other. Just
<br>
as Hollywood stars have a free speech right to express anti-war
<br>
opinions, I have a free speech right to not buy their movies and to
<br>
recommend to others that they do the same. Just as France has a free
<br>
speech right to express its opinion in the UN, I have a free speech
<br>
right to not buy its products and to recommend to others that they do
<br>
the same.
<br>
<p>The free market is its own democracy, and every dollar is a vote. When
<br>
you buy products from countries that are anti-American, you
<br>
economically support the proponents of anti-American policies. If Evian
<br>
does not support the French government policy and wants my money, they
<br>
can announce their support for our policy and opposition to France's
<br>
policy. I will then buy their products.
<br>
<p>Since France is basing its opposition to US policy on its desire for
<br>
profit from Iraqi oil, it evidently values the free market dollar vote
<br>
of French oil companies more than the dollar vote of American consumers
<br>
of French products.
<br>
<p>This crass commercialism is evident in the fact that France is now
<br>
asking the US state department for the right to bid on reconstruction
<br>
contracts, after announcing the other day that if Iraqi forces use WMD
<br>
in the war, they will change their policy. Since Iraq has now used over
<br>
a half dozen SCUD missiles it has claimed for a decade it did not
<br>
possess, targeting Kuwaiti civilian communities, I think it is
<br>
reasonable to suspect they have lied about a lot of other things.
