</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The farmers in the poor countries will loose the

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The farmers in the rich countries will not get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable price for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their products, as it is given away to the poor, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so will loose their 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>In both cases, you don't simply give the food away to
<br>
the poor.  Someone pays a reasonable price on behalf
<br>
of the poor.  In fact, that is more or less the system
<br>
we have today, except that in the areas where famine
<br>
happens, governments (in effect, if not always in
<br>
fact) seize the food that was going to the poor and
<br>
sell it for their own profit.  (Those who would buy
<br>
food on behalf of the poor only have so much money, so
<br>
they can not repurchase and redistribute that which
<br>
will be reseized indefinitely.)  At its simplest, this
<br>
is straight-up robbery - exchanging food for no value
<br>
(not even the abstract protection or other government
<br>
services that taxes pay for) - except it's legal.
<br>
(Or, at least, the robbers are never punished for
<br>
their deeds.)
<br>
<p>It's a distribution problem - as in, a problem with
<br>
the actual physical distribution.  In effect, those
<br>
under famine are being deprived of the right to buy
<br>
food, as we would understand &quot;buy&quot; (which includes the
<br>
right to use what one buys without having it taken
<br>
away).  This highlights one of the primary differences
<br>
among the world's governments: those who desire their
<br>
citizens to flourish and who live off the generated
<br>
excess, versus those who desire their own wealth and
<br>
standard of living first and foremost with little
<br>
regard for that of the governed.  (Though, it is of
<br>
note that the methods used to implement the latter
<br>
usually result in a worse standard of living for the
<br>
governing class than most people, including the
<br>
governing class, enjoy in the former.  This
<br>
self-defeating nature at the price of everyone
<br>
involved is one reason why the latter is often
<br>
regarded as &quot;evil&quot;.)
