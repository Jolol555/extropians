<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;First of all, let's change the rules: the burden of proof is on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;those who wish to support patents, not those who wish to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;remove them, because freedom should always be the default.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Patents reduce freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's say it differently then.  Patents reduce the ability to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovate and to extend previous innovations. 
</em><br>
<p>This could depend on what one thinks is a real innovation. 
<br>
<p>This is what the US Patent and Trademark Office think
<br>
a patent is  <a href="http://www.uspto.gov/main/glossary/index.html#p">http://www.uspto.gov/main/glossary/index.html#p</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;a property right granted by the Government of the United States
<br>
of America to an inventor &quot;to exclude others from making, using,
<br>
offering for sale, or selling the invention throughout the United States
<br>
or importing the invention into the United States&quot; for a limited time 
<br>
in exchange for public disclosure of the invention when the patent is
<br>
granted.&quot;
<br>
<p>The words &quot;in exchange for&quot; are key. They suggest what the policy 
<br>
reason is for having patents - that the invention be understandable
<br>
and potentially reproducable by anyone so interested after the patent
<br>
period expires. Even before the patent period expires academics can
<br>
often get to tinker (this may vary between patent systems). But any 
<br>
particular patent that does not satisfy the quid pro quo between 
<br>
inventor and government on behalf of society may not be worth the
<br>
paper its written on if it is challenged. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is seen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially clearly in the case of software patents. 
</em><br>
<p>There could be some real problems in software IP laws. Software
<br>
is relatively new compared to patent law and copyright law and it is
<br>
certainly possible the systems for optimising the quid pro quo in this
<br>
area are still being developed. If so there maybe opportunities to 
<br>
innovate in developing the terrain but you may need to be willing
<br>
to step beyond IT alone to capitalise on them. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I did a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably complete patent search every time I designed and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implemented a new system the legal cost would kill most of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects before the design had even gelled.
</em><br>
<p>If the system is small it is unlikely to be of much interest either to
<br>
you to protect or to someone else to check out and see if you
<br>
infringed their IP. 
<br>
<p>If the system is big then perhaps it is not wise to attempt to design
<br>
a substantial system without knowing what alternative means of 
<br>
achieving the solution are already available.
<br>
<p>Perhaps there is even a commercial opportunity in learning how
<br>
to do those searches for other people. Are you good at doing these
<br>
searches? This would seem to be a skill worth having just for personal
<br>
use if its readily acquirable (which I doubt) and maybe worth nutting
<br>
out and packaging into a general solution for other people like you if
<br>
it takes a lot of work but it can be systematised. Maybe you could 
<br>
team up with an IP lawyer with some spare time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Voluntary licensing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and variable fees [mean] that companies and individuals can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prohibit would be competitors from even entering the game.  We 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all lose by this. 
</em><br>
<p>There would be reasonable limits to what can be charged in terms
<br>
of licencing fees etc. That these limits are not tested legally because
<br>
of cost or lack of understanding of legal processes does not mean
<br>
that they can't be. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even fixed priced mandatory licensing  introduce substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drag and impetus to twist designs to avoid the additional costs.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not really following your example here Samantha. Could be you
<br>
have a case for patent or IP reform (its certainly possible such exists
<br>
in IT) but I don't get enough detail from what your saying to know
<br>
that it is the patent or IP laws per se that are the problem.
