<p><em>&gt; Robert, I understand how we can apply whole genome engineering to

</em><br>
<p>I too would like to know how... :-)  And I think I do.  There may be some
<br>
further problems down the road, but if look at the costs for DNA synthesis
<br>
right now it would cost you $1 million to synthesize a complete genome.
<br>
Nobody is going to even try that when they expect the first one will
<br>
not function correctly...  Sure you could build one just like an existing
<br>
genome but what have you learned then?  You would have to build a dozen
<br>
more changing them little by little to see if you understood things well
<br>
enough.  You have to lower that cost.  But I think I know how to solve
<br>
that problem.  How I want to try to do that is an industrial secret.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My reasoning is that for microbes we have dozens of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genomes from which not only we can analyze what are the important parts,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but also how to engineer a microbe's genome to suit our tasks--or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; create a whole genome from scratch as I believe some scientists are trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to.
</em><br>
<p>Some industrial engineering takes place, but I believe it is only in Japan
<br>
where they want to produce large quantities of vitamins (I'm reasonably
<br>
sure most of the vitamins sold in the world come from there) or in the
<br>
big Pharma companies where they want to produce antibiotics.  In those
<br>
cases they may add multiple genes for the enzymes they need.  An example
<br>
I think in eukaryotes would be &quot;golden rice&quot;. But it is moderately
<br>
difficult work (to completely optimize the genome to maximize
<br>
production) and so people are only going to try it if there is
<br>
a pile of money to be made.
<br>
<p>Venter's crew at the Institute for Biological Energy Alternatives
<br>
or perhaps the people from TIGR are trying to create a whole
<br>
genome from scratch but I think they are first planning to spend
<br>
a great deal of time to confirm what a minimal genome is.
<br>
That makes a certain amount of sense because given the cost
<br>
of assembling a genome one would want to make it as small as
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My problem with engineering the human genome is that we need a lot more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammalian genomes. You mention we can &quot;patch our genomes using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intracellular bacteria&quot;. The idea is certainly exciting, and I sure hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can make it real in a few years. But I can think of so many technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems in the idea that I wonder how you will pull it off. Even so I wish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you the best of luck.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I don't intend to *start* there -- there is a lot of experience that
<br>
will be required before one attempts that.  But I think we may be able
<br>
to get there in a decade.  One of your problems will probably be solved
<br>
by US Genomics they are working on some methods that will allow very
<br>
fast and inexpensive sequencing.  We will have a lot more genomes when
<br>
they finally produce results.  And we will not be able to just throw
<br>
bacteria with whole genomes into your blood -- your immune system will
<br>
go crazy.  But I think I've got at least two solutions for this problem
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for HIV, I'm sure we will eventually find a cure. My argument is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pace at which developments at a molecular level have been made in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight against HIV will not suffice if we are to find ways to cure aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a reasonable future.
</em><br>
<p>RNAi for the transcribed genes, receptor blockers combined that allow
<br>
the virus to enter the cells with the current enzyme blocking drugs
<br>
are going to make it *pretty* tough for the virus to reproduce or spread.
<br>
I would tend to agree that up until now it has seemed &quot;impossible&quot;.
<br>
But now we know all of the genes that cause the accelerated aging
<br>
diseases, except one.  We know Xeroderma Pigmentosum, Trichothiodystrophy,
<br>
Fanconi's Anemia, Werner's Syndrome, Ataxia Telangectasia.  The only
<br>
one we don't know is Progeria.  Given our existing methods, it should
<br>
only be a few years to know who the proteins for these genes interact
<br>
with and what precisely they do.  That is going to help alot (and helps
<br>
explain why progress has been so slow to date).  Before we had a
<br>
fundamental lack of understanding as to what aging was.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They won't even suffice to cure cancer.
</em><br>
<p>Here you are partially correct.  But very precise drugs like Gleevec
<br>
are performing *very* *very* well.  There is also some good promise
<br>
for the angiogenesis inhibitors or similar drugs once they figure
<br>
out which combination(s) to use.  I strongly suspect once you block
<br>
one angiogenesis protein the cancer just pulls another one out of the hat
<br>
since there are several of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need faster ways to gather data, interpret results, and develop effective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interventions in medical science. You give a few examples of how things are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shaping up and I certainly hope they do because the current pace of medical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress won't be enough.
</em><br>
<p>I gave a few above.  Others would include the current rapid drug
<br>
screening methods.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, I'm totally in favor of a comparative genomics approach to study
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aging. As I mentioned in previous e-mails, I've been trying to publish an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article on the subject for months now. Yet my approach is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mammalian genomes, since I estimate several of these will be available long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before we have, say, a turtle's genome.
</em><br>
<p>Not if US Genomics pulls the rabbit out of the hat.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All the best.
</em><br>
<p>Same to you.  Sorry it took so long for me to respond, I didn't previously
<br>
notice the note.
