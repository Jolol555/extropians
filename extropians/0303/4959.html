<p>Sun's Output Increasing in Possible Trend Fueling Global Warming
<br>

<br>
<p>In what could be the simplest explanation for one component of global
<br>
warming, a new study shows the Sun's radiation has increased by .05
<br>
percent per decade since the late 1970s.
<br>
<p>The increase would only be significant to Earth's climate if it has
<br>
been going on for a century or more, said study leader Richard Willson,
<br>
a Columbia University researcher also affiliated with NASA's Goddard
<br>
Institute for Space Studies.
<br>
<p>The Sun's increasing output has only been monitored with precision
<br>
since satellite technology allowed necessary observations. Willson is
<br>
not sure if the trend extends further back in time, but other studies
<br>
suggest it does.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The recent trend of a .05 percent per decade increase in Total Solar
<br>
Irradiance (TSI) in watts per meter squared, or the amount of solar
<br>
energy that falls upon a square meter outside the Earth’s atmosphere.
<br>
The trend was measured between successive solar minima that occur
<br>
approximately every 11 years. At the bottom, the timeline of the many
<br>
different datasets that contributed to this finding, from 1978 to
<br>
present.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;This trend is important because, if sustained over many decades, it
<br>
could cause significant climate change,&quot; Willson said. 
<br>
<p>In a NASA-funded study recently published in Geophysical Research
<br>
Letters, Willson and his colleagues speculate on the possible history
<br>
of the trend based on data collected in the pre-satellite era. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Solar activity has apparently been going upward for a century or
<br>
more,&quot; Willson told SPACE.com today.
<br>
<p>Significant component
<br>
<p>Further satellite observations may eventually show the trend to be
<br>
short-term. But if the change has indeed persisted at the present rate
<br>
through the 20th Century, &quot;it would have provided a significant
<br>
component of the global warming the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
<br>
Change reports to have occurred over the past 100 years,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>That does not mean industrial pollution has not been a significant
<br>
factor, Willson cautioned.
<br>
<p>Scientists, industry leaders and environmentalists have argued for
<br>
years whether humans have contributed to global warming, and to what
<br>
extent. The average surface temperature around the globe has risen by
<br>
about 1 degree Fahrenheit since 1880. Some scientists say the increase
<br>
could be part of natural climate cycles. Others argue that greenhouse
<br>
gases produced by automobiles and industry are largely to blame. 
<br>
<p>Willson said the Sun's possible influence has been largely ignored
<br>
because it is so difficult to quantify over long periods.
<br>
<p>Confounding efforts to determine the Sun's role is the fact that its
<br>
energy output waxes and wanes every 11 years. This solar cycle, as it
<br>
is called, reached maximum in the middle of 2000 and achieved a second
<br>
peak in 2002. It is now ramping down toward a solar minimum that will
<br>
arrive in about three years.
<br>
<p>Connections
<br>
<p>Changes in the solar cycle -- and solar output -- are known to cause
<br>
short-term climate change on Earth. At solar max, Earth's thin upper
<br>
atmosphere can see a doubling of temperature. It swells, and denser air
<br>
can puff up to the region of space where the International Space
<br>
Station orbits, causing increased drag on the ship and forcing more
<br>
frequent boosts from space shuttles. 
<br>
<p>Solar max has also been tied to a 2 percent increase in clouds over
<br>
much of the United States. 
<br>
<p>It might seem logical to assume tie climate to solar output, but firm
<br>
connections are few. Other studies looking further back in time have
<br>
suggested a connection between longer variations in solar activity and
<br>
temperatures on Earth.
<br>
<p>Examinations of ancient tree rings and other data show temperatures
<br>
declined starting in the 13th Century, bottomed out at 2 degrees below
<br>
the long-term average during the 17th Century, and did not climb back
<br>
to previous levels until the late 19th Century. Separate records of
<br>
sunspots, auroral activity (the Northern Lights) and terrestrial
<br>
deposits of certain substances generated in atmospheric reactions
<br>
triggered by solar output, suggest the Sun was persistently active
<br>
prior to the onset of this Little Ice Age, as scientists call the
<br>
event. 
<br>
<p>Solar activity was lowest during the 17th Century, when Earth was most
<br>
frigid.
<br>
<p>Large-scale ocean and climate variations on Earth can also mask
<br>
long-term trends and can make it difficult to sort out what is normal,
<br>
what is unusual, and which effects might or might not result from
<br>
shifts in solar radiation.
<br>
<p>To get above all this, scientists rely on measurements of total solar
<br>
energy, at all wavelengths, outside Earth's atmosphere. The figure they
<br>
derive is called Total Solar Irradiance (TSI).
<br>
<p>Heating up
<br>
<p>The new study shows that the TSI has increased by about 0.1 percent
<br>
over 24 years. That is not enough to cause notable climate change,
<br>
Willson and his colleagues say, unless the rate of change were
<br>
maintained for a century or more.
<br>
<p>On time scales as short as several days, the TSI can vary by 0.2
<br>
percent due to the number and size of sunspots crossing the face of the
<br>
Sun. That shift, said to be insignificant to weather, is however equal
<br>
to the total amount of energy used by humans, globally, for a year, the
<br>
researchers estimate.
<br>
<p>The study analyzed data from six satellites orbiting Earth at different
<br>
times over the 24 years. Willson ferreted out errors in one of the
<br>
datasets that had prevented previous studies from discovering the
<br>
trend.
<br>
<p>A separate recent study of Sun-induced magnetic activity near Earth,
<br>
going back to 1868, provides compelling evidence that the Sun's current
<br>
increase in output goes back more than a century, Willson said. 
<br>
<p>He said firm conclusions about whether the present changes involve a
<br>
long-term trend or a relatively brief aberration should come with
<br>
continued monitoring into the next solar minimum, expected around 2006.
