<br>
<p>&quot;Actually, I think I may have been the one to describe the device you
<br>
mention.&quot;
<br>
<p>If so, I do think it an excellent idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A cheap, simple implant anyone could get.  Ideally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be even better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if such a device could power external electronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devices.  
</em><br>
<p>&quot;It'd produce miniscule amounts of power - but then, many devices only need
<br>
miniscule amounts of power.
<br>
So, no using yourself as a battery for an electric car, but you could maybe
<br>
use this to run (or at least
<br>
trickle-recharge, when it's not actively being used) a PDA.&quot;
<br>
<p>It would be nice, at least with later versions, if you could alter the rate
<br>
at which it is processing carbs.  But to start with, a very simple, small
<br>
egg like device is implanted that burns around 100 Calories per day.
<br>
<p>&quot;though what energy they do generate would have to be disposed of somehow
<br>
(possibly via an inductive loop, the second part of which is placed on or
<br>
near the skin near the implant every day, maybe week, to activate the
<br>
discharge so as to avoid needing wires or sockets permanently sticking out
<br>
of the skin).&quot;
<br>
<p>I am no electrical engineer, but I think the inductive loop method is the
<br>
best way to go as well for tapping any energy created by the device.  For
<br>
starters though, 100 Cals per day isnt much, an average adult male has an
<br>
RDA of ~2200 Cal, and disapates all the heat readily from that.  I don't
<br>
think an additional 100 Cals will make a big difference, in fact the body
<br>
will probably be able to dissapate that heat quicker than it is generated
<br>
from the device.  Coupling that with the fact that the bodies normal
<br>
diffusion processes will remove all the by products of such a device, it
<br>
should end up being cheap, simple, and small.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's the biochemical parts that present the biggest challenge.  But the
<br>
biggest challenge, at least to us, would seem to be the practical matters of
<br>
actually doing it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Of course, but with the various backgrounds on the extropy list, and the
<br>
collected intelligence of it, there is no reason it shouldn't be doable.
<br>
Quite frankly I am surprised it has not generated more interest, here we
<br>
have a perfect example of an extropian piece of technology, that no one
<br>
appears to be working on, that will likely be readily accepted by the
<br>
average Joe, will clearly demonstrate that technology can be used to
<br>
direclty solve individual humans problems.  Imagine the press this could
<br>
generate for extropian ideals if it brandished the logo of the EXI
<br>
institute.  People would start to realize that the business of using
<br>
technology to better our lives has some potential.  Here they have some real
<br>
technology that directly makes *my life* better, *right now*... (I know all
<br>
technology has a significant impact on our lives, but the average Joe
<br>
doesn't think about it or recognize the value of electricity or combustion
<br>
engines, etc.) 
<br>
<p>&quot;How would we test it?  (Yes, it's great to say, &quot;in theory, one could do
<br>
animal testing&quot;.  Does
<br>
any of us have the appropriate equipment or licenses for this?  If not, how
<br>
could we obtain such?)&quot;
<br>
<p>Well thousands of companies do similar things all the time, so it should be
<br>
doable.  Besides, those two egregiously overweight cats that spike posted
<br>
would probably volunteer if we could explain it to them, if not their owners
<br>
might be volunteer them.  
<br>
<p>&quot;Granted, one could start up a business around this product alone, so that
<br>
presents one possible source of
<br>
funding (VCs).&quot;
<br>
<p>I think one could as well, and I think it could be quite profitable.  I plan
<br>
to pursue it once I finish laying the foundation for my current venture, but
<br>
a collected extropy member effort could bring about such a device much
<br>
quicker.
