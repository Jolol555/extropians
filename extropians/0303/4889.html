<p><em>&gt; I cannot help but being somewhat amazed about the difference in power of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqi and the coalition forces. It is probably many things that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works together here, to make this difference.
</em><br>
<p>It is my understanding that Iraq is a country at the brink of
<br>
industrialization.  Which means it is at least a century behind the
<br>
times.  That is one large gap.  We are looking at a country that
<br>
supposedly imported dairy equipment (!) pumps to use in missiles
<br>
because they couldn't manufacture such parts locally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it seems that all the high tech weaponry developed by the US makes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an enourmeous difference in this war.
</em><br>
<p>As far as the final outcome is concerned, the coalition could lead
<br>
this war with WWII technology.  However, the addition technological
<br>
advantage makes the whole affair a lot cheaper in terms of equipment
<br>
and casualties, and makes it easier on the civilian population.
<br>
<p>Look at the precision bombardment Baghdad is suffering.  While much
<br>
of the world is all riled up about collateral damages and civilian
<br>
casualties, I suggest to gain some perspective.  The WWII equivalent
<br>
of those air raids were swarms of bombers dropping lots of ordnance
<br>
all over a city.  Hitting the right quarter was a success in
<br>
targeting.  Nowadays, individual buildings are picked out with a
<br>
substantial degree of success.  Apart from sparing much of the
<br>
civiliation population, this of course also benefits the military
<br>
attack.  It is rather exasperating to level the better part of a
<br>
city but miss the actually designated targets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And amazingly enough there dosn't seem to be any efficient counter 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meassures to these hightech weapons.
</em><br>
<p>That is the point really.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ie. with laser guided precision bombs, it would seem obvious for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqis to put up powerfull lasers pointing anywhere else than on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important infrastructure, so as to confuse the guided bombs.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know the details of laser targeting, but I suspect it doesn't
<br>
work this way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And naturally air superiority is paramount, so the country ought to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massively packed with SAM's.
</em><br>
<p>And where do you propose would those SAMs come from?  Grown on trees?
<br>
<p>(Besides, I'm not aware of any war where air defense succeeded over
<br>
enemy air power.  To counter enemy planes, you need interceptors
<br>
in the air.  AA and SAMs don't cut it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This left mo wondering if all this is caused by the fact that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqi's has been relatively isolated, and has no modern weapons anymore, 
</em><br>
<p>Today's Iraq does not look like a match for any of the major
<br>
combatants of WWII.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or simply because there is a difference in weaponry that is rising 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponentially?
</em><br>
<p>Well, the current campaign looks just like the one in 1991 to me.
<br>
Of course I'm neither a military expert nor do I have any idea what
<br>
is actually going on, beyond the rumors currently circulating through
<br>
the Western media.  Quite a lot of the American equipment in use
<br>
dates back a couple of decades, but I can't tell how effective the
<br>
incremental modernization is that has been going on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is also a clear example on why it is important that these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies belong to &quot;benign&quot; countries.
</em><br>
<p>On the other hand, monopolies are bad.  I certainly don't relish
<br>
the prospect of US carriers in the North Sea, telling us, sorry
<br>
folks, we can't allow nano development in Europe.
<br>
<p>You know, this benign country thing sounds all fine and dandy as
<br>
long as it's *your* country and you agree with its policies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But perhaps there is some kind of aoutomation in this, in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the free and rich countries are better able to develop advanced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology?
</em><br>
<p>Pick up some books and check out who during WWII used cruise missiles
<br>
and ballistic rockets, who introduced guided bombs and jet fighters,
<br>
who had the superior tanks and invented the assault rifle.  Of
<br>
course, the attribute rich applied there, I think.  Free, well,
<br>
that would be subject to some debate, I guess.  Modern weapons
<br>
development and production requires a rich industrial base.  So the
<br>
question is really, which societies are more likely to prosper
<br>
economically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The joker in this, is the rising power of the individual/small state due 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to even more advanced technologies (NABC - Nano, Atomic, Bio, Chem). But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the best way to avoid individuals/small states being angry enough to use 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NABC's as a tool of terror, is to ensure wealth, freedom and democracy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for as many people as possible.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should this lead to more preemptive strikes, to ensure freedom and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy?
</em><br>
<p>Tricky...
