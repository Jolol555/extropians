<p><em>&gt; This kind of

</em><br>
<p>By this argument it seems that a significant fraction of what
<br>
much of humanity engages in could be replaced by &quot;functional&quot;
<br>
equivalents over the next decade or two.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is really what uploading is about.
</em><br>
<p>No!  What uploading is &quot;about&quot; is being able to produce a
<br>
distributed replicated intelligence as I discussed at Extro3.
<br>
Without that entities are limited by their hazard function
<br>
which on average is 2000-7000 years (depending on whose figures
<br>
you are working with).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But as my colleauges have pointed out, why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not replace myself by a set of very good actors? These actors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would learn everything relevant about the behavior and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations of me, and eventually take my place.
</em><br>
<p>Of course the question becomes whether a collection of actors
<br>
emulating Anders would be as creative as Anders...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My own argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against this is of course that many of my internal processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are only (and can only be) privately known such as my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness, would not be transferred in such a scheme.
</em><br>
<p>Yea, but we don't care about *your* consciousness (except in
<br>
a very general humanitarian way).  [Of course there may be
<br>
exceptions for those list members who are actually in love with
<br>
Anders.]  The two flaws I see against this are (a) Can the
<br>
actors replicate Anders creativity?  [In which case the global
<br>
community could care less if the Anders upload suffers a UPS
<br>
failure]; or (b) is Anders unemulatable?  Anders, perhaps more
<br>
than many others, has a sufficient public record that his
<br>
perspective can be known, deduced, projected.  Would Anders
<br>
claim that neuvo-Anders could not be produced by computational
<br>
systems with 10x - 100x - 1000x the computational capacity of Anders?
<br>
One has to keep in mind that the computational capacity of a *single*
<br>
node of an MBrain (i.e. a Drexlerian nanocomputer) is 10^5 to 10^6
<br>
times that of a single human brain.
<br>
<p>Regarding Saddam, a recent U.S. PBS special discussing him revealed
<br>
that his private library is filled with books discussing Stalin's
<br>
perspective and methods.  The world is better off with him (and
<br>
his ideas) either dead or frozen until we can come up with a
<br>
reasonable strategy for reforming them.
