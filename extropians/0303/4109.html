Sorry, Correction on that second link, it should be this:

<br>

<br>
<p><p>An Example of Willie Weir's writing from the pages of the
<br>
Adventure Cyclist, here is a portion from his story:
<br>
_Center of Attention_
<br>
<p>--------------
<br>
<p>If you are looking to get your ego stroked,you need to avoid
<br>
gatherings of cyclists. Sure you'll find comradeship and common
<br>
interests. But when you mention your latest trip over the Rockies,
<br>
it will not be met with awe, but with &quot;You think the Rockies are
<br>
hard? Try the highlands of Ubetchastan. &quot;
<br>
<p>Early on in my travel career, I discovered that youth hostels or
<br>
&quot;backpackers&quot; were great places to raise my self-esteem to dizzying
<br>
heights. Here were establishments filled with adventurous English-
<br>
speaking (albeit, mostly as a second language) travelers and each
<br>
and every one had arrived by train, car or bus. I would always
<br>
relish the moment in the kitchen or at the dinner table when someone
<br>
would ask how long I'd been on the road and from where and then
<br>
discover I'd pedaled. Instant celebrity.
<br>
<p>It was with this knowledge and experience that I entered a hostel
<br>
in Costa Rica. A small inn, packed with world travelers in the
<br>
lush rain forests of Montevideo. No one saw me check in, so my mode
<br>
of transportation was not known. At the dinner table were seated a
<br>
couple from New Zealand. Four Germans. Three Italians. A South
<br>
African. A Canadian and two beautiful coeds from Basel, Switzerland.
<br>
<p>I cooked up rice and beans and joined the group in the eating area.
<br>
They were talking politics and music. Almost 30 minutes had gone by
<br>
and no one had asked me the correct leading question. So I decided
<br>
to initiate the topic myself. I turned to the Canadian, a skinny,
<br>
bearded man in his 20s and asked him where he'd come from.
<br>
<p>&quot;I started up around the Arctic Circle.&quot;
<br>
<p>The two attractive Swiss women perked up their ears. This was not
<br>
the way it was supposed to play out. He was supposed to say,
<br>
&quot;Vancouver&quot; or &quot;Took the bus out of Cleveland&quot; and then ask, &quot;How
<br>
about you?&quot;
<br>
<p>He went back to eating his pasta.
<br>
<p>Not much of a conversationalist.
<br>
<p>I prodded him again with, &quot;How long have you been on the road?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;About 14 months. &quot;
<br>
<p>Now the entire room had his attention. Now I just had to swing the
<br>
conversation to me and the stage would be mine. &quot;Did you travel by
<br>
bus or train or did you mostly hitchhike?&quot;
<br>
<p>No matter what his answer was, I could counter with, &quot;I find
<br>
pedaling to be the best way to see the world. &quot;
<br>
<p>He looked up from his bowl and matter-of-factly stated.
<br>
<p>&quot;No. I walked. How about you?&quot;
<br>
<p>There was a long, long pause, during which a seven-year-old boy
<br>
climbed down the ladder of a diving board and with his head hung low
<br>
shuffled into the locker room.
<br>
<p>&quot;Never mind. &quot;
<br>
