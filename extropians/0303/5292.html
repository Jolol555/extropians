<p>Not for long, and hopefully I wouldn't see enough to bother me.

<em> &gt; I truly don't understand the rules, Eliezer. Perhaps it's just the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>What I mean is that Natasha or Greg Burch would swoop down and make the 
<br>
two-day ban after an unlabeled posting part of the list rules, after which 
<br>
any Extropians reader could send to someone to say:  &quot;You didn't label 
<br>
this posting as Iraq, please don't post for two days.&quot;  One rule, 
<br>
distributed enforcement.  The ban is for two days, and not a month or 
<br>
whatever, because it's intended as a gentle reminder - i.e., the 
<br>
presumption is that the poster just forgot to label the post, and was not 
<br>
deliberately intending to ruin anyone's day.  If that doesn't work, or if 
<br>
some people ignore the two-day bans, then we can move on to enforcement of 
<br>
longer-term bans by the list owners.  I.e., distributed enforcement backed 
<br>
up by moderation.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I *did* label _my_ most florid transgression clearly as a FLAME. Perhaps
</em><br>
<em> &gt; you could add that keyword to your plonk list? Or is it too likely that
</em><br>
<em> &gt; most correspondents will not be as forthcoming?
</em><br>
<p>I am not going to try and add everyone's favorite keyword to my plonk 
<br>
list, in the process losing &quot;Damien wins award&quot; every time someone decides 
<br>
the WAR keyword is a good idea, etc.  Stick with IRAQ.
