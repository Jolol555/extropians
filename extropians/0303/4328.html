I see no reason to assume the &quot;liberal&quot; part of that statement.  Nothing 
<br>
about the current administration is liberal in any other context, and it 
<br>
would be quite difficult to do so even with the best of intents.  The 
<br>
people may hate their current leader, but appearantly they feel that 
<br>
during the last war the US intentionally used depleted uranium weapons 
<br>
in order to cause cancer among civilians living in the area.  Also 
<br>
appearantly there is a large excess of cancers around the area where the 
<br>
depleted uranium weapons were used.  And also the US appears to be 
<br>
planning to use the same weapons this time.  Now possibly the populace 
<br>
is unreasonable in seeing these weapons as intentionally designed to 
<br>
poison civilians ... but seeing it that way, I don't believe that any 
<br>
&quot;nation building&quot; could be done by the party that they believe has been 
<br>
intentionally poisoning them.

<p>(My reference for this was a quite recent issue of the New Scientist.  
<br>
It's a report of a medic [medical student?] who was travelling to 
<br>
observe conditions.)
