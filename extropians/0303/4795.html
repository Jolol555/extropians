<p>### Yes, now I understand what you meant. Still, I would find it useful
<br>
if we could come up with a concise terminology differentiating the
<br>
various flavors of libertarianism. I am of the group who accept a
<br>
tax-supported government for provision of some types of mainly
<br>
second-order public goods (protection against massive, organized
<br>
violence, provision of some limited types of information, legal rules on
<br>
information disclosure and tort liability insurance), as well as being
<br>
the payor of last resort in merit-based charity. I wonder what that
<br>
should be called. Non-anarchist libertarian? Minarchist?
<br>
Libertarian-lite?  
<br>

<em>&gt; BTW, A central government.. of any kind.. provides a big fat target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for any kind of aggression. If your society consists of a network
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of inconsequential nodes, then where do any possible aggressors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack? A network of nodes have little need of a defense against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organized external aggression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
### The solution is simple - you go after every single little node,
<br>
relentlessly kill anybody in your way. Sooner, rather than later,
<br>
everybody alive will surrender and become cogs in your machine.
<br>
<p>Vinge used an assumption to make his &quot;Ungoverned&quot; scenario plausible -
<br>
massively improved economic efficiency in the ungoverned areas compared
<br>
to the politically organized neighbors allowed even single citizens to
<br>
oppose an invasion (bobbling was a useful literary device, too). This
<br>
assumption might be true - indeed, I do believe that a well-organized
<br>
anarchy (sounds like an oxymoron, perhaps, but you know what I mean)
<br>
might the superior economic system. Still, for the anarchy to
<br>
successfully resist an invasion without developing a political
<br>
organization of its own (and becoming just another state) requires a
<br>
very significant edge in technology and it is not clear how it could be
<br>
achieved and maintained.
