</em><br>
<p>But that is exactly what FOX does! It's billed as neutral when it is not.
<br>
&quot;News without the spin,&quot; they say. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then you really do want distorted information, war [is] full of 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm referring to the journalism itself, not to the events reported. 
<br>
<p>Example: 
<br>
<p>Yesterday 3/28 Neil Cavuto responded on the air to a professor who had
<br>
complained (correctly, imo) that Neil Cavuto &quot;wears his bias on his sleeve.&quot;
<br>
<p>Here are selected excerpts from Neil Cavuto's insulting diatribe in response
<br>
to the professor. This is what Cavuto said to the professor live on FOX last
<br>
evening:
<br>
<p>-----
<br>
&quot;Well, professor, get over it.
<br>
<p>You might have a problem thanking troops defending your right to be the
<br>
obnoxious, pontificating jerk that you are, but I don't....
<br>
<p>I'm not sure what runs through your veins, professor, but something tells me
<br>
it's ice. Too cold to appreciate the rights you take for granted. And colder
<br>
still to acknowledge the men and women fighting for your right to be the
<br>
callous elitist you are.
<br>
<p>So am I slanted and biased? You damn well bet, professor....
<br>
<p>You have the right to be the self-absorbed, condescending imbecile you
<br>
apparently are and I have the right to tell you that....
<br>
<p>You say I wear my biases on my sleeve. Well, better that than pretend you
<br>
have none, but show them clearly in your work.
<br>
<p>You're a lie, a fraud and an ingrate. Too clueless to appreciate the country
<br>
that gives you the right to be the Ivy League intellectual Lilliputian you
<br>
are. And too selfish to be grateful that in this country, even your type can
<br>
find work.&quot;
<br>
-----
<br>
<p>In less than a minute, Neil Cavuto managed to call this professor a
<br>
&quot;pontificating jerk,&quot; a &quot;callous elitist,&quot; a &quot;self-absorbed condescending
<br>
imbecile,&quot; a &quot;lie and fraud and an ingrate,&quot; an &quot;intellectual Lilliputian,&quot;
<br>
who is &quot;clueless&quot; and &quot;selfish&quot; and who has &quot;ice running through his veins.&quot;
<br>
<p>That's typical FOX journalism. I'm sure the kids love it.
