Hi Extropes,
<br>
<p>Whilst I may continue to debate with some other list 
<br>
members the relevance and importance of international law
<br>
it is worth pointing out that international law exists. (It is the
<br>
bases of the Geneva conventions too). That it does exist, 
<br>
and that it is important remains common ground to all the
<br>
heads of state of member nations of the UN, but perhaps,
<br>
especially to the heads of permanent security council
<br>
members. Presidents Bush and Chirac do NOT dispute
<br>
the existence of international law, or that their countries are
<br>
signatures to the UN Charter. Rather they DO dispute what
<br>
the law is. And that dispute is crucial both to the nature of this
<br>
war and to the prospects of making any international peace.
<br>
<p>I realize that international law is probably outside the comfort
<br>
zones and normal areas of immediate interest for many people
<br>
including some of the bright capable people who frequent this
<br>
list. But right now is not a good time for smart folks to be 
<br>
allowing international law to become a new form of scripture
<br>
and to assume that it can only be interpreted to commonfolk
<br>
by priesthoods of various political persuasions. It has been 
<br>
said that democracies get the governments that they deserve.
<br>
And Sagan has written a book that is part of the recommended
<br>
reading list called the Demon Haunted World. I would 
<br>
encourage all extropes to look beyond the temptation to 
<br>
merely stick with the easy emotional biases that come to all of
<br>
us and to 'take a good look through the telescope' rather than
<br>
just guess at the truth. If extropic goals are to be realised in 
<br>
our lifetimes we cannot afford to be too introspective with
<br>
respect to the affairs and politics of the world. Now is not
<br>
the time, international law is not an issue, in which it is 
<br>
sensible for people with extropic aspirations to take the 
<br>
view that they can afford to be tourists, passengers, or 
<br>
uncritical believers. If we do, we become part of the 
<br>
problem, part of the inertia against change that we are
<br>
trying to work against. We cede more power to politicians
<br>
and demand of them less accountability each time we fail to
<br>
engage. Death and conservatism are the defaults. 
<br>
<p>I commend to those extropes who wish to engage with 
<br>
the substantial challenges of our times with their own minds
<br>
directly the following legal opinions for their own personal
<br>
consideration. They are not an easy read necessarily but if
<br>
you accept as I do that the rule of law and the honouring of
<br>
agreements is not irrelevant to extropic aspirations them I 
<br>
urge you to recognize that they are an important read.
<br>
<p>Here is a link (one page only and a repost) to the
<br>
Australian and UK Attorney General's argument in support
<br>
of the view that the war would be lawful.
<br>
<p><a href="http://open.gov.uk/NewsRoom/NRArticle/0,1169,223412~801b22~fs~en,00.html">http://open.gov.uk/NewsRoom/NRArticle/0,1169,223412~801b22~fs~en,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>Now here is a link to one of two opinions provided to the
<br>
Australian Federal Opposition Leader Simon Crean 
<br>
arguing, after having had the opportunity to consider the 
<br>
above, that the war is illegal.

<br>
<p>The other supporting opinion, provided to the Opposition
<br>
leader, and which I have sourced from its author, I can also
<br>
make available to any one that is interested.   
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
