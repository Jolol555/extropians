<em>&gt; &gt; That's interesting, as the Israeli army has admitted it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; an accident. Apparently this was an armored bulldozer with

<em>&gt; &gt; restricted vision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When I heard about this I assumed it was an accident too.  However,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;below is a link to a site with pictures of the incident.  You can see
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rachel Corrie standing on a mound with what appears to be a direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt;line of sight to the driver.  She's wearing a bright safety-orange
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jacket and has a megaphone pointed at the driver.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;After seeing this, and hearing eye witness reports, I believe this was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an act of murder.  Possibly the bulldozer driver thought she was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;just&quot; a palestinian, and who would really notice or care if he killed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one of those in the course of his job?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here's the site with the pictures.  Warning: there are a couple shots
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of her after being run over.  Also, this is clearly a biased site, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the pictures speak for themselves.

<p>When I first visited the sight, I too was appalled that the Israeli driver 
<br>
would claim not be ignorant of someone who was clearly standing and 
<br>
shouting at him through a microphone.  Also, she is shown to be standing 
<br>
off to the side and the bulldozer driver would clearly have had to swerve 
<br>
to hit her.  However, I later read through several news sources that said a 
<br>
variety of things and tried to piece together exactly what happened
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=273498&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0">http://www.haaretzdaily.com/hasen/pages/ShArt.jhtml?itemNo=273498&amp;contrassID=2&amp;subContrassID=1&amp;sbSubContrassID=0</a><br>
says that she had climbed up onto the bulldozer blade before falling 
<br>
underneath it.
<br>
<p>CNN says that some witnesses claim she was in plain view, while other 
<br>
witnesses say that she had fallen behind a pile of rubble, out of sight, 
<br>
beforehand.
<br>
<p><a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134654821_protester17m.html">http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/134654821_protester17m.html</a> 
<br>
says that she had climbed up onto a pile of rubble in front of the 
<br>
bulldozer, and semi-implies that she was still there when she was 
<br>
hit.  This would be in accordance with the pictures Electronic Intifada, 
<br>
but checking back the pictures of her on the rubble aren't labeled as 
<br>
having been taken right before her death, and on examination (at least of 
<br>
the uncropped versions available elsewhere) show that they were taken in a 
<br>
slightly different location.
<br>
<p>In summary, I now believe that she died...somehow...under an Israeli 
<br>
bulldozer while trying to stop it from demolishing a house for some 
<br>
reason.  Anything else would be pure speculation on my part, and in any 
<br>
event people have notoriously horrible memories of things that happen in 
<br>
situations like this; if five people witness an assassin walk up to his 
<br>
target, shoot him, and walk away they are likely to get five different 
<br>
discriptions.
<br>
