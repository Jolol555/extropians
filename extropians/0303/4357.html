<p>
A brief meditation on reputation, success and innovation:
<br>
<p>The year to be a young sf writer full of piss and vinegar was exactly half
<br>
a century back, especially if you lived in New York. Or maybe 1952, writing
<br>
the stories that appeared in the following magical year. My sense of that
<br>
epoch (when I was 8 or 9 in Australia, and my earliest self-published sf
<br>
stories were still several years off) is that the wonderful sf of the
<br>
mode's first true maturity appeared in a range of tin-pot garish zines of
<br>
rather modest circulation, written by men (mostly) who viewed sf writing as
<br>
a kind of Zen sport, like posting to rec.arts.sf.science, or a kind of
<br>
performance poetry, a delightful display that earned you whuffie or egoboo. 
<br>
<p>Few expected to make a living at it, even a mean one (but I might be wrong
<br>
about that). If this is the mind set of the great early adopters and
<br>
innovators, maybe it *can* be recovered in an era of almost cost-free
<br>
web-based distribution, even if not, ultimately, by the small presses using
<br>
paper and commercial delivery systems. 
<br>
<p>This sounds horribly like a prescription for fan fiction run amok, but if a
<br>
measure of reputation-based editorial filtering emerges (as perhaps it is
<br>
starting to), we might find that storing fiction on hard drives or
<br>
downloading it furtively on the office printer will become the equivalent
<br>
of the garish pulps of the early '50s. 
<br>
<p>I'm depressed by such a prospect; I was formed by a Zeitgeist that regarded
<br>
physical publication in paperback or, better yet, hard covers, with piety
<br>
and longing. But what I find depressing about my offerings at
<br>
Fictionwise.com, and shortly from eReads, isn't so much that they're not
<br>
available for me to put up on the brag shelf or take down and fondle, but
<br>
that so few readers have yet adopted this vector. Once true refreshable
<br>
e-paper arrives, things might improve for the revival of sf (by contrast
<br>
with fat consolatory fantasy n-ologies or Frankenscience thrillers).
<br>
Luckily, Greg Egan still seems to sell, and I'd regard him as precisely the
<br>
return of James Blish conducted by even harder means. 
<br>
<p>Which brings me back to whuffie:
<br>
<p>To a writer, one truly innovative and interesting aspect of web publication
<br>
and distribution is the possibility of instant feedback whuffie-meters like
<br>
the votes displayed at amazon.com and F/wise. It's always astonishing to
<br>
see the sheer range of reactions to the same text by the purchasing public.
<br>
Take a look at the (fairly small number of) votes, and their distribution, at 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/DamienBroderickeBooks.htm">http://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/DamienBroderickeBooks.htm</a>
<br>
<p>and then compare with some other award-winning sf writers, such as
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/BarryNMalzbergeBooks.htm">http://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/BarryNMalzbergeBooks.htm</a>
<br>
<p>or
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/RobertSilverbergeBooks.htm">http://www.fictionwise.com/eBooks/RobertSilverbergeBooks.htm</a>
<br>
<p>All over the bloody place. What can be learned from these distributions?
<br>
Maybe nothing much beyond Chacon á son gout?
<br>
