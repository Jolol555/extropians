Thanks. I agree that it seems likely that humans have gone through more
<br>
evolutionary bottlenecks, although there is still the question of how
<br>
pressures on phenotype relate to genome evolution--I'm thinking that to some
<br>
extent this will depend on whether Kimura's neutral theory of molecular
<br>
evolution is true, and to what extent. In general, though, I think people
<br>
tend to forget that whatever the percentage difference between us and chimps
<br>
is, it will probably be less than the difference between us and our most
<br>
recent common ape-like ancestors. (We can probably accept as unlikely
<br>
significant convergent evolution or horizontal transfer of genes). The
<br>
transhumanist cash-value of this question, in my mind, is that the smaller
<br>
the percentage difference between us and our most recent ape-like ancestor,
<br>
the more we can hope that relatively few genetic modifications may yield
<br>
quite big dividends.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
