In a message dated 3/27/2003 5:29:29 AM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20WAR:%20Apparently%20the%20internet%20does%20NOT%20see%20censorship%20as%20damage%20and%20route">Spudboy100@aol.com</a> quotes: and without Security Council sanction this war 
<br>
violates international law (according to the legal experts in this part of 
<br>
the world).  In fact, has there even been a proper declaration of war?--  
<br>
Christian &quot;naddy&quot; Weisgerber              
<br>
<p>Naddy,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You raise two points:
<br>
1.  International law.
<br>
2.  A proper declaration of war..
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I've observed international law at work and it seems to be a sometimes 
<br>
thing.  We have recently had a debate on that subject on these pages.  I did 
<br>
not participate in that debate nor do I know of any general conclusions that 
<br>
were agreed upon.  However, I do not know of our having ever voluntarily 
<br>
surrendered any part of our sovereignty to the UN -- witness our retaining 
<br>
our right to veto any decision of the security council.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your 2nd issue was to question whether or not there had been a &quot;proper 
<br>
declaration&quot; of war.  Our Constitution calls for Congress to declare war.  
<br>
There are no forms for us to fill out, there is no exact procedure to be 
<br>
followed beyond the Constitution making it clear that Congress is the only 
<br>
one with the legal power to declare war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, Congress has declared war via a formal resolution 
<br>
containing language that we were declaring war -- I strongly believe this was 
<br>
case with Japan and Germany in the 2nd World War.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IMHO, when our Congress passes a resolution authorizing our President 
<br>
to take military action in a particular situation that is the legal 
<br>
equivalent of a declaration of war.  Similarly, I know of no reason that 
<br>
Congress cannot declare a limited war if Congress in its wisdom decides to do 
<br>
so.  The Constitution only says that only Congress can declare war.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think about it having the power declare war invested in 
<br>
Congress makes great sense under our Constitution.  Under our Constitution 
<br>
only our Congress has the power to raise taxes or to authorize expenditure of 
<br>
any funds.  The two powers go together.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand our President is the Commander in Chief of our Armed 
<br>
Forces.  Congress in its wisdom leaves him some slack in using the military.  
<br>
For example if the island of Bermuda declares war on us and begins invading 
<br>
the state of Georgia then Congress has left the President sufficient funds 
<br>
that he can make an immediate response.  But he will soon find himself out of 
<br>
money unless Congress decides to declare war and vote the funds necessary to 
<br>
support the armed services.
<br>
