<p>Really?  Do you understand preemptive means before we have any 
<br>
reason for war?  You understand the likely repurcussions in 
<br>
terms of ever more hate and distrust of the US?  You understand 
<br>
the elevation of likely terrorist actions and the implications 
<br>
on freedom and privacy at home?  You understand how with 
<br>
increased secrecy within the US that nations can be painted with 
<br>
targets and attacked with less and less real checks and balances 
<br>
using your money and mine?  How determines what &quot;tyrannical&quot; is? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In many ways the US government is &quot;tyrannical&quot; if you look at 
<br>
it just so.  Do you really honestly support unending war?  If so 
<br>
I simply do not understand how this is extropic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You make it sound like the vast population of the developed world is extremely against the U.S. overthrowing Saddam's murderous, raping regime.  I don't buy into this.  Anyway, Americans are used to bearing heavy burdens when the rest of the world cannot or will not do the right thing.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>The vast majority is against preemptive war/invasion of Iraq and 
<br>
believe it is utterly unnecessary for achieving the originally 
<br>
stated goals of disarmament and that it is recklessly dangerous.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I do realize sometimes we do make mistakes, but if we play our cards right this will not be one of them.  The U.S. (yes, and even European nations) will get the chance to create a major democracy right in the center of the Arab middle east.  This could be the beginning of the road which leads to peace in the region!  Now that is something to rejoice about.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>We have already played the wrong card and stated our intention, 
<br>
which you seem to report, to keep on playing it.  I thought the 
<br>
only way to &quot;create a democracy&quot; is for the people of the region 
<br>
to choose and create it.  There is no way I am aware of to 
<br>
&quot;create a democracy&quot; from outside by force of arms.
