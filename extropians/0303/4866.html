<em>&gt;### Yes, this is correct, although you would still have the free-rider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem - people who would sign up with PPO's which had no mutual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defense contracts, and therefore would be cheaper. The other PPO's would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;need to maintain extra forces, verify to each other and to their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;customers that the forces really exist and are battle-worthy, and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would impose additional direct and transaction costs. Making sure that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your combined PPO army is any good would be pretty tricky without an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;occasional war, too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;One partial solution is for the PPO's to band together to destroy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;competitors unwilling to participate in the general defense fund (but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this would make them somewhat similar to a territorial state), and to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pass the names of individuals without PPO contracts to criminals (who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would gleefully prey on them, discouraging from free-riding). As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;result you would still have the competition that makes capitalism work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;since users would choose the best of the PPO's capable of participating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in the general defense fund (the super-PPO), and the monopolist part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the system would be reduced to only one aspect of the society. But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't quite be anarchocapitalism anymore.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;--------------------------
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps the PPO defense alliance could be in the same treaty that lets them 
<br>
handle inter-jurisdictional conflict, like when a subscriber of one PPO 
<br>
wrongs the subscriber of another.  The isolated PPO would be seen to be at 
<br>
a huge negotiating disadvantage with the other PPOs, and that PPO will be 
<br>
at a large business disadvantage.
<br>
<p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
