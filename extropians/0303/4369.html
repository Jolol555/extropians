<p><em>&gt; Thanks for this reference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically I think that the diagnosis is pretty accurate but in some ways not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pessimistic enough. However I think that the prescription is both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unrealistic and potentially disastrous both for America and the rest of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4. The article connects the problems posed by WMD to the malfunctioning of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system of sovereign states. The assumption is you need a state to create
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such devices or supply them to crazies such as Al Quaida.
</em><br>
<p>He did mention the possibility of nuclear weapons falling
<br>
into their hands by chance.  I thought that he was more
<br>
worried about rogue states offering cover.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm afraid I am more pessimistic than he is in some ways, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you don't need to be a state or have the backing of one to cause huge havoc,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the interconnected and centralised organisation of our civilisation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this will become truer over time.  My own long-term
<br>
hope to counter this is either (A) a Singularity, or (B)
<br>
The Transparent Society.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 5. My main criticism is this. His solution to the problem is something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called neo-sovereignty, effectively an American Empire (ok a benign hegemony
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you prefer). Why should the second rank powers put up with this? All the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historic precedents suggest that a policy like this will simply produce an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alliance of other lesser powers against the hegemon
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly.  That's what the historical perspective does
<br>
suggest.  But it has been more than 10 years since the 
<br>
U.S.S.R. fell, and so why haven't Japan and Germany 
<br>
re-armed?  To me it's most probable that the unification
<br>
success of the EU can be traced to an inevitable urge on
<br>
their part to be a &quot;player&quot; in the big game.
<br>
<p>Obviously, the more an American administration &quot;cuts corners&quot;
<br>
by not trying to go through the U.N., by not trying as hard
<br>
as it can to woo foreign leaders, then the larger and sooner
<br>
the chances for the emergence of a global challenger.  What
<br>
else explains George Bush being on the telephone day after
<br>
day after day, trying to recruit everyone from Russia to 
<br>
Cameroon to be on board?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; which will raise the costs of such a policy (in every sense)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an unacceptably high level.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand.  (But then, maybe I've been warped by
<br>
growing up knowing that Soviet missiles were aimed at a
<br>
spot only 12 miles from me.)  So what if a benign hegemon
<br>
like the U.S. seizes Iraq?  Maybe next time, the Germans
<br>
and French will seize Bosnia themselves when tragedy strikes.
<br>
&quot;Spheres of Influence&quot; is an old, old reality.
<br>
<p>I wouldn't even be nervous if the E.U. pointed a lot of 
<br>
missiles at the U.S.---you see, I grew up with that.  I'm
<br>
much more afraid that China might act more like Japan or
<br>
Germany than the conservative Russians, when it comes to
<br>
MAD.  You can bet your bottom dollar that if Germany or
<br>
Japan had faced-off another nuclear superpower for 50 years,
<br>
something very bad would have happened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's no good saying &quot;They'll accept it because it's in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest&quot;.  The response is likely to be &quot;Thanks, but no thanks&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  That much is obvious.
<br>
<p>Lee
