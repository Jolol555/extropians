<p>
Steve Davies writes an amazingly long paragraph depicting
<br>
what he infers is the state of mind of people who, I have
<br>
some reason to believe, are political opponents of his.
<br>
<p>Yet you could read his entire post, not just that paragraph,
<br>
and yet remain uncertain of his own position on these issues.
<br>
Where are the usual straw men?  Where are the give-away
<br>
slogans and indictments?  Where is the biased vocabulary?
<br>
<p>I cannot think of anyone else on this list, out of hundreds of
<br>
people, who could write so informatively and yet so objectively.
<br>
<p>That in itself is quite sad.
<br>
<p>(And I can think of only two people I know of, for sure, who
<br>
even appreciate it, or recognize its value at all.)

<em>&gt; Subject: Re: FWD (SK) Fear Inside the Power Elite
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Could you describe their vision?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think their vision [the viewpoint of Wolfowitz and American Vice-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Cheney] is pretty clear, as set out in their various
</em><br>
<em>&gt; publications and in journals such as 'Weekly Standard'. Broadly it is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US (along with other countries in the Anglosphere and a few others)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; represents the values of modernity broadly defined (rationalism, democracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule of law, market economy et al). These face ideological and physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenges from several sources but above all from the combination of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; militant anti-modernity movements such as Islamic fundamentalism and 'failed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states' such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Yemen. The solution cannot be a Pat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Buchanan style withdrawal. Therefore the US has to use the power it has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'sort out' problematic areas of the world and in some sense has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility to do so, given the values it espouses and the position it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finds itself in. The underlying belief is that the us has the opportunity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and duty almost to realise the Enlightenment project of a global
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilisation. There is one division among folks who think this way. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neo-con exponents of this view differ from their New Democrat equivalents in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking the US can do this unilaterally, rather than through international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutions such as the UN. It's Teddy Roosevelt versus Woodrow Wilson
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basically. I think myself that after 9/11 the thinking has gone something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this. &quot;These bastards are after us because they are opposed to our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic principles. The existence of many failed states and the generally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screwed up nature of the Middle East gives them a steady supply of recruits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the chance of getting their hands on some really nasty stuff. We can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depend on corrupt clients to do the work for us - they are part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem anyway. So we have to intervene directly in the ME to lance this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boil and that requires a permanent base in the shape of a country we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reshape as an exemplar. We also can't trust the Saudis any longer. Lets kill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two birds with one stone and knock off Saddam and use Iraq in this way. We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also have to set an example so that no other state even thinks about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing WMD, much less supplying them to the bad guys, that requires a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctrine of preemptive intervention. We can use Iraq as the test case. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Middle East and militant Islam are the major problem for our values so if we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scotch them the main danger is removed&quot;
