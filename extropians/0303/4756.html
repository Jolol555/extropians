I thought some of you might like to see this, it was forwarded to me from a 
<br>
friend.

accepting it.&quot; - Aristotle (again!)

Dear friend,
<br>
<p>I'm writing to ask you to join me in signing a Citizens'
<br>
Declaration reaffirming our commitment to international
<br>
cooperation.
<br>
<p>The outbreak of war is not the end of the fight for 
<br>
peace -- only the beginning. Around the globe, people 
<br>
are joining together in the declaration below. We will
<br>
be announcing it in a press conference on Friday, and 
<br>
we need your help to make it as big as possible.
<br>
<p>Signing up will only take a minute of your time, but it'll
<br>
send a message that the momentum built through our opposition
<br>
to war in Iraq will only keep growing.
<br>
<p>You can sign up at:
<br>
<p>&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.moveon.org/declaration/">http://www.moveon.org/declaration/</a>&quot;&gt;<a href="http://www.moveon.org/declaration/</A">http://www.moveon.org/declaration/</A</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>Here's the text of the Declaration:
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
<p>A CITIZENS' DECLARATION
<br>
<p>As a US-led invasion of Iraq begins, 
<br>
we, the undersigned citizens of many countries,
<br>
reaffirm our commitment to addressing international
<br>
conflicts through the rule of law and the United Nations.
<br>
<p>By joining together across countries and continents,
<br>
we have emerged as a new force for peace.
<br>
As we grieve for the victims of this war,
<br>
we pledge to redouble our efforts to put an end to the Bush
<br>
Administration's doctrine of pre-emptive attack and
<br>
the reckless use of military power.
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
<p>Thank you.
