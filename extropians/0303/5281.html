<p>&quot;Brett, I certainly appreciate your moderation attempt. But hey, you know,
<br>
there is a war going on and there are people here on this list who ardently
<br>
defend this criminal action.&quot;
<br>
<p>First, let me say that in a rare occurence I am in complete agreement with 
<br>
you, Hubert, and that a war is indeed going on. Joking aside, perhaps you 
<br>
could point me to the thread in which you specifically point out how it is 
<br>
that you feel the US is &quot;criminal&quot; before I comment on that further. It is my 
<br>
hope that it is something beyond the fact that the UN or the French have not 
<br>
sanctioned it.
<br>
<p>&quot;As long as there are US patriots on this list
<br>
who defend the law of the strongest and willingly accept the deaths of their
<br>
own soldiers and ten times as much Iraqui *casualties* I will choose any
<br>
ways and means to protest against this point of view.&quot;
<br>
<p>As you are free to do in part because the US had the same sort of attitudes 
<br>
with regard to war with the Nazis. However, this sort of attack on the 
<br>
position held by myself and other &quot;US patriots&quot; and &quot;European patriots&quot; and 
<br>
&quot;Australian patriots&quot; etc. is not helpful and certainly not the best way to 
<br>
change people of opposing viewpoints minds. I could simply oversimplify your 
<br>
position and say, &quot;I will badger Hubert until he and his fellow German 
<br>
patriots accept a position of leadership and responsibility and no longer 
<br>
accept and willingly promote a status quo which leaves in power a brutal 
<br>
dictator that kills hundreds of thousands of his own people. And I will 
<br>
critcize vehemently Hubert's stance which accepts a state of affairs that 
<br>
permits wars of liberation that allows freedom and democracy only for the 
<br>
peoples of Germany and not for those of Iraq.&quot; However, I do not believe that 
<br>
is your position nor is what you describe that of those who support this war. 
<br>
All that being said, the war is going on, and Saddam Hussein and his 
<br>
murdering thugs are going to be removed. So, does it not please you in any 
<br>
sense that he will be gone? Or is it more preferable in your view that he 
<br>
remain in power and arbitrarily kill thousands upon thousands of Iraqis 
<br>
instead of the US inadvertently killing perhaps several hundred in the short 
<br>
term and ultimately saving countless Iraqi lives from his tyranny in the 
<br>
future? 
<br>
<p>&quot;My resort to a common
<br>
visceral reaction was harmless and even POLITE in contrast to the disgusting
<br>
collateral damage our patriots here are willing to accept. I think I must
<br>
resort to a tougher language pretty soon.&quot;
<br>
<p>And our stance is even more polite compared to the disgusting mass and 
<br>
arbitrary killings that you willingly accept by supporting the continued 
<br>
existence of the Saddam Hussein regime, even one that is disarmed. Pol Pot 
<br>
did not need weapons of mass destruction to inflict one of the greatest 
<br>
holocausts of all time on the Cambodian people.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
<br>
<p>&quot;In my opinion, no single European country could guarantee a secure future to 
<br>
its people by its own strength.&quot;
