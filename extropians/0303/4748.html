<em>&gt; &gt;Actually I would describe myself as a Libertarian that knows

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah! A fellow one at last. Which bugs have you found? I've found a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; myself, lets share/trade.
</em><br>
<p>War is a area that illustrates that much libertarian theory is only
<br>
useful when you apply it to an entirely libertarian world (i.e. a
<br>
fictional universe, at present). Strict libertarian theory does little
<br>
to allow one to rationally or effectively deal with a semi- to
<br>
non-libertarian world full of many anti-libertarian actors.
<br>
<p>War, being a rather extreme series of events between groups, and being
<br>
a group activity (i.e. not to be found in a strictly libertarian world)
<br>
exclusively, illustrates this. A strict libertarian would not engage in
<br>
combat against any party which had not directly attacked that
<br>
particular libertarian. This is the heart, and the weakness, of the
<br>
non-initiation of force principle. The problem is that applying such a
<br>
principle to the real world is Pollyannish, as much as any pacifist
<br>
principle is. 
<br>
<p>Evil tyrants do not go away if you ignore them. They do not behave if
<br>
you refuse to hear the cries of others being victimized by such evil.
<br>
They laugh with glee when you boycott them economically, for you give
<br>
their opression legitimacy. When you argue against the use of force to
<br>
make them behave, you are aiding and abetting their opression. When
<br>
they are done opressing others, they will come after you.
<br>
<p>Similarly, strict libertarian theory does not deal well with terrorist
<br>
insurgencies. It is too easy for anti-libertarians in the real world to
<br>
penetrate a libertarian or semi-libertarian society and subvert and
<br>
sabotage it from within with violence and mayhem. See L Neil Smith's
<br>
novel &quot;The American Zone&quot; for a treatment of this (note: there are a
<br>
number of structural weaknesses in the setting of this novel, which
<br>
illustrate other weaknesses of libertarian theory as applied to the
<br>
real world, see if you can spot them).
<br>
<p>Freedom dies when the free refuse to fight for the unfree. It cries
<br>
when the free think that only the free deserve to be free. Freedom
<br>
quickly deserts the free who refuse to take action when tyranny is
<br>
loose upon the world.
