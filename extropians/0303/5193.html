<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; forces intend to go about this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### One option is to set up food and other aid dispensing areas right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outside the city, and invite all civilians to go out and take what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need, while denying this to the military. Young men who come for aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would not be let back into the city and would be diverted to temporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; refugee camps. Women and children returning to the city could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fingerprinted, and issued only enough food for themselves, to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transfers to the military.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Umm, forgive me, but what stops them from getting hijacked by the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pair of strong arms (or AK) that crosses their path?
</em><br>
<p>### Sorry, I should have mentioned that women and children would not be
<br>
*forced* to go back to the city - they could stay in the refugee camps,
<br>
safely with their men, as long as all of them agree not bring guns with
<br>
them. Of course, this would require major amounts of food, and
<br>
investment is infrastructure (including movie screens, and other
<br>
propaganda assets), as well as protection of the people, but this is
<br>
likely to be a small cost compared to having thousands killed as
<br>
bystanders in urban warfare. Also, for PR value, feeding hungry people
<br>
is much better than blowing them up.
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see no way to force _any_ Baathists to act in a humane manner short of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct person-on-person  intervention forcing them to restrict their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior. And that's expensive and probably horrible work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
### Once the bad people are deprived of their human shields, effective
<br>
means of persuasion can be safely brought to bear on them.
<br>
<p>As I was saying before, I am slightly against the war, but once it is
<br>
initiated, it should be effectively and hopefully, cleanly, fought till
<br>
the objective is achieved.
