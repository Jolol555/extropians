<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; It sounds like such a great idea, any reasons

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People already addicted to food would be encouraged
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; shortage which exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in many parts of the world.  
</em><br>
<p>As has been pointed out in countless places, including
<br>
repeatedly on this list before, famine is a
<br>
distribution problem, not a food shortage.  We have so
<br>
much spare food available that people are talking
<br>
about using some of it to replace petroleum fuels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Burning more calories also does nothing to encourage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cardiovascular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; health.  The heart is a muscle and like any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muscle it stays in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tone by the training effect achieved by exercise. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Too much cholesterol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or homocysteine in your system and you still may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have plugged arteries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You may look skinny but still die of a heart attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or stroke.  
</em><br>
<p>True to some extent, though if I understand the
<br>
chemistry right, that which plugs up your arteries
<br>
would slowly diffuse to make up for that which is
<br>
consumed by this device, thus making this not as much
<br>
of a problem.  It won't make a couch potato into an
<br>
athlete, of course, but it's not supposed to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess what I'm saying is the benefits of good diet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and exercise still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has many health benefits that outweigh just having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high metabolism.
</em><br>
<p>Then argue them.  For instance, you might be concerned
<br>
about people not getting the vitamins in green
<br>
vegetables.  Counter: if one need not be worried about
<br>
the calories, one could eat several hamburgers - each
<br>
with its own complement of lettuce (and other
<br>
vegetables) - until one had enough.  (Granted, the
<br>
volume of calorie processing for this approach would
<br>
take either a rather refined device, an impractically
<br>
large device, or a lot of smaller devices, but it
<br>
could be done.  Personally, I'd take the &quot;lot of
<br>
smaller devices&quot; route if I were to do it.)  Even junk
<br>
food usually has at least trace amounts of good
<br>
nutrients.
<br>
<p>The exercise bit is a more solid objection than the
<br>
diet bit, but if people get enough exercise to survive
<br>
(and, honestly, even most obese people *do* move
<br>
around somewhat in a given day), then their lives can
<br>
be lengthened until practical replacements for that
<br>
come along.  Plus, if people need less energy to move
<br>
around, then they are likely to move around a bit
<br>
more, thus getting more exercise than they would while
<br>
loaded down.  (Consider: if you could run around the
<br>
block without breaking a sweat, vs. if you could
<br>
barely drag yourself around the block, winding up
<br>
panting and wheezing and generally very
<br>
uncomfortable...well, in which situation would *you*
<br>
more likely choose to go for a walk?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If people could stay skinny without eating right or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercising the net
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect might be more people dieing prematurely!
</em><br>
<p>Highly doubtful.  Nonzero probability, of course, but
<br>
I would suspect it is far more likely that many more
<br>
lives (or, at least, person-years) would be saved than
<br>
would be lost if this were deployed.
