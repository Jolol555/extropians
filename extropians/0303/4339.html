I should have stated my meaning and standpoint more clearly. From My casual 
<br>
observation and those of the 'general public&quot; types that I have spoken to. 
<br>
Nixon is viewed as somewhat a loon who broke the law while in office. 
<br>
Granted, he also achieved a great deal and these achievements are greatly 
<br>
overshadowed by the events at the end of his Presidency. 
<br>
I will admit that I am far from an expert on the subject as I was too young 
<br>
to care at the time and today it really does not interest me a great deal as 
<br>
I live in the UK. This may go far in explaining my viewpoint or may just be 
<br>
fuel for an Ad-Hominem attack.
<br>
<p>My view of the current President is that he was not elected by the people and 
<br>
should never have made it to the white house. 
<br>
<p>This is all an aside as my original post was simply a question as to &quot;how do 
<br>
you remove a person from elected office in the US?&quot; My question was in order 
<br>
to give me a better understanding of what safety guards are in place to stop 
<br>
someone like Any President from doing something utterly mad? For example, 
<br>
breaking international law, Illegally invading another country or even 
<br>
forcing the country to follow a course of action that is against the wishes 
<br>
of the majority of the public and could conceivably start a second cold war.
<br>
<p>Glean from this question what you will. Undoubtedly I am against the war in 
<br>
Iraq. However this does not by definition make me Anti American or Pro 
<br>
Saddam, far from it.

<em>&gt; &quot;The worrying thing is that on casual observation. If a complete loon is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I often stress the need for historical perspective during my replies on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this forum, and I dare say that has never been more appropriate than in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard to this post. There's nothing I enjoy better than hit and run &quot;Evil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nixon the mad tyrant loon harbinger of global destruction makes Hitler look 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Little Mary Sunshine&quot; discussions. I do not mean to suggest that Alex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies all of those descriptions, but he obviously subscribes to a few.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Before fully getting into this subject, perhaps Alex would be kind enough 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fully elaborate on his position on the 37th President. Perhaps it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully thought out, but I tend to think the influence of thirty years of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;impartial&quot; sources such as Walter Cronkite have played a role in his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description of Nixon as a &quot;loon.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me say that the record of Richard Nixon is a complex one and cannot be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; summed up in a cute MTV style one sentence quip. It can be successfully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argued that no post- WWII president had a more lasting and important 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive impact on the United States than President Nixon. This is the same 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man who initiated rapprochement with the Chinese, a move that not only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altered Soviet defense expenditures and strategy, but helped to make them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the isolated spreader of &quot;worldwide revolution&quot;.
