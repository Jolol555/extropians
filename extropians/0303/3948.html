Thanks to Max Rasmussen for pointing out three eye-opening URLs:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.netnomad.com/f-reviews/nytrev.html">http://www.netnomad.com/f-reviews/nytrev.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Some excerpts:
<br>
<p>If famine and war seem to be the fate of African nations, those heart-wrenching full-page newspaper ads, television commercials and
<br>
direct-mail solicitations are our response. But Michael Maren warns you to resist letting your heart strings pull your pocketbook.
<br>
Aid is not only ''incompetent and inadvertently destructive,'' he concludes in ''The Road to Hell.'' ''It could be positively
<br>
evil.''
<br>
<p>Mr. Maren, a magazine journalist, knows whereof he muckrakes. He first went to Africa in the Peace Corps, in 1977. Then, thinking
<br>
that he might be able to make a difference, he stayed and worked with some of the most reputedly humanitarian of the humanitarian
<br>
organizations; most of the time he worked in Somalia. With that experience, supplemented by years of exploring the subject of
<br>
humanitarian aid as a journalist, he has concluded that the billions of dollars spent on alleviating famine and helping refugees
<br>
have made people dependent on food aid, discouraging them from growing their own and destroying communities and cultures in the
<br>
process. Aid has driven local pharmacies out of business, unable to compete with free drugs given by large American companies. And
<br>
it has perpetuated refugee camps, instead of encouraging people to return to their homes.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>Mr. Maren focuses most of his damning details on CARE and Save the Children. It will be argued, of course, that it is not fair to
<br>
taint all humanitarian organizations because of the transgressions of a few. Sadly, however, the performance of those two groups is
<br>
representative, as anyone who has seen the aid agencies at work in the field knows. During the refugee crises in Rwanda, for
<br>
example, more than 100 humanitarian groups invaded, creating the most indecorous scenes of public relations officers shoving and
<br>
pushing to get their group on television or into a newspaper, and bad-mouthing the work of competing charities.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://hallbusinesses.com/biographies_primers/1000.shtml">http://hallbusinesses.com/biographies_primers/1000.shtml</a>
</em><br>
<p>From Booklist , December 1, 1996
<br>
Maren attacks the bureaucratic tangles through which foreign aid is channeled. Drawing on two decades of experience in East Africa,
<br>
Maren directs his criticism at the corruption of good intentions. He starts with his Peace Corps job in Kenya, proceeds to his work
<br>
for Catholic Relief Services, and then for USAID in Somalia. Western altruism failed most completely in Somalia, Maren argues,
<br>
because the aid spigot washed away the local economy, which degenerated into a kleptocracy. Assistance rarely reached the intended
<br>
recipients; most was stolen, an unpleasant fact the author maintains aid organizations squelched out of self-interest, lest their
<br>
own survival (on charitable and government largesse) be imperiled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://web.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v1/1/5.htm">http://web.africa.ufl.edu/asq/v1/1/5.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>According to Maren, relief aid to Somalia in the 1980s and 1990s was manipulated by local authorities, hoodlums, and even refugees
<br>
who grew rich diverting food and other donations or by using these resources for political ends. Despite this, Western aid agencies
<br>
continued to solicit funds and carry out relief and development activities because they benefited financially.
<br>
<p>Well, notice that the logic Maren uses also accounts
<br>
for the results of urban welfare programs in the U.S.
<br>
too.  Maren &quot;concluded that the billions of dollars spent
<br>
on alleviating famine and helping refugees have made
<br>
people dependent...&quot; and discourages them from dealing
<br>
productively and creatively with their own situations.
<br>
<p>(But here, as opposed to there, the incentive is not
<br>
stealing dollars, but buying votes.)
