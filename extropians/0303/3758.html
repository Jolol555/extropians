<em>&gt; &gt; See my other post on this point. We need to increase funding by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; growing and presenting demand for improvements in real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-aging medicine.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some of us, esp. David Kekich and Aubrey de Grey are trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do this (each based on their own expertise, David with TransVio
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and Aubrey with his structuring of the fall IABG conference).
</em><br>
<p>There's certainly a bunch of people talking...needs to be more cross-talk,
<br>
though. The communities need to discover each other, collaborate and share.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Realistically, assuming that the US and more governments manage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to shut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down all avenues of anti-aging research, we're looking at minor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; medical technologies becoming available in ten years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US will not shut it down.  I've just recently had a long conversation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Natasha about how to prioritize ExI efforts.  Unknown to most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the fact that China is going &quot;over the edge&quot; with regard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This was documented in a recent Nature article and I've had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal confirmations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (We are talking more money than the principle investigators know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how to effectively spend...).
</em><br>
<p>&lt;laughter&gt; Would that I ever find myself in that situation...but that's
<br>
heartening to hear. You have any URLs for articles?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I have made the argument that GM crops cannot be stopped -- anti-aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research cannot be stopped as well.  As Spock so well observed in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Star Trek II: &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few... or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one&quot;.  The &quot;deathist&quot; bioethicists will fail.
</em><br>
<p>Stopped no, slowed down yes. Irrespective of final effect, I don't think we
<br>
should miss this chance to build up our own strength and position by
<br>
opposing something so easy to oppose. As has been pointed out, Kass makes a
<br>
wonderful villain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My conclusion (and suggestion to Natasha) is that ExI should not focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too much energy on dealing with anti-stem-cell/cloning efforts.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a question of inertia -- opinions in the U.S. or Europe are only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to have a limited impact on global inertia.
</em><br>
<p>Well, a bunch of us orgs are stomping on ahead with the opposition in any
<br>
case. Why leave it to China if you could have the US and China working at
<br>
it? I'm not confident enough of results happening fast enough to let things
<br>
ride. Who knows what parts of anti-aging medicine could turn out to be far
<br>
more expensive and complex (= add another 5 years of research) than we knew?
<br>
I think that the struggle against AIDS shows plenty of precedent for moments
<br>
like that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is conditional on us winning the war of memes with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deathist bioethicists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If they convince the world that no-one should have anti-aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, that it's immoral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and unimportant, that it will be legislated against, then the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markets will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; never come into being. The research will never happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Highly unlikely to happen.  I'll cite everything from personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the Ellison Medical Foundation) to the cultural self-interest (see China
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above).  We can be very annoyed with any deathists but they aren't going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to win in the long run (they would have to eliminate our instincts for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival).
</em><br>
<p>I think you're right in the *long* term, but the 20th century has had many
<br>
places and times in which progress towards a generally desired ideal was
<br>
blocked or subverted for decades. The long term could easily be postmortem
<br>
for many of us. It's a big existential risk -- we shouldn't sit back and
<br>
take it while we can fight.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So I see the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as being a lack of funding, rather than a failing of human nature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed!  I would only make a slight modification that one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major reasons for the lack of funding is that most people think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problems cannot be solved -- we didn't go to the moon until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we went to the moon.  In many respects what is lacking is someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying &quot;let us go to the moon&quot;.  Aging may be somewhat more complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than going to the moon but it isn't *that* much more complex.
</em><br>
<p>I also think that there's a more suble case of mistaken thinking going on.
<br>
This is from my many discussions with non-technical people-in-the-street.
<br>
Most people my age and younger accept that medical technology can make you
<br>
live longer -- it's on the level of obvious thinking for them. However, they
<br>
fall into Tithonus belief; that living longer wouldn't be worth it, as you
<br>
would just be old and crippled for longer. I'd say an easy 70% of the people
<br>
I talk to think that way.
