<p><em>&gt; &gt; what percentage of people in the world&quot; do you think &quot;think &quot;?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe the question should be rephrased as:  &quot;What percentage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the population thinks about things important to our collective
</em><br>
<p>[gasp!]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; future, and how much of that brainmatter is devoted to putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those thoughts into action?&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>I agree that this is a good question, but I disagree 
<br>
with its presumptions.  For me, it's far from clear
<br>
how wise it is for most people to excessively ponder
<br>
times and places about which they understand very
<br>
little.
<br>
<p>Recall the bromide, &quot;Think globally, act locally&quot;.  I'd suggest
<br>
instead, &quot;Think locally, act locally&quot;.  The most extensive
<br>
treatment of the question I've found is in Thomas Sowell's
<br>
&quot;Knowledge and Decisions&quot;, though the emphasis is on economic
<br>
decisions.
<br>
<p>Now it's one thing to be extremely curious about our universe
<br>
in any of its manifold dimensions, historical, psychological,
<br>
scientific, political, and so on.  It's another entirely to
<br>
become wrapped up in economic and political question to the
<br>
extend that you feel it to be one of the most important thing
<br>
in your life that you participate, and, if possible, determine
<br>
the fates of millions of people thousands of miles away.
<br>
<p>Consider for example that 50 million people voted for George
<br>
Bush.  Suppose that a mere one out of 20 of these people are
<br>
so consumed with their own feelings about the way he's being
<br>
treated in the world press that they want to engage in the
<br>
&quot;action&quot; you are apparently advocating.  This would mean
<br>
two and a half MILLION people taking to the streets and deluging
<br>
their representatives with demonstrations and demands.  Then, if
<br>
only one in 20 of the 50 million people who voted against Mr. Bush
<br>
do the same thing, a total of five million people vigorously
<br>
&quot;acting&quot; in the name of one cause or another.
<br>
<p>A citizen interested in politics or in exercising his or her
<br>
duty to contribute to the democratic process probably should
<br>
restrict themselves to writing letters, engaging in discussions,
<br>
and voting.  And the best way to do that, IMO, is to identify
<br>
those professionals whose general outlook most closely matches
<br>
your own, and listen very carefully to what they say.
