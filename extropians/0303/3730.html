From: Joao Magalhaes [mailto:<a href="mailto:joao.magalhaes@fundp.ac.be?Subject=RE:%20Why%20will%20we%20reach%20the%20singularity?">joao.magalhaes@fundp.ac.be</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; I've been wondering on why are transhumanists so confident 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we will reach the singularity. 
</em><br>
<p>Joao, this is a great question.  I wonder the same thing myself on a
<br>
regular basis.
<br>
<p>Personally I don't like the term &quot;singularity&quot;.  It's rather
<br>
apocalyptic and not particularly descriptive.
<br>
<p>That having been said, it seems to me that there are three things that
<br>
many extropians would accept as signs of the so-called singularity.
<br>
<p>1) Self-replicating molecular nanotechnology
<br>
<p>2) Human uploads
<br>
<p>3) Non-upload AI with greater than human general intelligence
<br>
<p>No one has shown me compelling evidence that any of these will be
<br>
developed in the next 50 years.  Of all of these I think uploads are
<br>
the most likely to occur in that time, at around 2050.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the end, I would say that the basis for the singularity is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moore's law.
</em><br>
<p>More generally - it's the accelerating ability of mankind to
<br>
manipulate information, and the potentially recursive nature of this
<br>
ability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet I'm sure there are physical limits for Moore's law. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When will we reach them? Can you be sure Moore's law will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue for long enough to develop a smarter-than-man 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial intelligence?
</em><br>
<p>I think you're mixing a few questions here.
<br>
<p>1) What's the physical limit of computational density?
<br>
<p>2) With computers at that limit can we develop AIs or uploads?
<br>
<p>3) At what rate will we push towards that limit?
<br>
<p>My answers:
<br>
<p>1) FORESEEABLE COMPUTING POWER - The combination of shrinking circuits
<br>
to what we currently consider the physical limits and then moving to a
<br>
3 dimensional design for processors seems to give us around a factor
<br>
of 10^10 more computing power than today, or around 10^19 ops / second
<br>
in a PC, or 10^22 ops / second in a supercomputer.  I'm being pretty
<br>
casual here and just assuming that we can move feature sizes down to
<br>
.01 microns and build independent circuit layers of that size and
<br>
stack them on top of each other.  Other techniques may in fact take us
<br>
far past this level.
<br>
<p>2) COMPUTING POWER NECESSARY FOR AI / UPLOADS - I'm a bit of a
<br>
pessimist on simulating the human brain compared to many posters on
<br>
this list.   My own estimate is that it'll take around 10^20 ops /
<br>
second.  That's basically 10^14 synapses, up to 100hz signals, 100x
<br>
oversampling, and 100 instructions to simulate each timeslice at each
<br>
synapse.  This is close enough to my naïve projection of feasible
<br>
computing power that I conclude that we will indeed be able to run a
<br>
human or human-equivalent mind on such a device.
<br>
<p>3) RATE OF COMPUTING POWER GROWTH - At the current rate of growth,
<br>
we'll reach 10^20 ops / second in a PC-analogous device around 2050.
<br>
But will the current rate of growth hold?  That's the gazillion dollar
<br>
question.  The problem with Moore's Law is that it's a purely
<br>
empirical observation.  There's no underlying theory for *why*
<br>
computing power increases at that rate.  Kurzweil argues that since
<br>
the rate of computing power has increased at the same rate for 5
<br>
successive computing technologies, that it should continue at the same
<br>
rate into future technologies that we'll need to use to achieve that
<br>
10^20 or so ops / second.  That's very comforting, but it's not a
<br>
sound argument.  History is full of examples of technologies that
<br>
followed an S-curve - progressing exponentially for some time and then
<br>
slowing or even tapering off.  
<br>
<p>No one has shown me why Moore's Law must continue at the same rate.
<br>
Kurzweil believes that Moore's Law is accelerating, but I haven't seen
<br>
any evidence to support this position either.  I have every confidence
<br>
that mankind will reach those 10^20 ops / second individual devices at
<br>
some point, but exactly when that will occur seems to be a topic more
<br>
for speculation than for rigorous argument today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I found transhumanism, already several years ago, I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought it set an optimistic but plausible scenario. Now, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm starting to wonder if we're not just another cult 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to sacrifice reality towards a fairer image of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world. Please prove me wrong. 
</em><br>
<p>I think there's certainly this tendency to *want* to see one's own
<br>
favorite utopia in the future. 
<br>
<p>Personally, I think the best kind of transhumanist activity is the
<br>
kind that helps *create* the future we want to see.  There are any
<br>
number of routes to do that.  You, Anders, and others on this list are
<br>
engaged in direct research aligned with transhumanist goals.  Robert
<br>
and I have both spent time, energy, and money trying to bring this
<br>
kind of research into the commercial realm.  Damien, the betterhumans
<br>
folks, and others have spent their time educating the public.  All of
<br>
these activities increase the extropy of the world.  So, rather than
<br>
worry too much about things that we *can't* affect, I suggest we all
<br>
remain focused on the individual contributions that we *can* make to
<br>
global extropy.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
