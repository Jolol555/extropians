<p><em>&gt; ----- Original Message -----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: &quot;Hal Finney&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=RE:%20Spacetime/Inflation/Civilizations">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Suppose we are going to flip a biased quantum coin, one which has a 90%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance of coming up heads.  We will generate the good or bad experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; depending on the outcome of the coin flip.  I claim that it is obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is better to give the good experience when we get the 90% outcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the bad experience when we get the 10% outcome.  That's the assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I will start with.
</em><br>
<p>I read this as asserting that it is better to flip such a coin
<br>
than to take an action that causes no experiences to transpire
<br>
at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### One way of avoiding the conundrum is to use Rawl's veil of ignorance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; put yourself in the position of the experimental subject, and consider one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional option - not flipping the coin at all. You can decide to run the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good experience only, giving the test subject a certainty of good experience
</em><br>
<p>In other words, forget about the coin, and just proceed straight
<br>
to the generous and kind choice of supplying a beneficial
<br>
experience with 100% probability.  Well... of course this &quot;avoids&quot;
<br>
the conundrum, and also thereby ignores its lesson.
<br>
<p>You're quite right that this would be the more moral choice, but
<br>
we don't learn anything from it.  The real question is, should you
<br>
flip this coin, thereby causing its attendant consequences, or
<br>
should you by default cause nothing to occur?
<br>
<p>Now change the polarity so that in 90% of the cases the subject
<br>
will have a bad experience, and in only ten a good experience.
<br>
Should the coin be flipped in this case, or is the default
<br>
(nothing occurs) to be preferred?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In level III there is the additional wrinkle of your actions causally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influencing the quantum evolution of the whole experimental system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically, when making the decision you decohere into three versions, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sheaves of histories - the no-coin-flip, the choose-90% and choose-10%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; histories (the last sheaf of  histories is equivalent to you turning into a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sadist, I think). Your subjective experience of making the decision is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent of a quantum process of decoherence, whose outcomes will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different measures depending on the properties of the system (your brain).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your brain is influenced by my words, on the classical level, it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accompanied by an increase in the measure of branches with the no-coin-flip
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment on the MWI, or level III analysis.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Because you have benevolently assumed that the &quot;no coin flip&quot;
<br>
option results in the same circumstances for the subject as the
<br>
favorable outcome does.  Isn't that right?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this case the conclusion is still the same as in level I and II,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should skip the flip and choose good, in accordance with Tegmark's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement that level III does not increase the number of distinct entities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or types of particle configurations) compared to level I and II.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be also an infinite number of level I copies of you decohering into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the three sheaves, but without a direct causal relationship to each other.
</em><br>
<p>How does the conclusion depend on which level we are discussing?
<br>
(Although I do appreciate you clarifying what physically happens.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My intuition is to give the sentiences you are responsible for the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience you can give them, if you decide to produce them, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decision to run them should be also acceptable to the sentiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves - if you know that they will not be willing to live and be happy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even with the best you can offer, you should not make them at all.
</em><br>
<p>That seems quite correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As aside to Lee, you are also not duty-bound to make them in first place.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  Nor is one duty-bound to aid drowning swimmers,
<br>
or victims one comes across by chance in traffic accidents.
<br>
(Aside to Dr. Smigrodzki: are *you* duty-bound by the laws
<br>
of your state or country to go to their aid?)
<br>
<p>It's simply not my responsibility whether or not someone
<br>
drowns who I happen to notice while walking along the beach.
<br>
Nonetheless, I adamantly claim that one *ought* to help out
<br>
when one can.  But it is by no means an obligation or duty,
<br>
especially in a free country.
<br>
<p>But suppose that I could press a button here on my desk, and
<br>
a random human being who happens to live about 10^10^29 meters
<br>
from here gets a new copy going among us.  Let me further state
<br>
that he or she will neither be a burden nor an asset to the
<br>
rest of humanity in the new location, but will---after a 
<br>
relatively short time of disorientation---come to experience
<br>
great happiness among us.
<br>
<p>Then it's very clear that I *ought* to press that button
<br>
(even though I concede that I am under no obligation to do
<br>
so).  It wouldn't surprise me if Hal were to come up with
<br>
another ingenious experiment that proves it.
<br>
<p>Lee
