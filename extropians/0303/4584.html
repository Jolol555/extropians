<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20Iraq:%20Re:%20My%20Blind%20Spot">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a> writes: I wonder if Powell had become President whether 
<br>
those getting great emotional satisfaction from trashing U.S. foreign policy 
<br>
would be making jokes about blacks?  Think so?  Or is that verboten, while 
<br>
Texans are fair game?
<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you are right.  Actually they think Texans are fair game.  
<br>
Going back to Powell for an example -- the &quot;Hate America First&quot; crowd would 
<br>
make jokes based on the typical and objectionable stereotype of the American 
<br>
black.  They would never understand the social subtleties that make Powell a 
<br>
member of an entirely different group.  The same goes for President Bush.  
<br>
President Bush apparently lives in Texas by choice and is very proud of the 
<br>
state but insofar as I know he is a long way from being a stereotypical 
<br>
Texan.  His parents were from the Northeast, he was educated in prep schools 
<br>
in the Northeast and he has an MBA from Harvard.  But to repeat, he does seem 
<br>
to genuinely prefer Texas and Texans as his choice of abode as well as 
<br>
friends.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Lee, you went straight to the core of the problem.  The Hate 
<br>
America First crowd is not prepared to deal with us on the basis of reality.  
<br>
They make up a fantasy and then expect us to agree with their delusions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at what Humania is saying about the Patriot Act.  The Act if ever 
<br>
enacted as presented to us by the ACLU is a monstrosity.  But the idea the 
<br>
thing will ever see the light of day as a law is someone's pipe dream.  If 
<br>
they think that monstrosity will ever stand the immediate court challenges, 
<br>
should it get passed into law, then they are not having a pipe dream they are 
<br>
on hashish.  But Humania either doesn't know enough about the American system 
<br>
to know that or he prefers to pretend so.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same goes for Artillo and his representation of President Bush in 
<br>
Texas dialect.  Artillo did a good job of spelling the common idea of what 
<br>
that dialect sounds like but it has nothing to do with reality.
