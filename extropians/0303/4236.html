I wanted to explain and comment on the paper by Groves and Ledyard
<br>
that I mentioned in another thread, Optimal Allocation of Public
<br>
Goods (<a href="http://www.finney.org/~hal/GrovesLedyard.pdf">http://www.finney.org/~hal/GrovesLedyard.pdf</a>, temporarily).
<br>
This paper shows how a government can provide public goods at what is
<br>
called a Pareto-optimal level, which means in effect that you can't
<br>
improve the situation for anyone unless you make someone else worse off.
<br>
That's generally considered about as good as you can do in economic terms.
<br>
It's what the market achieves for private goods.  Being able to do the
<br>
same thing for public goods means that the government is doing its job
<br>
about as well as is theoretically possible.
<br>
<p>First let me describe what is meant by a public good.  Public goods are
<br>
one of the main justifications for governments.  Basically these are
<br>
goods which can't be provided in an efficient manner by markets because
<br>
of the &quot;free rider&quot; problem.  They are goods which people can get benefit
<br>
from even when other people are paying for them.  An example would be
<br>
clean air.  If the government takes steps to clean the air, everyone
<br>
breathes easier.  A private company can't sell outdoor air-cleaning
<br>
technology because few would buy it.  Even though the purchaser would
<br>
gain a benefit by making his own air a little cleaner, most of the
<br>
benefit goes to everyone else who also breathes the clean air.
<br>
<p>Another example of a public good is national defense - if your nation
<br>
has a nuclear deterrent then everyone is protected, not just the
<br>
people who paid for it.  Many environmental issues are public goods,
<br>
such as ocean pollution or species depletion; likewise, scientific and
<br>
medical research that is public funded.  Wei Dai proposed (in effect,
<br>
this is my interpretation anyway) that if copyright can't be protected
<br>
technologically, that information goods may become public goods.
<br>
When someone produces a song or movie or novel, everyone gets it, not
<br>
just the person who paid for it.
<br>
<p>Again, the problem with public goods is that people prefer to be &quot;free
<br>
riders&quot;.  They would rather that someone else pays for the good and they
<br>
can enjoy it for free.  Napster and its offshoots exemplify free riding.
<br>
Of course if nobody pays, there are no goods.  In practice, some people
<br>
will still pay, for various reasons.  But economically speaking you can
<br>
show that the total amount of the good being produced is less than would
<br>
be collectively desired.  In principle you could take some money from the
<br>
consumers and give it to the producers to make more goods, and everyone
<br>
would be happier - the consumers would get more value in new goods than
<br>
they lost in money, and the producers could afford to make more goods.
<br>
This means that the standard outcome is not Pareto optimal and is an
<br>
economic failure.
<br>
<p>Governments try to solve the problem by taxing people and spending the
<br>
money on public goods.  They don't do that for music, yet, but they
<br>
do for national defense and the environment and other public goods.
<br>
The problem is, how does government decide how much should be spent
<br>
on each good?  How much should we be spending on national defense or
<br>
environmental protection?  Everyone has a different opinion.  We use
<br>
voting to come up with a crude measure, but representational government
<br>
has many flaws of its own which have been widely analyzed.
<br>
<p>Groves and Ledyard (GL for short) present an alternative approach, which
<br>
is a fixed mathematical formula which could be used to fund public goods.
<br>
Every taxpayer specifies a value for how much of each public good to
<br>
buy on his behalf.  Based on these amounts, the government uses a simple
<br>
formula to purchase the public goods, and a somewhat more complex formula
<br>
to lay taxes, which are enough to fund the goods.  The government could
<br>
be replaced by a computer, unswayed by lobbyists or special interests,
<br>
which would perform this very mechanical calculation.
<br>
<p>So here's the GL formula in more detail.  To start with, each person
<br>
specifies amounts M that they want the government to spend on their
<br>
behalf for each public good.  The government will then add up the amounts
<br>
everyone chose, and those sums are how much is spent on each good.  Now,
<br>
some people may not want as much to be spent as the sum of everyone
<br>
else's wants, so the M values can be negative.  For each good, the M
<br>
values are added, positive and negative, and the final result is the
<br>
amount to be spent on that good.
<br>
<p>That's simple enough so far.  The fancy part comes with how the taxes are
<br>
calculated, which also depends on the M values.  The taxes have two parts.
<br>
The first part is that each person pays his share of the total amount of
<br>
public spending.  For simplicity we'll assume that this is an even split.
<br>
So if there are one million taxpayers, each has to pay one millionth of
<br>
the sum of all the M values in taxes.
<br>
<p>Then there is a compensation factor in the taxes, which works like this.
<br>
For each good, calculate the mean of the M values for everyone else,
<br>
and call that u.  Calculate the standard deviation of the M values for
<br>
everyone else, and call that s.  Then each person has to pay an additional
<br>
tax whose value is (M-u)^2 - s^2.  This is summed for each public good.
<br>
<p>Now, let me explain how this works.  The idea is that (M-u)^2 is a measure
<br>
of how far your own M value is from the average, u.  The farther you are
<br>
from the average, the more tax you'll have to pay.  However we subtract
<br>
s^2, aka the variance, which is high for goods where there is a wide
<br>
spread of M values and low for goods where there is a narrow spread.
<br>
So if you are far from the mean, the penalty is not so bad for goods
<br>
where there is a high variance, which makes sense because then everyone
<br>
else is far from the mean too.  The worst case is where almost everyone
<br>
agrees about the M value, meaning that the variance is low, but you're
<br>
way different, so your (M-u)^2 value is high.  Then you have to pay the
<br>
biggest penalty.
<br>
<p>Another thing to note is that (M-u)^2 - s^2 can be negative.  In that
<br>
case it reduces your tax instead of adding to it.  This will be true for
<br>
people whose M value is exceptionally close to the average.  For them,
<br>
(M-u)^2 is less than s^2 and so this term reduces their tax for that good.
<br>
And a final thing to note is that this correction term sums to zero
<br>
across all taxpayers, so the total amount of money raised by the taxes
<br>
comes only from the first part of the taxation, which was the simple
<br>
split of the expenditures.  Therefore the government's budget is balanced.
<br>
<p>The main point of the GL system is that people whose M values are far
<br>
from the average pay a penalty, and people whose M values are very close
<br>
to the average get a bonus.  Everyone has to take this into consideration
<br>
when choosing their M values.
<br>
<p>Ideally, the social task of each person choosing M values happens
<br>
collectively, with full information.  Imagine that everyone gets a
<br>
little controller with a dial they can turn to set their M value, which
<br>
remember is the amount &quot;extra&quot; (positive or negative) they want spent on
<br>
a particular public good.  In real time, a computer is constantly adding
<br>
up the total M values and is displaying two things to each person: the
<br>
total amount which will be spent on the public good, and the amount of
<br>
tax the person is going to have to pay based on his current dial setting.
<br>
Turning the dial to the right slightly increases the total amount which
<br>
will be spent (not much, though, if there are thousands or millions of
<br>
voters), and also changes the amount of tax which that person will have
<br>
to pay.  The tax will be minimized when the dial is set at roughly the
<br>
mean value of everyone else's choice, and will go up as the knob turns
<br>
left or right from that position.  Each person has to trade off their
<br>
desire to influence the amount spent on the public good against their
<br>
willingness to pay taxes to make their voice heard.
<br>
<p>That's basically how the GL system works.  It's a little complicated,
<br>
especially the taxation formula.  And keep in mind that all the public
<br>
goods have to be done at once, so you could increase one good's M value
<br>
while decreasing another and keep your taxes in balance, that kind
<br>
of thing.  But I think with some computer help it might be manageable.
<br>
In practice there are probably some few goods you care about and a
<br>
larger number that you don't.  For the second category you can just
<br>
set a policy to minimize your tax burden associated with those goods,
<br>
and focus your energy on trying to influence the spending on the goods
<br>
you are interested in.
<br>
<p>It may seem that the GL system is fundamentally unfair, in that it in
<br>
effect rewards conformists and punishes dissidents.  The farther you
<br>
are from the mean, relative to everyone else, the more you have to pay.
<br>
But in a way, the problem is more with the nature of public goods
<br>
than the GL system itself.  Since they will be consumed collectively,
<br>
and purchased in that same way, people who depart from the consensus
<br>
get penalized.  Those who have very different opinions about spending
<br>
from everyone else can't have their preferences win.  In order for this
<br>
effect to be reflected in the economics, this must be manifest as a cost
<br>
laid on dissenters.  Each person can then make their own decision about
<br>
how much of a cost they are willing to pay to try to influence society
<br>
away from its average value.
<br>
<p>If we do have to have public goods, then it seems to me that a
<br>
technologically based system like this would be worth experimenting with.
<br>
It may not be able to replace all of the functions of government (like
<br>
setting policies and deciding what activities should be legal), but for
<br>
the purposes of funding public goods, it would have many advantages.
<br>
With the aid of computer interfaces and possibly some simplifications
<br>
to the full formulas in the GL paper, it might be practical to begin
<br>
using such a system within a few years.
