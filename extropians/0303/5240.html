<p>[Various descriptions of IRAQI Civilian casualties snipped]
<br>
<p>Humania,
<br>
<p>Its unfortunate for the members of society who support the effort to remove
<br>
the murderous dictator Saddam Hussain from power that the 200,000 -
<br>
1,000,000 people he executed, killed, raped, or tortured were not
<br>
videotaped, since apparently it takes a photograph or personalized narrative
<br>
for the true impact of the horror of the loss of a life to sink in to some
<br>
people.  For all the descriptions you post of Iraqi civilian causalties,
<br>
there are a thousand stories untold, unphotographed, and unvideotaped from
<br>
Saddam's reign of terror.  I wonder how the current vote of the MTV
<br>
counterculture would have fared had these attrocities been videotaped.
<br>
<p>Your postings do nothing to dissuade those who support the ousting of this
<br>
murderous dictator, except to remind us of the type of horrors he had
<br>
intentionally inflicted upon his own people for the past decades.
