<p>Uh, wait.  Western Europe is one of the places where a great 
<br>
number of people are quite upset with us.  Don't try to hide 
<br>
behind Europe's skirt.  And don't try to assume that only 
<br>
murderous religious fanatics really hate us or that people who 
<br>
say they do are afraid of harm from same.  This is contemptible 
<br>
rhetoric.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Images of flag burning mobs sell newspapers.  Peace
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; a number of rallies in support of military action
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; press.  By extrapolation, I must conclude that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion that much of the world is anti-west is an
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Sigh. Do you think you have explained or dealt with anything 
<br>
that is real in the above?  They are not &quot;anti-west&quot;.  They are 
<br>
not even &quot;anti-American&quot;.  They are very much anti some current 
<br>
US and Bristish governmental policies and actions.  So am I.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One can imagine a number of Iraqis and others in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; middle east desperately hoping for a US-led rescue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq must have its own budding young capitalists, its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frustrated intellectuals, its flaming athiests, feminists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sexual revolutionaries, internet users, oppressed gays,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technophiles, classic liberals, hippies, libertarians,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progressives, its own extropians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You can imagine whatever you wish.  But if we do not deal with 
<br>
the very real threats to peace and to our &gt;human dreams the 
<br>
current policies of the US represent all of us will suffer, and 
<br>
not from terrorists either.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; All these would yearn for a more western society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Add them together and it *might* constitute a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrified majority in these oppressed countries.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let us not assume the world hates the west.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Frankly I certainly do not yearn to live in a society that 
<br>
thinks it is ok to threaten the entire world with preemptive 
<br>
strikes at its sole discretion.  I do not yearn to live in a 
<br>
society that locks away 1% or more of its people and most of 
<br>
them for &quot;crimes&quot; which are nothing of the kind.  I do not yearn 
<br>
to live in a society that directly and indirectly takes away 75% 
<br>
of what I earn to fund the destruction of my own freedom and 
<br>
wellbeing and that of others around the world.  I do not yearn 
<br>
to live in a society that thinks it can and should outlaw any 
<br>
and all forms of science and technology that it finds a little 
<br>
scary.  I don't yearn to live in a country that claims the right 
<br>
to seize everything I own without trial, detain me indefinitely 
<br>
without trial and without charges and without defense anytime it 
<br>
decides it disapproves of me or anything and anyone I have ever 
<br>
helped in any way that it defines as &quot;terrorist&quot;.  But I do live 
<br>
in such a country.  And I have decided to stay here and fight 
<br>
the destruction of all that is truly good here for as long as I can.
<br>
<p>If these things listed above are part of what you consider 
<br>
&quot;western society&quot; then I doubt very much many yearn for it any 
<br>
more than I do.  Yes, there are many, many good and wonderful 
<br>
things also about western society.  But it is not those we are 
<br>
hated for and it is high time that people got off their fatuous 
<br>
&quot;patriotic&quot; high horse long enough to admit it and to do 
<br>
something about it before it is much too late for us all.
