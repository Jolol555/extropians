<p>I don't follow you reasoning here Rafal. Would you not see the Bush
<br>
administrations decision to go to war without a Security Council resolution
<br>
and against resolution 1441 (which puts the decision as to when the
<br>
&quot;one final opportunity&quot; is up in the hands of the Security Council) as
<br>
against a trend to World Government? Seems to me to be a very
<br>
substantial poke in the eye for international law, may even set it back
<br>
50 plus years.
<br>
<p>If the US steps away from multilaterally toward a series of bilateral
<br>
agreements wouldn't you expect the global economy to be less efficient
<br>
and that this might effect the role out times of technologies you might
<br>
wish to avail yourself of?
<br>
<p>Personally I find it difficult to forget that it is the same Presidential
<br>
administration that seems to be countenancing stepping away from the
<br>
UN that is also trying so hard to ban embryonic stem cell research
<br>
wherever it can. Maybe the coupling is irrelevant and coincidental.
