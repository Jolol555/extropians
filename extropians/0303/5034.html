<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worst fate, then they logically must do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can to circumvent this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Anything&quot;?  You are putting forth the interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thesis that any act is justified in order to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losing a war.  There are pluses to this view, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minuses.
</em><br>
<p>nah, it depends on what loosing the war means to the
<br>
people.  And I'm not sure what you intend with the
<br>
word &quot;justified&quot;.  I get &quot;To demonstrate or prove to
<br>
be just, right, or valid&quot; for justify from the
<br>
dictionary.  I certainly was not claiming it right or
<br>
just, but that it is what they must do to prevent
<br>
losing.  So again it routes back to what is to be lost
<br>
from the war.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; On the plus side, should the U.S. have subverted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allegedly democratically elected governments in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order to thwart the U.S.S.R.'s plans, should the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British have killed a number of innocent people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a number of wars just to prevent an fleet of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ships from falling into enemy hands?  Should a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation torture a captive if it's the only way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that appears to hold out any hope of averting a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holocaust?
</em><br>
<p>no, maybe, and maybe.  If the US did that, it may have
<br>
won a battle, but probably have lost them the war via
<br>
PR relations.  It depends on what was at stake for the
<br>
British, honestly I don't recall a whole lot of wars
<br>
where they were being invaded, although I can imagine
<br>
this principle could have held in WWII.  In fact, they
<br>
did reopen the tower of London, so clearly as the
<br>
stakes rose, the actions worsened (I believe both
<br>
sides bombed innocent civilians too).  As to the
<br>
torture, it's really vague to me how torturing one
<br>
captive could avert a holocaust, but if that one was
<br>
both guilty and it could be directly correlated to
<br>
saving a 'significant' number of lives through
<br>
torture, then yes.  I have no idea what significant
<br>
is, but again this is a weird hypothetical situation,
<br>
that would also depend somewhat on the manner of the
<br>
genocide.  Are they being tortured too?  Well then it
<br>
should go without saying, torture one to prevent more
<br>
than one from torture = good.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would make a tentative &quot;yes&quot; to the above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Context must always be considered.  I will take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually dangerous route of expressing an allegiance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to complete utilitarianism now, and say that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;justified&quot; if it will lead to the best results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the long run.  Perhaps you don't find that maxim too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unobjectionable in the present discussion.
</em><br>
<p>In the current geopolitical scheme, I couldn't
<br>
possibly fathom what 'best' means.  Nor do I believe
<br>
many of those who claim to know do either.  But no,
<br>
it's not objectionable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, I would suggest that if the U.S., for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; captures an Al Qaeda terrorist who knows where an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atom
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bomb in New York city is hidden, then torture the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of him, I say, in order to learn where.  
</em><br>
<p>This is undoubtedly true, and I imagine that almost
<br>
anyone in such a position would do so.  What would
<br>
cause the problem was if the bomb wasn't found, but
<br>
otherwise I don't see where such a case would even
<br>
receive much resistance.  At the very least those who
<br>
protested the actions would be shot down by a much
<br>
stronger fervor than they've ever produced themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. captures an Iraqi soldier who knows where the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concentrations of chemical weapons are stored, then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torturing the information out of him is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justified.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The reason, approximately, is that soldier are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (these days) to be prepared to meet chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons.
</em><br>
<p>that and the US are after all the ones invading. 
<br>
Certainly at the very least, they need to live up to a
<br>
higher standard to justify any actions they do.  OTOH,
<br>
an Iraqi soldier capturing a US soldier with just
<br>
general strategy knowledge, assuming said Iraqi
<br>
intends to defend his country, could easly view
<br>
torturing information out as the only way to stand a
<br>
fighting chance. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The proximate reason is that there are conventions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war (so called &quot;rules of war&quot;, I gather, about which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know very little), and I believe that torturing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldiers is always against those rules.
</em><br>
<p>They've never been followed well, and the first ones
<br>
to break them probably used to win wars (of course not
<br>
in Germany's case a few times).  It's probably good
<br>
that most countries follow these limitations, but in
<br>
Iraq I'm not totally sure they lived up to our
<br>
war-time restrictions during peacetime, so it rings of
<br>
a victorian Brit scoffing at the Germans' manners in
<br>
WWI.  All-out war has no rules. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here also is another governing principle:  &quot;What is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to happen anyway?&quot;  I know that that doesn't sound
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a principle ;-)  but it is!   Suppose that I'm an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; captain, and the U.S. is being overrun by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Germans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japanese in the final days of World War II.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the few commanders left in the Ozarks, our last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refuge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In a daring move, we take over a Japanese supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; train,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and my Colonel orders me to kill all the truck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drivers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because we cannot afford to leave them behind us. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I can now tell with utter moral *certainty* that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause is lost, and it really won't do any good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then by God I'm going to take all those truck
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drivers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behind the hill and put some bullets in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legs---I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will not kill them.  Because what good would it do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly good standards to follow.  Although the
<br>
irony is, they'd probably face a worse fate once found
<br>
by their fellow countrymen for having been besieged. 
<br>
But an aside...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;                *              *              *
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now here are the acid questions:  (1) would you or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you not have any moral outrage against the U.S. were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans to do to enemy captives what is apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being done to theirs?  
</em><br>
<p>Okay, before I can answer this, which would you rather
<br>
have?  A few soldiers of your party captured and
<br>
tortured, or Washington routinely bombed,
<br>
communication broken off and surrounded so that
<br>
eventually if by some miracle the invading force
<br>
doesn't break through, everybody will inevitably
<br>
starve to death?  Not that I don't understand *why*
<br>
the coalition would choose this strategy in the war,
<br>
but certainly it's not a fair fight to start with.  In
<br>
other words, yes I'd find moral outrage as it's
<br>
utterly unnecessary and cruel in our case.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) Is there any act of perpetrated by the Iraqis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy combatants (or enemy nations, e.g., an A-bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New York's harbor) that would elicit moral outrage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your part?
</em><br>
<p>Certainly the A-bomb would, although I'd keep in mind
<br>
that we could have NOT invaded and this wouldn't've
<br>
happened, so perhaps the outrage would be directed at
<br>
more than one source.  OTOH, if Baghdad was on the
<br>
brink of extinction, (and I mean no question: they
<br>
either do something drastic or die, surrender not even
<br>
an option) and a centralized group of troops located
<br>
in Iraq were nuked, it would certainly be a horrible
<br>
thing, but I can't be certain I'd be outraged at them,
<br>
as they were left with no other choice.  It is for
<br>
this reason that the modern world considers political
<br>
assasinations motivated by sovereign nations to be a
<br>
no-no.  Albiet, if it's assumed that they're
<br>
comparatively defenseless and incapable, not so much.
