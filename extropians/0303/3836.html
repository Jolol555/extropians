<p>
&quot;The future is already here, it's just unevenly distributed.&quot;(1)
<br>
<p>Attention Transhumanists, Post Humans, Gallery Directors, Exhibition
<br>
Committees, etc.,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Science and technology are forcing us into a new era of ethical
<br>
development as human beings on this planet.
<br>
The popular press inundates us daily with the hope of someday living
<br>
forever, self replicating nanotechnologies(2)  including but not
<br>
limited to cloning(3), &quot;non-invasive implants that will allow us to go
<br>
on-line from the &quot;privacy&quot; of our own brain(4), and GM
<br>
foods that won't make us fat(5) but might make us smarter.
<br>
<p>For an indication of the confusion we live in, consider the following:
<br>
we have been witness to the global race between scientists
<br>
eager to be the first to clone a human being and governments eager to
<br>
pass legislation forbidding such actions.
<br>
In the controversy, governments have been swift to act against cloning
<br>
which may, arguably, have humanitarian benefits, whereas the
<br>
recent development of brain scanning that claims to be able to identify
<br>
the brain of actual or potential criminal minds (not unlike
<br>
Orwell's &quot;thought crime&quot;) is heralded as being a great development in
<br>
the
<br>
war on terrorism and the ethical considerations of such a
<br>
device and its application hardly raise an eyebrow.
<br>
<p>TRANSGENIC &lt;&gt; MORPHOSIS
<br>
<p>The following proposal is a speculative installation that draws our
<br>
attention to the ethics and real cost of technology to our
<br>
humanity. The installation takes the form of a museum-like display that
<br>
propels the viewer into the far future where they can view
<br>
primitive artifacts dating back to the 20th and 21st century.
<br>
The physical specimens on display depict the extrapolation of existing
<br>
technologies gone awry and are seen by way of stereoscopic
<br>
viewers and film loops encapsulated within biomechanical pods that hang
<br>
in space, suspended from the ceiling by way of their
<br>
&quot;umbilical&quot; cords. Quasi-robotic in appearance visitors can speculate
<br>
whether these biomechanical pods are time capsules, the
<br>
shells of downloaded memories, or severed heads of  something that once
<br>
walked the earth. Non-digital mediums are used to help
<br>
represent/create the sense of awkward obsolescence our present day
<br>
technology will seem like to a future audience.
<br>
An audio component by way of personal headsets interprets the images in
<br>
a
<br>
variety of languages.
<br>
On display with the biomechanical pods are transgenic organisms
<br>
comprised
<br>
of sterling silver, intestine, and silicone that incorporate proximity
<br>
sensors,
<br>
vibrating motors, sound operated controls, and shape memory alloys.
<br>
These organisms conjecture a
<br>
future that may include an unexpected evolution from biotechnological
<br>
wastes coming from enhanced human corpses and their
<br>
excrement. An example is the alarmingly high concentrations of estrogen
<br>
that are currently found in many bodies of fresh water that
<br>
are causing disruptive effects on the breeding cycles and feminization
<br>
of
<br>
fish and other aquatic life forms. What will happen to the
<br>
nano/biotechnologies introduced into our bodies through ingestion?
<br>
<p>Visitors are given their very own &quot;non-invasive&quot; implant upon entering
<br>
the installation for the purpose of interacting with the
<br>
Biomechanical pods, immediately connecting them to the possible
<br>
necessity
<br>
of the personal incorporation of new technologies to
<br>
their physical being in order to function in a future society.
<br>
<p>Sound is an important component of this installation. A sound piece
<br>
composed specifically for this installation helps to induce a
<br>
feeling of fear, and claustrophobia, as well as suggest the sonic
<br>
landscape of the future electronic city.
<br>
<p>We are currently working on a performance aspect which will include
<br>
&quot;screening members of the public to ensure they have the
<br>
correct Operating System (Darwin 13.2) in order to reap the most benefit
<br>
<p>from their viewing experience.&quot;

<br>
<p>&quot;We won't engineer human body 2.0 all at once....Most of us will wait
<br>
for
<br>
digestive system version 2.1 or even 2.2 before being willing to
<br>
dispense with version 1.0&quot; (6)
<br>
<p>&quot;By 2200 Homo Sapiens will be the first species on Earth to have become
<br>
voluntarily extinct.&quot; (7)
<br>
<p>Original installation concept and creation by artists:
<br>
<p>Tosca Hidalgo y Terán's mediums include an ibook, a mac G3, metal,
<br>
electronics, FlashMX and audio.
<br>
&nbsp;She has been working with metal and computers for over the past 15
<br>
years. Striving to integrate the two within her jewellery and sculptural
<br>
<p>objects, her current work explores this integration through a
<br>
combination of wire frame constructions, hollow forms, shape memory
<br>
alloys, silicone, intestine, sound chips, proximity sensors,
<br>
sonic distortions, and 3D scans.
<br>
Recent exhibitions include:
<br>
Fort Mason Center, San francisco
<br>
The House of Representatives curated by Senator Barbara Boxer
<br>
Named one of Taos' &quot;Next Generation of Artists&quot; by Harwood Museum
<br>
curator, David Witt
<br>
SFMOMA
<br>
The NEW Museum NYC
<br>
<p><p>Steve Storz has been regarded for his technological sculptures for more
<br>
than 20 years. Much of his work deals with the issues of
<br>
cast-off devices and materials that emanate from places like  &quot;Silicon
<br>
Valley.&quot;
<br>
His works have included large scale installations for San Francisco's
<br>
DNA
<br>
Lounge, film and performance art companies, electronic
<br>
and steel sculptures, avant-garde music, the World's Largest Top Hat and
<br>
<p>a smattering of two dimensional works.
<br>
Steve has recently re-entered the film world with a short film called
<br>
Embrace that was shown at the Taos Talking Picture Festival in
<br>
2002.

I am interested in ancient myths and cultures. While I believe
<br>
technology
<br>
does improve our quality of life, it seems to distort our
<br>
sense of what we can make using our hands.

<p>Anne Page co-founded Theatre Voce in 1998.

Anne's film and television credits include work with City TV, TVO, Rough
<br>
<p>Cut Productions, Walden Productions, and a guest appearance on Due

South.
<br>
<p>(installation) Space requirements:
<br>
<p>The space should ideally be enclosed (12x12') and have control of its
<br>
own lighting level as our work is best displayed in a darkened
<br>
environment.
<br>
The 5 objects that suspend from the ceiling need a secure anchoring
<br>
point as well as proximity to AC power. They need to suspend
<br>
approx. five to six feet up from the floor.
<br>
Each biomechanical pod weighs from 5 to 12lbs max.
<br>
The sculptural organisms are displayed in an enclosed plexi-glass case,
<br>
similar to glove boxes used for the handling of
<br>
biohazardous wastes.
