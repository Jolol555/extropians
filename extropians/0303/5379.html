<p>
And then there's Sean Hannity of FOX. He takes the prize for the most
<br>
offensive.
<br>
<p>A few weeks ago, Hannity interviewed a liberal who made what I thought was a
<br>
very good point: she argued that Bush had only aggravated the situation with
<br>
N. Korea by labeling that country as part of his &quot;Axis of Evil.&quot; In her
<br>
view, the word &quot;Evil,&quot; especially when capitalized, has religious
<br>
connotations and should not be used by high-level government officials in
<br>
international affairs. I'm not a liberal but I agreed completely with her
<br>
point.
<br>
<p>Sean Hannity didn't even take a moment to consider it. Instead he launched
<br>
into a scornful diatribe about how Satan really exists in the world, and
<br>
that Satan's greatest deception is in convincing people like her that he
<br>
doesn't exist.
<br>
<p>Such rot.
<br>
