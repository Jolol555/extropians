<p>
There's an extremely alarming article about the SARS outbreak in Toronto,
<br>
Canada, reported in The Toronto Sun,
<br>
<a href="http://www.canoe.ca/TorontoNews/ts.ts-03-27-0002.html">http://www.canoe.ca/TorontoNews/ts.ts-03-27-0002.html</a>.  Scarborough Grace
<br>
hospital has been effectively closed.  &quot;Anyone who has even visited the
<br>
Scarborough Grace hospital since March 16 has been asked to voluntarily
<br>
isolate themselves in their homes for 10 days since their last visit.&quot;
<br>
This amounts to perhaps 3000 people, a quarantine of unprecedented
<br>
scope for the city.
<br>
<p>Toronto has seen &quot;escalating panic&quot;, &quot;a run on surgical masks, the closing
<br>
of a school and of two hospitals' emergency and intensive-care units,
<br>
and a call by the province's nurses that no one should visit family in
<br>
hospitals or long-term care facilities.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;SARS cases have spread to York, Durham, Peel, and Simcoe. An Ottawa
<br>
man has also been isolated as a suspected SARS case, the first in that
<br>
region.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;David Lewis Public School in Scarborough remains closed until Monday
<br>
after three kindergarten students developed fevers yesterday morning. The
<br>
TDSB closed the school despite objections from Toronto Public Health.&quot;
<br>
<p>The problem with an epidemic is that it starts small and grows
<br>
exponentially, so it is hard to judge how bad it will get.  This one seems
<br>
to be about as contagious as a cold, but with at least a 5% fatality rate.
<br>
It remains to be seen whether these extensive quarantine measures will
<br>
succeed in arresting the epidemic.
<br>
<p>These signs of panic in Toronto, closing schools and hospitals,
<br>
quarantines and use of surgical masks, may be coming to your own city
<br>
soon.  This is something we should all be watching.
<br>
