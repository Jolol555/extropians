<em>&gt; &gt; The serial [way to spread memes] looks like this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----- You start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with one reasonable conclusion, which leads to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another, which leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to another, and so on.  Eventually you end up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really wild thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Which is reasonable if each step in the chain has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But is this how we actually *ever* think?  Even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; math?
</em><br>
<p>I, for one, tend to think that way.  At least when
<br>
dealing with known, solid facts.  I do, of course,
<br>
also
<br>
share the limit he noted on assuming things too far
<br>
out
<br>
when based on not totally reliable data, as often
<br>
happens with real world situations - but it is at
<br>
least
<br>
useful for predicting highly likely events that others
<br>
tend to miss.  It is just one technique, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Somehow, I always know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going before the chains of reasoning start.
</em><br>
<p>Intuition-justification, where one's subconscious
<br>
heuristics suggest a possibility, so you toss it
<br>
through conscious logic to see if it pans out.
<br>
Sometimes intuition is perfectly correct; other times
<br>
it turns out to be dangerously misleading if blindly
<br>
obeyed.  More often, intuition gives you part of the
<br>
picture, and formal logic gives you the rest,
<br>
including
<br>
nuances that your subconcious can further key off of.
<br>
Properly tuned, this cycle can be almost precognitive,
<br>
at least compared to minds unused to effectively
<br>
predicting the future.  Now, how to robustly tune this
<br>
cycle is a matter of wide debate, which has been
<br>
touched on in some aspects at least since the ancient
<br>
Greek philosophers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Most people are never convinced by a long logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deduction, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they are convinced by seeing evidence or ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again and again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, exactly so.  The only purpose that I know of to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lay out all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the arguments carefully in a long thesis is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reassure the believers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (In math, there is one additional reason:  to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain of something you already believe.  Andrew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wiles already
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly believed in Fermat's Last Theorem, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuited that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was just inches away from proving it.)
</em><br>
<p>There are areas beyond math where this is true, but in
<br>
general this usually only works when discussing
<br>
science
<br>
or engineering, and then with scientsits or engineers
<br>
(or others who have been trained in similar sytles of
<br>
thinking).  This, by itself, can explain many of the
<br>
&quot;geek&quot; trends, whose appeal is nearly or totally
<br>
invisible to those who can not even perceive tbe kind
<br>
of thinking behind them.  (Likewise, many of the
<br>
heuristic-based but ultimately illogical trends in
<br>
mass culture are at best clouded to most engineers and
<br>
scientists, especially when the heuristics are based
<br>
on
<br>
data the engineers and scientists tend to dismiss as
<br>
irrelevant.)
