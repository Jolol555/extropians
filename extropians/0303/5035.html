REgarding Google removing data from the web: yeah, so? Google isn't the
<br>
web, and its owners can remove whatever they want from their own
<br>
servers. That isn't censorship, that is version management.
<br>
<p>RE: much about al Jazeera being off the internet...
<br>
<p>Having heard that the NY Stock Exchange has decertified Al Jazeera's
<br>
correspondent at the exchange, I think that either a) some pissed
<br>
hackers have whacked Al Jazeera's server, or b) given that al Jazeera
<br>
will likely come under prosecution for war crimes (making POWs a public
<br>
spectacle and contributing to their humiliation) they might have even
<br>
been pulled offline by their own government at this point.
<br>
<p>As I've repeatedly stated on this list, it appears that far too many
<br>
people are either ignorant of the Geneva Conventions, or just don't
<br>
give a damn about them. Do you think they are rules that only the US
<br>
can be held to? Don't you realize that if one side tosses out the
<br>
Geneva Conventions, this frees the other to do the same? Do you think
<br>
they only apply to military units when their own country isn't under
<br>
attack?
<br>
<p>Today we saw a lot of evidence that Saddam and his henchmen have tossed
<br>
out the rulebook wholesale. They are using human shields, they are
<br>
dressing in civilian clothes, they are faking surrenders as a means of
<br>
ambush, they are using hospitals as bases of operations for military
<br>
attacks, they are hiding in cemetaries, they are shooting civilians who
<br>
are revolting against them, and they are even dressing up as American
<br>
troops and taking the surrender of other Iraqi troops only to shoot
<br>
them for doing so. I would not be surprised if many of the 'human
<br>
shields' are their own men dressed as civilians.
<br>
<p>Much has been trumpeted on this list by people like Samantha, Hubert,
<br>
Amara, Naddy, and others that they consider the US to be the big
<br>
threat. Who is it that is breaking the rules here? Not the US. Who is
<br>
it that is violating human rights willy-nilly? Not the US. 
<br>
<p>Our forces are struggling not just to free people who want to be freed,
<br>
our forces are working hard to get them aid so they can eat and drink
<br>
tomorrow, while Khofi Annan has abdicated UN responsibility for any aid
<br>
to people in Iraq, and Turkey is only interested in using the
<br>
opportunity to eliminate Kurd forces, and the socialist/communist
<br>
organizations around the world continue to demonstrate they are not for
<br>
human rights, they are not for democracy or freedom. They are only
<br>
interested in subverting the rule of law and attacking the real bastion
<br>
of liberty in the world.
