</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Korea, the ratio was 4:1 (4 N Koreans/Chinese for each American).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Vietnam, the ratio was 15:1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Gulf 1, the ratio was 400:1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In Mogadishu, the ratio was 50:1, but US forces made many serious

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I appreciate the information, but I think I was not clear enough with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my 15-1 statistic.  What I meant was, for every fifteen U.S. troops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in these theaters, one was seriously wounded or killed.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistic has amazingly held over all major wars since WWII (with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big exception of the first Gulf War). 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, that statistic has not held over all major wars. For example,
<br>
Vietnam had 300,000 wounded and 50,000 killed. With 2.5 million served
<br>
time in theater, that is a bit less than 15 to one (which would be
<br>
375,000 total wounded or killed). If you compare with, say, the Civil
<br>
War, you have a serious problem. The US military in theater in the
<br>
Vietnam War was supported immensely by the logistical infrastructure of
<br>
the rest of the US military, particularly those bases in the
<br>
Phillipines, Okinawa, Japan, Korea, Guam, and the US west coast,
<br>
without which it could not have performed as it did in theater. The US
<br>
Civil War's theater was the continental eastern US, which entirely
<br>
enclosed the US military logistical infrastructure (as well as that of
<br>
the CSA). To properly compare the two, you'd have to count the entire
<br>
military in both conflicts, at which point you'd see the Vietnam
<br>
casualty rate was less than 1/10th that of the Civil War.
<br>
<p>The primary contributor to figures like a 15 to 1 ratio is the simple
<br>
fact that most members of the military in theater historically have not
<br>
been combat units. The US expeditionary forces are slightly different
<br>
because there has been a big shift in the last 10-20 years toward
<br>
mobility, rapid deployment, and an &quot;everybody fights&quot; mentality as much
<br>
as possible. This is an attitude universal in all Marine units, for
<br>
example. Today, the only non-combat units are supply units, which in
<br>
this environment are exposed to combat while in convoy, and HQ cadres
<br>
and Naval Air and Air Force shipboard and ground units. Even then,
<br>
naval vessels are platforms for launching Tomahawks, and are subject to
<br>
mines and hit and run speedboats, while I hear that A-10 warthog units
<br>
have moved into seized bases inside Iraq.
<br>
<p>Even by Gulf War I standards, todays US military is more highly mobile
<br>
and far more potent a force than before, and technology has become such
<br>
a mantra as THE force multiplier concept.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that statistic held for this conflict we would have 17,000 wounded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or dead on our hands.  I don't think when the dust settles it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite that high, but it could easily be in the thousands when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think of the nature of urban combat in a city of millions and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Republic Guard in civilian dress lurking in ambush at the local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hospital or school.
</em><br>
<p>If the Iraqis resort to chemical weapons and an urban war, I can easily
<br>
imagine the US casualties rising into the thousands. I can also see in
<br>
such situation that Iraqi on Iraqi casualties will be immensely high in
<br>
a typical terrorist &quot;See what you made me do&quot; manner. Even worse, it
<br>
seems that Saddam has a &quot;if I can't own Iraq, nobody can&quot; sort of
<br>
extreme scorched people policy.
<br>
<p>None of this makes me think that freeing the Iraqi people isn't a good
<br>
idea, and I challenge anyone to claim otherwise, and claim they are in
<br>
any way supporters of ideas of universal human rights.
<br>
<p>The 17,000 figure was based on the D-Day operation, which also notes
<br>
that there were 14,000 civilian French dead in the same period in that
<br>
local area. If the 80:20 figure also applies to civilians, then that
<br>
means there were 56,000 French civilians wounded in the same period and
<br>
area.
