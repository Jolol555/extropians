</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I've been wondering on why are transhumanists so confident that we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reach the singularity. I'm about to finish my Ph.D. on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology of aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I've been thinking about the developments of the past few years, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just on aging but in other areas too. In truth, I'm disappointed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what's being done and I want to know why are transhumanists so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confident we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will reach the singularity. For instance, astrophysics and space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploration have been stagnating. It's been 30 years since a man
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walked on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moon and, though I'm not an expert, I don't see how our recent models
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the universe--e.g. superstring theory--are more likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the models from Einstein's time. It's true breakthroughs have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biology and medicine, such as the Human Genome Project, but, shit, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't even cured AIDS, how can we expect to cure aging anytime soon?
</em><br>
<p>See my other post on this point. We need to increase funding by managing,
<br>
growing and presenting demand for improvements in real anti-aging medicine.
<br>
Loud, widespread demand indicates a future market to the money men. They
<br>
then release the floodgates of funding.
<br>
<p>Realistically, assuming that the US and more governments manage not to shut
<br>
down all avenues of anti-aging research, we're looking at minor anti-aging
<br>
medical technologies becoming available in ten years, and getting to the
<br>
level at which AIDS medicines are now in 20-30 years. This is conditional on
<br>
us winning the war of memes with the deathist bioethicists. If they convince
<br>
the world that no-one should have anti-aging technology, that it's immoral
<br>
and unimportant, that it will be legislated against, then the markets will
<br>
never come into being. The research will never happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, I'm disappointed with the way science is made in the academia with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal egos rising above finding the mechanisms of aging. If we want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cure aging, we need to work together, but not many do that.
</em><br>
<p>This is the way science always works in a young field. The funding game is
<br>
competitive. There isn't enough funding to create larger teams that work in
<br>
competition with one another. The team is generally 1 or 2 people at the
<br>
moment, so individual egos are much less constrained. So I see the problem
<br>
as being a lack of funding, rather than a failing of human nature.
