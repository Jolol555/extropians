<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the first official announcement of the Secretary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of PUKE (Professional Uplifting Killing Experience)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bring your personal throw up to the local PC!
</em><br>
<p>May I ask what is the purpose of bringing the taste of this
<br>
forum to a new low?  Have you completely abandoned even the
<br>
pretence of decorum and civility here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; From today on everybody who feels like he has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; puke when watching Fuehrer George Troubleyou Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; addressing the US army,
</em><br>
<p>What makes you think that you have some prerogative to
<br>
play the Hitler-card?  Does it never occur to you that
<br>
name calling ought to have no place here?  In three
<br>
posts in a row, you have gone way out of your way to
<br>
express your extreme emotional overreactions.  I'm
<br>
not at all sure just what to say...
<br>
<p>So I'll put out a more general question.  How is it that
<br>
a current member of the nation of Germany, who has a 
<br>
history on this list of having engaged in a number of
<br>
abstract conversations, is so traumatized by what he's
<br>
seeing or hearing that he's coming to behave as a
<br>
self-anointed &quot;secretary of PUKE&quot;?
<br>
<p>Now were he directly involved (say he lived in Iraq, or
<br>
had lost family members in terrorist bombings, or had
<br>
known friends who died at the hands of the armed services
<br>
of the United States), then I might understand.  But as it
<br>
is, I simply don't.
<br>
<p>So perhaps we should all ask ourselves:  Just what would
<br>
have to happen to us to force us off the edge the way it
<br>
has Hubert?
<br>
<p>Would one have to work in a Hospital emergency room?  Would
<br>
one have to interview rape victims for a living?  Would one
<br>
have to suffer the actual deprivations of combat, or, perhaps
<br>
worse, live as a civilian in a combat zone?  For the life of
<br>
me, I can't quite see how watching television would ever
<br>
bring me to the crisis that Hubert is evidently experiencing.
<br>
<p>Just what manner of international incident, especially
<br>
were my own nation not involved, or descriptions of world
<br>
catastrophes consuming millions of lives would bring this
<br>
out in me?
<br>
<p>I know that some here have expressed wishes of pity for him,
<br>
but it's unclear how sincere these were.  (For me, I'm not
<br>
really sure that he himself is suffering that much, or even
<br>
absolutely confident that he's as emotionally overwrought to
<br>
the degree it appears.)  However, I can advise him to stand
<br>
back from that which may be distressing him so much;  perhaps
<br>
for a few days or weeks, and try to regain a little stability.
<br>
<p>Also, there might be other lists on which he could vent his
<br>
emotions and coarse metaphors?  Eh?
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or US /UK war criminals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing Iraqi civilians might bring his warmest throw up to his local PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Puke Container) where the community's collective stomach contents will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathered and sent to the White House in Washington, D.C., USA as our live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stream contribution to this glorious crusade of God's own country.
