IGNORANCE AND ARROGANCE
<br>
By Tim Gorski MD
<br>
<p>In “A Lesson In Chemistry and Chicanery” [The Skeptic, March 1999] well 
<br>
over a thousand words were devoted to a very superficial discussion of 
<br>
chemistry in order to support a much more succinct dismissal of a 
<br>
“nutritional supplement” product as being a preposterous fraud.  But 
<br>
absurd claims remain absurd claims whether or not the ignorant 
<br>
understand why.  The task of skeptics is to help themselves and others 
<br>
overcome ignorance, of course, but some people will always insist on 
<br>
believing weird things.
<br>
<p>Not long ago, for example, I briefly dealt with a popular diet book by 
<br>
“naturopathic physician” Peter J. D’Adamo entitled Eat Right 4 Your Type 
<br>
in which it was claimed that one’s blood type determines how one should 
<br>
eat.  When I first heard about this book, I had a good laugh and moved 
<br>
on to other things since it seemed headed for the remainder houses. 
<br>
Then, when it was picked up by the Book of the Month Club as an 
<br>
alternate selection, I mentioned it in my monthly column directed to my 
<br>
medical colleagues in The Tarrant County Physician as follows:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if he can succeed with this awesome nonsense, “Dr.” D’Adamo can 
<br>
get to work on sequels that might explain how people can “eat right” for 
<br>
their Rh factors and the rest of their red cell antigens, not to mention 
<br>
their HLA types, hemoglobin electrophoresis profiles, and maybe even 
<br>
their genotypes and the residual vibrations of their ancestors’ 
<br>
genotypes even if they didn’t get them by heredity!  The sober 
<br>
conclusion to be drawn, though, is that many people remain woefully 
<br>
uninformed about the most elementary facts relating to their lives and 
<br>
health. People who would scoff at a proposal that a car’s paint color 
<br>
determines what sort of gasoline or oil should be used for the vehicle 
<br>
or that a home’s exterior brickwork determines how the furniture inside 
<br>
should be arranged are nevertheless apparently willing to consider this 
<br>
particular delusion.
<br>
<p>These remarks reflected the fact that blood types, of which there are 
<br>
far more than the ABO group, merely reflect the sort of immunologic 
<br>
identifying molecules, or antigens, that happen to be on the outsides of 
<br>
people’s cells.  HLA types amount to the same thing.  And genotypes – 
<br>
the exact genetic heritage one possesses – may or may not be reflected 
<br>
in one’s phenotype of expressed genes.  So, for example, a brown-eyed 
<br>
person may have a recessive gene for blue eyes.  But there is no reason 
<br>
for supposing that one’s diet should be dictated by such things, any 
<br>
more than that people should eat differently depending on the shape of 
<br>
their fingernails or the size of their parents’ noses.  To anyone who 
<br>
understands the facts concerning blood groups, in other words, D’Adamo’s 
<br>
claims are plainly nonsensical.
<br>
<p>But it seems that many people don’t understand these facts, which 
<br>
accounts for the following email that I received by someone who was 
<br>
incensed by my dismissal of D’Adamo’s book:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“I think your analogy with the car is incorrect (about the blood 
<br>
type diet).  Instead of saying that every person would know that the 
<br>
colour of the car does not determine the gasoline or oil to be used, you 
<br>
should say that the type of engine determines the type of fuel to be 
<br>
used.  Because the food we eat is the fuel by which we move.  I think it 
<br>
is also presumptuous to shoot down a book by using some wishy washy 
<br>
analogy instead of scientific evidence.  If you were to give some proof 
<br>
instead of some arrogant sarcastic commentary I might have been 
<br>
interested in what you had to say.”
<br>
<p>Of course, it is true that a vehicle’s fuel needs are not determined by 
<br>
its paint color.  That was the whole point of my use of the analogy in 
<br>
illustrating what D’Adamo’s advice amounts to.  Of course a person’s 
<br>
diet should be determined by the needs and characteristics of their 
<br>
“engine,” which is to say, their metabolic needs (as well as their 
<br>
metabolic idiosyncrasies).  Thus, phenylketonurics should avoid certain 
<br>
foods and/or additives rich in the amino acid phenylalanine, diabetics 
<br>
need to follow special diets, and people with certain intestinal 
<br>
disorders need to include or avoid various dietary constituents.  But 
<br>
none of these things have anything to do with people’s blood types!  Nor 
<br>
are individual human beings so different from each other in terms of 
<br>
their ordinary (not associated with any medical disorders) dietary needs 
<br>
as they are from, say, koala bears who subsist solely on eucalyptus leaves.
<br>
<p>In all fairness, D’Adamo does his best to make is argument subtle, if 
<br>
not plausible.  The essence of his claim is that the ABO blood groups 
<br>
are a sort of marker for underlying metabolic differences between 
<br>
people.  But this hardly helps matters because, if it were so, then 
<br>
every other sort of seemingly irrelevant genetic trait should be at 
<br>
least as good a marker as well: the aforementioned other blood types, 
<br>
HLA types, hair color, eye color, complexion, and so on.  Most 
<br>
importantly, there simply is no evidence for D’Adamo’s ideas, which is a 
<br>
good part of what makes them so absurd.
<br>
<p>All such considerations, of course, are “wishy-washy” to true 
<br>
believerss.  For them, only a meticulous, exhaustive, and point-by-point 
<br>
refutation of each and every speculative notion that someone as creative 
<br>
as D’Adamo can imagine is sufficient to demonstrate fairness.  But it is 
<br>
rare that even this will be sufficient enough to persuade them of their 
<br>
errors.  For they are only “interested in” showing their unswerving 
<br>
devotion to their chosen nonsense in the face of “arrogant” and 
<br>
“sarcastic” criticism.  Indeed no amount of facts and reason will 
<br>
dissuade true believers, because their beliefs are acts of faith and not 
<br>
conclusions of facts and reason.
<br>
<p>This, in the final analysis, is the nature of the divide between people 
<br>
who believe weird things and those who are not satisfied unless they 
<br>
have sufficient facts and reason.  The believers are certain that they 
<br>
have the truth, and consider all who doubt and scorn their truth to be 
<br>
arrogant fault-finders if not members of the relevant conspiracy. 
<br>
Skeptics, on the other hand, know only too well the tentative and 
<br>
fragile nature of human understanding, and how easy it is to be fooled. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why they insist on protecting valid knowledge, especially the 
<br>
most valuable and well-established of it, from both groundless attack 
<br>
and unworthy pretenders.  For the worst sort of arrogance is ignorance.
