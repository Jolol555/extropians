</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; too, so I'm going to mention Eliezer Yudkowsky here. Hi, Eliezer!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Thanks for this reference. It does remind me very much of &quot;Solution
<br>
Unsatisfactory&quot;. Some years later Heinlein pointed out that while we now had
<br>
several kinds of WMD we had not even developed an unsatisfactory solution to
<br>
the problem they presented.
<br>
<p>Basically I think that the diagnosis is pretty accurate but in some ways not
<br>
pessimistic enough. However I think that the prescription is both
<br>
unrealistic and potentially disastrous both for America and the rest of the
<br>
world. My points of agreement first.
<br>
<p>1. It is true that the classic idea of sovereignty is now both dangerous and
<br>
outdated and not just because of WMD. It's worth remembering that the
<br>
concept of sovereignty itself was formulated in a specific place and time
<br>
(France 1580s/90s) as a response to a political impasse arising from a
<br>
change in military organisation and technology. It isn't an eternal feature
<br>
of political arrangements.
<br>
<p>2. A very important point is the bad effects of the growing lack of
<br>
competition between states and the growth of states that are not viable by
<br>
conventional standards. Apart from anything else this removes the main
<br>
incentive for elites to adopt sensible economic and social policies - Latin
<br>
America is a classic demonstration of this. I also agree that it does lead
<br>
to a lack of realism on the part of national elites.
<br>
<p>My main critical responses (for now)
<br>
<p>3. It isn't clear to me why Muslims are more prone to fantasising and lack
<br>
of realism than others as a result of the lack of competition in the state
<br>
system (a shorthand way of talking about the end of imperialism BTW). Surely
<br>
elites in other parts of the world are affected just as much by the
<br>
incentives this produces? The only factor he sets out is the impact of oil
<br>
revenues. However other parts of the world have windfall oil revenues
<br>
without it producing this kind of fantasising (eg Nigeria, Venezuela). Also
<br>
there are plenty of Islamic fantasists in places that have not had this kind
<br>
of windfall. I think you have to consider the fact that there is something
<br>
specific and peculiar about the Islamic Middle East's response to modernity,
<br>
which is about more than the weakness of the Westphalian state system.
<br>
Perhaps even more alarming, radical Islam may just be the first example of a
<br>
trend, of cultic oppositional subcultures that reject and resist modernity
<br>
by violent means.
<br>
<p>4. The article connects the problems posed by WMD to the malfunctioning of a
<br>
system of sovereign states. The assumption is you need a state to create
<br>
such devices or supply them to crazies such as Al Quaida. Why? I just don't
<br>
see this. I'm afraid I am more pessimistic than he is in some ways, I think
<br>
you don't need to be a state or have the backing of one to cause huge havoc,
<br>
given the interconnected and centralised organisation of our civilisation.
<br>
<p>5. My main criticism is this. His solution to the problem is something
<br>
called neo-sovereignty, efectively an Americam Empire (ok a benign hegemony
<br>
if you prefer). Why should the second rank powers put up with this? All the
<br>
historic precedents suggest that a policy like this will simply produce an
<br>
alliance of other lesser powers against the hegemon which will raise the
<br>
costs of such a policy (in every sense) to an unacceptably high level. It's
<br>
no good saying &quot;They'll accept it because it's in their interest&quot;. The
<br>
response is likely to be &quot;Thanks, but no thanks&quot;.
<br>
