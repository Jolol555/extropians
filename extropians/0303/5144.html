<em>&gt;&gt;Based on these estimates I have not been particularly concerned about
</em><br>
Gulf 2.  It is generally known &gt;&gt; that traffic fatalities in the US run
<br>
to about 80 per day, or 2400 per month.  So far, US war 
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt; fatalities have run to about 4 per day.
</em><br>
<p>Based on how many people we over there, how many of our people would be
<br>
expected statisticly to die if they were stayed home from auto
<br>
accidents, fires, street crime, suicides, etc...
<br>
<p>I thought I had read an analysis after Gulf War 1 that more people would
<br>
have actually died if the Gulf War 1 didn't happen just from normal
<br>
causes of death by staying home!
<br>
<p>Wouldn't it be ironic if the war actually saved American lives by
<br>
keeping them out of harms way?
<br>
<p>Even more ironic is that the antiwar protests may actually be costing
<br>
more American lives than the war by causing traffic accidents, and
<br>
stopping traffic preventing fire, ambulance, and police from getting to
<br>
where they are needed.

</em><br>
<p>In WWII, the US had a 2:3 kill ratio (2 germans killed for every
<br>
American). In Korea, the ratio was 4:1 (4 N Koreans/Chinese for each
<br>
American). In Vietnam, the ratio was 15:1. In Gulf 1, the ratio was
<br>
400:1. In Mogadishu, the ratio was 50:1, but US forces made many serious
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;operational errors (flying too low with lightly armored helicopters,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;driving through streets in unarmored trucks, no air support).  
<br>
<p>A conservative but realistic estimate might be 200:1, midway between 
<br>
Mogadishu and Gulf 1.  Assuming that Saddam has 150,000 loyal troops who
<br>
<p>will fight until they become casualties, US casualties can be estimated 
<br>
at 750.  Typically, 80% of casualties are wounded.  Thus US fatalities 
<br>
can be estimated at 150.
<br>
<p>Civilian casualties in Gulf 1 were estimated at 1 per 15 Iraqi soldiers.
<br>
Thus Iraqi civilian casualties can be estimated at 10,000, with about 
<br>
20% fatalities, or 2000.
<br>
<p>Based on these estimates I have not been particularly concerned about
<br>
Gulf 2.  It is generally known that traffic fatalities in the US run to 
<br>
about 80 per day, or 2400 per month.  So far, US war fatalities have run

to about 4 per day.
