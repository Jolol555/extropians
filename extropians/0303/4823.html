<em>&gt;&gt; I confess I don't understand these actions.
</em><br>
<p>I believe it is a tongue in cheek humourous statement designed to remind
<br>
people constantly of just how badly the French stabbed us in the back!
<br>
<p>The average American doesn't buy very many French products that they're
<br>
aware at least.  So by constantly reminding themselves and others of
<br>
what was done by the French they feed the MEME and get others who do buy
<br>
French products to think twice about who they're supporting.
<br>
<p>It would also be appropriate for prostitutes who currently refer to oral
<br>
sex as French to relabel that act Freedom.  And to perhaps take the act
<br>
known as Greek and relabel it French in honor of what they did to us.
<br>
Somehow I don't think Greece will mind.

<p><p><p><em>&gt;  House restaurants have renamed french fries &quot;freedom fries.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>I confess I don't understand these actions. I doubt that 'french fries'
<br>
have anything to do with the French people. I suspect that it is an
<br>
American invention, like 'french toast' is probably an American
<br>
invention. (French people don't have french toast in their recipe
<br>
books.) This sort of cultural naming of food is not limited to
<br>
Americans, Hawaiians don't have Hawaiian toast, either, which you can
<br>
find on many German menus!
