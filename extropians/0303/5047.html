<em>&gt; &gt; By the way, if anybody still wants an &quot;Old&quot; European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Liberation Army to come over and liberate your people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the BUsh junta, I guess chances are good now.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; few month ago I was the only one I knew who propagated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this proposal, but meanwhile, where 50.000 schoolboys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and schoolgirls gathered in Berlin on the first day of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; war, I heard similar statements.  Makes me think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; young generation in Germany is on the right path.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, a lot of German schoolboys in the last century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conceived that a number of other countries needed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberating---
</em><br>
<p>These contemporary schoolboys and girls are against war in general. They
<br>
have
<br>
learned their lesson. Their proposal to liberate the US cannot be more than
<br>
an ironic expression of  frustration and powerlessness. Same with me by the
<br>
way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sounds like the young generation might be on the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed path as last time around.  :-(   Fifty thousand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eh?  Was it by any chance a torchlight get-together?
</em><br>
<p>No, they assembled in the center of Berlin in the morning, a lot of them
<br>
encouraged by their teachers to leave school and protest against the war
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly be, JUST POSSIBLY, that the U.S. is seen as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superpower that needs cutting down to size, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is the actual unconscious motivation?
</em><br>
<p>No, I am absolutely free of envy. As far as I am concerned the US can stay
<br>
the most powerful nation in the world. I have nothing to do with power and
<br>
military and weapon business and all that sick stuff. But here the USA is an
<br>
aggressor and all you war supporters are caught in the hugest propaganda
<br>
trap of all times.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Many private and public aid organisations are trying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to alleviate the misery that your abused and betrayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; soldiers have caused.  The biggest private German
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; medicine organisation is on the way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where were they when the tens of thousands of Iraqis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were being brutalized by that regime?  Selling goods
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the Iraq regime, I've heard say.
</em><br>
<p>I am no fan of German business criminals or corrupt politicians. I am no
<br>
fucking patriot. Do not confuse my point of view with the behaviour of
<br>
German business men and politicians. There are some weapon connections
<br>
between Iraq and Germany, I know it and I do not approve of it.
<br>
<p>But I was talking about German humanitarian help TODAY for the desaster that
<br>
the US and British forces have caused.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I feel pity for these very young POWs shown on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; TV.  Poor kids, probably thought they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; invincible because they belong to God's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; country.  Bullshit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now I know I'm right about your deep feeling of wanting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cut the U.S. down to size.
</em><br>
<p>You Americans can stay the best, be the winner all the time, I don't care.
<br>
Be proud and pray. But please: stay at home and let your young generation
<br>
LIVE.
<br>
<p>I was talking here about the ill-fated connection between a fundamentalistic
<br>
religious sense of mission and devastating military power and the absolutely
<br>
vicious seduction of  the young generation to fight thousands of miles away
<br>
from home for the false goals of a senile president who was an alcoholic and
<br>
is not able to read or understand a complex text. It makes me mad to see
<br>
that the archetype of old men sending their grandsons and daughters to die
<br>
is still alive and kicking.
<br>
<p>If the USA were attacked and invaded by troops: you could count on me, I
<br>
would be your ally from the first minute. But this &quot;forced diplomacy&quot; going
<br>
on there in the desert is absolutely wrong.
<br>
<p>Don't you see that the whole world is against you??
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm amazed that more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europeans don't feel this same thing that you do.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge part of European culture has had the built-in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption for centuries of their ruling over the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the world, and so watching the US and USSR usurp that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; role simply cannot have gone down easily for many.
</em><br>
<p>In an international forum like this one you must face the danger of being
<br>
confused with the view point of your Government. I am sure the feelings
<br>
that you suspect here, exist in a minority of the power elite in every
<br>
European country. But there is today an overwhelming majority in Germany
<br>
that in contrast to the USA has learned it's historical lesson - finally.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While I'm sure that I would feel the same way to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; small degree, I'd also be able to keep those feelings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very much in check, as in fact so many Europeans have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed shown they can do.
</em><br>
<p>Fucking NO. Why should I keep my feelings in check? I know I am powerless,
<br>
and I won't stop yelling at persons who do not comprehend
<br>
that the USA is committing a crime right now.
