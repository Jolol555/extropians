</em><br>
<p>The &quot;most powerful military force in the world&quot; is not sentient in
<br>
itself and is not in itself either benevolent or malevolent, wise or
<br>
foolish rather it is an instrument of the judgement of its 
<br>
commander in chief - President Bush. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;International Law&quot; is a silly term anyway, a &quot;law&quot; means 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things must happen this was as in the laws of motion or it 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Well I guess &quot;international law&quot; *would* be a stretch if one did
<br>
not know of a meaning of the word &quot;law&quot; that related in some 
<br>
way to &quot;courts&quot; and &quot;legislatures&quot;.
<br>
<p>The dictionary I just happen to have nearby (The Collins 
<br>
Concise) has this to say about &quot;law&quot;: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Law n. 1. a rule or set of rules, enforceable by the courts (sic) 
<br>
regulationg the relationship between the state and its subjects,
<br>
and the conduct of subjects towards one another. 2. a. a rule 
<br>
or body of rules made by the legislature (sic).&quot; (It goes on, quite
<br>
a long way after that especially for a &quot;concise&quot; dictionary). 
<br>
<p>Courts! Legislature!
<br>
<p>Here's a link to a document called The Constitution of the United
<br>
States which seems to relate to &quot;law&quot; more as it might be 
<br>
understood in this usage. 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html">http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.overview.html</a>
<br>
<p>Might be good to check it out sometime and read about such 
<br>
esoterics as The Legislative Branch, The Presidency, The 
<br>
Judiciary and the Legal Status of the Constitution. 
<br>
<p>Personally, I reckon, that some interest in the US constitution,
<br>
the UN Charter, and perhaps even the Extropian Principles
<br>
might not be unhealthy at present (even for those of us who are
<br>
not American). The future must be reached from the present and
<br>
it seems that many bright capable folk don't really understand the
<br>
basics of the current society in which we live. How can we 
<br>
change something for the better if we don't understand it? 
<br>
<p>If knowledge is power then I would suggest to whoever finds 
<br>
some resonance, as I do, in the extropian principles to recognize
<br>
that some knowledge is a whole lot more powerful and worth 
<br>
acquiring quickly than others types of knowledge. It is actually
<br>
possible for civilization to slip backwards. The &quot;dark ages&quot; is 
<br>
not a historical reference to a solar eclispe.
<br>
<p>International law is not that esoteric. It arises simply because
<br>
the heads of countries ratified (signed) treaties and agreed to 
<br>
honor the mutual obligations contained therein. 
<br>
<p>If,  instead of revoking them, heads of nation states like the 
<br>
USA, the UK and Australia choose to selectively break 
<br>
international treaties when and as they see fit, on what basis can
<br>
their citizens have confidence that those same heads of state will
<br>
not use their power to selectively interpret their obligations to 
<br>
their individual citizens?
