[Cato Institute]
<br>
This year marks the 60th anniversary of the publication of The 
<br>
Fountainhead by Ayn Rand, The Discovery of Freedom by Rose Wilder 
<br>
Lane, and The God of the Machine by Isabel Paterson. Cato Institute 
<br>
celebrates Women's History
<br>
month by celebrating them.

<br>
<p><p>By coincidence, late last night, I saw part of The Fountainhead (1949)
<br>
on Italian television. Gary Cooper and Patricia Neal speaking those
<br>
black and white lines in Italian was very interesting. I do like this
<br>
movie even though many find the characters wooden because this novel
<br>
represents a time in my life of a  door opening into the world of
<br>
ideas for a very young Amara Graps. The movie (and novel) characters,
<br>
even with their flaws (human lives are much richer than what these
<br>
characters portray), are to me a dramatization of a philosophy of
<br>
living a life of integrity and striving to be better, and for that
<br>
I'm grateful for being introduced to Rand's works.
<br>
<p>While I was trying to remember some details of this movie for this
<br>
post, I discovered via google, something else interesting:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.gnovies.com/">http://www.gnovies.com/</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Welcome to the world of movies: Gnovies!
<br>
Gnovies is a self-adapting community system based on the gnod engine.
<br>
Let's make it the most useful movie resource on the net!&quot;
<br>
<p>It will generate for you a selection of other movies that you might
<br>
like from your input movie. For example, if one inputs The Fountainhead
<br>
into this engine, gnod thinks that you will also like: Village of the
<br>
Damned, Greed, War of the Worlds, Godfather Part II, which make me
<br>
wonder about components of the engine! I suggest exploring a bit,
<br>
and trying more of your own selections. Amuse yourself.
