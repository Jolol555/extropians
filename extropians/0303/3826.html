<p>
For those concerned with setting priorities (for humanity)
<br>
I offer the following.
<br>
<p>A recent &quot;New Scientist&quot; report documents that we are losing
<br>
56 million people a year (deaths) and that it is likely that
<br>
poor diet (including obesity in large part) contributes to
<br>
60 percent of those deaths and nearly half the global burden
<br>
of disease.  Note that &quot;obesity&quot; means you are consuming *more*
<br>
of the planetary resources than is necessary to survive.
<br>
Also note that I include myself in this category, so I'm
<br>
not pointing fingers without including myself.
<br>
<p>Thus the U.S. could eliminate the entire population of Iraq
<br>
(~24 million people, a one time event) and still be
<br>
causing significantly less &quot;extropic&quot; damage than
<br>
excess caloric consumption is doing (*each* year).
<br>
<p>So, *why* the blazes is the ExI list debating IRAQ when
<br>
it should be debating caloric intake?  Just what part
<br>
of the principle of &quot;rational thinking&quot; is not being
<br>
understood (e.g. saving more people is perhaps better
<br>
than saving fewer people)?  While I will freely
<br>
admit that saving any and all people is preferable
<br>
but that just isn't the world we live in -- particularly
<br>
when some of those people view it as their &quot;job&quot;
<br>
to eliminate others.  One has to take sides and one
<br>
has to act.  Where are the really extropic actors
<br>
who recognize just where the leverage points are?
<br>
<p>The point of the above diatribe is that one might save
<br>
many more people with some carefully executed interventions
<br>
in obesity than days upon days of discussion about Iraq.
<br>
Food for thought (I hope).
<br>
<p>(I apologize to any Iraqi citizens on the list for the
<br>
use of the above example, but I'm trying to make an
<br>
&quot;extropic&quot; point and must sometimes use extreme examples.)
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
