<br>
<p>Steve,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you and I may have a problem of not having made the meaning of 
<br>
our labels both clear and agreed upon.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, imperialism in my mind applies only with the taking of 
<br>
land.  By that definition you British were had an empire in that you 
<br>
conquered countries and subjected them to your ownership.  By and large the 
<br>
US has stayed away from that sort of thing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand some folks talk about cultural empirialism.  That 
<br>
term is a little more vague in my mind.  However I happen to be in a position 
<br>
where I observe everyday the rush of young people around the globe taking up 
<br>
the standards and pasttimes of American teenagers.  Perhaps you could 
<br>
describe that as cultural imperialism?  On the other hand it seems to be done 
<br>
without coercion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I confess to not having a clue as to what you are talking about when 
<br>
you use the term &quot;liberal empiralism.&quot;  In my experience liberal is a term 
<br>
that socialist apply to themselves to disguise who they really are.  Are you 
<br>
suggesting that the Americans will attempt to turn the Iraqi into a bunch of 
<br>
democratic socialists?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all I am asking you to expand and expound upon what you mean.  
<br>
For example, I have no idea what you mean by the following sentence, &quot;The 
<br>
evidence as to whether this is &quot;what the US government is thinking&quot; will only 
<br>
become really clear
<br>
after any way in Iraq.&quot;  Would you mind helping me with that sentence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I truly do want to know what you are thinking about.
<br>
Ron h.
