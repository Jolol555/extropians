<em>&gt; &gt;This resumes a discussion about whether it's people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&quot;lives&quot; or people-years we wish to save. &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here we are getting to the crux of the matter. The word &quot;lives&quot; is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently defined as to make these kinds of distinctions cut and dry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's an abstraction of the same quality as &quot;peace&quot; which can obviously be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpreted a zillion different ways by a zillion different people.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Two home runs.  Bravo!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I suspect the word &quot;lives&quot; may also be buried under layer upon layer of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unavoidable sapient racism.
</em><br>
<p>I sort of doubt it---what you do next leads in the right direction,
<br>
and I don't really see any difficulties with our unconscious values.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I say I'm concerned with saving &quot;lives&quot;, I am probably concerned with:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	-Minimizing pain and suffering (primarily sentient, but it's a clunky
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sliding scale which descends all the way down to &quot;that whatsoever possesseth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a nervous system&quot;)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	-Maximizing happiness/joy/fulfillment/wonder etc. (ditto the above)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	-Maximizing the spread of memes more like mine
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly right.  In other words, we wish to convert the universe
<br>
into living tissue that enjoys itself.  It must also become more and 
<br>
more and more advanced, or it will be missing out on even greater ways
<br>
of enjoying itself, e.g., happiness/joy/fulfillment/satisfaction/contentment
<br>
(and don't forget ecstasy).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 	-Minimizing the spread of memes less like mine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 	- And destroying memes (and their hosts) that pose a clear and present
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger to the continuing survival of memes more like mine as well as memes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less like mine.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Okay,  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (That last one is a matter for which I ultimately rely upon my own judgment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to determine based upon a good faith attempt at objectively examining the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memes in question along with whatever evidence and judgments of others I see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as credible, accessible, and pertinent at the time. - Needs work, I know, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd forgive all of you for not just handing over the keys to the matrix
</em><br>
<em>&gt; server until I get it all worked out sufficiently :-)
</em><br>
<p>It certainly does need work!  But just getting people to understand
<br>
the overall goals is hard enough.  For most people, stamping out death,
<br>
and relentlessly converting everything to be alive, i.e., converting
<br>
all matter to life, seem like bizarre, boring, and uninteresting goals.
<br>
<p>Now obesity, on the other hand, that's something here and now
<br>
that we can focus on!
