<p>Am I to understand (as I think Ron's investigation exposed) that
<br>
this is still just tentative legislation?  Oh, well, a minor point
<br>
since here we are about ideas.
<br>
<p>Hubert, since you have taken it upon yourself to point out
<br>
where America's &quot;paranoid&quot; and &quot;future war criminal&quot; leaders
<br>
are turning America into a &quot;police state&quot;, could you be more
<br>
specific?  What I mean is, what portions of that very long
<br>
ACLU document trouble you the most?  Could we focus on
<br>
something in particular, please?
<br>
<p>Now, just so you know that I am sincere, I read through the first
<br>
sections of that document.  Only four times out of the many, many
<br>
items (mostly doing with wiretapping and communications) did my
<br>
alarm bells go off.  If you want, we could start with these four
<br>
(although please mention any others that seem more to the point.)
<br>
<p>Here are the four that raised my eyebrows:
<br>
<p>1. Using an overbroad definition of terrorism that could cover some protest tactics such as those used by Operation Rescue or
<br>
protesters at Vieques Island, Puerto Rico as a new predicate for criminal wiretapping and other electronic surveillance.  (Sections
<br>
120 and 121)
<br>
<p>&quot;Eh, freedom to protest is being infringed?  Yikes.&quot;
<br>
<p>2. Permitting searches, wiretaps and surveillance of United States citizens on behalf of foreign governments – including
<br>
dictatorships and human rights abusers – in the absence of Senate-approved treaties.  (Sections 321-22)
<br>
<p>&quot;Permitting searches of citizens?&quot;  Oh, oh!
<br>
<p>3. Stripping even native-born Americans of all of the rights of United States citizenship if they provide support to unpopular
<br>
organizations labeled as terrorist by our government, even if they support only the lawful activities of such organizations,
<br>
allowing them to be indefinitely imprisoned in their own country as undocumented aliens.  (Section 501)
<br>
<p>&quot;Stripping Americans of citizenship rights if they provide
<br>
support to unpopular organizations?&quot;   (My God.)
<br>
<p>4. Providing for summary deportations without evidence of crime, criminal intent or terrorism, even of lawful permanent residents,
<br>
whom the Attorney General says are a threat to national security.  (Section 503)
<br>
<p>&quot;Deporting anyone whatsoever who the Attorney General says?&quot;  Yikes.
<br>
<p>So I delved further into the document where each of these is
<br>
described in more detail.  I found nothing alarming after all.
<br>
Okay, now I've done my part.  You tell me just *where* there
<br>
is something here that we should discuss!
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. Here, for your convenience, are the details
<br>
provided in your URL for each of the above:
<br>
<p>1. Using an overbroad definition of terrorism that could cover tactics used by some protest groups as a predicate for criminal
<br>
wiretapping and other surveillance under Title III  (Sections 120, 121).  Current law provides, at 18 U.S.C. § 2516, a list of
<br>
“predicate offenses” that permit the government to conduct wiretaps and other intrusive surveillance.  The list is quite lengthy,
<br>
but reflects the judgment of Congress that electronic surveillance is a particularly intrusive investigative method that is not
<br>
appropriate for all criminal investigations but should be reserved only for the most serious crimes.
<br>
Title 18 already provides that any terrorism crime defined by federal law is a predicate for Title III surveillance.  See 18 U.S.C.
<br>
§ 2516(q) (providing that any violation of sections 2332, 2332a, 2332b, 2339A, or 2339B is a predicate offense for Title III
<br>
surveillance).  The draft bill, however, extends the predicate even further, to cover offenses that are not defined as terrorism
<br>
crimes under federal law, but do fit the definition of either international or domestic terrorism, i.e., they involve acts that are
<br>
a violation of federal or state law, are committed with the intent of affecting government policy, and are potentially dangerous.
<br>
See 18 U.S.C. § 2331.  It is this broad definition that sweeps in the activities of a number of protest organizations that engage in
<br>
civil disobedience, including People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals and Operation Rescue.  Since true crimes of terrorism are
<br>
already predicates for Title III surveillance, providing this authority is not necessary to listen to the telephone conversations
<br>
and monitor the e-mail traffic of terrorist groups.  To ensure Title III wiretaps are not used to monitor the activities of protest
<br>
organizations, Congress should reject this provision and should also amend the definition of “terrorism.”
<br>
<p><p>2. Permitting searches, wiretaps and surveillance of United States citizens on behalf of foreign governments – including
<br>
dictatorships and human rights abusers – in the absence of Senate-approved treaties.  (Sections 321-22). This section would
<br>
authorize the DOJ to help foreign governments – including those that systematically abuse human rights and do not respect the rule
<br>
of law – invade Americans’ privacy even when the United States Senate has failed or refused to approve a treaty allowing such
<br>
assistance with such a government.  Under current law, the United States does not engage in covert surveillance or issue search
<br>
warrants on behalf of foreign nations unless the Senate has approved a mutual legal assistance treaty.  If a foreign nation with
<br>
which the United States does not have such a treaty requires information from a United States citizen or resident for its own
<br>
judicial process, it may still obtain that information by asking the assistance of a United States district court in issuing an
<br>
order to take testimony or obtain “a document or other thing” under 28 U.S.C. § 1782, but it may not issue search warrants or
<br>
certain surveillance orders.  This limitation ensures that that the Senate consents to more intrusive surveillance on behalf of a
<br>
foreign nation before Americans’ privacy can be invaded at the behest of a foreign government.  The draft bill (at section 321)
<br>
sweeps aside this sensible limitation altogether.
<br>
These limitations on foreign-directed searches, wiretaps and surveillance orders do not need to substantially impede the
<br>
investigation and prosecution of terrorism, as Congress has provided “universal jurisdiction” over many serious terrorism offenses.
<br>
In other words, such offenses are a crime under United States law and subject to U.S. jurisdiction even if committed in a foreign
<br>
nation.  For such offenses, a United States Attorney could obtain the full panoply of searches and surveillance orders to aid in the
<br>
investigation of that crime, even if such a crime was also being investigated by a foreign nation under its own laws.  Such
<br>
information could then easily be shared with the foreign nation, under information sharing provisions approved by Congress in the
<br>
Homeland Security Act.  See Homeland Security Act of 2002, §§ 891-99, Pub. L. No. 107-296, 116 Stat. 2135, 2252-58.
<br>
<p><p>3. Stripping even native-born Americans of all of the rights of United States citizenship if they provide support for “terrorism,”
<br>
allowing them to be indefinitely imprisoned in their own country as undocumented aliens.  (Section 501).  This section would permit
<br>
the government to punish certain criminal activity by stripping even native-born Americans of U.S. citizenship, thereby depriving
<br>
them of any nationality at all and potentially relegating them forever to imprisonment as undocumented immigrants in their own
<br>
country.  Among the activities that could be punished this way are providing material support for an organization – including a
<br>
domestic organization – labeled as a terrorist organization by the government, even if the support was only for the lawful
<br>
activities of that organization.
<br>
The Fourteenth Amendment provides that “All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction
<br>
thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.”  While Americans do have the right to give up
<br>
their citizenship in the United States, the Constitution does not give Congress any power to take away from an American his or her
<br>
status as a citizen even for participating in crime in time of war.  See Trop v. Dulles, 356 U.S. 86 (1958) (conviction by court
<br>
martial of crime of desertion during World War II could not constitutionally lead to loss of citizenship, even though crime was
<br>
committed voluntarily).  Rather, as the Supreme Court has made clear, every citizen of the United States enjoys “a constitutional
<br>
right to remain a citizen . . . unless he voluntarily relinquishes that citizenship.”  Afroyim v. Rusk, 387 U.S. 253 (1967)
<br>
(citizenship could not be forfeited merely by voting in foreign election without the requisite intent to abandon U.S. citizenship).
<br>
While DOJ is correct to observe that certain voluntary acts, such as serving in a foreign army, can serve to terminate U.S.
<br>
citizenship, these “expatriating acts” must indicate some desire to show an affinity with a foreign sovereign.  Only acts that
<br>
indicate such a desire to relinquish American nationality can be made the basis for a finding that strips an American of his or her
<br>
citizenship.  See Vance v. Terrazas, 444 U.S. 252, 262 (1980).
<br>
Moreover, it is the government’s burden to establish that the expatriating act was committed with the intent of relinquishing
<br>
citizenship, a showing this section attempts to short-circuit.  See id. at 261 (holding that the “trier of fact must . . . conclude
<br>
that the citizen not only voluntarily committed the expatriating act prescribed in the statute, but also intended to relinquish his
<br>
citizenship.”)  Expatriating acts are not defined by reference to how repugnant or offensive they are, or by whether they constitute
<br>
serious crimes, but by whether they show the individual has an intent to attach himself or herself to another sovereignty.  Thus,
<br>
while serving in a foreign army or voting in a foreign election may indicate an intent to abandon American nationality, the
<br>
commission of a series of grisly murders, or the control of a vast criminal enterprise plainly do not, although the former are legal
<br>
while the latter are serious crimes.
<br>
Providing support to a terrorist organization, which possesses no sovereignty under international law, is a crime, see 18 U.S.C. §
<br>
2339A, but plainly does not indicate that the individual desires to attach himself or herself to the allegiance of a foreign nation
<br>
or to abandon U.S. citizenship in the way that, for example, serving in a foreign army might.  Indeed, expatriation in the draft
<br>
bill is not even limited to providing material support to foreign terrorist organizations, as wholly domestic organizations can be
<br>
designated as terrorist organizations under 8 U.S.C. § 1182(a)(3).  In addition, expatriation could result from support of
<br>
organizations “engaged in hostilities” against the “national security interests” of the United States – which could mean anything --
<br>
not just against the United States or its people.  Finally, the draft bill would allow expatriation even for support of the lawful,
<br>
humanitarian activities of an organization that the United States has labeled a “terrorist organization,” which belies DOJ’s analogy
<br>
of supporting terrorism by serving in a foreign army engaged in hostilities against the United States.
<br>
<p><p>4. Providing for summary deportations, even of lawful permanent residents, whom the Attorney General says are a threat to national
<br>
security  (Section 503).  Under this provision, any immigrant, including longtime lawful permanent residents, may be expelled from
<br>
the United States on the unilateral determination of the Attorney General that they are a threat to “national security,” which is
<br>
defined as “the national defense, foreign relations, or economic interests of the United States.”  INA § 219(c)(2).  A person facing
<br>
removal under this section will be separated from his or her family and community without ever being able to effectively answer the
<br>
government’s true reasons for labeling him or her a security risk.
<br>
Immigrants and other non-citizens involved in terrorism are deportable under current law,[11] and suspected terrorists are subject
<br>
to mandatory detention during any immigration or criminal proceedings.[12]  The purpose of this amendment is to eliminate due
<br>
process entirely for immigrants, including lawful permanent residents, accused of crimes or terrorism by permitting their expulsion
<br>
merely on the Attorney General’s fiat.  It is based on the fundamentally flawed notion that non-citizens in the United States do not
<br>
possess the right to fair treatment under the law, a notion that the Supreme Court has repeatedly rejected.  See Zadvydas v. Davis
<br>
533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) (reiterating long-standing constitutional rule that “the Due Process Clause applies to all ‘persons’ within
<br>
the United States, including aliens, whether their presence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent”).
<br>
The proposal is another DOJ initiative that flies in the face of President Bush’s stated opposition to the use of secret evidence in
<br>
immigration proceedings on the basis that fair treatment should be afforded everyone in America.  Under the proposal, a non-citizen,
<br>
including a lawful permanent resident, accused of posing a risk to national security could be detained and deported without having
<br>
committed any violation of law and without ever knowing the basis of the accusation against him or her.  The provision would
<br>
essentially authorize a repeat of the “Palmer raids,” a discredited episode in the 1920s that involved widespread mass deportations
<br>
and widespread abuse of the rights of law abiding Russian and other immigrants during a wave of anti-immigrant and nativist
<br>
hysteria.
<br>
DOJ originally asked for this summary deportation power shortly after September 11 in its initial drafts of the USA PATRIOT Act.  It
<br>
was firmly rejected, on a bipartisan basis, by a Congress deeply concerned about the use of secret evidence and core due process in
<br>
immigration proceedings.  It should be rejected again.
