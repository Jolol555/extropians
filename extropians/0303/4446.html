<em>&gt; Then you learn how you have been horribly used to display (single

</em><br>
<p>Obscenity, if the message was obscene and broke some specific ordinance.
<br>
How can someone sign up at a site, drive to a location, receive a letter,
<br>
stand in a particular order to create a string of text, and then claim that
<br>
they didn't know they were transmitting a message?  This scheme is a thin
<br>
disguise.  Obviously, the participants are deliberately trying to set up a
<br>
veil of plausible deniability.  They want to be participants without
<br>
consequences.  The law doesn't recognize this status.
<br>
<p>Banks have an obligation to investigate that large deposits aren't
<br>
laundered.  Couriers across borders have an obligation to make sure they
<br>
aren't smuggling drugs.  People who serve alcohol have an obligation to make
<br>
sure the drinker is old enough.  Parents are supposed to know what their
<br>
children are doing.  Businessmen are supposed to know what their companies
<br>
are doing.  Car owners are supposed to make sure their vehicles are used
<br>
appropriately.  Gun owners are supposed to make sure their guns aren't
<br>
involved in a crime.  Property owners are supposed to make sure that their
<br>
property is safe.
<br>
<p>Deliberately avoiding information about the end consequences of your actions
<br>
does not avoid legal liability.
