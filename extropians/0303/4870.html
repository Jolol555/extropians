<p><em>&gt; &gt; can you imagine that might be of help to the village after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some inventive people *here* --- be they children or not ---
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could really do?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have any real specific examples. I was thinking that the kids 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could discover possible networks that the villagers might normally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offhandedly reject due to sociopolitical structures within the village or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrounding areas.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, things that might be rejected because of the villagers
<br>
cultural &quot;limitations&quot;.  But let's look at one of Spike's
<br>
examples before I unload.
<br>
<p>Spike:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The locals often turned out to be unsuitable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction workers: they had a far too casual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outlook on life, wouldn't show up on time, wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; show up consistently, would wander off the job in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the middle of the day, wouldn't build to any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; semblance of the plan, didn't understand the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; English measurement system, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The idealistic young medical students are driven to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous breakdown, because they cannot seem to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the locals to MOVE!  The locals won't jump to a clock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over there.  Pretty soon the students beg for a work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crew to come over and BUILD something, before their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hitch is over.  Often the result is much mutual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frustration.
</em><br>
<p>One of the truly great things about science fiction
<br>
is that you get to imagine being on the receiving
<br>
end as well as the providing end of a lot of shit.
<br>
<p>So we are compelled to imagine how we would feel in
<br>
the shoes of the villagers with their &quot;limitations&quot;.
<br>
<p>Suppose that your house were suddenly invaded this
<br>
evening by four of the world's greatest self-help
<br>
professionals, all extremely bright who could help
<br>
you spot all the things in your life that are not
<br>
going maximally well.  They would teleport here and
<br>
there throughout your day commenting on this and
<br>
that, suggesting how limited your concepts were of
<br>
what was possible, and trying to get you out of your
<br>
rut and into adopting a more revolutionary attitude
<br>
at every second.  Sometimes they'd have to sit you
<br>
down in a chair and practically brow beat it into
<br>
you.
<br>
<p>The most frightful part is that they would be 
<br>
absolutely right.
<br>
<p>If you could stand listening to them, and if you
<br>
could just try your hardest to learn what they
<br>
were saying and apply it, you'd be a millionaire
<br>
inside two years, have found many, many more
<br>
totally fulfilling relationships with other people
<br>
and groups, and come to live your life to its fullest
<br>
potential.  You'd even lose weight.
<br>
<p>Yet how many of us would press &quot;the button&quot; that would
<br>
allow these four super individuals to descend upon our
<br>
lives in this way?  Even if we intellectually *knew*
<br>
that all that I've said above is totally correct (assume
<br>
for the purposes of argument that it is), who would do
<br>
it?  
<br>
<p>Damn few of us.  So it's the same with all these poor
<br>
&quot;benighted&quot; villagers around the world, who don't see
<br>
the necessity of our hectic work schedules.  Hell, it's
<br>
even true of all the non-extropians that a part of you
<br>
would like to grab by the scruff of the neck, shove
<br>
the Extropian Principles in his face, and scream &quot;SEE?&quot;.
<br>
&quot;HOW CAN YOU NOT **UNDERSTAND** THIS?&quot;.
<br>
<p>Lee
