<p><em>&gt; Looks interesting. Here's a UK review by philosopher Mary Midgley:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/politicsphilosophyandsociety/0,6121,904442,00.html">http://books.guardian.co.uk/reviews/politicsphilosophyandsociety/0,6121,904442,00.html</a>

<p>&quot;Free will is an evolved creation of human activity and beliefs, and it is just as real as such other creations as music and
<br>
money... Recognising our uniqueness as reflective, communicating animals does not require any 'human exceptionalism' that must shake
<br>
a defiant fist at Darwin... We may thus concede that material forces ultimately govern behaviour, and yet at the same time reject
<br>
the notion that people are always and everywhere motivated by material self-interest.&quot;
<br>
<p>As [Dennett] points out, educated people today are often trapped in a strange kind of double-think on this topic. Officially, they
<br>
believe physical science calls for determinism, which proves they have no control over their lives. But in actual living, most of
<br>
the time they assume they do have this control.
<br>
<p><p>Well, would anyone expect less from Dennett?  He's always
<br>
had such an effortless grasp of the essentials.  He and
<br>
Pinker form today's Dynamic-Duo, in my opinion. (Not that
<br>
I find this review especially hard-hitting or to the point
<br>
---see next---but I have confidence that Dennett's book
<br>
will be on target.)
<br>
<p>I think that the people who deny the existence of free
<br>
will simply don't completely understand how extremely
<br>
mechanical the universe is.  They seem to entertain,
<br>
somehow, the possibility of uncaused actions, of freedom
<br>
from mechanism.  It's as if they find the idea of a soul
<br>
conceivable.  Of course there can be no such thing, and
<br>
real free will naturally has nothing to do with such
<br>
ludicrous fantasies.
<br>
<p>Free will exists because it's possible for decisions to
<br>
be made.  A computer program instantly recognizable to
<br>
us as being totally and fully determined nonetheless
<br>
merrily calculates away, letting all the proper influences
<br>
affect its decisions.  And so do we, and in just the same way!
<br>
<p>The absence of free will corresponds to compelled behavior:
<br>
you've chosen to do one thing, and someone else holds a gun
<br>
to your head forcing you to do something else.
<br>
<p>As Pinker himself said in a Stanford lecture a few months
<br>
ago, we easily see that free will exists by noticing that
<br>
people's behavior is affected when you hold them accountable
<br>
for their actions.  That's the whole key.  Get it?  &quot;Whose
<br>
actions!?&quot;  Their actions!
