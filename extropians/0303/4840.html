</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;racist&quot; is rather seriously grasping at straws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't call you a self hating 'miscegenated Frenchman' and don't think 
<br>
that ancestry or even nationality really have a major implication in peoples 
<br>
current views. If you think about it, The Normans conquered England hundreds 
<br>
of years ago. So a large percentile of the UK population and many Americans 
<br>
have French ancestry without realising it.
<br>
<p>As for racist, I do agree that the word was improperly used, as I said in an 
<br>
earlier post criticising its use. To reiterate, Nationalist or tribalist may 
<br>
have been better words, but they didn't convey the sentiment I intended.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; and goes against freedom of speech and democracy. Punishing a nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the political views of its leaders, while damaging your own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  economy is pretty dumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If a nation is democratic, and lives by a majoritarian tyranny system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of government (as France is), it's leaders are acting EXACTLY as their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constituents want them to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily, As a democratic country the leaders are only elected by a 
<br>
majority. Their actions during office are by and large down to their own 
<br>
decisions. This is also the case in the US and the UK, is it not? The only 
<br>
exceptions being when a referendum vote is cast on a given subject by the 
<br>
populus. There was no referendum in the UK regarding actions in Iraq. In the 
<br>
majority of polls taken on the subject a high of 80% against war shows that 
<br>
the action of the government was against the wishes of their constituents. 
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; On a similar note, I hear lots of europeans and others claim they love
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans but hate our government's policy. Turns out that 71%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently support Bush's policy and 78% think the UN is a failure.
</em><br>
<p>No argument on your first point. I assume these are figures of American 
<br>
views? From my vantage point the figures here are very different. I will add 
<br>
that my personal view on the UN. I cannot see how it can be viewed as 'a 
<br>
Failure' simply because it didn't allow the US and UK to act as they pleased 
<br>
or simply disagreed with them. The UN is after all a democratic group that 
<br>
collectively make decisions based on each member states own wants and needs. 
<br>
I will say that the UN does appear to be ineffective in events where time is 
<br>
of the essence. This seems mainly due to the ungainly size and subsequent 
<br>
slowness of the beast. hmmmm
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ur
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government's policy is our own. We own it. Get it? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>And France's policy is its own. So why should you act against them for 
<br>
expressing their views? If it is right and just to boycott French goods and 
<br>
services simply because they didn't agree with our actions. Then we are 
<br>
saying 'if you don't vote the way we want you to, we will punish you' or even 
<br>
simpler 'do as I say or else'?
<br>
Democracy and freedom of speech, this is not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; In contrast, it is easy to hold such a dichotimous view with regards to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq and its people.
</em><br>
