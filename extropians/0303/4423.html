<p>
I think it's unfortunate that the term (in the article) is bonded to 
<br>
'violence and mayhem'. I have been thinking recently of how to 
<br>
distribute legal responsibility and/or provide plausible deniability to 
<br>
network-coordinated protest groups, as in, for example, protest signs of 
<br>
single alphabet characters spelling out obscene/incendiary (o/i) slogans 
<br>
that, if held by individuals, would result in their quick arrest. (It'd 
<br>
be cumbersome to carry around an alphabet of signs, I was thinking some 
<br>
sort of electronic ink or large low-res LCD screens).
<br>
<p>Such slogans might exist only in the eyes of a camera, set for long 
<br>
exposure (a few seconds perhaps). A keen observer might notice 
<br>
something's up, but otherwise the o/i slogan first appears as a jpeg on 
<br>
the web, a clear slogan with a fuzzy crowd. It's missed during the 
<br>
actual protest. Maybe this would work best at night with big LED type signs.
<br>
<p>Of course, at that point you might just as well hold up an array of 
<br>
signs and flash thru the entire alphabet. Separate each sign and letter 
<br>
into photoshop layers and make any slogan you want. The difference 
<br>
between this and just photoshopping over normal protest signs seems 
<br>
quite subtle.
<br>
<p>It would be 'leaderless' since there's no single coordinator, indeed, 
<br>
just program a computer to spit out random o/i slogans and broadcast it 
<br>
to the demonstrators.
<br>
<p>This could be done with chanting, too. Small groups of people (being 
<br>
careful about timing) each chant out one word of a sentence which (if 
<br>
voiced by an individual) would be prosecuted as a death threat or 
<br>
incitement to riot.
<br>
<p>The only connection between such demonstrators would be a single URL 
<br>
which would be abandoned after the event. What are the laws that make a 
<br>
group guilty if every single member of the group is individually innocent?
<br>
<p>Of course, this won't apply if the crowd actually starts rioting itself. 
<br>
Hmmm, maybe a well-disciplined riot-starting seed group that stays 
<br>
nonviolent itself. It could be a weird century of protest :-)
