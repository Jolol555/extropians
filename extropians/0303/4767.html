In general sufficiently advanced weaponry can defeat less advanced
<br>
weaponry quite efficiently, at least in a &quot;fair fight&quot;.  Things
<br>
change when the enemy is doing guerilla warfare. It might simply be
<br>
that the other side in that case must have an even greater tech
<br>
advantage to deal with the guerilla. Maybe the rule of thumb is
<br>
that one techlevel (whatever that is) gives the decisive advantage 
<br>
in a conventional fight and two or more are needed to win an 
<br>
unconventional fight.

&quot;You won't leave us to transcend in peace? You think our research

string disruptor choppers?&quot; :-)

</em><br>
<p>I guess there is a high-tech counter-counter-measure: make the
<br>
lasers flicker psuedorandom identification codes like GPS or even
<br>
public-key based authentification (for the truly paranoid); the
<br>
missile will only follow the right code laser. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is also a clear example on why it is important that these

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think there is some truth in this, but they can of course always 
<br>
sell their technology. But I think there is a problem in 
<br>
*maintaining* high-tech in non-free and poorer countries. Most 
<br>
high-tech requires plenty of high-tech support, and that usually 
<br>
requires freedom of communication. Keeping the engineers and 
<br>
technocrats within the cadre partially ameliorates this, but as 
<br>
Soviet and Iraq demonstrated, the need to keep this group small and 
<br>
contained limits the ability to deploy it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The joker in this, is the rising power of the individual/small state 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due to even more advanced technologies (NABC - Nano, Atomic, Bio, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chem). But the best way to avoid individuals/small states being angry 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to use NABC's as a tool of terror, is to ensure wealth, freedom 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and democracy for as many people as possible.
</em><br>
<p>This is true. The problem is that a happy, rich democratic world 
<br>
only decreases the risk, it cannot remove it. But that is of course 
<br>
no excuse for not doing it anyway. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should this lead to more preemptive strikes, to ensure freedom and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy?
</em><br>
<p>In many ways the aftermath of the current conflict will likely 
<br>
convince people about one or another policy. If it actually goes 
<br>
well, people will start to consider preemtive strikes a reasonable 
<br>
tool. If things turn ugly, they will be less acceptable. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Should we work even harder, and take more chances, to make shure that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a rich and peacefull world before the technology get's to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advanced?
</em><br>
<p>What kind of chances do you think of?
