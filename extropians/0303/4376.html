In a message dated 3/14/2003 7:07:18 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:MaxPlumm@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20PEACE:?%20Gotta%20love%20those%20polls!">MaxPlumm@aol.com</a> writes: I would respectfully disagree with this position. As 
<br>
Lee illustrated, the popular vote has never been the final arbiter of 
<br>
decision in an American election.
<br>
<p>Max,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I paid a lot of attention to the back and forth charges of the past 
<br>
Presidential election.  There were also some explanation of the mechanics of 
<br>
vote counting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to all explanations I saw, the vote is tallied state by 
<br>
state.  As soon as the uncounted vote is small enough that it cannot possibly 
<br>
change the current standing in that state then the vote counting is 
<br>
discontinued.  In other words pretend that in Illinois the vote for President 
<br>
stood at:
<br>
Plumm                                 5.4 Million
<br>
Harrison                               5.0 Million
<br>
Uncounted                            0.3 Million
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under our system the counting would stop.  Even if all 3 million of 
<br>
the uncounted vote went for Harrison then Plumm would still win.  So, it is 
<br>
pointless to continue counting.  The uncounted votes would be thrown away and 
<br>
no one would know what the final was on the popular vote.  We would only know 
<br>
state by state who had won the electoral vote.  In the example cited that 
<br>
would be Plumm.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New bureaus and various politicians would add state by state all the 
<br>
electoral votes to see who had won.  They would also analyze the popular vote 
<br>
in minute detail down to each individual polling place to see what lessons 
<br>
they can learn from the distribution of the vote.  However for the 
<br>
Presidential contest literally millions of votes would go uncounted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result is that we can only truthfully say that at the time the 
<br>
voting stopped Bush had won the electoral vote and Gore was ahead in the 
<br>
popular vote.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However you will find some disappointed people that will seize on 
<br>
their candidate being ahead in the popular vote.  They will and do blur the 
<br>
distinction between ahead and having won the popular vote.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But Max, like many people I worked in that election and I know how 
<br>
psychologically sensitive a person can become to the election's outcome after 
<br>
that person has invested hours of volunteer time to helping their party and 
<br>
its candidates.  Consequently when some person from another party (different 
<br>
from my party) makes a statement that is slightly irresponsible or off the 
<br>
mark I don't begrudge that person their feelings.  In a sense it is a bond.  
<br>
They cared deeply enough to invest their time in the election just as I did.  
<br>
If I whipped them this time that is not to crow about -- they have whipped me 
<br>
often enough and will again.  The people in their wisdom throw us all out 
<br>
from time to time. &lt;G&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, as a Republican that is first an American there is one thing 
<br>
about the situation in Florida that must never be forgotten IMHO.  In a very 
<br>
real sense George Bush did not win because of the U. S. Supreme Court's vote. 
<br>
&nbsp;He won because election workers and judges of state courts in Florida that 
<br>
were Democrat voters in their private capacity ruled time after time in favor 
<br>
of George Bush.  I am saying that those people faced with making a ruling 
<br>
time after time did the ethical thing and followed the law.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Allow me to trust my memory to provide you one example -- I believe 
<br>
the Bush/Gore contests were tried in whole or in part before six different 
<br>
Florida State Courts.  All six courts were controlled by judges that in their 
<br>
private capacity were Democrats.  It is said the Chief Justice of the Florida 
<br>
Supreme Court was a Clinton Campaign Contributor.  Yet, five of the six 
<br>
courts ruled in favor of Bush.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't go into the actual counting except to say I believe election 
<br>
judges from the Democrat Party finally said enough is enough and refused to 
<br>
help Gore past a certain point.  I can't prove that but having watched 
<br>
closely it is the only interpretation that I can make fit what I saw.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me summarize a very lengthy rant. LOL There are crooks aplenty in 
<br>
politics.  But I have seen political workers willing to watch members of 
<br>
their own party get defeated because with their insider knowledge they knew 
<br>
that particular candidate to be a crook.  I believe the system works only 
<br>
because many very decent people work to operate the system legally and 
<br>
fairly.
