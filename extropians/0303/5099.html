<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Anything&quot;?  You are putting forth the interesting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thesis that any act is justified in order to avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; losing a war.  There are pluses to this view, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minuses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Justified is an interesting word.  Perhaps a better term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be &quot;an expected reaction&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>You're right to call it &quot;interesting&quot; --- how about confusing
<br>
and ill-advised?  ;-)  Actually, in the context that I had
<br>
been speaking, I had hoped that it would be understood to 
<br>
connote whatever Cory was personally approving of.  I have
<br>
not succeeded yet in getting Cory to communicate any moral
<br>
outrage about anything (though perhaps I will, if I can 
<br>
remember to get back to answering his last post).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't see much on either side that is justifiable, in any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolute sense.
</em><br>
<p>That's the problem.  It's dreadful terminology.  That's why
<br>
the advanced and beneficent philosophy of PCR comes down 
<br>
against &quot;justificationism&quot; so hard.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In a more limited sense, self-defense is normally recognized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as legitimate.  But as to what should be an expected reaction...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here we get back to theft being a hanging offense.
</em><br>
<p>The trouble one has with your &quot;expected reaction&quot; is that
<br>
your approach seems to be too analytical and devoid of
<br>
emotion in the current case at hand, and also that it is
<br>
obviously going to differ from person to person and from
<br>
group to group.  That is, the &quot;expected reaction&quot; of a
<br>
group of cannibals to some fat person waving a white 
<br>
flag we expect to greatly differ from that of a group of
<br>
Swiss soldiers.  The first group says, &quot;There's one!
<br>
Yum, yum!  Looks like he's even eager!&quot;, whereas the 
<br>
Swiss would have much less of a gut reaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If they see they have nothing to lose [and that's the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correct spelling, for all you amazing people who don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have English for your first language], then one should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect them to do all they can, for revenge if not for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; victory.  
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily true.  What is to be &quot;expected&quot; often 
<br>
does not turn out to be the case, often for very unclear
<br>
reasons.  See my post to Cory later tonight for an example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Once you have killed their children, most people would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have few scruples at violating normal ethics to achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenge.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  In a related thread I offered a choice of what to do
<br>
with Stalin if we did have the technology to resurrect him.
<br>
I sided with Eliezer and others who said that the correct
<br>
choice was to do what was best for him, given a practically
<br>
post-Singularity tech.  Namely, to use a small cubic centimeter
<br>
of matter out near the orbit of Pluto to emulate him having
<br>
a good time with his old pals, reflecting on his life.
<br>
<p>But then, I was not one of Stalin's countless victims, nor
<br>
was any of my family.  If I lived in the year 1953, and he
<br>
had had my family murdered, you betcha I want him to pay,
<br>
even if he's already dead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's one of the most powerful motivators that people have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you had better expect it if you go in for mass bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of civilian locations.  
</em><br>
<p>Oh?  Here is a counter-example.  The British (and Americans)
<br>
ruthlessly bombed to utter destruction the city of Dresden
<br>
in World War Two for no military reason whatsoever, just to
<br>
&quot;weaken&quot; the German will to resist.  So when the war ended
<br>
a few months later, where was the revenge that *you* would
<br>
expect?  It never, never happened.  Where, even, were the
<br>
cries that the British should be tried as war criminals?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And we haven't been as scrupulous as we were claiming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would be.
</em><br>
<p>Are you speaking of the present war?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So we had better expect extreme reactions by some reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraction of the populace.
</em><br>
<p>Not proved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In short, they've got good reason to hate our guts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Thank you, Mr. President.)
</em><br>
<p>My God, if one cannot even predict the reactions of Germans 
<br>
after defeat---and you better believe that one hell of a lot more
<br>
of them supported Hitler than Iraqis support Saddam---and this
<br>
in a nation (Germany) vastly, vastly more similar to you than
<br>
the Arab countries, then you have no idea of what to expect or
<br>
exactly what flavor of hatred the current war is inspiring.
<br>
Who knows?  Life is valued so differently in that part of the
<br>
world, and perhaps even the adage &quot;might makes right&quot; could
<br>
be so differently valued, that I must dispute your statement.
