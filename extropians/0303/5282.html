Lee,
<br>
<p>the arguments between us fail at the point where you seem to have a hard
<br>
time to imagine the implications of a new situation (for example the
<br>
possible impacts of Patriot Act 2). Your apparent lack of imagination seems
<br>
to be the cause that you do not feel any emotional reaction when watching
<br>
the war pictures or hearing the news of casualties and war crimes on
<br>
*both* sides.
<br>
<p>If you cannot understand that I am against the US/UK troops *and* against
<br>
Saddam Hussein at the same time you will probably have a hard time to
<br>
understand my emotional rage when I see this poor figure who happens to be
<br>
your President, this false smile and his phony religious thunder he uses to
<br>
recruit new cannon fodder - last night --- afternoon, US time - with the
<br>
vets on the stage. That made me wanna puke.
<br>
<p>As I have already explained before: the low taste here on the list is
<br>
produced by those who cold-bloodedly accept the cruelties any war brings
<br>
along and who calculate on the deaths of the soldiers of their own party and
<br>
don't even feel sorry for that. THIS is truly low taste and really
<br>
disgusting, not my absolutely harmless joke on lubricating the US war
<br>
machine with the puke of war protesters. You may find my innocent 4letter
<br>
word tasteless, that's fine with me, but what can be more tasteless than
<br>
this current war on Iraq?
<br>
<p>&quot;Puke puke puke puke - dirty dirty dirty dirty&quot; *jumps like a Monty Python
<br>
actor to show his despair and powerlessness*
<br>
<p>For future debates: I am just a worthless jester who plays the abstract and
<br>
the visceral card with the same intensity. And I am so glad to be able to be
<br>
a little unstable from time to time instead of being such a tough guy you
<br>
appear to be. The other day you labeled those who are against the war as
<br>
*Traitors* now that the war had begun. So please count me in as one. I'd
<br>
love to be a traitor if you define it this way.

Subject: RE: First Announcement of the Secretary of PUKE (Explicit words!
<br>
Uglier than WAR)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Hubert writes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is the first official announcement of the Secretary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of PUKE (Professional Uplifting Killing Experience)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bring your personal throw up to the local PC!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; May I ask what is the purpose of bringing the taste of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forum to a new low?  Have you completely abandoned even the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretence of decorum and civility here?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; From today on everybody who feels like he has to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; puke when watching Fuehrer George Troubleyou Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; addressing the US army,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What makes you think that you have some prerogative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; play the Hitler-card?  Does it never occur to you that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name calling ought to have no place here?  In three
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posts in a row, you have gone way out of your way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express your extreme emotional overreactions.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not at all sure just what to say...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I'll put out a more general question.  How is it that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a current member of the nation of Germany, who has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history on this list of having engaged in a number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstract conversations, is so traumatized by what he's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seeing or hearing that he's coming to behave as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-anointed &quot;secretary of PUKE&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now were he directly involved (say he lived in Iraq, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had lost family members in terrorist bombings, or had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known friends who died at the hands of the armed services
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the United States), then I might understand.  But as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, I simply don't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So perhaps we should all ask ourselves:  Just what would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to happen to us to force us off the edge the way it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has Hubert?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Would one have to work in a Hospital emergency room?  Would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one have to interview rape victims for a living?  Would one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to suffer the actual deprivations of combat, or, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse, live as a civilian in a combat zone?  For the life of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me, I can't quite see how watching television would ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring me to the crisis that Hubert is evidently experiencing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just what manner of international incident, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were my own nation not involved, or descriptions of world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; catastrophes consuming millions of lives would bring this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out in me?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that some here have expressed wishes of pity for him,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it's unclear how sincere these were.  (For me, I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really sure that he himself is suffering that much, or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely confident that he's as emotionally overwrought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the degree it appears.)  However, I can advise him to stand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back from that which may be distressing him so much;  perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a few days or weeks, and try to regain a little stability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, there might be other lists on which he could vent his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions and coarse metaphors?  Eh?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or US /UK war criminals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; killing Iraqi civilians might bring his warmest throw up to his local PC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (Puke Container) where the community's collective stomach contents will
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gathered and sent to the White House in Washington, D.C., USA as our
</em><br>
live
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stream contribution to this glorious crusade of God's own country.
</em><br>
