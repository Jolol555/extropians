<em>&gt; I think for some reason people are not reading or responding to things I

</em><br>
<p>Someone once remarked that the best posts never got replies - everybody
<br>
agrees, and don't feel up to responding in kind. The worst posts cause
<br>
flames or an embarrased silence. And the mediocre just roll on. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will people all across the world start to feel powerless? Already I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question the amount of impact one person can really make in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I often wonder if these great technologies such as AI and nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will make a &quot;power elite&quot; in the world. That the people that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand and control these technologies will have the real political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power. 1)that these will decide who has the military and economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; superiority 2) that these people will be able to use these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies directly to give themselves even more power
</em><br>
<p>Reminds me a bit of the discussion in
<br>
<a href="http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/31/knowledge/index.html">http://www.salon.com/tech/feature/2003/03/31/knowledge/index.html</a> But as
<br>
he points out, it is very much a cultural thing. One of the more
<br>
interesting things one can learn from the failure of marxist thought and
<br>
the study of social psychology, is how much the power distribution in a
<br>
society does not hinge on material factors. The real issue is whether
<br>
any new technologies would empower elites to a greater extent than
<br>
ordinary people. Information technology does not seem to have that
<br>
effect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did previous technologies create a power elite group? I would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say that the few people who knew how to build a nuke in 1945 could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have had substantial power if they didn't already. Although the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear technology didn't make that big of an impact in nonmilitary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas. Also the nuclear technology in no way could be used to directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit an individual.
</em><br>
<p>How much power could Oppenheimer, Sakarov and Teller really wield?  None
<br>
of them could have made themselves president. The answer seem to be that
<br>
their knowledge just gave them some leverage in terms of connecting with
<br>
the elite, and the power of the elite was not increased tremendously
<br>
even by nuclear weapons (the power distance of people in the US hardly
<br>
increased during the postwar period; maybe the worldwide power distance
<br>
did increase). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I fear that the world could enter a stage where a small percentage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people less than .1% could control over 99% of the world. 1) only the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elite will be given the latest upgrades, nano machines
</em><br>
<p>Given by who? Are you not making a lot of hidden assumptions about what
<br>
kind of society this happens in? I suggest that you try to spell out the
<br>
assumed background society, then we can start analysing whether this
<br>
will happen or whether the society itself is likely to come about. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) only the elite will be able to control AI to any extent
</em><br>
<p>Will be able or will be allowed? Again, the Salon article makes a good
<br>
point about current security paranoia and educational failures pushing
<br>
towards elitism. But again, we have to look at underlying assumptions
<br>
about the nature of the society and elite to really be able to say
<br>
whether this is likely or not (or good/bad).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eventually all jobs will be of the advanced technologies performed by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highest AI systems those may or may not incorporate human minds.
</em><br>
<p>Do you think a super AI finds cleaning floors fun? And how much does it 
<br>
want in salary?
