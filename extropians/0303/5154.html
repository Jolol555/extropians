<p>&quot;As the most obtrusive figure the US can expect to gain the most scrutiny.
<br>
By and large we've done pretty well, especially in a historical context, but
<br>
I don't expect people to notice that.&quot;
<br>
AND
<br>
&quot;Actually, in many place the US has made things worse.  It does have such a
<br>
history.&quot;
<br>
<p>Which is it, does it have a history of making things worse, or has it 'by
<br>
and large done pretty well'?
<br>
<p>&quot;You can argue all you want that it could have been much worse, but ensuring
<br>
a large number of survivors who have been grossly damaged by you is going to
<br>
make you LOTS of enemies.&quot;
<br>
AND
<br>
&quot;People that you kill aren't going to hurt you.&quot;
<br>
<p>So you would basically prefer that the US just outright Nuke baghdad, and
<br>
therefore just kill people they would otherwise just make angry?
<br>
<p>&quot;I consider this war to be immoral from the start, but I also consider that
<br>
it's being conducted in a way that is almost designed to create a large
<br>
number of bitter enemies.&quot;
<br>
<p>That being said, which manner would you prefer it be conducted (if it is to
<br>
be conducted anyway), massive civilian causalties, or taking great care to
<br>
reduce such casualties?  You seem to merely acknowledge the different
<br>
manners, but not state which you would prefer.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;No, we did not &quot;put him in originally.&quot; We certainly did aid his regime in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his war against the Iranians. But so what? That fact alone does not look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that decision in any historical perspective nor does it prohibit us from
</em><br>
our
<br>
<em>&gt;current action. We heavily aided the Soviet Union during World War II, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporary alliance that gave way to inevitable conflict when our common
</em><br>
enemy
<br>
<em>&gt;had been vanquished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;I think you are wrong about that, though I'll need to check.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yeah, I think you do need to check that.
<br>
<p>&quot;If we didn't put him in, then we have even less moral standing in removing
<br>
him... so from my point of view, you are
<br>
saying that I've been giving the US too much credit for moral justification
<br>
for this war.&quot;
<br>
<p>No, I believe he is saying that your assumptions are not true.  And why you
<br>
would place 'we put him there' as a greater moral justification for removing
<br>
him than 'he has murdered 200,000 people' is beyond me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;suggest that the amount of civilian casualties will approach any where near
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the number of Iraqi deaths Hussein's regime is responsible for. It is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&quot;It makes a big difference who is doing the vile things.  If we are doing
<br>
it, then it is our responsibility.  If we are supporting their bein done,
<br>
then it is partially our responsibility.  If we aren't doing them, then it
<br>
isn't our responsibility. &quot;
<br>
<p>You omit the next possible logical scenerio, we sit by and allow it to
<br>
happen.  Is that moral?  Your basic stance appears to be 'who cares what
<br>
goes on in the world, as long as we arent doing any bad things'  Do you also
<br>
draw that same distinction at a personal level?  &quot;who cares what other
<br>
people do, as long as I am a good person&quot;  Why make the distinction between
<br>
the behavior of states and that of people?
<br>
<p>&quot;We might reasonably assist someone requesting our aid.&quot;
<br>
<p>And if they are unable to request it because they will be beaten, raped,
<br>
gased, tortured, or executed?  Plenty of exiles have requested our
<br>
assistance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;logical to assume that the number of those butchered by that regime will
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt;continue to grow. The UN has done nothing to abate this situation. They did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing to stop genocide in Cambodia, Laos, Ethopia, the Soviet Union,
</em><br>
China,
<br>
<em>&gt;Rwanda, and a ton of other locales in the world. Are you suggesting that
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;limited number of 1000-6000 (the estimates in Afghanistan) is worse than
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;continued mass murder that will be inflicted on the Iraqis by Hussein and
</em><br>
his
<br>
<em>&gt;heirs apparent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;There are many massacres occuring in the world.  Are you suggesting that we
<br>
should invade and destroy whereever they might be about to occur, or have
<br>
recently occured?  Seriously?  And you are considering that this is not only
<br>
moral, but demanded by morality?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, to think that if we have a reasonable cause to suspect a mass murder,
<br>
genocide, democide, or similar event is about to occur and that we should do
<br>
nothing about it is absolutely immoral.  If you were to watch your neighbor
<br>
get beaten and butchered while you were cleaning your handgun, would you
<br>
consider it moral to sit idly by?  I dont know what strange convention of
<br>
morality you abide that that *requires* you to do nothing to help others
<br>
when you are perfectly capable of helping them.
<br>
<p>Why draw a distinction when 'states' are involved.  Especially when one
<br>
state is a representation of its people and embraces freedom and individual
<br>
rights, while the other is headed by a murderous tyrannical dictator.  Such
<br>
a state is not a valid or moral state in the *first* place, Saddam has no
<br>
*right* to rule Iraq as he does not respect the rights of his own people.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm sorry, but that's not the way my morality points.&quot;
<br>
<p>Your own admitted morality point you to not care what else occurs in the
<br>
world as long as you are a good person.
