I think you're on to something here. Not the prevelance of the Tithonus meme
<br>
in particular, but the fun, sexy, extended youth (and all that goes with it)
<br>
part of life extension. After all, a lot of health consumables are sold,
<br>
sitting on the back of these concepts. Hmm. I'll have to weave that one into
<br>
my efforts.
<br>
<p>In fact, I'm of a mind to make it the topic of my next Longevity Meme
<br>
newsletter, with a big credit at the base saying &quot;thank you Damien and Spike
<br>
for all ideas about youth and sex&quot; :) (Heh).

<em>&gt; &gt;After talking to a lot of people about life extension,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and occasionally about cryonics, I see a disturbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pattern.  Few are interested in either, but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;because they believe methods will not work, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rather because they generally aren't having enough *fun*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's *exactly* right. People seem by and large to be having a fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awful time, especially as the aches and poor vision and bad sleep and poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digestion of later years start to seep in. `What, more of *this*?'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The world gets murky. Doing the simplest thing becomes a hassle, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; joys to be had from it are lessened.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many of the posters on this list are too young to know from the inside how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tedious and dispiriting that is. Trust me. If older people get the idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (mistakenly in the longer term but valid right now) that life extension
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means *more of this crap*, it isn't at all like a healthy young adult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreseeing decades or centuries more of raves, waves, delirious sex, mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bending transmitteri, movies and books you haven't already seen in essence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a hundred times... It's like going to grey work on a Monday morning in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smog, with aching teeth and a cold, for the rest of eternity. That's on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good day. Luckily I'm not at that point yet (except on a *bad* day), but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can empathize all too readily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have to sell the idea of extended or recovered *youthfulness*. On the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face of it, that's about as plausible as Jesus Saves or Qi Energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saves--less, though, because it lacks the misty supernatural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pizzazz escape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clauses of faith. To the extent that we sincerely expect scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances to produce these benefits, we have to back up our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good-times-are-coming spiel with sober evidence. That's hard.
