<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Ad hominem is *never* correct, John.
</em><br>
<p>Second (PCR and de Bono-steeped) thoughts:
<br>
<p>Boiling it down, I think my position is that cross-commentary or &quot;debate&quot; 
<br>
public ad hominem is usually regrettable but can have a useful or even 
<br>
laudable strategic use if the target truly does deserve to be depissed or 
<br>
discredited on the basis of it. It's a &quot;credentials&quot; thing. &quot;No matter how 
<br>
good his arguments might sound, the grounds of his thinking toward his 
<br>
argument--/his/ /qualities/--make him suspect. He doesn't use words to mean 
<br>
what we think they mean.&quot; Etc.
<br>
<p>Criticisms of what I just suggested:
<br>
<p>1) Justifying that &quot;deserve[dness]&quot; might require omniscience.
<br>
&nbsp;2) Blinding the bull doesn't take away his horns (The Hannity duck-out 
<br>
about the Korea Axis-O-Eviolll thing was Hannity tossing sand in the bull's 
<br>
eyes, for sure).
<br>
<p>3) Even justified ad hominem incurs costs, and those costs can be large. -- 
<br>
One can demonize almost anyone and it can be hard to get out of the habit 
<br>
once it's formed. -- Its use always contributes some tarnish to your own 
<br>
credentials in some quarters.
<br>
<p>MMB
<br>
<p><pre>
-- 
I am not here to have an argument. I am here as part of a civilization. 
Sometimes I forget.
