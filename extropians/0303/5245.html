For the MTV-ers, probably would have just switched channels. But it may have 
<br>
activated the coalition of the willing. As far as the war protestors, the 
<br>
communist ANSWER folkies; nothing Saddam has done was ever protestable, the 
<br>
same with Humania's Teachers and Students. When America moves, it blood in 
<br>
the streets; when Iraq or Yugoslavia cut down tens of thousands, its 
<br>
non-actionable. With this war, America will get to know its friends and 
<br>
enemies. It will be up to the American people to hold our politicians the 
<br>
dedication of rewarding friends and ruining enemies. (drool, the moon is 
<br>
full!)
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Its unfortunate for the members of society who support the effort to remove
<br>
the murderous dictator Saddam Hussain from power that the 200,000 -
<br>
1,000,000 people he executed, killed, raped, or tortured were not
<br>
videotaped, since apparently it takes a photograph or personalized narrative
<br>
for the true impact of the horror of the loss of a life to sink in to some
<br>
people.  For all the descriptions you post of Iraqi civilian causalties,
<br>
there are a thousand stories untold, unphotographed, and unvideotaped from
<br>
Saddam's reign of terror.  I wonder how the current vote of the MTV
<br>
counterculture would have fared had these attrocities been videotaped.&gt;&gt;
