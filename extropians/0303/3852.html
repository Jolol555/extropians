<p>This is true. And attempting to get the government to enforce &quot;better 
<br>
health&quot; might be a risky direction to move in - after all, many of the 
<br>
things we are considering could be regarded as &quot;alternate health&quot;.
<br>
<p>I think the problem is similar to the one in Wright's _The Golden Age_:
<br>
there technology has advanced to such a degree that anybody can rewrite
<br>
themselves almost completely. So what is to keep people from accidentally or
<br>
&quot;it seemed like a good idea at the time&quot;-deliberately destroying themselves
<br>
in various ways? In the novel the fundamentally libertarian society
<br>
abstained from coercing people, even to save them from making these mistakes
<br>
(it could still prevent people from attacking *each other*). But a social
<br>
institution, the Hortators, was created to help people live a virtuous/good
<br>
life by exhorting them to behave and introducing social sanctions against
<br>
improper or overly self-destructive behavior. This is in many ways similar
<br>
to how Iain M. Banks' Culture is described dealing with crime and criminal
<br>
behavior.
<br>
<p>Obesity is hardly mental self-mutilation, but it is the same kind of
<br>
problem: a habit that reduces the potential to live one's own life to its
<br>
fullest. Even when we factor in thrifty genes, metabolism, hypothalamic
<br>
set-points and other metabolic reasons one's weight is a function of what
<br>
one eats and hence regulatable through our own actions. It is just that we
<br>
need to acquire those habits that make our weights ideal for our purposes.
<br>
Note that the ideal weight is individual and tied to that person's life
<br>
project; this is why government intervention is so risky (what about people
<br>
who need to eat much? or want to eat much?).
<br>
<p>Maybe the proper approach is the Hortators, a social infrastructure that
<br>
helps us maintain our ideal caloric intakes. The current situation is mostly
<br>
a simplistic &quot;calories are bad, fat is bad&quot; puritan bias in one direction
<br>
that at most produces guilt. A better infrastructure would encompass an
<br>
understanding of how our bodies are individual projects (making both the
<br>
obese person happy with his fat and the bodybuilder aiming for total
<br>
definition totally acceptable and no challenge to each other) and a sense of
<br>
how to encourage successful living in each other. That is of course a tall
<br>
order, but it would be applicable to many other &gt;H fields. 
<br>
<p>Of course, any biomedical toy that could help us control weight would be 
<br>
welcome, and would make this issue far less controversial. Xenical is a 
<br>
small first step.
