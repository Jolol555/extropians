Damien at Cal Tech claimed:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Wow.  Ad hominem on the scale of whole nations.  German and Japanese
<br>
opposition I suppose you'll dismiss because of WWII.  The British, what, too
<br>
socialist?  Ditto for the Canadians, despite all the peacekeeping troops they
<br>
send out.  Eastern European opposition, despite their usually being our best
<br>
friends these days on account of deep appreciation for our role in the Cold
<br>
War, doesn't matter because...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Nations act out of perceived self-interest, is this a surprise? Also, no 
<br>
nation that you mentioned experienced a 9-11. So I am guessing the majorities 
<br>
think that the US should worry about it, not them.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Do you really think hundreds of thousands of people are protesting, and the
<br>
poll results are so opposed, because of oil?  French and Russian governmental
<br>
concern for oil contracts I could believe.  But we're talking about the
<br>
popular opinion of a majority of the First World.  When they say that bad as
<br>
Iraq is it's not worth a war, when they question the claims of WMDs and of
<br>
support for terrorists, asking for more evidence than forged and plagiarised
<br>
documents, how are you so sure you can dismiss them?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My response is that yes, a lot of these other countries are interested in 
<br>
lining their pockets. That like the French, they have a psychological need 
<br>
for another &quot;super power&quot; to &quot;counter-balance the US. That anti-Americanism 
<br>
has become the latest fashion in hatred, long before 9-11 happend of Bush jr. 
<br>
got put in office. That your accusation of forged and plaguerized docs seems 
<br>
incorrect.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Oh, economic costs.  I'd interpreted the claim about burdens we bore alone 
<br>
as
<br>
referring to lack of moral support.  Yes, we've spent 3x as much of our GDP 
<br>
on
<br>
the military, and tended to have a bigger GDP, especially shortly after WWII.
<br>
-xx- Damien X-) &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>No, the US Taxpayer spent the costs in people and material, not the 
<br>
Bundeswehr, not the Royal Navy, not the Norwegian Air Force. The United 
<br>
States footed the bill, far and  above and beyond was was allocated to Nato, 
<br>
during the cold war. This was decades after WW2, right through the 1990's.
