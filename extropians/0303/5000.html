Amara responded to Matus:
<br>
<p>&quot;For me, it takes too much energy to talk about that
<br>
here, fighting against narrow-minded views and I see little interest
<br>
with these people to look into it further and study the sources&quot;
<br>
<p>So instead, you would simply label those with a differing opinion with 
<br>
descriptions that one could just as easily use to describe your position?
<br>
<p>&quot;My personality doesn't relish fighting in general, and my hands
<br>
don't have the typing ability, and it is not worth my time in general.
<br>
I see too many knee-jerk responses here. The answer is to set up
<br>
kill-files, but I have the same psychological blocks with using
<br>
kill-files as those discussed by Emlyn.&quot;
<br>
<p>I cannot hope to judge all of the posts you refer to here, not knowing all of 
<br>
the many that you have no doubt read. However, in terms of Matus's response 
<br>
to you, it is simply not appropriate. He brought up legitimate concerns with 
<br>
your position on the Afghan War, to which you responded quite rudely that he 
<br>
should &quot;read some history&quot; and that you would not &quot;read or respond to this 
<br>
thread anymore&quot;. If that is not a &quot;knee-jerk response&quot;, I don't know what is. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;The title of the message is of course, referring to what the Afghan
<br>
people called the invasion of the Soviets in 1979. How many millions
<br>
disappeared? Nobody knows.&quot;
<br>
<p>Strange how that is always a feature of Communist governments.
<br>
<p>&quot;By the crudest estimates, some 10 million
<br>
Afghans by 1986 no longer existed and a generation of Afghans mostly
<br>
gone (dead, in prisons, in refugee camps, escaped to the west). The
<br>
largest population of refugees in the 1980s were the Afghan
<br>
population. The world was very silent during this time.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hardly unique, unfortunately, especially during that era. The world was 
<br>
equally silent about the hell inflicted on the peoples of Indochina when the 
<br>
Communist &quot;peace&quot; came in 1975.
<br>
<p>&quot;Please read some history and please talk to some Afghan refugees
<br>
from that time. There is no better source than the people who were
<br>
actually there.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;A history note:
<br>
The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979. The Afghans fought
<br>
them with little help, surprisingly successively for a large
<br>
part of that war. Please look to Soviet sources or talk to Russians
<br>
for how difficult of a time the Soviets were having.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is simply not the case. Perhaps it is inspiring for people to believe 
<br>
that tyranny was abated with only sticks and rocks, but that is at best 
<br>
wishful thinking. The United States, China, and Israel provided crucial arms 
<br>
to the rebels throughout the war. I would suggest that it is you who should 
<br>
read further on this topic. To start, here is an excerpt from James Mann's 
<br>
About Face: A History of America's Curious Relationship With China, from 
<br>
Nixon to Clinton. p. 136
<br>
<p>&quot;Nothing could better symbolize the depth of the intelligence cooperation 
<br>
between America and China in the 1980's than the Afghan Mules.
<br>
After the invasion of Afghanistan in 1979, the United States launched its 
<br>
biggest covert intelligence operation since World War II, aimed at supporting 
<br>
the moujeheddin rebels in their guerrilla war against the Soviet forces. The 
<br>
CIA, working closely with Pakistan's intelligence service, rushed to arm, 
<br>
train and support the Afghan resistance.
<br>
<p>China was a partner in these clandestine operations. Starting with CIA 
<br>
Director Stansfield Turner's visit to Beijing in late 1980, American and 
<br>
Chinese intelligence agencies had established a formal working relationship. 
<br>
China, like the United States, was happy to see the Soviet Union bogged down 
<br>
in a protracted war, one that might teach Moscow the dangers of trying to 
<br>
expand its power in Asia.
<br>
<p>One of the main logistical problems for the moujeheddin was finding ways to 
<br>
distribute arms and ammunition to its fighting units. Soviet forces 
<br>
controlled the roads and the air. For resupply, the Afghan rebels relied on 
<br>
pack animals, moving overland at night. As the fighting in Afghanistan 
<br>
intensified, the moujeheddin discovered that there simply weren't enough 
<br>
four-legged animals inside the country to support their operations. The 
<br>
rebels desperately needed mules. 
<br>
<p>Enter America and China. The CIA studied briefly the possibility of 
<br>
transporting mules from the United States to Afghanistan, but finally decided 
<br>
that the idea wouldn't work; transportation was expensive, and American mules 
<br>
weren't sturdy enough. Instead, the CIA turned to its Chinese partners and 
<br>
agreed to buy thousands of Chinese mules. Chinese intelligence officials 
<br>
arranged to have the mules bred inside China and then marched along the 
<br>
Karakoram Highway, the route of the old Silk Road, from Xinjiang Province in 
<br>
far western China into Pakistan. There, the mules were laden with mortars, 
<br>
machine guns, rocket launchers, and other guns and ammunition and sent on 
<br>
another journey into Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>While the mules were the symbol of the Sino-American intelligence cooperation 
<br>
on Afghanistan, arms were the substance of it. Chinese intelligence supplied 
<br>
many of the weapons used by the moujeheddin, under a similar agreement with 
<br>
the CIA: The United States paid the costs, and China supplied the goods.&quot;
<br>
<p>He continues on p. 137:
<br>
<p>&quot;Furthermore, the Chinese arms enabled the CIA to maintain the fiction that 
<br>
the United States was not supplying the Afghan resistance. Through the first 
<br>
half of the 1980s, it was official American policy to make sure that the 
<br>
weapons used by the moujeheddin came from Communist countries, so that the 
<br>
Soviet Union could not accuse the United States of direct involvement in the 
<br>
war.
<br>
<p>The CIA obtained some of the arms it needed for Afghanistan from Egypt, which 
<br>
had stocks of Soviet-built weaponry. In addition, the agency found that 
<br>
Israel was happy to sell some of the Soviet-made weapons it had captured 
<br>
during the war in Lebanon; the Afghan moujeheddin didn't realize that their 
<br>
jihad against the Soviet forces was being fought with the indirect help of 
<br>
the Israelis.
<br>
<p>Despite these other sources of supply, however, the overwhelming share of the 
<br>
CIA's arms purchases for Afghanistan, particularly during the early stages of 
<br>
the war, came from China. At the Pakistani port of Karachi, Chinese ships 
<br>
unloaded cargoes of small arms, assault rifles, mines, anti-tank and 
<br>
anti-aircraft guns, rocket launchers and 107 mm rockets. Mohammed Yousaf, the 
<br>
general who headed Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) Directorate 
<br>
operations to supply the moujeheddin, estimated that the Afghan resistance 
<br>
received 10,000 tons of weapons in 1983. The arms supplies increased year by 
<br>
year to a level of 65,000 tons n 1987, with most of the shipments coming from 
<br>
China, Yousaf later wrote. By some estimates, China made $100 million a year 
<br>
through its weapons sales to the CIA.&quot;
<br>
<p>As you noted Amara, who better to tell the tale than those who lived it?
<br>
<p>&quot;The U.S weapons to the Afghan fighters were not until some
<br>
7 or 8 years later.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is true that American weapons were not given to the Afghan rebels until 
<br>
relatively late in the war, but the US had been arming the moujeheddin from 
<br>
the very start. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We all know how that turned out, don't we?&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes we do, the Soviet Union was bogged down and did not achieve its goal of 
<br>
expanding its empire into Afghanistan.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, it's lovely to have two superpowers using an innocent
<br>
people for their political goals.&quot;
<br>
<p>It's even lovelier when someone suggests, as you seem to be doing here, that 
<br>
the goals and moral validity of the United States and the Soviet Union were 
<br>
of equal merit. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I will stop responding to and reading this thread, now.&quot;
<br>
<p>If it is your general policy to make hit and run attacks, as you did on 
<br>
Matus, without waiting to have your position debated, then that is fine. But 
<br>
I feel that you are ultimately doing yourself a disservice to wrap yourself 
<br>
in a blanket of complete self-assurance on these complex matters.
<br>
