Someone wrote:.  I have no interest at all in being a an emaciated
<br>
exercise-obsessed 120-year-old human; I want to be a 1000-year-old sexy
<br>
glutton.
<br>
<p>leaving aside the point that we would all like to have our cake and eat it
<br>
too, from a strictly practical point of view, the path to a 1000 year old
<br>
glutton may be through a 120 yr old emaciated exercise obsessed human -
<br>
YET - the extropian movement does need to be &quot;sexy&quot; and attractive and not
<br>
imply too much personal deprivation, or else it won't catch on (in &quot;time&quot;
<br>
anyway). If it doesn't catch on, the mortalists rule, money is spent on the
<br>
military instead of medicine, cars instead of cures, and lots of other A vs
<br>
B tradeoffs that can be crudely reduced to slogans.
<br>
<p>REQUEST FOR REPLY - My idea of an extropian lifestyle is a form of &quot;long-run
<br>
ascetic hedonism&quot;. Perhaps someone could offer a better term tho - the idea
<br>
is this: minimize consumption expenditures given a set of constraints which
<br>
are individually determined to be the minimums necessary for the emotional
<br>
and psychological (and therefore, to some extent, physical) well being of
<br>
the individual. That is the ascetic part - the hedonist part is to liberate
<br>
ourselves, to a degree, from anachronistic cultural, psychological, social,
<br>
legal and instinctual constraints on our behavior which make us unhappy and
<br>
therefore unhealthy - these constraints also, of course, make us unhealthy
<br>
directly by increasing addictive &amp; palliative habits - like eating lots of
<br>
fat, alcohol consumption, driving fast/around, smoking etc.. Imelda Marcos'
<br>
2,000+ shoes may be a function of her &quot;gatherer&quot; genes or something more
<br>
sexy like penis envy or genuine horniness- but the direction these
<br>
(unrecognized?) tendencies was distorted by consumerist culture. An ascetic
<br>
hedonist would advise her to stop buying shoes out the shoes and take on a
<br>
gardener. (I dunno tho, that would indeed be one expensive gardener ;-) But
<br>
the shoe lobby would rather prostitution be illegal ;-)
