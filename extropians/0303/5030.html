</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think that you've touched on a very deep point here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, here, most Iraqis must know that they cannot win
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against any one of the coalition nations in an all out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war, let alone all of them.  If to them, being overrun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the infidels or western imperialists, or whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; association the may rightly or wrongly have, is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst fate, then they logically must do anything they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can to circumvent this.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Anything&quot;?  You are putting forth the interesting
<br>
thesis that any act is justified in order to avoid
<br>
losing a war.  There are pluses to this view, and
<br>
minuses.
<br>
<p>On the plus side, should the U.S. have subverted
<br>
allegedly democratically elected governments in
<br>
order to thwart the U.S.S.R.'s plans, should the
<br>
British have killed a number of innocent people
<br>
in a number of wars just to prevent an fleet of
<br>
ships from falling into enemy hands?  Should a
<br>
nation torture a captive if it's the only way
<br>
that appears to hold out any hope of averting a
<br>
holocaust?
<br>
<p>I would make a tentative &quot;yes&quot; to the above questions.
<br>
Context must always be considered.  I will take the
<br>
usually dangerous route of expressing an allegiance
<br>
to complete utilitarianism now, and say that a course
<br>
is &quot;justified&quot; if it will lead to the best results in
<br>
the long run.  Perhaps you don't find that maxim too
<br>
unobjectionable in the present discussion.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I would suggest that if the U.S., for example,
<br>
captures an Al Qaeda terrorist who knows where an atom
<br>
bomb in New York city is hidden, then torture the hell
<br>
out of him, I say, in order to learn where.  But if the
<br>
U.S. captures an Iraqi soldier who knows where the 
<br>
concentrations of chemical weapons are stored, then 
<br>
torturing the information out of him is not justified.
<br>
The reason, approximately, is that soldier are supposed
<br>
(these days) to be prepared to meet chemical weapons.
<br>
The proximate reason is that there are conventions of
<br>
war (so called &quot;rules of war&quot;, I gather, about which
<br>
I know very little), and I believe that torturing enemy
<br>
soldiers is always against those rules.
<br>
<p>Here also is another governing principle:  &quot;What is going
<br>
to happen anyway?&quot;  I know that that doesn't sound like
<br>
a principle ;-)  but it is!   Suppose that I'm an American
<br>
captain, and the U.S. is being overrun by the Germans and
<br>
Japanese in the final days of World War II.  I am one of
<br>
the few commanders left in the Ozarks, our last refuge.
<br>
In a daring move, we take over a Japanese supply train,
<br>
and my Colonel orders me to kill all the truck drivers
<br>
because we cannot afford to leave them behind us.  But
<br>
if I can now tell with utter moral *certainty* that our
<br>
cause is lost, and it really won't do any good anyway,
<br>
then by God I'm going to take all those truck drivers
<br>
behind the hill and put some bullets in some legs---I
<br>
will not kill them.  Because what good would it do anyway?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*              *              *
<br>
<p>Now here are the acid questions:  (1) would you or would
<br>
you not have any moral outrage against the U.S. were the
<br>
Americans to do to enemy captives what is apparently
<br>
being done to theirs?  
<br>
<p>(2) Is there any act of perpetrated by the Iraqis against
<br>
enemy combatants (or enemy nations, e.g., an A-bomb in
<br>
New York's harbor) that would elicit moral outrage on 
<br>
your part?
