<p>Personal blood banks aren't yet practical, except right before surgery.

Blood can only be preserved live for a couple of weeks (at most).  After 
<br>
that it has to be rendered down for plasma and other fractions.  But you 
<br>
might look into joining the Rare Blood Club (I think that's its name).  
<br>
This is an organization of people with rare blood types who donate to 
<br>
help others with rare blood types.  Now you didn't say ABnegative, but I 
<br>
think that it also includes AB.  Still, check it out.
<br>
P.S.:  I also don't know which countries it's active in.
<br>
P.P.S.:  This information may be obsolete.  I first (and last) 
<br>
encountered this organization in Robert Heinlein's &quot;I will fear no 
<br>
evil&quot;. (It's not one of his better books, but if I got the name wrong, 
<br>
you might want to check the original source.)
