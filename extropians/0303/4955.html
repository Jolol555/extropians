<p><em>&gt; ### I think that many of us would agree on a more rigorous division -

<em>&gt; roughly, &quot;violence&quot; non-consensually ends life, or causes severe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-consensual physical suffering. There is a bit of a gray area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding extreme mental suffering but for the most part it is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; major source of misunderstanding. Therefore, money motivating a hitman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is violence, money moving a baker is not.
</em><br>
<p>I wasn't bringing in the issues of consent (or intention or will) because
<br>
I believe the way the mind forms consent is vulnerable to forces just like
<br>
everything else, and of course consenting actions can exert force.
<br>
<p>Does a suicide bomber consent to committing suicide? Does he consent to
<br>
adopting the suicide-bomber-philosophy? Does he consent to being
<br>
coincidentally exposed to the suicide-bomber-philosophy? Does he consent
<br>
to living in circumstances that favor the adoption of the
<br>
suicide-bomber-philosophy? AS you can see, the further you back up the
<br>
analysis, the more &quot;consent&quot; disappears in a cloud of smoke.
<br>
<p>The same goes for economic activities: does a person consent to buying a
<br>
product he chooses to buy? Does he consent to only two products of the
<br>
sort he wants being available? Does he consent to only one product being
<br>
sold practically near to him? Does he consent to receiving marketing
<br>
influences? Does he consent to acquiring the characteristics that make the
<br>
marketing effective? Does he consent to being born with that
<br>
characteristic?
<br>
<p>In other words, I think &quot;free will&quot; should enter the analysis only as what
<br>
it is, a kind of mental construct to deal with the fact that human beings
<br>
cannot quickly (in realtime) analyze all the forces operating upon them
<br>
and all the inner processes and external processes affecting the ongoing
<br>
exercise of their personality. The mind's self-mental model is crude, and 
<br>
contains this &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; conceit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Paying someone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manufacture a product is parallel to paying someone to murder a person -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just different results of the exercise of force.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I do not understand.
</em><br>
<p>Both are economic activities, or can be analyzed that way. There are
<br>
markets for hits, and markets for clothes hangers, pricing considerations,
<br>
advertising potential, etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### The construction &quot;to make somebody do something&quot; usually implies the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use a threat of violence. A thug threating you with a beating if you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not buy a worthless trinket from him, may be threatened with violence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by reciprocity. Sometimes, however, this expression is used differently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - e.g. if a shopkeeper will sell item A only in association with item B,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many people will say he &quot;made&quot; them buy it. In this second, sloppy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning, there is of course no violence or a threat of violence, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accordingly, the buyer's reaction may not include such measures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (including the use of state-organized violence).
</em><br>
<p>I still don't think you've defined &quot;violence&quot; rigorously. If you buy
<br>
something because youneed it to live, or crave it helplessly, or require
<br>
it for any minimal comfort, and because the person you are buying it from
<br>
is the only person you can (for whatever reason) buy it from in the
<br>
circumstances in which you need it, then I can analyze any of the
<br>
scenarios as a play of forces, without aesthetically judging whether it is
<br>
violent or not. If you exercise a perfectly calculated marketing plan on
<br>
the appropriate audience, you can &quot;make&quot; them buy it as if you had
<br>
programmed a robot - without any thugs, baseball bats, or so on.
