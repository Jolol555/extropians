</em><br>
<p>I don't know how to quantify Mr. Drexler's contribution to advance
<br>
'extropy', but I question your or anyone's ability to fully calculate the
<br>
value of any human life, its meaningfulness, its contribution to the
<br>
happiness of others, its inherent richness and enjoyability. For all you
<br>
know, one of those &quot;Iraqi laborers&quot; may be the one who will invent the
<br>
medicines that will save your life someday. Ditto could be said for the
<br>
children with their brains blown out...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Saddam, according to a recent PBS special I viewed in the U.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is estimated to be responsible for ~190,000 deaths (separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from war losses).  Assuming a regime of ~30 years that works
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out to ~6000+ deaths per year.  Saddam was born in 1937, making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him 66, assuming he may have a life expectancy of another 10 years,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that means he will be responsible for the deaths of another 60,000
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  Of course if he passes his regime onto one of his sons,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then we could envision this death toll as going on indefinitely.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think it's very controversial to say that the U.S. stats on
<br>
Saddam's kills are questionable. But it stands to reason that the rate of
<br>
killings would vary with the amount of opposition to his regime, or the
<br>
perception of threat to the regime. The more he tightened power, and
<br>
became more confident, the fewer the killings, possibly. And this does not
<br>
calculate the quality of life for those who survive.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will the death toll of the current war rise above 60,000?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know.  Its clear that many Iraqis are caught between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rock and a hard place (go out and get killed or we will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kill your children, your wife, and then you).
</em><br>
<p>You're also making the assumption that all Iraqis are equally in danger
<br>
from Saddam's regime. But in reality there is probably a big
<br>
variation. Those who are in politically responsible conditions might be in
<br>
greater danger, while those who 'keep a low profile' might have been able
<br>
to successfully survive all these many years of Saddam's regime. For them,
<br>
the introduction of random variables like U.S. bombing and invasion
<br>
increase their odds of injury &amp; suffering &amp; dying.
<br>
<p>And anyway, if you are doing a cost/benefit analysis - wouldn't the Iraqis
<br>
need to be the ones to make the final conclusion? It's their cost, their
<br>
benefit you're analyzing. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, getting onto Extropian Principle #7 &quot;Rational Thinking&quot;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is entirely irrational for the U.S. or the UK or Australia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be sacrificing even a single life to save the life of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqi (assuming that the individuals in these countries have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a better education, better earning capabilities, etc. than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals in Iraq.)  The only argument that makes any sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that we are trying to uplift these individuals -- and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are willing to sacrifice ourselves in order to do so.
</em><br>
<p>...And that seems to be one motivation of soldiers I have seen
<br>
interviewed, if by &quot;uplift&quot; you mean forced to accept rule by a different
<br>
(as yet undescribed) regime.
<br>
<p>But there are others I have heard - doing their job (making money, and 
<br>
pursuing &quot;career goals&quot;, even at risk of life), protecting their friends
<br>
(who are risking their lives to make money &amp; pursue &quot;career goals&quot;),
<br>
etc. Many of the soldiers took the risk of injury and suffering and death
<br>
in order to have the &quot;better education&quot;, &quot;better earning capabilities&quot;,
<br>
etc. promised them by military recruitment marketing. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;We&quot; didn't decide to go to war - only the key decision-makers in the Bush
<br>
administration, ending with Bush, did. Those who voted for the Bush
<br>
administration and who voted for members of congress who gave it the
<br>
&quot;blank check&quot; may be considered indirectly responsible. The rest of the
<br>
U.S. did not necessarily decide to go to war in any fashion, as having no
<br>
role in the decision.
