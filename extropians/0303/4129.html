From: Eliezer S. Yudkowsky [mailto:<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20who%20cares%20if%20humanity%20is%20doomed?">sentience@pobox.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; I finally did work out the theory that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describes what it is going from point A to point B when a moral  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human builds a moral AI, and it turns out that if you build an AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you don't know exactly what the hell you're doing, you die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Period.  No exceptions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you have any ideas for dealing with this besides building 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FAI first? Because as far as I can tell, humanity is in serious,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious trouble.
</em><br>
<p>What exactly do you mean by humanity?  Do you mean the individual
<br>
humans?  If so, none of them are counting on living forever, and
<br>
frankly the odds are that the vast vast majority of them will die in
<br>
the next several decades.
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to be callous here.  I care about people, even those I
<br>
haven't met, and I do my small bit to help eliminate needless death.
<br>
But individuals die.  They always have and they always will.
<br>
<p>Alternately, when you said &quot;humanity&quot; did you mean the human species?
<br>
If so, should we care?  I care about individuals.  If those
<br>
individuals are AIs or post-humans or such, is that any worse than if
<br>
those individuals are humans?  I don't see why.  But maybe I'm unusual
<br>
in having more sentience-loyalty than species-loyalty.
<br>
<p>Let me put it another way.  Go back and put yourself in the position
<br>
of a primate ancestor of ours, maybe 5 million years ago.  Someone
<br>
magically gives you intelligence for a day or so, and gives you a tour
<br>
of the future.  He shows you these things called &quot;humans&quot; that are
<br>
smarter than you are, have richer social interactions, create this
<br>
amazing art and technology, unravel the secrets of the universe,
<br>
etc...  He also shows you how the range of habitats for primates
<br>
shrinks in the human era, how humans use primates for medical
<br>
research, and so on.  Then he gives you the choice.  Should humanity
<br>
be allowed to come into being or not?
<br>
<p>I would choose yes.  Today, I would rather see creatures with more
<br>
intelligence, awareness, creativity, passion, and curiosity than
<br>
humans come into being.  I don't want to do so in a way that hurts
<br>
people, but I know that evolution goes hand in hand with strife.
<br>
Given the choice between humanity continuing in its current form for
<br>
millennia vs. humanity succumbing to a post-human type of life, I'd
<br>
choose the latter.
