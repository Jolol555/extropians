<p>
Harvey, thanks for your lengthy and encouraging reply. I had hoped for
<br>
something along those lines, but wasn't necessarily expecting it.
<br>
<p>Wow! So you've had (more or less) controlled access to this &quot;alternate
<br>
reality&quot; since you were four years old huh? What is the frequency of your
<br>
lucid dreams now then?
<br>
<p>I've had maybe four or five in my entire life in which, for whatever reason,
<br>
I realized that I was dreaming and so I could proceed to explore or assert
<br>
my wishes with abandon. It has been many years since the last time, but I
<br>
still recall that it was a highly empowering, emotionally satisfying
<br>
experience.
<br>
<p>I remember reading somewhere that Osama Bin Laden and his cronies placed an
<br>
unusually high value on the interpretation of dreams and I think at the time
<br>
I said something to myself along the lines of: Wow, how incredibly stupid.
<br>
<p>I had assumed that his interest was centered on the metaphysical, signs from
<br>
Allah angle, but now I wonder if something else wasn't going on there as
<br>
well.
<br>
<p>For example, say if in a series of lucid dreams - and this gets back to what
<br>
you said about doing useful work while dreaming - one were to repeatedly
<br>
practice, in the absence of usual crippling fear, smashing a fuel laden
<br>
airliner into a building. And every time, just as the fireball slaps you in
<br>
the face, you wake up safe and sound in your own bed. I'd guess that after a
<br>
few practice runs of this nature, you'd become fairly confident you had &quot;the
<br>
right stuff&quot; to get the job done in the real world. Essentially, you'd know
<br>
from past experience that you wouldn't be one to veer off at the last
<br>
possible moment and make a bee-line for tea and scrumpets with Saddam or
<br>
Moammar Quadaffi.
<br>
<p>Just something to think about I guess. I'm reasonably certain I'd make a
<br>
lousy Kamikaze pilot. I don't buy lottery tickets, and my seventy-two
<br>
virgins would probably be butt ugly and have names like Olga or Gert. They'd
<br>
also, no doubt, be opposed to any genetic enhancements that didn't directly
<br>
improve their chances of winning a gold medal in the weightlifting
<br>
competition.
