<p>Unlike my proposal, this one does not depend on the public good being
<br>
information. It could actually be applied to funding any kind of public
<br>
good. For example, suppose the U.S. government turned all of its federal,
<br>
state, and local agencies into private charities, and just had a law
<br>
saying that a certain percentage of income must be donated to approved
<br>
charities. Each person decides on his own how to allocate his money among
<br>
these charities. What would happen? Local governments would be overfunded
<br>
compared to state and federal governments, because each person gets a
<br>
larger personal benefit from giving to their local government even if the
<br>
social benefit is smaller.
<br>
<p>So a similar thing would happen if you apply this to information goods.  
<br>
Information with few users would be overfunded compared to information
<br>
with many users. In the limit, each person gives all of the money under 
<br>
his control to himself for producing information that only he himself 
<br>
uses.
