<p>Amara, while I wouldn't dream of second guessing you on astronomical
<br>
matters, I'd hope you'd defer to people who actually have military
<br>
experience in such matters as defense.
<br>
<p>When one state conquers another, it may be fighting another state, but
<br>
it's goal is not to take over the government. Putting a puppet state in
<br>
place is simply an expedient toward the real goal: obtaining the
<br>
economic assets for one's sphere of influence or outright domestic
<br>
needs. 
<br>
<p>An anarchist territory faced with a governed state agressor is still
<br>
conquerable, it is just that there is no central authority to issue a
<br>
surrender from. The conqueror is only interested in obtaining the
<br>
economic productivity of the territory for its own sphere of influence
<br>
and to expand its own tax base. Since the overriding principle of
<br>
anarchy is self sovereignty, an invader is going to have to pacify the
<br>
entire territory, which may or may not be a difficult job, depending on
<br>
the attitudes of the residents of that territory. 
<br>
<p>If the residents are anti-gun pacifist anarchists, they will get rolled
<br>
over like bowling pins.
<br>
<p>If the residents are pro-gun non-initiation-of-force anarchists, that
<br>
is another story entirely. Conquest will be difficult and messy, but is
<br>
still quite possible provided the conquering state does not feel bound
<br>
by any international standards of behavior (Geneva Conventions) or feel
<br>
vulnerable to media scrutiny (i.e. no free press). Conquest is also
<br>
dependent upon whether the anarchist partisans are able to obtain
<br>
materiel support and shelter from third parties. 
<br>
<p>The Soviet experience in Afghanistan is a good example of such a
<br>
conflict, yet it can be seen from the US experience there a decade
<br>
later that a certain degree of technical superiority, in both equipment
<br>
and training, can largely eliminate any advantage the local anarchists
<br>
may have once had, even when the conqueror is under both media scrutiny
<br>
and feels bound by international standards of behavior.
<br>
<p>Training is a big component that is largely overlooked by anarchist
<br>
theorists in defense. Anarchists are generally very individualist. They
<br>
do what they feel like doing and don't do what they don't feel like
<br>
doing. They are not prone to subjecting themselves to military
<br>
discipline or to enjoying such experience when they do. Anarchists are
<br>
both strategically and tactically weak in that it takes lots of
<br>
consensus building to put together a plan of action, leaders
<br>
(facilitators) are elected, and any change in the plan will be met with
<br>
lots of opposition from individuals with their own opinions.
<br>
<p>Todays modern military unit will find that 90% of its effectiveness is
<br>
entirely due to the cohesiveness that comes from long term and well
<br>
managed training of its members. These are members who have no problem
<br>
subsuming their egos to the dictates of the unelected commander who
<br>
achieves his position based on experience, training, and merit. They
<br>
must subsume their egos for extended periods of time and extended
<br>
amounts of training.
<br>
<p>While much hoopla is made in the media today of the whiz-bang high tech
<br>
weaponry the US has, that weaponry is useless in the hands of those
<br>
improperly trained in its integration into unit tactics. Anarchists buy
<br>
into this, thinking &quot;Gee, any anarchist economy is going to be
<br>
technologically more advanced (despite the examples of Afghanistan and
<br>
Somalia), so all we need are weapons of similar technological level.&quot;
<br>
This is an opinion based on ignorance.
<br>
<p>Some anarchists have taken this to heart. We see in the modern
<br>
anti-globalization movement that groups like the Merry Pranksters have
<br>
established anarchist boot camps to train individuals to be the
<br>
anarchist equivalents of 'A-Team' members. An &quot;A-Team&quot;, in Vietnam era
<br>
parlance, is a small unit of a handful of highly trained soldiers (3-5
<br>
members) who will penetrate an area, develop relationships with the
<br>
locals, and build a local firebase with local help and recruit and
<br>
train several platoons of local militia to man the firebase and patrol
<br>
the local region for enemy activity.
<br>
<p>Such anarchist &quot;A-Teams&quot; are the heart of every anti-globalization
<br>
protest held to date. They are impressive in the numbers of individuals
<br>
they have been able to recruit, and in the vehemence that has been
<br>
built in local recruits. The propaganda they use and disseminate in
<br>
local schools and colleges is of paramount importance, but that is
<br>
another story.
<br>
<p>Such events generally attract sufficient numbers that the many jobs the
<br>
A-Team has planned to make the protest effective can be filled just
<br>
from the fact that a large enough pool has a sufficiently diverse
<br>
degree of interests. The 'consensus meetings' that are put together are
<br>
generally shams. The A-Team members are the facilitators and they
<br>
always have several previously recruited individuals in the audience to
<br>
give the answers and ideas, approval and support they need to fulfill
<br>
the plan already agreed to.
<br>
<p>While the anarchists use a lot of effective tactics, their plans are
<br>
generally very simplistic (move x many people from point a to point b)
<br>
or become so complex that the protest fails and is overwhelmed by
<br>
police. Many times the presence of other A-Teams with their own
<br>
organiztions causes conflict and confusion. While they usually have an
<br>
advantage in numbers and morale, protests usually fall apart because
<br>
protestors, like poorly trained militia or conscripts, crack in the
<br>
face of enemy opposition.
<br>
<p>There is currently no known facilities for advanced unit training of
<br>
entire anarchist groups. These would be the anarchist equivalents of
<br>
the US Army's Fort Erwin facility in California.
<br>
<p>Now, all the anarchist activities I've spoken of so far are entirely
<br>
non-martial in nature. For an anarchist group to build the same unit
<br>
cohesiveness that US Army units have, as actual military units
<br>
defending an anarchist ungoverned territory, the anarchists would need
<br>
a facility of roughly equivalent size and scope. At Fort Erwin,
<br>
multiple units can fight entire mock wars with all their actions under
<br>
the monitoring of training cadre. Battles can be fought over and over
<br>
again, with every tactic, from the unit to the individual soldier,
<br>
cross examined and improvements suggested. It is this sort of
<br>
experience and training that anarchist military units will need to
<br>
fight effectively against an advanced organized state military.
<br>
<p>To date, I have met very few anarchists who are pro-gun. Those who are
<br>
tend to be the very most militant and hard-core types who are the heart
<br>
of the anarchist movement. They are Vietnam vets who served in A-Teams
<br>
and they see the current movement as simply a non-violent prelude to an
<br>
outright socialist revolution.
<br>
<p>The primary problem I see with any anarchist society is that its
<br>
members will tend far more toward the bambi-lover non-violent types
<br>
than the type necessary to put together effective anarchist militia
<br>
units with sufficient training to mount effective defenses against
<br>
state agression.
