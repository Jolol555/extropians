<em>&gt; Either you don't believe what you wrote, or you're an idiot and a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; it won't be long before more protest leaders are rounded up, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arrested on trumped up charges, or framed for any number of crimes 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; be labelled &quot;high-risk&quot; when you go to board a flight - no, we're

</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage. Or let me guess, the gov doesn't harass protest leaders?
</em><br>
<p>Given who some of these protest leaders are, they deserve harassment.
<br>
One of the ones from my local area, who organized several busloads of
<br>
protestors for the DC rally this weekend, is one of the key luddite
<br>
saboteurs in this area, engaged in domestic terrorism against genetic
<br>
engineering and high tech targets.
<br>
<p>Other organizers like leaders of the IWW, a communist labor
<br>
organization, whome I've previously documented as major supporters of
<br>
luddite activism and terrorism, through networking, communications,
<br>
logistics, and underground railroading.
<br>
<p><p>Given that the IWW received much support during the cold war from the
<br>
KGB (as documented in the Venona Files), and that Putin has recently
<br>
reconstituted the previously separated units of the KGB, and that
<br>
Russia is opposed to this war due to its commercial interests in Iraq,
<br>
it is entirely appropriate that the FBI determine if the anti-war
<br>
movement today it receiving support through the old conduits from
<br>
hostile foreign organizations. Support may be coming from Russian oil
<br>
conglomerates which employ retired KGB operatives. If such support is
<br>
in existence, the anti-war movement ceases to be a peaceful
<br>
demonstration of citizen free expression, and instead is an instrument
<br>
of treason and sedition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Funny how the police hide behind their masks, put tape on their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; badges.....oh, and there are undercover cops, CIA, hired thugs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provocateurs - all of whom conceal their identities - and illegally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infiltrate &amp; record information
</em><br>
<p>While it is illegal for the CIA to infiltrate domestic groups, it is
<br>
not illegal for the FBI and domestic police agencies to do so. It is,
<br>
in fact, their jobs.
<br>
<p>As for police agent anonymity: they are doing their jobs, they are
<br>
breaking no laws, and have a right to be secure in their families and
<br>
homes. Criminal and traitorous organizations have a history of
<br>
targeting policemen in their homes for intimidation and elimination.
<br>
Are you incensed that you can no longer engage in such activities?
