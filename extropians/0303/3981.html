<em>&gt; &gt;The idea that inventors inherently deserve reward is the communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;fallacy of the labor theory of value: the totally discredited idea that
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; No.  Inventors do deserve reward for their efforts.  But not unlimited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reward, and in most areas of endeavor not a monopoly.  Of course, this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is conditional upon a meaning for the word &quot;deserve&quot;.  I tend to think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of it as meaning something like &quot;it is in society's best interest to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reward this individual to achieve that worthy goal&quot;,
</em><br>
<p>No effort of any kind &quot;deserves&quot; reward unless someone wanted it.  If
<br>
a craftsman spends ten years of his life to build a perfect widget that
<br>
no one wants to buy, then he has wasted ten years of his life and
<br>
doesn't deserve anything for his efforts.  That's the free market.
<br>
The same applies to invention: if nobody wanted it, the inventor has
<br>
no reason to expect any reward.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;the value of a thing is inherent in its creation.  That's simply not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;true, and policies based on that idea are doomed to failure, as all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;socialist systems have been.  Value is created by /demand/, and so what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not necessarily.  Demand by whom?  If the people who want, or perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need, the item can't pay for it that doesn't make it worthless.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it does exactly that.  A thing is worth precisely what someone is
<br>
willing to pay for it.  That's capitalism 101.  I don't care how
<br>
interesting your gadget is, or how much work you put into it, if you
<br>
can't find even one buyer, then it is worthless by definition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider, e.g, a smallpox vaccine.   Nearly no individual wants it, but 
</em><br>
<p>What?  Surely you can't be serious.  I had a smallpox vaccination in
<br>
1973 for which I paid the doctor a fee; therefore, I wanted it, and it
<br>
was worth that fee.  Pretty simple, really.
<br>
<p>Your other example was about something no one can /afford/ to buy, and
<br>
that's a special case, but still Econ 101: if the price at which the
<br>
seller is willing to sell is higher than the price offered by any buyer,
<br>
then the thing still has the value of the buy offers, even though the
<br>
seller refuses to go through with the deal.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;should be rewarded is the ability to fulfill demand, whether by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;innovation or other means.  Without patents, innovation will still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;rewarded /when it fulfills a demand/, but not otherwise, which is how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;it should be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Demand... that's the kind of argument that causes people to consider 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heroin and tobacco valuable, when by my measure they have a negative value.
</em><br>
<p>Of course heroin and tobacco are valuable.  Your moral prejudices
<br>
have no effect on economic reality.  They may have negative value /to you/,
<br>
and you will therefore not buy them.  But they clearly have value to
<br>
those who do buy them.
