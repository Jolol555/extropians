<em>&gt; In a message dated 3/29/2003 8:37:30 PM Central Standard Time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="mailto:phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu?Subject=RE:%20Nature%20of%20Ideology%20(was%20RE:%20More%20enthusiasm%20than%20news%20in%20Fox's%20coverage%20o...">phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu</a> quotes Lee Corbin: &quot;My other theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that the left
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has inherited a tradition, or aspects of a tradition, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goes all the way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back to Lenin.  In revolutionary Russia, Lenin and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followers labeled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves the Bolsheviks, or &quot;Majority&quot;.  It was a conscious..&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Then he chips in in reply, &quot;Lenin is not part of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memetic history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of most US liberals.  Really, he's not.  This may be hard to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept if you're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone like Dehede who likes to slather &quot;socialist&quot; all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around, but it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true.  There may be some common roots between Lenis and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social democracy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going back to the first people outraged at the condition of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the poor in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 19th century, but that's it.  This &quot;Bolshevik&quot; connection is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a fantasy.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Earlier today one of the list members was discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between the left and the right.  I have observed one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; differences is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the communists and socialists never like to admit their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>That's because the labels &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; are so inadequate.  You are
<br>
trying to force a whole world of political beliefs into a single continuum.
<br>
Everybody who doesn't agree with your side, you try to lump together on the
<br>
other side.  Then you are surprised when they won't admit &quot;they&quot; are all the
<br>
same.
<br>
<p>Animal rights lovers probably won't agree with communism.  Green
<br>
environmentalists probably don't derive ecology rules from Lenin.
<br>
Anti-technology luddites probably don't read Mein Kampf for ideas.  Leftist
<br>
atheists and Gaia worshippers aren't deriving their belief systems from the
<br>
same sources.
<br>
<p>Trying to lump all these leftist groups together into a single philosophy
<br>
would be like trying to lump the religious right, christian conservatives,
<br>
militant islamists, and zionist judaism all into a single label.  They
<br>
certainly won't fit well together, and won't all derive their philosophies
<br>
form the same source.
<br>
<p>Extropians are another group that can't all be easily lumped into &quot;right&quot; or
<br>
&quot;left&quot;.  Imagine trying to lump all of us onto one side or the other.  It
<br>
won't work.  Those labels don't describe Extropians as a whole.  If we all
<br>
can't be lumped together easily, why do you assume &quot;they&quot; all can be?
