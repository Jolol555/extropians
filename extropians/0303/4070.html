<p><em>&gt; Canada is also a special case.  Everyone loves Canadians.

<p>That is the American stereotype.  I also wonder whether French
<br>
Canadians are included there.  In the rest of the world, Canadians
<br>
probably pass as &quot;just like Americans, but civilized&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Currently Americans are a grave danger to all
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think this aspect of the Bali bombing was simply an accident.
<br>
They wanted to kill Americans, but either misjudged their presence
<br>
there or simply mistook Australians for Americans.  Most people who
<br>
learn English as a foreign language can't trace English accents to
<br>
the country of origin.
<br>
<p>Americans as a target of terrorism isn't a particularly new phenomenon,
<br>
though.
<br>
<p>Have I already mentioned the stealth license plates used by the
<br>
American troops in Germany?  They used to have distinctive American
<br>
military license plates on their private cars, but eventually
<br>
somebody seems to have realized that this amounts to painting a
<br>
huge crosshairs on them.
<br>
<p>One day I was driving through Ramstein and started noticing something.
<br>
There were an awful lot of cars with license plates starting with
<br>
HK.  Now, I had no idea whether some nearby community issued these
<br>
(German license plates start with a letter code that identifies the
<br>
issuing county), but I noticed that far too many of these cars were
<br>
of American make, or if of European make still had the lights wired
<br>
up American style, and were occupied by people who just looked like
<br>
Americans.  Something fishy was going on there.
<br>
<p>Eventually, I read in the newspaper that the American forces had
<br>
started issuing stealth license plates that largely look like German
<br>
ones, but with the otherwise unassigned initial codes AD and AF.
<br>
I can add HK to that list.  Also, in place of the little D/EU logo
<br>
they have the NATO one, but that's hard to see from a distance.
<br>
The basic idea had some merit, but the implementation is pretty
<br>
silly.  The big crosshairs is still there.
