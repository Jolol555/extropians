Jeffrey Paul Soreff  to Samantha Atkins:
<br>
<em>&gt;What do you see as the key difference that adding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spirituality/mysticism makes? The impression that I'm getting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is that you are expecting it to add something like a degree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of individual benevolence, above and beyond what is justified
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationally by mutual assistance, alliances, and so on. Is this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what you mean?
</em><br>
<p>in my view:
<br>
<p>- psychological support, connectedness, strength, warmth
<br>
- less rigid: fewer walls and more open with yourself and others
<br>
- more delighted in the mysteries of existence
<br>
- listen better to your own inner voices and dreams
<br>
- listen better to other people
<br>
- long term visions are shared easier
<br>
<p>(you might call it the ecstasy experience without the tablets
<br>
and for durations of longer than 8 hours)
<br>
<p>I define the word &quot;god&quot; in my own way, given that I'm an atheist by
<br>
most people's definition. And in my quasi-Buddhist-Amara's-god-universe-
<br>
perspective, my spiritual world is important to give me support when I
<br>
hit OOPSes on my life-path, as well as other for times of despair when
<br>
I wonder wtf I'm doing. We are each of us alone, you know, no matter
<br>
what people are around us in daily life. (Doubly important to have this
<br>
extra dimension when you really are alone.)
<br>
<p>In my use of spirituality, sometimes those &quot;deities&quot; are inside of you,
<br>
hence, by this path, we arrive at a non-deist spiritual practices
<br>
embracing individuality, compassion, and personal growth that are
<br>
compatible with other aspects of the transhumanist perspective. &quot;You
<br>
are it,&quot; as the Upanishads say, and gods are the personifications of
<br>
the energies that inform life, the same information that builds the
<br>
trees and moves the animals and whips up the ocean waves.
<br>
<p>Some time ago on extropians I quoted some words I read in a Nelson
<br>
Mandela speech, which Samantha told me came from another source,
<br>
which I've forgotten now the name. Whatever the source, I like these
<br>
words alot.
<br>
<p>(I substitute &quot;Universe&quot; wherever the word &quot;God&quot; appears, but please
<br>
substitute whatever is appropriate for your world-view.)
<br>
<p>---begin{quote}
<br>
<p>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate.
<br>
<p>Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure.
<br>
<p>It is our light, not our darkness, that most frightens us.
<br>
<p>We ask ourselves,
<br>
Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented and fabulous?
<br>
<p>Actually, who are you not to be?
<br>
<p>You are a child of God. Your playing small doesn't serve the world.
<br>
<p>There's nothing enlightened about shrinking
<br>
so that other people won't feel insecure around you.
<br>
<p>We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us.
<br>
<p>It's not just in some of us; It's in everyone.
<br>
<p>And as we let our own light shine,
<br>
We unconsciously give other people permission to do the same.
<br>
<p>As we are liberated from our own fear,
<br>
Our presence automatically liberates others.
<br>
<p>Nelson Mandela
<br>
1994 Inaugural Speech
