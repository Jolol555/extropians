</em><br>
<p>But it sounds like you would have to extend this sort of agnosticism to
<br>
even relatively unproblematic moral cases like saving someone's life,
<br>
or relieving pain, or granting the last wish of a dying child?  We don't
<br>
have certain knowledge that any of these things are good to do, but I
<br>
think there would be almost 100% agreement that these are in fact good.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that taking such an extremely skeptical position has
<br>
some of the same problems as solipsism: it can't be refuted, but it's
<br>
not useful in practice.
<br>
<p>I would rather start with the idea that it's good to do good, so to speak,
<br>
and then try to extend that to the question of whether it's good to re-run
<br>
good experiences.  Cutting off the inquiry at the beginning by saying
<br>
that we don't know if anything is good isn't going to help with this part
<br>
of the problem, although it may be a valid perspective in its own way.
<br>
<p>The paper that is the subject of this thread,
<br>
<a href="http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/physics/0302071">http://xxx.lanl.gov/pdf/physics/0302071</a>, discusses some of the issues
<br>
relating to moral action in a multiverse.  I don't agree with most of
<br>
their analysis; in particular, they assume the possibility that &quot;you&quot; are
<br>
exactly one instance in the multiverse and therefore that &quot;your&quot; actions
<br>
affect only &quot;you&quot;, which neglects the inherent multiplicity of each
<br>
individual.  I also think that they have moved too quickly to reasoning
<br>
based on having infinite numbers of copies who take each alternative
<br>
course of action, without recognizing that there are probabilities
<br>
involved and that your decisions can affect those probabilities.
<br>
<p>So I would take a very different approach to this problem, but still I
<br>
think that the general idea of considering ethical issues in the context
<br>
of the multiverse is a valid and interesting question.  And it seems to
<br>
me that focusing on Tegmark's level 1 multiverse provides a particularly
<br>
simple and tractable framework for thinking about multiplicities.
