Van Gogh Birthday marked
<br>
<p>&quot;Thousands of fans flocked to  Amsterdam's Vincent Van
<br>
Gogh Museum on Sunday to celebrate the 150th birthday
<br>
of the troubled Dutch painter.&quot;
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>&quot;Don't forget that little emotions are the great captains of our
<br>
lives.&quot; (Vincent Van Gogh, Arles, 1888).
<br>
<p>&quot;Everything is extraordinarily beautiful here! Everything and
<br>
everywhere the color of the sky is an admirable blue, the sun shines
<br>
like pale sulfur, it is sweet and charming like the combinations of
<br>
blues and yellows in the skies of the Vermeer of Delft.&quot;
<br>
...
<br>
&quot;The subject of painting night scenes or night effects and night
<br>
itself interests me tremendously. Night is more alive and more
<br>
colorful than day.&quot;
<br>
(Vincent Van Gogh writing to his brother Theo in 1888 and 1889)
<br>
<p>[From a small art gallery in Arles, France, devoted to Vincent Van Gogh.
<br>
The place was three floors in a house: memorabalia on the first floor,
<br>
and reproductions of his paintings on the next two floors. Among the
<br>
paintings were quotes of letters by Vincent to his brother, Theo, and
<br>
many of those quotes were translated into English. I learned that
<br>
the owner of that place was one of Theo Van Gogh's grandchildren. She
<br>
was  an older lady (near 80, I think), and we both were so sad that I
<br>
didn't speak French, and she didn't speak English. The quotes above,
<br>
are examples that I wrote down while I was in the art gallery.]
