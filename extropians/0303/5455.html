<p><em>&gt;The key is making the memes thinkable. [etc]
</em><br>
<p>All this is true. However, here's a different and more cynical perspective
<br>
that appeals to me even as it appals me:
<br>
<p>An interesting story in the 19th Year's Best SF ed. Gardner Dozois (2002)
<br>
is `The Real Thing' by Carolyn Ives Gilman. A woman from now goes 25 years
<br>
or so into the future, finds everything branded, copyrighted and
<br>
meme-marketed. A zeitgeist guru offers advice.
<br>
<p>&quot;...there's a nearly insatiable demand for certain kinds of information;
<br>
you can always sell more. Other kinds don't repay the costs of production.
<br>
To oversimplify, it's governed by the Urge Pyramid. At the broad base of
<br>
what people want are the primal urges: fear, sex, hunger, aggression, and
<br>
so on. Only when those are satiated do people want to be stimulated by
<br>
beauty, novelty, sentiment, and the other mid-level urges. And at the tiny
<br>
tip of the pyramid is desire for rational thought; it's the last thing
<br>
people want. Information is nutrition for the brain, same as food. We've
<br>
got to have it, roughly in the proportions of the pyramid.&quot; 
<br>
...
<br>
&quot;A successful meme is one that tweaks its host's urge pyramid, and makes
<br>
him want to pass it on. *True* memes are actually at a competitive
<br>
disadvantage... Because, oddly enough, the world doesn't work in a
<br>
memorable or interesting way.That's why fiction is so much more satisfying
<br>
than truth: it caters to our brains, and what they want. Reality needs to
<br>
be productized in order to be convincing.'
<br>
<p>The woman from now muses:
<br>
<p>&quot;Most of what people could find there [on the Internet] was not information
<br>
at all, but processed information product--Velveeta of the mind--more
<br>
convincing than the real thing.&quot;
<br>
