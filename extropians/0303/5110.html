demonstrations happen?  All spontaneous demonstrations are organized.  The

spontaneous part is people choosing to go along with the organizers (who were

there long before the flash-point was reached.)

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I get around to doing an article or book on oxymorons do you mind

if I use that one -- &quot;All spontaneous demonstrations are organized?&quot;
