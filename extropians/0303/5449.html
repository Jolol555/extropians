<p><em>&gt; &gt; And then there's Sean Hannity of FOX.  He takes the prize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the most offensive....snip...Such rot.
</em><br>
<p>Well, not in my opinion.  (Interesting how we all differ, even
<br>
within one proximate area of the political spectrum.)  The only
<br>
TV conservative I cannot stand is Bill O'Reilly, and for exactly
<br>
the type of incident gts related.  He's seldom as interested in
<br>
an honest exchange as simple name-calling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will run the risk of stating the obvious from a memetic context:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The younger &amp; hungrier Right Wing Talk Zealots do get cranked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up a lot--  their producers and agents want them to stay in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;shock&quot;/controversy/polarization zone.  It gains them market from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controvery's first-order (curiosity/first time listeners)...
</em><br>
<p>I think that you've got your causality backwards.  Those so-called
<br>
zealots truly believe what they are saying, and are *not* pressured
<br>
to take even more extreme views.  They obtain their large audiences
<br>
because what they have to say resonates with those audiences.  The
<br>
market place selected them because of their views---not producers
<br>
and agents taking simple and naive flashy personalities and making
<br>
them spout popular views.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pandering, actually. Like the historical Joe Pyne or the fictional 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [Bug] Jack Barron. It really is more than a bit like the WWF.
</em><br>
<p>No, completely wrong.  I used to listen to Joe Pyne.  He was
<br>
no Michael Savage.  His commentary was to the point, and was
<br>
the only (!) thing expressing conservatism that I had ever
<br>
heard in mass media.  He spoke on one (!) radio station from
<br>
L.A., and he didn't last long.
<br>
<p>Since then the liberals or liberal media has elevated him to
<br>
mythological status.  He never laid it on the line as clearly
<br>
and uncompromisingly as his modern day equivalents (I'm not
<br>
so sure that he was even as talented as they).
<br>
<p>You CANNOT call any of the right-wing (or left-wing) extremists
<br>
so popular on radio or television panderers.  Not, at least,
<br>
when they are honestly expressing their own views.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; fingernails-on-chalkboard scale. I can usually stand about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ten minutes of Hannity, thirty seconds of Michael Savage
</em><br>
<p>I can stand Mr. Savage for nearly two minutes.  Of all of those
<br>
from above, even including Mr. O'Reilly, he's the only one
<br>
whose sincerity I seriously question.  Sometimes he's so far
<br>
from conservative reality---or so it seems to me---so over the
<br>
top in mindless denunciation of the motives of his political
<br>
adversaries, that I think he's *deliberately* exaggerating.
<br>
And the people who call in to agree with him---carefully
<br>
screened in a way that Rush's listeners are not---appear to
<br>
be those whose rage is so out of control, that they cannot
<br>
hear the difference between sense and nonsense.
<br>
<p>gts adds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, shock jocks. 
</em><br>
<p>Really think so?  You mean, like Howard Stern?  I don't really
<br>
have any clue as to the psychology of people who it is claimed
<br>
listen or watch in order to be... thrilled?  ...shocked?
<br>
I think that even in the worst case above, like Michael Savage,
<br>
people tune in to hear their own emotions expressed to a
<br>
national audience.  Now if they were simply after logical
<br>
explication of their conservative views, they'd just listen
<br>
to Rush.
