<p>This Topic in Depth begins with a Web site maintained by Dr. Richard B.
<br>
Gomez of George Mason University called Space Debris (1). The site is
<br>
offered as a slide presentation, which explains what space debris is, where
<br>
it comes from, if it's dangerous, what is known about it, and what can be
<br>
done about it. The very interesting site is perfect for non-experts because
<br>
of its simple descriptions and abundance of graphics. The second site from
<br>
Space.com is an article written by Robert Roy Britt entitled Space Junk: The
<br>
Stuff Left Behind (2). Visitors can read about the number of objects being
<br>
tracked (at the time the article was written), what the total weight of
<br>
these objects is, view a table of the number of various pieces of space junk
<br>
by country, and even find out it if there is a risk of getting hit in the
<br>
head by these objects. The next site, Nature's Tiniest Space Junk (3), is
<br>
offered by NASA's news portal Science@NASA Web site.  The page describes how
<br>
scientists are monitoring tiny dust sized meteoroids that are constantly
<br>
flying around our planet that have the potential to be quite dangerous. For
<br>
those really interested, the site lets people listen to audio files of the
<br>
meteor radar in action. The fourth site on space junk, maintained by the
<br>
Texas Advanced Computing Center, is a Simulation of Orbital Debris Shielding
<br>
Performance at High Impact Velocities (4). The page highlights the work of
<br>
Dr. Eric Fahrenthold, who is simulating orbital debris shielding performance
<br>
at high impact velocities. A basic description of the work is offered along
<br>
with the simulation itself, which shows a piece of space debris striking a
<br>
surface. Next, from NASA's Hazards Assessment Web site, comes the
<br>
Hypervelocity Impact Test Facility: Orbital Debris and Micrometeoroids (5)
<br>
page. Readers can find out more on the problem of space junk, why NASA feels
<br>
its so important to study simulating particle impacts on spacecraft, the
<br>
lightweight shields that are in place on the International Space Station,
<br>
and more. The sixth site is an article that appeared in the Bulletin of the
<br>
Atomic Scientists by Joel Primack called Pelted by Paint, Downed by Debris
<br>
(6). Although there's not a large amount of content on the site, it does
<br>
give some interesting information on a different aspect of the subject. The
<br>
author describes how any missile defense program could be detrimentally
<br>
affected by space debris and suggests the need for space agencies to take
<br>
active steps to prevent its buildup. The National Academies Press offers the
<br>
next site, which is actually an online book on Protecting the Space Station
<br>
from Meteoroids and Orbital Debris (7). Contents include risk management
<br>
strategies for the space station, debris modeling, shielding the station,
<br>
collision warning and avoidance, and more. The last site is from the
<br>
Aerospace Corporation and its Center for Orbital and Reentry Debris Studies
<br>
(8). Visitors will find an introduction to the Center, the basics of space
<br>
debris, what happens during satellite reentry, re-entry data and
<br>
predictions, additional links, and more. [JAB]
