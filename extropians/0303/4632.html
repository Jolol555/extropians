<p>Well, the corporeals will try to convince you that it is so. I suspect that
<br>
there are a large group of brain-in-jar transhumanists (such as myself), who
<br>
don't really grok all this stuff about body augmentation/upgrading, except
<br>
where it is necessary for enhancing cognitive life (as if there is any other
<br>
kind).
<br>
<p>Personally, I find the concept of Body to be far too limiting. In some more
<br>
generic sense, there is me, and there are inputs and ouputs which I can
<br>
access. Being stuck with a body is being stuck with a constant and limited
<br>
set of tools. I'd rather be able to connect to I/O devices as necessary
<br>
(avatar robots in situ, telescopes, nanosensors, assemblers, what have you),
<br>
presumably within the confines of my finances. Hmm, that could conceivably
<br>
suck quite badly; in the future, you could be replacing homeless people with
<br>
bodiless people; a kind of techno-wraith denied access to any interaction
<br>
with the physical world, due to the inability to pay.
