<p>
What is the emotional reaction of those protesting the war
<br>
to American setbacks in the field?
<br>
<p>In the last few days, there have been Coalition losses that
<br>
have made headlines.  Unexpected stratagems performed by the
<br>
Iraqis have resulted in American and U.K. tactical setbacks
<br>
(though not strategic ones so far as I can tell).
<br>
<p>Now what is the truth about the way that this news is internally
<br>
digested by the anti-war activists?  The rational response would
<br>
be that since a Coalition victory is probably inevitable, such
<br>
setbacks only needlessly cost lives and prolong the war.
<br>
<p>However, human beings are seldom so ethereally rational, and
<br>
nature has built into human beings emotions for the express
<br>
purpose of short-circuiting &quot;hyper-rational&quot; responses.
<br>
<p>I conjecture that reports of American setbacks are received 
<br>
with gratification by most war protesters.  After all,
<br>
for those who see George Bush as a greater threat and a 
<br>
greater enemy than Saddam Hussein, such a reaction would
<br>
be practically inevitable.  Wouldn't it?
<br>
<p>I have no doubts that on this forum a few people do achieve
<br>
the desirable state that lies between normal human functioning
<br>
on the one hand  and hyper-rationality on the other, that is,
<br>
the highly desired but seldom achieved intermediate state of
<br>
keeping one's emotions quite subdued in the background and
<br>
allowing oneself to be deeply influenced by rational thinking
<br>
and rational memes---yet at the same time not being dominated
<br>
by hyper-rational or other-worldly detachment.
<br>
<p>Yet even on this list we will find, were they to be honest
<br>
and candid about it, that for many the reports of Coalition
<br>
setbacks create a positive emotional affect.  That the majority
<br>
of those marching in the streets are greatly encouraged, almost
<br>
to the extent of experiencing sensations of relief or joy,
<br>
I have little reason to doubt.
<br>
<p>It was in the Vietnam war, after all, as many Vietnamese
<br>
Communists today readily admit, that a mutual aid exchange
<br>
arose between the American war protesters and the North
<br>
Vietnamese, and the military successes of the latter were
<br>
unabashedly cheered by the former.  Each would rejoice and
<br>
be encouraged by the successes of the other.  I think it
<br>
likely that we are seeing much the same today.
<br>
<p>Because ultimately, our hearts determine the course of our
<br>
logical thinking in most of us to a fully conclusive degree.
<br>
In other words, it usually comes down to whose side you're on!
<br>
<p>I don't really see any difference between American U.S. war
<br>
protesters---after hostilities have actually begun---and
<br>
traitors.  Nor do I see any realistic difference between
<br>
war protesters in other nations---who NEVER protest the
<br>
activities or atrocities committed by governments other
<br>
than the U.S.---and those who are strict, formal, complete,
<br>
and declared enemies of the United States, the United Kingdom,
<br>
and their allies.
<br>
<p>There happens to be a war going on, and you've already taken
<br>
sides, whoever you are, so admit it.  You can't be blamed for
<br>
it.  It's the way we are.
<br>
<p>It was obvious to all after the U.S. and U.K. had over 200,000
<br>
troops in the region, that an invasion was going to occur unless
<br>
there were dramatic developments in Baghdad, e.g., an abdication.
<br>
Therefore, the most logical (or hyper-rational) course for activists
<br>
genuinely wishing war to be avoided would have been to take to the
<br>
streets to protest the Iraqi regime and to call for Saddam Hussein
<br>
to step down.  It's equally obvious how discouraging to Saddam
<br>
Hussein such protests would have been, and how his position
<br>
would have been weakened.
<br>
<p>Instead, of course, his regime was buoyed by the same hopes that
<br>
encouraged and helped the North Vietnamese persevere against the
<br>
U.S. in the Vietnam War.  Today's war protesters, just like their
<br>
antecedents 30 years ago, are doing and will do everything that
<br>
they can possibly think of to encourage Saddam Hussein and to
<br>
cheer for the Iraqi army, decorum permitting.
<br>
<p>Any lengthening of the war will be accompanied by positive
<br>
emotions by those who are against the Coalition, not only
<br>
for the political damage that they calculate accrues to the Bush
<br>
regime, but also because it retards the success of the United
<br>
States, the United Kingdom, and their allies in general, and
<br>
promotes world-wide solidarity among the peoples resisting
<br>
the &quot;imperialism&quot; of those powers.
<br>
<p>Is there a time when you've seen huge flocks of activists
<br>
critical of anything besides American policy?  There are
<br>
NEVER protests, except (directly or indirectly) to object
<br>
to a U.S. policy.  This proves what the agenda is.
<br>
<p>Lee
