<em>&gt; &gt; Now it is billed as &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot; but initially

<em>&gt; &gt; it should have read &quot;Operation Iraqi Liberation&quot;. So, if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take a look at the abbreviation for this fine advertisment, you will

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; O.I.L.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But still it's an interesting point that you make. I wonder if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pentagon/White House decided to avoid the label &quot;Operation Iraqi
</em><br>
Liberation&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; for the reason you suggest. It would after all have been a more poetic and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appropriate name for the operation, but the acronym is embarrassing.
</em><br>
<p>How can I know if I am right? It is just a strange coincidence that turns on
<br>
some light bulb in brain regions that are normally hardly accessible. When a
<br>
non-causal connection like this O.I.L. thing happens, your initial laughter
<br>
becomes stuck in your throat.
<br>
<p>In spite of my anti-war position I do not believe that oil is the single or
<br>
main reason for this war, but it sure has a lot to do with it. Even from my
<br>
point of view it sounds embarassing to yell &quot;No blood for oil!&quot; But some
<br>
smart guy - I forgot his name and nationality - calculated that the Iraqi
<br>
oil reserves might be worth approximately 3000 billion dollars, so even a
<br>
longer war might pay off for the US companies who get access to the oil
<br>
wells, particularly as the old contracts Saddam made, will soon be
<br>
worthless: on the day he is removed.
<br>
<p>Disclaimer: You - the USA - can gladly have the oil. Take half of it , leave
<br>
half of it to the Iraqi people to defend their youg democracy. I don't care.
<br>
I do not want a single drop of it. I do not envy the oil companies. I do not
<br>
envy the strong and victorious USA.You can get richer and richer. I don't
<br>
mind. My protest has no economic base. I am simply mad about the abuse of
<br>
young men and women on both sides in this ill-fated religious crusade.
<br>
<p>In the 13th century armies of religiously inflamed 13 to 16 year old kids
<br>
started the so called children's crusade. They ran away from their homes in
<br>
Germany and France - yes, another funny coincidence - and wanted to liberate
<br>
the Holy Grave in Palestine. They never reached the &quot;Holy Land&quot;. Most of
<br>
them died in the Alpes alraedy or were killed or sold as slaves. I had to
<br>
think about this historical event when 50.000 kids of the same age gathered
<br>
in Berlin to peacefully protest against this contemporary adult Iraq
<br>
crusade.
<br>
<p>As a citizen of Germany I am aware of the devastating belligerent history of
<br>
my country. That's why I felt a bit of satisfaction - no pride though, I
<br>
have NEVER been proud of Germany in my whole life - to see the colorful
<br>
crowd of young people in Berlin. It is hard for a German citizen to
<br>
comprehend the US patriotism and national pride. You will not find it here
<br>
to this extend. It irritates the people here.
