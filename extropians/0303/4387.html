<p>I'm not sure what distinction you're making between value and benefit. And
<br>
just how will it become clear that I experience twice the benefit if I
<br>
have twice the number of copies running in a given volume of spacetime?
<br>
Will I, after running multiple copies of myself, suddenly realize the
<br>
truth of this statement as an epiphany? How can that happen, given that
<br>
having multiple identical copies of oneself has no subjective feel? It
<br>
seems much more likely that after running multiple identical copies of
<br>
myself, I'll say &quot;I don't feel any different. This is pointless. Let's go
<br>
back to running just one copy.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In 1990 or so, I published an article in The Immortalist
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I need to dig that up.
</em><br>
<p>You can claim anything as an axiom, but it's not self-evident to me.
<br>
<p>We know that if you run the same computation twice in a row, it's usually
<br>
faster the second time because some of the necessary data will already be
<br>
in cache. So with the same resources, the number of identical computations
<br>
you can run can be higher than the number of different computations you
<br>
can run.
<br>
<p>With that in mind, consider the following thought experiment. Suppose you
<br>
run a charity, which provides memory and computational power to those who
<br>
can no longer afford enough to sustain their mind. Let's say you currently
<br>
serve 4 people, all of whom are living in seperate closed virtual worlds,
<br>
and because you respect their privacy, you have no idea what's going on
<br>
inside these worlds. Three of them are identical and determinstic (so
<br>
they'll always be identical). Now suppose due to a budget crunch, you can
<br>
only support either 3 identical worlds, or 2 different worlds. Would you
<br>
always choose to terminate the one world that's different? Or if you were
<br>
to receive a budget increase, would you always just make more copies of
<br>
the person you already have, rather than consider new applications?
