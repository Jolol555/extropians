<p>
Last week I posted a comment on the vulnerability of the U.S. (and world)
<br>
economy to increases in the price of oil. A couple of people seemed to
<br>
disagree with this; one person even claimed that the U.S. economy is
<br>
presently &quot;in good shape.&quot;
<br>
<p>I didn't have time to respond last week, and I don't have time for a lengthy
<br>
post today. I'll let David Leonhardt of the NYTimes speak for me.
<br>
<p>Excerpt from today's paper:
<br>
============================
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/business/02ECON.html?th">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/02/business/02ECON.html?th</a>
<br>
<p>Oil Price Jump Adds to Jitters Over Economy
<br>
<p><p>The most common cause of recessions, a surge in oil prices, is again
<br>
afflicting the global economy.
<br>
<p>Just as they have before every American downturn over the last 40 years,
<br>
energy costs have risen significantly in the last year, capped by a sharp
<br>
spike since December.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>&quot;The economy is extremely fragile,&quot; said Mark M. Zandi, the chief economist
<br>
at Economy.com, a research company in West Chester, Pa. &quot;We've got some real
<br>
problems if this drags on for any length of time.&quot;
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>&quot;The single best cyclical indicator for the world economy is the price of
<br>
oil,&quot; said Andrew J. Oswald, an economist at the University of Warwick
<br>
outside Coventry, England. &quot;Nothing moves in the world economy without oil
<br>
in there somewhere.&quot;
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>In 1991, oil prices fell almost as soon as the United States attacked Iraq,
<br>
and many economists think the same could happen this year.
