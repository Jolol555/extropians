<p><em>&gt; Let me just make a few general remarks: I objected to your

</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons. I judge all actions by their long-term outcomes. To reliably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve desired outcomes in interactions involving large numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participants, simple rules and clear-cut definitions are paramount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (although not sufficient). For practical purposes, conflating violence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (as I previously defined it) with non-violent exchanges, in the attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to include all of the world's complexity in the decision-making, leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to discretion, arbitrariness and confusion, rather than improved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes.
</em><br>
<p>I thought you objected to the concept of economic forces altogether. I am
<br>
not sure myself whether I would consider some economic activities
<br>
&quot;violent&quot; - our language tends to depersonalize economic forces, so that
<br>
they cannot, according to that model, themselves commit acts (violent or
<br>
otherwise: we could equally not speak of &quot;benevolent economic
<br>
forces&quot;). 
<br>
<p>Let's take &quot;non-violent&quot; exchanges - is there such a thing as an &quot;unforced
<br>
exchange&quot;? An exchange in which no forces are operating on any of the
<br>
participants to affect the exchange behavior - the decision to exchange,
<br>
the form and manner of the exchange, etc.? I would argue: no. Some of
<br>
those forces can even be volitional - a consciously decided behavior by
<br>
one of the parties. 
<br>
<p>In the contemporary world, we don't need simple definitions and simple
<br>
rules - we need complex definitions and complex rules to cover the
<br>
complexity of the world we can now discern. What we have now are medieval legal
<br>
systems, backed up by judges using folk-models of reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### These are &quot;deception&quot; and &quot;physical threats&quot; - concepts separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from &quot;violence&quot;, although related in being in most cases undesirable.
</em><br>
<p>Well then why don't we include them. Deception is used all the time in
<br>
economics. Physical threats can be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### I disagree here explicitly. For the practical purposes of devising a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal system, simplicity is of the utmost importance. The basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts, like &quot;violence&quot;, must be clearly defined, so that unequivocal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions can be made in most cases, with minimal discretion. Allowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an infinite number of &quot;interacting forces&quot; to enter into the analysis is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; highly counterproductive. Since &quot;economic forces&quot; are not violent, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal apparatus designed to deal with violence (criminal law) should not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be used in the areas best left to civil law, non-violent interactions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between people.
</em><br>
<p>People have blindly, gropingly constructed legal systems that regulate the
<br>
economy because of their grasp that unfairness and unfortunate states
<br>
of affairs can be caused and perpetuated by economic forces. Thus we have
<br>
industry regulations, protections of competition, laws of commerce,
<br>
etc. If the economy were utterly innocuous, none of these would be
<br>
necessary. You may argue that they are not necessary, but my view at the 
<br>
moment is that these rules are, in general, a good idea, but that they
<br>
need to be improved and increased in complexity to match the complexity of
<br>
the analysis we can make of the entire economy and how it is embedded in
<br>
all other factors that influence the circumstances of human beings.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Again, for the sake of practical workability, only the final
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outcomes of cognitive acts can usefully be subject matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinctions between consensual and non-consensual acts (aside from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct neural control), since only this focus allows appropriate, simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules for behavior modification. The history of being exposed to some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nebulous forces, purportedly removing one's ability to make independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions, cannot be used in a workable legal system as an extenuating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstance.
</em><br>
<p>If behavior modification were easy and simple, it would already be being
<br>
done, and there would be no suicide bombers. My goal is not for
<br>
one human party to develop omnipotent ability to affect others' behavior-
<br>
a sad, reduced state of affairs IMO. My goal would be for all human beings
<br>
to come into greater power over all the factors that are influencing
<br>
them. Working from an unanalyzed model of choice or consent that
<br>
conceptualizes a perfectly free inner &quot;chooser&quot; that is insulated from
<br>
being formed or affected by external factors does NOT IMO help us to
<br>
acquire this power. Because it is not realistic, in the fine degree of
<br>
precision - it does include all the relevant factors.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ### You made a decision not to seek more enlightenment. You are not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide bomber by your own will.
</em><br>
<p>Think about this a minute - how is he supposed to know there is more
<br>
&quot;enlightenment&quot; somewhere else? How is he supposed to access it? How does
<br>
he extricate himself from the influence of the memes of a philosophy
<br>
which he has acquired that explicitly leads him NOT to seek other
<br>
philosophies or trust them? How does he compensate for the factors that
<br>
may make his present philosophy seem more appealing than the
<br>
&quot;enlightenment&quot;? Does he have the IQ or imagination or learning to
<br>
even grasp &quot;enlightenment&quot; philosophy if he were exposed to it? That is,
<br>
would the enlightenment meme have any tools to enter and anchor in his
<br>
mind in full symbiosis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Explain. You mean I get to determine every company's product line?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Yes, partially.
</em><br>
<p>I don't remember being consulted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Allowing the claim that &quot;Twinkies made me do it&quot; would lead to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undesirable social outcomes, so it must be rejected. 
</em><br>
<p>If twinkies *could* make people do things, how could people be empowered
<br>
by denying that reality and fact?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### With the exception of billboards, you do. Remember, you don't need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see the ads or even watch TV.
</em><br>
<p>You're right - I don't need to see the ads. Sometimes I might need to
<br>
watch TV, say, to get crucial emergency information. But why is this just
<br>
about needs? Why can't I choose to drive along the familiar highways of my
<br>
neighborhood without seeing billboards, or even particular billboards? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Some people do not. Can you plausibly call a chocolate vendor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;violent&quot; for catering to this taste?
</em><br>
<p>The chocolate vendor is exercising a force that leads susceptible
<br>
individuals to purchase the chocolate - where the force meets its
<br>
appropriate context, the result is automatic, the purchase happens. If the
<br>
susceptibility were strong and widespread, and the effect of eating the
<br>
chocolate were considered undesirable by people, those people would be
<br>
very upset about the chocolate vending.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Ethics is a branch of aesthetics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### ? According to all the dictionaries I consulted, these are separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; domains of inquiry.
</em><br>
<p>Aesthetics deals with judgments of value and desirability etc. Ethics
<br>
applies these to human behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But - using violence to prevent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; violence? is an oxymoron. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Not an oxymoron - reciprocity.
</em><br>
<p>If violence is deployed, violence is not prevented. It is an oxymoron.
