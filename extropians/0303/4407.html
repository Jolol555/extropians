<p>
I read something the other day that got me thinking about what the world
<br>
would be like if everyone were honest.  By honest I mean mostly that when
<br>
they give their word, they feel bound to keep it.  It would also mean that
<br>
people would tell the truth and not lie.  To some extent the situation
<br>
in Wright's The Golden Age had some properties like this: although people
<br>
could lie, they had the ability to tell the truth in a verifiable way, by
<br>
letting the machines read their mind.  And as it was a pure libertarian
<br>
world, everyone seemed to feel very much bound by contracts that they
<br>
had agreed to.  I think maybe the machines enforced that.
<br>
<p>You also get some of the effects of the worlds depicted in Brin's
<br>
Transparent Society, and Halperin's The Truth Machine.  You could ask
<br>
someone if they had committed a crime, and they would either tell the
<br>
truth or stay silent.  Or you could require people to agree to try to
<br>
obey the laws, perhaps as a condition for free access in society, and
<br>
then if they agreed, they would have to do it.  Crime levels would be
<br>
much lower than in our world.
<br>
<p>The article I read discussed the situation with regard to Digital
<br>
Rights Management (DRM).  If people were bound by their promises, then
<br>
they could be required to agree to restrictions as a condition for
<br>
receiving information.  The result is that you get the effects of DRM
<br>
in the all-honest world, even without any special technology.  It just
<br>
happens automatically.
<br>
<p>The surprising thing is that in many ways, the all-honest world feels very
<br>
restrictive and limiting.  In fact, it is almost downright totalitarian.
<br>
The one saving grace would be that society wouldn't necessarily have to
<br>
adopt easy solutions like requiring people to promise to obey the law
<br>
or to respond when asked if they had committed a crime.  Society could
<br>
take the position that no one had to testify against himself, and give
<br>
people more protection.  In effect, in an all-honest world people have
<br>
less inherent personal freedom, so society might compensate by creating
<br>
policies that encourage public freedom.
<br>
<p>In the future, it might be possible for people to convincingly commit
<br>
to behaving honestly.  They could have their mental program reviewed by
<br>
some AI which would certify that they were honest.  I wonder if doing
<br>
so would be a net advantage or disadvantage?  On the one hand, an honest
<br>
person would be a fine partner or associate, one who could be completely
<br>
trusted and who would never cheat.  This would suggest that honesty is a
<br>
good policy.  But on the other hand, by giving up the option of cheating,
<br>
the honest man may not be able to take advantage of certain potentially
<br>
lucrative opportunities that may arise.  His unwavering commitment to
<br>
honesty might impose so many limits that the policy is a net loss.
<br>
<p>Of course we face the same choice and dilemma in our world, but
<br>
we have a big problem: we can't verifiably commit to being honest.
<br>
You can never tell if a person is really honest or is just pretending.
<br>
In this hypothetical future, an honest person will gain the ability to
<br>
prove it, which should greatly increase the value of honesty.  In fact,
<br>
over time, social pressure might arise for people to commit to these
<br>
policies of honesty.  The world would be divided into Knights, who
<br>
could be trusted, and Knaves, untrustworthy rogues who played by their
<br>
own rules.  The dramatic possibilities alone are enormous.
<br>
<p>In some ways, Palladium-style &quot;trusted computing&quot; technology provides a
<br>
preview of such a world, in a small domain.  It lets you convincingly
<br>
prove to a remote system that you are running a particular program,
<br>
which means that your computer's behavior is trustworthy from the remote
<br>
point of view.  That's why you may be eventually forced to run Palladium
<br>
systems in order to legally download movies and music, because only
<br>
this kind of public commitment to &quot;honest&quot; or &quot;trustworthy&quot; behavior
<br>
will win the confidence of the content companies.
<br>
<p>Will it be good or bad?  Is honesty really the best policy?  I hope
<br>
and expect that we will learn much more about these issues over the
<br>
next few years as we gain experience with these technologies.
<br>
