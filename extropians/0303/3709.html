What really needs to be stopped is the very idea, any legitimacy 
<br>
granted at all to the idea that it is a reasonable function of 
<br>
government, within the purview of government to wield any such 
<br>
broad powers.  As long as it is excepted as legitimate there 
<br>
will always be the danger of such irresponsible massive blows. 
<br>
Do not give as fickle and dangerous a Beast as government this 
<br>
kind of power.  Chain it and quickly.   How?  There's the rub.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; astonishment that some very well meaning and intelligent people actually
