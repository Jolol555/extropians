<p>Yes I would go with a gnutella client if I were forced to use P2P (the
<br>
cleanest I've seen is called Swapper.NET) but my concern is not so much with
<br>
the spyware embedded in the file sharing apps themselves... My main concern
<br>
is the high percentage of infected files on the P2P networks and the
<br>
security risks involved in opening up one's machine to those networks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After picking up the right program, the usual rule of never

</em><br>
<p>Sure, but as I understand it, (correct me if I'm wrong), file and printer
<br>
sharing must be enabled to run any kind of P2P client, including gnutella
<br>
clients. That alone presents a security risk, even if you never swap a
<br>
single file. Those of us running stand-alone computers have no need for file
<br>
and printer sharing, so the risk is entirely unnecessary.
<br>
<p>If I were really into file sharing then I would set up a dedicated machine
<br>
for that purpose. Any cheap second-hand computer from the classified section
<br>
of the newspaper would perform just fine. Cheap insurance.
