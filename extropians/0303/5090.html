I'm sorry.  I thought I was answering him.  My answer was, that I don't 
<br>
have any feeling of joy about the setbacks.  Or, really, any sorrow.  I 
<br>
don't know any of the people involved, so my emotions don't flow at that 
<br>
level, but are rather moved by more abstract criteria.  I'm not claiming 
<br>
to represent any large fraction of protestors, but merely myself.  I 
<br>
have protested, so I qualify as one of the people he was asking about.
<br>
<p>I tend, in my eyes, to be basically an isolationist libertarian.  I 
<br>
don't believe in starting aggression, it seems wrong to me.  But I also 
<br>
don't rejoice when someone I disagree with meets with problems (and I 
<br>
doubt that the resistance being encountered is sufficient to raise to 
<br>
that level).   I don't feel that we have some right to be the world's 
<br>
policeman, and it seems to me that insisting that Iraq disarm when they 
<br>
have many nearby enemies is ... bizarre.  I will grant you that they 
<br>
created their current enemies (except in the case of Turkey, where it 
<br>
seems more motivated by desire to prevent an independant Kurdish 
<br>
state).  But still...  to place it in a different context, I see it as if:
<br>
A man has been terrorizing a group in an alley with a knife.  You walk 
<br>
up to him, point a gun and say &quot;Throw down your knife, and I'll walk 
<br>
away&quot;.  If he does what you say, how long will he live?  Yes, he created 
<br>
the mess, but still...
<br>
<p>In a sense it could be argued that we have an obligation to remove 
<br>
Hussein, because we saddled Iraq with him in the first place, so if we 
<br>
had placed a price on his head I wouldn't have a qualm, but most of the 
<br>
people being killed and maimed are essentially innocent.  And the 
<br>
justifications for starting the war seem very shallow.  How many 
<br>
countries do you suppose feel threatened that they US has weapons of 
<br>
mass destruction?  And of that number, are there not some few who might 
<br>
feel that we could attack them?  Are they then justified in attacking us?
<br>
<p>We jail a larger fraction of our population than most countries, the 
<br>
conditions under which we hold them are vile, and some of them are 
<br>
killed.  Most countries consider that an apalling mistreatment of our 
<br>
citizens, and I wouldn't want to try to justify it.  Would this make it 
<br>
right for them to invade us?
<br>
<p>Saying that other countries are no better is really faint praise, and 
<br>
I'm not even sure it's true.  It used to be, but that's not the same thing.
<br>
<p>I hope that I have answered what you wanted answered.  If not, then I 
<br>
don't understant your question.  (Also, I'm not really clear about the 
<br>
connection between this question and extropianism.  Other doctrines I 
<br>
can see as applying, but if I missed answering that, it's because I 
<br>
really don't understand.)
