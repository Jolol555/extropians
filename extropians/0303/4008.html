<p>
What's up for this week? Christopher Reeve -- an influential and wealthy
<br>
advocate for medical research in the past -- has been speaking out recently
<br>
against government legislation to criminalize research. He has spoken out
<br>
against the bioethics council. In short, he is absolutely in our team, on
<br>
our side of the field -- and probably one of the best-positioned people to
<br>
actually make a difference.
<br>
<p>Have a look at this article:
<br>
<p><a href="http://sci.newsfactor.com/perl/story/20893.html">http://sci.newsfactor.com/perl/story/20893.html</a>
<br>
<p>and position statements:

<p>and more explanations on theraputic cloning:

<p>What can we do to help? Well, we can encourage him for one. Tell him we're
<br>
rooting for him; let him know that large numbers of people support his
<br>
statements and stance. I urge you to read the article, and compose a short
<br>
note to submit here:

<br>
<p>Ideal notes congratulate Christopher Reeve and his staff on their
<br>
increasingly vocal support for stem cell research and let him know that we
<br>
support his position (and wish we could have as much influence,
<br>
damnit...well ok, maybe not that last part). Here's a sample (BUT DON'T CUT
<br>
AND PASTE! WRITE YOUR OWN!)
<br>
<p>--------
<br>
<p>Dear Sirs,
<br>
<p>We were most impressed with Christopher Reeve's recent statements at the MIT
<br>
and Harvard Hippocratic Societies' joint 2003 Conference on Neuroscience. It
<br>
is very gratifying to see an advocate of his influence speaking out against
<br>
the dangerous, cruel legislation and positions of the current US
<br>
administration and the President's Council on Bioethics. There a great many
<br>
people who share your views, but not your ability to speak and be heard, in
<br>
the wider community. Everyone's future health will be hurt -- and hurt
<br>
badly -- by future anti-research, anti-science legislation in medicine. More
<br>
needs to be done to combat this trend.
<br>
<p>We salute you for taking this stance and speaking up: please continue to do
<br>
so.

<br>
<p>As a last note, if anyone knows any journalists or influential bloggers,
<br>
this story needs wider exposure. Prod them, point them in the direction,
<br>
point out the excellent newsworthiness of this article -- ex-superman star,
<br>
criticizing government, stem cells, the works! A bunch of hot topics all
<br>
rolled into one. See if we can get this picked up further afield.
