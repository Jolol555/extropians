<em>&gt; Mike, I wont get into the political side of this in detail. All I will ask
</em><br>
is does the forwarding of this list
<br>
<em>&gt; increase extropy?  I would imagine your answer may depend on your
</em><br>
political view of the French actions. This is
<br>
<em>&gt; the point that interests me, how one person may see an action or subject
</em><br>
as extropic. Where another may not. 
<br>
<em>&gt; I am trying to get to the bottom of what 'Extropic&quot; really means and how
</em><br>
its interpretation can be skewed by other
<br>
<em>&gt; factors. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alex 
</em><br>
<p>It seems clear to me that Extropic is definitely in the eye of the beholder.
<br>
This is an individualist philosophy that we are refering to; the
<br>
interpretation of individuals must be paramount. Post-modernists might
<br>
mutter something under their breaths about &quot;multiplicity of discourse&quot;; I'd
<br>
simply say that each person is free to interpret Extropianism as he/she sees
<br>
fit.
<br>
<p>Of course, that doesn't stop that anyone from being a stupid plonker (in the
<br>
eyes of other individuals). But extropy is not the negative of the
<br>
thermodynamic concept of entropy, and thus universal; it is a personal
<br>
philosophy. While I may think that extropians should interpret the
<br>
principles in a particular way, and you may think the same thing (although
<br>
our particular definitions of extropy may differ), that doesn't make it so
<br>
for anyone else.
<br>
<p>There is a unifying factor, which is rationality; it's in the principles.
<br>
Might I humbly propose that we all take a few minutes to have a look at the
<br>
principles today, read them and think about them just for a few minutes, and
<br>
reflect on their relationship to our own recent posts? Leave aside
<br>
consideration of other people's posts, no matter how vile you might consider
<br>
them; just consider your own recent posting, in the light of the principles,
<br>
and your own, hopefully somewhat internally consistent, interpretation of
<br>
their meaning.
<br>
<p>For my part, I don't think that I can usefully post anything related to the
<br>
current war for quite a while. Somehow all discussions turn to irrational
<br>
crap, and end up being far worse than useless (imo). I know it's an
<br>
important issue, I really do, and I feel really strongly about it. But, as
<br>
objectively as I can, I have determined that there is just no point to
<br>
further postings in regard of it, at least for the time being.
<br>
