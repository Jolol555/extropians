From: Robert J. Bradbury [mailto:<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=RE:%20Extropic%20Priorities">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; Thus the U.S. could eliminate the entire population of Iraq 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (~24 million people, a one time event) and still be causing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significantly less &quot;extropic&quot; damage than excess caloric 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption is doing (*each* year).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, *why* the blazes is the ExI list debating IRAQ when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it should be debating caloric intake?  
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for a thought-provoking question, Robert.  As Lee Corbin
<br>
posted, thinking about Iraq and about obesity are not mutually
<br>
exclusive.
<br>
<p>That having been said:  The US invasion of Iraq is being driven by a
<br>
very small number of actors.  If you could change the minds of just a
<br>
handful of people, it wouldn't happen.  In contrast, obesity is driven
<br>
by decisions distributed across billions of individuals.  Those
<br>
decisions are themselves driven by biologically influenced behaviors
<br>
that have evolved over 10s of millions of years, if not longer (stock
<br>
up on calories, you never know when you'll need them!).
<br>
<p>As a result, the invasion of Iraq is easier to get one's head around.
<br>
You can point to a clear lever point that could prevent it, if only
<br>
you could somehow influence that point.
<br>
<p>Personally I feel that the most realistic way to counter wide spread
<br>
detrimental decision making (like consuming too many calories) is to
<br>
modify ourselves and our offspring to remove or reduce some of the
<br>
biological urges that were adaptive in prehistoric times but are now
<br>
harming us.
