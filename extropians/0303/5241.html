<p>I'm not going to defend FOX News--it *is* often deeply goofy-cartoony. But 
<br>
I do want to point out that during my only spate of channel-surfing of 
<br>
late, they appeared to me to be the ones that broke the fragging story and 
<br>
several detail followups, ahead of CNN and several other cable/sat 
<br>
newsfeeds. In my view, not exactly only-support-our-side-rah-rah-rah, and 
<br>
not especially lightweight reporting. The print tabloids are for idiots, 
<br>
too, but every once in a while they actually break real news. Just don't 
<br>
swallow stuff whole, and get plenty of fresh air. CNN might *seem* like 
<br>
fresh air by comparison.
<br>
<p>I think *all* TV war reporting, and indeed the overall reporting posture, 
<br>
war or not, of all the networks sucks. I think the gimme-gimme-gimme 
<br>
stimulus/spectacle-audience loop today is in several ways discourse- 
<br>
damaging-verging-on-pathological--no matter if the diffusion is by CNN, 
<br>
FOX, or al-Jazeera. But then, war is damaging and pathological in several 
<br>
ways, too.
<br>
<p>If the audience were classier, the media would have to respond by being 
<br>
classier. But good ol' news-as-junk-food (LIVE FEED WITH NOTHING HAPPENING) 
<br>
sells. In a world where MTV and WWF are commercial successes, a news near- 
<br>
analog of either is big bucks waiting to be scooped up.
