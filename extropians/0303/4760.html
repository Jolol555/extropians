<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I came to many of the same conclusions as Mike and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alex independently, after pondering the question for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some time.  Communism doesn't work well unless the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole planet is communist.  If one capitalist society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists next to a communist, it prospers like crazy;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the go-getters in the commie society want to escape
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live with the rich capitalists.  Examples North
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and South Korea, East and West Berlin.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly, it seems to me that a libertarian society
</em><br>
<em>&gt; next to a totalitarian society is at a military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disadvantage, altho at a great advantage in every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other sense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would suggest a mostly libertarian society that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allows great personal and financial freedom but still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reserves the right to raise taxes for common defense,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and even the right to draft citizens in a dire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emergency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spike
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, hang on a second there. Socialist countries do badly compared to
<br>
capitalist countries in a capitalist global system (as the 20th century
<br>
socialists discovered to their chagrin). Socialists might fare better in a
<br>
socialist world system (say a socialist world government, perhaps? Something
<br>
like the EU on steroids maybe :-). However, isolated capitalist countries
<br>
within a socialist world system might not fare so well.
<br>
<p>As to a libertarian pseudo-state in a capitalist world system, you might try
<br>
Vinge's &quot;The Ungoverned&quot; (from &quot;The Collected Stories of Vernor Vinge&quot;), for
<br>
a somewhat idealistic but interesting investigation of the possibilities.
<br>
Any libertarian who hasn't read this story really should; you'll really
<br>
enjoy it.
