Why are you putting such emphasis on that?  Would it be                       
<br>
all right if she had been a Palestinian (supposedly)                          
<br>
engaged only in peaceful demonstration?                                       
<br>
<p><p>The US government has no specific obligation to protect either Israelis or
<br>
Palestinians. Since the US government is funded and elected by US citizens
<br>
it does have an obligation to US citizens. Later in your post you point out
<br>
pretty much the same thing.
<br>
<p>I really don't know the specifics of why those houses were being torn
<br>
down. Who knows, maybe they were houses-of-evil or houses-of-mass-destruction
<br>
or something. Maybe they violated some kind of city-beautification
<br>
ordnance. Maybe the Palestinians were right or maybe the Israelis were,
<br>
I'm betting it's neither. That's a whole different can of worms, and must
<br>
not distract from the fact that the Israelis crossed the line into killing
<br>
citizens of third-party nations. Not the first time, either, though possibly
<br>
the first time that it's an American. Anybody know?
<br>
<p>Yes, I know that Islamic terrorists are quite up-front about killing
<br>
Americans. That's why we're getting set to kick their asses wherever we see
<br>
them or imagine we see them. But Israel is supposed to be our buddy, isn't it?
<br>
<p><p>Wanna bet?  I give odds of 2 to 1 against.
<br>
<p><p>Those odds sound about right.
