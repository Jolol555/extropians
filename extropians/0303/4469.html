<em>&gt; Wednesday, March 12, 2003

<em>&gt; ARE WE IN A REALLY NEW WORLD? Yesterday, I                                  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggested that in some ways, we're headed backward                          
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward the nineteenth century. This stimulating,                            
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long, essay by Lee Harris in TCS argues the opposite:                       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that weapons of mass destruction together with                              
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fantasist Islamism or nihilist totalitarianism                              
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make our predicament completely and world-historically                      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new. I wish I could see a way to rebut this theory easily,                  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I cannot.                                                               
</em><br>
<p><p>I would counter that we are instead repeating the middle ages: a
<br>
Europe/Western Civilization beset on one side by Mongol Hordes, and on the
<br>
other by the Andalusian predations of a militaristic Muslim culture that
<br>
recognises no benighted principles of chivalry and gentlemanly conduct.
<br>
<p>Individuals who stood against the Muslim conquerors blow for blow come down
<br>
through history as rapacious leaders: Vlad the Impaler was the only person
<br>
in the Balkan region to stand against the Turks successfully and today he is
<br>
known as the archetypal vampire.
<br>
<p>Spaniards who did likewise against the Moorish occupation of Spain, and       
<br>
Italians against the Moorish occupation of Sicily are treated nearly as badly 
<br>
by the history books.

<br>
<p><em>&gt; THE PRE-EMPTIVE OPTION: Which leaves us with very few                       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good options. But the obvious one is pro-active pre-                        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emption: going in and getting rid of such regimes and                       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities, destroying them, or occupying them. But doing                     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so - invading terrorism-sponsoring states, before they                      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have formally attacked us - violates the basic principles                   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the international order we have understandably come                      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cherish.                                                                 
</em><br>
<p>The difficulty is in continuing to cherish principles that should be held when
<br>
treating with others of similar principles, but not when dealing with those
<br>
who do not hold them.
<br>
<p>There is much to be said for holding them in all cases. For example, Imperial
<br>
Japan did not recognise the Geneva Conventions, as they violated the Bushido
<br>
Code that all Japanese militarists subscribed to. Yet we treated Japanese
<br>
prisoners quite well despite how our own were treated, and we developed more
<br>
pity for the Japanese infantry man, who seemed to only know one strategy, that
<br>
of banzai!, than hatred. Still, the Japanese still wore a uniform, so you
<br>
could still pick him out of a crowd when he wasn't raping and pillaging his
<br>
conquered victims.
<br>
<p>Still, if the strategy of the enemy is that of leaderless insurgency, of use
<br>
of tactics which are proscribed by the Geneva Conventions as that of illlegal
<br>
combatants, what are we to gain by continuing to adhere to precepts which the
<br>
world either does not understand (in the case of the Western Left) or despises
<br>
(in the case of the Islamist radicals and other tyrannicals)?
<br>
<p>We do retain our own self respect, for one, if it is that which we derive that
<br>
respect from. We can choose how to adjust these principles to remain effective
<br>
against the threat without becoming as beastly as they.
<br>
<p>For example, the illegal combatants being held at Guantanamo Bay are being
<br>
treated humanely according to the Geneva Conventions, as has been certified by
<br>
the Red Cross, the Red Crescent, and other groups. So much so that the joke is
<br>
that the only complaints are too much sea breeze and no pillow mints. This is
<br>
far better than even the Geneva Conventions demand. Under those Conventions,
<br>
it is entirely within our rights to summarily execute anyone found to be
<br>
an illegal combatant, even without a military tribunal. This IS what our
<br>
pre-existing western principles demand and allow us to do, no matter what the
<br>
hew and cry is from leftist groups.
<br>
<p>What about immigration controls or filters? The US has already some of the
<br>
most liberal immigration laws in the world, and more people immigrate to the
<br>
US than to any other country. This is no accident, either, if you look into
<br>
the work done by the radical leftist Ford Foundation over the past 30 years
<br>
to make it so, specifically for the purpose of producing a new underclass of
<br>
disaffected proletariat immigrants who have never sufficiently assimilated
<br>
to the US (thanks to Ford Foundation lobbied laws against making English the
<br>
official language, etc).
<br>
<p>The US's proposed and enacted restrictions on travel and immigration to
<br>
the US are still in no way as restrictive as many other western nations
<br>
are. For example, just to travel to Russia, I, an American, need to obtain
<br>
an invitation from some Russian entity in order to obtain a visa to travel
<br>
there. The US accepts visa-less travellers from more nations than any other
<br>
country, even after the 9-11 fallout.
<br>
<p>Now, the primary opposition, I think, to our pre-emption policy is from those
<br>
nations either perceive themselves to be 'next on the list', or who are so
<br>
sensitive about their own image in the world that they fear how they will be
<br>
looked upon when nations like Iraq are no longer at the top of the list of
<br>
bad boy regimes. Saudi Arabia and Egypt, for example, will move that much
<br>
closer to the top of the list. Syria, Iran, and North Korea will be even
<br>
closer. North Korea KNOWS it is next in line, which is why it is practicing
<br>
some pre-emption of its own, as Iran is beginning to.
<br>
<p>Saudi Arabia apparently is going to announce some key democratic reforms when
<br>
and if we succeed against Iraq, they are so eager to get off that list.
<br>
<p>After these nations, the other primary opponents to our pre-emption policies
<br>
are those nations which have such despots as major client states. Iraq is a
<br>
major client state of France, Germany and Russia. The investments of these
<br>
countries in the Iraqi oil industry, and contracts for future development
<br>
(when sanctions are eased) are rather significant and well documented.
<br>
<p>The opposition of France is in particular rather understandable. In the words
<br>
of one commentator on CNN: &quot;25% of France is communist, while another 20% are
<br>
followers of the anti-semite fascist Le Pen, so essentially 45% of France is
<br>
certifiably insane.... Then you've got the fact that 20% of France is Muslim.&quot;
<br>
<p>So essentially Chirac is faced with the fact that 65% of his electorate
<br>
considers themselves enemies of the US. The Francophilic left in the US needs
<br>
to consider this when they continue to spout sound bites put out by French
<br>
intelligence. France is no longer an ally of the US, and might, if it works at
<br>
it, join the list of belligerent states. I've seen a few cars on the highway
<br>
with bumperstickers saying &quot;First Iraq, then France!&quot;. The logical failure of
<br>
this is only that Iraqis had no choice in the matter, while the French revel
<br>
in hating us.
<br>
<p>Is pre-emption objectively in conflict with our western principles? Possibly,
<br>
but are we even pre-empting anything? We are, after all, merely enforcing the
<br>
past 18 UN resolutions imposed by the UN since the end of the last Gulf War,
<br>
which Iraq agreed to obey in their 1991 Cease Fire Agreement. The violation
<br>
of any of these resolutions is justifiable grounds for any party to that
<br>
agreement to resume hostilities against Iraq. So the idea that our invasion of
<br>
Iraq is any sort of 'pre-emption' against future attacks is another sort of
<br>
false logic.
<br>
<p>As for future conflicts, would pre-emption be wrong? Under the same Geneva
<br>
Conventions, attacks on one nation by another, or on one nation by some group,
<br>
must be pre-empted by an announcement of a recognition of hostilities. Sneak
<br>
or surprise attacks as the opening battle in a war are not allowed. Pearl
<br>
Harbor was such a war crime. 9/11 was similarly a war crime, as was Hitler's
<br>
Blitzekrieg against Poland in 1939.
<br>
<p>What, however, if the nation we pre-emptively attack either does not recognise
<br>
the Geneva Conventions, or else or in addition, has a history of making sneak
<br>
attacks? Saddam, for example, made sneak attacks against both Iran and Kuwait
<br>
in opening hostilities with those nations. It was North Korea which opened
<br>
hostilities in the Korean War with a sneak attack on the South, and which
<br>
continues to sneak individuals across and around the DMZ to attack the South,
<br>
to kidnap Japanese and South Korean citizens, to kidnap the crew of the USS
<br>
Pueblo.
<br>
<p>By that basis, do we treat nations as they prefer to treat others?
