<p>It is so disappointing when a report purporting to be dispassionate
<br>
can't even hide its own disinformation very well. Files produced by any
<br>
new version of any software, when the file formats are not industry
<br>
standards (as WP, Lotus, and older versions of MS Office are
<br>
proprietary, while GIF, JPG, RTF, TXT, etc are standardized) are not
<br>
readable by older versions of that software or of any competitive
<br>
application indroduced prior to the new version. To act like this is
<br>
some new thing is disengenuous and expositive of the disinformational
<br>
agenda of the authors of this report.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Office 2003 will not run on Windows 95, 98, 98SE or Me. Microsoft is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very clear that it will run only on Windows XP and Windows 2000 with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SP3
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Service Pack 3) applied (W17). Currently over 60% of Microsoft's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business customers are still running Windows 95/98, and would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchase all new computers for an XP upgrade - new computers soon to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be obsoleted by Longhorn and Palladium.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so the authors are disparaging Microsoft for doing something which
<br>
Apple already did with it's OSX upgrade?

<em>&gt; The PC Industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The PC industry was once thriving, driven by rapid innovation. It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now down and it's not coming back.
</em><br>
<p>The PC industry is undergoing a transformation from a feature driven
<br>
luxury market to a commodity market, principally because there are no
<br>
new major advances in user productivity to make until neural implant
<br>
technology becomes available. Those who refuse to recognise this are
<br>
dead in the market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; --------------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Software Industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The PC software industry is in the final days of being destroyed by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft.
</em><br>
<p>The software industry, likewise, has failed to introduce any new major
<br>
advances in user productivity in several years. Until AI starts
<br>
becoming a major part of software applications, focusing on increasing
<br>
assistance to the user and without security weaknesses, the software
<br>
market will trend toward commodity pricing. Those who refuse to
<br>
recognise this will die.
