<em>&gt;Some cultures, e.g. the Amish or Quaker, do succeed sometimes
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;becoming a force against war.  But to the degree that we
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;the credit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(And moreover, it must be kept in mind that such cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to date have thrived only inside protective barriers erected

</em><br>
<p>Is thier a term for all  false value systems that are sold to people? Such 
<br>
as cultural value systems, media value systems, military value systems ect. 
<br>
The word propaganda really only refers to media.
<br>
I use the term value system meaning a system designed to bring about certain 
<br>
emotional responses to a certain stimuli. What is the correct terminology 
<br>
here?
<br>
<p>Although I see no difference between them except that the media can have a 
<br>
much greater effect. It is interesting to note that the evolution of culture 
<br>
is no different than the evolution of any other meme. It is also interesting 
<br>
to note that as long as you fit into a greater memeplex such as democracy 
<br>
ect.. the details of a culture might as well be random from an evolutionary 
<br>
standpiont.
<br>
<p>All these memes that control emotion control people. All these value systems 
<br>
have been sorted out to fit the mold of america. They haven't been chosen 
<br>
but natural selected. In theory, we have been taught what is positive 
<br>
emotional response and what is a negative emotional response. We have been 
<br>
taught to fit this mold of america. It has become our Nature. Although a 
<br>
very flexible mold it is still a mold. It has a range of possible outcomes 
<br>
to shape it's citizens. Such ranges only come to light when the media turns 
<br>
the tide too quickly.
<br>
How much of this is true?
