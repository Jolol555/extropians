Lee Corbin asks:
<br>
<em>&gt; What is the emotional reaction of those protesting the war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to American setbacks in the field?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I conjecture that reports of American setbacks are received 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with gratification by most war protesters.  After all,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for those who see George Bush as a greater threat and a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater enemy than Saddam Hussein, such a reaction would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be practically inevitable.  Wouldn't it?
</em><br>
<p>This does seem to be a common response among some anarcho-libertarians,
<br>
as found for example on the cypherpunks list.  You can read their comments
<br>
at <a href="http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/">http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/</a>.  (Warning, 95% of the messages
<br>
are spam now, so you have to learn to scan down to find message threads
<br>
with a variety of posters.  Takes a few minutes to train the eye, then
<br>
it's not so bad.)
<br>
<p>For example, one comment reads,
<br>
<a href="http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/current/msg00067.html">http://www.inet-one.com/cypherpunks/current/msg00067.html</a>:
<br>
<p>:    Hey, this war is looking better all the time. We got our first fragging
<br>
: already, and the US troops are finding themselves no real match for the
<br>
: Iraqis. I just heard that there's at least 1 million well armed Ba'ath party
<br>
: irregulars, plus unknown numbers of &quot;armed Iraqi tribes&quot;, besides the 400,000
<br>
: strong Iraqi army which clearly isn't rolling over like projected.
<br>
:    Could it be that the US will actually get it's ass kicked? Unless dimwit
<br>
: dubya decides to start carpet bombing the civilian population, there's no way
<br>
: they can beat those numbers. The US airpower does them zilch good in the cities
<br>
: otherwise.
<br>
<p>Tim May, whom some of you know, adds:
<br>
<p>: The train wreck is developing nicely.
<br>
<p>Cypherpunks had a similar response to an earlier use of American
<br>
government power which they opposed, the siege of Waco.  The initial
<br>
action against the Branch Davidian compound led to significant losses
<br>
by the government forces, and those were generally cheered by the
<br>
cypherpunks.
