<p><p>I don't think that there is any reason not to trust those pictures, since 
<br>
they never state that they were taken the moment before the tragedy 
<br>
occurred.  I've even found pro-Israeli sites that agree that they were 
<br>
real.  IE probably intends people to draw misleading conclusions form them, 
<br>
since the ones on the IE site are cropped a bit to make comparisons of the 
<br>
background harder, but I respect the fact that they seem to be truthful 
<br>
about that issue.
<br>
<p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
