<p><em>&gt; And it's not like we don't have the technology. Look at those souped-up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M16's our troops have now. It doesn't seem like it would take much extra
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight to add a small camera on each weapon so each kill-shot could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recorded for posterity. Perhaps editted into a family video for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widow and orphans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think having more video would make everybody much more supportive of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the war. It should be possible to have a little camera on each bomb or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artillery shell. In fact, I think the U.S. should personalize each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every bomb, give it it's own URL and let children post messages which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be printed via some sort of hand-held dot-matrix printer on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; munition as it's loaded. Combine this with the camera on the bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmitting it's last image so you could actually match up individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead iraqis with the bomb that killed them. Then the kids could write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqi widows and orphans explaning why their husbands and fathers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to die, and it'd all be archived for future historians.
</em><br>
<p>What a  bunch of terriffic ideas! Now wouldn't that be fun. Finally we would
<br>
all be happily  engaged in a global war game. The American kids counting
<br>
smashed bodies and give the deadly wounded Iraqui babies a remote control
<br>
coup de grace. And finally: Computerized bombs, shells and bulletts would
<br>
give us Militant Pacifists (MP) the chance to hack into the system and
<br>
eliminate the bombs on their flight or maybe with some cool hacker tools
<br>
reverse their ballistic curve and direct them straight back to the shooters,
<br>
which I would definitely prefer besides teaching Iraqui children to write to
<br>
the widows and orphants weeping back home in &quot;God's Own Country&quot; and
<br>
explaining how MPs managed to turn a tool of war against the aggressor.
