<p>
I am beginning to think that this* common belief is affecting the way people 
<br>
view the Iraq war.
<br>
<p>*That a continuous upgraded net mind will make humans be able to control 
<br>
their instincts until eventually there is no more violence.*
<br>
<p>Such a statement is extremely theoretical. Although genetic changes or even 
<br>
IA might give us that ability I am doubtful that our instincts can be kept 
<br>
in check otherwise.
<br>
<p>1. Many anti-war activists believe that this* is possible and that war 
<br>
should be avoided.
<br>
2. Many war activists believe that this* is possible and that war is 
<br>
progressing globalization and thereby causing this to happen sooner.
<br>
<p>The other belief is that this is not possible. If this is not possible, 
<br>
given our technology at this time, than these instincts for power and 
<br>
violence will always be present in society.
<br>
<p>*That these instincts can’t be controlled and have to be kept in check*
<br>
<p>Then the argument is what systems are best at keeping these instincts in 
<br>
check? The best systems would be ones that have the smallest percentage of 
<br>
people that need to be kept in check. Stopping the problem before it starts. 
<br>
So then the argument is what is the best propaganda to send people so that 
<br>
they have very little ability to revert to these instincts. There may be 
<br>
better forms of control than propaganda but these systems will never be 
<br>
100%. That is until a method of control such as genetic changes or IA can be 
<br>
used.
