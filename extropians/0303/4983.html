<em>&gt; Is thier a term for all  false value systems that are sold to people? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such as cultural value systems, media value systems, military value 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I use the term value system meaning a system designed to bring about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain emotional responses to a certain stimuli. What is the correct 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Do you believe there are true value systems?  How do you 
<br>
distinquish true from false value systems?  Perhaps that will 
<br>
give a clue as to what to term the un-true or less than true 
<br>
value systems.  Do you believe the truth of a value system is 
<br>
binary or that you can intellectually fully analyze and judge a 
<br>
value system?  We get into interesting questions quickly here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All these memes that control emotion control people. All these value 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems have been sorted out to fit the mold of america. They haven't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been chosen but natural selected. In theory, we have been taught what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; positive emotional response and what is a negative emotional response. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have been taught to fit this mold of america. It has become our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nature. Although a very flexible mold it is still a mold. It has a range 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of possible outcomes to shape it's citizens. Such ranges only come to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; light when the media turns the tide too quickly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How much of this is true?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What are you including in &quot;media&quot;?  What is normally included 
<br>
excludes a lot of the means of transmitting and perfecting meme 
<br>
infestations.  What is normally included is increasing the voice 
<br>
of a few large players and the voice of what the government 
<br>
wishes to be believed.  It is usually quite empty of any real 
<br>
values or at least of unambiguous mention of same.  It is a 
<br>
tissue of assumptions, rationalizations and manipulations.
