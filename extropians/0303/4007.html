<p><p><em>&gt; Rafal writes
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ### One way of avoiding the conundrum is to use Rawl's veil of
</em><br>
ignorance,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; put yourself in the position of the experimental subject, and consider
</em><br>
one
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; additional option - not flipping the coin at all. You can decide to run
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; good experience only, giving the test subject a certainty of good
</em><br>
experience
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, forget about the coin, and just proceed straight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the generous and kind choice of supplying a beneficial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience with 100% probability.  Well... of course this &quot;avoids&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conundrum, and also thereby ignores its lesson.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're quite right that this would be the more moral choice, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we don't learn anything from it.  The real question is, should you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flip this coin, thereby causing its attendant consequences, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should you by default cause nothing to occur?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now change the polarity so that in 90% of the cases the subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will have a bad experience, and in only ten a good experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Should the coin be flipped in this case, or is the default
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (nothing occurs) to be preferred?
</em><br>
<p>### There is no default when a sentient starts thinking. You can be good,
<br>
9good/1bad, 1good/9bad, totally bad, do nothing, or anything in between. The
<br>
presence of parallelism does not directly change the valuation, except in
<br>
the
<br>
presence of multiple local copies (when our seven levels of identity kick
<br>
in), or if the single local copy adjusts its
<br>
wishes in some way to the knowledge about the four levels. Either way, it is
<br>
the local preference of sentients that constitutes the basis for ethics. All
<br>
ethics is local, that is my contention.
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In level III there is the additional wrinkle of your actions causally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; influencing the quantum evolution of the whole experimental system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Basically, when making the decision you decohere into three versions, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sheaves of histories - the no-coin-flip, the choose-90% and choose-10%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; histories (the last sheaf of  histories is equivalent to you turning
</em><br>
into a
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sadist, I think). Your subjective experience of making the decision is
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equivalent of a quantum process of decoherence, whose outcomes will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different measures depending on the properties of the system (your
</em><br>
brain).
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If your brain is influenced by my words, on the classical level, it will
</em><br>
be
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accompanied by an increase in the measure of branches with the
</em><br>
no-coin-flip
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiment on the MWI, or level III analysis.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Because you have benevolently assumed that the &quot;no coin flip&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; option results in the same circumstances for the subject as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favorable outcome does.  Isn't that right?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes.
<br>
--------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In this case the conclusion is still the same as in level I and II,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you should skip the flip and choose good, in accordance with Tegmark's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statement that level III does not increase the number of distinct
</em><br>
entities
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (or types of particle configurations) compared to level I and II.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will be also an infinite number of level I copies of you decohering into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the three sheaves, but without a direct causal relationship to each
</em><br>
other.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How does the conclusion depend on which level we are discussing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Although I do appreciate you clarifying what physically happens.)
</em><br>
<p>### I mean to say that the considering the physically different levels still
<br>
should lead to the same conclusion.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As aside to Lee, you are also not duty-bound to make them in first
</em><br>
place.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree.  Nor is one duty-bound to aid drowning swimmers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or victims one comes across by chance in traffic accidents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Aside to Dr. Smigrodzki: are *you* duty-bound by the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your state or country to go to their aid?)
</em><br>
<p>### AFAIK, I am not, although the state of Virginia could draft me in case
<br>
of a disaster.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's simply not my responsibility whether or not someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drowns who I happen to notice while walking along the beach.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nonetheless, I adamantly claim that one *ought* to help out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when one can.  But it is by no means an obligation or duty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially in a free country.
</em><br>
<p>### I agree.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But suppose that I could press a button here on my desk, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a random human being who happens to live about 10^10^29 meters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from here gets a new copy going among us.  Let me further state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he or she will neither be a burden nor an asset to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rest of humanity in the new location, but will---after a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively short time of disorientation---come to experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great happiness among us.
</em><br>
<p>### That is the point - you are assuming the existence of a device changing
<br>
a non-local situation into a local one - one that you can influence directly
<br>
with your actions. This is as much of a difference as the difference between
<br>
the unconceived children and drowning swimmers (although a different one).
