Hi everyone,
<br>
<p>I have an urgent need for some good non-technical articles about
<br>
cryonics and/or physical immortality. I need not only the article, but
<br>
also the author's agreement for the article to be translated to French
<br>
and published to the web.
<br>
<p>The reason is, I have been talking on the phone today with a
<br>
journalist of the main French TV channel, and he agreed to quote a
<br>
certain URL of mine (see below) on a hugely popular show IF I provide
<br>
interesting content (in French of course) about cryonics and/or
<br>
physical immortality there. That's an occasion I don't want to miss.
<br>
The show might well ignite the long awaited public debate about the
<br>
Martinot situation (still unsolved, and that will be evoked on the
<br>
show). The journalist seems quite sympathetic (he told me for example,
<br>
regarding the Martinot situation, that he regretted France didn't have
<br>
more respect for individual liberties, etc.).
<br>
<p>The show -- whose theme will be &quot;Immortality and cryonics&quot; -- is in
<br>
less than a week (March 10th), so unless he can see the website
<br>
Thursday or Friday, it won't work. I need to make the web site, paint
<br>
it with nice colors, find the texts, get authorizations, translate
<br>
them, put them online.
<br>
<p>The TV show is for everyone, so the articles must be relatively easy
<br>
to read by everyone. And short ! (if a part is self-contained, and the
<br>
author agrees to its separate publication, then it might also work)
<br>
And I need the agreement of the author, as said above. If you point me
<br>
to an article, and I need to ask the agreement, and it comes in two
<br>
days, then it won't do for this occasion. So as much as possible
<br>
please point me (privately) to articles of which *you* are the author,
<br>
or of which you know the author personally and you can get his
<br>
agreement.
<br>
<p>I am a small publisher in France and the website on which this will go
<br>
is a companion to a book series I am in the process of developing.
<br>
(Though we rush things for this occasion, the texts mentionned below
<br>
will stay beyond that occasion.) Each book of the series (about 80
<br>
pages apiece) will tackle one theme linked to the moment we're living,
<br>
the possibilities before us, and the future, in a somewhat
<br>
transhumanistish perspective. They will be concise, rational, clear,
<br>
acessible, interesting (which isn't such an obvious combination
<br>
nowadays in France), self-contained and targeted to the educated,
<br>
general public.
<br>
<p>Among the projected themes are
<br>
<p>- transhumanist manifestos
<br>
- existential risks
<br>
- cryonics
<br>
- biology of aging and longevity
<br>
- the biotech
<br>
<p>The website will publish some (or all, don't know yet) of the printed
<br>
texts, along with lighter and shorter texts, all in French of course.
<br>
<p>Though I will commission some French-writing authors, I also expect to
<br>
select and translate some existing texts published to the web or
<br>
elsewhere. There is no urgency in general for all this, and I will
<br>
take the time to search the web for adequate articles, and ask people
<br>
if they are willing to grant authorization. In fact I didn't intend to
<br>
post on the list at all, but confronted today to this unexpected
<br>
occasion and urgency, I figured it might be the best thing to do, and
<br>
that exposing the project at the same time wouldn't hurt.
<br>
<p>I think the project in general might be the best way (available to me
<br>
at least) to trigger reflection and debate of good quality here on
<br>
those themes.
<br>
<p>Suggestions and propositions (probably better in private, but I'll
<br>
read the list, too) are of course welcome.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
<p>Jacques Du Pasquier
<br>
<p>PS: By doing a quick catching up I see that there was much talk about
<br>
how the hell France could be such and such, and in what measure it
<br>
deserved to be the target of absolutely all jokes, or only all jokes
<br>
of a certain kind. Well... I am Swiss anyway.
