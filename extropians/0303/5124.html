<p><em>&gt; &gt; Who really cares about [PR], if you succeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in destroying a murderous, ruthless, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; horrifying regime like the U.S.S.R.?   Okay,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so the lefties scored a few points on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; campuses when the U.S. set up a pro-Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iran.  But the end result was that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no U.S.S.R. today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I actually don't know much of the Iran episode, I got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the image from what you said of the US marching troops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a country holding an election and saying, &quot;we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think it's democratic.  Do it our way&quot;,
</em><br>
<p>No, that would never happen.  On one or two occasions
<br>
that I know of (there could be others), a democratically
<br>
elected regime *was* overthrown by a CIA sponsored coup.
<br>
Nothing public, you understand.  And it was done, never
<br>
forget, in a ceaseless &quot;cold&quot; war against the U.S.S.R.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As to the USSR, we were taught, as the coming down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet collapse were the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big events of my middle school years, that much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bloodbath that was the Soviet regime wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even known until after the fall.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, it was known all right.  It was known by everyone
<br>
who didn't have the ideological blinders of a certain
<br>
segment of political spectrum.  Since *I* was in 
<br>
Junior High School in the sixties, I had personally
<br>
known many people who refused to ever admit that 
<br>
Joseph Stalin had done anything wrong.  One of those,
<br>
the father of one of my friends, went to his grave
<br>
still resolutely refusing to entertain the notion
<br>
that Joseph Stalin was not the greatest friend of
<br>
the working man the Earth has ever seen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would certainly throw bad light on a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of US actions, but I can't know how aware people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really were/politicians were.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, well, if the leftists (who are *still* very
<br>
much with us, usually out in the streets marching
<br>
for one damn thing or another) have their way, 
<br>
this is exactly how it will go down in the history
<br>
books:  &quot;Because no one knew about of the enormity
<br>
of the crimes of the Soviet State until the release
<br>
of the Verona files in the 1990's, the anti-Soviet
<br>
actions of the U.S. were paranoid and unconscionable.&quot;
<br>
<p>Gee.  Where to start.  Well, even leftists with
<br>
open minds, e.g. Bertrand Russell, became aware
<br>
that all was not well behind the Iron Curtain as
<br>
early as the 20's and 30's.  A number of others
<br>
saw through the sham in the 1940's and 50's, but
<br>
it wasn't until 1967 with the publication of
<br>
Alexander Sohzhenitsyn's &quot;The Gulag Archipelago&quot;
<br>
that the evidence became overwhelming to all but
<br>
the most dogmatic leftists.
<br>
<p>So yes, the U.S. state department, as well as the
<br>
governments of almost all nations, knew perfectly
<br>
well with what they were dealing vis a vis the
<br>
USSR.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...since I have no clue what Iraqis of any slant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually do feel about this war outside of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicting forces of the press, the government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and potentially fake web-logs. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly.  Well, there are probably some Iraqis
<br>
living in the U.S. who could join this list or in
<br>
other ways give us tremendous insight, but it would
<br>
only take two for there to be two different opinions.
<br>
Yet over time, if history is any guide, the truth
<br>
will emerge as to what the Iraqi consciousness is
<br>
like for most people now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2. An ex-wife of an important Iraqi general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    is found to be living in New York under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    an assumed name.  How far should the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    U.S. military go to extract information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    that may help them win a key battle?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Iraq is invading and killing citizens in America,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do what you must if it involves torturing, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopefully with at least an ounce of regret.  If the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ex-wife is guilty herself of atrocities, then maybe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pending the pertinence of the information.  If she is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent, and we're the invaders, no. 
</em><br>
<p>I meant to win a battle in Iraq, the U.S. 
<br>
captures and tortures a civilian living
<br>
in New York.  I would be completely opposed,
<br>
and for this reason:  how a battle goes is
<br>
a pretty nebulous thing, and to break all
<br>
the rules in such a case would be unforgivable.
<br>
But I'm glad that we agree that if she knew
<br>
where an atom bomb that was gonna go off was,
<br>
then anything to get the information out of
<br>
her would be okay by you and me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3. Baghdad is about to fall, but a convoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    makes a wrong turn, and some cooks are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    captured by some very angry and hateful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    Iraqi soldiers.  *Should* they torture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    him, given that they have seen countless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    comrades cut down by American machine-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    weapons, and have been hating Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    and non-Muslims their whole lives?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would recommend that they should have surrendered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves to the US, (not meaning I'd have the gall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to actually say this to a group of machine-gun
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wielding foreigners), and explain that America has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huge burden of not offending the rest of the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further; they'd be treated better as a POW than on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own (although this does contradict &quot;Live free or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Good.  That's all true, of course.
<br>
I would also do everything that I could
<br>
to emphasize to them the insignificance
<br>
of what they would gain by their revenge,
<br>
and, if permitted, try to instill some
<br>
extropian thinking into them---their 
<br>
rifles hardly being conducive to my
<br>
best efforts at explication, I grant
<br>
your point!  8^D
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 4. It's 1965 and Israeli agents have just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    found a notorious war-criminal in South
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    America, and one of the Mossad agents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    had a brother tortured and killed by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    this same war criminal.  You are one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    of the other agents.  The choice of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    group is either to kill him or torture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    him first before killing him (extradition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    is not an option).  One of the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    agents does not want to torture him first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    What should you do?  What should you be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    in favor of your group doing?  What would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    you say, and to whom?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No torture.  It would serve nothing but petty revenge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hannah Arendt's book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forth a brave stance from someone with close
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections to the third Reich, that the 'evil' was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banal and not this epitome of monstrosity most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associate with the Nazi regime.
</em><br>
<p>Right on!  Totally agree.  I &quot;understand&quot; why my
<br>
friend and fellow secret agent wants to do this,
<br>
I do fully understand.  But if the strength is
<br>
within me, I should do everything to talk him 
<br>
out of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Not that I don't understand *why*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the coalition would choose this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; strategy in the war, but certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it's not a fair fight to start with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Gasp!  Choke!  What do you think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is, a game?  What do you want to see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maybe the Russians come in on the Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; side so that we get a really good show?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I don't think it's a game, nor do I want to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Russians involved in this.  Further I wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want it to be a fair fight, as the day a dictatorship
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can have a fair fight with the strongest nuclear power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the world, [insert end of civilization scenario
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here].  I'm not entirely certain why you got that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion from what I said as it at least seemed to me to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be consistent with everything else I had been writing.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  I may have overreacted to the phrase &quot;fair fight&quot;.
<br>
If you'd like me too, I'll go back and resurrect the
<br>
context and be more careful.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Oh good grief.  And so I suppose that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if the U.S. were to nuke Baghdad right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; off the map with a 20-megatonner, you'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have &quot;some&quot; moral outrage against the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; U.S., but you'd also direct your outrage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at more than one source, say, Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and Iraq?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The lenses you're looking through seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a little tilted to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oh, no.  I'd have &quot;plenty&quot; of outrage toward the US. 
</em><br>
<p>Good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, though, if Saddam's regime did something like a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bio-chem warfare that the US weren't prepared against,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the US nukes out of fear, I'd have outrage toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam too.
</em><br>
<p>Fair enough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now, if before we touch Baghdad, the nuke flies to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Washington, then *all* the outrage goes toward the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam regime.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is an interesting scenario, thanks for
<br>
dreaming it up.  Baghdad, 9 April 2003.  A nuclear
<br>
scientist rushes in and says, &quot;Beloved Leader, the
<br>
2nd of our two bombs has made it to Washington!
<br>
Do you still want to keep the last one in reserve
<br>
against the Imperialist unbelievers in the field?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes,&quot; says Saddam Hussein, &quot;but I will now tell
<br>
them, heh, heh...&quot;
<br>
<p>At that moment a bomb crashes in the ceiling and
<br>
Saddam, critically injured says &quot;Nuke the stinking
<br>
American bastards' capital.  NOW!!&quot;
<br>
<p>We know what the Left would say:  They'd say, &quot;See,
<br>
two wrongs don't make a right, you should have known
<br>
better than to make them so angry.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Right replies, &quot;Well, we should have invaded
<br>
SOONER!  Besides, they hated us so much already
<br>
it was only a question of time!&quot;
<br>
<p>And on the argument would go.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; but, so long as it's the Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being nuked...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well no, it could be the British or Australian troops,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the Turkish should they decide to invade.  And it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not that I'd justify it, just that I wouldn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be outraged, as I'd never get outraged by an expected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reaction to an event.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  You are quite right.  Come to think of it
<br>
I would not be &quot;outraged&quot;.  In fact, I half-expected
<br>
Saddam to test his new bomb in the desert the night
<br>
of the Dan Rather interview, just to show his friend
<br>
Dan that he was destroying his WMD.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Sometimes the right thing---that is, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thing that you will approve of if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reflect on it long enough and allow all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your knowledge and reason to come into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; play---, sometimes the right thing is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to surrender.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; okay, I understand 'right' as you explain here, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree, but looking on the smallest scale: a force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intends to kill me,
</em><br>
<p>okay
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will not surrender to death save when my death would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benefit those whom I ally with (friends/loved ones...
</em><br>
<p>okay
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now if you agree with this principle, put it in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the perspective of who and what Saddam and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; henchmen may value and then realize we intend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either kill, or try then execute him and a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them (presuming living).  
</em><br>
<p>Right.  I don't expect Saddam to ally himself to 
<br>
be captured, or to go gently into that good night.
<br>
I would be surprised if he didn't use every weapon
<br>
at his command.  I would be further surprised if
<br>
at the end he didn't try for as much revenge as
<br>
possible.
<br>
<p>But what do I know?  I thought there was a good
<br>
chance he'd choose exile.  (I would have.  But
<br>
then I don't think that I have the right stuff
<br>
to be a ruthless dictator.)  Perhaps without all
<br>
those damned demonstrations giving him moral 
<br>
support he would have.
