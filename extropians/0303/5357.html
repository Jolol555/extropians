Well, it's quite clear that 2/3 of the Senate didn't vote a declaration 
<br>
of war.  Of course that's not international law, but to me that seems a 
<br>
much muddier argument.  For one thing, I don't know much about 
<br>
international law, except that it seems to be evolving in the direction 
<br>
of &quot;The powerful do what they want, and everyone else better get out of 
<br>
the way&quot;.  (I base this on such things as the WTO rather than the 
<br>
current war, which is more or less an abberation, however its legality 
<br>
is eventaully decided.)
