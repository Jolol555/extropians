Errrr.. Remarque (really Kramer spelled with a French pen name for shock value) wrote about WW1...WW1...Not the funny fellow with a ugly moustache, whom the Germans, thought was a teutonic, messiah...this was WW1..envy of England's Empire, fearful of a rising industrial Russia (even under the poluted Czars), not the death camp war, ok? All Quiet on the Western Front was world war 1. Kiddies between 13-16 are easily shaped and looking for approval and acceptance. Their teachers bear the responsibility of deciding whom the jugend will be against. Its a shame that they chose the Great Dictator, Saddam. But, hey, that's Europe for ya.

<p>Humania Exulted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;You're twisting reality here. 13 to 16 year old humans are sensitive enough to know what a war is. If freedom and peace loving schoolboys and girls organise a protest ralley against a US killing campaign and their teachers allow them to leave one hour earlier, you come along with your paranoid patriotism and compare it with Nazi teachers urging the boys to sign up for the Wehrmacht???? &gt;&gt;
