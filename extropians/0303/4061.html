<em>&gt; &gt; I would certainly be interested to hear what extropians think of Patents
</em><br>
(at
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least, mechanical innovation patents)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coming from the IT/software/Open Source side of things, I am extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptical of patents.  The patent system seems to reflect a 19th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century outlook on a mostly static, mechanical world which is wildy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at odds with a fast moving 21st century world increasingly dominated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by software and information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the basic themes on this list is progress and in fact the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accelerating speed of progress.  If you measure the subjective time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a patent grant not in years but by the amount of change taking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place in the meantime, then the current fixed n-year objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifetime means that patents are running for an ever increasing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective time.  Back in the 1800s, a time to market of a decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have been realistic.  Nowadays, a company may not even remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its products of a decade ago.  Current patent lifetimes of ~20 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are an eternity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A patent protects against a competitor simply stealing the inventor's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blueprints and outproducing him.  (There are also more specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws against the theft of business secrets, which I'll ignore here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the sake of argument.)  I think most of us consider that a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A patent also protects against a competitor seeing an invention and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reproducing it more or less independently.  Once you know that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something can be done, figuring out how to is usually less difficult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think the virtue of this sort of protection is not so clearcut,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since we are not talking about blind imitation but about people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being partly creative in their own right.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A patent also protects against a competitor coming up with the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing entirely independently without ever having heard of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original invention.  It effectively screws out the second inventor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his investment.  And as progress keeps accelerating, such parallel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development becomes more and more common.  I think this type of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection is objectionable.  Of course, in practice, it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impossible to prove whether a design was imitated or arrived at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; independently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nominally, a patent protects a single invention.  This may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been true in the steam age, when some tinkerer invented a great,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuming foobazler.  Nowadays you have to consider that the patent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protection effectively also reaches out to anything that is based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a foobazler or includes a foobazler somewhere as a small part.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A patent removes a whole path of development from that available
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the competition.  Again, this wasn't such a big issue when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress was slow, but with the current and accelerating turnover
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of technology this is an ever growing obstacle to further progress
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the direction covered by the patent.  Obviously this is even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse for broad or generic patents that cover methods of doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things rather than actual devices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you talk to some crypto people, they will tell you that the RSA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patent was rather more successful in preventing widespread adoption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of cryptography than US export regulations.  You may also have heard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of talk in Green circles of acquiring patents with the express
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose of obstructing biotech research.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Patents have become a part of business, but in ways that do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deal with protecting the inventor's investment.  There are so many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patents that have been granted that it is virtually impossible for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineers to check whether their product violates any of them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corporations recognize this and try to build comprehensive patent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; portfolios for offensive and defensive action.  That competitor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there cuts into your market?  Sue him for patent infringement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simply by being in the same market segment he is bound to accidentally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run into your patents.  Somebody sues you for patent infringement?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Countersue them, they're likely to violate some of your own patents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Big companies, who hold numerous patents, have little to fear.  With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their fat portfolios they negotiate cross-licensing contracts with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other big players.  For small companies, upstarts, the much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; touted garage inventors, the perspective is very grim.  Patents
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cover only part of a complex product or are so old that people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already consider the idea as common knowledge can be used as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapon to suppress competition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A favorite are submarine patents.  Take out a patent on an invention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that lies in the mainstream of technical development.  Don't develop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any product, just sit back and wait some years.  By now the market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is full of products that, unbeknownst by their creators, infringe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on your patent.  Even better if it has become part of some standard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Have your lawyers write threatening letters and watch the royalties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rolling in.  This looks like a perversion of the ideas behind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patent system, but it is neverless sanctioned by it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then there is reasonable licensing.  In theory, a patent holder is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obliged to license his invention to competitors at a reasonable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fee.  In practice, it is not clear what a reasonable fee constitutes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I wish you good luck enforcing this of a patent holder who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply doesn't want to grant any licenses.  In the times when an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invention equalled a product, this was of little concern.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nowadays an invention may affect thousands of products and a patent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may keep them from coming into existence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As an Open Source person, &quot;reasonable licensing&quot; translates to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prohibition for me.  Since I don't charge anything, there is no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I could recoup even a minimal license fee.  Patents assume that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every invention and use of an invention takes places in the setting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a for-profit business.  The patent system punishes the Open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Source world for stepping outside of this traditional setting.  A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patent effectively removes an invention from the Open Source economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the Open Source setting, each patent destroys a piece of (potential)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress and the path behind it.  In this context, patents are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unmitigated evil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short:  Although I can understand the moviation behind the patent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, I consider it at best as of dubious value and ill-adapted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the times.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like other posters in this thread I come from a particular background
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that necessarily influences my views.  For example, I have no idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatsoever how the pharmaceutical industry operates and I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judge the value of the patent system in that context.  In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computer industry, patents help the biggest players to establish a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chokehold on everybody else and kill diversity and progress.

<p>### You made many good points. I fully agree with you that the current
<br>
patent system suffers from many problems. Especially in the case of
<br>
software, there are many patents (I am being told) which do not really pass
<br>
the &quot;obviousness&quot; test - whether the patent content  is truly a novel
<br>
development or merely a routine extension of existing methods (like the
<br>
infamous &quot;one-click online shopping&quot; patent). One way of assuring that such
<br>
patents are not granted would be to have the patent office publish a
<br>
description of the patent claims, without explanation of the patented idea
<br>
itself, and have the public examine and come up with the idea independently,
<br>
within some specified period of time (e.g. 1/20 of the proposed duration of
<br>
the patent). If it is truly novel, hardly anybody will come up with the
<br>
trick on their own, and if they do, they will share in the royalties (e.g.
<br>
1/4 for the second inventor, 1/8/ for the third, etc.). If the idea is
<br>
obvious, there will be too many inventors calling in with their independent
<br>
derivations, making it impossible to get any royalties at all due to the
<br>
lack of an effective monopoly situation. Also, this trick would limit the
<br>
duration of patent protection - asking for too long a period would leave too
<br>
much time for competitors to call in their proposals.
<br>
<p>Another trick might be to limit the number of patents that can be held by
<br>
one legal entity (e.g. increasing the price of the patent exponentially with
<br>
each patent). This would not impact the lone inventor, but would prevent
<br>
companies from amassing patent portfolios for extortion purposes, and would
<br>
force them to sell the patents to management companies which would have
<br>
strong incentives to license the patents to the maximum number of users.
<br>
<p>You could even allow private bidders to force an auction of a patent
<br>
(similar to what I proposed in the &quot;Private roads&quot; thread).
<br>
<p>You can give the &quot;fair use&quot; exemption to all non-profit uses, including
<br>
OpenSoftware projects.
<br>
<p>There are methods of making it work.
<br>
<p>Of course, companies unwilling to put up with this system could always use
<br>
secrecy to shield their ideas. No coercion here.
