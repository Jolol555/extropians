<em>&gt; &gt; This was hyped as the TV event of the season,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but so far it has been a big letdown. The audience is disappointed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; All that anticipation has been build up, but there's no war in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sight. Not only has the climax been delayed, it may never happen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at all. Lousy script that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just as with the Lord of the Rings movie, which wasn't released in all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its expanded DVD glory till a year after the theatrical release, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best video from our new war won't show up till long after the event. For 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, on Cryptome they linked to a neat film of an AC-130 gunship 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firing its weapons on hapless Afghanis. It was neat to see the effort, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of 105mm shells expended, to kill just one guy! It was an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infrared video, and the people-targets were all lit up like glowing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stick figures. Coolest part was when they finally hit this one guy and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can see a severed limb flying off, still glowing with body heat!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But sadly, you won't see that on CNN.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And it's not like we don't have the technology. Look at those souped-up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; M16's our troops have now. It doesn't seem like it would take much extra 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weight to add a small camera on each weapon so each kill-shot could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recorded for posterity. Perhaps editted into a family video for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widow and orphans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think having more video would make everybody much more supportive of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the war. It should be possible to have a little camera on each bomb or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artillery shell. In fact, I think the U.S. should personalize each and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every bomb, give it it's own URL and let children post messages which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be printed via some sort of hand-held dot-matrix printer on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; munition as it's loaded. Combine this with the camera on the bomb 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmitting it's last image so you could actually match up individual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead iraqis with the bomb that killed them. Then the kids could write 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqi widows and orphans explaning why their husbands and fathers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to die, and it'd all be archived for future historians.
