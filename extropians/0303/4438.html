<p>ah, but there already is an entity known as American
<br>
Fries.  As best I can tell, they are grits/homefries.
<br>
<p>here's a menu listing both American, and French fries.
<br>

<br>
<p>Now, to the actual subject that this was originally
<br>
about...certainly you are right, the government has
<br>
nothing to do with this.  However, I question that it
<br>
was done in actual levity.  McDonalds has notably
<br>
always held a conservative approach to their
<br>
commercials and released a particularly patriotic
<br>
commercial before this stunt.  It seems* very much as
<br>
if it's done to appeal to the excessively patriotic,
<br>
French-haters.  Ironic the change to freedom fries,
<br>
when according to this columnist: 
<br>
<a href="http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_16-3-2003_pg3_5">http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_16-3-2003_pg3_5</a>
<br>
the word France actually means freedom and the fries
<br>
were called such since they're freely fried. 
<br>
Purportedly the Belgians invented &quot;French Fries&quot;
<br>
making the game even sillier, although I know of no
<br>
proof of this.
<br>
<p>* - Something else notable that restaurants have done
<br>
recently is to remove French dishes from their menus. 
<br>
A large liquor store around my locale also refused to
<br>
sell any French wines.  Now certainly they have the
<br>
right to do this at any given time, but I personally
<br>
find it rather crass, and don't see any good (even in
<br>
the pro-war perspective of those who do this) that can
<br>
arise from this.
