<p>Hubert, I have not been following this conversation, so I may be stepping
<br>
in a bit ill-informed.  But with respect to the statement above -- it *ain't*
<br>
going to happen.
<br>
<p>I'll cite two pieces of information from a recent PBS special about Saddam.
<br>
(a) His personal library is filled with books on the life and philosophy of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one Josef Stalin.
<br>
(b) He is responsible for the deaths of ~190,000 people (non-war related)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;during his rule [this is at the low end of estimates I have seen].
<br>
<p>Let us top this off with a NY Times article today of individuals having
<br>
to choose between fighting or being shot:

&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraqi Soldiers Say It Was Fight or Die
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;By DEXTER FILKINS
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/27/international/worldspecial/27AMBU.html?pagewanted=print">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/27/international/worldspecial/27AMBU.html?pagewanted=print</a>

<p>The man rose to power as a hit-man within his party.  He does *not* understand
<br>
the concept of &quot;peaceful disarmament&quot;.  Unfortunately he has spread his perspective
<br>
to hundreds if not thousands of other Iraqi's in his &quot;regime&quot;.
<br>
<p>It is a really sad situation -- but one has to face the fact that &quot;humanity&quot;
<br>
can get cancer and one has to deal with the really hard situations of how
<br>
one excises it.
<br>
<p>The fundamental problem with the German and French positions is this.  If Saddam
<br>
is responsible for murdering several hundred thousand people over the last couple
<br>
of decades *what* precisely is to prevent him from murdering another several hundred
<br>
thousand people over the next couple of decades?  There is an old chinese saying
<br>
(I believe) along the lines of &quot;If you do not change the direction in which you
<br>
are going, you are likely to end up where you are headed&quot;.
<br>
<p>One only has to read the history of Russia for much of the 20th century to
<br>
understand (in bloody red detail) what that looks like.
