<p>I do, of course, but I am a libertarian.  I've remained silent on this
<br>
issue of late mainly because the discussion makes more heat than light
<br>
and I don't see anyone changing positions based on it.  Instead, people
<br>
are basically reciting their views.
<br>
<p>BTW, I visit <a href="http://www.vdare.com/">http://www.vdare.com/</a> ,  lewrockwell.com, and antiwar.com
<br>
regularly.  They're good sites to get the libertarian,
<br>
paleoconservative, and paleolibertarian viewpoints on various issues.
<br>
(I urge people to visit them, but, like with anything else, not to only
<br>
visit them.)
<br>
<p>Later!

<p>&quot;A written constitution certainly has many and considerable advantages,
<br>
but it is a great mistake to suppose that the mere insertion of
<br>
provisions to restrict and limit the power of the government, without
<br>
investing those for whose protection they are inserted with the means of
<br>
enforcing their observance will be sufficient to prevent the major and
<br>
dominant party from abusing its powers.  Being the party in possession
<br>
of the government, they will, from the same constitution of man which
<br>
makes government necessary to protect society, be in favour of the
<br>
powers granted by the constitution and opposed to the restrictions
<br>
intended to limit them...&quot; -- John C. Calhoun
