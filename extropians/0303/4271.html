<p>It's not necessary to believe.
<br>
<p>This +157/-0 means (I think) that Harvey has had
<br>
posts in the archives opened 157 times, and has never
<br>
started a thread to which no one responded.  This would
<br>
not surprise me, for there are about a dozen extroposters
<br>
one might look up in the archives if one had not the
<br>
time to read all the posts.  You probably know
<br>
approximately who they are, I needn't name names.
<br>
<p>A quick examination shows that most extropians have
<br>
negative karma.
<br>
<p>I have an idea which might improve the karma sitch.
<br>
First of all, we should change the name of karma to
<br>
something neutral.  I asked four people today at the
<br>
office if they knew the definition of the term karma.
<br>
They waved their arms and said things like: &quot;Karma is...
<br>
like...sort of...  I dont know.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then I asked them if karma is good, bad or neutral.
<br>
All said it was good.
<br>
<p>By extention, negative karma is bad.  I suggest that
<br>
parameter be renamed &quot;fleem&quot; so that it is not clear
<br>
if one would want more or less of it.  Secondly, there
<br>
is no need for the negative sign, since the second
<br>
number is always zero or negative.  Thirdly, remove
<br>
the slash sign, which can be interpreted as a divide,
<br>
which makes *everyone's* karma negative.  Replace the
<br>
/ with a # so that it does not encourage anyone to
<br>
try to artificially inflate one's karma by writing a
<br>
gawkbot, or by opening one's own posts from the archives
<br>
or by writing subject lines that are designed to encourage
<br>
the curious to open the message, such as &quot;extropian
<br>
nudist colony&quot; ext.
<br>
<p>The fleem parameter would prevent the mistake many of
<br>
us made yesterday, assuming karma had something to do
<br>
with whuffie.  Furthermore, fleem may have its value in
<br>
studying what things interest the collective extropian
<br>
metamind.
