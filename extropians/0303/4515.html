<p><p>&quot;Introduction
<br>
In February 2003, the Center for Public Integrity obtained an
<br>
apparent draft of &quot;PATRIOT II&quot; legislation. The draft, dated January
<br>
9, 2003, contained an analysis and the proposed text of the
<br>
&quot;Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003.&quot;
<br>
<p>The draft touches on a number of areas of law, including
<br>
wiretapping, law enforcement access to business records, freedom of
<br>
information, search and seizure, encryption policy, and immigration
<br>
law.
<br>
<p>When the language was leaked, the DOJ immediately issued a press
<br>
release minimizing the importance of the draft. However, the draft
<br>
indicates that DOJ intends to continue to increase executive police
<br>
power while either limiting or eliminating congressional or judicial
<br>
oversight.&quot;
<br>

<p>The EPIC site provides a huge number of documents. I encourage
<br>
people here to read them. For example:

<br>
Civil Action No. 02-2077 (D.D.C.)
<br>
<p>EPIC, joined by the American Civil Liberties Union and
<br>
library and booksellers' organizations, filed suit on October
<br>
24, 2002, under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) seeking
<br>
the disclosure of information concerning implementation of
<br>
the controversial USA PATRIOT Act. The lawsuit covers some of
<br>
the information the Justice Department withheld from the
<br>
House Judiciary Committee in response to a set of detailed
<br>
questions.

<br>
<p>Talking Points I: Domestic Security Enhancement Act of 2003
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(&quot;Patriot II&quot;)
<br>
<p>The USA PATRIOT Act was signed into law on Oct. 26, 2001. For
<br>
months, Congressional legislative and committee staff have
<br>
anticipated follow-up legislation. The Administration consistently
<br>
indicated that, although many ideas were being considered, specific
<br>
proposals weren't ready to be shared with Congress.  However, on
<br>
Friday, Feb. 7, 2003, the non-partisan Center for Public Integrity
<br>
(CPI) posted on its website a copy of a confidential draft of
<br>
proposed legislation dated Jan. 9, 2003, entitled the &quot;Domestic
<br>
Security Enhancement Act of 2003,&quot; together with a &quot;control sheet&quot;
<br>
which appears to show that the confidential draft had been
<br>
transmitted on Jan. 10, 2003, to House Speaker Hastert (IL) and
<br>
Vice-President Cheney (presumably in his capacity as President of
<br>
the Senate). Availability of the document was publicized by Bill
<br>
Moyers on his Feb. 7, 2003, PBS TV program, &quot;Now with Bill Moyers,&quot;
<br>
when Mr. Moyers interviewed Charles Lewis, the head of CPI. The
<br>
Justice Department did not dispute the authenticity of the draft,
<br>
although it denied that Rep. Hastert or Vice-Pres. Cheney had been
<br>
sent the document.
<br>
<p>The proposed law would radically expand law enforcement and
<br>
intelligence gathering authority; reduce or eliminate judicial
<br>
oversight over certain surveillance; authorize secret arrests,
<br>
detentions, and grand jury subpoenas; create a DNA database of
<br>
individuals who are suspected of association with terrorism or
<br>
terrorist groups; create new death penalty provisions; and empower
<br>
the government to remove American citizenship from persons who
<br>
belong to or support disfavored political groups.
<br>
<p>Some highlights of the proposed act:
<br>
<p>Increases secret surveillance.  The proposed act would create broad
<br>
new powers of surveillance by the Administration, broadening the
<br>
definitions of who can be secretly watched, the certification that
<br>
the Administration must make to receive a warrant, and the
<br>
circumstances in which the Administration can conduct surveillance
<br>
without a warrant. It would terminate or alter consent decrees set
<br>
up to curb illegal surveillance by local law enforcement
<br>
authorities.
<br>
<p>Increases control over immigrants.  The proposed act would expand
<br>
the control of the Justice Department over immigration matters,
<br>
including expedited deportation. It would criminalize many
<br>
regulatory violations and remove judicial discretion from some
<br>
immigration rulings.
<br>
<p>Establishes new crimes, criminal procedures, and sanctions.  The
<br>
proposed act would create new crimes, criminal procedures, and
<br>
punishments relating to non-violent activities that could be linked
<br>
to terrorism or groups deemed to be &quot;terrorist groups&quot; by the
<br>
Administration. It would give the Justice Department new powers
<br>
concerning certification of evidence, submission of secret evidence,
<br>
and mandatory pretrial detention. It would permit surveillance of
<br>
the content of home computers and multi-use handheld devices, and
<br>
would permit surveillance of banking and credit accounts. It would
<br>
expand the Justice Department's subpoena power to include
<br>
&quot;administrative subpoenas,&quot; issued without judicial oversight. It
<br>
would increase the government's control over banking activities and
<br>
further enhance money laundering provisions. It would make even
<br>
standard encryption of Internet and e-mail messages an enhancement
<br>
to other felonies.
<br>
<p>Names new death penalty crimes.  The proposed law would provide for
<br>
imposition of the death penalty for certain terrorism-related
<br>
crimes.
<br>
<p>Grants right to autopsy.  The proposed act would give federal
<br>
officials power to order an autopsy without permission during a
<br>
federal criminal investigation if the death occurred from terrorist
<br>
attack or &quot;other deadly crimes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Decreases access to public information.  The proposed act would
<br>
restrict public Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) access to public
<br>
information about those detained during terrorism investigations. It
<br>
would restrict available public information about potential
<br>
pollution by private chemical businesses, curtailing environmental
<br>
and local government oversight. The proposed act would also prohibit
<br>
disclosure of information by witnesses and others subpoenaed in
<br>
terrorism cases, transforming these investigations from public to
<br>
secret.
<br>
<p>Establishes a new terrorist-related DNA database.  The proposed act
<br>
would create a DNA database under Justice Department control. Anyone
<br>
the Administration suspects of association with terrorism would be
<br>
forced to contribute DNA samples. Any &quot;reasonably necessary&quot; means
<br>
could be used to get the samples, and failure to comply would bear
<br>
criminal penalties. The DNA database information could be shared
<br>
with state and local law enforcement agencies.
<br>
<p>Alters procedure for taking away U.S. citizenship.  The proposed act
<br>
would allow the government to strip a citizen of his or her
<br>
citizenship by government inference of intent to relinquish
<br>
citizenship, inference rising from behavior including fighting with
<br>
a hostile foreign government or terrorist organization, or even
<br>
engaging in lawful activities of a group designated as a &quot;terrorist
<br>
organization&quot; by the Attorney General.
<br>
<p>Allows extradition without treaty and expanded deportation.  The
<br>
proposed act would permit extradition of individuals to countries
<br>
with whom the U.S. has no extradition treaty. It would permit
<br>
deportation to any location deemed acceptable by the Attorney
<br>
General if deportation to the country of origin is &quot;impracticable,
<br>
inadvisable, or impossible,&quot; even if the destination's government is
<br>
not recognized by the U.S. or it has no government at all.
<br>
<p>The proposed act is laced with interactions between federal law
<br>
enforcement activities and foreign intelligence activities. It would
<br>
further intermingle traditionally separated federal, state, and
<br>
local law enforcement agencies. The proposed act completely
<br>
by-passes the Homeland Security Department, new home to the
<br>
Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) and numerous crime and
<br>
foreign intelligence operations. In addition, the provisions of this
<br>
proposed act would represent a fundamental change from the
<br>
Constitutional framework of separation of powers of the branches of
<br>
government, to delegating power to the Administration without
<br>
oversight or accountability. It would further decrease information
<br>
about government functions to the public. The proposed act would
<br>
remove numerous protective walls between government agencies,
<br>
erected by statute and regulation to correct past abuses.
