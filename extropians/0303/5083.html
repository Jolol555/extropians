&quot;That's basically irrelevant.  This is a war of aggression, and is 
<br>
therefore wrong.&quot;
<br>
<p>To get to the main point of  Lee's post, Charles, I would be curious to know 
<br>
that in addition to opposing this war, do you also protest it publicly? 
<br>
Additionally, I would be curious to know if you if you organized or 
<br>
participated in any protests either here or abroad of the Soviets invasion of 
<br>
Afghanistan in 1979.  If not, then perhaps North Vietnam's invasion of the 
<br>
South in March 1972? How about France's unilateral decision to remove Emperor 
<br>
Jean Bedel Bokassa  from the Central African Empire in 1979?
<br>
<p>If the answer is no, then you do not diminish Lee's main argument that these 
<br>
&quot;anti-war&quot; and even worse &quot;peace&quot; (whatever that fanciful concept means to a 
<br>
million different people) protesters ONLY criticize US intervention abroad.  
<br>
And these protesters do this despite the fact that said interventions, like 
<br>
the US's in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Korea, have the potential to significantly 
<br>
better the quality of life for the people in those countries, unlike most of 
<br>
the examples I just mentioned. Where were the protests against Soviet 
<br>
brutality? Saddam's? The North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao's? Protests against 
<br>
anyone who is not the &quot;evil&quot; United States?
<br>
<p>&quot;That it's being sold as something else basically 
<br>
demonstrates the power of the press.  It's not the first time.  Hearst 
<br>
organized the Spanish-American war to sell more newspapers.&quot;
<br>
<p>Are you going to seriously argue that the Iraqi people will not benefit from 
<br>
the removal of Saddam Hussein? But you're absolutely correct on one point. 
<br>
The press has willingly misled the public regarding wars in the past. Such as 
<br>
when Walter Cronkite on February 27, 1968, in the wake of the Tet Offensive, 
<br>
absurdly opined that the North Vietnamese &quot;can match our every escalation.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;If you want to assert that Hussein is (or was) evil, I will agree.  But 
<br>
he wasn't as evil as having bombs dropped on your head, as having your 
<br>
water supplies destroyed (in the desert!).  Etc.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me address this on two points. First, you are being intellectually 
<br>
dishonest if you are in any way suggesting that the United States is 
<br>
intentionally attempting to inflict mass casualties on the Iraqi people. They 
<br>
are taking great pains to do avoid that, at the cost of putting our own men 
<br>
in further jeopardy. This has always been a feature of US military 
<br>
involvement abroad. We could have easily won the Indochina War by flooding 
<br>
the North Vietnamese dikes thus killing millions of them, or by using low 
<br>
yield tactical nuclear weapons against them. However, our &quot;evil&quot; government 
<br>
chose not to do these things, a fact that I don't think can be seriously 
<br>
argued if the situations were reversed and our adversaries, such as Saddam,  
<br>
possessed those capabilities. 
<br>
<p><p>And please correct me if I'm wrong Charles, but if you accept that Hussein 
<br>
&quot;is (or was) evil&quot; then you must then accept the conservative estimates that 
<br>
he is responsible for the deaths of at least 200,000 of his own people. If 
<br>
this is not so, then please enlighten us as to what you do find to be 
<br>
Hussein's &quot;evil&quot;, so that we might discuss the merits of our positions. But 
<br>
let me assume for now that you do in fact agree that Hussein is a mass 
<br>
murdering thug. I think it a safe assumption that civilian casualties in Iraq 
<br>
will not reach &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; as argued by many, such as 
<br>
anti-war.com, just as they did not reach epic proportions in Afghanistan 
<br>
despite what the anti-war lobby argued then as well.
<br>
<p>That being said, in the long run, more lives will be saved through our &quot;war 
<br>
of aggression&quot; than by allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power. Not to 
<br>
mention the fact that the quality of life of the people of Iraq will be 
<br>
improved, just as &quot;amazingly&quot; happens almost every time the United States 
<br>
intervenes abroad. I think we all recall the South Koreans, Greeks, Japanese, 
<br>
West Germans, and Afghans, among others, no?
<br>
<p>&quot;I have heard it reported that the CIA assessment was that Hussein was no 
<br>
threat as long as he wasn't invaded.&quot;
<br>
<p>And I &quot;have heard it reported&quot; that people in West Virginia were abducted by 
<br>
aliens. All joking aside, please be kind enough to provide some documentation 
<br>
of this assertion for us.
<br>
<p>&quot;That sort of cuts the legs out of 
<br>
even the faint justifications of the people who claimed that fear that 
<br>
someone might attack them was sufficient reason to attack first.  (And 
<br>
if it is sufficient justification, just consider where that puts the US 
<br>
now.  Now that it has initiated an unprovoked war of aggression.)&quot;
<br>
<p>I would simply ask what your justification would be for removing Saddam 
<br>
Hussein, since apparently our own defense and improving the quality of life 
<br>
of the Iraqis are not sufficient in your view. And again, I hope that I will 
<br>
see you consistently bash the French as &quot;hypocrites&quot; in the future, given 
<br>
that they opted to remove a brutal regime that was of absolutely no threat to 
<br>
them. Indeed, I see absolutely no differences between Saddam and Bokassa's 
<br>
regimes beyond the fact that it is Saddam Hussein who has and continues to 
<br>
actively pursue weapons of mass destruction. Additionally, Mr. Hussein has 
<br>
already invaded one of his neighbors, something that Bokassa was never in a 
<br>
position to do even had he wanted to expand the Central African &quot;Empire.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ever vigilant for signs of further French wars of aggression,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
