<p>You comment \&quot;so much\&quot; is a non-sequitor.
<br>
<p><p>Actually, it is spelled 'non-sequitur', but that is another issue.
<br>
<p>Doug is entirely right to say what he does, sequitur or non-sequitur. Turkey
<br>
has invaded Iraq three times in the last decade with no protest in the
<br>
Security Council, no hand waving and squawking by the French, the Germans,
<br>
or the Russians. Turkey never sought a resolution in the UN to support its
<br>
actions, either, so if our action is a violation of international law, then
<br>
Turkey is three times worse, yet I see no condemnation from the likes of you.
<br>
<p>Is it that it so plainly exposes the sophistry of your arguments as the failed
<br>
bleatings of a newsgroup lawyer?
<br>
<p><p>The security council can only make resolutions when none of the five permanent
<br>
members exercises their veto. And the Security Council doesn't always get
<br>
involved.
<br>
<p><p>Why the heck not, Bret??? That is, according to you and your cronies, EXACTLY
<br>
what the Security Council is supposed to prevent, according to your voluminous
<br>
quotations of the UN Charter.
<br>
<p>Why? Perhaps because Turkey is a nearly third world, muslim nation, and we
<br>
are the US, the predominant power in the world, militarily and economically,
<br>
and there are spiteful, jealous, resentful has-been countries like France and
<br>
Germany who would use any opportunity to stick us?
<br>
<p>Perhaps because Turkey invaded from the north, nowhere near the oil fields
<br>
where French oil companies operated, while our invasion route is through the
<br>
heart of French operated Iraqi oil territory?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It never functioned in the first place.  I guess if Turkey can invade Iraq 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willy-nilly, why not the US?                                                
</em><br>
<p>Please stop guessing its wasteful of time. I will be pleased to discuss the UN
<br>
Charter or the matters in this thread with those who are making a bona fide
<br>
effort to understand, but please, do make some effort don't just lead with
<br>
complete ignorance.
<br>
<p><p>i.e. Don't confuse Bret with the facts, his mind is made up. Pointing out his
<br>
errors only serves to get his dander up in a ruff and his skirts bunched up.
