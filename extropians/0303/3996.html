<em>&gt;### This is a very interesting line of thought that I have been recently

<em>&gt;knowledge embodied in a physical object) was really able to protect his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;property while allowing wide access to it, but without having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state-enforced monopoly, this might be actually better than the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt;situation. Persons unwilling to accept the terms set out by the owner would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be free to compete by coming up with comparable information on their own,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which would provide incentives to produce useful information, identical to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the incentives in the production of other commodities. Still, not knowing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;enough about technology, I wonder if it would be really possible to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information ownership rights without some significant restrictions on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;devices used for the transmission and reading of information. How does
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Palladium work?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is the key question.  Palladium won't exist in a vacuum.  It's 
<br>
ability to work will depend on new and improved laws, e.g., laws making 
<br>
it illegal to modify hardware to circumvent it.  And it will be largely 
<br>
designed by a company that has repeatedly shown a contempt for it's 
<br>
customers, ethics, and decency.  And that frequently lies about it's 
<br>
products, not only before release, but afterwards.  So it's going to be 
<br>
a new kind of state enforced monopoly, not get away from that concept.  
<br>
(Getting away from the concept would be worthy, but no state will give 
<br>
up controls on any monopolies that exist.  The best you can hope for is 
<br>
that it might make it difficult to create new ones.  The state is 
<br>
practically defined as an organization that claims a monopoly on the use 
<br>
of force.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I fully agree with the initial part of your analysis, since an appropriately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;managed patent and copyright system IMO indeed reduces transaction costs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;allows the provision of useful goods which would otherwise not be provided.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This is correct, but the presumption &quot;...appropriately managed...&quot; 
<br>
assumes that those managing it have the same criteria as you do as to 
<br>
what this constitutes.  For some people the current US patent system is 
<br>
&quot;appropriately managed&quot;.  And those people are the ones in control of 
<br>
the operation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The existence of the legal infrastructure of courts (whether private or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;state run), capable of enforcing impartial decisions regarding private
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contracts at will, is a prerequisite for a lot of business activity, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;.... copyright law, essentially a perpetuity, is a total
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mess, which frequently happens with systems amenable to political
</em><br>
<em>&gt;manipulation against rational market forces.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rafal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Agreed.  It's vile.  But even so it isn't as bad as the current patent 
<br>
system.
