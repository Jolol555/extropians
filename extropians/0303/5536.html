<p><em>&gt; So let me get this straight--you want people to speak freely, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if that speech happens to be an honest and polite request for restraint,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then it's a despicable attempt at control?  Right, got it.
</em><br>
<p>When Greg posted his request of calming down the war debate I already had a
<br>
contribution written with the goal of establishing a news service for
<br>
American patriots with informnation they do not get on CNN or FOX.
<br>
<p>My strategy was to completetly withdraw from the war debate and to &quot;publish&quot;
<br>
this news service as long as the war lasts. To me my writings sounded good
<br>
natured and humorous, but I still knew that irony and satire might inflame
<br>
war supporters in this delicate debate. So I restrained from posting it. But
<br>
I get this uneasy feeling that Greg's request is establishing the scissors
<br>
of self censorship in my brain.
<br>
<p>Talking and writing about visceral - here I mean anatomic truths - reactions
<br>
to the US war lords appears to be a violation of good taste to some people
<br>
who cold-bloodedly accept suffering and death on both sides. To me it is
<br>
clearly this behaviour, this indignation about dirty words that shows the
<br>
whole perversion. Puking - dirty, dirty! - is suddenly labeled as bad taste
<br>
and the lowest level of communication. Maybe it is really a cultural gap
<br>
between the US and Europe, but I grew up with literature and art that
<br>
deliberately and elaborately gets to visceral - this time of course
<br>
physically *and* metaphorically - descriptions that offer blatant images.
<br>
<p>Okay, all I ask for, Greg, is: please do not establish the scissors of self
<br>
censorship in our brains. I will gladly label my postings as contributions
<br>
that will not attack *members of  this list* because of their pro war
<br>
feeling but mails that might contain rude and dirty words in the eyes and
<br>
ears of those who are pro war. All people have to do is put my name
<br>
in their kill files or delete my postings.
