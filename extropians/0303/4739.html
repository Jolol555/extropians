<p><em>&gt; I've done some thinking..., one idea being providing web 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; access (allowing for individual blogs) to some hungry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; third world village which would then be 'adopted' by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classroom in the U.S.  The villagers could blog details
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their environment, plus things like mailing soil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; samples for analysis, etc, and the challenge to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classroom is how much they can improve [sic] villager
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life via all or mostly information.
</em><br>
<p>That's a great idea!  I can't think of anything to teach
<br>
humility to the American students as quickly as that!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Basically, the individual villagers blog their individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs and desires into blogs which are aggregated by the class.
</em><br>
<p>Aggregate need!  Wonderful.  Someone should tell Paul
<br>
Samuelson so that he can incorporate this new concept
<br>
into his worthless books.  (sorry for the sarcasm in
<br>
this paragraph)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I could see even elementary classrooms participating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in this, perhaps interacting with the villager kids,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or data entry.
</em><br>
<p>What they would learn is one of life's most important
<br>
lessons, to wit, ***Eternal Truth Number One***:  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing is Simple
<br>
<p>What sounds easier than the students applying their
<br>
Western wisdom to the down-trodden in the poorer areas
<br>
of the world?  What sounds simpler?  They would, of
<br>
course, discover that it's not so simple, and that
<br>
the &quot;natives&quot; have a vastly better understanding of
<br>
their own situation and what can be done that do the
<br>
ignorant foreign students.
<br>
<p>I mean, if helping the poorer countries has escaped the
<br>
best minds in the IMF and World Bank, and their trillions,
<br>
for decade after decade after decade, I hate to break it
<br>
to you, but the students are going to find that there is
<br>
absolutely nothing they can do.  It would be a miracle if
<br>
they came to understand the &quot;natives&quot; situation one tenth
<br>
as well as those benighted souls.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are significant barriers here, especially language, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably most conversation would be mediated by automated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; translation systems.  Villagers might be hesitant to discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personal needs and desires and that would perhaps take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; significant time and repeated friendly (and non-judgmental)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interaction to overcome.
</em><br>
<p>The villagers might also be reluctant to disabuse the American
<br>
children of their fantasies.  A non-public remark of one villager
<br>
to another might be, &quot;I understand that we are putting up with
<br>
this silliness because somebody over there might send some
<br>
money, but shouldn't we be honest with the poor kids?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The kids would get some benefit of being like consultants,
</em><br>
<p>That's what American kids need these days!  More self-esteem!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; outside the politics and social structures of the villagers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thereby build trust to offer objective advice.
</em><br>
<p>This wouldn't be at all dangerous; the wise villagers would
<br>
know exactly what to do with the children's advice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whatever the benefits to the village, the benefits to the class could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enormous. All education would be geared toward solving real-world goals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in real-time.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, but it's really difficult to believe that you 
<br>
are being serious here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps some social science subjects would be shifted to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower grades, as they might, for example, research history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to prepare summaries for the higher grades who turn these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into direct recommendations.
</em><br>
<p>Humor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An example might be 'find ways similar tribal conflicts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been resolved before' etc.
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  And with the skills the kids develop, they can
<br>
man the hotlines to resolve domestic disturbances,
<br>
intractable corporate mergers, and any number of
<br>
conflicts that periodically arise between groups
<br>
and individuals.  (Why isn't there an emoticon for
<br>
sarcasm?)
<br>
<p>Why, they could even intercede on the Extropians list
<br>
to soothe troubles arising between groups calling
<br>
each other &quot;trolls&quot; and other names, and troubles
<br>
that arise from certain overly cynical and sarcastic
<br>
persons sticking it occasionally to other posters.
