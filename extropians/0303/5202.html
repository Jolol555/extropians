<p>Humble observation follows.
<br>
<p>I suspect that a great many hardy, smart people are not extropically SARS- 
<br>
cautious day-to-day. I include myself, though I seek to change that.
<br>
<p>The drill: wash (*SCRUB*, like a surgeon) your hands more, carry and use 
<br>
alcohol wipes or one of the newer alcohol-containing evaporating goops 
<br>
(especially on pay phones if you have to use them); try to break any habits 
<br>
of touching your face, mouth, eyes and hair when you are out and haven't 
<br>
washed up recently.
<br>
<p>Me, I just bought some of the goop and need to transfer some of it to a 
<br>
small squeeze bottle to carry whenever I'm out. One dime-sized dab per 
<br>
application is what they say. That, and a good small $2.00 fingernail scrub 
<br>
brush, are now part of my kit.
<br>
<p>This regimen is projected by some health sources to reduce the risk of 
<br>
simple rhinovirus infection by something like 70% or more. Maybe they're 
<br>
right. One of the candidate organisms for SARS is mighty like a rhinovirus. 
<br>
Verb. sap.; makes more sense than a gas mask to Yours Truly.
<br>
<p>Apologies if I'm over my 8 for the day.
<br>
<p>MMB
