</em><br>
<p>Perhaps. But I think I did get it. What I did not do, was exerpt, all
<br>
the parts of your post which caused me to ask the above questions
<br>
and so it seems that you haven't understood why I asked what I did.
<br>
<p>In that same post that the above excerpt is from you state.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If a nation is democratic, and lives by a majoritarian tyranny 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; system of government (as France is), it's leaders are acting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; EXACTLY as their constituents want them to.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The USA is ALSO a democracy (at least, in the sense that you
<br>
seem to be using it when you are referring to France). I therefore 
<br>
wondered if you applied your notion to yourself as citizen of the US,
<br>
hence my question:
<br>
<p>&quot;Does the government own your judgement on all matters because 
<br>
there was an election some time ago?&quot;
<br>
<p>I was pretty sure I knew what the answer was, I still am. 
<br>
<p>The other question I asked because you seemed to be presuming
<br>
rather a lot on the basis of a poll that you did not cite. You used the
<br>
term &quot;we&quot;.
<br>
<p>So I asked &quot;When you say &quot;we&quot; and presume to speak for a group
<br>
how many proxies are you actually holding?&quot; I think it is a common 
<br>
mistake, especially in emotionally charged discussions, for people to
<br>
get excited and to presume they are speaking for more people than
<br>
they are. Sometimes spokespersons do speak quite legitimately for
<br>
more than themselves but sometimes some people just presume to
<br>
speak for other people and they are not actually authorised to do so.
<br>
<p>Also the use of the  word &quot;we&quot; when the referent group is unclear is
<br>
also quite confusing in some cases. On this list to say &quot;we&quot; might
<br>
mean you and I. It might mean &quot;we&quot; (extropians). It might mean 
<br>
&quot;we&quot; Americans. What is actually meant by &quot;we&quot; is often genuinely
<br>
unclear. 
<br>
<p>BTW: You have quite rightly pointed out that I made some spelling
<br>
mistakes. This is completely fair comment on your part and I will
<br>
try to do better. I do have spell checking turned on but it doesn't
<br>
pick up bad grammar etc. (I am a poor &quot;speller&quot; and I will try to
<br>
improve).
<br>
<p>I think clear communication is important Mike. Obviously so do
<br>
you. 
<br>
<p>Thank you
<br>
