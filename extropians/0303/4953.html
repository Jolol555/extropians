<em>&gt; &gt; Obviously, the core aspect is one nation or state ruling over

<em>&gt; &gt; territory not its own original territory and (the really important

<em>&gt; [Ron and I asked &quot;What is 'liberal imperialism'?&quot;]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Liberal imperialism&quot; is originally a term used by historians to
</em><br>
describe
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the kind of 'New Imperialism' that appeared after the Berlin Conference
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1878, to some extent in reality, much more in theory. By extension it
</em><br>
means
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a policy motivated or justified by the same kinds of ideas.  That is,
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; notion that imperialism is not about simply conquering other peoples for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wealth, power, or glory.  It is about advanced or civilised nations
</em><br>
ruling
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over other (not so advanced) nations so as to bring them the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; law, modernity...
</em><br>
Lee responds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet in all the cases I can think of from 1878 on, European powers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruled over others' lands for the primary purpose of enriching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves (i.e. economic advance), or for military gain (e.g.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the conquest of the Turkish possessions).  I would be willing to admit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a secondary consideration might be the welfare of the ruled,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least after, as you suggest, 1878.
</em><br>
<p>Not so. You have to make a distinction between practice and justificatory
<br>
theory (as I did en passant) and also between practice and motive. In other
<br>
words there is both Empire (the institutional/policy reality) and
<br>
Imperialism (the ideology that justifies the policy and inspires it). It is
<br>
simply not true that Europeans and people of European origin such as
<br>
Americans ruled over others for reasons of material gain. This was a motive
<br>
in the earlier phase of Empire in the 18th to early 19th century but is
<br>
mainly absent in the post 1878 period. Colonial empires lose money big time
<br>
and (contrary to the Hobson//Lenin view) there is not a substantial group
<br>
that gains economically at others expense. There are groups who gain
<br>
politically but that's another story. The main motives, as spelt out by the
<br>
advocates of Empire are (a) Glory (b) national power (c) the 'uplifting'
<br>
'civilising mission' as the French call it. This last is very important for
<br>
the great colonial administrators such as Cromer, Lyautey, and Lugard.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probably in the minds of the American leaders, benefit to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of Iraq is one of the motives, but probably no higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than about 3rd or 4th.
</em><br>
<p>I think it is actually higher than that but only inasmuch as it's an
<br>
inevitable element of a main motive - to realise a set of values and to
<br>
ensure American safety and predominance by doing this.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An important point is that you may not need to directly rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; over land/people de jure if your power is such that you effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; control it anyway e.g. British rule over about half of India plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; places like Argentina.  I'm afraid that while the US avoided that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; until the 1890s it caught a bad case after then, viz Hawaii, Puerto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Rico, the Philippines.  The policy followed in the Middle East
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; after [this new] war will tell us if it has embarked on another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; round of imperialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the irony is, the more effort that is made on behalf of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqi people, then the more imperialistic the U.S. role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will become!  For example, suppose (as I have just said) that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are two reasons that come before benefiting the Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.  For the purpose of discussion, let's assume that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are (i) ridding Iraq of WMD, (ii) stabilizing the price of oil.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then a possible (iii) establishing a non-authoritarian or less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repressive regime in Iraq  would require an extended stay by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Coalition (or at least U.S.) forces.  But the longer the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stay, the more this is a case of liberal imperialism.
</em><br>
<p>This is exactly right. As you say paradoxical. BTW the 'beneficiaries' of th
<br>
is policy are likely to resent it, even if they do actually benefit.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In other words to rule over other people for their own good,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with a kind of tutelary role.  Basically it's a Fabian welfare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; state but on an international level (one reason why most Fabians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were ardent Imperialists).  It seems to me that this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking is a major element in much argument about a war on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iraq, e.g. the idea that the US will reconstruct Iraq in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way it (allegedly) did in Germany and Japan after 1945.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The tutelary role the Fabians probably had in mind would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have extended indefinitely, no?  (After all, it was widely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed at the time that non-Western peoples couldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really rule themselves on our level.)
</em><br>
<p>No. If you read Fabians and other imperialists of that period they did
<br>
forsee the tutelary period ending at some time. Having said that it was
<br>
supposed to be a pretty distant prospect for some (e.g. black Africans)
<br>
while being much closer for others (e.g. West Indians, Egyptians). The
<br>
tricky case of course was India.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As for Germany and Japan, it's become clear that the occupying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; countries needed only &quot;flip a switch&quot;.  The Germans and Japanese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather easily converted into stalwart democracies.  We cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect most Middle Eastern countries to do so, not at least without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rather long period of &quot;tutelage&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I agree. That's why I think the kind of project being dreamed up by the
<br>
wilder neo-cons is insanely overambitious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The faction in Washington [Wolfowitz, etc.] are arguing, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I understand them, that the unique position of power the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; found itself in at the end of the Cold War gives it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opportunity and the responsibility to shape the world in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a way that both protects US interests and security and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advances certain political ideals.  Sounds a lot like liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; imperialism to me, could come straight out of late nineteenth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; century British imperialist writings of the Cecil Rhodes variety.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  As I said, the 19th century thinkers did *not* have any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intention of bringing up the White Man's burden to the White Man's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level now, did they?  I gather that the English really and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sincerely were trying to do this in India, but only, I think,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well into the 1920's.  Don't you think that if Rhodes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all actually wrote this that they didn't quite mean it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way that we would today?
</em><br>
<p>This *is* certainly what they said (although as I say they thought it would
<br>
take a very long time). Even if they thought it would be indefinite there is
<br>
a difference between thinking you are ruling over another people 'for their
<br>
own good' as opposed to because you have won a war and are more powerful
<br>
(the second view is actually less condescending than the first)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is very much where Tony Blair and his advisors are coming from.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So in your opinion, they're not in advance of the late 19th
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century imperialists?
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely - I think this is a case of brushing the dust off an old set of
<br>
arguments. There are several people here who make this case explicitly such
<br>
as Robert Cooper and John Lloyd. Also a recent TV series on the history of
<br>
the British Empire by Niall Ferguson argued the case for seeing the BE as
<br>
the great instrument of modernisation, with the not vey coded message that
<br>
something like it was needed now. (Remember Kipling's poem which you cited
<br>
was addressed to Americans and was a call for them to take over the imperial
<br>
role from the Brits)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Above you wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The policy followed in the Middle East after [this new] war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will tell us if it has embarked on another round of imperialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What are your criteria, more specifically?
</em><br>
<p>Pretty much what you pointed to earlier, plus policy towards the rest of the
<br>
region. I would say
<br>
<p>1. Length of stay - a flashing sign if it's clearly meant to be long
<br>
term/indefinite.
<br>
2. Signs that the authority exercisd by American officials is intended to
<br>
lead to a reconstruction of some basic social and political institutions.
<br>
3. Pressure put on other regimes in the region such as Syria, Iran, Egypt to
<br>
'mend their ways' and adopt more 'westernising' policies.
<br>
4. A very substantial military and administrative presence in the region.
<br>
<p>OTOH, if the US adopts a minimal approach of removing WMDs and the
<br>
Baathists, replacing them with clients (a Hashemite King perhaps?) and then
<br>
withdrawing most of it's military presence, and doesn't try to actually
<br>
administer or set policy for post Saddam Iraq, them Empire has got the
<br>
thumbs down. I suspect, having started the war, it will be difficult for the
<br>
administration to do this.
