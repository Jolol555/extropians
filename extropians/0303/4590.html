</em><br>
<p>I agree that direct military action against the US is unlikely at this
<br>
time, and over this issue (Iraq). But it could be something that other
<br>
governments start thinking about for the future. French, Russian, Chinese,
<br>
Pakistani, Iranian (?), etc. nuclear weapons are of course a kind of
<br>
bluff/trump card, but France/Germany (and their faction of the EU), China,
<br>
and even Russia could probably put together a formidable conventional
<br>
military force if their governments were so inclined. Ditto for Japan and
<br>
the young boom economies of East Asia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; THe only wild card would be if China decided to jump into an anti-US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war alliance.
</em><br>
<p>And now there is a new Chinese administration, so this is something to
<br>
watch. (The old administration is still influential in military affairs at
<br>
the moment, but that may change.)
<br>
There is another wild card - India, a potential superpower indeed, if not
<br>
already one. There are many reasons why the Indian government might wish
<br>
to ally itself with the US, but the US continues its Cold-War-relic
<br>
alliance with Pakistan, so India is liable to have to oppose the US also. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Face with such might, we wouldn't be alone. We'd have the UK,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australia, Japan, Spain, and a number of eastern european nations, plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we'd have a window of time before the anti-US forces could mobilize to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force a reformation of middle eastern governments along democratic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lines with pro-US parties in power. Heck, Canada might even get off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's tush.
</em><br>
<p>The UK might be splintered between the tidal forces of EU and
<br>
US. Australia has to take its near-Asian position into account, and its
<br>
relations with those neighboring countries - an alliance with the US might
<br>
or might not seem logical or advisable under the scenario of
<br>
re-allignments. Japan, ironically, is most likely to side with the US I
<br>
think, but then again, it might think it more timely to go back to
<br>
establishing a kind of &quot;co-prosperity sphere&quot; for itself among the new
<br>
Asian economies (competing with China independently of the US
<br>
alliance). Spain and other European countries might side with the US but
<br>
being so close to other possible alignments, they may not be able to hold
<br>
out very long under the circumstances of a conventional WWIII.
<br>
If, somehow, the US government had managed to &quot;export&quot; democratic-style
<br>
government to the Middle East before re-allignments, I think their
<br>
willingness to ally with the US would be very much in
<br>
question. Considering the considerable cultural antipathy to the US that
<br>
already exists among Middle Eastern peoples, they're very likely to side
<br>
with some other alliance - prob. the Germany/France one.
