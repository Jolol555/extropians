<em>&gt; &gt; the most questionable seems to be the assumption that copies don't matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so this line of reasoning turns me away from that belief.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree with you that &quot;copies don't matter&quot; probably isn't true.  Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything exists, if the number of copies doesn't matter, than nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters. What I reject is the idea that value is strictly proportional to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the global number of copies and with it the implication that you always do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good by re-running someone's pleasant experience.
</em><br>
<p>Value?  Value to whom?  I take it that in a volume of
<br>
spacetime under your control, an ensemble of Wei Dai
<br>
programs would experience variety.  That's your pleasure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what to replace this with?  How should copies matter?
</em><br>
<p>We replace *value* by *benefit* in our analysis.  It's clear
<br>
(or, at the rate we are making progress here, it soon will be)
<br>
that you experience twice the benefit if you have twice the
<br>
number of copies running in a given volume of spacetime.
<br>
<p>In 1990 or so, I published an article in The Immortalist
<br>
claiming as an axiom that benefit is additive over disjoint
<br>
volumes of spacetime, and even went through the perhaps
<br>
pointless exercise of specifying this in an equation (using
<br>
the principle of countable additivity from measure theory).
<br>
I need to dig that up.
<br>
<p>Following Hal's example, one notes that if X is a positive
<br>
experience such that a person will barely flip a coin the
<br>
yield of which is either X or -X (a negative experience
<br>
as bad as X is good), then four copies receiving X and
<br>
three copies receiving -X provides as much benefit as
<br>
one copy receiving X.
<br>
<p>(As for me, in my own value system, I've gone ahead and
<br>
equated value to benefit, except---just like in relativity
<br>
and quantum mechanics!---when we enter into either the very
<br>
small realms or the extremely vast.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How should copies matter?  This is the question that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think we'll be able to make much progress on until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we have a more general advance in moral philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, don't give up so soon!  8^D
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although we can speculate on possibilities.  Maybe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has something to do with distance?  Maybe the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies are diminished if they're close together in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space-time?
</em><br>
<p>I rather doubt it.  Suppose two brothers decide to enter
<br>
into a twin-paradox type scenario, and one lives on Earth
<br>
in his tight little religious colony, but then dies at 89.
<br>
The other gets on a starship and accelerates nearly to the
<br>
speed of light, travels in large circles, and sweeps by
<br>
the Earth every so often.  When he also dies at age 89
<br>
their lives obviously had comparable benefit (he had a
<br>
large number of co-religionists on board).
<br>
<p>So now suppose that two duplicates decide to experience only
<br>
one second per century, one stays on Earth, the other gets
<br>
his benefit only in 100 light year increments.  Whatever the
<br>
trajectory of the second one, no matter how many galaxies he
<br>
visits (and periodically sweeps back through the local 
<br>
vicinity), it seems artificial to suppose that there is some
<br>
difference in the total value of their lives (to you), even
<br>
though the distances between them become arbitrarily large
<br>
from time to time.
