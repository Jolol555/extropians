<p><em>&gt; Title: Philosophical Implications of Inflationary Cosmology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Authors: Joshua Knobe, Ken D. Olum, Alexander Vilenkin
</em><br>
<p>Thanks a million!  This is almost as good as Tegmark's.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I always thought that Olum and Vilenkin (never knew of Knobe) we sharp minds.
<br>
Tegmark, as a working cosmologist, was part of a team that has detected some 
<br>
&quot;pattern&quot; in the CMB, that were wholly unexpected. It could just be banding, 
<br>
of sorts, or it might possibly be evidence of &quot;organization.&quot; Check it out on 
<br>
the BBC News website for SCI-tech. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The central, compelling, and overwhelming fact:  the theory
<br>
of Inflation, accepted by roughly 95% of cosmologists, calmly
<br>
predicts an infinity of Earths of any given description.
<br>
<p>The philosophical implications are simply staggering.  No
<br>
longer can I be &quot;The Speaker for the Uninstantiated&quot;, as
<br>
I used to aspire.  I even must retract &quot;It is our duty to
<br>
rescue as many people from non-existence as possible&quot;,
<br>
which I have been claiming for fifteen years!
<br>
<p>Why?  Very simply because everyone already exists.  I had
<br>
been aware that this was an implication of MWI, and Hal
<br>
had even stated as much on this list a few months ago.
<br>
But an *interpretation* of QM, coupled with the &quot;ghostly&quot;
<br>
feel of the Other Worlds, combine to render the existence
<br>
of every possible person and alien moot.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Everyone may exist, but I would state that the challenge is, to be part of a 
<br>
civilization that creates and promotes 2-way communication with them all! 
<br>
This strikes me of an enhanced Dyson future. It is also impossible (for now) 
<br>
yet, if one measures how well human creativity has succeeded with telecom, in 
<br>
the last 180 years; there is some merit to suspecting that we, and our 
<br>
descendants (silicon-human-whatever) may continue to succeed in this 
<br>
endeavor.
