<p>Keith told me of the hot tub parties that went on.
<br>
I only met him about 5 years ago however, after all
<br>
of that was over.  He was already embroiled in his
<br>
battle against you-know-who.
<br>
<p>He never would come out and say it, but I fear Keith
<br>
thinks we Franced him on the CO$ war.  I was one of
<br>
those who gently urged restraint.  Alas, to no avail.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Have extro people in the Bay Area changed ? I suspect not...
</em><br>
<p>Well, perhaps not, but that struggle consumed Keith.
<br>
We were sympathetic with him, but when it came right
<br>
down to the critical moment, we failed to line up
<br>
behind him in combat formation.
