<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; So, here, most Iraqis must know that

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the coalition nations in an all out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; war, let alone all of them.  If to

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; or western imperialists, or whatever

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; association the may rightly or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrongly have, is the worst fate,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; then they logically must do anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they can to circumvent this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Anything&quot;?  You are putting forth the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interesting thesis that any act is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; justified in order to avoid losing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; war.  There are pluses to this view,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and minuses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nah, it depends on what losing [this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also the correct spelling of that slippery
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word, for the benefit of those admirable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who don't have English as their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; native tongue] the war means to the people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I'm not sure what you intend with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word &quot;justified&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I certainly was not claiming it [the Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position to be] right or just, but that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is what they must do to prevent losing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So again it routes back to what is to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost from the war.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  What will be the consequences of *losing*
<br>
is a big component all right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; On the plus side, should the U.S. have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subverted allegedly democratically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elected governments in order to thwart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the U.S.S.R.'s plans...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If the US did that, it may have won a battle,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but probably have lost them the war via PR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relations.
</em><br>
<p>Who really cares about that, if you succeed
<br>
in destroying a murderous, ruthless, and
<br>
horrifying regime like the U.S.S.R.?   Okay,
<br>
so the lefties scored a few points on the
<br>
campuses when the U.S. set up a pro-Western
<br>
Iran.  But the end result was that there is
<br>
no U.S.S.R. today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Therefore, I would suggest that if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; U.S., for example, captures an Al Qaeda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorist who knows where an atom bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in New York city is hidden, then torture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; him, I say, in order to learn where.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is undoubtedly true, and I imagine that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost anyone in such a position would do so.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But [battlefield conditions would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; different]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that and the US are after all the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invading.  Certainly at the very least,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they need to live up to a higher standard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to justify any actions they do.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, good point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OTOH, an Iraqi soldier capturing a US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soldier with just general strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, assuming said Iraqi intends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to defend his country, could easily view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; torturing information out as the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to stand a fighting chance. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, he may.  Or maybe he won't.  Or it
<br>
may depend.  What I would like you to do
<br>
is express approval or disapproval.  You
<br>
seem to be reluctant to do this, so I'll
<br>
ask some sharp questions:
<br>
<p>1. An Al Qaeda terrorist know where the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bomb is.  Torture him?
<br>
<p>(You said &quot;this is undoubtedly true&quot;
<br>
but failed to express your approval
<br>
or disapproval.)
<br>
<p>2. An ex-wife of an important Iraqi general
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is found to be living in New York under
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;an assumed name.  How far should the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. military go to extract information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that may help them win a key battle?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(Again---not what would be expected, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what you'd sanction.)
<br>
<p>3. Baghdad is about to fall, but a convoy
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;makes a wrong turn, and some cooks are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;captured by some very angry and hateful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Iraqi soldiers.  *Should* they torture
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him, given that they have seen countless
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;comrades cut down by American machine-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weapons, and have been hating Americans
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and non-Muslims their whole lives?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In effect, I'm asking what you would say
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to them, whether you would exhort them to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any course of action, and whether you 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;could back it up with reason integrated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;with a moral perspective you'll defend
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;here on the list.
<br>
<p>4. It's 1965 and Israeli agents have just
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;found a notorious war-criminal in South
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;America, and one of the Mossad agents
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had a brother tortured and killed by 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this same war criminal.  You are one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the other agents.  The choice of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;group is either to kill him or torture
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;him first before killing him (extradition
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not an option).  One of the other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;agents does not want to torture him first.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What should you do?  What should you be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in favor of your group doing?  What would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you say, and to whom?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All-out war has no rules. 
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  No one wanted to win more than the
<br>
Allies or the Germans in WWI but no one
<br>
used poison gas (though I admit that 
<br>
possibly there was strong self-interest
<br>
involved).  The Germans scrupulously
<br>
avoided bombing London in World War II
<br>
---it was against Hitler's policy to 
<br>
bomb civilians.  But a Luftwaffe plan
<br>
went off course one night---one plane
<br>
out of dozens---and dropped a very few
<br>
bombs on London doing very little
<br>
damage.  The English retaliated with a
<br>
quite large bombing run aimed exactly
<br>
at a German city, and that was the start
<br>
of WWII's frightful civilian death toll
<br>
from the air in both arenas of the war.
<br>
There had been rules in play, and the
<br>
British directly broke them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Now here are the acid questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (1) would you or would you not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     have any moral outrage against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     the U.S. were the Americans to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     do to enemy captives what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     apparently being done to theirs?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, before I can answer this, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would you rather have?
</em><br>
<p>Okay.  As you wish.  I am not shy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A few soldiers of your party captured and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured, or Washington routinely bombed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication broken off and surrounded so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that eventually if by some miracle the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invading force doesn't break through,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody will inevitably starve to death?
</em><br>
<p>I would rather have a few of my soldiers
<br>
tortured.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not that I don't understand *why*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the coalition would choose this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy in the war, but certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's not a fair fight to start with.
</em><br>
<p>Gasp!  Choke!  What do you think this
<br>
is, a game?  What do you want to see,
<br>
maybe the Russians come in on the Iraqi
<br>
side so that we get a really good show?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, yes I'd find moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outrage [for the U.S. torturing Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; captives taken in desert fighting] as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is utterly unnecessary and cruel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our case [for the U.S. to do so].
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; (2) Is there any act of perpetrated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     by the Iraqis against enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     combatants (or enemy nations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     e.g., an A-bomb in New York's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     harbor) that would elicit moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     outrage on your part?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly the A-bomb would,
</em><br>
<p>Good!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; although I'd keep in mind that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have NOT invaded and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't've happened, so perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the outrage would be directed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than one source.
</em><br>
<p>Oh good grief.  And so I suppose that
<br>
if the U.S. were to nuke Baghdad right
<br>
off the map with a 20-megatonner, you'd
<br>
have &quot;some&quot; moral outrage against the
<br>
U.S., but you'd also direct your outrage
<br>
at more than one source, say, Saddam
<br>
and Iraq?
<br>
<p>The lenses you're looking through seem
<br>
a little tilted to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; OTOH, if Baghdad was on the brink of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinction, (and I mean no question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they either do something drastic or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die, surrender not even an option)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a centralized group of troops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; located in Iraq were nuked, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly be a horrible thing,
</em><br>
<p>but, so long as it's the Americans
<br>
being nuked...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I can't be certain I'd be outraged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at them, as they were left with no other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you *do* always have a choice.  And
<br>
that's what I'd tell the understandably
<br>
upset Mossad agent in 1965.  You can still
<br>
choose to do the right thing!
<br>
<p>Now, take a look back at what is known
<br>
as &quot;the finest moment in American History&quot;.
<br>
Recall the unbelievably visceral hatred
<br>
that existed between Yank and Rebel.
<br>
At Appomatix courthouse in 1865, Robert E.
<br>
Lee sadly walked out of his surrender to
<br>
general Grant and addressed his troops.
<br>
<p>He could have said, &quot;We will fight in the
<br>
streets, we will fight in the hills, we
<br>
will NEVER surrender!&quot;  And if he had said
<br>
this, even unto this very moment pockets
<br>
of Rebels would be holed up in the hills
<br>
and swamps of the South.  But he did not
<br>
say this.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's all over, boys&quot;, said he.  And so it
<br>
was.
<br>
<p>Sometimes the right thing---that is, the
<br>
thing that you will approve of if you
<br>
reflect on it long enough and allow all
<br>
your knowledge and reason to come into
<br>
play---, sometimes the right thing is
<br>
to surrender.
<br>
<p>Lee
