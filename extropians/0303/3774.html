<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Out of the wreckage
<br>
<p>By tearing up the global rulebook, the US is in fact undermining its own 
<br>
imperial rule
<br>
<p>George Monbiot
<br>
Tuesday February 25, 2003
<br>
The Guardian
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>By wrecking the multilateral system for the sake of a few short-term, 
<br>
corporate interests, the US is, paradoxically, threatening its own 
<br>
tyrannical control of other nations. The existing international 
<br>
agencies, fashioned by means of brutal power politics at the end of the 
<br>
second world war, have permitted the US to develop its international 
<br>
commercial and political interests more effectively than it could have 
<br>
done alone.
<br>
<p>The institutions through which it has worked - the security council, the 
<br>
WTO, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank - have provided 
<br>
a semblance of legitimacy for what has become, in all but name, the 
<br>
construction of empire. The end of multilateralism would force the US, 
<br>
as it is already beginning to do, to drop this pretence and frankly 
<br>
admit to its imperial designs on the rest of the world. This admission, 
<br>
in turn, forces other nations to seek to resist it. Effective resistance 
<br>
would create the political space in which their citizens could begin to 
<br>
press for a new, more equitable multilateralism.
<br>
<p>There are several means of contesting the unilateral power of the US, 
<br>
but perhaps the most immediate and effective one is to accelerate its 
<br>
economic crisis. Already, strategists in China are suggesting that the 
<br>
yuan should replace the dollar as east Asia's reserve currency. Over the 
<br>
past year, as the Observer revealed on Sunday, the euro has started to 
<br>
challenge the dollar's position as the international means of payment 
<br>
for oil. The dollar's dominance of world trade, particularly the oil 
<br>
market, is all that permits the US Treasury to sustain the nation's 
<br>
massive deficit, as it can print inflation-free money for global 
<br>
circulation. If the global demand for dollars falls, the value of the 
<br>
currency will fall with it, and speculators will shift their assets into 
<br>
euros or yen or even yuan, with the result that the US economy will 
<br>
begin to totter.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>America's assertions of independence from the rest of the world force 
<br>
the rest of the world to assert its independence from America. They 
<br>
permit the people of the weaker nations to contemplate the global 
<br>
democratic revolution that is long overdue.
