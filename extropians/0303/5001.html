<em>&gt;This further supports Mike's statements, no amount of intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perserverence from guerilla tactic anarchists can defeat a massive statist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invasion with advanced weaponry and overwhelming firepower.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I did not see any attempt by him or you or others to look at what Dan and I
<br>
pointed links to regarding the definition of anarchocapitalism. I only saw
<br>
some bizarre references by Mike to who he thinks are 'anarchists'. The
<br>
Afghan comment was really the one that got me upset, though&quot;
<br>
<p>Your comments on Afghanastan were the focus of my attention.  I dont really
<br>
know if a anarcho capitalist defense is feasible against a statist
<br>
totalatarian invasion, but I found The Private Production of Defense by
<br>
Prof. Hans-Hermann Hoppe to be full of compelling arguments (as I said in an
<br>
earlier post to Samantha).  However, the events in Afghanastan seemed to
<br>
superficially support what Mike Lorrey was suggesting.
<br>
<p>Honestly, I dont care if such a system could adequately defend itself, since
<br>
we aint gonna see one any time soon.  Instead I am much more concerned about
<br>
the proliferation of terrorist organizations, the expansion of groups that
<br>
want nothing less than the destruction of western civilazation, technology,
<br>
progress, and freedom, and the reign of murderous oppresive regimes.
<br>
Hopefully one day I will feel it necessary to concern myself with the
<br>
functional capabilities of an anarcho capitalist system and its capabilities
<br>
for defense.  However, I note, the number of anarcho-socialists probably
<br>
exceeds the number of anarcho-capitalist 10 - 100x.
<br>
<p>&quot;If anyone is wondering why more enlightened topics not often-enough  make
<br>
into broad discussion on extropians, then here is one reason why.  For me,
<br>
it takes too much energy to talk about that here, fighting against
<br>
narrow-minded views and I see little interest with these people  to look
<br>
into it further and  study the sources.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think at one point in time, each of us has felt we could justifiable say
<br>
this about everyone else.  In this case I think your assessment of the
<br>
Soviet Afghan US situation was a gross oversimplification of what actually
<br>
occured there and why, which is why I felt compelled to respond.
<br>
<p>&quot;The title of the message is of course, referring to what the Afghan people
<br>
called the invasion of the Soviets in 1979. How many millions disappeared?
<br>
Nobody knows. By the crudest estimates, some 10 million Afghans by 1986 no
<br>
longer existed and a generation of Afghans mostly gone (dead, in prisons, in
<br>
refugee camps, escaped to the west). The largest population of refugees in
<br>
the 1980s were the Afghan population. The world was very silent during this
<br>
time. Please read some history and please talk to some Afghan refugees from
<br>
that time. There is no better source than the people who were actually
<br>
there.&quot;
<br>
<p>I could just as easily make the same suggestion to you, and probably feel as
<br>
justified about saying it as you do to me.  Perhaps my comment was a little
<br>
brash, but it is at the very least intellectually dishonest not to
<br>
acknolwedge the critical role that the US's assistance played in
<br>
Afghanastan.  Despite how I may come off on the list, I am not a cold
<br>
hearted impassionate callous hate monger.  I dearly empathize with the
<br>
attrocities that people face at the hands of murderous tyrannical
<br>
governments, which is why I am so vocal about telling the correct history of
<br>
Vietnam, where millions upon millions of people were enslaved or murdered.
<br>
<p>A quick search on the subject reveals
<br>
<p>&quot;By 1983, the CIA was purchasing assault rifles, grenade launchers, mines,
<br>
and SA-7 light antiaircraft weapons, totaling 10,000 tons, mainly from
<br>
China...in 1985, President Ronald Reagan made a secret decision to escalate
<br>
covert support to the mujahidin. Soon after, the CIA began to supply an
<br>
extensive array of intelligence, military expertise and advanced weapons to
<br>
the Muslim rebel forces...Furthermore, Reagan made the decision to equip the
<br>
mujahidin with sophisticated U.S.-made Stinger antiaircraft missiles. By
<br>
1987, the CIA was sending a steady supply of 65,000 tons of arms to the
<br>
mujahidin.  In all, the United States provided over $2 billion in weapons
<br>
and money to seven Islamic mujahidin factions in the 1980s, making this last
<br>
Cold War battle the largest covert action program since World War II&quot;
<br>

<br>
<p>and
<br>
&quot;This military aid mostly stemmed from the US, but China, Egypt, Israel, and
<br>
Saudi Arabia also funded the anti-Soviet efforts.  By 1985, military aid
<br>
reached an estimated $500 million, half of which came from the US; in 1986
<br>
the number doubled; and the total amount from the US for the years 1980-86
<br>
was around $625 million.  During the same period, an additional $400 million
<br>
from the US went to aid Afghan refugees.[8]&quot;
<br>
<p>from - <a href="http://www.seattlecentral.org/gedt/docs/afghans.html">http://www.seattlecentral.org/gedt/docs/afghans.html</a>
<br>
<p>Would these Afghan Refugees tell me all this equipement and weaponry was not
<br>
used?  Btw, I have never come across a Afghan refugee, but if I ever did I
<br>
would not miss an oppertunity to hear everything he/she has to say.
<br>
<p>A history note:
<br>
&quot;The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979. The Afghans fought them with
<br>
little help, surprisingly successively for a large part of that war.  Please
<br>
look to Soviet sources or talk to Russians for how difficult of a time the
<br>
Soviets were having. The U.S weapons to the Afghan fighters were not until
<br>
some 7 or 8 years later.  We all know how that turned out, don't we?&quot;
<br>
<p>As noted above, the invasion took place in 1979, the US was providing 10,000
<br>
tons of equipement *by* 1983, a mere 4 years later.  But assistance started
<br>
nearly immediately, with the US providing through China and Pakistan a much
<br>
needed quardaped gastrobot capable of carrying large loads over rough
<br>
terrain for great distances with little maintence.  The US supplied
<br>
thousands of these devices, also known as 'mules' to aide the mujahadeen in
<br>
1980.
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh yes, it's lovely to have two  superpowers using an innocent people for
<br>
their political goals.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes it is, unfortunately you seem in this statement ambivalent as to who the
<br>
oppresive murderous tryannical expansionist regime was that invaded
<br>
Afghanstan in the *FIRST* place.
