<em>&gt; BTW, A central government.. of any kind.. provides a big fat target
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Wrong. At the present time, it seems that Iraq has little central
<br>
government of any kind (alive, anyways, or able to communicate) yet is
<br>
very much in need of a defense against invasion by an external threat.
<br>
Consequently, the Iraqi infantryman is demonstrating his French
<br>
training and surrendering by the thousands... more than in the GW I,
<br>
the US troops say, and lots are Republican Guards this time.
<br>
<p>An ungoverned zone is a very tempting economic target for an organized
<br>
government (just the motivation of the New Mexicans in Vinge's
<br>
novella). Such a zone has high economic output which would outcompete
<br>
neighboring governed areas, yet would pay no taxes to support the
<br>
socialized infrastructure they would utilize in their trade with
<br>
governed areas. 
<br>
<p>Anybody who lives on the border between low tax and high tax states
<br>
sees this in demonstration every day. I do, living on the border of NH
<br>
and VT as I do. The NH side of the river is awash in shopping malls,
<br>
and Vermonters are primarily interested in getting to NH to conduct
<br>
business. I imagine that residents of the Tahoe area would see a
<br>
similar effect.
