<em>&gt; ====Mike, from your statements above and below, I feel that your mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a sin of omission.  Seriously you need to give me some more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence before I can side with you on this one.  From my view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've made a few statements about pacifism that don't match my own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition or what I would take as the standard definition. If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are creating a specialized definition then that should be noted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with some sort of asterisk in your &quot;sigfile&quot; and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other places where you make reference to the concept.  
</em><br>
<p>I am making no specialized definition. If you break the word down, it
<br>
signifies someone who is for peace. What sort of peace? There are many
<br>
kinds. There is the peace found in a prison camp, the peaceful streets
<br>
of a fascist society, and the peace found in being executed by a
<br>
oppressive government. 
<br>
<p>There is also the peace found in sitting on ones couch and doing
<br>
nothing when there is injustice in the world. There is the peace found
<br>
in isolating one's society from the rest of the world. There is the
<br>
peace of mind found in telling oneself, &quot;I've got my freedom, what do I
<br>
care if millions of people around the world have none?&quot; There is the
<br>
peace of mind found in refusing to believe that a fascist state
<br>
posesses weapons of mass destruction, in refusing to believe that
<br>
material evidence to support the opposition position is valid, or is
<br>
'enough' to demand the pacifist take action against it. These sorts of
<br>
pacifism are specifically sins of omission.
<br>
<p>There is also the pacifism of those who actively work against the
<br>
efforts of free people to fight against opressive regimes. Sean Penn,
<br>
for example, is such a pacifist. Jane Fonda is another. Chamberlain was
<br>
another, as was Charles Lindberg. Joseph Kennedy was another.
<br>
<p>The 'pacifists' who demonstrate against US and UK actions here in the
<br>
US, but do not protest in Iraq against Ba'ath Party actions on their
<br>
own people are similar sorts of pacifists, and it is these sorts that
<br>
Orwell was specifically speaking of, and which I am referring to in my
<br>
sigfile. Their actions are sins of commission. They value peace more
<br>
than liberty, the lives of fascists more than those of oppressed
<br>
civilians, and they are the racist ones in thinking that freedom for
<br>
other ethnic groups is not worth fighting for.
