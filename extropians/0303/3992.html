<p><em>&gt; This is a very interesting line of thought that I have been recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coming closer to. If the producer of a piece of information (be it music
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or knowledge embodied in a physical object) was really able to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his property while allowing wide access to it, but without having a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state-enforced monopoly, this might be actually better than the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation. Persons unwilling to accept the terms set out by the owner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be free to compete by coming up with comparable information on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own, which would provide incentives to produce useful information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical to the incentives in the production of other commodities. Still,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not knowing enough about technology, I wonder if it would be really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible to protect information ownership rights without some significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restrictions on the devices used for the transmission and reading of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. How does Palladium work?
</em><br>
<p>Basically Palladium attempts to let the computer user prove to a
<br>
remote computer what program he is running locally.  It achieves this
<br>
through a rather complex system involving cryptography, secure
<br>
hardware, and special extensions to the operating system.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the remote server will download some data to the user, but only
<br>
to a program which it knows will observe the Digital Rights Management
<br>
(DRM) rules built into that data.  The user can use Palladium to prove
<br>
to the remote system that he is running one of the programs which will
<br>
follow the DRM rules.  In this way the transfer can go forward on terms
<br>
which are mutually acceptable to both parties.
<br>
<p>Of course no system is perfect, and it remains to be seen how well
<br>
Palladium can implement this somewhat idealized model.
