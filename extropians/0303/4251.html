<p>First off, your explanation was wonderfully successful. I don't think 
<br>
I've ever grasped anything about economic theory quite as quickly 
<br>
ever. Didn't even have to read it twice.
<br>
<p>It reminds me of a the elegant simplicity  that Robert Heinlein had 
<br>
for property tax: You file the value of your property at the local 
<br>
town hall. You pay the property tax that is based on what you say 
<br>
your property is worth. At any time someone can buy the property at 
<br>
the price you named, and you have to accept the offer. Period. Well I 
<br>
probably mangled that but I'm sure someone will correct me.
<br>
<p>Anyhow, you've begged the question: No one wants to spend for 
<br>
defence, so little is spent on defense. The next war comes around and 
<br>
- oh wait, there isn't a war - the first exobrate that showed up with 
<br>
a sharpened pencil took over the country.
<br>
<p>Is this where some self-protection subroutines kick in?
