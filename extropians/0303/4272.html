Mike Lorrey explains
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just a few years ago, the wife of the President of the US, and her
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal cronies in and out of congress, had publicly labeled me and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of other law abiding Americans as terrorists and threats to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national security....
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't like the Patriot Act....[but] The only concerns I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about the Patriot Act are that it will survive the GOP hold on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the White House and the DNC will use it to launch an inquisition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against law abiding American citizens like myself who don't fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their politically correct view of the world.
</em><br>
<p>My left hemisphere thanks you.  If I can remember this
<br>
logic, what my intuitions and my emotions contribute
<br>
can be kept under control.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So forgetting about [the extreme loony left], who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; else thinks that there is a significant chance that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the U.S. will become as repressive as China currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is, or Spain under Franco was?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Depends on which party is in power.  The GOP can never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accomplish this, specifically because their members are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a minority in the US while Democrats are a majority.
</em><br>
<p>I did not copy the whole of your initial paragraph, where you
<br>
continued from &quot;Just a few years ago&quot; above.  In it you
<br>
shouted at the liberals on this list and elsewhere that
<br>
their inconsistency stank.  They had no trouble with Hillary
<br>
labeling as terrorists people like you.
<br>
<p>I deeply fear that these same people, right here on this list,
<br>
might be the very first to confiscate our freedoms were it
<br>
only done by the right people, and for the benefit of &quot;the
<br>
people&quot;.  This is because we all have our political blinders,
<br>
and can't see except when it's our ox that's being gored.
<br>
<p>But you have come out dead against the so-called Patriot Act,
<br>
proving that you are clinging tightly to the logic of the
<br>
issue, independent of which political party is in power, and
<br>
independent of who's being gored.
<br>
<p>As for me, in times of national peril, such as those we've 
<br>
been in since 9-11, I don't mind the freedoms of certain
<br>
minorities being compromised.  There, I've said it.
<br>
<p>For example, the internment of the Japanese during WWII was
<br>
the only prudent course of action, given the real presence
<br>
of sabotage outfits like the Black Dragon, and the real
<br>
human nature of certain disaffected people within any
<br>
demographic profile.  It wouldn't bother me a bit if tens
<br>
of thousands of Iraqis living in the U.S. were interned during
<br>
the coming short war, if coldly rational people in Washington
<br>
thought it would do good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Do you expect things to get worse and worse and worse?  Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foresee Ashcroft and those like him arresting people for political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dissent, censoring radio and television?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't think so. We've already had treasonous behavior from the likes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Sean Penn, who has repeated the acts of Hanoi Jane from a generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago. He is still walking around and casting for movies. Reps Baghdad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bonoir and Jim McDermott, ditto, and they are still congressmen.
</em><br>
<p>I will be on Samantha's side in an instant as soon as the likes
<br>
of Sean Penn and messieurs Bonoir &amp; McDermott are in any way
<br>
persecuted by the government.  Their behavior is treasonous in
<br>
spirit, I'll grant, but not by the letter of the law.  Meanwhile,
<br>
it's a free country and they can say what they will.
<br>
<p>What I have learned:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(i) Any measure such as the Patriot Act can cut both
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ways, and one must always imagine how one would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;feel if the opposite party were in power
<br>
(ii) It's not probable that the likes of Sean Penn (who
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is not half as bad as Jane Fonda was), or any others
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be persecuted by the U.S. government for their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political beliefs.  I could be wrong.
<br>
<p>Lee
