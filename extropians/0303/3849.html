<p>No, but we could legislate things that would make it easier for people to
<br>
restrict caloric intake. For example, schools could stop offering young
<br>
people corn-syrup laced soft drinks, thus starting lifelong bad
<br>
habits, instead offering diet soft drinks or even better fruit juices and
<br>
flavored waters. This would invite opposition by soft drink
<br>
industry - government could offer incentives for them to switch over to
<br>
healthier products.
<br>
<p>Fast food industry could be required to serve food in units corresponding
<br>
to RDA &quot;serving sizes&quot;. That way people could still eat as much as they
<br>
wanted, but it would be much clearer to them if they were overeating. If
<br>
the industry saw a decline in consumption, they could just raise unit
<br>
prices. That would be a win-win all the way back to the farm.
<br>
<p>Just a few thoughts...
