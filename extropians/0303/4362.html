<p><em>&gt; someone said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;Well, the immigrants, of course. Isn't it a good deal for everyone?
</em><br>
<p>It wasn't just someone.  It was me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe, maybe not.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure if the immigration policies put forth by the media (via &quot;think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tank&quot; studies funded by low-cost-labor loving corporate lobbies) are correct 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or incorrect, but when I see the amount of propaganda being spewed and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonization rites being performed upon immigration naysayers, I get very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nervous.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you are right.  This is a phenomenon.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And then there is the cultural issue, and also issues of what possible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attributes may be associated with a race that may immigrate.  I am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure whether these issues are significant, but when there is so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money available to cram these policies down the throats of the citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of western cultures, I get very suspicious. 
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think that there is more money, or going to be more
<br>
money, that is pro-immigration than anti-immigration?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would see to me that a country and its present situation is at least in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some aspect a product of the people and culture that constitutes its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizenry.  Deriving that conclusion should not be rocket science.
</em><br>
<p>True.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The well being of the citizens of a country is not dependent solely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the depth of its topsoil or the number of its oil wells.  It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me that the culture of the people is a major factor in its well-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being.  And large amounts of immigration from country A to country B
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would seem to make country B's culture more like country A's culture.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it may also make the actual immigrants more like
<br>
country B's inhabitants than country A's inhabitants, 
<br>
especially over time.  The factor here is called assimilation.
<br>
Take France, for example.  No body gets away in France, I
<br>
suspect, speaking anything but French.  I think that newcomers'
<br>
tendency to become Frenchmen is greater than newcomers' tendency
<br>
to become Americans, for example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many other aspects of race that are not even being brought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the public debate.  Is anyone here aware of the frictions and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects caused by different races in public schools?  It is huge!
</em><br>
<p>I keep getting signs about this, but the media downplays or
<br>
ignores it whenever possible.  This is identical to your 
<br>
first point.  The question is whether this is a transient
<br>
cost or not.
<br>
<p>From the Middle-East all the way through the furthest
<br>
reaches of the western hemisphere (moving westward),
<br>
the inevitable tendency appears to be the rise of a
<br>
pigmentocracy  (pronounced &quot;pig-men-toc-ra-sy&quot;).  It
<br>
means lighter skinned minorities exerting dominating
<br>
economic and political influence over darker skinned
<br>
majorities.  I do not think any western country
<br>
immune.
