</em><br>
<p>What happened to good-old-fashioned &quot;This universe is a computer 
<br>
simulation&quot;?  I have a consilient view of everything, but it's very hard 
<br>
to conceive of a humanly simple set of perceptions that would break the 
<br>
consilience; the Kolmogorov complexity of anything I come up with is never 
<br>
going to be any higher than &quot;Eliezer tries to think of a set of sensory 
<br>
perceptions that would boggle Eliezer&quot;, which isn't very complex at all.
<br>
<p>I don't expect to see magick in operation.  I assign it a tiny prior 
<br>
probability; not quite the not-worth-tracking infinitesimal, because 
<br>
specific people have made the claim and I've put specific cognitive effort 
<br>
into evaluating and rejecting it; but still the prior probability is about 
<br>
as tiny as a specifically claimed proposition can get.  Nonetheless I can 
<br>
conceive of the possibility of seeing magick in operation.  I project that 
<br>
my reaction to observing magick would be to start tracking the several 
<br>
Kolmogorov simplest explanations:
<br>
<p>(a) a non-humanly-Friendly SI with evolved inhabitants and Lee Corbin 
<br>
ethics: top-level citizens can run arbitrary simulations containing 
<br>
helpless sentients; someone's playing the god of this world.
<br>
(b) personal hallucinations: I am currently under hypnosis or experiencing 
<br>
organic dysfunction; various externally controlled possibilities
<br>
(c) ordinary VR game simulation in a pre-Singularity world, with elided 
<br>
memories
<br>
<p>Note that in all cases the *pattern* of magick ultimately comes from the 
<br>
memes of an evolved pre-Singularity civilization - the idea of magick is a 
<br>
specific complex pattern that I would not expect to have a simpler 
<br>
explanation than its origins as a fiction, even if that fiction were 
<br>
experientially realized.
<br>
<p>To see magick *as magick*, it would have to have a consilient explanation 
<br>
that fit in with everything else, an explanation that did *not* invoke an 
<br>
enclosing simulation translating a human fiction into reality.  Presumably 
<br>
if magick did exist, as magick, then there would exist a valid 
<br>
deconstruction of my information-theoretical objections to it, and after 
<br>
hearing the explanation I'd slap myself on the forehead and go:  &quot;Duh! 
<br>
What a simple pattern!  It's clear that you can't have a universe like 
<br>
this one without ritual spellcasting that uses spoken Latin phrases and 
<br>
virgin's tears; it'd be like having a periodic table that was missing the 
<br>
element of mercury but was otherwise exactly the same.  I'm especially 
<br>
embarassed about mistaking the human rationalizations and distortions of 
<br>
this phenomenon for anthropomorphic inventions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Now *that* is hard to imagine.
