<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks a million!  This is almost as good as Tegmark's.
</em><br>
<p>Referring to Tegmark's paper about four different ways that &quot;parallel
<br>
universes&quot; arise in modern physics,
<br>
<a href="http://it.arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302131">http://it.arXiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0302131</a>.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The central, compelling, and overwhelming fact:  the theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Inflation, accepted by roughly 95% of cosmologists, calmly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicts an infinity of Earths of any given description.
</em><br>
<p>This is only the second of Tegmark's four ways of finding infinite Earths.
<br>
The first is simply an infinite universe, the third is the MWI, and the
<br>
fourth is the notion that &quot;everything exists&quot; in the Platonic sense,
<br>
explored on Wei Dai's everything-list.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The philosophical implications are simply staggering.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer can I be &quot;The Speaker for the Uninstantiated&quot;, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I used to aspire.  I even must retract &quot;It is our duty to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rescue as many people from non-existence as possible&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I have been claiming for fifteen years!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why?  Very simply because everyone already exists.  I had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been aware that this was an implication of MWI, and Hal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had even stated as much on this list a few months ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But an *interpretation* of QM, coupled with the &quot;ghostly&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feel of the Other Worlds, combine to render the existence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of every possible person and alien moot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But now, nothing could be more concrete.  From the simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumptions of the concordant universe, i.e., the homogeneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe first proclaimed by Saint Bruno in 1600, inflation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proves universal existence.
</em><br>
<p>Or, if Tegmark's first level works, homogeneity implies universal
<br>
existence even without inflation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It remains for us only to determine how much run time people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---including ourselves---are to get.  And of course, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer failing to specify the maximum possible fails to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attain the highest morality.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, perhaps you can re-style yourself The Speaker for the
<br>
Underinstantiated.  Rather than rescuing people from non-existence,
<br>
you can strive to maximize the total quantity of sentient existence.
<br>
<p><p>One of the paradoxes that I have always struggled with is this: if you
<br>
run exactly the same conscious program twice, does it matter?  Does it
<br>
increase the &quot;measure&quot; or &quot;probability&quot; of that conscious experience?
<br>
Do I do good by re-running someone's pleasant experience, and harm by
<br>
re-running a bad one?
<br>
<p>The reason it's a paradox is because re-runs are particularly prone to
<br>
philosophical slippery-slope arguments where we blur the lines between an
<br>
&quot;actual&quot; re-run and what amounts to a picture of one.  I won't recap the
<br>
arguments here, they have been discussed ad infinitum in the archives.
<br>
The point is that only re-runs are succeptible to these arguments;
<br>
fresh runs doing novel calculations cannot be replaced by pictures of
<br>
themselves because the pictures won't exist until the calculation is done.
<br>
This has led me to consider the possibility that re-runs don't count,
<br>
that they carry no experiential (and therefore moral) weight.
<br>
<p>However, the notion of many-worlds at Tegmark's level 1 and 2 suggests
<br>
that we do have to consider identical universes to add to the measure
<br>
and probability of the experiences they contain.  We have all these
<br>
identical Earths, and for probability to work right we need to assume
<br>
that the total probability for a given experience is proportional to
<br>
the fraction of Earths where that experience happens, even though many
<br>
of them will be identical.  Therefore identical calculations must be
<br>
counted and added separately in considering their contribution to the
<br>
overall probabilities of experience.
<br>
<p>I will have to give more thought to the paradoxes of instantiation of
<br>
repeated experience, to see if these simpler and more concrete levels
<br>
of parallel universes can shed any light on the problem.
<br>
