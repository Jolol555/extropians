<p>Feh. I think the problem is, you and some other people take everything 
<br>
so literally. Personally, I read pro-war stuff all the time, maybe not 
<br>
quite as much as anti-war stuff but still quite a bit. The impression I 
<br>
get is that most pro-war types -- at least those on TV -- just don't 
<br>
even attempt to understand the anti-war p.o.v.
<br>
<p>Steve Davie's post seemed to me a well-written summation, but it didn't 
<br>
tell me anything I didn't know. I'd wager many extropians (except me, I 
<br>
can't write) could have assembled something similar and at least halfway 
<br>
decent.
<br>
<p>I can't write that well, and if I tried, I'd make it into a fantasy 
<br>
scenario where Iraq becomes a big airstrip for pre-bombing the rest of 
<br>
the middle east. I'd talk about pre-bombing (SAM sites, radars, stuff 
<br>
like that) even friendly countries and explain it as just preparatory 
<br>
bombing in case they can't stop their internal terrorist factories 
<br>
forcing us to do some bombing for real. I'd talk about how I think daily 
<br>
bombing should be part of any sanctions package. And I'd conclude with 
<br>
saying that I don't think we've given daily bombing enough time to work.
