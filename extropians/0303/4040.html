</em><br>
<p>Sorry Ramez, but Saul Kent the head of the LEF has been funding aging
<br>
research for some time.  I believe he funded the studies by Weindruch
<br>
and Prola in the late 1990's.  (They used a slightly more advanced set
<br>
of methods than we used at Aeiveos Sciences Group in the mid-1990's
<br>
but the got the same results with regard to genes that were expressed
<br>
differently with age.)
<br>
<p>Saul is, I believe, also funding Greg Fahy's work on how to vitrify
<br>
organs and bodies at 21st Century Medicine.  This makes sense to Saul
<br>
as he is quite a bit older than you and somewhat older than I, so
<br>
if the the real prospects for life span extension don't happen (stem
<br>
cells, drugs, organ replacement), then he is, I think, ultimately go
<br>
the cryonics route -- so its in his best interest to support that.
<br>
<p>As far as &quot;products of questionable value&quot;, I'll cite two things.
<br>
I can't believe that there isn't a reasonable amount of genetic
<br>
variance in your ability to absorb vitamins and minerals (hemochromatosis
<br>
and iron absorption for example).  The bacteria in your gut also
<br>
produce some vitamins -- so whatever strains you received as child
<br>
may determine the quantity of vitamins available to you.
<br>
Some of the newer vitamins may be very important.  Lipoic acid
<br>
may serve as an anti-oxidant in your mitochondrial membranes.
<br>
For a long time it was thought that coenzyme-Q served that
<br>
function.  I actually suspect it is some balance between
<br>
the two that controls the amount of oxidative damage to your
<br>
mitochondria but we just don't know yet.
<br>
<p>So I don't view the &quot;questionable value&quot; statement as a fair charge
<br>
unless you mean it in the sense that some people may benefit but
<br>
others may not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Venture Capital firms (ARCH and Oxford Biosciences are funding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elixir / Centagenix)
</em><br>
<p>One thing to remember in all of this is that it can take 6-10
<br>
years to get a drug approved.  So even if we had one today it
<br>
would be a while before we could start using it.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, organ transplants or your own stem cell
<br>
transplants do not require significant approvals.  Gene therapies
<br>
and implanted devices go through a completely different approval
<br>
process (from that of the standard FDA drug approval) as well.
<br>
Those two are generally faster than drug approval processes.
<br>
<p>One final thing -- I believe that George Roth who has done some
<br>
of the research on 2-deoxy-D-glucose and has told me that it
<br>
has a very small effective dosing range (too large and it shortens
<br>
the lifespan or kills the animals).  I doubt very much the FDA
<br>
would ever approve it because the chances are too high that
<br>
people would OD on it.  George has indicated they (his new
<br>
company) are working on some safer alternatives.
<br>
