<em>&gt;This further supports Mike's statements, no amount of intelligence and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perserverence from guerilla tactic anarchists can defeat a massive statist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invasion with advanced weaponry and overwhelming firepower.
</em><br>
<p>Mike was making a statement against words that I never said, putting
<br>
words in my mouth (which makes me more than a little angry). I did
<br>
not see any attempt by him or you or others to look at what Dan and
<br>
I pointed links to regarding the definition of anarchocapitalism. I
<br>
only saw some bizarre references by Mike to who he thinks are
<br>
'anarchists'. The Afghan comment was really the one that got me
<br>
upset, though, apologies to the list that I responded to his
<br>
baiting.
<br>
<p>If I wanted to get to my point about how noncentralized political
<br>
structures are more conducive to humans growth in the future off
<br>
this planet (which was really my original intention, but some people
<br>
here, who seem to be stuck on war, sidetracked me), then I lost
<br>
interest. If anyone is wondering why more enlightened topics not
<br>
often-enough  make into broad discussion on extropians, then here is
<br>
one reason why. For me, it takes too much energy to talk about that
<br>
here, fighting against narrow-minded views and I see little interest
<br>
with these people  to look into it further and  study the sources.
<br>
My personality doesn't relish fighting in general, and my hands
<br>
don't have the typing ability, and it is not worth my time in general.
<br>
I see too many knee-jerk responses here. The answer is to  set up
<br>
kill-files, but  I have  the same psychological blocks with using
<br>
kill-files as those  discussed  by Emlyn.
<br>
<p>The title of the message is of course, referring to what the Afghan
<br>
people called the invasion of the Soviets in 1979. How many millions
<br>
disappeared? Nobody knows. By the crudest estimates, some 10 million
<br>
Afghans by 1986 no longer existed and a generation of Afghans mostly
<br>
gone (dead, in prisons, in refugee camps, escaped to the west). The
<br>
largest population of refugees in the 1980s were the Afghan
<br>
population. The world was very silent during this time.
<br>
<p>Please read some history and please talk to some Afghan refugees
<br>
from that time. There is no better source than the people who were
<br>
actually there.
<br>
<p>After you do that, then, please read some eyewitness accounts such
<br>
as Lessing's book.
<br>
<p>A history note:
<br>
The Soviets invaded Afghanistan in 1979. The Afghans fought
<br>
them with little help, surprisingly successively for a large
<br>
part of that war. Please look to Soviet sources or talk to Russians
<br>
for how difficult  of a time the Soviets were having.
<br>
<p>The U.S weapons to the Afghan fighters were not until some
<br>
7 or 8 years later.  We all know how that turned out, don't we?
<br>
Oh yes, it's lovely to have two  superpowers using an innocent
<br>
people for their political goals.
<br>
<p>to save my typing fingers
<br>
<p>&quot;Creating new states (Chechnya and some similarities to
<br>
Afghanistan, Baltics)&quot;

<p>I will stop responding to and reading this thread, now.
