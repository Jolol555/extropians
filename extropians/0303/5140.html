&quot;I already told you: they hate Saddam and want him removed too, but by
<br>
peaceful disarmament. It could have worked out this way: 300.000 British and
<br>
US troops stay in Kuwait. The costs for this threatening scenery could be
<br>
split up between all nations - and Germany would gladly pay for it, too.
<br>
Then let the inspectors in and do their job.&quot;
<br>
<p>Humania, something you neglect to acknowledge is that a 'peaceful
<br>
disarmament' did not work.  Hussien did absolutely nothing until the
<br>
credible threat of force was presented to him, and then, and only then, did
<br>
he let inspectors in.  He continually stalled and delayed the inspectors, as
<br>
all that was needed was to show the inspectors the thousands of banned
<br>
weapons, chemical warheads, and growth media that the 1994 UN inspection
<br>
team had found.  His co-operation was continually declining, even though he
<br>
continued to give small snippets of co-operation, primarily to politically
<br>
divide the world.  His behavior was far from full co-operation, and Blix
<br>
even said as much.  The UN resolution called for full co-operation, and if
<br>
not there would be 'serious consequences'.
<br>
<p>You keep parroting this mantra of peaceful disarmament, yet I had asked you
<br>
before, what if peaceful disarmament doesnt work?  What if an aggressive
<br>
despotic nation has absolutely *no* interest in peaceful disarmement?  You
<br>
seem to tout this mysterious universe where peaceful disarmament will
<br>
*always* work if given enough time.  There is no evidence to suggest this is
<br>
the case.  Saddam only co-operated with the real threat of force presented
<br>
to him.  You talk about the 300,000 british troops 'staying in kuwait'  If
<br>
they are not there as a threat to Invade Iraq, Saddam would stop
<br>
co-operating.  As soon as he saw they were only present as a bluff, he would
<br>
cease co-operating all together.  You fail to understand this simple point,
<br>
THERE ARE *NO* INSPECTIONS WITHOUT A CREDIBLE THREAT OF FORCE.
<br>
<p>You can continue to live in happy hippy la la land, or you can live in the
<br>
real world of complex geopolitical issues, tough decisions, and dangerous
<br>
murderous dictators.
