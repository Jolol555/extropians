I watched only the last half of the final episode while 
<br>
visiting a friend. (My home==!TV) He'd never read any of 
<br>
Herbert's works, and I spent most of the show explaining 
<br>
events.
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt;mentally compare it to the (I personally think great) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;David Lynch Dune motion picture.  I thought the first 
</em><br>
<p>I agree. Lynch made a good, if atypical, movie of Dune.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I definitely thought the timing of the series was quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interesting to say the least.  Besides the very obvious 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;the spice must flow&quot; analogy, I felt the program hit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;home when it showed a power-hungry ruler who caused great 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pain and sacrifice on the part of others before being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;brought down.  Saddam, though, is certainly not a (at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;least somewhat) sympathetic character like the very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beautiful and twisted Alia! lol
</em><br>
<p>I had to remind my ignorant non-extrope friend while we 
<br>
watched the movie of all the symbolism in Herbert's story. 
<br>
Spice::oil, religion, messianic characters both failed and 
<br>
realized, etc. Most of the religous aspects of the story 
<br>
didn't come across on TV. Alia seemed too willing a party 
<br>
in her own possession; her tragic aspects seemed entirely 
<br>
absent.
<br>
<p>Still, the mini-series captured the book's richness pretty 
<br>
well. Seeing it on TV struck me with some of Dune's 
<br>
transhuman aspects. You have lots of weakly superhuman 
<br>
characters, too many to list. The Ixians and Guildsmen 
<br>
stand out here with their Face Dancers, gholas, and 
<br>
Navigators. Common life extension through melange, and a 
<br>
more radical sort with the gholas. (Yes, the biology's 
<br>
bad. Move on.) Even the race-memory of the Bene Gesserit 
<br>
provides survival for personalities--uploads of a sort 
<br>
running on human minds.
<br>
A nice point that might not have come across the small 
<br>
screen: gholas (clones) are people too.
<br>
<p>You also see in Dune something neglected in our community 
<br>
and in the fiction we favor: the frightening aspect of 
<br>
severe self-transformation. Paul Atredies hadn't the 
<br>
courage to do what Leto did. Faced with the same choice 
<br>
and with the 
<br>
same opportunity, Paul retained his humanity. Leto 
<br>
abandoned his for a greater good. This also parallels the 
<br>
New Testament. Paul and Leto resemble Christ in the Garden 
<br>
of Gesthemane, where Jesus wished to decline the bitter 
<br>
cup. Paul shows a path-not-taken where Jesus didn't make 
<br>
the self-sacrifice. Leto shows the result of the story we 
<br>
all know well. That Paul later resembles John the Baptist 
<br>
doesn't hurt this analogy too much. Liet-Kynes looks more 
<br>
like JtB.
<br>
<p>[snippety-snip]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The special effects CGI was fairly good, but the worms in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Lynch film looked much more real to me.  Still, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was good enough to not really detract from the series. 
</em><br>
<p>Here I disagree. SPFX seemed adequate in the part I saw, 
<br>
but only just. Dune has an impressive setting, but very 
<br>
little visual sizzle--stone-cutters excepted. 
<br>
Post-transform Leto particularly disappointed me. That 
<br>
costume left the actor looking far too normal. Granted, he 
<br>
did show a lot of skin in it and that probably helped 
<br>
ratings. My co-viewing friend did notice the character 
<br>
strolled about the desert sans stillsuit, though.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The sets were quite opulant and the costumes sometimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;badly over the top (in some cases) as in the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;series.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>When I get to be President-for-Life of USA, much less 
<br>
Emperor of the Known Universe, you bet I'll have a far-out 
<br>
set of clothes! Think of a cross between Emperor Norton I 
<br>
and Steve Mann. :-) Seriously, this complaint shows up a 
<br>
good deal, but it didn't bother me. YMMV.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I cared about the characters I was seeing on the screen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;due to the good script and solid acting.  I suppose my 
</em><br>
<p>The adaptation seemed good and the acting matched. Sci-Fi 
<br>
will show Riverworld next here in USA. I'd rather see them 
<br>
adapt other of Farmer's work: Empire of the Nine, Flesh, 
<br>
Barnstormer in Oz, or A Feast Unknown. None of that seems 
<br>
at all likely. Other Herbert adaptations would also be 
<br>
nice: Hellstrom's Hive (with Lynch or Cronenberg 
<br>
directing), or the novel about submarines. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;P.S.  I have a fantasy about turning on the news to see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;President Bush clad in a stillsuit while before the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;troops in Iraq. &quot;Dubya'Dib! Dubya'Dib!&quot; they all chant as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he raises his arms to them.  The Republican party messiah 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thunders out the words &quot;The spice must flow!&quot; and then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hops on the back of a genetically engineered giant Texas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;steer (like Paul Bunyan's &quot;Babe&quot;) and charges toward 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Baghdad with several U.S. armored divisions following his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inspired lead.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It could happen...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Gack! Then we'd later have Condeleeza Rice (channeling the 
<br>
spirit of Dick Cheney) as regent while Rumsfeld ran a 
<br>
hush-hush oil-for-goodies deal in the Iraqi desert? 
<br>
Meanwhile, Dubya'Dib wanders the media wasteland as a 
<br>
televangelist and a horrible transformation takes place in 
<br>
the body of the governor of Florida. Of course, the 
<br>
Republican Party has no place for a clone--er, ghola. Too 
<br>
bad. Ollie  North would have been perfect.
