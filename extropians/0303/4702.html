<br>
<p><p>Well, I'm undecided about the war, but the more right-wing hype I hear about
<br>
it, the less sold on it I am.
<br>
<p>At current hype levels this war had BETTER give us f*cking 10%-per-year
<br>
economic growth, no terrorist acts anywhere ever, and oil at $1/barrel. That
<br>
and Bush not getting &quot;re&quot;-elected is all it will take for me to unequivocably
<br>
start supporting the war.
<br>
<p>For the record, I was in favor of regime-change in Afghanistan as list
<br>
archives will show. So, this is not some kind of knee-jerk opposition to all
<br>
use of force.
<br>
<p>By the way, thanks for raising this issue, Mr. Wiik. I'm so sick of these
<br>
pseudo-libertarians spending more energy sticking it to leftists than being
<br>
consistant with the ideals of personal autonomy and non-coercion.
<br>
<p>The &quot;leftists&quot; on this list are largely intelligent and Extropian individuals
<br>
with whom I disagree on a number of issues sometimes for subtle and
<br>
complicated reasons that have more to do with information theory than whether
<br>
or not they &quot;love America&quot; or &quot;love Freedom&quot;.
<br>
<p>The pseudo-libertarians who fill this list with liberal-baiting, childish,
<br>
ad-hominem insults are interfering with the spread and evolution of
<br>
libertarian memes. They are like Revolutionary Workers League moles
<br>
infiltrating real activist groups or Scientologist moles infiltrating damn
<br>
near anything they can.
