I like the idea in general, but I see certain problems. I wish the average
<br>
US classroom had enough wits to be able to help a &quot;third world
<br>
village&quot;. But the village would probably be better off getting some
<br>
volunteer suggestions from adult experts to the blog. 
<br>
<p>Maybe a three-way effort would work - classroom adopts panel of experts as
<br>
well as village, then facilitates their communication. The village would
<br>
also need an on-site expert to facilitate the mechanics of the Web access
<br>
and possibly getting over the language barriers. So it would be a four-way
<br>
effort. Last but not least, the effort would probably need political
<br>
&quot;protectors&quot; in both countries, to prevent political dangers from daring
<br>
to communicate across interests. So that brings it to a six-way
<br>
effort. But still not too complicated. Surely somebody has done something
<br>
like this before?

<em>&gt; &gt; I've done some thinking..., one idea being providing web

<em>&gt; &gt; third world village which would then be 'adopted' by a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of their environment, plus things like mailing soil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; samples for analysis, etc, and the challenge to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; classroom is how much they can improve [sic] villager
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life via all or mostly information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a great idea!  I can't think of anything to teach
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humility to the American students as quickly as that!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Basically, the individual villagers blog their individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; needs and desires into blogs which are aggregated by the class.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aggregate need!  Wonderful.  Someone should tell Paul
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samuelson so that he can incorporate this new concept
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into his worthless books.  (sorry for the sarcasm in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this paragraph)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I could see even elementary classrooms participating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in this, perhaps interacting with the villager kids,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or data entry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What they would learn is one of life's most important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lessons, to wit, ***Eternal Truth Number One***:  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      Nothing is Simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What sounds easier than the students applying their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Western wisdom to the down-trodden in the poorer areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the world?  What sounds simpler?  They would, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, discover that it's not so simple, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;natives&quot; have a vastly better understanding of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own situation and what can be done that do the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant foreign students.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I mean, if helping the poorer countries has escaped the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best minds in the IMF and World Bank, and their trillions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for decade after decade after decade, I hate to break it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you, but the students are going to find that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely nothing they can do.  It would be a miracle if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they came to understand the &quot;natives&quot; situation one tenth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as well as those benighted souls.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are significant barriers here, especially language, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; probably most conversation would be mediated by automated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; translation systems.  Villagers might be hesitant to discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; personal needs and desires and that would perhaps take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; significant time and repeated friendly (and non-judgmental)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interaction to overcome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The villagers might also be reluctant to disabuse the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children of their fantasies.  A non-public remark of one villager
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to another might be, &quot;I understand that we are putting up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this silliness because somebody over there might send some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money, but shouldn't we be honest with the poor kids?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The kids would get some benefit of being like consultants,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's what American kids need these days!  More self-esteem!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; outside the politics and social structures of the villagers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and thereby build trust to offer objective advice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This wouldn't be at all dangerous; the wise villagers would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know exactly what to do with the children's advice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Whatever the benefits to the village, the benefits to the class could be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enormous. All education would be geared toward solving real-world goals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in real-time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry, but it's really difficult to believe that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are being serious here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps some social science subjects would be shifted to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; lower grades, as they might, for example, research history
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to prepare summaries for the higher grades who turn these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; into direct recommendations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; An example might be 'find ways similar tribal conflicts 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have been resolved before' etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes!  And with the skills the kids develop, they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man the hotlines to resolve domestic disturbances,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intractable corporate mergers, and any number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicts that periodically arise between groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and individuals.  (Why isn't there an emoticon for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sarcasm?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why, they could even intercede on the Extropians list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to soothe troubles arising between groups calling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other &quot;trolls&quot; and other names, and troubles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that arise from certain overly cynical and sarcastic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons sticking it occasionally to other posters.
