<p>
Forgive me, I need to quote Anders Sandberg at length from the 
<br>
Leaderless Resistance thread:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have always found these &quot;and then a miracle happens&quot; scenarios
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlikely, both the technological found here or the &quot;consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change&quot; version greens often invoke with about the same amount of faith.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it seems equally unlikely that the standard scenarios I complained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about above would be true, other than in a very general way. What these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios lack is the organic complexity of real history. They are too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much like one-dimensional stories to be even believable eigenvectors of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, even without magical tech we could get some rather sweeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes if at least part of the population become fluid &quot;smart mobs&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empowered by wireless communications and google. That in turn could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduce complex stresses between the &quot;fluid&quot; and &quot;crystalized&quot; parts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of society which could express themselves in far more ways than &quot;group A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppresses group B&quot; or &quot;group A takes over from group B&quot;. And so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fun part of scenario planning is to figure out these second order
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effects. They might not come true, but they help us understand those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-intuitive feedbacks and evolutionary phenomena that surprise most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planners.
</em><br>
<p>I've done some thinking along these lines, one idea being providing web 
<br>
access (allowing for individual blogs) to some hungry third world 
<br>
village which would then be 'adopted' by a classroom in the U.S. The 
<br>
villagers could blog details of their environment, plus things like 
<br>
mailing soil samples for analysis, etc, and the challenge to the 
<br>
classroom is how much they can improve villager life via all or mostly 
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>Basically, the individual villagers blog their individual needs and 
<br>
desires into blogs which are aggregated by the class.
<br>
<p>I could see even elementary classrooms participating in this, perhaps 
<br>
interacting with the villager kids, or data entry. Maybe even better: 
<br>
they provide direct support to upper classes and graduation (from 
<br>
elementary school or junior high) also means 'adoption' of a village 
<br>
which you now are involved with upon high school graduation. (Excuse the 
<br>
U.S.-centric terminology)
<br>
<p>There are significant barriers to here, especially language, and 
<br>
probably most conversation would be mediated by automated translation 
<br>
systems. Villagers might be hesitant to discuss personal needs and 
<br>
desires and that would perhaps take significant time and repeated 
<br>
friendly (and non-judgmental) interaction to overcome. The kids would 
<br>
get some benefit of being like consultants, outside the politics and 
<br>
social structures of the villagers and thereby build trust to offer 
<br>
objective advice.
<br>
<p>Whatever the benefits to the village, the benefits to the class could be 
<br>
enormous. All education would be geared toward solving real-world goals 
<br>
in real-time. Perhaps some social science subjects would be shifted to 
<br>
lower grades, as they might, for example, research history to prepare 
<br>
summaries for the higher grades who turn these into direct 
<br>
recommendations. An example might be 'find ways similar tribal conflicts 
<br>
have been resolved before' etc. One might imagine much larger 
<br>
classrooms, with teachers in all subjects roaming about to small groups 
<br>
to offer specific education. Kids might grow up with years of direct 
<br>
experience in solving real-world problems. It seems empowering.
