Total Recall 
<br>
The future of memory.

<p>A map of the brain
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Losing your memory is the great terror of our age. Anxious baby boomers
<br>
are constantly assessing the fitness of their memories: Doc, I forgot my
<br>
son's telephone number-do I have mild cognitive impairment?
<br>
Memory-related diseases are particularly alarming because they strike
<br>
randomly, progress inexorably, and develop slowly enough that you know
<br>
what's happening to you. Only 4 million Americans suffer from
<br>
Alzheimer's disease, but surely 100 million of us worry about it. 
<br>
<p>A pharmaceutical truism: From great anxieties come great profits. Drug
<br>
companies are pouring cash into research on memory ailments, knowing
<br>
that billions await the firms that can protect memory or slow its
<br>
decline. And when those drugs arrive, you can be sure the forgetful sick
<br>
won't be the only customers. Drugs will migrate from the Alzheimer's
<br>
victim to the elderly man with mild memory loss to the healthy
<br>
middle-aged woman who just wants a mental pick-me-up. 
<br>
<p>Improving memory entices enhancers because it's a shortcut to an even
<br>
more tempting goal: increasing intelligence. This series is not tackling
<br>
intelligence enhancement in its own right because our understanding of
<br>
what intelligence is, physiologically, is still so vague. But much of
<br>
what we think of as intelligence depends on memory, particularly on
<br>
what's called &quot;explicit memory&quot;-the memory for facts and events.
<br>
Improving your explicit memory would allow you to perform many important
<br>
tasks of daily life more quickly and accurately. It would make you seem
<br>
smarter. 
<br>
<p>The Memory Pill
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
Memories, in the corners of your mind
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Background
<br>
<p>Scientists are already probing the genome for genes connected to
<br>
Alzheimer's and other memory illnesses. No doubt these genes will be
<br>
understood soon, and gene therapy trials will follow. But for the
<br>
moment, the most likely memory enhancement is in pill form-medicine for
<br>
Alzheimer's adapted for the healthy.
<br>
<p>To understand how memory might be improved, you need to know a little
<br>
bit about how memory works and fails. A small structure in the brain
<br>
called the hippocampus is the nerve center for memory formation. The
<br>
hippocampus is where the crucial switching from short-term memory to
<br>
long-term memory-a process called &quot;consolidation&quot;-takes place.
<br>
Consolidation occurs when certain new synaptic connections between
<br>
neurons are made permanent (or nearly permanent) or &quot;engraved,&quot; as one
<br>
researcher puts it. Most memory diseases involve the steady
<br>
deterioration of consolidation as the ability to form new long-term
<br>
memories decays. You can call on your warehouse of ancient memories, but
<br>
you can't store any new ones.
<br>
<p>Pharmaceutical companies are taking two approaches to protect
<br>
consolidation and ward off memory failure. The first approach arises
<br>
from work on the formation of memory by rival scientists Eric Kandel,
<br>
who has won the Nobel Prize for his work, and Tim Tully. (Each man
<br>
started a company-Memory Pharmaceuticals for Kandel, Helicon
<br>
Therapeutics for Tully-to commercialize his research.) Kandel
<br>
demonstrated the importance of a messenger molecule called cyclic-AMP in
<br>
forming memories. C-AMP stimulates proteins that strengthen the
<br>
connections between neurons. Both Kandel and Tully then worked on a
<br>
protein related to c-AMP called CREB (c-AMP response element binding
<br>
protein). C-AMP activates CREB. CREB, in turn, helps trigger the cascade
<br>
of events required for consolidation. Tully and a colleague showed
<br>
CREB's value by breeding fruit flies with exaggerated CREB production:
<br>
The engineered flies had incredible memories. (Kandel did similar work
<br>
in sea slugs and mice.) 
<br>
<p>Kandel's Memory Pharmaceuticals and Tully's Helicon are working on drugs
<br>
to boost c-AMP and CREB levels. Memory Pharmaceuticals hopes to start
<br>
clinical trials on a molecule that helps slow the breakdown of c-AMP,
<br>
says Axel Unterbeck, its president and chief scientific officer. 
<br>
<p>The second approach, which is pioneered by Cortex Pharmaceuticals, is to
<br>
make a memory amplifier. This research is spearheaded by Gary Lynch at
<br>
University of California, Irvine, and Gary Rogers, Cortex's senior vice
<br>
president for pharmaceutical research. There's a common neurotransmitter
<br>
in the brain, called glutamate, and a protein that responds to it,
<br>
called the AMPA receptor. When the AMPA receptor is exposed to glutamate
<br>
repeatedly in a very short time, it triggers another receptor called
<br>
NMDA at the same location. NMDA starts its signal by admitting calcium
<br>
molecules, which had been blocked from entering the brain cell.
<br>
According to Rogers, when NMDA admits the calcium, the connection at
<br>
that synapse may change, if not permanently, at least for months. That
<br>
synaptic change is thought to be a foundation of memory encoding and
<br>
consolidation. 
<br>
<p>This gave Lynch and Rogers the idea of making an amplifier. They are
<br>
developing a class of molecules called ampakines, which boost the
<br>
glutamate signal through the AMPA receptor. By boosting that signal, the
<br>
AMPA receptor more quickly activates the NMDA receptor. This should make
<br>
it easier to encode information and to promote consolidation. Their
<br>
first ampakine, Ampalex, is in Phase 2 clinical trials (out of three
<br>
phases) for Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
Remembering with the help of pharmaceuticals
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Project
<br>
<p>The memory-drug companies don't like to speculate about memory
<br>
enhancement. The FDA only approves drugs to treat the sick, not to
<br>
improve the well. The companies could make enough repairing Alzheimer's
<br>
victims that they don't need to push a just-for-the-fun-of-it memory
<br>
boost. 
<br>
<p>That said, Cortex's Rogers and Memory's Unterbeck and Kandel believe
<br>
that some of these compounds will be able to do just this. &quot;It's not a
<br>
goal for us with our current pipeline of drugs targeting Alzheimer's and
<br>
depression,&quot; Unterbeck says. &quot;But at some time, it might be possible to
<br>
enhance normal memory performance.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Unterbeck and his colleagues have tested some of their compounds on
<br>
normal healthy mice, and, he says, &quot;We have shown we can improve their
<br>
memory function quite a bit . with no side effects.&quot; But it remains to
<br>
be shown, he adds, how such compounds perform in human clinical trials
<br>
that are currently ongoing in healthy volunteers.
<br>
<p>Cortex has tested Ampalex in healthy adults, and the results are
<br>
promising. For a 1997 study, it gave a single dose of the drug to a
<br>
group of Swedish medical students. After taking the drug, the students
<br>
improved their performance on tests requiring them to identify smells,
<br>
navigate mazes, and make visual associations. 
<br>
<p>If drugs such as Ampalex or Memory Pharmaceutical's molecules are found
<br>
safe for impaired brains and approved by the FDA, doctors may start
<br>
ordering them for younger people who are depressed, as a supplement to
<br>
the usual anti-depressants. The military may prescribe them to soldiers
<br>
to help them perform better in combat stress. And if the drugs prove
<br>
harmless enough, doctors may eventually hand them out to high-schoolers
<br>
before their SATs, or to actors before performances, or to you. 
<br>
<p>The Obstacles
<br>
<p>The first memory drugs are in early clinical trials. No one knows if
<br>
they are safe or what damage they might cause the brain over the long
<br>
term. Data on how much they could boost memory function in healthy
<br>
brains is sparse: The performance of mice and a few Swedish med students
<br>
proves very little. Perhaps the drugs will not improve functioning
<br>
memories, or perhaps they will work too well. Maybe patients will absorb
<br>
too much information, cluttering their minds with useless details-the
<br>
color of the shirt worn by a subway seatmate last Tuesday-and making it
<br>
hard to focus on useful memories. We may need to forget just as much as
<br>
we need to remember. (Other companies, in fact, are investigating
<br>
forgetfulness drugs-compounds designed to help you lose a traumatic
<br>
memory.)
<br>
<p>The Timeline
<br>
<p>If the clinical trials are a success, drugs from companies like Memory,
<br>
Helicon, and Cortex might enter the Alzheimer's market in five to 10
<br>
years. But it would probably take at least a decade for any drug to
<br>
filter into the mass market-just in time for Gen Y to get dosed for its
<br>
MCATs and LSATs.
