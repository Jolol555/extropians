<p>Yes, this is a good way. But it is better to do it in a parallel way 
<br>
than a serial way. 
<br>
<p>The serial looks like this: ----- You start with one reasonable
<br>
conclusion, which leads to another, which leads to another, and so on.
<br>
Eventually you end up in really wild thinking. Which is reasonable if
<br>
each step in the chain has been correct. Unfortunately, such long chains
<br>
are fairly weak rhetorically.  They work great in mathematics and areas
<br>
where one can really do iron-clad reasoning, but for human matters there
<br>
is so much uncertainty and differing interpretations that the steps
<br>
become fragile. Even worse, most listeners can't pay attention to the
<br>
4711 steps of your reasoning, and will only listen to the conclusion -
<br>
which is too wild. 
<br>
<p>The parallel way is like this: ||||| (I turned it 90 degrees to fit it)
<br>
Lots of short arguments that start out from the current world, and show
<br>
how a small, reasonable step leads to a slightly different world. They
<br>
might not all fit together or be strong arguments (just because people
<br>
spend $$$ on nanotechnology it doesn't have to become useful), but they
<br>
reinforce each other and show that there is a big field of
<br>
possibilities. Often the listener responds by suggesting their own short
<br>
step, and you can start building serial arguments *together* instead. 
<br>
<p>Most people are never convinced by a long logical deduction, but they
<br>
are convinced by seeing evidence or ideas again and again.
<br>
<p>I think Gregory Stock makes a good demonstration of this in his book
<br>
_Redesigning Humans_: lots of here-and-now technologies and ideas that
<br>
each are fairly reasonable and likely, but together lead to a transhuman
<br>
future.
