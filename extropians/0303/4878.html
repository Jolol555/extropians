</em><br>
<p>I think it's a complete myth to suppose... but never mind.  At any rate, I 
<br>
have in this case already specified the outcome you say you care about; 
<br>
that I interface with Adolf Hitler by opposing him.  Now, giving this, do 
<br>
you care whether my values and emotions state that Hitler is a loathsome 
<br>
bug or an abused child?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I oppose the punishment of non-punishers; it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;an ESS but I don't think it's a good thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You oppose the punishment of non-punishers in general?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you not think that one could easily create a scenario
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; or upon anyone actually, would be the right thing to do?
</em><br>
<p>Heh.  You can violate *any* heuristic if you impose the right context.  It 
<br>
boots not that the scenario exists if its probability is a thousand to 
<br>
one.  I am saying that I think the punishment of nonpunishers has given 
<br>
rise to poor outcomes, and to human emotions that strike me as dark 
<br>
(emotions which I try to counter within myself, and would advise others to 
<br>
treat likewise).
<br>
<p>It is for this reason that the emotional reaction of &quot;How *dare* you 
<br>
suggest that Hitler is anything more than a loathsome bug?&quot; disturbs me. 
<br>
People should always be free not to hate.  Perhaps there is even 
<br>
justification for getting angry at someone who doesn't help fight Hitler. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;But to demand that someone *hate* Hitler strikes me as, well, Hitlerish. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This is what I mean by saying that punishment of nonpunishers disturbs 
<br>
me.  Punishment of nonpunishers is also an ESS that can lock in 
<br>
negative-sum games and despotisms.  Dark emotion, dark outcome.
<br>
<p>I can understand someone who hates Hitler; I can even understand someone 
<br>
who hates anyone who does not help fight Hitler; when I see someone who 
<br>
hates anyone who does not hate Hitler, I worry.
<br>
<p>Recently this dark emotion has been running completely wild on the 
<br>
Extropians list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As an example---so that one may understand exactly how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abstractly I am talking here---suppose that you here and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now in the year 2003 have three choices with what to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Joseph Stalin, who has (thankfully) been dead 50 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and 17 days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (A) Stalin will get run time in a small cubic centimeter
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       near the orbit of Pluto, where he will have ample
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       time to reflect on his life's accomplishments, his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       victories, and enjoy vodka at a resort on the Black
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Sea with his chums (portrayed versions of Beria etc.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (B) Stalin will continue to not exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   (C) Stalin will undergo punishment for his hideous crimes:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       for each person that he had tortured and who he had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       deliberately murdered, he will be forced to undergo
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       some fraction of their suffering, and the suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       of the countless families associated with his victims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What say you?  (A), (B), or (C)?
</em><br>
<p>(A), obviously, supposing that humanity has straightened out its own 
<br>
affairs and that Stalin can no longer threaten anyone, and that it is no 
<br>
longer necessary to regulate outcomes through the highly inefficient and 
<br>
intrinsically undesirable method of imposing punishments to regulate 
<br>
motives.  Actually, I wouldn't even take (A); I'd just bring Stalin back 
<br>
as an ordinary citizen with all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, 
<br>
including the right to grow up and the right to apologize.
