Sit down Michael
<br>
<p>read your funny little barrel burst one more time, think a little harder and
<br>
then try again to convince me of your superior knowledge. And if you study
<br>
deep enough all sides of your issue and think hard enough, maybe you come up
<br>
with the same (ir)rational conclusion I found: that your text is a Moebius
<br>
loop that can be applied by anybody to *prove* that his opinion is right.

<p><em>&gt; Ron,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dont Dismay, Humania is just not familiar with the concept of coming to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational conclusion after studying in depth both sides of an issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead, if the masses are brainwashed without utilizing a single critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking nueron, it's a'ok as long as it jives with his own idealogy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humania, the point Ron is trying to make is that Teachers should not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing ideas onto children and students, they should encourage children
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; study questions, even difficult ones, and understand both sides of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments, and then make a decision based on a clear understanding of both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides, additionally, they should be able to acknolwedge when they do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know enough to speak intelligently on a subject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With some 80% - 90% of the teachers in the US being liberals, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Teachers Unions donating to liberal campaigns, its not hard to understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why so many students hate America, George Bush, and everything his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration does.  Its hard not to when it is drilled into you from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time you are a young child.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Humania:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;whats wrong with that&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Humania,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        You had a protest of perhaps a few dozen or a hundred teachers.
</em><br>
You
<br>
<em>&gt; proclaim it as a protest of thousands of students.  That is what is wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron h.&quot;
