<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hubert, If they were 'War Criminals' I wonder what you would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; propose doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; about them, exactly.  Say, for example, Bush murdered 100,000 of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; people, or attacked a neighboring country, what would you propose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; international community do about it?  Should an international
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coalition be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; formed to remove him from power, or demand he be removed?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, of course, what else? Remove him from power, bring him to Den
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Haag  and sentence him to prison for the rest of his life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently, Mr. Mania, you have no sense of irony. The respondent was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using acts that Saddam has committed, and which you and your country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem blithely unwilling to bring him to task on. The fact that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so willing to remove Mr. Bush for acts which Mr. Saddam has committed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not willing to remove Mr. Saddam, exposes your hypocrisy and hidden
</em><br>
agenda....
<br>
<p>Yes, you are right, I failed to see the irony here. But anyway, your
<br>
fine President will be responsible for the deaths of American soldiers and
<br>
for invading a country. So, the reasons for accusation remain just the same,
<br>
no matter if I failed to detect ironic statements or not.
<br>
<p>I do not have to hide my agenda. As a friend of the American people I have
<br>
to turn against the current American administration which is a danger for
<br>
world peace and democracy.As I said several times before: I also want Saddam
<br>
to be removed but not on the cost of a mountain of civilian Iraqui corpses,
<br>
which will be a war crime. And that's why Bush actually deserves to be
<br>
sentenced to
<br>
livelong prison. I am not so naive to believe that this will ever happen. He
<br>
and the dead American soldiers will be celebrated as heros. Same old story,
<br>
same old lies, same old shit. It's disgusting.
<br>
<p>I never would have thought that I would ever have to defend a pacifist
<br>
attitude here on the list when I started reading extropian mails in 1996. I
<br>
am amazed how many rednecks are assembled here. But at least they
<br>
convinced me that I am no pure pacifist at all, but a militant one if
<br>
circumstances require this.
<br>
<p>When will the likes of you ever start to see, that the Bush-Aznar-Blair-
<br>
deathist-junta is isolated in the world. Even Bush's own church has
<br>
turned against it's most famous member.Maybe you should start
<br>
reading European news sources on the internet.
<br>
<p>But please...do NOT confuse my personal political position with the position
<br>
of the German Government. They are executing the same dirty weapon business
<br>
as every country in the world. I do not love my Government, but I do support
<br>
their stance against the Iraq war which is a disarmament founded on peaceful
<br>
methods and more patience.
