<p>
So what? WW1 WW2, Kaiser Wilhelm or Adolf Schittelgruber...In both cases
<br>
teachers called for a support of a criminal patriotism that lead to major
<br>
desasters. In spring 2003 Berlin kids *organised themselves* via cell phone
<br>
alarm a ralley against a criminal US killing campaign and were given support
<br>
by *a lot* of their teachers.
<br>
<p>How can you ever believe that *any* of those kids supports Saddam. Not a
<br>
single one. You must be nuts, man and must be caught in the trap, that those
<br>
who are against the war are automatically Saddam supporters. You don't have
<br>
the slightest idea of what is going on in contemporary Germany and generally
<br>
outside your country. You are completey blind to the rest of the world and
<br>
it's concern about the development in the USA.
<br>
<p>Basically your Remarque analogy is not only deadly wrong but a fine
<br>
illustration of White House induced paranoia that seems to poison the
<br>
atmosphere here on the list. In both historical cases - WW1 + 2 -  sick
<br>
patriotism seemed to cause a diminishing of intelligence. The same seems to
<br>
be true today concerning your &quot;P3&quot;, your &quot;proud 'n' pray patriotism&quot;.
<br>
Collateral brain damage might be an appropriate name for it. I find it
<br>
disgusting that some of you folks think it worthwhile to condemn liberal
<br>
German teachers and students because of their peaceful attitude.
<br>
<p>Wake up and let's face it: this time YOU (plural) are the bad guys with your
<br>
P3!
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Errrr.. Remarque (really Kramer spelled with a French pen name for shock
</em><br>
value) wrote about WW1...WW1...Not the funny fellow with a ugly moustache,
<br>
whom the Germans, thought was a teutonic, messiah...this was WW1..envy of
<br>
England's Empire, fearful of a rising industrial Russia (even under the
<br>
poluted Czars), not the death camp war, ok? All Quiet on the Western Front
<br>
was world war 1. Kiddies between 13-16 are easily shaped and looking for
<br>
approval and acceptance. Their teachers bear the responsibility of deciding
<br>
whom the jugend will be against. Its a shame that they chose the Great
<br>
Dictator, Saddam. But, hey, that's Europe for ya.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Humania Exulted:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;You're twisting reality here. 13 to 16 year old humans are sensitive
</em><br>
enough to know what a war is. If freedom and peace loving schoolboys and
<br>
girls organise a protest ralley against a US killing campaign and their
<br>
teachers allow them to leave one hour earlier, you come along with your
<br>
paranoid patriotism and compare it with Nazi teachers urging the boys to
<br>
sign up for the Wehrmacht???? &gt;&gt;
