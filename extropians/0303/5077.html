That's basically irrelevant.  This is a war of aggression, and is 
<br>
therefore wrong.  That it's being sold as something else basically 
<br>
demonstrates the power of the press.  It's not the first time.  Hearst 
<br>
organized the Spanish-American war to sell more newspapers.
<br>
<p>If you want to assert that Hussein is (or was) evil, I will agree.  But 
<br>
he wasn't as evil as having bombs dropped on your head, as having your 
<br>
water supplies destroyed (in the desert!).  Etc.
<br>
<p>I have heard it reported that the CIA assessment was that Hussein was no 
<br>
threat as long as he wasn't invaded.  That sort of cuts the legs out of 
<br>
even the faint justifications of the people who claimed that fear that 
<br>
someone might attack them was sufficient reason to attack first.  (And 
<br>
if it is sufficient justification, just consider where that puts the US 
<br>
now.  Now that it has initiated an unprovoked war of aggression.)
