Samantha said
<br>
&quot;I thought it was our goal to create a world or pockets therein of maximum
<br>
extropy.  I don't see how those pockets can be created without maximizing
<br>
freedom and individual rights.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mike Lorrey replied
<br>
&quot;Neither can I, but I didn't expect Samantha to say this.&quot;
<br>
<p>Nor did I, but I must emphasize that she said &quot;pockets&quot; not necessarily the
<br>
whole world being extropic.  One must wonder to what other areas Samantha
<br>
applies this concept of only parts of a system being extropic.  If we were
<br>
to apply this thinking of hers to questions such as freedom and rights, we
<br>
might understand why should would prefer the Iraqi people remain oppressed
<br>
and un-free, and similiarly supported the enslavement and murder of millions
<br>
of Indochinese people.
<br>
<p>Perhaps Samantha feels that some parts of a system can only become more
<br>
extropic/free/progressive at the expense of other parts becoming more
<br>
chaotic, oppressive and regressive.  Given this context, at least her
<br>
motivations seem internally consistent!  After all, the second law of
<br>
thermodynamics dictates as much for closed systems, perhaps Samantha feels
<br>
'freedom' is something that is conserved.
<br>
<p>This is the closest I have come to figuring her out.
