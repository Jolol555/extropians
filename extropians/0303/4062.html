</em><br>
<p>Canada is also a special case.  Everyone loves Canadians.
<br>
There were a large number of canucks where I went to
<br>
college in Washington state.  They were pretty much every
<br>
last one of em agreeable chaps, good hearted souls.
<br>
Head in the clouds, feet on the ground, as we used to
<br>
say.  I carefully avoided dating Canadian girls, because
<br>
they had a lovable attitude, a most pleasant disposition.
<br>
My reasoning was if I fell for any of them, one of us
<br>
would end up living far from home.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Americans may not exactly be &quot;Hated&quot; around the world, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are many places where you are more tollerated than welcome...
</em><br>
<p>Currently Americans are a grave danger to all
<br>
bystanders wherever they travel.  There are a
<br>
number of extremists who will murder 100 innocents
<br>
in case there is even one American present, such
<br>
as was the case in the Bali nightclub bombing.
<br>
They managed to kill two Americans there, along
<br>
with a couple hundred others.  Collateral damage
<br>
cannot be avoided, you understand.  Such as these
<br>
can never be appeased, so Americans are a danger
<br>
to everyone abroad.
<br>
<p>I propose a passport that is not tied to any one
<br>
piece of real estate, one that is recognized in
<br>
any of the United Nations or even a superset of that.
<br>
<p>I have a vision.  Every nation on this planet
<br>
will eventually be so integrated that conditions
<br>
will be nearly identical everywhere, with some of
<br>
everything, a little like an extended American
<br>
suburb, with government systems that eventually
<br>
converge, becoming so indistinguishable that
<br>
borders are meaningless, superfluous constructs.
<br>
In that day, wars will cease for the same reasons
<br>
that my neighborhood does not make war on the one
<br>
10 streets over, because they are completely
<br>
interchangeable.
<br>
<p>All the world's diversity can coexist on every
<br>
artificially subdivided plot of ground we now
<br>
know as nations.  All governments will be completely
<br>
secular and will protect the rights of the minority
<br>
against the majority, and in some cases the rights
<br>
of the majority against the murderous minority.
<br>
Every human on the planet will be able to choose
<br>
any culture or way of life she wants, without even
<br>
having to move.  Universal freedom of choice.
<br>
