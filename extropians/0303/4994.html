<em>&gt; The point at which the largest companies become a governement 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at which they use force and violent coercion to eliminate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitors and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain a monopoly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reason

<p>Well, yes, and I took your point that you have to accept an amount of that.
<br>
The problem is, that the temptation for a monopoly (PPF / insurance provider
<br>
/ what have you) is going to be very, very large. Who, after all, can stop
<br>
them? No one at all, by definition almost. Is there any other action, once
<br>
they are of that size, that would continue to increase shareholder profits? 
<br>
<p>When you have such an organisation in charge, there is every reason to
<br>
suspect that it will not have the democratic structure that we expect of
<br>
government. Instead, it's likely going to be set up along standard corporate
<br>
lines; that is, feudalism. So this whole private policing/armed forces thing
<br>
looks, to me, like the short road to feudalism, and very nearly to
<br>
socialism; the one company running the show might be pretty difficult to
<br>
distinguish from a single party socialist government.
<br>
<p>How do you guard against this scenario, imo a very likely one, without the
<br>
checks and balances that a system like a modern western democracy requires?
<br>
Bear in mind that in the market you can't very easily have such
<br>
institutions, the embodiment of the separation of powers, because one set of
<br>
powers can buy up another set (ie: you cannot keep them separate).
