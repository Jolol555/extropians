Mania said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what I fear is that this war might be the first step towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a new world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order where the law of the strongest, i. e. USA reigns.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so the truth finally comes out!  The sole reason mania opposes this war
<br>
is because the US is too big and strong!  God forbid a free, democractic
<br>
constitutional republic be the worlds strongest power!!  As MaxPlumm has
<br>
repeatedly pointed out, no country has done more than the US to spread
<br>
democracy throughout the world, yet Mania sees such a country as the worlds
<br>
strongest as a bad thing!
<br>
<p>I would invite Mania, and others, to consider a world where either one of
<br>
these countries were the strongest in the world
<br>
<p>Saddam Hussains IRAQ
<br>
Kim Jong Il's North Korea
<br>
Mao Ze Dong's China
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will not stop shouting, I am against THIS war. You are deadly wrong and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should hear it again every day!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well the more you shout the more likely we are to listen to you, correct?
<br>
As I said in my post, unless you address the reasons why those who support
<br>
the war support it, you will not disuade anyone.  It seems your primary
<br>
motivation for opposing this war *anyway* is that you merely dont want the
<br>
US to be strong.  Instead of Might makes right, its now might makes wrong!
<br>
<p>And I should further point out, that at least for Robert Bradbury and I, you
<br>
are deadly wrong, and your opinions may lead to the end of the human race.
<br>
<p>Samantha said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;As Robert Bradbury pointed out, leaving Saddam in power will cause more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;deaths of Iraqi people then taking him out of power.  He asked anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;to present a reasonable challenge to that notion, and received no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;responses as of yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I didn't reply because I don't believe the general case or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially this specific case can be reduced to such simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equations.  If it a few less people die due to one course over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the other immediately but set into motion a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repurcussions that lead to many more deaths this clearly would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be a win.  But there is no way to easily quantify these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuller costs.  Those the equation is not of much value to me at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Samantha, as I just pointed out to Mania, to at least Robert and I, *your*
<br>
opinions could lead to the end of all human life on earth.  Perhaps with
<br>
this perspective of ours you will understand why we (and perhaps other
<br>
supporters of this war) do not find your arguments in the least bit
<br>
compelling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not in the least &quot;clueless&quot; about this.  Unfortunately for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your argument it has nothing to with our current actions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq. Do you believe with Mr. Bush that they &quot;want us dead&quot; just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they are E-V-I-L and we are so filled with Light and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is Good?
</em><br>
<p>Aha! I say...  Here I get the feeling the ultimate objection that Samantha
<br>
(and possibly Mania have) is that to acknowledge this war is just is to
<br>
acknowledge that there is *actually* a country out there that is indeed
<br>
worse than the United States.
