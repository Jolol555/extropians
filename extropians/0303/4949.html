<p>Very nice list, Dan.
<br>
<p>Here's one more. This author analyzes in detail a national defense
<br>
for an anarchist society, so this then might address Rafal's concerns.
<br>
<p>According to this author's categorization, I would be one of those
<br>
who say &quot;there would be no state to conquer&quot;. I don't mind. I'm glad
<br>
that this author has given a lot of thought to the concept, and I
<br>
appreciate the many people who are thinking and looking into this
<br>
idea. Preston analyzes Hoppe, and he does address the free rider
<br>
problem. Whether that is satisfactory, is up to the readers.

<p>Anarchist National Defense and Foreign Policy
<br>
by Keith Preston
<br>
<p>In fifteen years of attempting to explain anarchist ideas to others,
<br>
by far the most common objection I have encountered involves the
<br>
matter of the alleged vulnerability of an anarchist society or
<br>
territory to external marauders or invaders. It is claimed that a
<br>
powerful centralized state in possession of a large military
<br>
bureaucracy is essential if outward aggressors are to be deterred or
<br>
repelled. If an anarchist nation were to be little more than a
<br>
&quot;sitting duck&quot;, ripe for conquest by any foreign power willing to
<br>
make the effort, then this would indeed seem to be a fatal blow to
<br>
the anarchist position. The defensibility of an anarchist society,
<br>
in a military sense, is a crucial : perhaps the most crucial
<br>
: question in determining the legitimacy of anarchism as
<br>
viable political philosophy.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, this is also the realm of anarchist thought where the
<br>
varying schools of anarchism are the least well-developed. Some
<br>
anarchists deny that military defense is necessary at all and
<br>
profess either outright pacifism or make the extravagant claim that
<br>
an anarchist society would be immune to military conquest because
<br>
&quot;there would be no state to conquer&quot;, citizens of the anarchist
<br>
society would resist conquest through civil disobedience, an
<br>
anarchist nation would have no enemies, &quot;the free market would take
<br>
care of it,&quot; or other inanities. All of this seems to me to be
<br>
wishful thinking of the highest order. The question of military
<br>
defense is one that anarchists must be able to answer effectively if
<br>
anarchist ideas are to ever be taken seriously by more than a
<br>
handful of people. With the notable exception of David Friedman (1),
<br>
no major anarchist theoretician has ever attempted to deal with this
<br>
question in a realistic or nuanced manner. Even those who have
<br>
approached the issue, like Hans Hermann Hoppe or the Tannehills (2),
<br>
rely on some simplistic assertion, like the idea of defense services
<br>
provided by insurance agencies, as a means of dismissing the
<br>
question. Simply put, anarchists are going to have to do better than
<br>
that. The efficacy of anarcho-armies organized by insurance
<br>
companies is by no means a proven fact. Much, much more serious
<br>
study and analysis needs to be given to this issue of utmost
<br>
importance. It would seem that there are three primary questions
<br>
that need to be answered: the matter of how anarchist defense forces
<br>
would be organized and financed, the manner by which the task of
<br>
actually defending an anarchist country would be executed, and the
<br>
implications of a post-nuclear world for anarchist military theory.
