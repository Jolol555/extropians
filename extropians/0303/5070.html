<p>
Ron,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dont Dismay, Humania is just not familiar with the concept of coming to a
<br>
rational conclusion after studying in depth both sides of an issue.
<br>
Instead, if the masses are brainwashed without utilizing a single critical
<br>
thinking nueron, it's a'ok as long as it jives with his own idealogy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humania, the point Ron is trying to make is that Teachers should not be
<br>
forcing ideas onto children and students, they should encourage children to
<br>
study questions, even difficult ones, and understand both sides of
<br>
arguments, and then make a decision based on a clear understanding of both
<br>
sides, additionally, they should be able to acknolwedge when they do not
<br>
know enough to speak intelligently on a subject.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With some 80% - 90% of the teachers in the US being liberals, and the
<br>
Teachers Unions donating to liberal campaigns, its not hard to understand
<br>
why so many students hate America, George Bush, and everything his
<br>
administration does.  Its hard not to when it is drilled into you from the
<br>
time you are a young child.
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
<br>
<p>Humania:
<br>
&quot;whats wrong with that&quot;
<br>
<p>Ron:
<br>
&quot;Humania,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a protest of perhaps a few dozen or a hundred teachers.  You
<br>
proclaim it as a protest of thousands of students.  That is what is wrong.
<br>
Ron h.&quot;
