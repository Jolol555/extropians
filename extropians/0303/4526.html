This is what they sent out on the NHS cascade. 
<br>
<p>Excuse me. I pasted text rather than a link as the NHS net doesn't allow
<br>
casual browsing through its firewall - allegedly. 
<br>
<p>They neglected to mention that most of the deaths are amongst medical staff.
<br>
<p>Nice.
<br>
<p>Rgds,

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CMO Urgent Communication: Acute respiratory syndrome 
<br>
(Monday, 17 March '03 12:00am)  
<br>
Recent travellers to Vietnam, Hong Kong, and southern China at risk (REF:
<br>
DH)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Chief Medical Officer (CMO) has issued an urgent communication urging
<br>
GPs to be alert to cases of acute respiratory illness in people who have
<br>
recently travelled to Hanoi in Vietnam, Hong Kong, or the Guangdong province
<br>
of southern China. 
<br>
<p>The signs and symptoms of the disease in Hanoi include, most commonly, an
<br>
initial influenza-like illness (rapid onset of high fever followed by muscle
<br>
aches, headache and sore throat). In some but not all cases this is followed
<br>
by bilateral pneumonia progressing, in some cases, to acute respiratory
<br>
distress requiring assisted breathing on a respirator. Some patients are
<br>
recovering but others remain critically ill. The cause of these illnesses is
<br>
as yet unknown. 
<br>
<p>It is recommended that patients with atypical pneumonia who may be related
<br>
to outbreaks in these areas which are being investigated by the World Health
<br>
Organisation (WHO) are nursed using barrier nursing techniques,
<br>
investigated, and any suspect cases reported to the Respiratory Diseases
<br>
Division or Duty Doctor of the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre,
<br>
Colindale (Tel: 020 8200 6868). 
<br>
<p>The WHO has provided the following case definitions for hospital-based
<br>
surveillance: 
<br>
<p>Suspected case 
<br>
A person presenting to a health care facility after 23 February 2003 with
<br>
all of the following: 
<br>
Sudden onset of high fever (over 38 degrees centigrade) 
<br>
Myalgia 
<br>
One or more respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath,
<br>
difficulty breathing) 
<br>
AND one or more the following: 
<br>
History of travel to mainland China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative
<br>
Region of China, or Hanoi within two weeks of symptom onset 
<br>
History of having cared for, having lived with, having had face-to-face
<br>
contact with, or having had contact with respiratory secretions of, a
<br>
probable case. 
<br>
Probable Case 
<br>
A suspect case with chest x-ray findings of pneumonia or Adult Respiratory
<br>
Distress Syndrome. 
<br>
Suspected or probable cases based on the WHO definition should be considered
<br>
to have possible links to these outbreaks. They should be isolated and cared
<br>
for using barrier nursing techniques. They should be investigated for viral
<br>
and bacterial causes for their illness including the 'atypical' organisms.
<br>
Treatment should include antimicrobials active against both typical and
<br>
atypical organisms. Local hospital laboratories should liaise with local
<br>
PHLS laboratories to ensure that a comprehensive range of investigations are
<br>
carried out. Laboratories are asked to discuss the investigation of such
<br>
cases with the Respiratory Virus and the Respiratory and Systemic Infection
<br>
laboratories of the Central Public Health Laboratory, Colindale (Tel: 020
<br>
8200 4400).

Subject: No answers yet on mystery pneumonia
<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/03/16/mystery.disease/index.html">http://www.cnn.com/2003/HEALTH/03/16/mystery.disease/index.html</a>
&gt; A particularly virulent form of pneumonia had scientists and doctors
&gt; scrambling Sunday for more information to share with a fearful public
&gt; that already has been told to consider postponing visits to several
&gt; locations where the disease has been reported.
This seems to be a particluarly nasty pneumonia.
&gt; Over the past week, more than 150 new or suspected cases of the
&gt; pneumonia have been reported around the world, the WHO said. Nine of
&gt; those people have died.
So far this is a 6% mortality rate. But many of those with the disease 
probably just haven't died yet. Probably we will end up in the &gt;10% 
mortality range.
Hopefully it will not get a chance to spread, or it will make all the 
worlds other problems seem tiny in comparison.
