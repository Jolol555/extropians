<em>&gt; &gt; Samantha, please DON'T respond to this email.  Ronh's and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your views 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on these subjects are well known.  Holding up opposing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogans doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do anybody on this list any good.  Absolutely NOTHING positive can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; come of this discussion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually I have no intention of responding as the record is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty damn clear for anyone who takes time to explore it. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I choose what to respond to and what not to.  I do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciate preemptive meta-monitoring.
</em><br>
<p>Let me make my intentions clear in asking you to not respond.  I've seen
<br>
this discussion multiple times on the list, and never seen anything come
<br>
from it but unpleasantness, especially now that emotions are so inflamed
<br>
over the war.  My *request* -- see the &quot;please&quot; -- was made in the hope
<br>
that a voluntary disengagement over war-related issues could take place
<br>
by those who've made so many posts on basically the same subject (war in
<br>
Iraq good/bad, America good/bad).
<br>
<p>In situations where people's views are well known and are also well
<br>
known to be deeply opposed to the views of some other posters, it does
<br>
no good to simply carry on with the same discussion.  My request is
<br>
aimed at both supporters and opponents of the war, and both to those
<br>
unhappy with American foreign and military policy and those who approve
<br>
of it.
<br>
<p>If you *really* think you've got something *new* to say about these
<br>
things, by all means post away (a statement made to all list members).
<br>

<br>
