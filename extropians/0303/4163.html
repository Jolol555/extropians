<em>&gt; Since the Feds can now snoop into U.S citizen's reading habits,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suggest not to use libraries for your reading material. You might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to think twice about bookstore purchases too.
</em><br>
<p>Anybody who relies on the nationalized banking system (i.e. credit
<br>
cards) gets what they deserve. Pay cash for your purchases, and when
<br>
they ask for your email addy, tell them they already have it. No
<br>
bookstore has gotten my name in years, and still doesn't. Last time I
<br>
bought the quarterly issue of 2600 Magazine, finally figuring out where
<br>
the staff was hiding them in the magazine section (they themselves
<br>
didn't know or wouldn't admit to it), plus SM Stirling's excellent
<br>
alternate history novel &quot;The Peshawar Lancers&quot;, this month's &quot;Nuts and
<br>
Volts&quot; issue, and a few other things. Or did I?

<em>&gt; Libraries post Patriot Act warnings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Santa Cruz branches  tell patrons that FBI may spy on them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The Justice Department says libraries have become a logical target
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of surveillance in light of evidence that some Sept. 11 hijackers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used library computers to communicate with each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the signs ordered by the Santa Cruz library board -- a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elaborate version of warnings posted in several libraries around the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation -- are adding to the heat now being generated by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once-obscure provision of the Patriot Act.
</em><br>
<p>What is interesting is that bookstores which are deleting customer
<br>
purchase records are now also in violation of tax and accounting
<br>
laws...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Section 215 of the act allows FBI agents to obtain a warrant from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; secret federal court for library or bookstore records of anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected to an investigation of international terrorism or spying.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The provision was virtually unnoticed when the Patriot Act, a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expansion of government search and surveillance authority, was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passed by Congress six weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the last year, Section 215 has roused organizations of librarians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and booksellers into a burst of political activity, and is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cited increasingly by critics as an example of the new law's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intrusiveness. &quot;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but don't you know that they are only trying to track down their
<br>
own wetwork people via purchases of &quot;A Catcher in the Rye&quot;???? ;)
