Consider William Randolph Hearst who ushered in isolationist spin in his 
<br>
newspapers,(circa 1920's &amp; 30's)  after championing the yellow journalism 
<br>
that was the pre-emptor, of the Spanish-American War(1898). Remember the 
<br>
Maine, and all that. The majority of the older media surely seem to have 
<br>
chrystalized into a liberal bias, at least axiomatically, antagonistic, when 
<br>
it comes to Republican presidents. When dealing with unions, most of these 
<br>
old media types are indeed, suddenly, monetary conservatives. 
<br>
<p>Beyond the craving for financial solvency, there is the urge, amongst all 
<br>
media owners, to have political power behind the throne. Witness both Ted 
<br>
Turner on the Left, and Rupert Murdoch on the Right. Chosing between the two, 
<br>
I select Murdoch, not because he is always right, but because he is much more 
<br>
often correct or satisfying, then Turner, of whom, the less said, the better!
<br>
<p>Charles Hixson observed:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Who owns the major media?  You may consider them leftist, but I consider 
<br>
them more opportunist.  Certainly the policies of the owners of the 
<br>
media are not liberal.  If they condone a liberal voice in the 
<br>
publication, it is not out of affection for the message, but in order to 
<br>
1) keep control of what can be said, and 2) earn money selling papers.  
<br>
Most ostensibly liberal publications will suddenly turn very 
<br>
conservative when recommending who or what to vote for.  (I didn't say 
<br>
centrist, because that wasn't what I meant.)  &gt;&gt;
