Spike,
<br>
<p>about psychologically adjusting to nudity in an extro crowd-
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Well, the anxiety is more with social interaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than just nudity I suppose. Extropians is a good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;example indeed. At extros 4 and 5, I found that most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of my usual difficulties grokking humans instantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vanished. Here was a group with whom one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;freely discuss mathematics, cryonics, uploading, any kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of raging technology, floating in compressed argon,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;injecting sedatives into a carotid artery, atheism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nanotechnology, the singularity, a bright future
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for transhumankind, all the really good stuff, without
</em><br>
<em>&gt;having to explain anything or get into any silly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;elementary arguments.
</em><br>
<p>Then naturist setting would facilitate such an interaction.
<br>
We can be monkeys under the stars or the sun with
<br>
our toes in the sand!
<br>
<p>It's not like this is something new, though, Spike. I suppose
<br>
you've not heard or read about the excursions and gatherings
<br>
of the early extropes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;ps, if I were to ever participate in a naturist setting,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it could only be at an *extropian* nudist resort.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;pps, but still there's that predominantly-male nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with extropians, so never mind. And thank evolution
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the few female extropians that continue to bear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with us.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't lived in the Bay Area for a little while, but a large
<br>
number of the parties I went to there from mid1980s to mid1990s
<br>
with extro-type people had hot tubs, where usually bathing attire
<br>
was _not_ permitted. For men and women both (there _are_ some number
<br>
of women computer nerds, you know). Nudity was not a big deal then
<br>
and the smart people that I hung around with used that opportunity
<br>
to spendidly relax. The best storytelling I've heard from Keith Henson
<br>
about his nefarious life were while steaming under the stars in a
<br>
crowded  hot tub, for example. Have extro people in the Bay Area
<br>
changed ? I suspect not...

&quot;CALIFORNIA magazine, in an article on &quot;The Man Who Invented Time Travel&quot;,
even  ran a photograph of me doing physics in the nude on Palomar Mountain.
I was mortified---not by the photo, but by the totally outrageous claims
that I had  invented time machines and time travel.&quot;  -- Kip Thorne
