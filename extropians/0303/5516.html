<br>
<em>&gt; Most revealing of all was Murdoch's reference to the rationale for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to war, blatantly using the o-word.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He went even further down this road in an interview the week before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with America's Fortune magazine by forecasting a postwar economic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boom. &quot;Once it [Iraq] is behind us, the whole world will benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from cheaper oil which will be a bigger stimulus than anything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else.&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly how many human lives is this worth to him?
</em><br>
<p>Money being a representation of human labor, and the average human life
<br>
being worth about $6.5 million, according to insurance actuaries (don't
<br>
know if this applies only to Americans or not), if the post-war economy
<br>
expands by $6.5 trillion more than it would have otherwise without
<br>
cheap oil, then that is worth 1,000,000 lives lost in this war for a
<br>
break even. If only 100,000 lives are lost, that is a 1000% return on
<br>
investment. If Iraqi lives are worth half that, economically, then it
<br>
is a 2000% ROI.
<br>
<p>Considering my prior prescience with regard to oil prices in the war, I
<br>
will note that prices have crept upward with the present 'pause' period
<br>
preceding the upcoming Battle for Bagdad. This price represents
<br>
uncertainty over the outcome of this battle, as it seems some real SOBs
<br>
in the media and goverment are spreading FUD about the battle plan and
<br>
the expectations, or lack of, regarding the Fedeyeen resistance,
<br>
possibly specifically to push up these prices to enhance their
<br>
retirement portfolios.
<br>
<p>I will predict that after this battle, oil prices will again drop
<br>
significantly, probably below $25, maybe below $22/bbl. They may creep
<br>
upward some more after that as mopping up operations continue,
<br>
especially if Saddam escapes from Bagdad, Osama-like, and if there
<br>
remains a significant amount of terrorism against westerners in Iraq
<br>
from Fedeyeen in hiding. 
<br>
<p>However, by this time next year, oil prices will be pushing $10/bbl as
<br>
Iraq, with the second largest oil reserves (and some say more than
<br>
Saudi Arabia), starts pumping overtime to pay for the reconstruction.
<br>
<p>I'll note that one conservative muslim nation has just announced they
<br>
will be giving women the right to vote, starting to fulfill another of
<br>
my predictions, that our victory in Iraq will stimulate a flowering of
<br>
reform and liberty in the muslim world. I wonder why some anti-war
<br>
feminists here seem to think this a bad thing...
