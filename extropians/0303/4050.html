<em>&gt; Sorry Ramez, but Saul Kent the head of the LEF has been

</em><br>
<p>Excellent, thanks for the correction.  More funding is good.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as &quot;products of questionable value&quot;, I'll cite two 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things. [reasons why some products may have value]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I don't view the &quot;questionable value&quot; statement as a fair 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I mean it in the sense that there's little or no evidence that most of
<br>
the products they sell actually slow down the aging process or extend
<br>
life.  In many cases (DHEA, anti-oxidant vitamins, etc..) there's
<br>
evidence showing that they in fact *don't* slow the aging process or
<br>
extend life in humans.
<br>
<p>The LEF chooses to sell these substances anyway.  Their marketing
<br>
material has long lists of studies that support (however indirectly)
<br>
their claims that these products can lengthen your life.   But they
<br>
fail to report on the important studies refuting these claims.  To me,
<br>
that seems unethical.  At the very least it's unscientific.  
<br>
<p>In any case, for most of the substances they sell, there's just not
<br>
enough evidence to know one way or another.  There's also not enough
<br>
safety data to know how they'll affect humans in large doses or over
<br>
the long term.  That's &quot;questionable value&quot; in my book.  
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
