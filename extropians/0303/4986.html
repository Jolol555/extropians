<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The entire notion that we even have /instincts/ predisposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; us towards violence is in stark contrast to the doctrine of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Blank Slate, which has been basic dogma throughout the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 20th century.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please support that contention.  I am not aware of any such &quot;dogma&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Though I have not finished it, I will heartily recommend
<br>
(along with Damien) Steven Pinker's &quot;The Blank Slate&quot;.
<br>
It's an absolute *must* read.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Whether or not violent instincts can be controlled depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; greatly upon the individual and that individual's genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; endowment.  Stupidity is also highly correlated with violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behavior.  Soon, I predict, people with especially violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tendencies can be treated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree.  If broad control/channeling of aggression was not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely possible and practical civilization would not have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurred.  Violence is one of many likely possibilities given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our genetic makeup.  It is fortunately not the only or even the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predominant one.
</em><br>
<p>We need to be clear what we mean by &quot;violence&quot;.  I am
<br>
not, I admit, entirely sure what Nathaneal originally
<br>
meant, and was guessing.
<br>
<p>What I mean is the *definite* tendency of *some* people
<br>
within a society to resort to violence to achieve their
<br>
ends, or as an almost unconditioned response.  I am
<br>
excluding, therefore, known violent cultures such as
<br>
the Yanamoto.  Speaking of modern Western societies,
<br>
and including China, those who predictably resort to
<br>
violence have something wrong with them.  I know that
<br>
you believe it's because of the conditions they are
<br>
living in---I will substantiate my point further down.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I completely agree that without genetic modification, too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people will remain violent, and criminal behavior can only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dealt with by the primitive methods now in place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you mean too many people will remain capable of violence or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too many people will choose to be violent?  I assume the latter.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the latter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no such thing as &quot;an instinct for violence&quot; per se. 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; War should be avoided as much as possible and violence curtailed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply because as we become more technologically sophisticated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibility for highly dystopic outcomes, up to and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the destruction of humanity and all higher 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence on this planet, grows.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  And here my agreement would apply whether you were
<br>
talking about individual violence, or state vs. state.  I have
<br>
in mind people like Sir Francis Drake, who was not at all
<br>
likely to be especially violent to the people he lived and
<br>
worked with, but who had an enormous capacity for it when
<br>
directed against other nations.  Or, for another example,
<br>
pick any successful modern general (excluding McClellan).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Levels of violence and ways violence is channeled that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were acceptable at a lower level of technology become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fraught with greater consequences.
</em><br>
<p>Acceptable?  I don't know what you are talking about.
<br>
Therefore, I will guess.  The total rage and tendency
<br>
to violent behavior of some people---though *not* 
<br>
acceptable to me---still allows our civilization to
<br>
function.  But when such people can easily get their
<br>
hands on WMD.... just imagine how many people *tonight*
<br>
living in the city of San Francisco have been turned 
<br>
over by a girl friend, or fired from a job, or made
<br>
uncontrollably angry in some other way, and had their
<br>
hands on a nuke!  Goodbye SF.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Let me address the level of nations for a moment.  Nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are *not* in recent centuries administrated by violent or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sociopathic individuals.  Each such leader, whether it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Putin, Blair, Bush, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Marcos or Pinochet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a very sociable and effective team player.  These leaders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take advantage of the territoriality and instincts of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizens, to serve their citizens by lookout out for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; national interest (or what they perceive to be the nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interest).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stalin? Hitler?  Excuse me?  Some of these individuals were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively psychopathic and some of them practiced genocide.
</em><br>
<p>Those are *not* the same thing.  (When their ends were near,
<br>
each of those people did lose control.)  But let's go back to
<br>
the year 1940, make a duplicate of each of them and teleport
<br>
him to a jail cell, and have you spend a year sharing the cell
<br>
with each.  You would find each to be easy to work with, and
<br>
perhaps (language barriers aside) you'd find each to be quite
<br>
charming.  (After all, they did not reach their positions,
<br>
especially in their early years, by displaying psychotic
<br>
symptoms to the people around them---the people who put a 
<br>
great deal of trust in them.)
<br>
<p>Now each one, Hitler and Stalin, would articulate very dramatic
<br>
and revolutionary *opinions* if you got them onto certain subjects.
<br>
The pity, of course, was that they rose to be heads of states
<br>
where they could put their extreme thoughts into practice.  That
<br>
is all.  They weren't crazy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Some of these individuals believed that killing off
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other humans was quite ok as long as it seemed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance their own goals.  There is nothing good or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;being a team player&quot; about this.
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course!  But then from the point of view of a criminal,
<br>
the chief of police is hardly a &quot;team player&quot; either!  He wants
<br>
to take some people and lock them up in a cage for the rest of
<br>
their lives!  Believe me, if you could take the pulse of all
<br>
the people in the 1930's who worked closely with Hitler or 
<br>
Stalin, you'd learn that each had a very trust-inspiring
<br>
effect on those around him, and that he earned their respect
<br>
for their thoroughness and their ability to work with people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Thus each leader---from Hussein to Blair---acts at some level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to advance what he believes to be the national interest.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; still true that in non-democratic countries, the egos of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leaders have an often appalling effect:  Hitler, or Hussein,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or in fact any politician whose picture is prominently displayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in public as some sort of &quot;Beloved Leader&quot;, often identify their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; own personal interests with those of their nation, and such is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; their control that they get away with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You don't believe any leader acts predominantly from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interest or the interests of some sub-national group[s] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; s/he is part of?
</em><br>
<p>I admit that this is a huge factor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a very wildly ahistorical statement.
</em><br>
<p>What one?  &quot;Thus each leader acts at some level to advance
<br>
what he believes to be the national interest&quot;?  I'll stand
<br>
by that.  You think it's ahistorical because of this:  (?)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; That the leaders may rationalize what they wish to do as being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the national interest in no way says that they are actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting according to what they believe to be the national 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest.  Democracy has nothing to do with it really.
</em><br>
<p>But when someone has truly rationalized something,
<br>
they believe it.  Perhaps you and I use the words
<br>
differently.  (It takes people of great sensitivity
<br>
and desire for truth to pick up the slight signs
<br>
within their own minds that they are rationalizing!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, on an individual level, it would be more fruitful to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask what living conditions would lead to the less perceived need 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for violence.
</em><br>
<p>I totally disagree.  You can prove this to yourself by
<br>
identifying what you think would be living conditions
<br>
that would promote violence, and then observing that
<br>
the vast majority of the people refuse to become violent.
<br>
Take the worst slums in the U.S., for example.  Most
<br>
people are good citizens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not a question of ability.  It is a question of choice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or are we attempting to persuade ourselves that human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no such control as most humans learn as children?
</em><br>
<p>Good question.  I would say that almost all humans do have
<br>
control---i.e., if their incentives are right, then they
<br>
could control their violent urges.  Some counter-examples
<br>
are notorious wife-beaters, who, even when they realize
<br>
what is going to happen if they persist, cannot stop.
<br>
<p>But *most* humans do have control, as you say.  It's just
<br>
that certain criminal types don't have any incentive, by
<br>
the lights of their own value systems, to be peaceful.
<br>
I consider these individuals to be sociopaths.  And I
<br>
think that it's in their genes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I can not think of historical examples in which exhortations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maxims, education, or propaganda has had the desired effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some cultures, e.g. the Amish or Quaker, do succeed sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in multiplying their numbers through peaceful living, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; becoming a force against war.  But to the degree that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; want to credit them, it is their culture, I claim, not their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; having succumbed to someone's propaganda that should get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the credit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think is in their culture that leads to this outcome 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if it is not a set of shared and lived memes?
</em><br>
<p>Correct.  That's what a culture is.  A set of shared, evolved
<br>
memes.  My point was only that these evolved gracefully within
<br>
the community, and that in NO EXAMPLE will one find that they
<br>
succumbed to sudden indoctrination from outside, or to preaching
<br>
from do-gooders, nor to propaganda from their governments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; (And moreover, it must be kept in mind that such cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to date have thrived only inside protective barriers erected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by democratic nations---barriers that keep such pacifistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communities from being quickly overrun by violent nomads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or other nations.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, some of these peaceful cultures did a fabulous job of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facing down or rather coming to amicable terms with violent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups around them.  See the Quakers interaction with Native 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American populations for a case in point.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But let's see why.  The truth is that the Quakers would
<br>
take up very little of the Native American's habitat, and that
<br>
from the perspective of the latter, there was room for everyone
<br>
and even a lot to be gained from the presence of the white folk
<br>
(e.g. trade).  Now I'm less sure that this would have saved
<br>
them from the Nazis, er, I mean Iroquois, the 17th century 
<br>
version of those vicious Teutons.  Everyone who got in the
<br>
way of the Iroquois got destroyed, especially other Indian
<br>
tribes.
<br>
<p>Native Americans afford the greatest diversity of lifestyle
<br>
and habit as can be imagined.  Many were utterly peaceful,
<br>
while many others' culture was incredibly warlike.  The
<br>
advent of guns and horses in the 17th century gave the
<br>
latter quite an advantage over the former.  Before that,
<br>
they were all living pretty much at a subsistence level,
<br>
and it's hard to conquer all the other tribes within
<br>
sight when so much time is spent just staying alive.  But
<br>
horses and guns introduced what has been called the &quot;whirlwind
<br>
culture&quot;, and some tribes just boomed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without some training and dedication to looking for non-violent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solutions (not necessarily as an absolute prohibition however), 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more violence than necessary will result.  In a world where 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large numbers are disenfranchised to a critical level, more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent need to resort to violence will be felt and acted upon. 
</em><br>
<p>Please substantiate that with historical examples.  Quite the
<br>
opposite is the case in the ones I'm thinking of right now.
<br>
The French peasants had no thought of revolt in their completely
<br>
hopeless and downtrodden state until the 1700's when life 
<br>
improved enough for them to entertain thoughts about inequality.
<br>
Even then, the French Revolution had its main springs from the
<br>
middle class, not the peasants.  Sure, there have been peasant
<br>
revolts now and then (e.g. in Russia), but rather seldom, it
<br>
seems to me, considering the conditions under which they lived.
