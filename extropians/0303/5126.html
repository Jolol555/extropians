<p><em>&gt; &gt; As I've repeatedly stated on this list, it appears that far too many

</em><br>
<p>Arguably the Iraqi POWs weren't presented as individuals.  They
<br>
were shown from a bit of distance and they weren't interviewed on
<br>
TV.  The US POWs were presented in personal closeups and were
<br>
subjected to taunting questions.  This is an awfully fine line,
<br>
though.
<br>
<p>It would have been hilarious if the Iraqis had declared the captured
<br>
US troops to be &quot;unlawfull combattants&quot; rather than POWs.  After
<br>
all, we do have some precedent for this, and without Security Council
<br>
sanction this war violates international law (according to the legal
<br>
experts in this part of the world).  In fact, has there even been
<br>
a proper declaration of war?
