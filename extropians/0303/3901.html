<p>
Even though I am much to chicken to experiment in these sort of 
<br>
endavours myself, I have an academic interrest in Psychoactive Drugs. 
<br>
Even though I am not really shure what my opinion is on the use of these 
<br>
drugs.
<br>
<p>Probably I share William Gibson view that todays drugs are like using an 
<br>
axe, and that future drug should be like using a scalpel.
<br>
<p>The effects of todays drugs seems to broad to be really safe and 
<br>
usefull, and there are too many side effects.
<br>
<p>I have searched the web for information, but it seems that all the drugs 
<br>
mentioned are of the axe kind. The only &quot;newer&quot; type of drug, afaik is 
<br>
ecstacy, and even that has a to broad and powerfull effect. Codeine also 
<br>
looks a little in the right direction.
<br>
<p>If I drink coffe I it makes me alert and awake. But on the other hand it 
<br>
also gives me the jitters and I loose my focus. So it really isn't of 
<br>
much help.
<br>
<p>What I would find usefull would be drugs with a single effect. Ie if I 
<br>
had a deadline I would pop one pill that made me focused and one that 
<br>
made fresh.
<br>
<p>I am not really interrested in drugs giving a &quot;high&quot;. I find it more 
<br>
interresting if there are any drugs that just has a sort of &quot;everyday&quot; 
<br>
effect, that can be used rationally to help acheive ones goals.
<br>
<p>And no ... chocolate won't do ;-)
<br>
<p>But unfortunately it seems that all the drug research is going for the 
<br>
more extreme effects. Or perhaps there simply isn't a black market for 
<br>
these kind of drugs, so there is no information avaliable. To bad really.
<br>
<p>Does anybody know something about this? I would think that in time there 
<br>
could be a really big legal oportunity for these kind of &quot;smart&quot; drugs.
