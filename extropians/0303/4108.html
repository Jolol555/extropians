<em>&gt; &gt; First .. Patents reduce freedom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interesting thesis. Wonder what it means. Seems to me imperfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; formed.
</em><br>
<p>It's really a simple matter of definition: a patent is a piece of
<br>
paper that says &quot;Person A is free to develop idea X into products, or
<br>
not, as he chooses; all other persons are forbidden to do that for a
<br>
period of time.&quot;  So if I think I can make someone's idea into a
<br>
useful product or service better than he can, I am forced by law to
<br>
negotiate with the inventor for a license; if he wants more money
<br>
for the license than would make my use profitable, or if he simply
<br>
refuses to license it at all, then my idea just doesn't happen, even
<br>
if it would have been in everyone's economic interest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;  Without patents, innovation will still be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rewarded /when it fulfils a demand/, but not otherwise, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is how it should be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is that demand for a finished product that may take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years to develop and that may have to go through FDA approval
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes etc is real but distant at the R&amp;D stage.
</em><br>
<p>This is the best argument in favor of patents: without them,
<br>
long-term speculative R&amp;D is not feasible.  The question then
<br>
becomes, do we really need long-term speculative R&amp;D?  Do we
<br>
really want the kinds of things that are invented in secret labs
<br>
over many years, or can we achieve the same results by gradual
<br>
refinement and evolution of existing things?  Obviously,
<br>
evolutionary processes /can/ lead to complex, robust systems.
<br>
But designed systems are generally more efficient and powerful.
