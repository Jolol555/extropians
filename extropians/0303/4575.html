I posted this initially in response to Amara's posting of Steve Pelletiers
<br>
editorial questioning the role that Saddam and Iraq played in the gassing of
<br>
the Kurds at Halabja, and subsequently bringing into question the pro-war
<br>
rallying cry of 'Saddam gassed his own people'.  I believe my response was
<br>
lost to many who may have been interested in it from the innacurate title
<br>
and my own verbose posting.  So here it is again, with the summary first...
<br>
<p>In summary, the MTV News Byte Claim that &quot;Saddam Gassed his own people&quot; is
<br>
clearly still true.  There is some question about wheather Halabja was only
<br>
an attack by Saddam which intentionally targeting Kurdish civilians, with
<br>
Pelletiers seeming to be one of the few people that still believe this in an
<br>
apparent sea of overwhelming evidence, as suggested in the letters above.
<br>
But given Saddam's systematic effort to wipe out Kurds in perhaps 180 other
<br>
chemical attacks that were in no way involved with the Iran Iraq war, and
<br>
not even quesitoned by Pelletier, the trumpeting of this particular article
<br>
of Pelletiers as a anti-war trophy is clearly an egregiously incorrect
<br>
interpretation of the facts.

<p><p>matus:
<br>
<em>&gt;You support the unconditional removal of Bush for something he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*might* do but care not about Saddam who *has* done those things!
</em><br>
<p>Amara - &quot;I suggest to look at all sides of the story, gather information
<br>
from as many sources as you can, and not to swallow, hook, line
<br>
and sinker what you hear coming from the White House and from
<br>
American media. It might help to put Iraq in perspective
<br>
with what is occurring elsewhere in the world, too.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Practicing a healthy skepticism especially with regards to what
<br>
comes out of the mouths of politicians and especially when the
<br>
alternative is some thousands/more precious lives gone might
<br>
make it easier to look at oneself in the mirror in the morning.&quot;
<br>
<p>Amara,
<br>
<p>I appreciate your comments and suggestions to indulge in a healthy
<br>
skepticism.  I do, in fact, believe I do.  I certainly do not uncritically
<br>
support everything the US has done, nor do I ceremoniasally criticise
<br>
everything it has done.  My opinions on Vietnam, for example, are probably
<br>
only shared by .001% of the US population, but likely shared by a majority
<br>
of the former South Vietnamese people.  But I retort with a suggestion to
<br>
heed your own advice.  I meant to comment on this earlier when another list
<br>
member posted Stephen C. Pelletiere New York Times Editorial.  Some cursory
<br>
googling reveals some interesting facts on the Saddam gassing the Kurds or
<br>
not gassing the Kurds.  Simply googling until we find an article that hints
<br>
that Iran and not Saddam was resposible for Halabja does not, I feel,
<br>
constitute 'healthy skepticism'.
<br>
<p>To start with, the pretty liberal French Le Monde Diplomatique
<br>
(<a href="http://mondediplo.com/1998/03/04iraqkn">http://mondediplo.com/1998/03/04iraqkn</a>) relays the theory that Saddam was
<br>
responsible for the attacks, outlining a history by Hussain, and in
<br>
particular Hassan Al Majid's efforts to erradicate the Kurds.
<br>
<p>&quot;Hassan Al Majid's chemical experiments began on 15 April. They were
<br>
directed against thirty or so villages in the provinces of Suleimaniyeh and
<br>
Erbil and proved devastatingly effective. Hundreds died. On 17 April, after
<br>
a chemical attack that killed 400 people in the Balisan valley, 286 wounded
<br>
survivors set out for Erbil in search of medical attention. They were
<br>
stopped by the army and shot.&quot;
<br>
<p>This particular article tells the story of a systematic campaign of attacks
<br>
and the use of chemical weapons against the Kurds, with the incident at
<br>
Halabja being the height of the attrocities.
<br>
<p>Note the west, including the US, France, and Germany did little about this
<br>
at the time.
<br>
<p>Next I would point you to this article published in the Kurdistan Observer
<br>
(<a href="http://home.cogeco.ca/~kurdistanobserver/2-7-02-88-gassing-still-killing.ht">http://home.cogeco.ca/~kurdistanobserver/2-7-02-88-gassing-still-killing.ht</a>
<br>
ml)  It is made clear in this article that the Kurds are no fan of the US,
<br>
as the chemical weapons used were supplied by the US, the original event was
<br>
ignored by the US (note is was also ignored by France and Germany) and now
<br>
the US is using it as a rallying call against Saddam.  This particular
<br>
article estimates ~7,000 died instantly in the attack on Halajba, and relays
<br>
that Human Rights Watch estimates that 500,000 to 100,000 people died during
<br>
the Anfal campaign.
<br>
<p>Next I would point you to this page
<br>
(<a href="http://www.dbarkertv.com/pelletiere.htm">http://www.dbarkertv.com/pelletiere.htm</a>) which details responses sent to
<br>
the New York Times editorial section after Pelletiere advertisement for his
<br>
book, er, I mean, editorial was published.  The first response is from the
<br>
former United States Ambassador to Croatio, it reads:
<br>
<p>&quot;In 1988, as a staff member working for the Senate Foreign Relations
<br>
Committee, I documented Iraqi chemical weapons attacks on 49 Kurdish
<br>
villages in Dihok Province along Iraq's border with Turkey. These attacks
<br>
began on Aug. 25, 1988, five days after the Iran-Iraq war ended, and were
<br>
specifically targeted on civilians. As a result of the committee's report,
<br>
the Senate unanimously approved comprehensive sanctions on Iraq. Between
<br>
March 1987 and August 1988, Iraq made extensive use of chemical weapons
<br>
against Kurdish villages as part of a campaign aimed at depopulating rural
<br>
Kurdistan. These attacks have been well documented by human rights groups,
<br>
forensic investigators and the Kurds themselves. Many occurred in places far
<br>
from the front line in the Iran-Iraq war. The Kurdish survivors of the
<br>
Halabja attack all blame Iraq, and many report seeing Iraqi markings on the
<br>
low-flying aircraft that delivered the lethal gas. While the most deadly,
<br>
the Halabja attack was *one of between 60 and 180 such attacks* that took
<br>
thousands of civilian lives.&quot;
<br>
<p>Note again the reference that this was one of up to 180 such attacks.
<br>
<p>The next response came from the executive director of Human Rights Watch
<br>
Kenneth Roth.  it reads:
<br>
<p>&quot;Stephen C. Pelletiere writes that Iran, not Iraq, might have been
<br>
responsible for the 1988 gassing of Kurdish civilians in Halabja.  Human
<br>
Rights Watch researchers interviewed survivors from Halabja and reviewed 18
<br>
tons of Iraqi state documents to establish beyond doubt that the attack was
<br>
carried out by Iraq. Iraqi forces used mustard and nerve gases, as well as
<br>
mass executions, to kill some 100,000 Kurds in the genocidal 1988 Anfal
<br>
campaign. The commander, Gen. Ali Hassan al-Majid, said of the Kurds, in a
<br>
taped speech obtained by Human Rights Watch: &quot;I will kill them all with
<br>
chemical weapons! Who is going to say anything? The international
<br>
community?&quot; The evidence is incontrovertible: Iraq is responsible for the
<br>
crime of genocide, committed against its own Kurdish population. The gassing
<br>
at Halabja was part of that crime&quot;
<br>
<p>The very site you linked for Pelletieres article has this link as a comment
<br>
(<a href="http://www.krg.org/reference/halabja/index.asp">http://www.krg.org/reference/halabja/index.asp</a>) These are the official
<br>
statements by the Kurdish Regional Government on the incident at Halabja.
<br>
It says:
<br>
<p>&quot;What happened in Halabja? On March 16th 1988, Iraqi jets bombed the town of
<br>
Halabja with chemical weapons.  At least 5,000 people were killed and 7,000
<br>
severely injured.  Fourteen years on, thousands are still suffering the
<br>
affects of the chemical weapons&quot;
<br>
<p>The Kurds, as I mentioned, seem to be no friend of the US, but are also
<br>
highly critical of Saddam (understandable, given his Anfal campaign was a
<br>
systematic effort to wipe them off the face of the Earth)
<br>
<p>For brevity, I would point you to only one more article.
<br>
(<a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2063934/">http://slate.msn.com/id/2063934/</a>)  This particluar article was written in
<br>
response to Jude Wanniski's incorrect parroting of Pelletiers argument.  It
<br>
is made clear that Pelletier only questions the involvement of Iraq in
<br>
Halajba in particular, note as mentioned before that more than a hundred
<br>
other gas attacks by Iraqi's on Kurds *also* occured, and even Pelletier
<br>
does not question these.  This article states:
<br>
<p>&quot;Last year, Pelletiere published a book (*) that Wanniski seems to think
<br>
argued that Iraq never gassed Iraqi citizens. But as one can plainly see by
<br>
scrolling down to the portion of Wanniski's memo (*) that quotes Pelletiere
<br>
at length, Pelletiere's claim is that in March 1988, both Iran and Iraq
<br>
gassed the Kurdish city of Halabja, which they were fighting over.
<br>
Pelletiere's view-which is not widely shared by others-is that the Iraqis
<br>
used mustard gas, while the Iranians used a much deadlier cyanide-based gas,
<br>
and that it was this cyanide gas that killed most or all of the thousands of
<br>
Kurdish civilians who died at Halabja&quot;
<br>
<p>And
<br>
<p>&quot;Joost Hiltermann of Human Rights Watch is writing a book about Halabja and
<br>
other incidents in which the Kurds were gassed. He says that he's seen no
<br>
evidence that Iran used chemical warfare during the Iran-Iraq war and plenty
<br>
of evidence that Iraq did. Much of the latter is available online. Here&quot;
<br>
<p>Additionally
<br>
<p>&quot;United Nations reports from 1986, 1987, and 1988 confirm (based in part on
<br>
reports from Iraqi soldiers who had been taken prisoner) that Iraq used
<br>
mustard gas and nerve agents in the Iran-Iraq war and that these killed a
<br>
growing number of civilians. In 1993, Physicians for Human Rights found
<br>
evidence (*) of nerve agents in soil samples in the Kurdish village of
<br>
Birjinni and cited Kurdish eyewitnesses who said that one day in August
<br>
1988, they saw Iraqi warplanes drop bombs emitting &quot;a plume of black, then
<br>
yellowish smoke&quot; and that shortly thereafter villagers &quot;began to have
<br>
trouble breathing, their eyes watered, their skin blistered, and many
<br>
vomited-some of whom died. All of these symptoms are consistent with a
<br>
poison gas attack.&quot; The March 24 New Yorker carries a lengthy account by
<br>
Jeffrey Goldberg (*) of Iraq's systematic gassing of the Kurdish population,
<br>
based on extensive eyewitness interviews that Goldberg recently conducted in
<br>
Halabja and other Kurdish-controlled areas in Northern Iraq. None of those
<br>
interviewed seem to doubt that it was Saddam Hussein's army that gassed
<br>
them&quot;
<br>
<p>(*) - links provided on source page
<br>
<p>Finally, for an additional commentary on the subject see -
<br>
(<a href="http://squawk.ca/lbo-talk/0204/0355.html">http://squawk.ca/lbo-talk/0204/0355.html</a>)
<br>
<p>In summary, the MTV News Byte Claim that &quot;Saddam Gassed his own people&quot; is
<br>
clearly still true.  There is some question about wheather Halabja was only
<br>
an attack by Saddam which intentionally targeting Kurdish civilians, with
