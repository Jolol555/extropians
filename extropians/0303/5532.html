<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; But that is exactly what FOX does! It's billed as neutral when it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; not. &quot;News without the spin,&quot; they say.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Untrue. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, not untrue at all. FOX probably promotes itself as unbiased at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once an hour. Have you ever spent a couple of days watching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; channel? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes. I generally have been watching it for war coverage only because it
<br>
is not filled with al Jazeera-like anti-American propaganda of varying
<br>
hues and levels of subtlety as is seen on CNN, NBC, MSNBC, and
<br>
elsewhere. I will fault all news channels for not presenting any
<br>
detailed representations of battle maneuvers, even after they occured.
<br>
All you ever see is a basic map of Iraq as a whole with stupid icons of
<br>
red and blue tanks, troops, planes, etc. On international and muslim
<br>
stations, all they show is US prisoners in Iraqi hands, alleged Iraqi
<br>
civilian victims of alleged US attacks, and Saddams &quot;Mother of all
<br>
battles&quot; type rhetoric about how badly the US is losing the war, the US
<br>
is retreating all the way to Bagdad...
<br>
<p>I have yet to see any station besides FOX even attempt to discuss what
<br>
is an is not a war crime and what the Geneva Conventions say, for
<br>
instance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not saying that FOX makes a secret of its intentionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right-winged biased editorials, but in general the network offers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost nothing from the &quot;other side.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, OReilly, who you hate, ALWAYS has the opposition on
<br>
for every issue debated. He simply doesn't tolerate horse-shit being
<br>
presented as fact. Like Joe Dees, late of this list, some individuals,
<br>
mostly liberals, can't function unless they are lying through their
<br>
teeth, and refuse to appear, claiming he is as you say.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Colmes (Hannity's supposed liberal nemesis) is anunphotogenic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncharismatic wimp who can barely articulate a clear sentence. He's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there just to serve as a placeholder and a punching bag. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Colmes is FOX's &quot;token liberal.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>Colmes makes me think of Skeletor, the evil Masters of the Universe
<br>
baddie. Both hosts have guests on from both sides of issues, and
<br>
depending on who the guest is, they take turns pillorying them with
<br>
tough questions. Hey, real journalism ISN'T Larry King Live (a CNN
<br>
program). Real journalism isn't &quot;The View&quot;. It isn't doing EVERY story
<br>
your program ever does on gun control come from a pro-control
<br>
viewpoint. It isn't producing a story which is so slanted that even
<br>
some liberals admit it (Morley Safer's 60 minutes piece on ballistic
<br>
fingerprinting)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CNN on the other hand offers some serious liberal opponents to debate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable conservative guys like Tucker Carlson. I happen to really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Tucker Carlson. And I also enjoy watching Carlson debate serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberals who know how to present an argument on &quot;Crossfire&quot;. Such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quality events never happen on FOX.
</em><br>
<p>If Max More's experience on Crossfire is representative of that show
<br>
(and it is) you are entirely wrong. I will say that of pundit shows,
<br>
Crossfire is the only one outside FOX that actually tries to present
<br>
both sides in a balanced way. Most other networks will present a
<br>
liberal as a &quot;Professor&quot; or &quot;noted expert&quot;, while presenting the
<br>
conservative as merely a member of some PAC or advocacy group, or else
<br>
they try to find the most extreme and un-presentable wingnut.
<br>
<p>I highly recommend Goldberg's book &quot;Bias&quot; to those who think it isn't
<br>
as bad in the rest of media.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding Neil Cavuto's scathing ad hominem attack on the professor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at FOX:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'll note here that you don't seem to be quoting anything the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; professor said in his letter to Cavuto. Such is evidence of bias.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Excuse me, Mike, but neither did Cavuto. I don't have any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about the professor's supposed letter. 
</em><br>
<p>Then you should have watched the show as it was originally broadcast. I
<br>
did, and Cavuto did, in fact, read the letter on the show.
<br>
<p>It ain't ad hominem if the best way to describe someone and their
<br>
opinions would seem insulting if applied to a moderate individual. Some
<br>
people just are as bad as they are described. Just like &quot;it ain't
<br>
bragging if you really done it.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am sure that if you called Satan the most vile evil creature in
<br>
existence (assuming you believed in its existence), some idiot would
<br>
claim you were making an ad hominem attack...
