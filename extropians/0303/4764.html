<p>
I am not really shure whether I should have labelled this post as IRAQ 
<br>
or WAR. But I actually do believe it is on topic, so I didn't. Sorry if 
<br>
I choose wrong.
<br>
<p>I cannot help but being somewhat amazed about the difference in power of 
<br>
the Iraqi and the coalition forces. It is probably many things that 
<br>
works together here, to make this difference.
<br>
<p>But it seems that all the high tech weaponry developed by the US makes 
<br>
an enourmeous difference in this war.
<br>
<p>And amazingly enough there dosn't seem to be any efficient counter 
<br>
meassures to these hightech weapons. At least not any that the Iraqis 
<br>
have been able to get their hands on.
<br>
<p>Ie. with laser guided precision bombs, it would seem obvious for the 
<br>
Iraqis to put up powerfull lasers pointing anywhere else than on 
<br>
important infrastructure, so as to confuse the guided bombs.
<br>
<p>And naturally air superiority is paramount, so the country ought to be 
<br>
massively packed with SAM's.
<br>
<p>This left mo wondering if all this is caused by the fact that the 
<br>
Iraqi's has been relatively isolated, and has no modern weapons anymore, 
<br>
or simply because there is a difference in weaponry that is rising 
<br>
exponentially?
<br>
<p>Then it could be a glimmer of what the singularity could be like.
<br>
<p>It is also a clear example on why it is important that these 
<br>
technologies belong to &quot;benign&quot; countries. But perhaps there is some 
<br>
kind of aoutomation in this, in that the free and rich countries are 
<br>
better able to develop advanced technology?
<br>
<p><p>The joker in this, is the rising power of the individual/small state due 
<br>
to even more advanced technologies (NABC - Nano, Atomic, Bio, Chem). But 
<br>
the best way to avoid individuals/small states being angry enough to use 
<br>
NABC's as a tool of terror, is to ensure wealth, freedom and democracy 
<br>
for as many people as possible.
<br>
<p>Should this lead to more preemptive strikes, to ensure freedom and 
<br>
democracy?
<br>
<p>Should we work even harder, and take more chances, to make shure that it 
<br>
is a rich and peacefull world before the technology get's to advanced?
<br>
