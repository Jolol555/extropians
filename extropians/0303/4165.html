<p>My apologies for the confusion, Mike. My snapshot extract did not convey
<br>
the full meaning of what he is saying. You need to read the full story
<br>
about the proposed Rights Management Services (RMS) to get it.
<br>
In the old days, when MS brought out a new document format, all the
<br>
other software packages swiftly updated their packages to read the new
<br>
format and MS issued programs like the free MS Word Viewer to enable
<br>
customers to read the new format documents.
<br>
This will happen no more.
<br>
RMS (which works with Windows Server 2003) issues a license certificate
<br>
containing access permissions when a document is created. So, in the
<br>
case of a Word document created in Office 2003, the person creating it
<br>
would use the &quot;permission&quot; button to set or restrict access. The process
<br>
accesses RMS, which encrypts the file and includes a license for
<br>
permissions.
<br>
In order to read an RMS protected document, the user has to access the
<br>
RMS server and get their license authenticated by the server.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, so the authors are disparaging Microsoft for doing something which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apple already did with it's OSX upgrade?
</em><br>
<p>He does get a bit anti-MS in places, but his main intent is to open
<br>
peoples' eyes to the future plans of MS. I find it difficult to see how
<br>
you can read this report and follow up some of the over a hundred links
<br>
he provides and not get a bit anti-MS yourself!
<br>
<p>Even if you do decide to go down the MS route at least you will have a
<br>
better idea of the considerable costs involved.
