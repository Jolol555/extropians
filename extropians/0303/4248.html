</em><br>
<p>Hmm, what would make anything an extropic value? As I see it, 
<br>
the thing would have to lead to greater personal extropy and 
<br>
possibly also greater extropy for others (I wouldn't use the 
<br>
term for something that decreased my extropy while helping 
<br>
others, or something that increased my extropy but decreased it 
<br>
for others). 
<br>
<p>Clearly helping out one's group can be such a win-win
<br>
situation: we get gratitude, reciprocal altruism, our shared
<br>
values are supported and so on. But how far can this group be
<br>
extended while still keeping it win-win? In some situations
<br>
this seems to be doable almost to any degree, like in science. 
<br>
But we are far more limited in other aspects. We are usually
<br>
happy to help family members and friends, relatively helpful to
<br>
people similar to ourselves or part of our community, less
<br>
supportive of remotely linked people and even less supportive
<br>
for people we do not know or feel we have any kinship (genetic,
<br>
social, mental) with. While I might agree with my close friends
<br>
to hire a brawny guy to protect us and our shared interests, in
<br>
a much larger group there is a diffusion of responsibility and
<br>
the marginal cost I am willing to pay for hiring protection
<br>
goes down. 
<br>
<p>I would say patriotism is the virtue of supporting and
<br>
promoting one's group, one's true patria, so to say. Clearly
<br>
extropian if it is reciprocal as above and the group is
<br>
something that could be called extropian. But that is separate
<br>
from the issue of where one draws the line around it (or even
<br>
how many groups one belongs to and how they are nested - am I a
<br>
transhumanist, a Swede, an European, an intellectual, a human
<br>
or person living in Hagalund foremost?). One common answer to 
<br>
that is that one should regard one's nation as one's primary 
<br>
group. That is what I would call nationalism. But as it is 
<br>
commonly stated it is not obviously extropian or even rational; 
<br>
nations can be defined in many arbitrary ways, are often very 
<br>
large groupings defined more by a shared administrative 
<br>
hegemony than any real similarity and the goals of the nation 
<br>
group are often not win-win with one's own goals. So my answer 
<br>
would be that in general, patriotism is extropian, but 
<br>
nationalism is not. 
<br>
<p>People with a more altruist bent might want to include even 
<br>
cooperation with one's group when one does not benefit but the 
<br>
group does. But the same reasoning seems to hold; unless there 
<br>
happens to be a congruence between one's own values and 
<br>
identifications and one's nation, nationalism doesn't seem 
<br>
extropic. 
<br>
<p>Of course, my definition of patriotism might be seen as too 
<br>
narrow. But the common definition that is more close to 
<br>
nationalism (&quot;Love of ones country; the passion which aims to 
<br>
serve ones country, either in defending it from invasion, or 
<br>
protecting its rights and maintaining its laws and institutions 
<br>
in vigor or purity&quot;) often simply seems to merge with it. I 
<br>
prefer to distinguish between the virtue of loyalty and how 
<br>
wide group gains this primary loyalty.
