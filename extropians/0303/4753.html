<p>Indeed, the humility lesson would be a plus. Good thought.

<p>That's right. It'd be damn difficult.

<p>Hmmm, this bought to mind this old story about AIDS in Africa:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;At the World Bank, an internal study found what South African 
<br>
economist Alan Whiteside ridiculed as a &quot;silver lining&quot; in the plague.
<br>
<p>&quot;If the only effect of the AIDS epidemic were to reduce the population 
<br>
growth rate, it would increase the growth rate of per capita income in 
<br>
any plausible economic model,&quot; said the June 1992 report by the bank's 
<br>
population and human resources department. Exactly that had happened in 
<br>
the 14th century, the report said, with the bubonic plague. The report 
<br>
did not conclude that AIDS would be a benefit to Africa, even in 
<br>
strictly economic terms, but it hardly marked a clarion call to action.
<br>
<p>&quot;Only the World Bank would put that on paper,&quot; Whiteside said.&gt;&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- <a href="http://tinyurl.com/7vih">http://tinyurl.com/7vih</a>
<br>
a.k.a. 
<br>
<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A47234-2000Jul4&amp;notFound=true">http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;node=&amp;contentId=A47234-2000Jul4&amp;notFound=true</a><br>
<p>Well, maybe the villagers might be less suspicious of the kids than the 
<br>
World Bank people. I was proposing contact that could be a little more 
<br>
direct and personal, and involve daily contact for years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A non-public remark of one villager
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to another might be, &quot;I understand that we are putting up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this silliness because somebody over there might send some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money, but shouldn't we be honest with the poor kids?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, I would hope such an education program would quickly disavow such 
<br>
a possible incentive. Such would give well-off classrooms a distinct 
<br>
advantage. Individual kids would be welcome to send their allowance, of 
<br>
course, but it should be made clear to the 'adopted' village that the 
<br>
program itself is not going to give them money. Just information and advice.
<br>
<p>And of course it's voluntary. Each village can decide for itself if it 
<br>
wishes to participate. Patience would be required of both the village 
<br>
and the schoolkids.
<br>
<p>The kids would have the advantage of time. They could spend all day 
<br>
(indeed, maybe every day of their entire schooling) working on things 
<br>
that might help the village. Possibly, they might plan out supply, 
<br>
distribution, and sharing networks that, while the villagers might be 
<br>
perfectly able to do for themselves, they simply don't have the time to 
<br>
research.
<br>
<p>Also, any positive memes that come out of this can be shared instantly 
<br>
with all the other adopter classrooms. No doubt getting the first 
<br>
village online with even minimal real contact would be a big hurdle. But 
<br>
young kids (perhaps boys especially) can be quite competitive. Perhaps a 
<br>
series of prizes would be an additional incentive when the going gets rough.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's what American kids need these days! More self-esteem!
</em><br>
<p>I agree, they need real self-esteem, built by a series of real 
<br>
acomplishments, rather than the fake self-esteem promoted in current US 
<br>
grade school education.
<br>
<p>I can see it maybe possible that the kids would be worse off if they 
<br>
failed utterly, but at least the lesson that nothing is simple would be 
<br>
reinforced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes! And with the skills the kids develop, they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; man the hotlines to resolve domestic disturbances,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intractable corporate mergers, and any number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflicts that periodically arise between groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and individuals.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're reaching, but it could happen. I'm sure there's lots of 
<br>
kids right now who are cowering by the railing at the top of the stairs 
<br>
listening to their parents screaming at each other, and having no idea 
<br>
whatsoever of what to do.
<br>
<p>Thanks for your positive suggestions,
<br>
