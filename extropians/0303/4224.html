Charles Hixson writes, regarding Microsoft's RMS technology:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The nifty thing is that since this is a device to control access, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DMCA would make illegal for people to build a device, say a competing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word processor, that could read the same format.   No just to use it on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own files, but even to design it.
</em><br>
<p>The DMCA is a very problematic law that gets in the way of many things
<br>
that should be allowed.  But from what I understand it, it does have an
<br>
exemption for reverse engineering for purposes of compatibility:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;REVERSE ENGINEERING... a person who has lawfully obtained the right
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to use a copy of a computer program may circumvent a technological
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measure that effectively controls access to a particular portion
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of that program for the sole purpose of identifying and analyzing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;those elements of the program that are necessary to achieve
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;interoperability of an independently created computer program with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;other programs...
<br>

<br>
<p>Of course IANAL and there may be some subtleties that I am overlooking,
<br>
but it appears that Congress intended there to be a loophole in the
<br>
DMCA for the specific purpose of reverse engineering for compatibility.
<br>
So the DMCA probably would not prevent the specific purpose Charles
<br>
describes above.
