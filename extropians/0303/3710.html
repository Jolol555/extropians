Dear all,
<br>
<p>I've been wondering on why are transhumanists so confident that we will 
<br>
reach the singularity. I'm about to finish my Ph.D. on the biology of aging 
<br>
and I've been thinking about the developments of the past few years, not 
<br>
just on aging but in other areas too. In truth, I'm disappointed with 
<br>
what's being done and I want to know why are transhumanists so confident we 
<br>
will reach the singularity. For instance, astrophysics and space 
<br>
exploration have been stagnating. It's been 30 years since a man walked on 
<br>
the moon and, though I'm not an expert, I don't see how our recent models 
<br>
of the universe--e.g. superstring theory--are more likely to be right than 
<br>
the models from Einstein's time. It's true breakthroughs have been made in 
<br>
biology and medicine, such as the Human Genome Project, but, shit, we 
<br>
haven't even cured AIDS, how can we expect to cure aging anytime soon? 
<br>
Also, I'm disappointed with the way science is made in the academia with 
<br>
personal egos rising above finding the mechanisms of aging. If we want to 
<br>
cure aging, we need to work together, but not many do that.
<br>
<p>In the end, I would say that the basis for the singularity is Moore's law, 
<br>
for it allows not only faster computers but also developments in DNA 
<br>
sequencing and a host of other possibilities. Yet I'm sure there are 
<br>
physical limits for Moore's law. When will we reach them? Can you be sure 
<br>
Moore's law will continue for long enough to develop a smarter-than-man 
<br>
artificial intelligence?
<br>
<p>When I found transhumanism, already several years ago, I thought it set an 
<br>
optimistic but plausible scenario. Now, I'm starting to wonder if we're not 
<br>
just another cult willing to sacrifice reality towards a fairer image of 
<br>
the world. Please prove me wrong. Or does anyone here thinks we're 
<br>
descendant from aliens?
<br>
<p>All the best.
