Sorry for my ninth posting today. I promise to stop now.

<p><em>&gt; I refused to return my draft card during the Vietnam war until my father
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (who had served in WWII) made it clear he would throw me out of the house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I did not do so.
</em><br>
<p>I am not familiar with the rituals of the US army. Is it correct to presume
<br>
that not returning your draft card meant to refuse service in Vietnam? So
<br>
your father as a WW2 veteran threatened to throw you out of the house if you
<br>
wanted to keep staying at his house?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People who promote &quot;peace at all costs&quot;
</em><br>
<p>If any mad dictator invaded your country I would help you without even
<br>
thinking twice. When the allies occupied Germany in WW2 it was a perfectly
<br>
justified step. The &quot;ethnic cleanings&quot; that Milosevic committed probably
<br>
justified the intervention of the Nato and Saddams atrocities also had been
<br>
worth another international intervention. Nothing wrong with that.
<br>
<p>But what I fear is that this war might be the first step towards a new world
<br>
order where the law of the strongest, i. e. USA reigns. To invade a country
<br>
that did not attack you is morally despisable. Of course a rational mind
<br>
like your's will always be able to find applications to justify this action,
<br>
but it seems to me that you Americans are now stewing in your own juice. The
<br>
whole world is shouting at you and you do not want to listen anymore - I am
<br>
fighting a lost cause here on this list but on the planetary scale you are
<br>
isolated ...oh yes, of course Britain and Spain and Italy and Albania and,
<br>
but in the case of Aznar and Berlusconi: they have the vast majority of
<br>
their people against them.
<br>
<p>I will not stop shouting, I am against THIS war. You are deadly wrong and
<br>
you should hear it again every day!
