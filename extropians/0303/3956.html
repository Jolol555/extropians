</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In retrospect, it seems incredible that we could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; see that this was very likely going to be the result.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee, the result was foreseen, the action was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentional.  Those who minister to those in need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetuate their existence by keeping people in need.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have read accounts of AID (Aid to Developing
<br>
Countries), the IMF, and World Bank, and so far have
<br>
not seen any evidence that they realized that they
<br>
were hurting the nations that they intended to help.
<br>
Especially at mid-century, they were under the spell
<br>
of Sovietism, and really believed that they needed to
<br>
go into all these countries and win the hearts of the
<br>
people to keep them from going Communist.
<br>
<p>They thought that land-reform (read expropriation and
<br>
destruction of property rights), and lots of money
<br>
(read confiscation by corrupt rulers into Swiss bank
<br>
accounts), and tons of free food (read further destruction
<br>
of the existing economy), all would really help.  They
<br>
simply didn't understand, and I guess practically NO ONE
<br>
did back then.
<br>
<p>But the corruption part---that's what's still unbelievable.
<br>
I mean, didn't the hard-nosed politicians from their home
<br>
countries tell them what was going to happen?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But the pressing question is still, what *can* be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; done in cases of famine?  Are we to just turn our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; backs?  (Unless you invade, what other option is there?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The answer is harsh, but no more so than the actions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have already been taken in the name of charity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The technically advanced must have the courage to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declare that all cultures are not truly equal, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some cultures really are better than others, and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology really does make for longer, healthier,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happier, better lives.
</em><br>
<p>I'm now starting to wonder if the culture is the worst
<br>
part of the problem.  For example, until this week I
<br>
believed that the Protestant Work ethic was something
<br>
real, but studies have shown that when equality before
<br>
the law and private property is guaranteed, there is no
<br>
difference between Catholics and Protestants at all.
<br>
(True: I still recall accounts that Protestants today
<br>
in Latin America are thriving---so I don't have the full
<br>
story on this, it appears.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nonviolent memetic warfare is called for.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  All that I know of that can be done is to remove
<br>
the blinders from everyone's eyes about collectivism and
<br>
corruption, and to cheer on Hernando De Soto and his allies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are we morally obligated to respect other's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cultures, religions and customs?  I argue that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not, that ideas want to be free.  Ideas will make their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way into closed cultures, and those cultures will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be turned upside down.  We cannot stop that, we do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to stop that.  The old ways will be overturned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No one can lock up any sizable piece of real estate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this planet for any one religion or custom.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can stop a radio wave.  No one can stop capitalism.
</em><br>
<p>True.  But so many problems remain.  In the countries of
<br>
southeast Asia, and also throughout Latin America, a tiny
<br>
percent of people form cliques that totally dominate their
<br>
economies---ethnically dominant minorities.  In Southeast
<br>
Asia, it's the Chinese, and they're resented everywhere.
<br>
In Latin America, it's the people with white skins that
<br>
run not only the economies, but have all the political
<br>
power as well.  What I would dearly love to know:  have
<br>
these economically dominant minorities written the laws
<br>
in such a way as to help keep them in control, i.e., to
<br>
deny equal protection?
