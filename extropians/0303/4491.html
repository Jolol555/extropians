<em>&gt; Hubert, If they were 'War Criminals' I wonder what you would propose doing

<em>&gt; people, or attacked a neighboring country, what would you propose the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, of course, what else? Remove him from power, bring him to Den Haag  and
<br>
sentence him to prison for the rest of his life. The WHOLE administration of
<br>
course that is responsible for the Iraq war. You all probably forgot that 40
<br>
% of the Iraq population are children. For every single dead child Bush
<br>
should be sentenced to livelong prison. I will gladly fly down and help
<br>
counting the bodies. Troubleyou Bush could be glad that the court in Den
<br>
Haag finds capital punishment as disgusting as I do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps the UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could present a resolution declaring that he must lose his capability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack other nations by some certain deadline,
</em><br>
<p>I know what you are trying to say. No nation or organisation is powerful
<br>
enough to remove an American President from power. YOU, the American people
<br>
must do it yourself. I certainly will come over as a militant pacifist and
<br>
help you. If you are a true patriot, you must stop these imbeciles from
<br>
bringing war to one country after another and depriving American citizens of
<br>
their freedom for a laughable shaky security with such planned laws as
<br>
Patriot Act
<br>
II. Anybody with a bit of life experience should know by now that there is
<br>
no such thing as security. Try to live with the rest risk. The Homeland
<br>
security laws are there to spred fear and paranoia among you and to let you
<br>
disappear with no right to make a phone call, if a neighbor - just for the
<br>
heck of it - denounces you of terrorist activities. This is truly deadly
<br>
evil and reminds me of the darkest period of my own country.
<br>
<p>I repeat it over and over again: I am NOT anti-American. And I hate Saddam.
<br>
I am just furiously against the small US political elite who thinks they are
<br>
God sent and are entitled to invade one unpopular country after the other.
<br>
This must be stopped before it really starts.
