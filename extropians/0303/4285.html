&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There you go again.  You try so hard to devastatingly witty.  But you 
<br>
can't get on point.  I wasn't trying to be witty.  I only wanted to tell the 
<br>
simple down home truth.  You like &quot;intellectual discussion quite a bit&quot; with 
<br>
those that agree with you.

<p>Ron,
<br>
<p>Put up an argument with some kind of substance (i.e. no personalized jabs) 
<br>
and I will be glad to continue the discussion. I'll debate with anyone who is 
<br>
interested and in fact I look forward to it. I'm sorry if you see someone 
<br>
trying to have a decent intelligent conversation as someone who is just 
<br>
&quot;trying to be devastatingly witty&quot;. I think you are confusing adroit command 
<br>
of the English language with simple arrogance (or simply 
<br>
'talking-down-to-ness'? I don't know, I'm no mind reader).
<br>
<p>Do you feel that way about others on this list? I find that many of the 
<br>
members have been quite eloquent and witty in past postings. 
<br>
<p>What exactly IS your version of the &quot;simple down home truth&quot; regarding the 
<br>
subject matter of the original posts? All I have been trying to do is get you 
<br>
&quot;on point&quot;. Unbelievable.
<br>
