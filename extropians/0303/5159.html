<p>
Though I have only been scanning the war threads to a limited
<br>
extent, I am puzzled why there does not seem to have been a
<br>
utilitarian/extropic calculation on when war may be justified.
<br>
<p>I'll assume for the moment that all human lives are equal
<br>
(of course this isn't accurate from an extropic perspective --
<br>
one Eric Drexler is likely to advance extropy much more than
<br>
one Iraqi laborer but we will make the assumption of equivalence
<br>
for the sake of the discussion).
<br>
<p>Saddam, according to a recent PBS special I viewed in the U.S.
<br>
is estimated to be responsible for ~190,000 deaths (separate
<br>
from war losses).  Assuming a regime of ~30 years that works
<br>
out to ~6000+ deaths per year.  Saddam was born in 1937, making
<br>
him 66, assuming he may have a life expectancy of another 10 years,
<br>
that means he will be responsible for the deaths of another 60,000
<br>
people.  Of course if he passes his regime onto one of his sons,
<br>
then we could envision this death toll as going on indefinitely.
<br>
<p>Will the death toll of the current war rise above 60,000?
<br>
I don't know.  Its clear that many Iraqis are caught between
<br>
a rock and a hard place (go out and get killed or we will
<br>
kill your children, your wife, and then you).
<br>
<p>But if one does nothing -- then can anyone on this list make
<br>
any kind of a reasonable argument that it is highly improbable
<br>
that 60,000 people will not die over the next decade due to
<br>
the continuation of Saddam's regime?
<br>
<p>Now -- pushing the extropic vector just a little bit further
<br>
what was the level of discussion on the list of the Rwanda
<br>
Massacres?  Or what is the discussion of the political
<br>
situation in Myanmar?  We seem to be woefully deficient in
<br>
a balanced discussion of &quot;causes of death&quot; that are unextropic.
<br>
<p>Now, getting onto Extropian Principle #7 &quot;Rational Thinking&quot;...
<br>
It is entirely irrational for the U.S. or the UK or Australia
<br>
to be sacrificing even a single life to save the life of an
<br>
Iraqi (assuming that the individuals in these countries have
<br>
a better education, better earning capabilities, etc. than
<br>
individuals in Iraq.)  The only argument that makes any sense
<br>
is that we are trying to uplift these individuals -- and that
<br>
we are willing to sacrifice ourselves in order to do so.
<br>
<p>It isn't a &quot;rational&quot; argument -- it is a human one.
<br>
<p>Robert
