<br>
<p>Thats the spirit Harvey.  {8-] The experiment was to post some
<br>
outrageous notion, knowing that I would be scolded.  Turns
<br>
out you guys already know me and so you know I was goofing,
<br>
but had I been an unknown, you would need to assume troll.
<br>
Then your posting in response to the troll would cause his
<br>
karma to go... up!
<br>
<p>Explanation: I have reverse engineered the karma parameter
<br>
on the archive profile page, and I think the negative number
<br>
represents the number of posts one has made to which no one
<br>
responded.
<br>
<p>I realized that we were confusing karma with whuffie, but
<br>
looking at the numbers and realizing that we currently have
<br>
no mechanism whereby we can express whuffie.  Karma is not
<br>
whuffie.  No one here has input any parameters of consensus
<br>
or lack thereof to any post.  Have you?
<br>
<p>OK, that being established, I realized that the script used
<br>
to calculate karma has only a few pieces of information.  It
<br>
can note when a new thread is started, by a new title.  Then
<br>
it can note if any responses are made.  It can note when a
<br>
post in the archives is opened.  But that is all it knows.
<br>
I postulated that the karma script awards a positive point
<br>
in the first number for each time a person's post is opened
<br>
from the archives, and evidently awards a negative point to
<br>
each time a person originates a thread to which no one
<br>
responds.
<br>
<p>To continue my experiment, I gave this post the intentionally
<br>
provocative subject line to see if it gets opened from the
<br>
archives a number of times.
<br>
<p>Whoever wrote the karma script, how close did I get?
