<p><em>&gt;German liberal teachers with peacful attitudes are merely self-serving &gt;isolationists who hate the US (oh! Never the people, only the &gt;government!) 
</em><br>
<p>From your last two letters I have the impression that it is *you* who hates *Germany* making such laughable comments as Joschka Fischer being a &quot;Braunhemd&quot; in a green disguise - for those who don't understand German, it means the brown shirts the Nazis wore as part of their uniform. If you called him a former leftist radical and would condemn him for that I would have no problems discussing that.Could it be while cherishing contempt for Germany you think that those who critizise the US must also *hate* America? 
<br>
<p>I can tell you: no country is worth hating it. I grew up with US culture and I am still very fond of a tiny part of US culture, but it costs enough energy to force back German mainstream politics and culture. So I do not have time or the least intention to let US mainstream culture and politics touch me on a level that entangles me so much as to feel hate. 
<br>
<p>Then you say that envy together with a feeling of superiority makes one looking for scapegoats. I have not achieved very much in my life. But one thing is for sure: I am glad that I don't suffer from envy. As I said the other day: I don't care if the US is the best in the world in all categories, they can always be the winner and work their ass off for it. I don't mind at all. But I am up the barricades if the US abuse their own feeling of superiority and start to perform and establish even territorially the Darwinian law of the strongest in the whole world.
