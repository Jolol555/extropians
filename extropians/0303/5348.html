<em>&gt; From: Anders Sandberg &lt;<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=Re:%20Spreading%20better%20memes%20(Re:%20Can%20Extropianism%20and%20Islam%20coexist?)">asa@nada.kth.se</a>&gt;, Sat, 15 Dec 2001:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; No need to coerce people, just give them a chance to convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; everybody that their memes are the best (according to some values)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on a free memetic market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see how it could be any other way. A human being has such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rich mix of philosophies, experiences, intellects, skills, desires, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prejudices, emotions, etc., that, in my opinion, all anyone can do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they want to 'teach' an idea in a nonacademic setting is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) be an example,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) 'plant seeds' for ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The notion of 'Converting a meme-set' is completely against my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics and as coersive as I can imagine. If you think of an idea as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a seed that germinates and grows, then either a person has the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal 'soil' where that seed will germinate, or he/she doesn't.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's very cool if they do take to it, but if the soil is not right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that idea then it's not right, and that's all. Find a way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present that idea (or 'be' that idea), and let it go. If that person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likes the idea then they'll return to you with questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So while I've been practicing the above for 20+ years, the Sufis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been practicing a much richer way to present ideas for 1000+
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years. Their way uses a presentation method which I call 'picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word concepts'. Even though the Sufis are a poor fit in a Moslem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mosque, they are a perfect fit in the Arabic language, and this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one of the most important reasons they have for choosing Arabic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as their primary language to express their concepts (as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand these people).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Sufis don't use *one* word to concisely present an idea, they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let the Arabic language concisely present an 'impression' via the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roots of a word. You start with a particular Arabic word, extract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the root, then generate/expand more words from the root. These
</em><br>
<em>&gt; special words with the  roots describe a complex set of ideas which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accord with a number of Sufi ideas and practices, and build up, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; close examination, a 'word picture'. With the meanings taken together,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the word carries a message or composite presentation of certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essentials. It extends the dimensions of meaning, through the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and its derivatives, and acts like an impression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, the Sufi traveler belongs to a 'tariqa'. This word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means: course, rule of life, order of dervishes. The nearest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approximation  to the sense of this word is 'way' in English, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way of doing a thing, the way upon which a person is traveling, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way as an individual. But there's much more meaning to this word for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Sufis.  The root is (TaRiQa). Now expand the TRQ root:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TaRQ = sound of a musical instrument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TaTaRRaQ Li = to aim at, to wish, to draw near to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ATRaQ = to remain silent with downcast eyes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TaRRaQ Li = to open the way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TaRaQ = to come to anyone by night
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TuRQaT  = way, road; method; habit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TaRIQAt = lofty palm tree
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So for the Sufis, the tariqa is the Path in which resides the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmission. It is a rule of living, a thin line within ordinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life, sometimes maintained through the note of music, expressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visually by the palm tree. The tariqa itself opens the Path, and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is connected with meditation, silent thinking, as when a man sits in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quiet contemplation in the silence of the darkness. It is both the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aim and the method.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So do you see how this 'scattering' method creates an whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impression on the disparate elements of the human mind?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it's lovely.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amara
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Sounds rather like Kabbalah (or however you want to spell it).  More 
<br>
specifically Gematria.  But its got a couple of problems.  The first is 
<br>
that it can't be translated.  The second is, that it may be largely 
<br>
introspective.  (Quaballah, at least, runs into many cases where things 
<br>
don't seem to be reasonable.  E.g., Serpent and Messiah share the same 
<br>
root, leading some to speculate that the serpent in the garden of Eden 
<br>
is the same and the redeemer-king to come.)
<br>
This doesn't mean it doesn't work.  A large part of the Quabbalistic 
<br>
work is resolving those problems.  And if you take it seriously, they 
<br>
are problems.  Seems somewhat similar to koans, a way of attacking the 
<br>
rooted beliefs.  With koans, at least, you don't even need to believe in 
<br>
the persuppositions of the system to benefit from it, if you can take 
<br>
the challenge seriously as a riddle.
