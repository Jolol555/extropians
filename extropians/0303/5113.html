<p>'Conjecture'. I didn't protest, but remain against this war. Since the 
<br>
war is now happening, I hope it ends as soon as possible with the 
<br>
minimum loss of life. I hope Saddam Hussein is removed from power and 
<br>
that some form of at least somewhat representative government takes root 
<br>
in Iraq. I conjecture your conjectured reaction is nowhere near 
<br>
inevitable in the majority of those opposed to this war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have no doubts that on this forum a few people do achieve

</em><br>
<p>On this point I have no doubt whatsoever that you can think of at least one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet even on this list we will find, were they to be honest
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; setbacks create a positive emotional affect. 
</em><br>
<p>Oh! If only we were honest with ourselves!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't really see any difference between American U.S. war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protesters---after hostilities have actually begun---and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; traitors. 
</em><br>
<p>So, people who dare to exercise their first ammendment rights are 
<br>
'traitors'. Personally, I would consider persons who spit on the 
<br>
constitution, the document our soldiers and leaders are sworn to uphold, 
<br>
to be 'traitors'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any lengthening of the war will be accompanied by positive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotions by those who are against the Coalition, not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the political damage that they calculate accrues to the Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regime,
</em><br>
<p>Given your logic, a series of quick victorious wars (perhaps against 
<br>
Syria, Iran, etc) will enhance the Bush administration and certainly 
<br>
lead to a re-election. Oh boy!
<br>
<p>Lee, why don't you write a book? Call it 'Ascension to Godhood'. Early 
<br>
hypothetical conjectures about the nature of man and the universe would 
<br>
lead to illuminating analysis of folks who think different than you, 
<br>
followed by the condemnation of everything not-you. Then, standing 
<br>
outside of time and space, you conclude with a series of transcendental 
<br>
aphorisms that prove (by your own logic) that your Ascension is 
<br>
complete. I'd buy it (after it comes out in paperback, at a used book sale).
