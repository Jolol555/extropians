Lee and I were talking about Patriot Act II and he said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But it is *not* my own personal safety that I am concerned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with.  Suppose that anyone I knew or had heard of was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being arrested for their opinions.  That would be completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt;different!
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not for their opinions, but just for a suspicion. Image you happen to
<br>
sit at the same table in a restaurant with an Al Quaida supporter who is
<br>
under surveillance - a complete stranger to you. Then he asks you if you can
<br>
change his five dollar note. You exchange some polite and friendly words and
<br>
you push five bucks over the table and he gives you something the observers
<br>
cannot identify. Next thing you see is a red suit they have put you in and
<br>
your hands tied to the back in a cage at Guantanamo Bay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Just imagine a revengeful neighbor denounces you....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ... I can't do nothing to convince you.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Hubert, I am very disappointed that you did not choose to discuss
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any specific with me.  Evidently, you read through the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ACLU criticism of the Patriot Act, and you just got a bad &quot;feeling&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>My main source was an interview, the German news magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; did
<br>
with one ACLU activist. The URL of the ACLU I provided I ordered from this
<br>
wise old man called Mr. Google. And I read this page only cursorily and
<br>
thought it was sufficient for a first impression about Patriot Act II.
<br>
<p>As you probably know: &quot;I am not a lawyer&quot;, so as a layman I depend on
<br>
someone who is able to really penetrate a topic and interpret the stiff
<br>
words of a law draft, tell me the real implications. I tend to believe that
<br>
the journalists at &quot;Spiegel&quot; are doing a very fine job, though of course
<br>
they are biased in some way, too.
<br>
<p>But here I can read it in German and do not have to look up every third
<br>
legal term in order to approximately understand what it is all about. So I
<br>
have to rely on the words of the ACLU people the journalists have talked to.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why won't you look through it again, and the first time that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you find something *concrete*, please tell me.  (Or, preferably,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;why don't you find the most alarming thing?)
</em><br>
<p>As I said before. Lee, I do not have more information at hand than these
<br>
guys at ACLU can provide. So, if you have looked through the draft and did
<br>
not find anything alarming, it is fine. I can't do anything to convince you
<br>
of the dangers your country is facing if such a law should be enforced. The
<br>
lights in your tunnel are still on while the lights in my reality tunnel are
<br>
flickering violently. You still feel calm while I am alarmed. But maybe your
<br>
lights still shine brightly only because you have no chance to hear that
<br>
American citizens suspicious of supporting apparent terrorist organisations
<br>
have already secretly been captured - no misunderstandings,
<br>
please...probably
<br>
not right now but in future scenarios where PA II would be common law.
<br>
<p>They are denied American citizenship and are thrown into some fine Cuban
<br>
cages or into Egyptian prisons where the US has deals with the Government
<br>
and therefore has no need to grant them the legal US rights. This could be
<br>
one of the main instruments of future Government terrorism. They can let you
<br>
disappear as a stateless person and you have no right to make your phone
<br>
call. And then the first steps to fascism are taken. Remember, Nazi Germany
<br>
started from a democracy where Adolf Schittelgruber was elected legally -
<br>
even with no help from some southern state where the votes had to be
<br>
recounted.
<br>
<p>Of course I am biased just like anybody else. I grew up with loads of
<br>
stories of denunciations in the Nazi era where jealous and mean people
<br>
denounced their neighbors for virtually nothing. My mother could walk though
<br>
town with me and point at this man and that woman and say: these are
<br>
informers who are responsible of the death of innocent people
<br>
<p>Here is a translated paragraph from the &quot;Spiegel&quot; article:
<br>
<a href="http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,238801,00.html">http://www.spiegel.de/politik/ausland/0,1518,238801,00.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;What makes Patriot Act II questionable in the eyes of legal experts is the
<br>
utterly unclear definition of a terrorist organisation. If it pleases the
<br>
Government even militant animal right fighters can be defined as terrorists.
<br>
Their members could even be affected by the extension  of capital
<br>
punishment. If for example during a protest march a non-participating
<br>
passer-by dies by force, capital punishment is applicable to the
<br>
demonstrants.&quot;
<br>
<p>Have a nice day
<br>
