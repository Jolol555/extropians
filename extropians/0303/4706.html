&quot;The &quot;leftists&quot; on this list are largely intelligent and Extropian
<br>
individuals
<br>
with whom I disagree on a number of issues sometimes for subtle and
<br>
complicated reasons that have more to do with information theory than
<br>
whether
<br>
or not they &quot;love America&quot; or &quot;love Freedom&quot;.
<br>
<p>The pseudo-libertarians who fill this list with liberal-baiting, childish,
<br>
ad-hominem insults are interfering with the spread and evolution of
<br>
libertarian memes. They are like Revolutionary Workers League moles
<br>
infiltrating real activist groups or Scientologist moles infiltrating damn
<br>
near anything they can.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ah, so every one that you mostly agree with is intelligent and extropian,
<br>
but everyone who mostly disagrees with you is childish and will resort to
<br>
nothing but ad-hominem insults.  But wait, is calling someone childish an
<br>
ad-hominem?  Or can it *gasp* be possible that many people on this list,
<br>
from differing backgrounds, are intelligent, and can legitimately come to
<br>
differing opinions on subjects? (back to the whole can we work out
<br>
disagreements thread) I would also add that 'libertarian memes' (which ones?
<br>
all of them?) have yet to be proven objectively to be the best memes on
<br>
every subject, and as such 'interfering with their spread' may or may not be
<br>
a good thing.  For the record, I am a registered libertarian.
