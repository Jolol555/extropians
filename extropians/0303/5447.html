..Like out of a good sci-fi novel. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Story location: <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,58103,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,58103,00.html</A>

<br>
<p>LAS VEGAS -- At MGM Grand's Tabu nightclub there's a lot more than Bruce 
<br>
Willis dancing on the table tops. 
<br>
<p>The club -- where the action flick star has been spotted -- is test-driving a 
<br>
revolutionary technology in which images displayed on table tops change in 
<br>
reaction to motion that occurs above them. 
<br>
<p>Wave a hand above a black-and-white image of a woman's pursed lips on the 
<br>
table top and the area below your hand turns to color. Other tables appear 
<br>
littered with dozens of paper clips that scatter to other parts of the 
<br>
surface when an object passes over them. Yet another table is decorated with 
<br>
a fairly plain motif, until an item -- say, a drink -- is placed on it. At 
<br>
that, a Lord of the Rings-style circle of fire surrounds the object. 
<br>
<p>This &quot;motion-reactive&quot; technology, developed by San Carlos, California, &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.reactrix.com/">http://www.reactrix.com/</a>&quot;&gt;
<br>
Reactrix Systems&lt;/A&gt; is likely to soon become much more than mere entertainment. 
<br>
At Tabu, it's a gimmick to wow club-goers, but both 20th Century Fox and Toys 
<br>
R Us are already testing it as a way to advertise their products. 
<br>
<p>The movie studio tried it at malls in Los Angeles and near San Francisco from 
<br>
November to February to promote the film Daredevil. Folks could, for 
<br>
instance, wave across an image of star Ben Affleck as attorney Matt Murdock 
<br>
to transform him into his superhero character. 
<br>
<p>At the flagship Toys R Us store in New York City's Times Square, a Reactrix 
<br>
display pushes a variety of name-brand toys. In one instance, a racetrack 
<br>
oval is projected and revolving around it are logos for Sony PlayStation 2, 
<br>
Microsoft Xbox and Nintendo Game Cube. If someone places a hand across the 
<br>
oval, the logos stop at the &quot;obstruction&quot; and back up on each other until the 
<br>
path is cleared. 
<br>
<p>It could be the first step toward the sort of interactive advertising 
<br>
imagined in the futuristic film Minority Report, where a Gap ad recognizes 
<br>
Tom Cruise's character in a mall and asks him how he's enjoying his recent 
<br>
purchase. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This has the impact of television with the involvement of a video game and 
<br>
the proximity to the point-of-purchase of an in-store display,&quot; said 
<br>
29-year-old Reactrix CEO and co-founder John Friedberg. &quot;TV is a high-impact 
<br>
advertising medium, but when that viewer walks into the store a few days 
<br>
later, the message isn't really fresh in the person's mind. In a store like 
<br>
Toys R Us, people play with the interactivity right where they can buy the 
<br>
product.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The intrigue for users is as much in wondering what the interactive display 
<br>
will do as in wondering how it works. Friedberg said sensors in the 
<br>
projectors pick up motion between it and the image and can respond with an 
<br>
infinite number of possible changes. The premise was designed by Reactrix 
<br>
co-founder, 23-year-old Matt Bell, who developed the basic technology as a 
<br>
computer science undergraduate at Stanford University. He graduated in 2001. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The computer sees where a person's location is in a display and triggers 
<br>
interactivity within the graphics,&quot; Friedberg explained. &quot;It detects a 
<br>
person's movement and uses that to affect the imagery.&quot; 
<br>
<p>At MGM Grand, the two Tabu displays are a hit. The images are projected onto 
<br>
4.5-square-foot, gray concrete tables upon which Willis has reportedly 
<br>
danced. The images have been reacting since the lounge's late-February 
<br>
opening. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It's a marketing tool that we've converted into an entertainment 
<br>
experience,&quot; said Greg LeTourneau, MGM Grand Hotel-Casino executive technical 
<br>
director. &quot;It's goofy, and it drives everybody nuts.&quot; &gt;&gt;
