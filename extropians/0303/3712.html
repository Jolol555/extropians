special intellect of human; a throw-forward for the species? I am too un-wise

to make such a judgement. As to whether &quot;we&quot; will change, I have no 
<br>
confidence in. As to what we believe in, how we govern ourselves, how we

create wealth; I would say that yes, these things must evolve to keep pace 
<br>
with change, to adapt to new discoveries. etc.
<br>
<p>Mitch,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could easily be argued that I don't truly understand Buffet as I am 
<br>
not also a billionaire.  But I have studied him intensively over the past 
<br>
several years and his appears to be theoretically the simplest of all the 
<br>
theorys.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My basic point was about pulling our dreams down to Earth and actually 
<br>
doing something to realise them.  If we operate at a level where we have to 
<br>
go to the government, etc. to pay for our dreams then we are operating at the 
<br>
wrong level.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look at George Bush our current President.  I don't dislike the man.  
<br>
I voted for him.  Still, there are many people on this list that are 
<br>
technically better qualified to make decisions about science than President 
<br>
Bush but who is going to make the important decisions -- Mr. Bush will do so. 
<br>
&nbsp;Why is this so?  The answer is power.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perhaps I am misinformed but I have been led to believe that many of 
<br>
those decisions could be taken out of his hands were we of a mind set to do 
<br>
so or if we had prepared ourselves by having accumulated the personal power 
<br>
to do so.
<br>
