Good comments, especially with regard to Iain Banks, though he takes things
<br>
further than Banks. However as to reviewers...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Several reviewers have complained about the style.  It's a little rough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and old-fashioned, but I enjoyed it.  There are several hilariously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funny scenes that help to puncture some of the pomposity.
</em><br>
<p>Peter Hamilton, Alastair Reynolds - in literary terms, these guys are the
<br>
hacks, with wooden characters and frayed plotlines and complete lack of
<br>
finesse about emotional issues dealing with violence.
<br>
<p>Wright is closer to the better parts of &quot;Radix&quot;, a fabulous novel even if
<br>
sections are written like Peter Hamilton. Some of Wright's style draws upon
<br>
the bulk of human history, which is aristocratic in aesthetic and not
<br>
idiomatic or slang-orientated. Perhaps in some ways it bears similarity to
<br>
Gene Wolfe.

Subject: The Golden Age by John C. Wright
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Several people have mentioned the novel The Golden Age, by John C. Wright.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read this a couple of months ago and am re-reading it now.  It's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrific novel and I'm enjoying it even more the second time through,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I see more clearly how Wright's future society works and has evolved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the TOR Books web site, the sequel, The Phoenix Exultant,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be published in April, which is also when The Golden Age should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appear in paperback.  I did see a claim online that the second book got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too long and the series will now be a trilogy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien pointed last year to this interview with the author, a colorful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and curmudgeonly sort (warning, contains some spoilers):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.sfsite.com/05a/jcw127.htm">http://www.sfsite.com/05a/jcw127.htm</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I like best about the book is the variety shown in Wright's future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society, the Golden Oecumene (oecumene means world in greek/roman).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The big problem in any non-fantasy future story these days is how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; handle super-intelligence.  We can't appreciate a story in which there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are nothing but super-human beings.  So we have to focus on possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; futures in which there are some recognizable humans.  Then you need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain why these people still exist given the existence of superhumans.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Basically what Wright has done is to show a possible variant on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eliezer's &quot;Friendly AI&quot; scenario.  Humanity is shepherded and guarded by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-intelligent AIs, the Sophotechs.  These beings take a relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; passive role in human society, primarily acting as guides and aides.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They give advice, they run the virtual and augmented realities;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occasionally they invent things.  But what they also do, although it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not depicted directly in the story, is prevent violence.  No one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hurt or physically coerce anyone else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In short, the Golden Oecumene is a libertarian utopia.  It used to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that when you joined the Libertarian Party you had to sign this little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; card saying something like &quot;I promise not to use coercion on anyone else.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the Golden Oecumene, this is the primary law.  No one can be coerced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Everyone has complete freedom as long as they don't harm anyone but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we see in the novel is the working-out of this principle as applied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a world in which alterations to the mind and its perceptions can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be achieved almost without limit.  In fact this is to some extent a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;travelogue&quot; novel, meaning one whose interest flows from the setting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenery more than the plot.  But in this case, the tour is of mentality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than of physical space.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We've got the space elevator, terraformed planets, massive engineering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; projects, but they aren't that interesting.  Where Wright is dazzling is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in presenting the range of human mental (and to some extent, physical)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adaptations and variations.  There are half a dozen different mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations which are described in considerable detail: the Vulcan-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Invariants; the Warlocks, who walk through a waking dream; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Compositions, group minds; the Sophotechs, the super-intelligent AIs; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Neptunians, who have rejected the Oecumenical principles of non-coercion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and whose super-cold organic brains approach Sophotech powers; and more.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Add to this the capability of individuals to alter their brains,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their motivations and perceptions, as easily as we change our clothes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a tremendous power, but extremely dangerous.  A single rash act
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can put you on the path to mental self-destruction; and there can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no intervention, nothing stronger than verbal persuasion is allowed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to try to rescue someone who has made such a mistake.  We see several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cases where good, strong people have destroyed themselves in this way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ultimate freedom is the freedom to be wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a good, philosophical book that faces these issues squarely.  As in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any real utopia, a substantial part of the population hates their society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We hear their voices as well.  What meaning is there for life in a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where anything a human can do, a machine can do better?  It's a tough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem but it's one our descendants (and perhaps even we ourselves)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may have to deal with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Several reviewers have complained about the style.  It's a little rough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and old-fashioned, but I enjoyed it.  There are several hilariously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funny scenes that help to puncture some of the pomposity.  Also, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-reading the book it is clear that the main action of the story is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually a distraction which is covering up the important event that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really happening, which will presumably be the topic of the next book(s).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's interesting to compare Wright's society with Banks' Culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both have augmented humans side-by-side with super-intelligent AIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Culture is a socialist/communist utopia while the Golden Oecumene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a libertarian one.  Both societies are fundamentally decadent by our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standards; both have strong threads of internal discontent.  I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in particular of Banks' recent Look to Windward as a good comparison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for The Golden Age.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll wrap this up with some notes that might be of interest to others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have read the book.  I've been going through and working out Wright's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chronology, the history of the Golden Oecumene, as I re-read the novel.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He leaks out bits and pieces here and there, and by playing detective I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have come up with a relatively coherent picture.  I haven't finished my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; second run-through but here is how I see things so far.  I'll put in some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spoiler space for the benefit of those who haven't yet read the novel.

<em>&gt; Wright's characters describe history in terms of eras called Mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Structures.  They are presently in the Seventh Mental Structure, aka
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Golden Oecumene (&quot;golden age&quot;).  Here is my reconstruction of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earlier eras and their defining events:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First Mental Structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Primitive hunter-gatherers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second Mental Structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Age of agriculture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third Mental Structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Industrial Revolution. We are in the late Third Mental Structure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fourth Mental Structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Contrary to most of today's expectations, the Fourth Mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Structure is not about AIs.  Rather, it is the age of the group
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minds. It started with the First-Harmony Composition, whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waking to self-awareness defined the beginning of the Fourth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mental Structure.  During this era, individual consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost died out.  The Compositions offered a form of immortality,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as minds who joined were remembered forever.  The Fourth Mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Structure was an eons-long era of peace.  It was during this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time that at least some of the new neuroforms were developed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly the Warlock and probably the Invariant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fifth Mental Structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Fifth Mental Structure was a long period of chaos, beginning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when the Bellipotent Corporation re-invented murder and war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Bellipotents apparently engaged in warfare against Warlocks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and rapid advances in personal weaponry ensued.  It was during
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this era that the Eleemosynary Composition was founded which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; became one of the greatest and most powerful group minds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It ruled at least all of Asia and possibly the whole world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sixth Mental Structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Sixth Mental Structure was defined by the dawning of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; machine minds, the Sophotechs. The Eleemosynary Composition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; played an important part in the development of this AI technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The age of warfare was over as the Sophotechs imposed their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benevolent rule on humans, forbidding violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seventh Mental Structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Seventh Mental Structure dates from the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noumenal recording technology, which at last allowed true,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual immortality.  The power of the group minds went into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decline as people preferred the idea of not dying over being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well remembered.  This defines the current political/mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; configuration of the Golden Oecumene.  There are some indications
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the story occurs approximately 10000 years after the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning of this era.
