<br>
<p>Neil Cavuto &quot;wears his bias on his sleeve.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, he is quite open about giving his opinion and when he does so it is
<br>
clearly not hard news, it is a debate. As I said before Fox makes no secret
<br>
of what side of the debate they are on, they hope the American side wins.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Neil Cavuto:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So am I slanted and biased? You damn well bet, professor
</em><br>
<p>It's apparent to me that Cavuto was telling the truth when he said that, so
<br>
what's your problem?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;In less than a minute, Neil Cavuto managed to call this professor a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;pontificating jerk,&quot; a &quot;callous elitist,&quot; a &quot;self-absorbed condescending
</em><br>
<em>&gt;imbecile,&quot; a &quot;lie and fraud and an ingrate,&quot; an &quot;intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Lilliputian,&quot;  who is &quot;clueless&quot; and &quot;selfish&quot; and who has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;ice running through his veins.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Ok, I accept that Cavuto said that, but to complete your prosecution you now
<br>
need to show me that what he said was incorrect. I didn't see the debate you
<br>
are referring to but I have seen professors who would fit that description
<br>
to a tee.
