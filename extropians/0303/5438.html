<p>I took it for granted that just about every country besides Israel opposed the
<br>
war, at a popular level.  I thought Eastern Europe might be exceptions, but
<br>
then I found I was wrong.  I knew that Blair and Howard were bucking their
<br>
populations.  But it's good to fact check.  So:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/30/1048962645495.html">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/30/1048962645495.html</a>
<br>
<p>90% of Spaniards and French oppose the war.  And the Spanish government is one
<br>
of our allies.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/30/1048962645191.html">http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/30/1048962645191.html</a>
<br>
suggests the published &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; is misleading.
<br>
<p><a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;ncid=578&amp;e=8&amp;cid=578&amp;u=/nm/20030330/ts_nm/iraq_usa_poll_dc">http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;ncid=578&amp;e=8&amp;cid=578&amp;u=/nm/20030330/ts_nm/iraq_usa_poll_dc</a><br>
says Americans think the gov't was overly optimistic in war predictions, that
<br>
the war will probably last months, and that 5,000 American *or* 500 Iraqi
<br>
casualties is too many.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45187-2003Mar28.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45187-2003Mar28.html</a>
<br>
says support in Britain was 37% (probably higher now due to the
<br>
rally-behind-our-troops effect) and that support in Europe never topped 30%.
<br>
And population-wise Europe is most of the developed world outside of the US.
<br>
(US 280m, EU 320m, Japan 150m? Canada 30m...)
<br>
<p>Ah, further on it says British support is 56%... which is really low for a
<br>
democracy at war.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s819650.htm">http://www.abc.net.au/news/newsitems/s819650.htm</a>
<br>
says 78% in France oppose, and &quot;overwhelming majorities&quot; in Spain, Portugal,
<br>
and Italy.
<br>
<p>In Germany, of course, Schroeder was elected on anti-war sentiment.
<br>
<p>As for the heavy burdens bit we've been bearing alone, what do you have in
<br>
mind?  The Cold War?  Europe supported us there.  WW II?  We were hardly alone
<br>
in that.  What, really?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And I do realize sometimes we do make mistakes, but if we play our cards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right this will not be one of them.  The U.S. (yes, and even European
</em><br>
<p>Big 'if', it seems to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; except when repelling an invasion.  But it's unethical (just plain wrong!)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the U.S. to standby while Saddam every year terrorizes, tortures, rapes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and murders his own citizens.
</em><br>
<p>We can't even stop prison rape in the US, but we're going to war to stop it
<br>
elsewhere?
