<p>I would certainly be interested to hear what extropians think of Patents (at
<br>
least, mechanical innovation patents)  There is a large portion of
<br>
libertarians here, and I generally consider myself one (a 'neo'-libertarian
<br>
I guess to be more accurate) but I do not see much value in the arguments
<br>
against IP.  They seem to center around 'see, there has been plenty of
<br>
innovation without patents, the wheel, steam engines, etc'  to which I would
<br>
respond 'yeah, but those took thousands of years to come about'  
<br>
<p>It seems to me so accurate to assume that patents spur innovation for the
<br>
sake of innovation alone, as opposed to necessity innovation.  Imagine a
<br>
middle ages feudal lord who gave 10 acres to anything that a peasant
<br>
invented that he considered directly valuable to the lands?  Which meant
<br>
that instead of people happening to come across good ideas, here was a cash
<br>
prize waiting for a good idea.  So people would actively pursue and think
<br>
about what could be a good idea.  This seems so much more efficient at
<br>
generating innovation that a mere necessity based system.   
<br>
<p>Additionally, it seems to me that a parallel can be drawn to the common
<br>
argument against communism, that not rewarding a worker gives them no desire
<br>
to excel.  Sure some people who love to be doctors would slave for years in
<br>
schools to be a doctor, only to get the pay of a garbage man, but capitalism
<br>
dictates the rewards for efforts based on the demand, so if there are not
<br>
enough Doctors around, they would start making more, and more people who
<br>
otherwise would have been content as garbage men train to become doctors.
<br>
(Not to put down sanitation workers, their efforts are easily as valuable in
<br>
some sense, considering the diseases that can come from poor sanitary
<br>
conditions)  
<br>
<p>Similarly, sure some innovations will come about without IP, but no where
<br>
near as many as would with it, since it gives people incentive to be
<br>
inventive for the pure reason of inventing.
<br>
<p>And its also important to note the value of IP in medicine, would
<br>
pharmacuetical companies really invest 400 million dollars to make a first
<br>
pill only to have everyone else start making them for a buck a piece?  I
<br>
doubt it.
