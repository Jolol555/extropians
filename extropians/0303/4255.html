<em>&gt; Hmm

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm part way into chapter 4 of Doctorow's book, but so far I haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really noticed - especially in the lead characters, how the desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accumulate whuffie might be characterized as a 'mechanism for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior extortion'.
</em><br>
<p>While I haven't read Doctorow's book, I am commenting on reputation
<br>
karma systems in general, not on your or Doctorow's systems
<br>
specifically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The only example that springs to mind is when Lil wrinkles up here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nose when she learns that the notorious Keep-A-Movin' Dan, in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state of depression, has shamefully allowed his whuffie to piddle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away to nothing. But even so,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she's still awfully nice in offering him a place to stay while he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets back on his feet, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps I'm missing some huge forest for the trees, or maybe what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're indicating develops later in the story?
</em><br>
<p>Don't know if it develops in the story, but it seems to me that the
<br>
whole whuffie economy is based on an enticement for people to behave
<br>
the way others want them to behave and not according to their own true
<br>
natures. It is peer to peer consensual fascism. Reminds me much of the
<br>
society of Brave New World.

<br>
<em>&gt; Anyhow why on Earth do you appear to be defending Gina to myself--the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only person on the list (so far as I know) who has effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered her a free professional service in exchange for prior news-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gathering excellence?
</em><br>
<p>My post was not meant as an attack on you personally, though I can see
<br>
how it could be taken as such. You have my apologies for any offense
<br>
taken.
<br>
<p>My comment about Gina is that I hold her in high esteem as well, and
<br>
given some somewhat recent negative life experiences of hers, she
<br>
certainly deserves the support of all of us for the great job she is
<br>
doing. Given my lack of online financial resources these days, I would
<br>
like to give her my whuffie that I have apparently earned from you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not to suggest I disagree with anything you wrote above, but you must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be having a bad hair day or something.
</em><br>
<p>Given the increasing lack of hair on my scalp, the possibility of any
<br>
kind of a hair day, good or bad, is getting scarcer and scarcer. Gina
<br>
certainly has far more use of my whuffie in services from you than I
<br>
do... ;)
