<em>&gt; &gt;Would it be fair to characterise your position as being scornful

<em>&gt; &gt; not just of international law them but of law generally?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No not at all, I obey most laws even laws I don't like because

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;But perhaps with some extra contempt for international law?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have contempt for international law and who knows 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someday it might actually exist but it doesn't now. I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contempt for the international suggestions that do actually exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either, in fact some of  them are quite wise but laws they are not.
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand John. Do you doubt that the UN Charter exists
<br>
and has been signed (and ratified) by the United States and other
<br>
member nations? Or are you saying, as I think you are, that it does
<br>
exist but that it is not international law? 
<br>
<p>According to the UN Charter, the USA actually holds the signed
<br>
documents. The papers that are the ratified original documents.
<br>
<p>Lets say for the moment that you did agree that such did exist.
<br>
<p>Lets also say that other people were widely referring to the
<br>
mutual obligations that the respective signatories had accepted by
<br>
signing on behalf of their countries by the phrase &quot;international law&quot;.
<br>
Would you still hold that international law did not exist. Even if say 
<br>
President Bush and a whole bunch of other US authorities said that
<br>
it did?
<br>
<p>I haven't checked yet but I reckon Google could probably find us
<br>
some pretty good evidence that both (a) &quot;international law&quot; has
<br>
meaning as a phrase - ie. it is generally an understood and used 
<br>
term and (b) that authorities in the US also used the term. I.e. 
<br>
They also agreed that &quot;international law&quot; is an appropriate and
<br>
meaningful term to decribe such things as the UN Charter and 
<br>
Geneva conventions.
<br>
<p>But would that be enough evidence to satisfy you that international 
<br>
law did exist and that you were mistaken to think it did not?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(Aside: I am reminded of a story of a hyper sceptic who doubted 
<br>
everything and would only wiggle his little finger to indicate that he
<br>
thought he had heard a question but was not even sufficiently sure
<br>
that it was sensible and meaningful enough to warrant answering?) 
<br>
<p>I'm trying to understand what evidence if any would be sufficient
<br>
for you to change your mind. Is your current opinion in any way 
<br>
a falsifiable hypothesis to you?
<br>
<p>I haven't had a chance to check out the rest of your post yet
<br>
but perhaps this is sensible place to fork the thread. After
<br>
all the existence of international law or otherwise would seem
<br>
to be pretty important and pretty objectively determinable.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett  Paatsch
