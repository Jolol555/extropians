<em>&gt; &gt; Thus anthropic reasoning predicts that we should

</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do not. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, there is a flaw in the process of anthropic reasoning. The Anthropic
<br>
Principle says so! We cannot derive any probabilities about the likelihood
<br>
of our existence based on the fact that we exist; no matter how unlikely &amp;
<br>
uncommon it is for life to develop, we are it, and wont know any different.
<br>
It's elementary stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This bugs me, and statements of this sort have always bugged 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me. I think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm wary of it as a possible misapplication of what is often 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called &quot;the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law of large numbers&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that saying things like &quot;we should&quot; rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more like &quot;out of /x/ trials, a civilization was seen in /y/ cases to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possess property /w/, with a variation /z/ across trial sets, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability P&quot; is a huge palming-of-a-card, possibly itself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a quasi- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anthropic way. Akin to the claim (a loaded one, but easy to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come by) that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because x-ethnicity is usually in jail, I &quot;ought to be&quot; in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jail because I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am x-ethnicity.
</em><br>
<p>By the same thinking, we should all be third worlders, because they are the
<br>
vast majority of the population of the planet. But we aren't, because we are
<br>
damned lucky SOBs. Each of us only rolls the dice once, not 6 billion times;
<br>
we can beat the house. Same for entire species, and entire worlds.
