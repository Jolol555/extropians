<p><p>The links:

<br>
<p><a href="http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=rachel.corey">http://news.google.com/news?hl=en&amp;q=rachel.corey</a><br>
<p>First of all let me put my political cards on the table:
<br>
<p>1. Rachel Corey was most likely my political opposite. I'm sure we'll learn as
<br>
this story develops that she subscribed to some sort of collectivist, statist
<br>
ideology, and that she had a history of anti-American sentiment that some on
<br>
this list would doubtless describe as knee-jerk.
<br>
<p>2. She deliberately put herself in harm's way, and became a contender for
<br>
2003's Darwin Awards result.
<br>
<p><p>That being said, it is still an undisputed fact that an Israeli Army bulldozer
<br>
crushed to death an American citizen engaged in nonviolent, unarmed, political
<br>
protest. When someone like Saddam Hussein does that to &quot;his own&quot; citizens, we
<br>
add that to the long list of reasons justifying his ouster. What do we about a
<br>
foreign government killing one of &quot;our own&quot; citizens?
<br>
<p>Now, before you say the obvious, follow the links. The on-the-scene photos
<br>
and eyewitness accounts you will find by perusing the links above cast heavy
<br>
suspicion on her death being at all accidental.
<br>
<p>Continuing...
<br>
<p>The fact that Corey was a commie pinko leftist politically-correct peacenick
<br>
is completely irrelevant to this case. What's relevant is the fact that, SHE
<br>
WAS AN AMERICAN CITIZEN. I don't care what she believed, what kind of person
<br>
she was, or if her views were in accord with the current administration's
<br>
foreign policy objectives. The only justification of HAVING a foreign policy
<br>
that I even come close to buying is that if some banana republic death-squad
<br>
threatens my life, Uncle Sam is going to make some son-of-a-bitch pay, no
<br>
questions asked about who I vote for or why. If my country can't or won't back
<br>
me up at that level, then it looks like there's some false advertising going
<br>
on, and a few million citizens are entitled to having their 'protection money'
<br>
refunded.
<br>
<p>Don't get me wrong-- the US government just might do the right thing on this
<br>
one. They might demand a public apology from the Israeli government, along
<br>
with proof that concrete measures have been taken to prevent this from ever
<br>
happening again. They might withold foreign aid until these conditions are
<br>
met. They might issue a travel advisory to US citizens travelling to Israel
<br>
that it's not a safe destination for them if they have political disagreements
<br>
with the local government despite that government's claims of being friendly
<br>
and democratic. The US government *might* do the right thing, and my faith in
<br>
it will be somewhat restored if it does, but I'm not holding my breath.
