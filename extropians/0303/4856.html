<p>I don't know much about it either but this seems like it might be
<br>
a promising link and being on a wiki it might even be an instance
<br>
of walking the anarchy talk.
<br>

<br>
<p>Within the wiki page I found the following.

<br>
&nbsp;supposed to be about, have a look at this article. '

<p>PS:  I liked the way you said &quot;I don't believe&quot;, it sounded sort
<br>
of healthy and extropic to me, especially in comparison with
<br>
this quote from Australian Prime Minister John Howard's
<br>
last night reported on page one of Friday's The Australian.
<br>
<p>&quot;John Howard said in a televised address last night that the
<br>
Government had committed &quot;Australian forces to action to
<br>
disarm Iraq because we believe (sic) it is right, it is lawful 
<br>
and it's in Australia's national interest&quot;. Now *that* is a 
<br>
powerful lot of believing.
<br>
<p>BTW. I contacted Tables office of Australian Parliament
<br>
House on Friday and got a report on the advice that the
<br>
government had tabled in support of its &quot;belief:&quot; about the
<br>
legalities. It is a one page sheet from the Australian Attorney
<br>
General's department that refers to a one page bit of advice
<br>
from the UK Att. General. Perhaps size does not matter and
<br>
its nice that governments can share but I am still a bit 
<br>
disconcerted that having now read the advice that the 
<br>
Australian Opposition Leader Simon Crean's office
<br>
faxed me yesterday I can see that it considers the Prime
<br>
Ministers &quot;advice&quot; and comprehensively refutes it. It seems
<br>
the Chinese head of state amongst others is right. Australia
<br>
along with the UK and the USA are acting illegally in 
<br>
invading Iraq.  But as Spike is wont to say &quot;I digress&quot;.
