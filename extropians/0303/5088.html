You've sure got that right!

But do remember that the policeman's first loyalty is to the

Thus the problem.  There is a tremendous assymetry between destruction 
<br>
and construction.  It's so much easier to destroy.  Centralizers always 
<br>
say that we should put our trust in a central authority, but the central 
<br>
authority always betrays those who trust it.  Unless they have the power 
<br>
to stop, or at least punish, the betrayal.  This is one reason why it is 
<br>
so apalling that the mass media are owned by such a small number of 
<br>
corporations.  (If you control the information sufficiently, people 
<br>
won't realize that they have been betrayed.)   I don't find it clear 
<br>
what can be done in the present circumstances to move in the direction 
<br>
of true libertarianism (as opposed to Libertarianism).  The movement 
<br>
appears to be in the opposite direction.  And not slowly.
