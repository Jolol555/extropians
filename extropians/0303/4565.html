<p>My wife's family has taken to referring to death as

<p>Hey it worked for Dr. Frankenstein.  Had it not been for
<br>
tragically incompetent help, the term &quot;muaahahahahaaaaa&quot;

would carry a far different meaning today.  Consider
<br>
also that he was an employer of the disadvantaged many
<br>
years before there were any tax advantages for doing so.

<p>Until we develop the technology to take our money

<br>
<p>After talking to a lot of people about life extension,
<br>
and occasionally about cryonics, I see a disturbing
<br>
pattern.  Few are interested in either, but not
<br>
because they believe methods will not work, but
<br>
rather because they generally aren't having enough *fun*.
<br>
<p>Before the singularity, we may find that lack of fun
<br>
slays more proles than drugs, accidents, disease,
<br>
war, or overeating.  spike
