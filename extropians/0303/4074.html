<p>&lt;&lt;USA: March 10, 2003
<br>
<p>NEW YORK - Hybrid cars, which combine electric motors with small petroleum 
<br>
engines, will outpace the environmental benefits of hydrogen fuel cell cars 
<br>
until at least 2020, according to a university study.   
<br>
<p>Hydrogen fuel-cell vehicles have low emissions and energy use on the road, 
<br>
but converting a hydrocarbon fuel such as natural gas or gasoline into 
<br>
hydrogen to fuel such vehicles uses substantial energy and emits greenhouse 
<br>
gases, the study said.The Massachusetts Institute of Technology study was 
<br>
published after the Bush administration announced in January an initiative to 
<br>
develop hydrogen fuel cells. Combined with last year's government-industry 
<br>
&quot;Freedom Car&quot; program to build vehicles fueled by hydrogen, the initiative 
<br>
will be powered by $1.2 billion in government funds.
<br>
<p>Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham said in January it should be cost-effective 
<br>
to produce hydrogen-fuel cars in large numbers and have them in showrooms by 
<br>
2020.
<br>
<p>The cars could reduce U.S. demand for foreign oil by 11 million barrels per 
<br>
day by 2040, according to the Energy Department.
<br>
<p>But even with aggressive research, a hydrogen fuel-cell vehicle would not be 
<br>
better than a diesel hybrid in terms of total energy use and greenhouse gas 
<br>
emissions by 2020, the study said.
<br>
<p>That's because virtually all industrial hydrogen supply at the moment comes 
<br>
from natural gas. In the future, analysts say, large amounts of hydrogen will 
<br>
be separated from water, where it bonds with oxygen, through the use of 
<br>
alternative energies like wind and solar power.
<br>
<p>But for now, the green method of making hydrogen is too expensive, according 
<br>
to the study. &quot;If we learn how to do it, I think that's absolutely wonderful, 
<br>
but I wouldn't hold my breath,&quot; said Malcolm Weiss, a researcher with MIT's 
<br>
Laboratory for Energy and Environment.
<br>
<p>&quot;Ignoring the emissions and energy use involved in making and delivering the 
<br>
fuel and manufacturing the vehicle gives a misleading impression,&quot; he said.
<br>
<p>Beyond 2020, hydrogen cars will win out, predicted the researchers, who do 
<br>
not recommend stopping work on the hydrogen fuel cell. &quot;If auto systems with 
<br>
significantly lower greenhouse gas emissions are required in, say, 30 to 50 
<br>
years, hydrogen is the only major fuel option identified to date,&quot; said John 
<br>
Heywood, an MIT researcher.
<br>
<p>That hydrogen would have to be produced without making greenhouse gas 
<br>
emissions, through a non-carbon source such as solar energy, or from 
<br>
conventional fuels while sequestering the carbon emissions underground.
<br>
<p>So far, Japan's Honda Motor Co. Ltd. and Toyota Motor Corp. are the leading 
<br>
makers of hybrid automobiles. Hybrids have fossil fuel engines that work 
<br>
alternatively or in concert with electric motors to reduce smog emissions and 
<br>
increase fuel economy, without ever having to be plugged in&gt;&gt;
