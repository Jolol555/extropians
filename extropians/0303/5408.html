Steve Davies opined:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Theresponse is then a matter of individual judgement and private action. In 
<br>
the
<br>
case of the ME I believe Americans (and Brits etc) should intervene, by
<br>
assisting groups and individuals, by spreading ideas through organised
<br>
propaganda and indirectly through trade. The key thing in the ME and the
<br>
Islamic world more generally is to fund and help rationalist Muslims who are
<br>
trying to reconstitute the rationalist tradition in Islam (specifically the
<br>
Mutazilite tradition). The terrible disaster that has to be fought in this
<br>
way is the continuing destruction of moderate Islam by Saudi funded salafist
<br>
clerics over the last 20 years. I know you would have to repeal the Logan
<br>
Act but I think you should do that anyway.
<br>
<p>Steve Davies&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Well said. However, I am never 100% sure that the Muslim realm is adjustable, 
<br>
by anything less then an apparent &quot;Fatwa by Allah&quot;; ME weather change, Mecca 
<br>
and Medina being destroyed, deaths of Islamist leadership, and the rest. Then 
<br>
the Uma might think that Allah is not favorable to the Wahabbist-Ayatolah 
<br>
bunch. Then the focus might seek moderate thinking.
