&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brown's Gas and Energy  by   Tom Napier
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So-called Brown's Gas is a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen gas
<br>
prepared by electrolyzing water.  Generators which prepare Brown's Gas
<br>
are sold for welding.  Brown's Gas has also been proposed as a fuel for
<br>
internal combustion engines and as an input gas for fuel cells.  Here I
<br>
propose to examine the energetics of Brown's Gas and the practicality of
<br>
these latter applications.
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
There is nothing 'wonderful' or 'not fully understood' about the
<br>
combustion characteristics of the stoichiometric mixture 2H2O2.  The
<br>
flame burns with a comparitively low 'specific heat' per unit volume
<br>
making it impractical / uneconomical for most commercial ferrous metal
<br>
working businesses. There is no way, that a hydroxy flame can compete in
<br>
speed or labor with LPG or acetylene for oxyfuel gas cutting and most
<br>
brazing applications.
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
The bottom line is that we have put in about a kilowatt of electrical
<br>
energy to get out under a third as much in mechanical energy.
<br>
Considering that the efficiency of an electric motor would be over 85%
<br>
there is no justification at all for using a Brown's Gas generator and
<br>
an internal combustion engine.  An electric motor would do better at
<br>
less cost and with far greater reliability.
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
It has also been proposed to use Brown's Gas in a fuel cell.  Unless it
<br>
is proposed to store the Brown's Gas, this is an inherently absurd idea.
<br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
Thus the ratio of output electrical power to input electrical power
<br>
would be roughly 42%.  Operating such a system has no conceivable
<br>
utility.
