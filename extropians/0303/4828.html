Thinking Outside the Tank 
<br>
<p>By Sharon Waxman MARINA DEL REY, Calif. 
<br>
<p><p>A few years back, some military officials got together and wondered whether
<br>
Hollywood could play a part in the U.S. defense effort. 
<br>
<p>They weren't looking for propaganda films that would win the hearts and minds of
<br>
the Arab world, or for talent to entertain the troops, or for free DVDs to send
<br>
to remote aircraft carriers. They were looking, strangely enough, for fresh
<br>
ideas in designing the Army of the future. Stranger still, it turned out that
<br>
Hollywood had plenty of ideas, some of them good ones. 
<br>
<p>So it happens that inside a drab, '70s-style office building here, one of
<br>
Hollywood's hottest screenwriters, a production designer from &quot;Alien&quot; and &quot;Back
<br>
to the Future,&quot; the co-writer of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and the director of &quot;Grease&quot;
<br>
have gotten together with some of the U.S. Army's leading academics and computer
<br>
scientists to brainstorm about the next generation of weaponry and equipment. 
<br>
<p>The meetings, with these and other Hollywood figures, have been going on once or
<br>
twice a month for more than two years, taking on extra urgency after the events
<br>
of Sept. 11, 2001. Even as opposition mounts in Hollywood to Washington's plans
<br>
for war with Iraq, a small group of entertainment-industry recruits continues to
<br>
grapple with combat-related questions, including: 
<br>
<p>How do you remove wounded soldiers from the battlefield under fire? What kinds
<br>
of communication tools will officers need to make better decisions on the
<br>
ground? How do you conduct military operations in crowded urban centers? 
<br>
<p>&quot;Entertainment people think in a totally different way from conventional
<br>
business and scientific thinking,&quot; explains Richard Lindheim, executive director
<br>
for the Institute for Creative Technologies (ICT), the Marina Del Rey think tank
<br>
where the Army and Tinseltown collaborate. 
<br>
<p>&quot;In science you have a problem, and a hypothesis for a solution, then . . . you
<br>
build it,&quot; says Lindheim, a former executive at Paramount Pictures. &quot;The
<br>
entertainment approach is the opposite. It's: What's our vision? What do we want
<br>
it to do? They'll break it down and work backwards to figure out how to get it
<br>
done.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The ICT's few dozen Hollywood recruits are a somewhat random representation of
<br>
the entertainment industry, a tiny fraction of the thousands who labor there.
<br>
They offer some ideas in the form of short films that illustrate proposed new
<br>
equipment, or video games for training. Other proposals come as drawings and
<br>
mock-ups of futuristic tanks, uniforms and helicopters. 
<br>
<p>Among the ideas they have proposed -- and even designed -- as possible solutions
<br>
to problems posed by military planners: 
<br>
<p>• Modular tanks that come apart for transport by plane and can be reassembled on
<br>
arrival. 
<br>
<p>• Roman-style shields mounted on skateboards and stored on the sides of tanks,
<br>
to be used to conceal a soldier crossing an urban street while under fire. 
<br>
<p>• Lightweight  uniforms with inner reinforcement to create exoskeletal armor. 
<br>
<p>• Insectlike  electronic sensors that can move around and relay information. 
<br>
<p>• Robotic &quot;mules,&quot; or unmanned ground vehicles, that carry soldiers' equipment
<br>
and sense enemy movement. 
<br>
<p>While the buglike sensors sound like something straight out of  Steven
<br>
Spielberg's &quot;Minority Report&quot; (in which mechanical spiders set out to detect a
<br>
cowering Tom Cruise), not all of these ideas remain in the realm of the
<br>
imagination. 
<br>
<p>Production designer Ron Cobb's sketch for the robotic mule was at first greeted
<br>
with skepticism by Army brass. So he was surprised (and not a little flattered)
<br>
to learn a few months ago that the Army had asked Boeing to figure out how to
<br>
build a vehicle that looked exactly like his design. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It's exciting to see something being developed in the real world,&quot; Cobb says
<br>
from his home in Australia. &quot;The idea was simply that the soldier increasingly
<br>
needs to be agile and mobile, and the state of robotics is such that it might be
<br>
possible to take a load off the soldier and have his equipment follow him like a
<br>
dog, or a mule.&quot; 
<br>
<p>To be sure, the ICT program is a small cog in the vast  military apparatus of
<br>
research and technology. It's a $9 million-a-year undertaking within an overall
<br>
effort funded at $1.6 billion this year. Two other Army-funded  labs undertake
<br>
similar futurist research, at MIT and the University of Texas. But even within
<br>
the Army hierarchy, the Hollywood project stands out for the unusual nature of
<br>
its participants, and their unusual mandate. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We don't do 'story.' We don't know how to do story. And how do people learn?
<br>
From storytellers,&quot; says Mike Andrews, the  scientist who oversees the Army's
<br>
entire research program. &quot;These people have creative talents that we have to tap
<br>
into to move into the future.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Within the Army, Andrews said, the ICT &quot;is taken very seriously in terms of its
<br>
opportunity to help us.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Of that there seems little doubt. In the aftermath of 9/11, the Army drew on its
<br>
pool of Hollywood experts to come up with possible terrorism scenarios to help
<br>
with training and preparedness. 
<br>
<p>And the ICT has an enthusiastic booster in Chief of Staff Gen. Eric K. Shinseki,
<br>
who keeps close at hand a five-minute ICT training video depicting futuristic
<br>
soldiers with stealth uniforms and robotic vehicles, eager to show it at the
<br>
least spark of interest. 'Molecular Change' If the idea of using Hollywood
<br>
dream-weavers to solve real-life military problems sounds a bit batty, the Army
<br>
says you're way behind the times. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The Army is a lot more open-minded than Hollywood tends to portray us,&quot; says
<br>
Michael Macedonia, chief scientist for the Army's simulation program. &quot;The
<br>
reality is we're very serious about being the best army in the world. We'll do
<br>
anything. If that means trying to learn from Hollywood and the gaming industry,
<br>
then I think that's the way to go.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Still, collaboration is not exactly what one might have expected between two
<br>
mutually skeptical organizations. The last time the entertainment industry
<br>
really worked in partnership with the military was during World War II, when
<br>
directors and actors were drafted to make propaganda movies. 
<br>
<p>But then came Vietnam, and the age of &quot;Catch-22&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H.&quot; Since the late
<br>
1960s, largely-liberal Hollywood has frequently treated the military with scorn.
<br>
For its part, the military has carefully scrutinized even patriotic epics like
<br>
&quot;Pearl Harbor&quot; for a critical undertone. 
<br>
<p>The terrorist attacks on New York and Washington seem to have changed entrenched
<br>
attitudes, motivating more than one former skeptic to reconsider. &quot;After 9/11,
<br>
some molecular change happened to me,&quot; says writer David Ayer, whose screenplay
<br>
about a corrupt cop, &quot;Training Day,&quot; propelled Denzel Washington to an Oscar
<br>
last year. &quot;I never want to see that happen again. I felt so helpless. I had to
<br>
do something.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Ayer, a Navy veteran, has been working steadily with ICT for more than a year on
<br>
a command and communication system, earning a five-figure government-level
<br>
salary for his work while he continues his screenwriting career. 
<br>
<p>The attacks, and the subsequent collaboration, seem to be provoking change on
<br>
the military side, too. &quot;They're making a big impact -- they've made a big
<br>
impact,&quot; says Macedonia, who happily reads an e-mail from an Army major now in
<br>
Bagram, Afghanistan, thanking him for an ICT-developed training video about
<br>
working in foreign cultures. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It's heretical for an organization like the Army to have its colonels running
<br>
around discussing their problems,&quot; Ayer says. &quot;But it's cool: They want to save
<br>
lives. They want stuff to work better and cheaper.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The White House made a vague attempt to foster cooperation with Hollywood in the
<br>
wake of the 9/11 attacks, heralded in a glossy photo op between senior Bush aide
<br>
Karl Rove and Hollywood power brokers Sherry Lansing, Robert Iger and Jack
<br>
Valenti. Despite the hoopla, that effort amounted to little. Instead, it is the
<br>
ICT that has quietly won enthusiastic adherents in the Hollywood community. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm not a Bush supporter,&quot; Cobb says. &quot;But the plight of the Army, and its use
<br>
in humanitarian roles, in Kosovo or Afghanistan, the rising desire to use
<br>
nonlethal weaponry . . . that is worth supporting.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Cobb is well known in Hollywood for designing the canteen scene in the first
<br>
&quot;Star Wars&quot; movie and the time-traveling DeLorean in &quot;Back to the Future.&quot; He's
<br>
also a Vietnam veteran and a former underground cartoonist. 
<br>
<p>He finds working for the Army a good fit. &quot;I'm kind of a frustrated engineer.
<br>
And I'm very interested in the ideas in problem-solving engineering,&quot; he says.
<br>
As for the Army, he observes: &quot;They thought we were all going to be lunatics
<br>
because we're from the film business -- and some of us were. But they ended up
<br>
being impressed with us.&quot; Going Outside the Culture The idea of tapping
<br>
Hollywood for military input has been around for several years. A 1997 study by
<br>
the National Academy of Sciences identified a nexus between Army simulation
<br>
technology and video gaming, and recommended calling on Hollywood to help the
<br>
government's efforts. 
<br>
<p>After a visit to the Walt Disney Co.'s Imagineering facility, a future-oriented
<br>
ideas lab, four-star Army Gen. Paul Kern explored the idea of collaboration. But
<br>
talks broke down over intellectual property rights -- who would own the joint
<br>
research -- and Disney's reluctance to work too closely with government
<br>
bureaucracy. 
<br>
<p>Instead Kern turned to Andrews, the Army's deputy assistant secretary for
<br>
research and technology, who looked into the possibility of using a broader,
<br>
less official Hollywood pool. Andrews and Macedonia began surveying universities
<br>
that might host such a program, and quickly settled on the University of
<br>
Southern California, which in 2000 won a five-year, $45 million grant from the
<br>
Army to create the ICT. Entertainment companies have also sunk several million
<br>
dollars into the institute; Sony, for one, hopes to glean innovations for its
<br>
video games from the research. 
<br>
<p>Former screenwriter James Korris had recently taken over the Entertainment
<br>
Technology Center at USC, researching digital cinema. He soon found himself
<br>
setting up an Army think tank for &quot;immersive realities&quot; -- more realistic
<br>
training videos. 
<br>
<p>That's how it began. Lindheim was recruited from Paramount, and the two began to
<br>
contact colleagues who they thought would be interesting and interested. Some
<br>
people seemed obvious choices. In interviewing Ron Cobb, they suggested that he
<br>
look at the &quot;whispercraft&quot; in the Arnold Schwarzenegger movie &quot;The Sixth Day,&quot; a
<br>
helicopter that converts to an airplane and back again. Cobb was already
<br>
familiar with the plane -- since he'd designed it. 
<br>
<p>Other candidates seemed more of a stretch, like Randal Kleiser, the director of
<br>
&quot;Grease&quot; and &quot;The Blue Lagoon.&quot; He joined after learning of the project through
<br>
his friend John Milius, co-screenwriter of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and an enthusiastic
<br>
ICT member. 
<br>
<p>The Hollywoodites were vetted for top-level security clearance, and flown around
<br>
the country to hear briefings by senior Army personnel about the challenges
<br>
facing them on the battlefield. They met the scientists who were already working
<br>
on solutions. 
<br>
<p>The first ICT &quot;cell&quot; comprised about a dozen people, including professionals
<br>
from the movies, television, gaming, computer science and academia. Early
<br>
conversations focused on the Army's goal of a &quot;future combat system,&quot; for arming
<br>
soldiers with state-of-the-art technology. 
<br>
<p>Korris was surprised. &quot;It was an interesting, balanced conversation. It wasn't
<br>
just wacky.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Says Lindheim: &quot;We thought something would happen in five years. But within a
<br>
year, things began to cook.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Then came another project, focused on the problems soldiers face fighting in
<br>
cities. For this exercise, the ICT rented a ballroom in a Marina del Rey hotel
<br>
to refight the battle of Hue in Vietnam, using a model of that city. The Army
<br>
commander who actually fought and won the engagement (in 1968) attended. 
<br>
<p>Says Korris: &quot;We found that the off-the-shelf technology available to future
<br>
guerrillas would probably be so good that they would be formidable opponents.&quot; 
<br>
<p>A project that followed soon after involved dreaming up stories regarding future
<br>
conflicts. They came back with plots such as: Four children wander into a
<br>
minefield in an area where American soldiers are on a peacekeeping mission. How
<br>
should they respond? Another contributor suggested a scenario in which Muslim
<br>
fundamentalists in Jerusalem mine the sacred sites in the ancient city. Another
<br>
suggested: China invades Taiwan. How does the U.S. Army react? 
<br>
<p>Many such conflict scenarios are debated in war game seminars within the Army
<br>
bureaucracy already. But, says Korris, &quot;The question was -- is there any value
<br>
in getting ideas from a group of people who have no conditioning in the system?&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;We probably came up with different solutions than the Army came up with,&quot; says
<br>
Milius. &quot;From Roman shields with skateboards that come off the sides of tanks,
<br>
to tunnels made of foam that you spray that dissolve in 12 hours. I'm not going
<br>
to say these things exist, but if you see any foam in Baghdad absorbing tank
<br>
rounds, you'll know we developed it.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Tunnels made of foam -- what next? An enormous French baguette that doubles as
<br>
an amphibious landing unit? 
<br>
<p>Rapidly, the ICT project mushroomed in size and scope. The penchant for making
<br>
small training and demonstration films has developed into an in-house production
<br>
facility called ICT Productions. Korris is looking to spin off some of his ideas
<br>
into television pilots. The institute now has about 55 employees. 
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, the computer experts are developing training videos that use
<br>
&quot;synthespians,&quot; virtual actors that are almost indistinguishable from human
<br>
ones. And ICT's project to conceive a future combat system is well underway.
<br>
'Starship Troopers' The film unspooling across the huge screen in the ICT office
<br>
building is called &quot;Incident at Brcko Bridge.&quot; It was shot somewhere in the
<br>
hills outside Pasadena. In the film -- actually an &quot;animatic&quot; sequence of 3,000
<br>
still photographs -- a handful of Army soldiers defend the bridge in the face of
<br>
an angry mob. 
<br>
<p>The incident really did occur, in Bosnia. Seven young soldiers were instructed
<br>
to hold the bridge against an angry throng who'd been sent by Serb authorities
<br>
to create an international incident. The soldiers had been instructed to inflict
<br>
no casualties; they endured eight hours of being poked with glass shards by the
<br>
mob, but held the bridge. 
<br>
<p>The film suggests what future technology might do to make them better equipped
<br>
for their jobs. In the film, the soldiers -- outfitted in rented uniforms once
<br>
used in &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; -- wear helmets with goggles that electronically
<br>
display their geographic coordinates. Their uniforms have built-in equipment to
<br>
monitor the soldiers' vital signs in case they are wounded. 
<br>
<p>The soldiers have with them Cobb's robotic mule; a small disk detaches from the
<br>
top of the mule, flies ahead to reconnoiter, and relays information back to the
<br>
troops. When the mob approaches, a soldier warns them to halt, and his words are
<br>
amplified and translated into Serbian. 
<br>
<p>Will anything besides the mule be designed and built in the real world? The Army
<br>
won't confirm, and the consultants at ICT don't know. 
<br>
<p>&quot;We just put it in the hopper,&quot; says Milius. 
<br>
<p>But clearly some things are trickling through. &quot;I've seen our stuff show up on
<br>
posters, plans, on briefing slides,&quot; says Korris. &quot;It's very gratifying for me.
<br>
If you'd have told me three years ago I'd be doing this, I'd say you were on
<br>
drugs. But it's been endlessly fascinating.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Says Andrews: &quot;We don't know the full potential of what we'll get from ICT.
<br>
There's an opportunity here that's just starting to be recognized.&quot;
