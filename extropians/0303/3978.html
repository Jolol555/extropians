<em>&gt; (Dickey, Michael F &lt;<a href="mailto:michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com?Subject=Re:%20Do%20patents%20really%20foster%20innovation?">michael_f_dickey@groton.pfizer.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would certainly be interested to hear what extropians think of Patents (at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, mechanical innovation patents)  There is a large portion of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; libertarians here, and I generally consider myself one (a 'neo'-libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess to be more accurate) but I do not see much value in the arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against IP.  They seem to center around 'see, there has been plenty of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovation without patents, the wheel, steam engines, etc'  to which I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond 'yeah, but those took thousands of years to come about'  
</em><br>
<p>First of all, let's change the rules: the burden of proof is on those
<br>
who wish to support patents, not those who wish to remove them, because
<br>
freedom should always be the default.  Patents reduce freedom.
<br>
<p>Second, even as someone who opposes the idea, I don't deny for a moment
<br>
that they encourage innovation.  Indeed, that's one reason I oppose them:
<br>
they encourage innovation /for its own sake/ over other things like
<br>
craftsmanship, gradual refinement and evolution, collaborative
<br>
development, competition, and other things I think are more important
<br>
than mere innovation.  If people invent novel things, that's fine, but
<br>
I also want people to make not-so-novel things, interesting combinations,
<br>
refinements, and customizations of existing things.  I want more people
<br>
competing to find cheaper ways to produce things.  I want people to find
<br>
and exploit more markets for things than the inventor ever imagined.
<br>
<p>The idea that inventors inherently deserve reward is the communist
<br>
fallacy of the labor theory of value: the totally discredited idea that
<br>
the value of a thing is inherent in its creation.  That's simply not
<br>
true, and policies based on that idea are doomed to failure, as all
<br>
socialist systems have been.  Value is created by /demand/, and so what
<br>
should be rewarded is the ability to fulfill demand, whether by
<br>
innovation or other means.  Without patents, innovation will still be
<br>
rewarded /when it fulfills a demand/, but not otherwise, which is how
<br>
it should be.
