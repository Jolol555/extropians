</em><br>
<p>Depends on what you consider 'great accuracy'. Remember that the Norden
<br>
bombsight was considered so state of the art that its existence was a
<br>
secret, yet it still required the dropping of hundreds of bombs to hit
<br>
one target. The V-2, armed only with a TNT warhead, needed accuracy of
<br>
a hundred meters or so to have any hope of effectiveness, while nuclear
<br>
armed ICBMs had little need even of that degree of accuracy, since they
<br>
had blast radii measured in miles. 
<br>
<p>Weapon accuracy only became a desirable trait in the Vietnam era, when
<br>
the first laser guided bombs were deployed and with the propaganda war,
<br>
collateral damage started to become an issue. There was also an
<br>
accuracy contest in the area of air-to-air missiles, since so few
<br>
Vietnam era US fighters were armed with internal cannon, and the
<br>
air-to-air missiles tended to be so unreliable. 
<br>
<p>The MacNamara 'whiz kids' did the first studies of cost effectiveness
<br>
of weapons systems and turned around the existing paradigm, from one of
<br>
mass collateralism with heavy weapons and high accuracy with infantry
<br>
weapons to high accuracy with heavy weapons and mass force
<br>
multiplication with infantry weapons.
<br>
<p>The German U-boat launched missile could not be launched from a
<br>
submerged position, either. They required that the sub be surfaced,
<br>
while the US and Soviet systems launched while submerged.
<br>
<p>However, the V-1 was used as a cruise missile platform by the US and
<br>
the Soviets in the post-war era for a number of years until domestic
<br>
designs were fielded that were usually supersonic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The British developed applications of electromagnetism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and information theory (radar, the first computers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; degaussing techniques, etc) while the Germans were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; building on materials science and industrial production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (better tanks, submarines, guns, rocketry, jet engines,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Russian tanks were better than German tanks by 1944.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think part of this was that the Germans got comfortable being in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the lead and didn't think the war would last that long. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Hitler specifically ordered that new weapons systems be
<br>
cancelled in late 1940, thus delaying the introduction of many of the
<br>
wonderweapons we now associate with the Nazi war machine until a point
<br>
at which they could have absolutely no significant impact on the
<br>
outcome of the war. He thought that the war would be over by 1942 with
<br>
Germany victorious, and he wanted to focus resources on finishing the
<br>
war and getting prepared for construction of his Germania european
<br>
socialist state capital.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Allies, on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other hand, seemed to go whole hog.  I guess a generalization can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made here: nothing fails like early success.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, for many advances, the Germans did rely on espionage, sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in very tricky ways.  
</em><br>
<p>True. All of the systems that Von Braun integrated into the V-2 system
<br>
were originally invented by Goddard here in the US, and Von Braun
<br>
admitted that German embassy staff was employed in obtaining US patent
<br>
reprints of such technologies.
