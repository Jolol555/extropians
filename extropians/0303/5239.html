I just heard on MSNBC, that the US Navy will use concrete filled bombs 
<br>
instead of plastique-loaded weapons; to reduce casualties in Bagdad. Ah 
<br>
kinetic-kill newtonian physics, is there no end to its usefulness? 
<br>
(homeresque statement)
<br>
<p>MMB (aka Lorrey Clone) opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;As with most miltech, the easiest terror use is based on stealing it or 
<br>
divertng it, not reinventing it. That said, the primary ingredents of the 
<br>
US FAMs are pretty much public. No, I'm not naming them here. They are 
<br>
nasty (toxic) chemicals to begin with. Not sure about the thermobaric 
<br>
stuff. The remaining mysteries are dispersal and ignition, and that seems 
<br>
to me to be a matter of a few months, maybe a year, tops, of messing around 
<br>
in the vicinity of desert caves with a milling machine and a set of 
<br>
chemical-supply and surplus-store catalogs handy--and a DHL drop. Having a 
<br>
few unexpended/dud rounds could shorten that time quite a bit, as long as 
<br>
you were lucky or clever.&gt;&gt;
