*APPLAUSE TO ARTILLO*
<br>
<p>It's about time someone told Ron H. to his face like
<br>
it is. Thank you very much, Artillo! I've not been on
<br>
this group all that long, but I surmise there are far
<br>
more lurkers than posters, with Ron H. definitely
<br>
being one of the more frequent posters. After reading
<br>
his posts for some time now, I'm convinced his
<br>
knowledge of world history is pretty limited and he
<br>
likes it to be that way. Everything has to be
<br>
American-centric and if anyone disagrees, he's quick
<br>
to label them &quot;anti-American&quot;. He seems to be able to
<br>
think in terms of only black and white without seeing
<br>
the many shades of gray on various
<br>
socio/political/economic/etc issues that are extremely
<br>
complex. For a man of his experience, education, and
<br>
age, it's sad that people can be so dumb in this day
<br>
and age. 
<br>
<p>Thanks again, Artillo.

&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Arti,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of that matters.  What counts is that the
<br>
US is the one that has 
<br>
&nbsp;been shot at, hit, lost citizenry/visitors, and is
<br>
being aimed at again.  
<br>
&nbsp;That you wish to knock off the US, aren't concerned

with American loss of 
<br>
&nbsp;life and don't like us anyway means nothing.  
<br>
&nbsp;Have a good day,

<em>  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ron,
<br>
<p>Up until now I have refrained from responding on any
<br>
of your commentary thus 
<br>
far, but I think this one takes the cake and is
<br>
deserving of a reply.Your 
<br>
obvious lack of reading comprehension skills and
<br>
penchant for putting words 
<br>
in people's mouths makes you sound like more of a
<br>
buffoon than ever before. 
<br>
<p>Point #1: I think that the opinion of the world's
<br>
human beings matters very 
<br>
much. Unfortunately, there will never be a completely
<br>
honest representation 
<br>
of people's opinions in any poll for obvious reasons.
<br>
<p>Point #2: Nowhere in my post did I EVER state that I
<br>
&quot;wish[ed] to knock off 
<br>
the US&quot; as you seem to think I did. I think I stated
<br>
my intentions rather 
<br>
plainly in the original post. Read more carefully next
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Point #3: I am not only concerned with the loss of
<br>
American lives, but the 
<br>
lives of EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET. If
<br>
war can be averted at any 
<br>
cost then THAT is the road we need to take for
<br>
HUMANITY'S sake. We need to 
<br>
stop slaughtering eachother over bullshit ideological,
<br>
religious, or 
<br>
otherwise dogmatic reasons.
<br>
<p>Point #4: I think you have the misconception that I am
<br>
not an American 
<br>
Citizen. The only kinds of people I dislike are
<br>
ignorant, close-minded, and 
<br>
blindly patriotic, but... this is America and everyone
<br>
is entitled to their 
<br>
opinion as long as it's not forced down our throats.
<br>
Would I be better off as 
<br>
a citizen of another country? I surely don't know.
<br>
<p>Ron, why exactly are you still on this list? It seems
<br>
to me that much of the 
<br>
rhetoric I have seen you spouting off recently seems
<br>
to have very little with 
<br>
core Extropian values and a lot to do with you being
<br>
pissed off at the way 
<br>
the world is today. YES I agree with you, the world is
<br>
a pretty messed up 
<br>
place, YES there are lots and lots of bad people out
<br>
there, and YES there are 
<br>
many forms of injustice out there, however, I do NOT
<br>
agree with ANY 
<br>
government who decides to KILL to support their own
<br>
brand of dogma, INCLUDING 
<br>
the United States. I also am very disconcerted about
<br>
the direction the 
<br>
current US administration and it's agents are taking
<br>
this country are taking 
<br>
in regards to our civil liberties. I don't think I
<br>
have to lecture you on the 
<br>
importance of rational arguments on these issues and
<br>
the rights of the people 
<br>
to petition the government for a redress of grievances
<br>
if they have a problem 
<br>
with the way things are going. I hope that those of us
<br>
who truly care about 
<br>
these and other rights make their voices heard loud
<br>
and clear before those 
<br>
same rights are taken away from us by policies that
<br>
are bordering on Fascism.
<br>
<p>If you don't like it when someone like me wants to try
<br>
to get a balanced view 
<br>
of the issues by attmpting to obtain information from
<br>
sources outside of 
<br>
their general sphere of resources, then I suggest you
<br>
stop reading any more 
<br>
emails and simply rely on CBS news or wherever you go
<br>
to shop for your daily 
<br>
dose of yellow journalism. Of course, you are more
<br>
than welcome to 
<br>
participate in a Flame War with me, but it will be a
<br>
rather futile exercise 
<br>
(you can't have a war with only one side fighting!),
<br>
so I would encourage you 
<br>
to maintain your dignity and stop before you start.
<br>
<p>With all due respect,
<br>
<p>Artillo
