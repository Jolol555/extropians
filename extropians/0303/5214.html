</em><br>
<p>Well, yes. After all, in theory ugly/crippled people could be forced into
<br>
institutions where you would never see them. I heard that in some
<br>
cultures, kids with hare lips are kept indoors almost their whole lives...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that you should reconsider your very broad
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now while that might be okay for physics  ;-)  it
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would mean, for example, that since you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing me to read your email subject lines, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your name to the left of them, then perhaps whatever
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; same basic category.  And *you* were the one who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started using force after all!
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you could use force to stop from looking at my emails. You could
<br>
block my emails, or kick me off the list, or whatever. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, I understood.  And you're right; but I'd say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead that it depends on one's value system.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I think that we are saying the same thing.
</em><br>
<p>I think so... A particular aesthetic philosophy has a set of criteria for
<br>
establish what is valuable or not... So it's a kind of &quot;value system&quot;...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes.  As it stands, local communities still have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legal right to pass ordinances against a great many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things---anything (in the U.S., that is) at least that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not violate the Constitution, the supreme law of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the land.  If I had my way, they could pass laws against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *whatever* they pleased that did not strictly violate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the constitution, including, for example, abortion, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other laws favoring infanticide.  But few agree with me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there:  the honest ones will disagree by claiming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a kind of utilitarianism supports their position that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the federal government should disallow such local freedom,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dishonest ones will twist the constitution until it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says whatever they want.
</em><br>
<p>Legal &quot;rights&quot; to do anything are basically memes. Through human behavior,
<br>
they can exert various kinds of force. The U.S. Constitution, and any
<br>
particular interpretation of it, are memes. The humans who contain these
<br>
memes can exercise bodily force to follow or advance them. That anyone can
<br>
do whatever they please, and that they will tend to do what they are
<br>
&quot;forced&quot; (in this very general analytical sense) to do, is a fact of
<br>
reality, not a political viewpoint or desideratum. We all have our way, we
<br>
just don't necessary exert much sway. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But more seriously, note your egregious use of the word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;force&quot; yet again;  no one really forces anyone else to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with them in a free country.
</em><br>
<p>Lee, I just don't see the analytical value of talking about
<br>
this sort of &quot;freedom&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I don't wish to reductively deny the human-level experience of
<br>
&quot;freedom&quot; (which is real), or to reduce things to their literal
<br>
physics-level interactions (agentless, supposedly). But I am using the
<br>
word force in a kind of literal, kind of rhetorical way to describe the
<br>
play of forces in the world that cause things to be the way they are, the
<br>
play of cause and effect. 
<br>
<p>I cannot see that I have ever personally exerted any significant force on
<br>
the issue of billboards, to take the example from my previous post. Why
<br>
then doesn't it make sense to analyze my having to see billboards as the
<br>
result of someone else's use of force? That is actually the case.  Whether
<br>
it was a majority, or a cash-full company, or a politician on a mission,
<br>
or just the advertisers themselves, someone exerted the force to bring
<br>
about the condition I am faced with. And it was not me.
<br>
<p>p.s. though - if &quot;freedom&quot; is thought of as a property of agents and
<br>
subjects (as opposed to patients and objects), we might, as Haraway
<br>
suggested, attribute agenthood and subjecthood to units of reality that
<br>
exhibited any sort of undetermined, indeterminable behavior - such as
<br>
elementary atomic particles, or clouds in the sky. Saying that they
<br>
&quot;choose&quot; to go here or there is not far from the metaphorical
<br>
mark. Anything whose behavior is significantly influenced by probablistic,
<br>
random, or even chaotic factors.
