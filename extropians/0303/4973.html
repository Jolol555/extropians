<p>
How much do precision munitions cost? Maybe the Arab world had best 
<br>
recycle their tanks and buy a bunch of pickup trucks. I mean, taking out 
<br>
a tank with a laser-guided bomb sounds plenty cost-effective, but how 
<br>
'bout pickup trucks?
<br>
<p>I doubt Iraqis have been subjected to decades of systematic 
<br>
psychological castration such as the television sitcom 'Eight Rules for 
<br>
Dating my Teen Daughter' and just about any nonpolitical talkshow. 
<br>
Thomas Friedmen suggests not underestimating the power of humiliation. 
<br>
He's talking about the rest of the world of course. These days the line 
<br>
to humiliate yourself on U.S. nationwide TV goes all the way round the 
<br>
block.
<br>
<p>So what's an Iraqi to do? He doesn't like Saddam, but also doesn't wanna 
<br>
return to his hood having surrendered w/o a fight. He knows in any 
<br>
*real* fight, his goose will be flashfried in short order. So why not 
<br>
take the family pickup, get a few friends and AK-47's and RPG's 
<br>
together, and go take a shot at the Americans? Empty your magazines and 
<br>
speed away. You don't even have to do it more than once. Stash the guns 
<br>
and greet the Americans with open arms. You did your bit. You're a hero 
<br>
to your homeboys. You might even get on CNN.
<br>
<p>How do you fight that? Kill them all?
<br>
