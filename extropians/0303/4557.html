<p><em>&gt;Logic error: they'll hopelessly trivialize the issue

<p>It's not an issue of logic but of pragmatics. In fact, it's quite likely
<br>
that my reputation as a serious commentator on such topics would be damaged
<br>
by a clumsy response to the brilliant and cruel jester running the show. As
<br>
it turned out, last night's premier ep indicated that he's reining in his
<br>
sarcasm, so the risk might yet turn out to be worth it. 
<br>
<p>But I should have elaborated on the format of what I declined to
<br>
participate in: it was pitched as a brief (5-8 minute?) competitive panel
<br>
of `experts' on varieties of global doom: nano goo, superbugs, space
<br>
debris, mad AI. I instantly summarized the pitch as `You call *that* a
<br>
knife?' and the producer enthusiastically agreed. I pointed out that for
<br>
me, the most unexpected kind of `disaster' likely to follow from a super AI
<br>
was weirdly two-sided: that in fact, the outcome might be heaven on earth,
<br>
but that people would find the prospect of such a happy result terrifying
<br>
and ugly since it would mean not being human any longer. 
<br>
<p>This was all too difficult to convey in a couple of minutes, of course.
<br>
Clearly I was meant to say that mad Terminators would wreck the world in
<br>
their blinding artificial stupidity. That is actually quite plausible, but
<br>
there's no leverage in saying so to several 100,000 humans, and even less
<br>
in trying to persuade them that transcension under a benevolent Super AI
<br>
will be the bee's knees and devoutly to be wished.
