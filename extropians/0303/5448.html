<p>Wow.  Ad hominem on the scale of whole nations.  German and Japanese
<br>
opposition I suppose you'll dismiss because of WWII.  The British, what, too
<br>
socialist?  Ditto for the Canadians, despite all the peacekeeping troops they
<br>
send out.  Eastern European opposition, despite their usually being our best
<br>
friends these days on account of deep appreciation for our role in the Cold
<br>
War, doesn't matter because...
<br>
<p>At what point, in the face of collected world opinion, do you start
<br>
questioning your own conclusions, or your own view of the facts?  If someone's
<br>
suffering mass delusion, why not you?
<br>
<p>Do you really think hundreds of thousands of people are protesting, and the
<br>
poll results are so opposed, because of oil?  French and Russian governmental
<br>
concern for oil contracts I could believe.  But we're talking about the
<br>
popular opinion of a majority of the First World.  When they say that bad as
<br>
Iraq is it's not worth a war, when they question the claims of WMDs and of
<br>
support for terrorists, asking for more evidence than forged and plagiarised
<br>
documents, how are you so sure you can dismiss them?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This can't be right.. The USA, through democratic and republican 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administrations funded NATO at 85% total cost per year, during the cold war. 
</em><br>
<p>Oh, economic costs.  I'd interpreted the claim about burdens we bore alone as
<br>
referring to lack of moral support.  Yes, we've spent 3x as much of our GDP on
<br>
the military, and tended to have a bigger GDP, especially shortly after WWII.
