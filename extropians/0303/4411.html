<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;What I have learned:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;(i) Any measure such as the Patriot Act can cut both
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    ways, and one must always imagine how one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    feel if the opposite party were in power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;(ii) It's not probable that the likes of Sean Penn (who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    is not half as bad as Jane Fonda was), or any others
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    will be persecuted by the U.S. government for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;    political beliefs.  I could be wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The argument was [is?] that people will only be persecuted
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for their beliefs when it is advantageous for the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any huge system, like a government, will always do what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantageous for it to do.  Right now, for example, in almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any Western country to arrest people for speaking their views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is practically unthinkable (not only because of the political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences, but, like other entitles, governments are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creatures of habit too).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Until now if our particular government wanted to do such things 
<br>
it at least did not have the law its side.  Today the gloves are 
<br>
off.  Bill of Rights? Constitution?  Forget them.  And no, 
<br>
neither was designed to be set aside during even a real war, 
<br>
much less the self-declared intention to do harm whenever the 
<br>
current administration pleases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The guiding principle of both parties seems to be to ensure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;that everyone can be proven to be a dangerous criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;whenever they so choose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it's fair to say that this is their tendency,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but hardly their &quot;guiding principle&quot;.  I would suppose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there are many people in the Bush administration,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just as there were many in the Clinton administration,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose view of their political adversaries is so jaundiced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they would be quite happy if events moved in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direction that allowed them to merely arrest their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents.  However, even the most rabid of them understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's still practically unthinkable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is worse than that.  Laws are on the books to prosecute any 
<br>
of us at any time with or without such formalities as an actual 
<br>
arrest, due process and all of that.  All your assets can be 
<br>
seized and you can be disappeared without any formal proceedings 
<br>
indefinitely.  Any of us can have our property seized, all of 
<br>
it, at any time by law.  Any of us can have all aspects of our 
<br>
lives tracked and monitored, all of our communication and 
<br>
relationships fully scrutinized and without so much as a court 
<br>
order.  It is not a matter of what party will use this.  It is a 
<br>
matter of We the People now officially having the status of 
<br>
utterly disenfranchised serfs.  Actually, worse than serfs. 
<br>
Serfs weren't taxed for more than 10% of their income.  Every 
<br>
bit of freedom we have is being formally disavowed and we sit 
<br>
and argue with whether or not anyone will actually abuse us now 
<br>
that we are nearly utterly disenfranchised and disarmed.  This 
<br>
country was not built on trusting to the good intentions of the 
<br>
politicians!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Now some people on this list will instantly retort &quot;OH YEAH?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IT'S BECOMING MORE THINKABLE WITH EACH PASSING MOMENT!&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But perhaps progress can be made by imagining in the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistic manner just what events could transpire that would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give these people the opportunity to begin rounding up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their opponents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thinkable?  Why on earth would any sane person waste their time 
<br>
on what is &quot;thinkable&quot;.  According to the tools we have allowed 
<br>
into government hands all of us are now formally and not just 
<br>
cladestinely at risk from our supposed &quot;public servants&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (1) The country becomes palpably involved in a life-or-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     death struggle.  E.g., Japanese troops in 1942 finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     conquer Denver, with Dallas-Fort Worth soon to fall.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Or an evil third-world terrorist group succeeds in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     smuggling in so many atomic bombs that they begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     going off one every two days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     In either of these scenarios, most Western governments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     at least those with any backbone such as the U.S., would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     crack down on any---repeat, any---effort that appeared
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     in the slightest way to hinder the war effort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You claim this is good or what this country purports to be 
<br>
about?  This country has zero right to do any such cracking down 
<br>
on those who oppose any or all of its policies and actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (2) Polarization evolves to many, many times the level
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     it's ever been in the U.S.  For example, the anti-Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     crowd becomes so vehement in their denunciations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the &quot;illegal cowboy who seized control of the Presidency&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     that they rebel;  or, vice-versa (since I *do* understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     what bias is, unlike some people), the right-wing, up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and including a majority of the people, becomes so rabid
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     that they literally see peace demonstrators and liberals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     as enemy apparatchiks working against the interests of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     U.S. to the degree that they are as big a threat as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     literal terrorists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am not anti-Bush or anti-American.  I am pro-freedom.  The 
<br>
government is amassing enough power, hell, it has amassed it and 
<br>
is  now boldly declaring its willingness to use it, to utterly 
<br>
suppress any and all contrary designs and intentions of the 
<br>
people.   It is not just about this or that group with contrary 
<br>
views.  It is about the end of freedom in our time if we do not 
<br>
wake up and quickly.  Even now it may be too late.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; At present, I see almost zero chance of scenarios like these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>So you feel all safe and secure?  Poor innocent lamb!
