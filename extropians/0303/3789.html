</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  But first stem cells, then biotech based whole genome engineering [1],
<br>
then nanotech [2].
<br>
<p>*But* the technology we need to do [1] does exist *now* (you'll just have
<br>
to trust me on this).  Turning it into something &quot;most&quot; people (e.g. molecular
<br>
biologists) can use is a 3-5 year development effort.  Its a much less
<br>
difficult problem than Apollo was -- by several orders of magnitude.
<br>
(Now taking those tools and turning them into cures for aging -- that
<br>
I view as being perhaps larger than Apollo -- *but* not that much larger.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As I write in my website, gerontology needs its Sputnik.
</em><br>
<p>Also agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, Robert, are you going to Cambridge for the IABG conference in September?
</em><br>
<p>Am not sure at this time, I was at the one in AU but not the one that I think
<br>
was in Korea.  Would like to get to the UK but am not sure I can make it happen.
<br>
But Aubrey is putting together a very good program -- you should go if you have
<br>
the opportunity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; PS: I seem to be missing some posts. Does anyone else have this problem?
</em><br>
<p>Posts run behind what gets placed on the Javien (or probably the BBS or
<br>
Lucifer servers).  Suspect (given problems Brett has had lately) that
<br>
this is due to UCE/SPAM clogging up the server and/or recipient machines.
