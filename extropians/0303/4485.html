<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Screw Vietnam.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well that certainly seems to be the general attitude of most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Americans, then and now.  Who cares?  They aren't people, right?
</em><br>
<p>Why exaggerate the attitudes of those you disagree
<br>
with?  After all, you have *plenty* of good points
<br>
in the following. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Never mind that millions of Indochinese people were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slaughtered and enslaved.  They weren't Americans, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didnt know any of them, right?
</em><br>
<p>That's not the reason that so many liberals can't get
<br>
excited about them, and prefer never to think about
<br>
what happened there.
<br>
<p>The real reason is that to bring all that up does nothing
<br>
to criticize the great Imperialist power, the U.S.  How
<br>
would exposing real crimes of Saddam's regime, or China's
<br>
or the other Communist regimes help deflate the U.S.?
<br>
As some (a few, granted) on this list have actually
<br>
described it, the &quot;most genocidal nation in history&quot;, the
<br>
one currently ruled by &quot;inhuman paranoid and future war
<br>
criminals&quot;, what matters is only whether or not the
<br>
influence of the United States is curtailed or not.
<br>
<p>Suppose, for example, that (for some unknown reason) the
<br>
Bush administration concluded that a frightful slaughter
<br>
of many thousands of people was underway in, say, Ruwanda,
<br>
and that the U.S. should take over that country for a
<br>
period of years.  Would there be worldwide protests? 
<br>
Would there be people on this list savagely denouncing
<br>
the U.S.?   Of course not.  We know this; because: are
<br>
they criticizing (or even conscious of) France doing the
<br>
same thing in the Ivory Coast?  No, of course not.
<br>
<p>Well, why not?  Well, I will tell you why not.  Because taking
<br>
over Ruwanda to suppress genocide would not in any way advance
<br>
the interests of the U.S. in the world situation.  Therefore,
<br>
it would be unobjectionable!
<br>
<p>I was recessed from this list when Clinton invaded Bosnia.
<br>
Were the same usual suspects making a fuss then?  (I really
<br>
would like to know, thanks.)
<br>
<p>Your list of &quot;rights&quot; is quite telling:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm sure such a list of lost rights just after the fall of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saigon might have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - the right not to have your skull bashed in by the
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;butt of rifle
<br>
<em>&gt; - the right to not have to dig your own grave before
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being executed as an 'enemy of the people'
<br>
<em>&gt; - the right to propery, speech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - the right to not be enslaved and forced into peasant
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;farming
<br>
<em>&gt; - the right to life of nearly 1 million people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A similiar list in Cambodia might have added
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - The right to more than a quarter cup of rotten corn every day
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - the right to express feelings of an emotional nature to
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;loved ones (The Khmer Rouge would often execute anyone for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;public displays of affection, as it demonstrated that they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;valued something more than the state)
<br>
<p>Were the liberals in the streets protesting that?  Of course not.
<br>
Again, the only reason I can think of (why not) is that it wouldn't
<br>
be against U.S. foreign policy to do such a thing.  So why do it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - the right to express sorrow at the news of the loss of a
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;child without being executed, a child who had been carted
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;off to a distant slave labor farm and surprisingly died
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;despite his healthy quarter cup of rotten corn every day
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(again, expressing grief at the loss of a child demonstrated
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that someone loved themselves or their children more than
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the state)
<br>
<em>&gt; - the right to life for 2 - 3 million Cambodians
</em><br>
<p>Nah, who cares about them?  Despite certain distortions perpetrated
<br>
by some, their deaths had nothing to do with the wickedness of U.S.
<br>
foreign policy---so why make a stink about it?
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>(The last paragraph was heavily sarcastic.)
