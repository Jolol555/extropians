<br>
<p><em>&gt;Would it be fair to characterise your position as being scornful not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of international law them but of law generally?
</em><br>
<p>No not at all, I obey most laws even laws I don't like because I'm afraid of
<br>
the consequences if I don't.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;But perhaps with some extra contempt for international law
</em><br>
<p>I don't have contempt for international law and who knows someday it might
<br>
actually exist but it doesn't now. I don't have contempt for the
<br>
international suggestions that do actually exist either, in fact some of
<br>
them are quite wise but laws they are not.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Me:
<br>
<em>  &gt;&gt; And you may recall that between April and July of 1994 more
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;&gt; than 800,000 people were murdered in the genocide in
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;&gt; Rwanda, the UN refused to do anything about it
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't think that it was a case of the UN refusing though
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was it? Did anyone try and take the case to the UN do you know?
</em><br>
<p>It was the UN's baby, there were already UN peacekeepers in the Rwanda. On
<br>
Jan 11 1994, 3 months before the slaughter began the head of the UN
<br>
peacekeepers sent a cable to Secretary-General Kofi Annan warning of
<br>
impending genocide, Annan gave orders not to interfere.  A few years later
<br>
the new Rwandan government demanded a apology from the UN. The UN set up a
<br>
commission headed by a former Swedish Prime Minister to investigate itself
<br>
and concluded the UN had ignored evidence genocide was being planned and
<br>
once started had done nothing to stop it. International law in action.
<br>
<p><em>            &gt;I repeat the UN was not set up to protect individual US
</em><br>
<em>            &gt;citizens from attack.
</em><br>
<p>Then we need something else to do that, like a well aimed cruse missile.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;I am not disputing for a moment that the citizens of the US have
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;been attacked by terrorists [.] My criticism of Bush is more
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;that he is a leader that takes on too much collateral damage.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, maybe not. It is clear the world would be better off if Saddam and
<br>
his 2 creepy sons lost power but it's not clear how high a price we must pay
<br>
to do that, but we will find out quite soon now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;My point is that President Bush more than any other leader had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunity to put real force into the UN
</em><br>
<p>But if France has the veto why would he want to do that? No international
<br>
law is better than bad international law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I don't know if we'd agree that it was a mistake for him to take the course
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that he did. Because so far I don't think you have stated a position on it.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't because I don't know if this war is a smart thing to do or not,
<br>
but we're going to find out that's for sure.
