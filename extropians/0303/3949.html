</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - The farmers in the poor countries will lose the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and so will lose their motivation for being farmers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Thus adding to the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - The farmers in the rich countries will not get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reasonable price for their products, as it is given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; away to the poor, and so will lose their motivation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for being farmers.
</em><br>
<p>Quite right.  You simultaneously destroy the incentives
<br>
of both the producer and the consumer.  Very efficient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; in the areas where famine happens, governments (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect, if not always in fact) seize the food that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was going to the poor and sell it for their own profit.
</em><br>
<p>In retrospect, it seems incredible that we could not
<br>
see that this was very likely going to be the result.
<br>
But the pressing question is still, what *can* be
<br>
done in cases of famine?  Are we to just turn our
<br>
backs?  (Unless you invade, what other option is there?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's a distribution problem - as in, a problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the actual physical distribution.  In effect, those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under famine are being deprived of the right to buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; food, as we would understand &quot;buy&quot; (which includes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to use what one buys without having it taken
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away).
</em><br>
<p>But how are they wealthy enough to order food from
<br>
another continent?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This highlights one of the primary differences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among the world's governments: those who desire their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens to flourish and who live off the generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excess, versus those who desire their own wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard of living first and foremost with little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard for that of the governed.
</em><br>
<p>Somehow, I can't really believe that it comes down
<br>
to the *motivations* of the rulers.  Do you really
<br>
think that George Bush or Al Gore has a niceness
<br>
gene missing in third-world country dictators?
<br>
Instead, it's a systemic problem being steadily
<br>
uncovered by only the most perceptive among us,
<br>
namely people like Hernando De Soto, William Easterly,
<br>
and Thomas Bethel (&quot;Private Property: The Noblest
<br>
Triumph&quot;).
<br>
<p>Some countries have (1) rule of law  (2) enormously
<br>
strong forces for the protection of individual rights
<br>
and private property.  I can't think of a single word
<br>
in that formula that can be omitted.
