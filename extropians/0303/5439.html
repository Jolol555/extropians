<p><em>&gt; Who owns the major media?  You may consider them leftist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I consider them more opportunist.
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree.  Compared to the opportunities to make money,
<br>
I don't see the owners of papers and other media outlets in
<br>
the west having any interest whatsoever in ideology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly the policies of the owners of the media are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal.  If they condone a liberal voice in the publication,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is not out of affection for the message, but in order to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) keep control of what can be said, and 2) earn money selling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you say (1)?  I think that they (the owners) are only
<br>
concerned about (2).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most ostensibly liberal publications will suddenly turn very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative when recommending who or what to vote for.  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't say centrist, because that wasn't what I meant.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  I've seen the attempted link between ownership and political
<br>
allegiance made many times.  It's not the owners.  It's the reporters.
<br>
It's they who went to journalism school.  It's they who (in many cases)
<br>
decided to become a reporter in order to &quot;change the world&quot;.  And
<br>
finally, it's they whose biases affect all the reporting done
<br>
off the editorial pages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But one expects capital intensive operations to be owned by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone with a bunch of capital.  And one expects such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person to be rather conservative.  
</em><br>
<p>Just so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And, given the low rate of return of most newspapers, one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expects most of the owner's attention to be given to more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remunerative enterprises.  [Well, I don't know about that!]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I feel that any assertion that things work in a different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way requires extra proof.
</em><br>
<p>I think that those of us who contribute to lists like this have
<br>
a tendency to put ideology (that is, ideas) much higher on our
<br>
list of priorities than do these capitalists.
<br>
<p>In this way, we are much more similar to the reporters than
<br>
to the owners.  And the entire point of my past posts on this
<br>
topic was the liberal bias of the reporters, the schools of
<br>
reporters, and consequently the media itself.
<br>
