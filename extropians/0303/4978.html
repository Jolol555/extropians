</em><br>
<p>Well, here's a more analytical definition, though it depends on the
<br>
meaning of words like &quot;direct&quot;, &quot;manipulation&quot;. It's actually too narrow,
<br>
though, because it would seemingly exclude things such as deception and
<br>
physical threats of harm. I would consider the latter &quot;indirect&quot; to some
<br>
extent (your drug example I would consider fairly &quot;direct&quot;).
<br>
But - my point is not that you don't know what you would consider
<br>
&quot;violent&quot; - obviously, you do. But my point is that it is better to pay
<br>
attention to all the forces that are interacting, and evaluate the ethics
<br>
overall. Economic forces can harm people, they can be consciously
<br>
directed, etc., so there is no reason they cannot be understood as part of
<br>
the problem (?) of violence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Does a suicide bomber consent to committing suicide?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Yes, presently it is so, although in the future it might be possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to produce suicide bombers by direct neural stimulation.
</em><br>
<p>Well, right here I would break it down - there are parts of the mind that
<br>
may consent to suicide, but there are other parts that don't (my folk use
<br>
of consent). Thus, the suicide bombers sweat and &quot;seem nervous&quot;, which I
<br>
take as evidence of their inner conflict. There is no homogeneous
<br>
&quot;self&quot; and thus no unified &quot;consent&quot;. To the extent that the bomber
<br>
(*any* part of his mind) cannot control all the forces acting upon and
<br>
shaping his mind, his &quot;consent&quot; is not arising from some transcendent
<br>
operational base; it is embedded in the universe at large, its play of
<br>
all forces. Some of those forces can be economic (desire for family to be
<br>
paid a martyr's award, resentment over poverty, training by funded
<br>
suicide-bomber-makers, funding of means of ubiquitous exposure to the
<br>
auxiliary religiemes, purchase of bomb materials, etc.).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Partially, by hanging out in the wrong places and listening to false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prophets. This is essentially irrelevant to the two initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions,since almost all humans are exposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide-bomber-philosophy, yet only a very small minority actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consent to suicide bombing.
</em><br>
<p>No, we're not all exposed to the philosophy. I myself have never seen it
<br>
explicitly stated at length by its devotees. The same applies to the
<br>
&quot;wrong places&quot; (?); many people like myself have never been to a place
<br>
where it was taught, or heard anyone preach it in person.  Ditto for the
<br>
auxiliary factors - my family and friends have not belonged to a religion
<br>
variety in which it was taught at all, or done it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Since a very large number of choices other than suicide bombing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist for absolutely all humans, one's living circumstances are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant as explanation for the consent to suicide-bomb.
</em><br>
<p>I would say: a lot of outcomes are possible for most people since they are
<br>
acted upon by a bewildering, vast array of interacting forces at all
<br>
times, but those forces are the only plausible explanation for any human
<br>
behavior.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Does he consent to only two products of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sort he wants being available?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Yes.
</em><br>
<p><p>Explain. You mean I get to determine every company's product line?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  Does he consent to only one product being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sold practically near to him?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Yes.
</em><br>
<p>Now I control the distribution of stores and their goods?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Does he consent to receiving marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; influences?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Almost always yes, except in some unusual circumstances (children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exposed to marketing at school, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>I determine if and when/where I see billboards' ads and magazine ads and
<br>
TV ads?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Does he consent to acquiring the characteristics that make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; marketing effective?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Explain?
</em><br>
<p>Do people consent to having a hunger motive, or a taste for choclate, so
<br>
that chocolate ice cream sellers can effectively sell chocolate sundaes to
<br>
many people?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### The circuitry we use for determining the subjective feeling of &quot;free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will&quot; and consent is a mental construct, just as all qualia and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concepts. It is not crude, as most humans have the ability to detect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harmful deceit under most circumstances. An individual's feeling of free
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will evolved to provide the best chances for reproduction in competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with similarly endowed individuals. As a result even the least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent persons can only with difficulty be led to self-destructive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acts, and suicide-bombing is quite uncommon. Especially in cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upholding the value of the individual freedom, and rigorous definitions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of violence.
</em><br>
<p>I would say that not all parts of the mind have a sense of free will,
<br>
so-called. I wouldn't argue that it was maladaptive, but I would tend to
<br>
think better/closer analysis of forces operating in the world would tend
<br>
to be more adaptive in most cases. It would have to be VERY refined before
<br>
it would start to erode the sense of &quot;free will&quot;. But a simplistic analogy
<br>
might be people playing a sport or game - they are self-consciously aware
<br>
of the &quot;objective&quot; and they know the rules, and they know what the other
<br>
players are doing, etc., so that there may always be a discernible &quot;best
<br>
move&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Yes, but this doesn't have much relevance to the need of a rigorous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of violence, and rejection of the concept of &quot;economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, for example, wealth can determine a person's desire to commit
<br>
violence (say, to make money, or to keep it, or to get it from others), or
<br>
their ability to commit violence (expensive weapons vs. shabby ones,
<br>
training in violence techniques vs. amateur hour). Thus economic factors
<br>
are crucial in analysis of social forces related to violence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Judgment as to whether an action is violent or not is not aesthetic, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an ethical one, and important in deciding whether violent action may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be used in its prevention.
</em><br>
<p>Ethics is a branch of aesthetics. But - using violence to prevent
<br>
violence? is an oxymoron.  Not that I don't understand your drift (I
<br>
think). We can use one force to try to prevent another force. Some forces
<br>
can enable or disable certain other forces. One man's nonviolence
<br>
(embargo, imprisonment) is another man's violence - prompting
<br>
&quot;self-defense&quot; etc. It would be better for ethics to at least first
<br>
analyze what all the operating forces are, before it decides to label this
<br>
or that pejoratively or amelioratively. In fact, gross-level category
<br>
labeling may be counterproductive altogether.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### It is still not possible to program humans. As a result, marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not make anybody to anything - it merely influences choices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-violently, e.g. by informing about the existence of a product and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price comparisons, and allowing superior choices.
</em><br>
<p>If any marketing strategy has EVER been successful, then it has
<br>
effectively programmed human behvior. The fact that such programming may
<br>
be highly unreliable and distracted by other programming and environmental
<br>
factors in most cases does not change that fact.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It amazes me that the claim is so frequently made, that humans are mere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marionettes at the tug of dark forces, marketers, and conspiracies.
</em><br>
<p>I don't want to be reductionist - to oversimplify the complexity of human
<br>
minds and environmental forces. But the &quot;mechanical&quot; level of analysis is
<br>
real.
