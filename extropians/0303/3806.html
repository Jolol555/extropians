</em><br>
<p>### That is the problem with them - they think they know, where a prudent
<br>
person, concerned about the welfare of both the citizens of the world (in
<br>
the long run) and the welfare of Iraqis (who stand to gain enormously from
<br>
outside intervention), has reasons to doubt either course of action. I think
<br>
I am still slightly, just ever so slightly, against the war (for short-term
<br>
selfish economic reasons, and a worry that this might be the beginning of
<br>
the World Government), but on the other hand, the suffering of innocents now
<br>
and the risk of further nuclear weapon proliferation are almost enough to
<br>
argue for it.
<br>
<p>This is not the clear-cut case of Pearl Harbor (war=good), or Somalia
<br>
intervention (what a stupid idea, now seen in 20/20 hindsight).
