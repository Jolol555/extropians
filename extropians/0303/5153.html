<em>&gt; &gt; This kind of development (and related ones in the music and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; entertainment industries) has far reaching implications IMHO.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It hasn't changed a damn thing in the music business. The tools are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem. Anybody remotely interrested in doing music on a computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do it now for $500. So anybody can make music. And still it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly s*** that we hear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It will be the same for movie making. I fact, you can make tv quality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movies on a home computer with no trouble. You have been able to for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years. So where is all that great cheap content?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Another difference is that we don't have as much time for watching
</em><br>
<em>&gt; movies as we do for hearing music. So most people will be even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indifferent if there are more bad movies made.
</em><br>
<p>This is true. The evidence of the 'print revolution' in Early Modern Europe
<br>
is that the initial result of a new, more accessible way of communicating is
<br>
to simply enormously increase the quantity of  common or garden rubbish put
<br>
into circulation (Sturgeon's Law at work). However (a) after a while this
<br>
wears off (b) the really interesting effect, which happens much sooner, has
<br>
to do with the form of communication and access to it rather than content
<br>
per se. At the moment in developed countries media such as film and TV are
<br>
enormously important for forming beliefs, attitudes and outlooks, above all
<br>
in shaping what counts as 'knowledge' or 'common sense'. This is a serious
<br>
matter as these media are structured in such a way that access to them is
<br>
limited. New technology means that this kind of control is going to be
<br>
increasingly difficult to sustain. As I said, the immediate result is likely
<br>
to be the strengthening of dissident subcultures, many of which we wouldn't
<br>
like but I think the longer term results will be beneficial.
