<em>&gt; Basically every psychedelic drug that has become even slightly popular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the last 30 years was discovered by Shulgin, who used himself and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his friends as guinea pigs.  He did this out of personal enthusiasm.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's no market incentive in the black market to discover new drugs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a matter of custom, those who develop new psychedelic drugs release
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their chemical structures and synthesis steps into the public domain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Even if they didn't, there would be no effective way to protect a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patent on an illegal substance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mez
</em><br>
<p>This could be taken as strong evidence in support of intellectual property
<br>
regulation, in its role as a protector/encourager of innovation. What is
<br>
shown is that, in the absense of any mechanism to protect IP in the area of
<br>
illegal drugs, real innovation is very low.
