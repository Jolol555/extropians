<p><em>&gt; The serial [way to spread memes] looks like this: ----- You start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with one reasonable conclusion, which leads to another, which leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to another, and so on.  Eventually you end up in really wild thinking.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which is reasonable if each step in the chain has been correct.
</em><br>
<p>But is this how we actually *ever* think?  Even in math?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, such long chains are fairly weak rhetorically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They work great in mathematics and areas where one can really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do iron-clad reasoning, but for human matters there is so much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty and differing interpretations that the steps become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fragile.  Even worse, most listeners can't pay attention to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4711 steps of your reasoning, and will only listen to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion - which is too wild. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, it's not how I think.  Not in philosophy, not in chess,
<br>
and not even in mathematics.  Somehow, I always know where I'm
<br>
going before the chains of reasoning start.  An example: yesterday
<br>
I had this intuition that one could prove that a complete
<br>
quadrilateral (in projective geometry) might be shown to contain
<br>
harmonic ratios by use of Ceva's Theorem and Menalaus's Theorem.
<br>
(One draws a triangle, places a point somewhere near the center,
<br>
and then extends lines from each vertex through the point.  If
<br>
you then take any two of these points that result on the sides
<br>
of the triangle, and extend them outside the triangle, then they
<br>
meet, eventually, the side (probably far away from the triangle)
<br>
where the two lines came from.)  How did I get this idea?  Well,
<br>
I had stared at many triangles like this and either remembered
<br>
that a harmonic ratio was set up on this original side (or else
<br>
it just began to look that way).  So I fooled around with Ceva's
<br>
Theorem and Menalaus's theorem, and sure enough, eventually I
<br>
had a proof that indeed, just as you describe, has 4711 steps in
<br>
it (fewer, actually).
<br>
<p>Okay, so how did I get into cryonics?  Did I go through 4711
<br>
logical steps?  No way!  It took about two minutes' thinking.
<br>
I was already a materialist, I already thought that future
<br>
technology probably could accomplish things beyond our wildest
<br>
dreams, and presto!  The rest was obvious.  Did I want to live,
<br>
or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The parallel way is like this: ||||| (I turned it 90 degrees to fit it)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lots of short arguments that start out from the current world, and show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how a small, reasonable step leads to a slightly different world. They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not all fit together or be strong arguments (just because people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend $$$ on nanotechnology it doesn't have to become useful), but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reinforce each other and show that there is a big field of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities. Often the listener responds by suggesting their own short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; step, and you can start building serial arguments *together* instead. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I would stress the almost-unconscious nature of all those
<br>
small arguments.  Suppose that some Luddite regularly reads the
<br>
Extropian list for years.  Thousands of little tiny facts will 
<br>
come to his attention, or perhaps just receive much more emphasis
<br>
than he's ever seen placed on them before, and slowly his whole
<br>
outlook changes.  Then at some fine time in the future, it suddenly
<br>
only takes him two minutes also to see the value of cryonics, or
<br>
the inevitability of a Singularity.
<br>
<p>Now suppose that I were quite impressionable, and had no huge list
<br>
of memes, knowledge, and Darwinian ideas, and read over and over
<br>
intelligent commentary on a religious forum.  Then by and by the
<br>
same thing would happen to me, only in the reverse direction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most people are never convinced by a long logical deduction, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are convinced by seeing evidence or ideas again and again.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly so.  The only purpose that I know of to lay out all
<br>
the arguments carefully in a long thesis is to reassure the believers.
<br>
(In math, there is one additional reason:  to become absolutely
<br>
certain of something you already believe.  Andrew Wiles already
<br>
strongly believed in Fermat's Last Theorem, and intuited that he
<br>
was just inches away from proving it.)
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think Gregory Stock makes a good demonstration of this in his book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Redesigning Humans_: lots of here-and-now technologies and ideas that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each are fairly reasonable and likely, but together lead to a transhuman
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future.
