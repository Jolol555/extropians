<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can then ask, what percentage of instantiations of a given world X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in the real universe versus in simulations?  This is a question
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is answerable in principle, at least if we stick to a simple form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of parallelism like Tegmark's level one (namely that in a spatially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite universe, all possible worlds exist an infinite number of times).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You'd have to estimate what fraction of worlds evolve intelligent life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forms capable of performing such simulations.  These would include worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose past history is identical to our own but which are farther along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their developmental path because they got started a little earlier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They would have seen a slightly younger universe than we do now, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the uncertainties, they could easily be at least many thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of years ahead of us and still have us be a valid model of their past.
</em><br>
<p>### I remember discussing exactly this issue about a year and a half ago
<br>
here, with scerir, in relation to Nick Bostrom's then released article about
<br>
living in simulations. I argued that his conclusion that we are very likely
<br>
in a simulation, based on the anthropic principle, is hard to justify, and I
<br>
mentioned Vilenkin's eternal expansion as a counter-argument. I argued that
<br>
we have very inadequate basis for estimating the fraction of N/S, where N is
<br>
the number of civilizations created naturally, and S is the number of
<br>
simulations. The way I see it now, a large N/S would mean that either we
<br>
will die soon, or if we don't die we won't be running many simulations, or
<br>
else we indeed *are* likely to be in a simulation. The second possibility is
<br>
most interesting as a way of predicting future development in ethics - if we
<br>
don't run simulations despite being alive, and we do not enter technological
<br>
stasis (this would be an unlikely event IMO - we will either grow or die),
<br>
then the reason for not running them would be ethical, and pertinent to a
<br>
large fraction of cvilizations.Would it mean that transhuman ethical
<br>
development precludes simulations?
<br>
<p>Of course, since we can't for now dis(prove) being simulated, this is all
<br>
just hazy theo(log)(r)ising.
