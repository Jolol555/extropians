Ramez writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm not trying to be callous here.  I care about people, even those I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't met, and I do my small bit to help eliminate needless death.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But individuals die.  They always have and they always will.
</em><br>
<p>Given the kinds of technology that might control our solar
<br>
system in only a century, this would turn out to be false.
<br>
Individuals might very well *never* die.  The cryonics and
<br>
immortalist literature has dealt with this for decades.
<br>
<p>For example, when humans are uploaded they'll have enough
<br>
secure backup copies that the probability of death drops
<br>
very close to zero.  We should keep this goal before us.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Alternately, when you [Eliezer] said &quot;humanity&quot; did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you mean the human species?  If so, should we care?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I care about individuals.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, so do I.  And this definitely includes one Ramez
<br>
Naam, for example.  Absolutely no one should look upon
<br>
our present situation as certain death sentence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If those individuals are AIs or post-humans or such,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is that any worse than if those individuals are humans?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see why.  But maybe I'm unusual in having more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sentience-loyalty than species-loyalty.
</em><br>
<p>Don't you see the frightful logic that you are allowing
<br>
yourself to carelessly embrace?  It's as though Montezuma
<br>
and his Indios friends had said, &quot;It will be good if we
<br>
continue to live, but does it really matter if the Spanish
<br>
live instead, and we die?&quot;
<br>
<p>Why isn't there room for everyone to live?  As Feynman
<br>
said, &quot;there's plenty of room at the bottom&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then [this advanced alien] gives you [the primate precursor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to humans] the choice.  Should humanity be allowed to come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into being or not?  I would choose yes.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent choice.  But it need not be at ours, or anyone's
<br>
expense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Today, I would rather see creatures with more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, awareness, creativity, passion, and curiosity than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans come into being.  I don't want to do so in a way that hurts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people,
</em><br>
<p>Then don't embrace sub-optimal solutions!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but I know that evolution goes hand in hand with strife.
</em><br>
<p>Not after we get control of it!  At least, not necessarily.
<br>
Death can become as Popper said of ideas:  &quot;It is better
<br>
to let them die in our stead.&quot;   So particular algorithms
<br>
can either not be run, or be put on an extinction schedule
<br>
(i.e., if X is the algorithm that you deem in your own
<br>
space to be less worthy of run time, then you begin issuing
<br>
X one second of run time only every 10^n seconds, for 
<br>
increasing integer n).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the choice between humanity continuing in its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current form for millennia vs. humanity succumbing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to a post-human type of life, I'd choose the latter.
</em><br>
<p>Well, as Rafal would say, nix the choice!  This isn't a
<br>
thought experiment, and there need not be a hard choice.
<br>
<p>Lee
