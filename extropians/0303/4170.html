&nbsp;what percentage of people in the world think that if the international

&nbsp;community fails to act firmly now against the UNITED STATES, then the world 
<br>
&nbsp;will become a more dangerous place in years to come?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;Arti,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;None of that matters.  What counts is that the US is the one that has 
<br>
&nbsp;been shot at, hit, lost citizenry/visitors, and is being aimed at again.  
<br>
&nbsp;That you wish to knock off the US, aren't concerned with American loss of 
<br>
&nbsp;life and don't like us anyway means nothing.  
<br>
&nbsp;Have a good day,
<br>

<em>  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ron,
<br>
<p>Up until now I have refrained from responding on any of your commentary thus 
<br>
far, but I think this one takes the cake and is deserving of a reply.Your 
<br>
obvious lack of reading comprehension skills and penchant for putting words 
<br>
in people's mouths makes you sound like more of a buffoon than ever before. 
<br>
<p>Point #1: I think that the opinion of the world's human beings matters very 
<br>
much. Unfortunately, there will never be a completely honest representation 
<br>
of people's opinions in any poll for obvious reasons.
<br>
<p>Point #2: Nowhere in my post did I EVER state that I &quot;wish[ed] to knock off 
<br>
the US&quot; as you seem to think I did. I think I stated my intentions rather 
<br>
plainly in the original post. Read more carefully next time.
<br>
<p>Point #3: I am not only concerned with the loss of American lives, but the 
<br>
lives of EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET. If war can be averted at any 
<br>
cost then THAT is the road we need to take for HUMANITY'S sake. We need to 
<br>
stop slaughtering eachother over bullshit ideological, religious, or 
<br>
otherwise dogmatic reasons.
<br>
<p>Point #4: I think you have the misconception that I am not an American 
<br>
Citizen. The only kinds of people I dislike are ignorant, close-minded, and 
<br>
blindly patriotic, but... this is America and everyone is entitled to their 
<br>
opinion as long as it's not forced down our throats. Would I be better off as 
<br>
a citizen of another country? I surely don't know.
<br>
<p>Ron, why exactly are you still on this list? It seems to me that much of the 
<br>
rhetoric I have seen you spouting off recently seems to have very little with 
<br>
core Extropian values and a lot to do with you being pissed off at the way 
<br>
the world is today. YES I agree with you, the world is a pretty messed up 
<br>
place, YES there are lots and lots of bad people out there, and YES there are 
<br>
many forms of injustice out there, however, I do NOT agree with ANY 
<br>
government who decides to KILL to support their own brand of dogma, INCLUDING 
<br>
the United States. I also am very disconcerted about the direction the 
<br>
current US administration and it's agents are taking this country are taking 
<br>
in regards to our civil liberties. I don't think I have to lecture you on the 
<br>
importance of rational arguments on these issues and the rights of the people 
<br>
to petition the government for a redress of grievances if they have a problem 
<br>
with the way things are going. I hope that those of us who truly care about 
<br>
these and other rights make their voices heard loud and clear before those 
<br>
same rights are taken away from us by policies that are bordering on Fascism.
<br>
<p>If you don't like it when someone like me wants to try to get a balanced view 
<br>
of the issues by attmpting to obtain information from sources outside of 
<br>
their general sphere of resources, then I suggest you stop reading any more 
<br>
emails and simply rely on CBS news or wherever you go to shop for your daily 
<br>
dose of yellow journalism. Of course, you are more than welcome to 
<br>
participate in a Flame War with me, but it will be a rather futile exercise 
<br>
(you can't have a war with only one side fighting!), so I would encourage you 
<br>
to maintain your dignity and stop before you start.
<br>
<p>With all due respect,
<br>
<p>Artillo
