<br>
<p><p>On a serious note, I will say that if this study is accurate, then we do
<br>
really need to do something to mitigate the impact of this over the long
<br>
term, and I mean 'we' in the sense of us extropes, being the most pro-tech
<br>
pro-solution types around. Or does something need to not be done?
<br>
<p>At the present time, though, the impact seems to be exclusively at the
<br>
poles. Equatorial regions record little or no increase in temperature, despite
<br>
receiving the brunt of the increased irradiance. It is, rather, that heat is
<br>
being stopped up from radiating to space at the poles.
<br>
<p>Atmospheric data show that while high polar altitudes are getting colder,
<br>
lower altitudes are getting warmer, indicating that there is a greenhouse
<br>
effect occuring in the polar regions.
<br>
<p>At the same time, there is a problem of ozone holes at the poles allowing in
<br>
increased UV, which kills off much plankton, upon which the ecosystems of
<br>
both poles depend and is a major factor in carbon sequestration in the polar
<br>
regions.
<br>
<p>Experts say that the problem of CFCs destroying ozone in the polar regions
<br>
will self repair within a decade or two, so long as humans maintain a ban on
<br>
CFC use. So, it appears that nothing further needs to be done to resolve the
<br>
current greenhouse effect problem. If we find that having temperate climates
<br>
in arctic regions is beneficial (more agricultural area, more seacoast to
<br>
develop, etc), we might even desire to INCREASE CFC release.
<br>
<p>There is a longer term problem though that is real but not as dire as many
<br>
claim.
<br>
<p>CO2 is a greenhouse gas, but too many assume that its impact is linear. They
<br>
assume that an x percent increase in CO2 concentrations will result in an
<br>
equal increase in the greenhouse effect. This simply is not the case. The
<br>
assumption of a linear relationship is what contributes to the &quot;melting
<br>
icecaps will flood the world&quot; predictions of many.
<br>
<p>In fact, increasing CO2 concentrations have a diminishing returns
<br>
effect. Every additional percent increase results in increasingly reduced
<br>
additional impact on thermal retention. This is the exact opposite of
<br>
compounding interest. This means that there will be a problem, but its impact
<br>
won't have any kind of seriousness for humanity for several centuries at the
<br>
very least.
<br>
<p>The fact that this is a longer term problem suggests two things:
<br>
a) it is more cost effective to wait for more advanced technologies to deal
<br>
with the problem in the future, if it continues to be a problem at all.
<br>
b) since we know the sun's output is cyclic (see Milankovic Cycles), it is
<br>
entirely possible that by the time CO2 levels reach serious levels, we will
<br>
need that protection against an impending ice age.
