Hi Extropes,
<br>
<p>I've been keeping an eye open for a reasonably good description
<br>
of the legal ramifications of any &quot;unilateral&quot; decision to take military
<br>
action against Iraq. And the following (below) couched in terms of
<br>
&nbsp;a PR and open letter to Kofi Annan seems to fit the bill.
<br>
<p>It is clear to me (following discussions with several international law
<br>
professors and posting reading the American Society of Interantional
<br>
Law ASIL list that almost all legal opinion I can find on the matter
<br>
where the arguments rather than puffery and qualifications are offered
<br>
in lieu) that it would be a breach of the UN Charter for the US and
<br>
the UK and other countries to launch a military action against Iraq in
<br>
the current circumstances.
<br>
<p>President Bush and Prime Ministers Blair and Howard are all on
<br>
record as saying that sufficient legal authority exists already to authorise
<br>
military action without further UN resolutins but so far as I can tell they
<br>
are all wrong in this and none of them are willing to make their legal
<br>
advice public. This is politically understandable but democratically
<br>
unhealthy. (Justice being seen to be done etc). Politicians may *like*
<br>
deniability an reduced accountability but it can hardly be healthy for
<br>
their citizens and for open societies to let them have it.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Brett Paatsch

<p>Northampton, Massachusetts USA 01060
<br>
<p><p><p>The Hon. Kofi A. Annan
<br>
<p>Secretary-General of the United Nations
<br>
<p>United Nations Headquarters
<br>
<p>New York, New York 10017
<br>
<p><p><p>March 10, 2003
<br>
<p><p><p>Dear Mr. Secretary-General,
<br>
<p><p><p>Because the legal authority of the United Nations is being challenged today
<br>
by the threat of an illegal war against Iraq, the onset of which arguably
<br>
would pose the most serious threat to world legal order since World War II,
<br>
and
<br>
<p><p><p>Considering that,
<br>
<p><p><p>(a)    United Nations Charter Article 99 stipulates &quot;The Secretary-General
<br>
may bring to the attention of the Security Council any matter which in his
<br>
opinion may threaten the maintenance of international peace and security&quot;;
<br>
<p>(b)    Two permanent members of the Security Council, the United States of
<br>
America and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, have
<br>
repeatedly threatened the use of force against a United Nations member
<br>
state, Iraq, without Security Council authorization in violation of United
<br>
Nations Charter Article 2, paragraph 4, which stipulates &quot;All members shall
<br>
refrain in their international relations from the threat or use of force
<br>
against the territorial integrity or political independence of any state, or
<br>
in any other manner inconsistent with the Purposes of the United Nations&quot;;
<br>
<p>(c)    No Security Council resolution issued since 1991 has authorized the
<br>
threat or use of force against Iraq;
<br>
<p>(d)    The claim that Security Council Resolution 1441 (2002) authorizes the
<br>
automatic use of force against Iraq on the basis of its renewed warning that
<br>
Iraq &quot;will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations
<br>
of its obligations&quot; is unsupported by the resolution's drafting history
<br>
(travaux préparatoires), inconsistent with the plain and natural meaning of
<br>
the warning's text (cast in recollective rather than directive terms and
<br>
making no mention of the use of armed force per se), and, in any event,
<br>
contradicted by the post-adoption interpretative practice of a majority of
<br>
the Security Council, including three-fifths of its permanent members;
<br>
<p>(e)    Iraq has not attacked any state since 1990; it has neither attacked
<br>
nor threatened to attack either the United States or the United Kingdom, and
<br>
possesses no military capability to engage in an armed attack of either the
<br>
United States or the United Kingdom;
<br>
<p>(f)     Claims that Iraq intends to attack, or is capable of attacking, the
<br>
United States or any state with weapons of mass destruction on its own or
<br>
indirectly by providing such weapons to an international terrorist network
<br>
are speculative, and are not supported by credible evidence;
<br>
<p>(g)    An American or British resort to a &quot;preventive&quot; use of force,
<br>
including an armed attack of Iraq, as a response to a speculative,
<br>
prospective terrorist threat from Iraq would violate the United Nations
<br>
Charter and fundamental principles of international law with respect to the
<br>
prohibition of the use of force;
<br>
<p>(h)    While state practice may authorize a &quot;preemptive&quot; use of force to
<br>
offset an immediate short-term threat, this claim is at best controversial
<br>
and, in any event, there is no international law precedent justifying a
<br>
&quot;preventive&quot; use of force against a long-term threat, least of all a
<br>
speculative one;
<br>
<p>(i)      United Nations Charter Article 51 stipulates that states are
<br>
permitted to threaten or use force only &quot;if an armed attack occurs&quot; and
<br>
&quot;only until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to maintain
<br>
international peace and security&quot;; in this context, American and British
<br>
claims that Iraq's failure to comply with its disarmament obligations as
<br>
stipulated in a series of Security Council resolutions constitutes a casus
<br>
belli are inconsistent with the United Nations Charter or customary
<br>
principles of international law with respect to the use of force;
<br>
<p>(j)      No Security Council resolution with respect to Iraq identifies Iraq
<br>
's failure to comply with its disarmament obligations to the United Nations
<br>
as a casus belli;
<br>
<p>(k)    A resort to force in the absence of Security Council authorization
<br>
and any credible evidence of an imminent threat of armed attack would not
<br>
only violate the United Nations Charter, it would also constitute a war of
<br>
aggression and, thus, a crime against peace under the Nuremberg precedent;
<br>
<p>(l)      Alternative solutions to achieve the disarmament of weapons of mass
<br>
destruction in Iraq are available and have not been exhausted, including
<br>
diplomatic pressure, negotiations, sanctions on certain goods with military
<br>
applications, destruction of stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, and
<br>
inspections of facilities with capabilities to assist in production of
<br>
weapons of mass destruction; and
<br>
<p>(m) The United Nations has achieved considerably more disarmament success in
<br>
Iraq than the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have
<br>
claimed, as reported by the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and
<br>
Inspection Commission, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and the
<br>
Amorim Panel report (March 1999), which concluded &quot;The bulk of Iraq's
<br>
proscribed weapons programme has been eliminated,&quot;
<br>
<p><p><p>We urge you,
<br>
<p><p><p>1.       To encourage in your public remarks the Security Council and all
<br>
United Nations member states to act toward Iraq in a manner that adheres to
<br>
the requirements of the United Nations Charter and international law with
<br>
respect to the threat and use of force;
<br>
<p>2.       To similarly encourage the Security Council to act toward Iraq in a
<br>
manner that reflects the overriding and fundamental purposes of the United
<br>
Nations, stated in United Nations Charter Article 1, &quot;to maintain
<br>
international peace and security,&quot; and &quot;to bring about by peaceful means&quot;
<br>
the settlement of international disputes;
<br>
<p>3.       To invite the General Assembly, in the event of an impasse within
<br>
the Security Council with respect to its deliberations on Iraq, to act under
<br>
Uniting for Peace precedents in response to any ongoing threat or use of
<br>
force against Iraq,
<br>
