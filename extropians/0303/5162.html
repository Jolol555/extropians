Lee Corbin wrote, in another thread:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We *all* have ideological blinders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just some of us refuse to admit it, or aren't aware of it.
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to explore this idea.  What is an ideology?  How does it
<br>
blind us?  And if it does, is this something we should celebrate?
<br>
Or should we try to free ourselves from our ideological blinders?
<br>
Why would anyone choose to be blinded?  And how does this fit with
<br>
Extropian philosophy (or should we say, Extropian ideology?)?
<br>
<p>It's mundane, but we can start with the definition of &quot;ideology&quot; from
<br>
dictionary.com:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;1. The body of ideas reflecting the social needs and aspirations of an
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;individual, group, class, or culture.
<br>
&nbsp;2. A set of doctrines or beliefs that form the basis of a political,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;economic, or other system.
<br>
<p>These suggest a few point that distinguish an ideology from other sorts
<br>
of beliefs.  First, it is generally a collective concept.  An ideology
<br>
is usually shared with others.  In the first definition we see it as
<br>
reflecting *social* needs.  In the second, it is the foundation of a
<br>
*political* or *economic* system, and both are social constructs.
<br>
<p>Not all beliefs are ideologies or parts of ideologies.  Our ideological
<br>
beliefs are those related to our conception of an ideal political,
<br>
economic or social system.  They are beliefs about how humans ought to
<br>
interact with one another on a large scale.
<br>
<p>So where do the blinders come from?  I think the problem is that as a
<br>
social construct, an ideology has a certain degree of self-organizational
<br>
ability.  In memetic terms, a successful ideology has to be able to
<br>
spread, and to maintain and defend itself against challenges.  Ideologies
<br>
aren't just collections of beliefs, they are self-perpetuating entities.
<br>
And one mechanism which they use to protect themselves is to apply
<br>
&quot;blinders&quot; to the people who are their members.
<br>
<p>In the crudest form, ideological blinders prevent someone from seeing and
<br>
thinking about facts which would contradict the ideology.  More subtle
<br>
mechanisms would allow some consideration of such facts, but in an
<br>
extremely skeptical mode where any contrary evidence is weighted
<br>
overwhelmingly higher.  As part of the mechanism, the blinders are
<br>
sometimes imperceptible, so that the ideologue thinks he is considering
<br>
issues dispassionately and objectively.  More often, I think, people are
<br>
at least vaguely aware that they have blinders, but they accept them.
<br>
You often hear people say things like, &quot;my mind's made up about that,
<br>
I don't want to hear any more about it.&quot;
<br>
<p>So this raises the question, why do people accept ideologies that impose
<br>
blinders?  Do they have any choice?  Lee's quote above suggests that
<br>
we do not, that all ideologies impose blinders, and that (presumably)
<br>
we all have an ideology whether we know it or not.  I'm not so sure,
<br>
but I won't push the point right now.  But to toss out a question, what
<br>
if you were unsure about the best economic and political system?  What if
<br>
you were trying to decide?  Is that an ideology, and if so, what blinders
<br>
does it impose?  Or would Lee deny that anyone could be in that state?
<br>
<p>As far as why people do accept ideologies, I can see several reasons.
<br>
One is a desire for group membership.  An ideology is a sort of modern
<br>
equivalent of a tribe, dividing the world into fellow tribesmen versus
<br>
outsiders.  It allows us to take some of our oldest instincts and
<br>
apply them to the rather confusing, complex and varied modern world.
<br>
Another reason is that the state of uncertainty is uncomfortable for
<br>
many people.  Reaching a decision on these matters, even an incorrect
<br>
one, may be valuable in itself.  And then having made the decision,
<br>
the blinders serve to increase the comfort level.
<br>
<p>And after all, being wrong about ideology is one of the more harmless
<br>
errors one can make, for most people.  Most of us have practically no
<br>
influence on the kind of questions that ideologies address, about the
<br>
large scale structure of society.  We can be totally wrong and nothing
<br>
will happen, because we have no opportunity to put our beliefs into
<br>
action.  Why put huge efforts into these questions when the results
<br>
don't matter?  It may actually make evolutionary sense to shut down
<br>
discussion of these issues by freezing our beliefs and refusing to
<br>
consider contrary facts.
<br>
<p>However, as Extropians, I think we should take a different approach.
<br>
Our philosophy is not oriented towards comfort.  Rather, it is constantly
<br>
involved in challenging the status quo.  Extropianism is far from
<br>
mainstream, even though it has come a long way towards acceptance in
<br>
the past 15 years.  Extropians should be willing to accept intellectual
<br>
challenge and be reluctant to take the easy road which most people follow.
<br>
<p>To the degree that people follow ideologies for the reasons above,
<br>
we as Extropians should reject that approach.  If our belief systems
<br>
tend to impose blinders, we should do what we can to free ourselves from
<br>
those limitations.  We should all consider what methods can best achieve
<br>
these goals.  Just to refer back to the message from which I spun off
<br>
this thread, I do listen to both Democracy Now and to Rush Limbaugh on
<br>
the radio.  It's a mind-stretching experience that I highly recommend.
<br>
<p>Still there is the worrisome possibility that Lee is right, that
<br>
ultimately all such struggle is futile, that we will still be bound
<br>
by an ideology and that at best we can only fool ourselves that we
<br>
are freeing ourself from blinders.  It's almost like some of the Zen
<br>
beliefs that it is impossible through struggle to free yourself from the
<br>
illusion of the world, for struggle only binds you more tightly to it.
<br>
No one can be told what the Matrix is.
<br>
<p>Even in these ancient (and not so ancient) stories there is usually a way
<br>
out, though; the rabbit hole of the Matrix, the Nirvana of the Buddhists.
<br>
I think we would seek a more structured approach, whether Bayesian
<br>
reasoning or pan-critical rationalism or some other name.  And if we
<br>
ultimately cannot totally free ourselves from the bondage imposed by an
<br>
ideology, we can still strive to expand our minds and reduce limitations.
<br>
As an Extropian, I won't settle for less.
<br>
<p>Hal
