Samantha,
<br>
<p>this idea you correctly identify as dangerous cannot be stopped at this
<br>
point in time, barring armed conflict.  The only way to avoid the grasp of
<br>
the world's govt's is to hide from them.
<br>
<p>imo, this is one of several uber-important reasons that humanity needs to
<br>
get established off-planet, preferably in the asteroid belt and/or oort
<br>
cloud, where resources are plentiful and bothering someone takes inordinate
<br>
amounts of effort
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What really needs to be stopped is the very idea, any legitimacy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; granted at all to the idea that it is a reasonable function of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government, within the purview of government to wield any such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; broad powers.  As long as it is excepted as legitimate there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will always be the danger of such irresponsible massive blows.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do not give as fickle and dangerous a Beast as government this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of power.  Chain it and quickly.   How?  There's the rub.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
