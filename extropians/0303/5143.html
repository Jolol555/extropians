Brett Paatsch lays down the challenge for the concept of
<br>
*international law* to be given a fair hearing.  In it
<br>
he especially warns of the two frequent evolution of our
<br>
society towards the position that the law is something
<br>
only judges and lawyers are permitted to fully understand
<br>
or appreciate---a kind of new nobility capable of interpreting
<br>
all that is above the heads of the rest of us.
<br>
<p>Certainly our constitutions and our laws *MUST* be interpretable
<br>
and understandable by lay people.  The law is, as Lincoln said,
<br>
by the people and for the people.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  And for all those who think that Bush is a complete moron,
<br>
it's probable that he has more respect and understanding of
<br>
international law than you do.

<em>&gt; Subject: [War/Politics] Is the war legal or illegal? Decide for yourself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hi Extropes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whilst I may continue to debate with some other list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members the relevance and importance of international law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is worth pointing out that international law exists. (It is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bases of the Geneva conventions too). That it does exist, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that it is important remains common ground to all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads of state of member nations of the UN, but perhaps,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially to the heads of permanent security council
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members. Presidents Bush and Chirac do NOT dispute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the existence of international law, or that their countries are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; signatures to the UN Charter. Rather they DO dispute what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the law is. And that dispute is crucial both to the nature of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war and to the prospects of making any international peace.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize that international law is probably outside the comfort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; zones and normal areas of immediate interest for many people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including some of the bright capable people who frequent this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list. But right now is not a good time for smart folks to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allowing international law to become a new form of scripture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and to assume that it can only be interpreted to commonfolk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by priesthoods of various political persuasions. It has been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said that democracies get the governments that they deserve.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And Sagan has written a book that is part of the recommended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading list called the Demon Haunted World. I would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourage all extropes to look beyond the temptation to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely stick with the easy emotional biases that come to all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us and to 'take a good look through the telescope' rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just guess at the truth. If extropic goals are to be realised in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our lifetimes we cannot afford to be too introspective with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respect to the affairs and politics of the world. Now is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time, international law is not an issue, in which it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sensible for people with extropic aspirations to take the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view that they can afford to be tourists, passengers, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncritical believers. If we do, we become part of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem, part of the inertia against change that we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to work against. We cede more power to politicians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and demand of them less accountability each time we fail to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage. Death and conservatism are the defaults. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I commend to those extropes who wish to engage with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the substantial challenges of our times with their own minds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly the following legal opinions for their own personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consideration. They are not an easy read necessarily but if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you accept as I do that the rule of law and the honouring of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreements is not irrelevant to extropic aspirations them I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; urge you to recognize that they are an important read.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here is a link (one page only and a repost) to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australian and UK Attorney General's argument in support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the view that the war would be lawful.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://open.gov.uk/NewsRoom/NRArticle/0,1169,223412~801b22~fs~en,00.html">http://open.gov.uk/NewsRoom/NRArticle/0,1169,223412~801b22~fs~en,00.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now here is a link to one of two opinions provided to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Australian Federal Opposition Leader Simon Crean 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguing, after having had the opportunity to consider the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above, that the war is illegal.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other supporting opinion, provided to the Opposition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leader, and which I have sourced from its author, I can also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make available to any one that is interested.
