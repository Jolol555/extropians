<p>No, not untrue at all. FOX probably promotes itself as unbiased at least
<br>
once an hour. Have you ever spent a couple of days watching the channel? 
<br>
<p>I'm not saying that FOX makes a secret of its intentionally right-winged
<br>
biased editorials, but in general the network offers almost nothing from the
<br>
&quot;other side.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Colmes (Hannity's supposed liberal nemesis on FOX) is an unphotogenic,
<br>
uncharismatic wimp who can barely articulate a clear sentence. He's there
<br>
just to serve as a placeholder and a punching bag. Colmes is FOX's &quot;token
<br>
liberal.&quot; 
<br>
<p>CNN on the other hand offers some serious liberal opponents to debate
<br>
reasonable conservative guys like Tucker Carlson. I happen to really like
<br>
Tucker Carlson. And I also enjoy watching Carlson debate serious liberals
<br>
who know how to present an argument on &quot;Crossfire&quot;. Such quality events
<br>
never happen on FOX.
<br>
<p>Regarding Neil Cavuto's scathing ad hominem attack on the professor at FOX:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll note here that you don't seem to be quoting anything the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professor said in his letter to Cavuto. Such is evidence of bias.
</em><br>
<p>Excuse me, Mike, but neither did Cavuto. I don't have any such information
<br>
about the professor's supposed letter. Cavuto told his audience only that
<br>
the professor had called or written to complain that Cavuto wears his
<br>
conservative bias on his sleeve. Cavuto then called the professor every name
<br>
in the book in a childish attack that would have earned a fifth grader
<br>
after-school detention. The professor was not even on the air at the time to
<br>
defend himself.
<br>
<p>The best thing I can say about that incident is that Cavuto did not tell us
<br>
the professor's real name on television. But I'm sure that was only to avoid
<br>
a lawsuit.
