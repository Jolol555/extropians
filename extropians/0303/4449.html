<p>Well, I'll freely admit I'm proposing thinly-disguised deliberatly 
<br>
provocative acts since Mr Bokov called for a discussion of tactics of 
<br>
leaderless resistance.
<br>
<p>I had perhaps a similar idea I posted a while back about copyrighted 
<br>
books finding themselves distributed on the internet as a result of a 
<br>
multitude of reviewers each employing fair use by quoting a paragraph or 
<br>
two in an online review, followed by nefarious hackers making lists of 
<br>
links to the reviews in paragraph order.
<br>
<p>Given that such reviews might be marginal contributions to criticism ('I 
<br>
loved this book. The first paragraph set the tone. Here it is:') I 
<br>
suppose one could make a case that the individual reviewers were 
<br>
knowingly participating in some sort of conspiracy, even though they had 
<br>
no contact with each other (having perhaps only RSS syndication of their 
<br>
reviews as a common element). They'd probably be easier to track down 
<br>
than the nefarious link lister.
<br>
<p>I wonder if this parallels the sixties development of hallucinogens 
<br>
where new chemicals were concocted after the last week's drug had been 
<br>
declared a controlled substance. As I recall some law was passed to end 
<br>
this trickery (though I understand we're all guilty of this, having some 
<br>
of these proscribed chemicals in our brains at all times). Would one 
<br>
have to outlaw all innovative ways to configure network-coordinated 
<br>
groups to prevent such configurations from being used for illegal purposes?
