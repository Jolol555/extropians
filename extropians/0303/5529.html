<em>&gt; Pawlenty wants protesters to pay law enforcement costs

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ST. PAUL - As anti-war protesters begin adopting more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confrontational tactics, Gov. Tim Pawlenty wants them to reimburse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law enforcement for the expense of their own arrests. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We're not saying people don't have a right to free speech,&quot; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governor said. &quot;We're just saying people don't have a right to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free arrest.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>ROTFLMAO. He is right of course. Even in cases where charges are
<br>
mitigated by circumstances, court costs can be levied. Considering that
<br>
the protest movement makes getting arrested an integral part of their
<br>
political action, they are externalizing the costs of their theater
<br>
onto the public by doing so. This is forcing the taxpayer to pay for
<br>
political expression they may not agree with. 
<br>
<p>But back to the subject of this thread. Current polls show that 85% of
<br>
Americans feel the war is going well, and 78% support the war. 53%
<br>
accept the necessity of civilian casualties with 12% additional saying
<br>
so only if it saves US soldier's lives (i.e. dealing with human
<br>
shields) for a total 65% support even with significant civilian
<br>
casualties. These figures presented by Democratic pollster Dick Morris
<br>
(Clinton's top pollster/political consultant). Morris says Dems need to
<br>
get over it and get behind the war or they will remain behind next year
<br>
when it counts. Anti-war candidates may be getting news right now, but
<br>
come next fall, people will remember the likes of Howard Dean like they
<br>
now remember the names of GOP presidential candidates from the 1944
<br>
election.
<br>
<p>For once, I agree entirely with a Democrat... Of course, if I were a
<br>
cynical libertarian, I'd want to see as weak a DNC candidate as
<br>
possible, to encourage more people to vote libertarian as a protest
<br>
vote against a GOP landslide.
