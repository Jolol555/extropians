<p>
Patents are analogous to homesteading.  Under that regime, a settler
<br>
could acquire ownership of some land by occupying and improving it.
<br>
Patents apply similar rules to intellectual space.
<br>
<p>One of the problems with homesteading in the United States was an instance
<br>
of what is called rent-seeking.  Settlers would occupy land prematurely,
<br>
before it was economically ripe to do so.  They would live on the land
<br>
at a loss for a number of years in the expectation that as civilization
<br>
developed in the area, the land would eventually become valuable.
<br>
But all those years of losses were wasted economic effort that could
<br>
have been put to better use.  In fact the waste can be so great as to
<br>
dissipate all the future value of the land.
<br>
<p>Patents might see some of the same problem - people rush to get patents
<br>
even when they don't make that much economic sense.  The limited term
<br>
of patents will help to avoid waste, but some still does occur.
<br>
<p>I think another of the big problems with patents is that most are not well
<br>
managed.  The transaction costs to negotiate a license are extremely high.
<br>
How many here who have faced a problem due to a patent have seriously
<br>
considered trying to negotiate a license?  Each such failure is a lost
<br>
opportunity for the patent holder.
<br>
<p>I foresee a day when every patent will have a link you can click on to
<br>
license it.  As the internet works to drive down transaction costs in
<br>
all other areas, it will facilitate patent licensing as well.  This might
<br>
even be a huge economic opportunity for the first company to facilitate
<br>
this process.  Maybe they can even get a business patent on the idea...
<br>
<p>Once patents are no longer a brick wall, but rather a limited tax,
<br>
they will be much less of a problem and opposition to them will decrease.
<br>
