<em>&gt; From: &quot;Michael S. Lorrey&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Re:POLITICS/CURRENT%20EVENTS:%20Non-Solution%20Unsatsfactory,%20Fwd:%20More%20on%20Lee">mlorrey@yahoo.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X-Mailer: YaBB
</em><br>
<p>I response to the quotes from Andrew Sullivan Mike argues
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The difficulty is in continuing to cherish principles that should be held
</em><br>
when
<br>
<em>&gt; treating with others of similar principles, but not when dealing with
</em><br>
those
<br>
<em>&gt; who do not hold them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Still, if the strategy of the enemy is that of leaderless insurgency, of
</em><br>
use
<br>
<em>&gt; of tactics which are proscribed by the Geneva Conventions as that of
</em><br>
illlegal
<br>
<em>&gt; combatants, what are we to gain by continuing to adhere to precepts which
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; world either does not understand (in the case of the Western Left) or
</em><br>
despises
<br>
<em>&gt; (in the case of the Islamist radicals and other tyrannicals)?
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p>This is
<br>
<em>&gt; far better than even the Geneva Conventions demand. Under those
</em><br>
Conventions,
<br>
<em>&gt; it is entirely within our rights to summarily execute anyone found to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an illegal combatant, even without a military tribunal. This IS what our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-existing western principles demand and allow us to do, no matter what
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; hew and cry is from leftist groups.
</em><br>
<p>This is true - it has been a principle of the laws of war for a long time
<br>
(well before any Geneva Convention) that combatants not in uniform or
<br>
readily identifiable in some agreed way have no rights and can be killed out
<br>
of hand. The question (apart from whether you would want to sink to that
<br>
level, which Mike deals with in the bit I've snipped) is prudential. What is
<br>
the best way of responding to this kind of warfare? This problem has arisen
<br>
several times in the last hundred years, for the British in the Boer War,
<br>
both sides in the Russian Civil War, the British in Ireland, Palestine,
<br>
Cyprus, Malaya (that list goes on and on), America in Vietnam, France in
<br>
Algeria, Germans in WW II, Russians in Afghanistan, Chechnya. Many other
<br>
cases.  The problem is that no power has produced a military doctrine for
<br>
dealing with partisan warfare that is effective (in the sense of achieving
<br>
military or political objectives at an acceptable cost). That is why people
<br>
keep on resorting to this tactic. The other side of the case is the tendency
<br>
of states since the 1860s to wage war against entire societies (total war).
<br>
<p>&lt;snip detailed argument on thecase for pre-emptive strikes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is pre-emption objectively in conflict with our western principles?
</em><br>
Possibly,
<br>
<em>&gt; but are we even pre-empting anything? &gt;
</em><br>
<p>I think this is entirely beside the point. History is full of examples of
<br>
pre-emptive action by states to remove potential threats. For example,
<br>
Nelson sailed into Copenhagen and sank the Danish fleet (Britain not being
<br>
in a state of war with Denmark) to stop it getting in to the hands of the
<br>
French. During WWII the British again attacked and sank the (Vichy) French
<br>
fleet, again without being in a state of war with France. The whole idea of
<br>
sovereign states is that they retain an ultimate right of self-defence which
<br>
ony they can judge. In that sense international relations are a Hobbesian
<br>
state of nature, inasmuch as 'international law' only consists of treaties
<br>
that the contracting parties (states) have voluntarily agreed to abide by.
<br>
All of this legalistic talk about whether state actions are lawfull is so
<br>
much hot air and obscures the real questions leaders need to consider which
<br>
are those of prudence and rationally assessed self-interest. Get out those
<br>
copies of Sun-Tsu and Old Nick! If I thought current US policy was the
<br>
product of a Machiavellian calculation (as France's is) I'd be less worried.
<br>
What I fear is that there's a bit too much idealism.
<br>
