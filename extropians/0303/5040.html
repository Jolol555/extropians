<br>
<p>----- &gt; Much has been trumpeted on this list by people like Samantha,
<br>
Hubert,
<br>
<em>&gt; Amara, Naddy, and others that they consider the US to be the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat. Who is it that is breaking the rules here? Not the US. Who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it that is violating human rights willy-nilly? Not the US.
</em><br>
<p>I want to see the likes of you, Mike Lorrey, if an invasion troop destroys
<br>
the water pipes in your home town, kills your family, makes your computers
<br>
useless. Would you still have the manual with the Geneva convention in your
<br>
pocket when you pick up your gun? Would you still put on a US army suit to
<br>
fight against those bastards you have not invited to free your country? I
<br>
would not. I would be fighting with all the dirty tricks my instincts of
<br>
survival would trigger. By the way, if anybody still wants an &quot;Old&quot; European
<br>
Liberation Army to come over and liberate your people from the BUsh junta, I
<br>
guess chances are good now. A few month ago I was the only one I knew who
<br>
propagated this proposal, but meanwhile, where 50.000 schoolboys and
<br>
schoolgirls gathered in Berlin on the first day of war, I heard similar
<br>
statements. Makes me think the young generation in Germany is on the right
<br>
path.
<br>
<p>The US is the aggressor. They are PRODUCING all the situations we witness
<br>
right now - or better the small part of images and news that pass
<br>
censorship.The axis of evil, Bush-Blair-Aznar, and all those who are in the
<br>
position to give orders must be condemned in Den Haague to life
<br>
imprisonment. Of course the same is true for Saddam and his own war criminal
<br>
junta.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our forces are struggling not just to free people who want to be freed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our forces are working hard to get them aid so they can eat and drink
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow,
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, after they first have destroyed water pipes and electricity supply
<br>
they drive through town with small rations of water and food and generously
<br>
distribute it to the suffering people and probably even believe they are
<br>
good hearted. Your fine generals and soldiers have caused the beginning of a
<br>
huge humanitarian desaster. No elecricity, no water in Basra.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; while Khofi Annan has abdicated UN responsibility for any aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to people in Iraq,
</em><br>
<p>First you make fun at the UN and now you lament. Of course the UN helps but
<br>
the responsibilty is with your insane god sent leaders. Many private and
<br>
public aid organisations are trying to alleviate the misery that your abused
<br>
and betrayed soldiers have caused. The biggest private German medicine
<br>
organsiation is on the way. I feel pity for these very young POWs shown on
<br>
TV. Poor kids, probably thought they were invincible because they belong to
<br>
God's own country. Bullshit. Now your President is proud of them and prays
<br>
for them. Good to know. But I cannot see what should be wrong with showing
<br>
these videos. Everybody with a fairly decent IQ should have had enough power
<br>
of imagination to picture what would happen BEFORE the war started.
