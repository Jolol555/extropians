<p><em>&gt; The basic problem isn't that the allocation is unfair, but that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political pressures can introduce more stuff as &quot;public goods&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are puppet theaters public goods taxpayers should fund? At 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least in Sweden they are :-) So this means the government can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introduce a nearly arbitrary number of new goods to vote about. 
</em><br>
<p>Bret Kulakovich made a similar point:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyhow, you've begged the question: No one wants to spend for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defence, so little is spent on defense. The next war comes around and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - oh wait, there isn't a war - the first exobrate that showed up with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sharpened pencil took over the country.
</em><br>
<p>Theoretically, the point of the mechanism is to find out how much people
<br>
truly value these various public goods.  There is no particular problem
<br>
with new goods being created, as long as it doesn't make the mechanics
<br>
of the procedure become too unwieldy (and it's not clear whether the
<br>
whole thing would really be manageable today even with a modest set of
<br>
publi goods).  If people like puppet theaters, they will be funded,
<br>
and likewise for national defense.  The goal of the mechanism is to
<br>
solve the free rider problem so that the funding levels of these goods
<br>
accurately reflects the public sentiment.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; but now we get the opposite effect: it is hard to raise the allocation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the level people might want, even if we all want it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the details of the mechanism are not too clear to me either.
<br>
The one paper I saw which described an experiment had only five subjects,
<br>
but they got pretty rapid convergence to an optimal value.  They used
<br>
iterated periods rather than the continuous mechanism I described, but
<br>
they got there within a few iterations.
<br>
<p>It would be very interesting to try something on a larger scale, maybe
<br>
using the net.  We could think of some public good, like paying some
<br>
person to post more or less, then run the GL mechanism and see what the
<br>
community consensus was.  The hard part is probably getting people to
<br>
pay up at the end.
