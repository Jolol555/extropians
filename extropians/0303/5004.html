<p><em>&gt; &gt; The point at which the largest companies become a governement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at which they use force and violent coercion to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; competitors and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maintain a monopoly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.exratio.com/">http://www.exratio.com/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, yes, and I took your point that you have to accept an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is, that the temptation for a monopoly (PPF /
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurance provider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; / what have you) is going to be very, very large. Who, after all, can stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them? No one at all, by definition almost. Is there any other action, once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are of that size, that would continue to increase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shareholder profits?
</em><br>
<p>This is actually a very interesting question: how do you check power except
<br>
by use of greater power? Of course, invoking a greater power in the same
<br>
mould defeats the object -- we end up back in the tyranny of slavery.
<br>
<p>The best I can come up with is the following:
<br>
<p>a) assume that any significant alliance of providers can overcome the
<br>
largest provider (militarily or force them out of business)
<br>
b) providers are in anything goes free market competition (of course,
<br>
&quot;anything goes&quot; means anything that doesn't alienate your customer base)
<br>
c) multiple providers compete in all geographical regions
<br>
d) forms of coercion and theft are about the only things that are against
<br>
the law; corporate entities do not shield people from direct accountability
<br>
for their actions
<br>
e) assume a rich layer of service provider brands and specialist
<br>
subcontractors: subcontractors are not going to accept exclusive business
<br>
relationships, nor are they going to stay in relationships that destroy
<br>
their other business
<br>
f) assume a healthy investigative press and people thinking much the way
<br>
that people do now about businesses
<br>
<p>Under these circumstances, any provider that starts acting like a government
<br>
is going to lose customers, business partners and public support pretty
<br>
quickly. All the competitors will be sticking the knife in just as fast as
<br>
they can to increase their revenue.
<br>
<p>Now if people within a provider -- include C-levels -- coerce or steal, then
<br>
they will be open to whatever legal system is in place (say a distributed
<br>
system of dispute resolution run by these same competing providers).
<br>
<p>So in short, business checks and balances: the tyranny of the customer, the
<br>
constant vigilance of competitors, competition, wide and easy access to
<br>
information.
