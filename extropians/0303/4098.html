<em>&gt; &gt; The US is aggressively devaluing the dollar by issuing more to pay

<em>&gt; I think I follow the model. So what are the effects of zillions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars in bogus loan guarantees, IMF writeoffs and the
</em><br>
money-creation of the credit card divisions of major commercial banks
<br>
in the world? Not asking about the relative scale--I'm asking about the
<br>
effects.
<br>
<p>The old idea of printing more paper money being inflationary is bogus.
<br>
Keeping the M1 and M2 stats stable is what money supply is all about,
<br>
and when you have billions of dollars more going toward oil, an import,
<br>
and thus money flowing out of the country, you need to keep the
<br>
domestic money supply stable or risk a deflationary depression (i.e.
<br>
money scarcity). When gas prices return to normal, other means will be
<br>
used to rake that excess money back into the reserve system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS: I'm still trying to figure out exactly why Moore's Law (and other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; singularity-like stuff) isn't (commonly thought to be) deflationary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (yet).

<em>&gt; I think it has something to do with the time value of technotoys and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their going out of fashion/obsolescence--an 8-track TASCAM
</em><br>
Portastudio I paid kilobucks for, new, is now basically landfill in the
<br>
eyes of eBay... etc.,  etc.
<br>
<em>&gt; It reminds me a little of the idea of issuing money with a &quot;freshness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; date&quot; on it. The toys aren't staple commodities, so their market
</em><br>
value has a  first-quadrant-1/x-like curve in many cases. Comment?
<br>
<p>If you recall the 'planned obsolescence' outrages of the 1970s, where
<br>
the big three manufactured essentially throwaway cars under the theory
<br>
that the potential auto market was essentially saturated (every family
<br>
had one) and that the makers needed to get these people to come back
<br>
and buy another car before their old one wore out. They built them,
<br>
therefore, to wear out faster. They didn't expect that the people would
<br>
buy more cars per family than one, or even two at best. Today,
<br>
generally every licensed member of the family has a car of their own in
<br>
most communities, at least all teens in a family have at least one car
<br>
of their own to use.
<br>
<p>Moore's Law is planned obsolescence embedded into the structure of
<br>
technological progress. THe old technotoy doesn't wear out, it just is
<br>
superseded by better toys for the same price. New toys are made much
<br>
smaller with the same performance of the old bigger technology.
<br>
<p>My Handspring Visor Pro has the same processing power of my first
<br>
Windows equipped desktop PC and many times the performance of my first
<br>
PC. I wonder if I can run Dos on it with a mini hard drive in the
<br>
springboard slot? ;) 
<br>
<p>The desktop computers I still run, which cost me just under $1000 new,
<br>
are worth about $100 and are worth more to me as tools than their
<br>
resale value, though they are taking up space which I could probably
<br>
use better.
