<p>
Pulitzer-winning Newsday reporter Laurie Garrett went to the World
<br>
Economic Summit in Davos, Switzerland this year and hung out with heads of
<br>
major world corporations and famous heads of state. Some blunt personal
<br>
commentary was sent to friends in a 2,000-word e-mail that ended up online
<br>
and is very worth reading.
<br>
&nbsp;A few thoroughly eye-opening excerpts follow, but just so you know, the
<br>
whole story of who she is and how the private e-mail became public is
<br>
here:
<br>

<p>And the full text of the e-mail is here:
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.topica.com/lists/psychohistory/read/message.html?mid=1711891071&amp;sort=d&amp;start=4389">http://www.topica.com/lists/psychohistory/read/message.html?mid=1711891071&amp;sort=d&amp;start=4389</a><br>
<p>Now, prepare to be astonished:
<br>
<p>====
<br>
Overall, here is what I learned about the state of our world:
<br>
<p>- I was in a dinner with heads of Saudi and German FBI, plus the foreign
<br>
minister of Afghanistan. They all said that at its peak Al Qaeda had
<br>
70,000 members. Only 10% of them were trained in terrorism -- the rest
<br>
were military recruits. Of that 7000, they say all but about 200 are dead
<br>
or in jail.
<br>
<p>- But Al Qaeda, they say, is like a brand which has been heavily
<br>
franchised. And nobody knows how many unofficial franchises have been
<br>
spawned since 9/11.
<br>
<p>- The global economy is in very very very very bad shape. Last year when
<br>
WEF met here in New York all I heard was, &quot;Yeah, it's bad, but recovery is
<br>
right around the corner&quot;. This year &quot;recovery&quot; was a word never uttered.
<br>
Fear was palpable -- fear of enormous fiscal hysteria. The watchwords were
<br>
&quot;deflation&quot;, &quot;long term stagnation&quot; and &quot;collapse of the dollar&quot;. All of
<br>
this is without war.
<br>
<p>- If the U.S. unilaterally goes to war, and it is anything short of a
<br>
quick surgical strike (lasting less than 30 days), the economists were all
<br>
predicting extreme economic gloom: falling dollar value, rising spot
<br>
market oil prices, the Fed pushing interest rates down towards zero with
<br>
resulting increase in national debt, severe trouble in all countries whose
<br>
currency is guaranteed agains the dollar (which is just about everybody
<br>
except the EU), a near cessation of all development and humanitarian
<br>
programs for poor countries. Very few economists or ministers of finance
<br>
predicted the world getting out of that economic funk for minimally
<br>
five-10 years, once the downward spiral ensues.
<br>
<p>- Not surprisingly, the business community was in no mood to hear about a
<br>
war in Iraq. Except for diehard American Republicans, a few Brit Tories
<br>
and some Middle East folks the WEF was in a foul, angry anti-American
<br>
mood. Last year the WEF was a lovefest for America. This year the mood was
<br>
so ugly that it reminded me of what it felt like to be an American
<br>
overseas in the Reagan years. The rich -- whether they are French or
<br>
Chinese or just about anybody -- are livid about the Iraq crisis primarily
<br>
because they believe it will sink their financial fortunes.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>- US unilateralism is seen as arrogant, bullyish. If the U.S. cannot
<br>
behave in partnership with its allies -- especially the Europeans -- it
<br>
risks not only political alliance but BUSINESS, as well. Company leaders
<br>
argued that they would rather not have to deal with US government
<br>
attitudes about all sorts of multilateral treaties (climate change,
<br>
intellectual property, rights of children, etc.) -- it's easier to just do
<br>
business in countries whose governments agree with yours. And it's
<br>
cheaper, in the long run, because the regulatory envornments match. War
<br>
against Iraq is seen as just another example of the unilateralism.
<br>
<p>- For a minority of the participants there was another layer of
<br>
AntiAmericanism that focused on moralisms and religion. I often heard
<br>
delegates complain that the US &quot;opposes the rights of children&quot;, because
<br>
we block all treaties and UN efforts that would support sex education and
<br>
condom access for children and teens. They spoke of sex education as a
<br>
&quot;right&quot;. Similarly, there was a decidedly mixed feeling about Ashcroft,
<br>
who addressed the conference. I attended a small lunch with Ashcroft, and
<br>
observed Ralph Reed and other prominent Christian fundamentalists working
<br>
the room and bowing their heads before eating. The rest of the world's
<br>
elite finds this American Christian behavior at least as uncomfortable as
<br>
it does Moslem or Hindu fundamentalist behavior. They find it awkward
<br>
every time a US representative refers to &quot;faith-based&quot; programs. It's
<br>
different from how it makes non-Christian Americans feel -- these folks
<br>
experience it as downright embarrassing.
<br>
<p>- When Colin Powell gave the speech of his life, trying to win over the
<br>
nonAmerican delegates, the sharpest attack on his comments came not from
<br>
Amnesty International or some Islamic representative -- it came from the
<br>
head of the largest bank in the Netherlands!
<br>
<p>I learned that the only economy about which there is much enthusiasm is
<br>
China, which was responsible for 77% of the global GDP growth in 2002. But
<br>
the honcho of the Bank of China, Zhu Min, said that fantastic growth could
<br>
slow to a crawl if China cannot solve its rural/urban problem. Currently
<br>
400 million Chinese are urbanites, and their average income is 16 times
<br>
that of the 900 million rural residents. Zhu argued China must urbanize
<br>
nearly a billion people in ten years!
<br>
<p>I learned that the US economy is the primary drag on the global economy,
<br>
and only a handful of nations have sufficient internal growth to thrive
<br>
when the US is stagnating.
