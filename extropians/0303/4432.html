<p>OK I had another related idea on this.  A remote transmitting
<br>
camera will have enherent bandwidth limitations as well as
<br>
high appetite for power.  Recognizing the state of the art
<br>
for cheap wireless videocameras(~80 bucks, max range about
<br>
30 meters, picture quality so-so) we could use them as follows:
<br>
<p>Assume a bunch of extropians wanted to attend an anti-cryonics
<br>
rally as counterprotesters, for instance.  Each puts her first
<br>
name on the transmitter and last name on the receiver.  We
<br>
meet at a prearranged location, everybody trades receivers,
<br>
then attaches that receiver to your backpack portable VCR, and
<br>
your transmitter to a hat or clothing.  You pay special
<br>
attention to the name on the receiver that you end up with,
<br>
because it is your responsibility to stay within range of
<br>
that transmitter, but not too close.  Then Jones watches
<br>
Yudkowsky who watches Atkins who watches Crocker who watches
<br>
Corbin who watches Jones.  If your transmitter gets arrested,
<br>
then you must withdraw to protect the evidence.  With a few
<br>
dozen of us, we could be spread out all over a big crowd,
<br>
acting as a big smeared out extro-amoeba, with inherent
<br>
redundancy, low cost.
<br>
<p>We could even make a poor-mans time stamp tool.  We carry
<br>
along handheld AM radios which are recorded in the background
<br>
with a small AM transmitter calling out the time every 10
<br>
seconds.  I was part of an astronomy group that used this
<br>
time stamper, not for a protest march, but for timing star
<br>
transits of the moon during a grazing occultation.
<br>
<p>If even one group were to make full use of this scheme, it
<br>
would put the civil back into civil protest.
