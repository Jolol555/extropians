<em>&gt; Bush's response to the UN argument is that he believes Iraq 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an imminent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat to the USA, and that we are a sovereign country, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility to protect the American people. I agree 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wholeheartedly that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are a sovereign country and that we don't need permission 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the UN to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wage war, but the argument that Iraq is a serious threat to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the USA is total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullshit. We bombed the hell out of Iraq 12 years ago, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time since then we've restrained Saddam with weapons inspections and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic sanctions. As far as his conventional forces and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weapons go, Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can barely fight his way out of a paper bag. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Uncle Jimbo:  Boys, lookee there. That there's a rocky moutain black bear,
<br>
one of the few remaining of its kind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn't it beautiful. By God, it coming right for us!	
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Shoots the Black Bear&gt;
<br>
Stan:         Hey, it wasn't coming right for us. It was just sitting there.
<br>
<p>Uncle Jimbo:  Shhh, not so loud. Now that there's just a technicality.	
<br>
Kyle:	        What do you mean?	
<br>
Uncle Jimbo:  You see boys, the democrats have passed a lot of laws trying
<br>
to stop us from hunting.	
<br>
Cartman:      Democrats piss me off!	
<br>
Uncle Jimbo:  They say we can't shoot certain animals anymore, unless
<br>
they're posing an immediate threat. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, before we shoot somethin', we have to say 'It's
<br>
coming right for us.'	
<br>
Stan:         Wow, you're smart Uncle Jimbo.	
<br>
Ned:          Mmm, Jimbo look, mm.	
<br>
Uncle Jimbo:  Ohho, it's a deer. Looks like about a .46 gauge Ned. - It's
<br>
coming right for us!!	
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;Shoots deer with rocket&gt;
<br>
Cartman:      Kickass!!	
<br>
Uncle Jimbo:  Did you see that?! I was imperiled by that ferocious, charging
<br>
buck.	
<br>
<p>etc.
