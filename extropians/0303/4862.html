The odd thing about all this is your meat-world
<br>
presence, Lee.  Extropians, those of you who have not met
<br>
Lee Corbin in the flesh, honestly, he is Mister Rogers.
<br>
Understatement: Mister Rogers is a hellraiser in comparison.
<br>
You would never guess all the edgy stuff could originate
<br>
from such a gentle person.  And Lee Daniel Crocker
<br>
is a big huggy teddy bear of a guy.  Im not kidding
<br>
here folks.  In the flesh world, Doug Skrecky talks
<br>
about other things besides fruit flies, Samantha
<br>
talks about other than politics, and I occasionally
<br>
get serious.

<p>When Steve Bridge, a former Alcor president, came to the Creekside Preserve, one of the things he brought up on his cryonet post about the experience what that to this great astonishment I was not an extremely loud and outgoing guy!! LOL  For some reason my penchant for exclamation marks and &quot;lol's&quot; had given him that impression.  He said about me &quot;I also enjoyed meeting John Grigg for the first time.  He is a lot calmer in person than in front of a keyboard!  (I am using John's trademark exclamation point here in friendly jest.  He really is a nice fellow.)&quot;
<br>
<p>I was touched by the compliment.  But as my employer says, &quot;being nice is not always such a great thing, instead be known as fair and someone not to mess with.&quot;  My manager 101 training continues.
<br>
<p>On an extropian note, I wonder with a mature bodymod technology how the people Spike mentioned might shape their outward appearances to suit their multifaceted personalities.  If they are one way in public and another on an email list, would the hidden statement of their new appearance fall somewhere between the two extremes?
<br>
<p>best wishes,
