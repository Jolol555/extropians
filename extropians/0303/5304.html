<p>
This episode of John Doe, which I watched, tonight airs on cable TV at 9 
<br>
every Friday included cryogenics and downloading human minds. It portrayed 
<br>
these technologies positively. In contrast, it portrayed the assistant who 
<br>
was very religious as a lunatic. It directly questioned Christianity and 
<br>
other dogmatic beliefs and promoted these technologies.
<br>
<p>Recently there has been great progress in mainstream media. Progress has 
<br>
also been made in children’s shows which innocently promote these ideas in 
<br>
shows like Johnny neutron, Dexter laboratory ect. I believe that there is a 
<br>
large percentage of people on the verge of disbelieving religion and 
<br>
accepting a more science based belief system. These &quot;verge&quot; people will keep 
<br>
increasing every year because of the media and because of the application of 
<br>
new discoveries. Although I do not see mainstream America accepting any 
<br>
complicated philosophical system such as pan critical rationalism for at 
<br>
least 50 years or more.
<br>
<p>This &quot;revolution&quot; could come in about 10 years. When discoveries in new 
<br>
technologies (nano ect..) are starting to become useful to the average 
<br>
person. I often wonder if the government is funding technology awareness in 
<br>
the general media. So that these new technologies are not rejected because 
<br>
of religious beliefs. This propaganda would ensure that this technology 
<br>
could be used and are superiority on the world stage could be maintained. If 
<br>
the government is not directly doing so now it will within the next 10 
<br>
years. Currently, the government must be giving money to other institutions 
<br>
and corporations which push that these ideas get into mainstream media. What 
<br>
year will the president get on TV and say &quot;everything is going to be ok&quot; 
<br>
when all these protestors around the world are against it?
<br>
<p>I wander if America will be divided as in Vietnam. With the young vs. the 
<br>
old. I can see it playing out like this. This type of rebellion could occur 
<br>
all across the world. With the majority of the old on the side of religion 
<br>
and the majority of the young on the side of science.
<br>
I am sure those business types are waiting for such a situation. Wow, what 
<br>
if both sides were funded the same. Imagine the endless propaganda. This 
<br>
could be the finally in which hopefully will enter a new age. How will this 
<br>
all play out? any other predictions?
