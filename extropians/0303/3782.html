<p>
Here's an idea inspired by Mother Theresa herself. Years ago I worked in 
<br>
a small company which had a small network control center staff by all 
<br>
guys. The calendar on the wall was some swimsuit type calendar which was 
<br>
deemed inappropriate by some of the female staff who worked elsewhere in 
<br>
the building but had occassion to stop by the NOC. So the guys got a 
<br>
Mother Theresa calendar which had many stories about her which I read.
<br>
<p>My favorite was the 'kissed by jesus' story. Apparently some dying guy 
<br>
was really sick (uh, he was dying) and cursed God for his misfortune. 
<br>
Mother Theresa (MT) explained that he should think of himself as being 
<br>
'kissed by Jesus'. This concept was a little difficult to take so the 
<br>
guy again cursed God, and again MT would tell him that he had been 
<br>
'kissed by Jesus'. Finally the guy said, 'Mother Theresa, I wish Jesus 
<br>
would stop kissing me!' whereupon the good Mother congratulated him with 
<br>
'Now you've got it!!!'
<br>
<p>Now, I know some of you right now are visualizing a returned Crusading 
<br>
Christ, charging thru a crowd kissing people left and right, with them 
<br>
developing oozing sores with Star-Trek-like speed and mortally 
<br>
collasping in leprous pain, pus-filled pustules bursting left and right. 
<br>
I sure did. It took me a while to appreciate the genius of MT's position.
<br>
<p>So what I'm proposing is a large fleet (as in millions) of cruise 
<br>
missiles, JDAM's, and other precision weapons which would be held 
<br>
permanently aloft on the gossamer wings of robotic solar-powered 
<br>
aircraft, ready to be released at a moment's notice whenever and 
<br>
wherever a U.S. interest was at stake or a surplus of wealth required 
<br>
opening new markets and investment opportunities. Reflective material 
<br>
would be incorporated into the wings such that they would glitter and be 
<br>
viewable from earth in the daytime. The affect would be like a starry 
<br>
night except that it'd be daytime and they would be moving. Children 
<br>
would be taught that these were 'guardian angels'. And people like 
<br>
Saddam Hussein could be 'touched by an angel'. Oh what a wonderful world 
<br>
that would be.
<br>
