<p>Well, the *first* part of that is right...  but take, for example, the 
<br>
step in your reasoning where you say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since 25% of the eggs are blue with pearls, and 40% are blue,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then 5/8 of the blue eggs have pearls
</em><br>
<p>Bayes' Theorem is sometimes written:
<br>
p(A|X) = p(A&amp;X) / p(X)
<br>
<p>(which is of course what
<br>
<p>p(A|X) = p(X|A)*p(A) / [p(X|A)*p(A) + p(X|~A)*p(~A)]
<br>
<p>simplifies to)
<br>
<p>In the way Bayesian problems are usually presented, you take the prior 
<br>
probability p(pearl) and the two conditional probabilities p(blue|pearl) 
<br>
and p(blue|~pearl), three numbers with three degrees of freedom, to arrive 
<br>
at p(pearl|blue).  But actually if you have *any* three probabilities from 
<br>
the set of 16 probabilities p(pearl), p(~blue), p(~blue&amp;pearl), 
<br>
p(~blue|~pearl), p(pearl|~blue), et cetera, and the three probabilities 
<br>
have three degrees of freedom among them (you can't derive the third 
<br>
quantity from the first two), then it suffices to derive the whole set. 
<br>
The story problem is just a dramatic illustration of this.
<br>
<p>A verbal solution:
<br>
<p>Suppose you have a large barrel containing a number of plastic eggs.  Some 
<br>
eggs contain pearls, the rest contain nothing.  Some eggs are painted 
<br>
blue, the rest are painted red. Suppose that 40% of the eggs are painted 
<br>
blue, 5/13 of the eggs containing pearls are painted blue, and 20% of the 
<br>
eggs are both empty and painted red.  What is the probability that an egg 
<br>
painted blue contains a pearl?
<br>
<p>If 40% of the eggs are painted blue, 60% are painted red.
<br>
If 60% of the eggs are red, and 20% of the eggs are red and empty, then 
<br>
40% of the eggs are red and contain pearls.
<br>
If 5/13 of the eggs containing pearls are painted blue, 8/13 of the eggs 
<br>
containing pearls are painted red.
<br>
If 40% of the eggs are red and contain pearls, and 8/13 of the eggs 
<br>
containing pearls are painted red, then 65% of the eggs contain pearls.
<br>
If 65% of the eggs contain pearls, and 5/13 of the eggs containing pearls 
<br>
are painted blue, then 25% of the eggs are blue and contain pearls.
<br>
If 40% of the eggs are painted blue, and 25% of the eggs are blue and 
<br>
contain pearls, then 5/8 of the blue eggs contain pearls.
