<p>&lt;&lt;Counter-terrorist spray - The Physics Congress 2003
<br>
<p>Monday 17 March 2003
<br>
<p>New electrostatic spray apparatus which could save lives after a terrorist 
<br>
attack involving chemical or biological weapons will be revealed by Professor 
<br>
Edward Law of the University of Georgia, USA, to this year's Institute of 
<br>
Physics Congress at Heriot-Watt University on Thursday 27 March. The 
<br>
apparatus can quickly and effectively decontaminate the skin without 
<br>
producing lots of contaminated waste.
<br>
<p>The equipment is based on an electrostatic system that sprays a fine, 
<br>
atomised mist carrying decontaminating compounds, such as an antitoxins, 
<br>
disinfectants, or sanitizers, on to bare skin. The mist penetrates every 
<br>
crevice, the tiny droplets have what Professor Law described as &quot;adequate 
<br>
residual aerodynamic energy to convey and penetrate the electrified droplets 
<br>
into Faraday-shielded regions.&quot; In other words, the droplets get on to the 
<br>
skin of the armpit and groin areas.
<br>
<p>Electrostatic spraying has been used in industry to ensure an even and 
<br>
complete coating of paint and coloured powders on manufactured goods, such as 
<br>
cars, and in agriculture to make sure pest-control chemicals cover a crop. 
<br>
Professor Law and his colleagues have previously developed improved 
<br>
electrostatic spraying systems for industry and agriculture. In the current 
<br>
international political climate, Law was motivated by the need to make a 
<br>
contribution toward protecting people, both civilians and the armed forces, 
<br>
exposed to biological and chemical weapons.
<br>
<p>The apparatus takes the form of a walk-through booth with several 
<br>
microprocessor controlled nozzles. The nozzles are electrically wired so that 
<br>
the droplets of decontaminant solution spraying out are electrostatically 
<br>
charged and so stick to the skin of anyone standing in their path. Professor 
<br>
Law said 90 people an hour can be sprayed head to foot with 100 millilitres 
<br>
each of decontaminating spray. Only about 20 millilitres per spraying is 
<br>
wasted.
<br>
<p>Tests on mannequin and human subjects with innocuous bacteria put on their 
<br>
skin has demonstrated how effective the portable apparatus is in covering the 
<br>
person with antibacterial spray, said Professor Law. &quot;Our apparatus was about 
<br>
fifty times better at decontaminating the volunteers than other methods using 
<br>
uncharged spray,&quot; he explained.
<br>
<p>&quot;An important feature retained in our engineering design is mobility, the 
<br>
booth is not restricted to hospital use, and provides relatively high human 
<br>
'throughput' for protective treatment,&quot; he added. &quot;What remains to be 
<br>
evaluated is the control efficacy of decontaminant sprays which are specific 
<br>
to likely biological warfare agents.&quot;
