<p><em>&gt; What *I* want to see is an international poll to see what percentage of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people in the world think that if the international community fails to act 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firmly now against the UNITED STATES, then the world will become a more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous place in years to come?
</em><br>
<p>Act firmly?  You mean, like pass a lot of resolutions?
<br>
<p>Yes, why doesn't the rest of the world (not including the dozen
<br>
or two dozen European countries, not including Australia, not
<br>
including..., etc.)?   It would be a fine thing.  Perhaps that
<br>
&quot;rest of the world&quot; could pass oh, say, about two hundred 
<br>
resolutions.  For you, I even have a numbering scheme in mind:
<br>
<p>1442 - U.S. Out of Iraq
<br>
1443 - U.S. Out of Iraq
<br>
1444 - U.S. Out of Iraq
<br>
1445 - U.S. Out of Iraq
<br>
...
<br>
1641 - U.S. Out of Iraq
<br>
<p>I'm sure that you'll feel *so* much better.  After all, look
<br>
how much satisfaction you got out of all those U.N. resolutions
<br>
imploring Saddam Hussein to do this or that.  Yes, let's have
<br>
some more resolutions!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But then again, what does public opinion REALLY have to do with what's going 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on in the world today.... seems to me like the ones in power don't care to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listen to reason,
</em><br>
<p>You suppose that you and the people who agree with you have a
<br>
monopoly on reason?  You don't think that the nations of the
<br>
world with their think tanks and paid professionals standing
<br>
on decades of tradition and experience don't &quot;listen to reason&quot;?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; care for peace, or care to stop or lessen the REAL 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suffering in the world. $#^@% all this stuff about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'perceived threats', sheesh!
</em><br>
<p>Okay, who cared more for peace:  Neville Chamberlain or Winston
<br>
Churchill?  Listen, &quot;caring&quot; for peace on a superficial verbal
<br>
and emotional level is one thing; coldly calculating how to 
<br>
achieve it is another.
<br>
<p>I'm alive today because the leaders of the U.S.S.R. and the
<br>
leaders of the U.S.A. coldly calculated their way to real
<br>
peace.  Guess what would have happened if we in the West
<br>
had listened to all the peaceniks?  
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. The answer:  I'd be dead, Comrade Artillo.
