<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there a term for all false value systems that are sold to people?
</em><br>
<p>No generic term that I can think of.  The examples that come to
<br>
mind are religions and economic philosophies.  That's because
<br>
those are the only ones that I can think of that are &quot;sold&quot;:
<br>
they don't arise in all civilizations or societies.  Concrete
<br>
examples might be Judaism and Communism.  While Marxism was
<br>
&quot;sold&quot; to millions of people, it's nonetheless evident that
<br>
the time was ripe for those ideas, and that people were 
<br>
predisposed towards them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Such as (a) cultural value systems, (b) media value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems, (c) military value systems etc.
</em><br>
<p>It's not real clear what you mean.  Perhaps by way of examples,
<br>
(a) the degree to which lies are acceptable within a culture
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(to save face or something)
<br>
(b) how repressed or free the media is, is all I can think of
<br>
(c) staying in rank, supporting your comrades, obeying orders
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for military values?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; The word propaganda really only refers to media.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I use the term value system meaning a system designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bring about certain emotional responses to certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stimuli.  What is the correct terminology here?
</em><br>
<p>Again, I don't know of any generic term.  Examples that
<br>
come to mind are rousing patriotic speeches, automatic
<br>
respect for the flag, the King, or the Cross, mood music,
<br>
aged visages or sacred relics to elicit respect, political
<br>
symbols such as the Hammer and Sickle, or Swastika.  The
<br>
role of icons in modern Greek and Eastern Europe is
<br>
fascinating.  But I realize you're heading into *memes* here...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is interesting to note that the evolution of culture 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is no different than the evolution of any other meme.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is also interesting to note that as long as you fit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a greater memeplex such as democracy etc... the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details of a culture might as well be random from an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary standpoint.
</em><br>
<p>So it would seem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All these memes that control emotion control people.
</em><br>
<p>This is the contention of folks like Susan Blackmore
<br>
(who wrote the excellent Meme Machine).  Upon final
<br>
judgment my friends and I concluded that memetic 
<br>
analysis doesn't really provide additional information;
<br>
it's much like looking at the same information in a
<br>
different coordinate system, i.e., seeing the same
<br>
thing from a different perspective.
<br>
<p>Now it's still a very open question to me the degree
<br>
to which some memes such as
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;honesty is the best policy
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just say No!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;two wrongs don't make a right
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;character counts!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;X has a right to Y
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patriotism is the last refuge of a scoundrel
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War is not healthy for children, and other living things
<br>
<p>and so on, really affect behavior.  They do have an effect,
<br>
that much is certain.  I doubt that there is anyone reading
<br>
this who has not felt their persuading influence at one time
<br>
or another of one or more of these.  Speculating almost
<br>
irresponsibility via my own introspection, it seems that
<br>
if you are *already* inclined to some form of feeling or
<br>
in favor of some kind of action, then if one of these ready
<br>
memes suddenly comes to mind, it can solidify the response
<br>
you're having.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All these value systems have been sorted out to fit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mold of America.
</em><br>
<p>Okay---now you are getting very specific about the memeplexes
<br>
afflicting one particular nation.  Perhaps one could proceed
<br>
to analyze the memes that Americans have separately from
<br>
everyone else?  I really wouldn't know where to start there.
<br>
<p>Since the title of this thread relates all this to IRAQ, then
<br>
the current context suggests that one may wish to know what
<br>
memes drive the Americans to a 71% favorable view of invading
<br>
Iraq.  But clearly, many, many people around the world, 
<br>
especially in Australia, Poland, and Britain, are being driven
<br>
by these same memes.  (Once again I repeat the warning that
<br>
to speak of memes is IMO just another way to speak of the
<br>
same phenomena in more conventional language, just hoping that
<br>
meme-language jogs or inspires certain ideas more easily.)
<br>
<p>Clearly the Americans are affected still by 9-11, and feel (or
<br>
hope) that Bush's aggression towards Afghanistan and Iraq will
<br>
diminish the probabilities---in the long run, perhaps---of 
<br>
further incidents inimical to Western peace and prosperity.
<br>
So:  &quot;we have a right [sic] to protect ourselves&quot;, &quot;evil and
<br>
vicious dictators like Mussolini, Hitler, Tojo, etc., deserve
<br>
getting crushed&quot;, and &quot;right makes might&quot;  (a brand new one
<br>
recently created, we should google), might be some of the
<br>
ones driving things now.  Think of any others?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They [the value systems] haven't been chosen but naturally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selected.  In theory, we have been taught what is the positive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional response and what is a negative emotional response.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the verb &quot;have been taught&quot; conjures up images of
<br>
conspiracy, or control by certain people or groups.  Your
<br>
earlier remarks about natural growth and evolution are more
<br>
accurate IMO.
<br>
<p>Yes, but the learning is far from uniform.  A number of people,
<br>
especially from religious or rural backgrounds, appear to have
<br>
loyalties to &quot;the flag&quot; or &quot;our country&quot; in excess of those
<br>
from many minority groups, many university intellectuals, and
<br>
certain cosmopolitans.  After all, obviously 29% of the Americans
<br>
at this time find none of the above memes sufficiently driving,
<br>
nor do they embrace solidarity with the rest of the citizens
<br>
against a foreign country.
<br>
<p>So, as we discover that there is a gene for religiosity, may
<br>
we not eventually find that genes exist for patriotism?  Or
<br>
even genes for liberalism!?  I wouldn't be so surprised!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We have been taught to fit this mold of America.  It has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; become our Nature.
</em><br>
<p>Can't agree.  No one &quot;taught&quot; the Americans anything.  And
<br>
you cannot say it has become their Nature because dissent
<br>
is too widespread.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the very thought-provoking points and questions.
<br>
<p>Lee
