</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I also have sentience-loyalty rather than species-loyalty.  Look at my 
<br>
email address, for heaven's sake.  Unfortunately I turned out to be dead 
<br>
wrong in believing that any intelligence would be necessarily moral or 
<br>
even necessarily sentient.  Our intelligence and our morality *are* 
<br>
related, very deeply related; the people who think that morals and 
<br>
intelligence are separate magisteria are, as our intuitions insist, wrong. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that knowing this does not tell you what the relation 
<br>
between intelligence and morality actually *is*.  Okay, I finally know.  I 
<br>
haven't written it up yet, but I finally figured it out.  The relation 
<br>
between seed AI theory and Friendly AI theory turns out to be something 
<br>
like the relation between special and general relativity.  But while 
<br>
intelligence is an inextricable part of sentience it may be part of other 
<br>
things as well.  Marcus Hutter's AIXI-tl formalism specifies a computer 
<br>
program that is superhumanly effectual, unalterably hostile, and 
<br>
nonsentient.  It would take mastery of AI morality, on the same level as 
<br>
what it takes to create Friendly AI, to create a mind that was *not* 
<br>
completely worthless.
<br>
<p>The things that matter to us are a small, small target requiring exceeding 
<br>
precision to hit.  No more arbitrary, and no less valuable, but a small, 
<br>
small target.  There was a time when I thought otherwise.  But, if you 
<br>
recall, I never claimed, during that time, to know what the hell I was 
<br>
trying to hit.  Well, now I know and it's a small, small target.
