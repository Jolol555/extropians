<br>
<p>Steve,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hear two explanations for this phenomenon.  Perhaps they are both 
<br>
right or both wrong as they don't seem to be mutually exclusive.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first explanation is that when the Arabs armies were overrun by 
<br>
the invaders from the East during the middle ages the shock was so great that 
<br>
the entire Arab/Moslem society fractured.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second explanation is that they have again fractured because of 
<br>
the their continued defeats by the Israelis.  According to one explanation 
<br>
their turning to the fundamentalists was a result of this reaction.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However I have to point out the book The Lexus and the Olive Tree as 
<br>
well as Hernando de Soto's book The Mystery of Capital.  The Mystery of 
<br>
Capital points to the ill effects brought on in societies that do not have a 
<br>
system for protecting private property.  Dr. de Soto points the finger to at 
<br>
least one major (Egypt) middle eastern country that fails to protect private 
<br>
property.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also discussed installing a better form of government in Iraq.  My 
<br>
reading indicates that Bush, etal seems to regard it as very important to 
<br>
support a form of government that is chosen by the Iraqi themselves.  Exactly 
<br>
what this means when the rubber hits the road we will have to wait to see.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As long as I just commenting on things you have said let me comment on 
<br>
South America.  From time to time I am seeing comments that a fairly quiet 
<br>
religious conversion is going on in South America that is gradually 
<br>
overturning social structure.  I recently read an analysis in a major 
<br>
American Magazine but I don't intend to look it up for you -- even if the 
<br>
fellow was correct as to magnitude I wasn't impressed with his grasp of the 
<br>
religious movement. LOL  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically folks seem to agree that the American Christian 
<br>
Fundamentalists are sending husband-wife teams into South America to do 
<br>
missionary work.  Supposedly the South American women are extremely 
<br>
influenced by seeing the American Women as an equal member of the missionary 
<br>
team.  The SA women join the church and pull in their husbands.  In turn the 
<br>
missionaries preach a self reliance that is changing the ways of the SA 
<br>
underclass dramatically.  I believe that is a fair statement of what is 
<br>
supposedly going on.  You can watch and determine the facts for yourself.
<br>
