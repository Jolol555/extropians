<br>
<p><em>   &gt; No, Berlin eventually surrendered.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I can’t imagine a more determined defense of their capital city than the
<br>
Germans put up in Berlin, it was one of the bloodiest battles of the war.
<br>
The Soviets had to fight quite literally for every foot they took toward the
<br>
center of the city and the fighting didn’t stop until they were about 100
<br>
yards from the German leader who decided, quite sensibly, that at that point
<br>
the wisest thing for him to do is put a bullet in his brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would note also that the Soviet forces advance on Berlin was extremely
<br>
poorly handled strategically.  Stalin presented an insane push to get the
<br>
troops to Berlin as fast as possible, and went so far to generate a rivalry
<br>
between the two generals advancing on Berlin, one from the South and one
<br>
from the North, each one knowing they would be recieved as national heroes
<br>
if they were the first to reach Berlin.  The Germans were equally insistent
<br>
on fighting the Soviet's off because they knew the retribution they would
<br>
receive from the soviets would far exceed those received from the Americans,
<br>
specifically because of the attrocious battle of Stalingrad, were some 10
<br>
million soviets were killed.  The general advancing from the west unleashed
<br>
a tremendous artillery barrage on what he thought was the German front line
<br>
defense, unfortunately one of his own soldiers had been captured by the
<br>
Germans and informed them of the Soviet offensive the next day, the Germans
<br>
promptly moved thier defense line back out of the way of the barrage.  That
<br>
intense shelling then created a difficult to pass terrain for the Soviet
<br>
tanks.  The soviet tanks advanced through Berlin without securing areas and
<br>
recieved a large amount of anti-tank fire from buildings all around them.
<br>
The losses were extremely heavy, and much more than was necessary.
<br>
Historical analysts believe that Stalin was pushing so hard on Berlin, at
<br>
the cost of millions of troops, because he wanted to get there before the
<br>
Americans did.  That he wanted to do because he had information of a
<br>
facility that was researching fission weapons inside of Berlin, and Stalin
<br>
wanted that information before the Americans.
<br>
<p>Needles to say, no such hasty push is likely with the US advancing on
<br>
Baghdad, so I dont think allied forces advancing on Berlin will result in
<br>
similiar causalties levels.
