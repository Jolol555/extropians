<p>
I'm working on this problem right now; its both very difficult and very easy
<br>
at the same time
<br>
<p>we need a spacefaring version of the model T, or better yet a space
<br>
Winnebago like in that shitty starwars spoof.  Getting established off-world
<br>
is of critical importance, as it insures the survival of the species.  A few
<br>
small colonies wont do the trick either.
<br>
<p>In my view, a goal of 1000 self sufficient habitats w/ &gt; 10,000 residents
<br>
should be set for 2050
<br>
this *can* be done using existing technology.  It would be enormously
<br>
expensive, hard, and require a lot of sacrifice. many, many people would die
<br>
trying.  If I could go to space now as part of such an effort, knowing that
<br>
there was a 90% chance of not surviving past 40, I would do it with only a
<br>
slight hesitation...I'm 23 now...
<br>
<p>I've been working on a paper outlining such a possibility for the past week
<br>
or so, I hope to be done within a couple days....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I generally agree, but what practical steps can you take now to attain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this goal in the future?  After all, I don't have several billion USD I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can use to, say, fund a Mars Direct mission or build a few space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; settlements.:)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think space tourism might start to build a space infrastructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helpful for human migration to space.  What say you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Later!
