<p><em>&gt; Is patriotism an Extropic value?
</em><br>
<p>I would say No, except under certain circumstances.  Generally,
<br>
patriotism is neither extropian nor anti-extropian, but orthogonal.
<br>
<p>In some societies, such as ancient Athens, patriotism would
<br>
indeed be an extropian virtue.  Were the city-state of Athens
<br>
to be extinguished circa 500 B.C., it would have been a 
<br>
terrible setback for extropianism.
<br>
<p>Our own situation is only partly parallel.  Firstly, Athens
<br>
was unique, whereas no Western country is unique.  Secondly,
<br>
imagine a hypothetical situation wherein no citizen of any
<br>
Western nation had an ounce of patriotism.  In this event,
<br>
either the German Reich or the Soviet State would have
<br>
completely dominated the world long before this.
<br>
<p>Thus, on my analysis, the first factor speaks against,
<br>
and the second factor speaks in favor, of patriotism
<br>
being an extropian value. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Related to this, is nationalism an Extropic value?
</em><br>
<p>As you pointed, out these terms are objectively too 
<br>
similar under the current context to warrant separate
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, during this time of crisis -- as well as during many others --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who disagree over foreign policy issues often accuse each other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of not being patriotic -- or not patriotic enough.  So determining just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what stance or behavior is patriotic might be hard to pin down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _objectively_ in any case.
</em><br>
<p>As a devout realist, I revel in objectively determining
<br>
anything that I can get away with.  Patriotism, simply,
<br>
is love of country in the same way as parents love children.
<br>
The love can be so intense that it colors all views, and
<br>
only with the greatest difficulty permits dealing rationally
<br>
with the brutal, emotionally unwelcome, reality.
<br>
<p>It may take a man some time before he can recognize and
<br>
admit to himself that his son is a drunkard, and yet still
<br>
he will put the best possible face on the situation, and
<br>
rejoice in each little positive sign with great optimism.
<br>
Yet despite everything, he still must do what needs to be
<br>
done, if he's truly to help his son.
<br>
<p>Thus even an American who deeply loves his country, and
<br>
always sees the actions of his nation in the best possible
<br>
light, might finally be driven to despair, and forced,
<br>
however obliquely, to repudiate the actions taken by his
<br>
country.
<br>
<p>Yet just as you can distinguish the man who deeply loves
<br>
his son from the man who merely tolerates his adopted son,
<br>
so can you sense and hear in every syllable the fundamental
<br>
emotion of those who criticize their own nations.  In the
<br>
final analysis, it really is a question of whose side you're on.
<br>
<p>Lee
