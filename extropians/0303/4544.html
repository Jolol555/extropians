<em>&gt; If a &quot;Uniting for Peace&quot; resolution were adopted by the General
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assembly threatening military retaliation or economic sanctions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the United States, would the world's largest military 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powers break into a new set of alliances in order to enforce it? 
</em><br>
<p>WWI started when Austro-Hungary punished Serbia, a client state of
<br>
Russia, for the assasination of its heir by a Serb. Russia declared war
<br>
in response, which Germany responded to, which France responded to,
<br>
etc...
<br>
<p>In this case, Iraq is a client state of France, Germany, and Russia,
<br>
all three nations which need their trade with the US far more than the
<br>
US needs trade with them. Since all three nations seem to be making
<br>
their decision to oppose us specifically on commercial interests, logic
<br>
follows they will continue to follow the money trail and will not
<br>
declare war on the US, a trading partner they need far more than they
<br>
need Iraq. Should they be stupid enough to do so despite the logic,
<br>
they will find they really have no military capability, even  combined,
<br>
short of their ICBM nuclear forces, which in any way challenges the US.
<br>
<p>So there you have it: they are both industrially and militarily weak
<br>
compared to the US, and their exploitable natural resources are far
<br>
less. WWI and WWII were only won because the industrial might of the US
<br>
was brought into the picture.
<br>
<p>THe only wild card would be if China decided to jump into an anti-US
<br>
war alliance.
<br>
<p>Face with such might, we wouldn't be alone. We'd have the UK,
<br>
Australia, Japan, Spain, and a number of eastern european nations, plus
<br>
we'd have a window of time before the anti-US forces could mobilize to
<br>
force a reformation of middle eastern governments along democratic
<br>
lines with pro-US parties in power. Heck, Canada might even get off
<br>
it's tush.
