<em>&gt; REgarding Google removing data from the web: yeah, so? Google isn't the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; web, and its owners can remove whatever they want from their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; servers. That isn't censorship, that is version management.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RE: much about al Jazeera being off the internet...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having heard that the NY Stock Exchange has decertified Al Jazeera's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correspondent at the exchange, I think that either a) some pissed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hackers have whacked Al Jazeera's server, or b) given that al Jazeera
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will likely come under prosecution for war crimes (making POWs a public
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spectacle and contributing to their humiliation) they might have even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been pulled offline by their own government at this point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I've repeatedly stated on this list, it appears that far too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are either ignorant of the Geneva Conventions, or just don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give a damn about them. Do you think they are rules that only the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be held to? Don't you realize that if one side tosses out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Geneva Conventions, this frees the other to do the same? Do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they only apply to military units when their own country isn't under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Today we saw a lot of evidence that Saddam and his henchmen have tossed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the rulebook wholesale. They are using human shields, they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dressing in civilian clothes, they are faking surrenders as a means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambush, they are using hospitals as bases of operations for military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks, they are hiding in cemetaries, they are shooting civilians who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are revolting against them, and they are even dressing up as American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; troops and taking the surrender of other Iraqi troops only to shoot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them for doing so. I would not be surprised if many of the 'human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shields' are their own men dressed as civilians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Much has been trumpeted on this list by people like Samantha, Hubert,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amara, Naddy, and others that they consider the US to be the big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat. Who is it that is breaking the rules here? Not the US. Who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it that is violating human rights willy-nilly? Not the US.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our forces are struggling not just to free people who want to be freed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our forces are working hard to get them aid so they can eat and drink
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tomorrow, while Khofi Annan has abdicated UN responsibility for any aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to people in Iraq, and Turkey is only interested in using the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity to eliminate Kurd forces, and the socialist/communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organizations around the world continue to demonstrate they are not for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human rights, they are not for democracy or freedom. They are only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in subverting the rule of law and attacking the real bastion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of liberty in the world.
