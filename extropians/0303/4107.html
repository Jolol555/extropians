This book is available for free(!) download from
<br>
<a href="http://www.craphound.com/down/download.php">http://www.craphound.com/down/download.php</a>.  I haven't been able to get
<br>
into it well enough to get past the first few chapters, but it seemed
<br>
readable enough and moved along well.  I'll try to get back to it when
<br>
I have a chance.  For me, there's quite a difference between a physical
<br>
book which you have sitting around to remind you to read it and an
<br>
electronic book which is buried in a directory somewhere on your disk.
<br>
<p>The author, Cory Doctorow, got considerable publicity for making the book
<br>
available in this way, in addition to having it for sale in the stores.
<br>
Some people predicted that this is the wave of the future, that the
<br>
sales of the physical book would actually be increased by having the
<br>
book available for free online.  It will be interesting to see how this
<br>
book does, as a test case.
