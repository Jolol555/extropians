<p>Nanotechnology: Congress Thinks Big About Small Tech. Nanotechnology experts
<br>
told Congress
<br>
Wednesday that pending legislation in the House and the Senate is a
<br>
&quot;significant step&quot; in
<br>
overcoming the current obstacles facing the fledgling industry. Bills in
<br>
both houses would
<br>
dedicate more than $2 billion over three years for nanotechnology research
<br>
and development
<br>
programs...The House legislation is expected to be reported to the House
<br>
floor as early as
<br>
next month while Senate Commerce Committee Chairman John McCain (R.-Ariz.)
<br>
has put the
<br>
legislation on the fast track. (Internet News 3/20/03)

<p>New Measurements Show Silicon Nanospheres Rank Among Hardest Known
<br>
Materials. University of
<br>
Minnesota researchers have made the first-ever hardness measurements on
<br>
individual silicon
<br>
nanospheres and shown that the nanospheres' hardness falls between the
<br>
conventional hardness
<br>
of sapphire and diamond, which are among the hardest known materials. Being
<br>
able to measure
<br>
such nanoparticle properties may eventually help scientists design low-cost
<br>
superhard
<br>
materials from these nanoscale building blocks. (NSF 3/20/03)

<p>Nanotechnology Could Block Viruses from Entering Cells. Researchers hope to

stop viruses such
<br>
as HIV from entering cells by using nanotechnology to create tiny particles

<br>
the virus,&quot; says

<p>Gold &quot;Nanoplugs&quot; Wire Up Enzymes. Could yield biosensors with greater
<br>
sensitivity,
<br>
specificity. Scientists at Hebrew University, Israel, in collaboration with
<br>
researchers at
<br>
the U.S. Department of Energy's Brookhaven National Laboratory, have devised
<br>
a way to use
<br>
gold nanoparticles as tiny electrical wires to plug enzymes into electrodes.
<br>
The gold
<br>
&quot;nanoplugs&quot; help align the molecules for optimal binding and provide a
<br>
conductive pathway for
<br>
the flow of electrons. The research, described in the March 21, 2003, issue
<br>
of Science, may
<br>
yield more sensitive, inexpensive, noninvasive detectors for measuring
<br>
biological molecules,
<br>
including, potentially, agents of bioterrorism.-Two images- (3/20/03

<p>Students glimpse the future. And it's tiny. After weeks of preparation, the
<br>
teams finally
<br>
face the test. They must examine the prospects and pitfalls of using
<br>
nanotechnology aboard
<br>
the space station Athena in the year 2033. What could the tiny science do
<br>
for surveillance
<br>
and defense, the competitors asked themselves. Where would it fall short?
<br>
Now, chatting
<br>
heatedly and scribbling furiously, they spend the next two hours applying
<br>
themselves to the
<br>
task. Finally the time is up. Pencils are set down and a lively discussion
<br>
of nano-technology
<br>
ensues. Not bad for a group of elementary school students. Students at the
<br>
Dutch Hill
<br>
Elementary School in Snohomish, Wash., are among several hundred thousand
<br>
students across the
<br>
country who this year are devoting class time to nanotechnology - the
<br>
science of manipulating
<br>
structures from the atom up, or literally, the technology of one-billionth.

<p>Porous ceramic can sort proteins magnetically. In recent years chemists and

materials
<br>
scientists have enthusiastically searched for ways to make materials with

nanoscale pores --

channels comparable in size to organic molecules -- that could be used,
<br>
among other things,
<br>
to separate proteins by size. Recently Cornell University researchers

developed a method to

&quot;self-assemble&quot; such structures by using organic polymers to guide the

formation of ceramic

<p>Carnegie Mellon University chemists create versatile polymer brushes. Many
<br>
potential
<br>
applications. Carnegie Mellon University scientists are creating molecularly
<br>
engineered
<br>
polymer brushes using a revolutionary catalytic polymerization procedure
<br>
developed in their
<br>
laboratory. These nanoscale brushes have numerous potential applications in
<br>
a number of
<br>
fields, including medicine, computers and environmental engineering,
<br>
according to Krzysztof
<br>
Matyjaszewski, professor of chemistry at Carnegie Mellon and director of the
<br>
Center for
<br>
Macromolecular Engineering at the Mellon College of Science. Professor
<br>
Matyjaszewski is
<br>
presenting his most recent findings on these nanoscale marvels Tuesday,
<br>
March 25, in the
<br>
opening lecture of a session on polymer brushes at the American Chemical
<br>
Society's (ACS)
<br>
225th annual meeting in New Orleans. (NanoApex 3/25/03)
