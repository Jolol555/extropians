<p><em>&gt; Perhaps a better analogy is this: trying to decide whether re-runs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good is like trying to decide whether solipsism is correct. Today
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solipsism can be refuted, by Occam's Razor (or Kolmogorov's Razor to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; borrow Eliezer's term), but realizing this required the invention of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; algorithmic information theory (which includes a definition of simplicity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is mathematically rigorous and more or less self-evident). Before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, different people had different intutions about what was simplier:  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that only I exist, or that the whole universe exists? And there was no way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to convince someone whose intuition differed from you.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good point, these tools give us powerful new insights into some
<br>
old ethical problems.  However, solipsism was not a successful philosophy
<br>
even before anyone had heard of Kolmogorov complexity.  People were able
<br>
to reject it and make progress on moral arguments without that tool.
<br>
It is in that spirit that I think we can make progress on the issue
<br>
of copies.  We may not have mathematical proof, but we can still come up
<br>
with arguments that give us good reasons to believe one way or the other.
<br>
<p>In the case of copies, consider an experiment where we are simulating
<br>
someone and can give them either a good or bad experience.  Let's not
<br>
even suppose these are replays, they are new experiences which we can
<br>
accurately anticipate will be pleasant or unpleasant.
<br>
<p>Suppose we are going to flip a biased quantum coin, one which has a 90%
<br>
chance of coming up heads.  We will generate the good or bad experience
<br>
depending on the outcome of the coin flip.  I claim that it is obvious
<br>
that it is better to give the good experience when we get the 90% outcome
<br>
and the bad experience when we get the 10% outcome.  That's the assumption
<br>
I will start with.
<br>
<p>Now consider Tegmark's level 1 of parallelism, the fact that in a
<br>
sufficiently large volume of space I can find a large number of copies
<br>
of me, in fact copies of the entire earth and our entire visible universe
<br>
(the &quot;Hubble bubble&quot;?).  When I do my quantum coin flip, 90% of the copies
<br>
will see it come up heads and cause the good experience for the subject,
<br>
and 10% will see tails and cause the bad experience.
<br>
<p>I will also assume that my knowledge of this fact about the physical
<br>
universe will not change my mind about the ethical value of my decision
<br>
to give the good experience for the 90% outcome.
<br>
<p>Now the problem is this.  There are really only two different programs
<br>
being run for our experimental subject, the guy in the simulation.  One is
<br>
a good experience and one is bad.  All my decision does is to change how
<br>
many copies of each of these two programs are run.  In making my decision
<br>
about which experiences to assign to the two coin flip outcomes, I have
<br>
chosen that the copies of the good experience will outnumber copies of
<br>
the bad experience by 9 to 1.
<br>
<p>But if I don't believe that the number of copies being run makes a
<br>
difference, then I haven't accomplished what I desired.  The fact that
<br>
I am running more copies of the good program than the bad wouldn't make
<br>
any difference.  Therefore there is no actual ethical value in what I
<br>
have done, I might have just as validly reversed the outcome of my coin
<br>
flips and it wouldn't have made any difference.
<br>
<p>In this way I reach a contradiction between the belief that the number
<br>
of copies doesn't matter, the belief that the existence of distant
<br>
parallel copies of myself doesn't make much difference in what I should
<br>
do, and the idea that there is value in making people happy.  Of these,
<br>
the most questionable seems to be the assumption that copies don't matter,
<br>
so this line of reasoning turns me away from that belief.
<br>
<p>I can come up with similar contradictions from simpler cases like
<br>
our own observations of subjective probability.  The fact that I do
<br>
experience a subjective 90% chance of seeing the quantum coin come
<br>
up heads corresponds very well with the fact that 90% of the copies
<br>
of me will see heads - but only if I assume that the multiplicity of
<br>
the copies matters.  After the coin flip, in a certain voume of space
<br>
there are 90 copies of me that see heads and 10 copies that see tails.
<br>
But within the two groups all copies are identical (neglecting other
<br>
quantum events which would further split me).  If the multiplicity
<br>
doesn't count, then there are really just two outcomes and I might
<br>
expect to subjectively experience equal probability for them.
<br>
<p>This is a variant on an old argument against the MWI, but in that case I
<br>
always felt the answer was &quot;measure&quot;, that some of the outcomes occured
<br>
in a quantum branch which had this intangible quality which made it count
<br>
more.  In this case I can't invoke any such magic; all the copies of me
<br>
are running in the same universe and with equal quantum amplitude.  I have
<br>
to resort to counting the instances separately and assuming that each one
<br>
makes its own independent contribution to my subjective experiences, in
<br>
order to gain correspondence with subjective probability.  Therefore it
<br>
is most consistent to say that separate runs of identical programs do
<br>
&quot;count&quot;, they do add to the measure of the subjective experience.
<br>
