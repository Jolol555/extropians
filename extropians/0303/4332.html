Perhaps you are right.  Of course, the only way to get the right to use 
<br>
MSOffice is going to be to install it under MSwindows, and MSwindows is 
<br>
becoming less and less friendly to having other OSs on the same 
<br>
computer.  So you are going to be needing to analyse the software while 
<br>
using a legal copy of MSWindows.  This means your tools need to run 
<br>
under MSwindows.  And MSOS is going to ensure that only approved 
<br>
programs are allowed to execute....
<br>
<p>It may be possible.  Perhaps.  If you have enough money.  And a good 
<br>
enough lawyer.  But I expect that the new license agreements for the 
<br>
MSTools will say that you can't use them to reverse engineer protected 
<br>
software.  Or they may just refuse to do it.
