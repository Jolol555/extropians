So.....what are the Ragheads doing to our guys?
<br>
<p>Drugs?  Beatings?
<br>
<p>Is this in accordance with the rules of war?

<br>
<p>Strange, when I see news footage of Iraqi's I hardly see any of them wearing the headgear so popular among the Saudi people.  But even though I think Saudi Arabia is the next nation on the list we should invade (support of terrorist groups, severe human rights violations on their own people &amp; some of ours who work there).  Yet I still would not call them &quot;ragheads.&quot;  I just don't think that term should be used on this list.
<br>
<p>I will say Mick happens to be a truck driver and is probably a little rough around the edges in some ways most of us are not.  But I still would not want to make allowances when he experiences great anger over the vicious, mafia-style murders of U.S. servicemen carried out by the thugs in the service of Saddam Hussein and then uses such an epithet to show his rage.  I tend to think &quot;human scum&quot; is a better term because it condemns the individuals who did this war crime and does not make a sweeping putdown of all Arabs.  
<br>
<p>I was surprised to see no one bring up this matter.  Perhaps not enough time had elapsed, or maybe some of the folks here were nervous about raising the ire of some of the more vocal American listmembers.   
<br>
<p>I really don't think they care about the western concept known as the Geneva Convention...  I am really looking forward to learning Saddam Hussein is dead.  And I relish the idea of him experiencing the agonizing emotions of fear and dread before the end, considering all the rape and death he has ordered done to others in the course of his life.   
<br>
<p>best wishes,
<br>
<p>John
