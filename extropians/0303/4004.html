<p>As would we all -- but there is no cheat code at the moment. Either you take
<br>
up calorie restriction to extend your life, or you cross your fingers and
<br>
hope that you beat the technology curve as-is.

<br>
<p>Expect to see more legislation late this year or early next year targeting
<br>
life extension research and/or supplements. Unless we get out there and do
<br>
something. It's important to realize that the council on bioethics isn't
<br>
actually looking and thinking -- it's expressing and trying to
<br>
justify/legitimize opinions that its members already have. In fact, they
<br>
were selected precisely because they have these opinions: this is part of a
<br>
process to prevent changes to the human condition, including life extension.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2) Help the cause: advocate life extension, protest the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criminalization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; regenerative medicine/stem cell/theraputic cloning research, help
</em><br>
<em>&gt; form the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; necessary activist groups to increase the flow of capital into anti-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aging,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life-extension research.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are there any reputable non-profits that actually fund longevity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research?
</em><br>
<p>Good question. The answer is going to be yes, with qualifications as
<br>
follows:
<br>
<p>1) Putting a dollar into research is less valuable than putting a dollar
<br>
into advocacy right now. The research is in danger of being legislated out
<br>
of existence: can't pay for what has been criminalized and isn't taking
<br>
place.
<br>
<p>2) It is as beneficial to be putting research money into age-related
<br>
condition non-profits. Have a look at this article:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org/articles/viewarticle.cfm?page=1&amp;article_id=12">http://www.longevitymeme.org/articles/viewarticle.cfm?page=1&amp;article_id=12</a><br>
<p>and its suggestions on what aging actually is. So stumping up for
<br>
Alzheimer's, heart disease, cancer, etc, etc -- the things that happen to a
<br>
lot of people (including you, eventually) will be just as good for extending
<br>
life as funding a non-profit that specifically looks into anti-aging
<br>
medicine.
<br>
<p>Ok, so that said, I think that the Life Extension Foundation funds research
<br>
(www.lef.org) and has a membership program that is very beneficial in any
<br>
case.
<br>
<p>I'm drawing a blank on others: a little help, guys?
