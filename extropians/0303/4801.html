<br>
X-Mailer: YaBB
<br>
<p><p>Okay, I've got it. A company operating in some war-torn hellhole region.
<br>
<p>Assets:
<br>
<p>An airfield stocked with the most effective aircraft and munitions their
<br>
budget will allow. The key is the ability to absolutely outgun any local
<br>
warlords. In fact, that would determine the geographical extent of the first
<br>
'service region'.
<br>
<p>A website, sales brochures, etc. containing detailed maps of the service
<br>
region, with coordinates.
<br>
<p>Revenue Stream:
<br>
<p>Without prejudice, any individual is allowed order an airstrike on any
<br>
set of coordinates (except the airfield itself, duh!). The cost of an
<br>
airstrike reflects the actual expenses incurred in launching it plus whatever
<br>
profit margin the market will bear. Since it's likely that even a light
<br>
airstrike will be far beyond the budget of any but the richest citizens,
<br>
the company will maintain an &quot;Airstrike Fund&quot; for every possible set of
<br>
coordinates in the service area. Once the fund for a given set of coordinates
<br>
surpasses the price for a particular type of airstrike, that airstrike is
<br>
launched. There are separate funds for different categories of airstrike,
<br>
and a fund that will automatically empty out into the airstrike fund that's
<br>
closest to its set-point. There is also an anti-airstrike fund which is used
<br>
to raise the bar on the airstrike funds that it specifies. Finally, there is
<br>
MAD-insurance. It's an arrangement that if coordinates of your choosing are
<br>
subjected to an airstrike, an amount of money you pre-specify is automatically
<br>
transferred into the airstrike fund or funds of your choosing. This means that
<br>
areas with an economic value will be better defended than areas whose value is
<br>
purely tactical... fortresses don't pay for themselves; factories do.
<br>
<p>Everyone wins, not just the company offering this service:
<br>
<p>The most violent players in the region spend the most money, and make the
<br>
most enemies, and effectively make it impossible for themselves to rely on
<br>
any large, permanent structures. True, perpetrators of violence can choose
<br>
not to do business with the most effective violence-management agent in the
<br>
region, but then there's the fear that their competitors will do business
<br>
and have that advantage. The common people still have means of defending
<br>
themselves, by chipping into airstrike funds and/or anti-airstrike funds
<br>
and/or MAD-insurance. Furthermore, loss of human life will decrease, since
<br>
the status of airstrike funds for all coordinates will be public knowledge,
<br>
and freely available in a convenient graphical form at all locations where
<br>
airstrike fund deposits are accepted.
<br>
<p>Exit Strategy:
<br>
<p>Peace is expected to eventually break out in the region, if only because
<br>
customers who spend more on warfare than on constructive activities will
<br>
inevitably go bankrupt. A new franchise is opened in some other wartorn region
<br>
(helped by news coverage and word-of-mouth regarding the company's previous
<br>
successes), and most of the military assets are transferred there. The
<br>
long-term loan, consulting, and construction branch of the company comes in
<br>
to help rebuild the region. Company policy stipulates that company assets and
<br>
personnel absolutely may not ever be bombed.
<br>
<p><p>Obstacles/Challenges:
<br>
<p>Misguided public outrage is expected on 'moral' grounds, particularly in the
<br>
West, particularly from people who have not read the full business plan. PR
<br>
and educational efforts may help ameliorate this.
<br>
<p>Certain nations whose state-run violence management agencies depend on
<br>
protectionist measures are likely to see their business threatened. The key is
<br>
to locate the first franchises carefully, in regions with a lot of potential
<br>
customers, yet of little interest to the major state-run violence-management
<br>
monopolies. Also, these agencies and the states sponsoring them could be
<br>
brought on-board as external customers, vendors, and investors.
<br>
<p>After several years of operation, competitors and imitators will undoubtedly
<br>
spring up. The potential market is quite large, and can accomodate these
<br>
newcomers. Indeed, they may even drive public acceptance and awareness of this
<br>
product. The main risk to avert is economic competition turning military. The
<br>
answer is through interlocking non-aggression pacts protecting the assets
<br>
of all companies from each other, along with an agreement to honour the
<br>
anti-airstrike funds of each others' clients.
<br>
<p>The main problem is that of initial investement because this idea's bold
<br>
nature and the manu uncertainties involved in modern warfare. Perhaps the
<br>
first step would be a feasibility study done with market simulations, along
<br>
with efforts to publicise the idea.
<br>
<p><p>This business plan is free for the taking to anybody crazy enough to do so.
<br>
;-)
