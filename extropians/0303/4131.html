<p>I agree with you that &quot;copies don't matter&quot; probably isn't true. Since
<br>
everything exists, if the number of copies doesn't matter, than nothing
<br>
matters. What I reject is the idea that value is strictly proportional to
<br>
the global number of copies and with it the implication that you always do
<br>
good by re-running someone's pleasant experience. This is really obvious
<br>
to me, but we can talk more about why if you don't agree.
<br>
<p>But what to replace this with? How should copies matter? This is the
<br>
question that I don't think we'll be able to make much progress on until
<br>
we have a more general advance in moral philosophy. (Although we can
<br>
speculate on possibilities. Maybe it has something to do with distance?
<br>
Maybe the value of copies are diminished if they're close together in
<br>
space-time?)
