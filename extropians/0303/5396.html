<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20[Iraq]%20More%20enthusiasm%20than%20news%20in%20Fox's%20coverage%20of%20war">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a> writes: Ad hominem is the act of distracting people 
<br>
from the actual evidence with unrelated evidence in the hope of confusing 
<br>
them into agreeing with you even though the evidence does not support your 
<br>
position.
<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked your definition of what an Ad hominem is.  If ABC during the 
<br>
last Presidential election campaign assigned one reporter to each major party 
<br>
canidate, and the one reporter reported daily what his assigned candidate had 
<br>
done well that day, while the other reporter reported daily what his assigned 
<br>
candidate had done futilely or wrong that would be Ad hominem wouldn't it?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I think that the three major broadcasting systems have 
<br>
been so dominated by the left wing for so long that Hannity etal are 
<br>
attractive to the right wing simply because they provide balance.  This is 
<br>
not to say Hannity, etal are not partisan in orientation.
<br>
