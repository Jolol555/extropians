If any mad dictator invaded your country I would help you without even
<br>
thinking twice. When the allies occupied Germany in WW2 it was a perfectly
<br>
justified step. The &quot;ethnic cleanings&quot; that Milosevic committed probably
<br>
justified the intervention of the Nato and Saddams atrocities also had been
<br>
worth another international intervention. Nothing wrong with that.
<br>

<br>
<p>I quote &quot;The ethnic cleanings that Milosevic committed probably justified the intervention of NATO.&quot;  PROBABLY??  The U.S. and especially the European NATO members have blood on their hands for not having intervened MUCH sooner.  Thousands of lives would have been saved, not to mention the stopping of the rape camps which were set up.  PROBABLY??  
<br>
<p>he continues:
<br>
But what I fear is that this war might be the first step towards a new world
<br>
order where the law of the strongest, i. e. USA reigns. To invade a country
<br>
that did not attack you is morally despisable. Of course a rational mind
<br>
like your's will always be able to find applications to justify this action,
<br>
but it seems to me that you Americans are now stewing in your own juice. The
<br>
whole world is shouting at you and you do not want to listen anymore - I am
<br>
fighting a lost cause here on this list but on the planetary scale you are
<br>
isolated ...oh yes, of course Britain and Spain and Italy and Albania and,
<br>
but in the case of Aznar and Berlusconi: they have the vast majority of
<br>
their people against them.
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>Hubert, pre-emptive attacks (or the threat of it) on tyrannical nations appears to be the new U.S. policy and I agree with it.  Of course this does not apply so well with powerful possible enemies such as China or Russia. lol...  
<br>
<p>You make it sound like the vast population of the developed world is extremely against the U.S. overthrowing Saddam's murderous, raping regime.  I don't buy into this.  Anyway, Americans are used to bearing heavy burdens when the rest of the world cannot or will not do the right thing.  
<br>
<p>And I do realize sometimes we do make mistakes, but if we play our cards right this will not be one of them.  The U.S. (yes, and even European nations) will get the chance to create a major democracy right in the center of the Arab middle east.  This could be the beginning of the road which leads to peace in the region!  Now that is something to rejoice about.   
<br>
<p>he continues:
<br>
I will not stop shouting, I am against THIS war. You are deadly wrong and
<br>
you should hear it again every day!
<br>
(end)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I figured out a long time ago you were against this war.  You have been shown how wrong you are several times by listmembers but refuse to acknowledge it.
<br>
<p>I do respect your love of human life and desire to avoid the horror of war except when repelling an invasion.  But it's unethical (just plain wrong!) for the U.S. to standby while Saddam every year terrorizes, tortures, rapes and murders his own citizens.
<br>
<p>As the classic analogy goes, if you lived in a remote area with no police, would you just stand by as your neighbor beats and rapes his wife &amp; children regularly to gain their submission?  I get the impression you would just shrug your shoulders and say &quot;it's very sad, but it's none of my business!&quot;
<br>
<p>Hubert, it's when people like you get into positions of power that the Saddam's and Hitler's of the world are allowed to thrive.
