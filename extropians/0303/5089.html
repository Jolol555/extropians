</em><br>
Yes, to a minor degree.  I'm basically non-political (i.e., all the 
<br>
parties disgust me).  But I have taken part in a couple of protests.  I 
<br>
expected at the time that it was futile.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Additionally, I would be curious to know if you if you organized or 
</em><br>

</em><br>

No.  They didn't claim to represent me.

<p><em>&gt;South in March 1972? How about France's unilateral decision to remove Emperor

<em>&gt;Jean Bedel Bokassa  from the Central African Empire in 1979?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Ditto.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If the answer is no, then you do not diminish Lee's main argument that these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;anti-war&quot; and even worse &quot;peace&quot; (whatever that fanciful concept means to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;million different people) protesters ONLY criticize US intervention abroad.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I protest when those who claim to represent me engage in actions I find 
<br>
immoral.  (It's less than clear to me what sense it makes to protest 
<br>
someone who doesn't claim to represent me anyway.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And these protesters do this despite the fact that said interventions, like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the US's in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Korea, have the potential to significantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;better the quality of life for the people in those countries, unlike most of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Getting bombs dropped on you head always improves your viewpoint.  And 
<br>
having your water supplies destroyed.  etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Are you going to seriously argue that the Iraqi people will not benefit from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the removal of Saddam Hussein? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
If that were the only effect, then I wouldn't make that assertion.  But 
<br>
actually I expect that to be a minor benefit that they may obtain, if 
<br>
the puppet we put in isn't even worse.  (Remember, we put him in 
<br>
originally.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Let me address this on two points. First, you are being intellectually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dishonest if you are in any way suggesting that the United States is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intentionally attempting to inflict mass casualties on the Iraqi people. They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
They are doing it intentionally in the sense that they are criminally 
<br>
negligent if they didn't know ahead of time that this would happen.  I'm 
<br>
not claiming that they planned to do it, but rather that they had to 
<br>
know that this would be one of the effects.  &quot;Collateral damage&quot; I 
<br>
believe the term is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And please correct me if I'm wrong Charles, but if you accept that Hussein 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;is (or was) evil&quot; then you must then accept the conservative estimates that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;he is responsible for the deaths of at least 200,000 of his own people. If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I don't have any basis to accept or reject any particular set of 
<br>
numbers.  But there's a big difference between his doing it and our 
<br>
doing it.  If he does it, then he is the villian.  If we do it, then we 
<br>
are. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...That being said, in the long run, more lives will be saved through our &quot;war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of aggression&quot; than by allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power. Not to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This may or may not be true.  It remains to be proven.  Sometimes we 
<br>
have replaced one vile madman with another, sometimes we have improved 
<br>
things, sometimes we have made them worse.  Usually on close examination 
<br>
it turns out that we acted in what we saw as our own self-interest, and 
<br>
any moralistic hand-wringing was just that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;mention the fact that the quality of life of the people of Iraq will be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;improved, just as &quot;amazingly&quot; happens almost every time the United States 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;intervenes abroad. I think we all recall the South Koreans, Greeks, Japanese, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;West Germans, and Afghans, among others, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
MacArthur and Marshall were extraordinary generals.  And Hitler was the 
<br>
kind of villian that Hussein only has wet dreams about.  And we occupied 
<br>
Japan for twenty years.  But I can also recall many other events that 
<br>
turned out much worse.  The Dominican Republic comes to mind as an example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I would simply ask what your justification would be for removing Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hussein, since apparently our own defense and improving the quality of life 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the Iraqis are not sufficient in your view. And again, I hope that I will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I haven't seen any convincing evidence that he was a threat to us.  It's 
<br>
true my evidence that he wasn't is quite weak, but not, I think, as weak 
<br>
as relying on the honestly of a Prince (i.e., Bush, but the reference 
<br>
was via Machievelli).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;see you consistently bash the French as &quot;hypocrites&quot; in the future, given 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that they opted to remove a brutal regime that was of absolutely no threat to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The French have taken the position they have at least in part because we 
<br>
are cutting them out of the oil.  Is that what you mean?  Yes, when they 
<br>
are moralistic at this position then they are hypocritical.  But they 
<br>
aren't claiming to represent me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...Indeed, I see absolutely no differences between Saddam and Bokassa's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regimes beyond the fact that it is Saddam Hussein who has and continues to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I haven't looked at the Bokassa regime.  I doubt that I would approve, 
<br>
but as far as I know I'm neither supporting nor opposing them.  The 
<br>
world's a bit place, and I don't see it as my job to try to police the 
<br>
whole thing.  (And I'd rather that it didn't try to police me, either.  
<br>
So, e.g., I'm against the WTO.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ever vigilant for signs of further French wars of aggression,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Max Plumm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
OK.  Do they represent you?
