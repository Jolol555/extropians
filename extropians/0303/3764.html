<p><em>&gt; I think that Video is a much better medium than Writing.  It will have huge 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impacts on the general public when anyone can make and distribute them.
</em><br>
<p>It already has.  The generations coming up just aren't up to 19th
<br>
century standards of literacy (given the same educational investment
<br>
time).  At least when I read what those people wrote back and forth
<br>
to each other in their letters---often when they were just teens---
<br>
I realize that there is no way I was in their league at the same
<br>
age, and even now probably am not.  But one only needs to read the
<br>
Gettysburg Address or any number of other works to see the difference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If a book could be completely changed, without leaving anything out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into video it would be a much better source.
</em><br>
<p>That's an awfully big &quot;if&quot;.  You simply couldn't write a video
<br>
that explicates, for example, economics.  Too many abstractions.
<br>
Yet understanding these abstractions is essential to understanding
<br>
how the world really works.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Our minds will change and eventually learn to accept information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in video form as well as we do in written form.
</em><br>
<p>We'll be vastly the poorer for it, although the prejudice you
<br>
have against the written word is extremely common, I've noticed,
<br>
in people under 30.  A highly intelligent friend of mine simply
<br>
cannot stand to read anything substantial (except computer
<br>
manuals) because the bandwidth bothers him so.  Why should he
<br>
read a book when he can absorb ten or a hundred times as much
<br>
information while watching a movie?  A large part of his
<br>
intelligence is simply going to waste IMO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The alphabet is Primitive.  Only 26 letters for English.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's time to move on.
</em><br>
<p>The alphabet may actually be the most advanced form of writing.
<br>
The other systems, logographic and syllabic, are probably less
<br>
desirable and efficient on the whole.  When you look at a
<br>
logographic character, e.g., Chinese, you may or may not exactly
<br>
remember what it means.  A row of them, even with their inevitable
<br>
punctuation markings, don't tend to afford amateur readers of
<br>
Japanese or Chinese the yes/no meanings we have with alphabetical
<br>
(i.e. fewer than 40 symbols) or syllabaries (80-200) characters.
<br>
<p>Kids a lot brighter than most Western children nonetheless have
<br>
to spend eight years or more to become capable of reading Chinese,
<br>
whereas it takes about half that time to learn to read a
<br>
language based on an alphabet.
<br>
<p>Best of all, alphabets allow you to easily look up words in a
<br>
dictionary.  You ought to see how they organize Chinese dictionaries!
<br>
<p>Quite often, videos and CDs do enhance understanding.  &quot;A picture
<br>
is worth a thousand words.&quot;  But an equally great truth, though
<br>
not an opposite is, &quot;A word can be worth a thousand pictures.&quot;
<br>
How many pictures would it take to convey &quot;expropriate&quot;,
<br>
&quot;contemptible&quot;, or &quot;increasing rarefaction&quot;?
<br>
