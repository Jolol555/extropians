</em><br>
<p>I understand -- I would consider them more &quot;partial&quot; diseases of
<br>
aging, in that they usually promote certain kinds of cancer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's a similar problem to that of using animal models. You can
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; caution when extrapolating into human aging.
</em><br>
<p>I know, I've got a recent paper on the ATM gene in Nature that
<br>
discusses the fact that the serine that gets phorphorylated to
<br>
trigger the entire cascade of DNA repair in response to ionizing
<br>
radiation only exists in the mammals and frogs -- not in the
<br>
homologues in lower organisms like C. Elegans.
<br>
<p>However, because we have all the genes recognized now, if we can't
<br>
figure out how the entire DNA repair system works in less than 5
<br>
years, then we are going to look really stupid.
<br>
<p>I'm reasonably convinced that double strand break repair is a major
<br>
cause of aging (it corrupts the code) and that how fast you age
<br>
depends a lot on whether the cells tip DSBR towards homologous
<br>
recombination (HR) which allows gene conversion, therefore increasing
<br>
the likelyhood of cancer or non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ)
<br>
which literally corrupts the code.  Corrupting the code is very
<br>
bad from a programmer's point of view -- from a biologist's point
<br>
of view it leads to a number of downstream negative consequences.
<br>
<p>I think how fast and in which tissues you age depends to a large
<br>
extent on whether DSBR is tipped towards HR or NHEJ.  Either path
<br>
is likely to involve some of the DNA repair genes that either contribute
<br>
to causing DSB or fixing them (you have something like 120+ DNA repair
<br>
genes but there are less than probably 2 dozen involved in the
<br>
increased cancer/aging syndromes.
<br>
<p>I've got a paper half-written about this, if I ever get it finished
<br>
I'll send you an advance copy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Finally, I have an optimistic (?) article published in this month's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue of The Futurist on aging and longevity entitled &quot;Winning the war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against aging&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I know, I saw it but haven't had a chance to read it yet.  (I get The
<br>
Futurist but rarely have time to read much in it.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, where do you live nowadays, Robert? I'm thinking of doing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postdoc in the US next year, but I'm not sure yet where will I end up.
</em><br>
<p>Right now I'm in Seattle, but things are very much up in the air
<br>
as to if and where Robiobotics may end up.  It could be Reno or
<br>
perhaps even Quebec.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
Robert
