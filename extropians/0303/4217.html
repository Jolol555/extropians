<p>
Every day TV coverage of Iraq mentions that Saddam &quot;gassed his own people.&quot;
<br>
Haven't heard much mention of Stephen Pelletiere's op ed piece in the New
<br>
York Times (Jan. 31, &quot;A War Crime or an Act of War&quot;).
<br>
<p>Pelletiere was the CIA's senior political analyst on Iraq during the 1980s
<br>
war between Iraq and Iran, and later served as a professor at the US Army
<br>
War College (1988-2000).
<br>
<p>His op ed piece attacks the theory that Saddam gassed the Kurds. You know,
<br>
&quot;Saddam gassed his own people.&quot; That oft-repeated charge that makes up a
<br>
significant part of the administration's argument for war now.
<br>
<p>Pelletiere had access to a lot of the classified data that was generated
<br>
around the Kurd matter. He was in charge of the 1991 Army probe that
<br>
investigated the question: How would Saddam fight a war against the US?
<br>
<p>The major gassing incident occurred in March 1988 at a town called Halabja.
<br>
&quot;But the truth is,&quot; Pelletiere writes, &quot;all we know for certain is that
<br>
Kurds were bombarded with poison gas that day.&quot; This occurred near the end
<br>
of the Iraq-Iran
<br>
war.
<br>
<p>Pelletiere writes, &quot;immediately after the battle [at Halabja] the United
<br>
States Defense Information Agency investigated and produced a classified
<br>
report, which it circulated within the intelligence community on a
<br>
need-to-know basis. That study asserted that it was Iranian gas that killed
<br>
the Kurds, not Iraqi gas.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pelletiere goes on to write that both the Iraqis and the Iranian troops used
<br>
gas at Halabja. &quot;The condition of the dead Kurds' bodies, however, indicated
<br>
that they had been killed with a blood agent---that is, a cyanide-based
<br>
gas---which Iran was known to have. The Iraqis, who are thought to have used
<br>
mustard gas in the battle, are not known to have possessed blood agents at
<br>
the time.&quot;
<br>
<p>Remember, the charge that has been leveled at Saddam is, he gassed his own
<br>
civilians. Pelletiere is offering evidence collected by US intelligence and
<br>
military analysts that refutes that charge.
<br>
<p>Haven't heard this mentioned much by Bush, Powell, Blair, and the talking
<br>
heads on TV.
<br>
<p>Of course, if we were consistent in condemning leaders for &quot;gassing their
<br>
own people&quot; there might be a few more questions about the use of CS-gas in
<br>
the attack on the Branch Davidian &quot;compound&quot; at Waco. As I understand it,
<br>
the US had signed international treaties banning use of that chemical agent
<br>
in times of war against our enemies. Apparently our leaders will sign
<br>
treaties agreeing not to use it against our enemies, but reserve the right
<br>
to use it against domestic civilians, including women and children.
