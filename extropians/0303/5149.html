Humania opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I already told you: they hate Saddam and want him removed too, but by 
<br>
peaceful disarmament. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Firstly: No actions or protests against Iraq or Osama-but against the US
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actions speak louder than words. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;The overwhelming majority of the German people is USA friendly since 1945. 
<br>
The first - justified - break happened 1968, when leftist students protested 
<br>
against the US Vietnam politics. From then on a fraction of the German 
<br>
intelligencija kept critizing American politics or ridiculed certain aspects 
<br>
of the American way of life - quite rightly so. But Germany as a whole felt 
<br>
like it were the US' best friend. 
<br>
 
<br>
There has never been anti-Americanism as a &quot;German cultural norm&quot;.  This is 
<br>
absolutely wrong though the influence of former leftist students who gained 
<br>
power during the 1990 (Schroeder, Fischer) is of course pretty strong. But 
<br>
even Fischer who was a street fighter of the radical left in the late 1960s 
<br>
cannot be called an anti-American politician. The crucial contemporary break 
<br>
in the relations between Germany and the US happened when Bush insisted of 
<br>
waging war against Iraq.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>2ndly: Break 1 came in 1968
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Break 2 came in 1983-remember the Pershing Missles?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99 Luft Balloonz caused WW3, right? Nein! Nina was as poor a   
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;political analyst as she is a singer.      
<br>
<p>Fischer is merely a Braunshirt in Green clothing. As far as being &quot;friends&quot;, 
<br>
friends don't behave in such a manner.   You'll have to sell the notion that 
<br>
&quot;we are your friends, but not the friends of your government much harder, to 
<br>
the 70% that support the war. But my hope is that the rift between Europe 
<br>
(old) and USA can be widened politically, because with such friends, we don't 
<br>
need enemies.   Now go protest against Islamist regimes, North Korean war 
<br>
mongers, and Jihadi terrorists, and prove your dedication to peace.
<br>
<p>What does not kill me, makes me stronger! ~F. Nietszche
<br>
The funny thing is, he who said that, avoiding serving in two wars!
