</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure what distinction you're making between value and benefit.
</em><br>
<p>Values are arbitrary (in a sense), while benefit is objective.
<br>
For any given entity, especially an evolutionarily derived one,
<br>
whether or not that entity benefits from certain conditions is
<br>
more or less objective.  Of course, this leaves aside very 
<br>
problematic instances, but whether or not a person is *warm*
<br>
also has its problematic cases---yet it can be truly and 
<br>
objectively determined in the vast majority of cases whether
<br>
or not an organism is warm enough.
<br>
<p>Now *one* important aspect of benefit is the relation between
<br>
a supposed benefit and the value system of the entity in question.
<br>
In many of the problematical instances, it is exactly a conflict
<br>
on this issue that is important.  For example, is free education
<br>
a true benefit?  Or is it of any benefit?  Opinions among teens
<br>
will differ, and their own disparate value systems may ultimately
<br>
decide.  One person might conclude that a good education has very
<br>
little to do with what he wants out of life, another might value
<br>
it, but doesn't subscribe to having a time horizon (i.e., he
<br>
discounts it so heavily) that makes it worthwhile.  In addition,
<br>
for some, they will be, objectively speaking, making a mistake,
<br>
as might be appreciated a few years hence when certain realities
<br>
or data has come to their attention.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And just how will it become clear that I experience twice the benefit if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have twice the number of copies running in a given volume of spacetime?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Will I, after running multiple copies of myself, suddenly realize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth of this statement as an epiphany?
</em><br>
<p>;-)  No, of course not.  I will use my Mexican box car example.
<br>
In the summer of 1988 forty illegal Mexican immigrants were 
<br>
locked in a railroad boxcar by their coyote, and it sat several
<br>
days under the hot Texas sun.  By the time the door was opened,
<br>
quite a few were dead, and the rest horribly dehydrated.  Now
<br>
consult your own value system on an imaginary trip to the 
<br>
vicinity where all this suffering is taking place:
<br>
<p>You approach the boxcar and hear the pants, heavy breathing
<br>
and cries for help.  Would you be any less moved if you
<br>
learned that a light year away precisely the same events
<br>
were unfolding?  I think that you, like me, would intervene
<br>
and reduce the suffering even if it meant that a light year
<br>
away events would unfold precisely as they did.
<br>
<p>From this we are lead to consider our &quot;approval function&quot;.
<br>
Your approval of any process in spacetime, it seems to me,
<br>
must be additive.  If you do not have such an additive
<br>
function, then there is no reason to intervene on behalf
<br>
of the Mexicans in *this* particular boxcar (the one in
<br>
whose proximity you are).
<br>
<p>One then merely applies an objectively calibrated approval
<br>
function to one's self.  I take it that speaking purely in
<br>
terms of physics, a normal healthy Wei Dai approves of Wei
<br>
Dai type processes having a good time, or learning something,
<br>
or in some other way receiving benefit.  In terms of physical
<br>
processes, what you are really approving of is a class of
<br>
information flow and calculation.  In one enormous class of
<br>
possible processes of Wei Dai type organisms, good things are
<br>
happening to WD, and in another huge class, bad things.  If
<br>
your approval function is to be consistent---and that's really
<br>
all we can ask in the final analysis---then from the foregoing
<br>
it seems inescapable to me that you must approve twice as much
<br>
of two Wei Dai's receiving benefit as one. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We know that if you run the same computation twice in a row, it's usually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster the second time because some of the necessary data will already be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in cache. So with the same resources, the number of identical computations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can run can be higher than the number of different computations you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can run.
</em><br>
<p>A very interesting point.  The problem, however, is that you are
<br>
cheating a little by retaining intermediate stages and thus not
<br>
re-doing the entire calculation.  This is the case of lookup tables
<br>
again.  I claim, and have always claimed, that pure lookup tables
<br>
are not conscious and can receive no benefit.
<br>
<p>What one can have, of course, is a mixture, such as I think you
<br>
are suggesting here.  Suppose that a TM has only every other
<br>
step calculated, with the other half of the steps merely looked
<br>
up.  Would one experience only half the pain, or half the
<br>
pleasure of life?  I don't know about *quantifying* it in
<br>
exactly that way, but yes, it has to be something like half.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With that in mind, consider the following thought experiment. Suppose you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run a charity, which provides memory and computational power to those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can no longer afford enough to sustain their minds. Let's say you currently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serve 4 people, all of whom are living in separate closed virtual worlds,
</em><br>
<p>and by that I take it that these are causally disjoint calculations
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and because you respect their privacy, you have no idea what's going on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside these worlds.  Three of them are identical and deterministic (so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they'll always be identical). Now suppose due to a budget crunch, you can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only support either 3 identical worlds, or 2 different worlds. Would you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always choose to terminate the one world that's different?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, provided that the lives of the inmates are worth living,
<br>
i.e., that they are receiving benefit and not being harmed.
<br>
And I will assume that, given your stipulation that I know
<br>
nothing about them.
<br>
<p>(Conversely, suppose their lives were not worth living, perhaps,
<br>
we conclude, because they are in terrible pain even though they
<br>
are so delusional that they don't even realize it.  In this case,
<br>
three separate bad experiences would be preferable to four
<br>
identical bad experiences, ignoring, of course, that we should
<br>
pull the plug on them altogether, given that that was a choice.)
<br>
<p>(Since that paragraph contains certain incendiary elements, let me
<br>
say that he who foots the bill has, IMO, final say in such matters.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or if you were to receive a budget increase, would you always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just make more copies of the person you already have, rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than consider new applications?
</em><br>
<p>If it's cheaper, then by all means.  I have never understood
<br>
why the elegance of the view endorsing repeated experience
<br>
doesn't appeal to people.  (My own private theory is that they
<br>
have not completely rooted out some feeling or notion of Cosmic
<br>
Purpose to their own existences.)
