<em>&gt; From: spike66 [mailto:<a href="mailto:spike66@attbi.com?Subject=Re:%20porn%20filter%20game">spike66@attbi.com</a>] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This CNN article describes the handwringing by parents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;who have discovered that the porn filters they have on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;their kid's internet connections can be easily defeated:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/03/14/downloading.porn/index.htm">http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/internet/03/14/downloading.porn/index.htm</a>
</em><br>

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;This gave me an idea for a fun and educational little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;game we could play...
</em><br>
<p>OK I have thought of an improvement to this idea.
<br>
We need some means of anonymizing the contestants,
<br>
so as to ensure freedom of speech.  If we had a
<br>
drop box whereby a contestant could email their
<br>
entry along with a self-chosen 5 digit identifier,
<br>
the entries could be collected and email address
<br>
info removed.
<br>
<p>For instance, if someone with an office email @
<br>
that does not carry any personal identification
<br>
were to post to extropians and volunteer to
<br>
collect the essays, and after a couple of weeks
<br>
post them with only each essay's private identifier,
<br>
we could then run them thru the filters and see
<br>
which essays pass thru whose filters.  The results
<br>
would only be identified by the number.  The
<br>
winner has the choice of outing herself or just
<br>
having the satisfaction of knowing she won.
<br>
<p>Also, contrary to the original post suggestion,
<br>
do not write about any experience you have had.
<br>
Even with the anonymizer, this experiment will
<br>
probably work better with fictional accounts.
<br>
<p>I even thought of a little Turing test we could
<br>
do, to compete human vs computer.  Clearly any human
<br>
could take a quick look at any text and immediately
<br>
tell the difference between a medical article and
<br>
even the most cleverly written cryptoporn.  But
<br>
what if we took both the porn and the articles,
<br>
removed all capitalized words, then put the remaining
<br>
words in alphabetical order.  It would be like seeing
<br>
text from the point of view of a computer, flatten
<br>
the old playing field.  Then do you believe you
<br>
could distinguish any better than the machine the
<br>
difference between the medical article and the
<br>
cryptoporn?
