<em>&gt; &gt;Amara, while I wouldn't dream of second guessing you on astronomical
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;experience in such matters as defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe that the landscape of (trans)human lives are much larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a mudball of some humans acting like monkeys (Bush being the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; head baboon). I find your view extremely limiting and self-defeating,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mike, ignoring your arrogance for the moment. I wonder if you read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of the articles that Dan posted and my one follow-up.
</em><br>
<p>Read em all, and found them very academic and with little relation to
<br>
actual military experience, as have several others on the list who have
<br>
posted to me. They are interesting as economic theory, but deal very
<br>
poorly in the essential logistical, tactical, and organizational and
<br>
educational issues which I have posed now and in the past.
<br>
<p>I have, in the past, supported the idea of partisan militia being an
<br>
effective deterrent against even 20th century degrees of military
<br>
technological sophistication in organized state agression. The sort of
<br>
warfare that the US is currently displaying, in Iraq and in
<br>
Afghanistan, could only be opposed by a significant major fraction of
<br>
the native population taking up arms actively. Even then, if the
<br>
agressor did not care about international image or media scrutiny, the
<br>
mobilization of a major fraction of the native population against the
<br>
agression could be easily eliminated by a concerted program of ethnic
<br>
cleansing. This has not never happened, rather, it describes the source
<br>
of many of the genocides of the last two centuries. It is what Stalin
<br>
did to the White Russians, and it is what happened in Rwanda and partly
<br>
happened in Serbia.
<br>
<p>I don't think you, your cited sources, or others appreciate at all how
<br>
dastardly states can get if they want what they want bad enough and are
<br>
fascist enough to be capable and willing of getting it by any means
<br>
necessary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However there are a few monkeys of a different variety:

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish humans had common ancestors with them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P.S.S  Your words here are nonsense, you know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The Soviet experience in Afghanistan is a good example of such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;conflict, yet it can be seen from the US experience there a decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;later that a certain degree of technical superiority, in both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equipment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and training, can largely eliminate any advantage the local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarchists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;may have once had, even when the conqueror is under both media
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scrutiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and feels bound by international standards of behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was almost no &quot;media scrutiny&quot;, and the Afghans defeated the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Soviets with guerilla tactics, intelligence, and after the moderates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; died or escaped, a brutal extremism that was the end result of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of fighting. Please read: Lessing's &quot;The Wind Blows Away our Words&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eye-witness accounts, and a description of how the media and the rest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the world &quot;forgot&quot; Afghanistan for many many years.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think you read that paragraph straight. I agree there was
<br>
almost no media scrutiny of the Soviet occupation *but there was for
<br>
the US investment last year*. Furthermore, you ignored my additional
<br>
caveat that anarchical partisans require 3rd party nations for support,
<br>
supply, and shelter. In the Soviet debacle, the Mujahedeen had the help
<br>
of both Iran and Pakistan as both safe areas and supply areas. They
<br>
additionally had the help of high tech weaponry from the US in the form
<br>
of the Stinger which was decisive in eliminating the air superiority of
<br>
Soviet air assets.
<br>
<p>They had so such sanctuary in the US operation of last year and
<br>
instead, the millions of refugees that found shelter in the two
<br>
neighboring nations have been getting repatriated. Since this refugee
<br>
population was so crucial as a recruiting ground for the Mujahedeen, it
<br>
is apparent that there will not be a continuing problem of any
<br>
significant scope. 
<br>
<p>THe only groups still utilizing the terrain and allies in the border
<br>
areas are the few taliban leaders and al Qaeda allies who are PNG at
<br>
least officially.
