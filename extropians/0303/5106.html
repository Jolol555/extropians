<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And please correct me if I'm wrong Charles, but if you accept that Hussein
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;is (or was) evil&quot; then you must then accept the conservative estimates
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;he is responsible for the deaths of at least 200,000 of his own people. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I don't have any basis to accept or reject any particular set of numbers.
<br>
But there's a big difference between his doing it and our doing it.  If he
<br>
does it, then he is the villian.  If we do it, then we are. &quot;
<br>
<p>Many would argue that it is unethical to NOT intervene in such attrocities.
<br>
If he is murdering his own people, intentionally and directly, he is a
<br>
villian.  However, if we attempt to stop him, as a murderous ruler, and kill
<br>
civilians in the process, we are 'the villian'?  I am curious if you equate
<br>
these two circumstances in terms of 'villany' equally, or is one action
<br>
worse or less worse than another?
<br>
<p>A strict utilitarian would probably say you should definately behave in a
<br>
manner that will cause the least number of deaths, and thus the Iraq war
<br>
would be justified.  A Kantianist abides typically by catagorical
<br>
imperitatives, that is, behaving in a manner that you feel all others should
<br>
be required to behave in a similiar situation.  If we consider Saddam as a
<br>
person instead of a regime, then killing him would both be kantianist and
<br>
utilitarian, to prevent the further murders he in all reasonable manner is
<br>
exepected to perpetuate.  If I were being beaten and hacked by Saddam, I
<br>
would expect you to intervene if you had the capability to, a Kantianist
<br>
would probably say you had the moral requirement to intervene.
<br>
<p>In other words, if you are sitting there cleaning your guns, and you are
<br>
watching your neighbor get beaten and raped, is it moral for you to sit idly
<br>
by and do nothing?  I think most systems of ethics would in fact call you
<br>
immoral for not interveneing.
<br>
<p>The situation is obviously complicated when innocents are involved.  But
<br>
again, if someone starts shooting at me and holds a child in front of him in
<br>
hopes of getting me to not shoot back, should I be held morally culpable if
<br>
that child is killed in my self defensive actions?  Its rediculous to think
<br>
I should be, but that is essentially what you are saying.  The morally
<br>
culpable party is the one who initated the act of force *and* used innocents
<br>
as sheilds.
<br>
<p>Saddam, as protocol, does this.  Military installations are routinely placed
<br>
inside of civilian areas,  If a country performs such an attrocious act,
<br>
then initates violence, is the defending party held morrally culpable when
<br>
thier retaliation kills civilians?  Thats absurd, and I cant believe you
<br>
truly hold that mentality, it just seems to fly in the face of reason.  The
<br>
morally culpable party is the shitbag that put radar installations next to
<br>
hospitals.
<br>
<p>Another dividing factor is that many do not percieve this as an act of 'self
<br>
defense' and that 'pre-emptive strikes' are not self defense.  Some list
<br>
members, such as Samantha, go so far as to insist that absolutely no
<br>
'pre-emptive' strike is moral.
<br>
<p>It again seems absurd to insist as much, to think that absolutely *any*
<br>
conceivable scenario could ever make 'pre-emptive' strikes morally valid.
<br>
Yet people who may have never heard of Kant or Rawls might insist as much.
<br>
Id like to hear someone 'prove' that a pre-emptive strike is never morally
<br>
valid.  I would, in fact, argue that in many cases a pre-emptive strike is a
<br>
moral requirement, especially in a Kantianist catagorical imperative sense.
<br>
For instance, should someone pull a gun and aim it at me, and act in a
<br>
threatening manner, must I wait for him to actually pull the trigger before
<br>
I shoot at him?
<br>
<p>For all intents and purposes, Saddam is a crazy man waving a gun around,
<br>
shouting angrily at the US, has a clear track record of murder and tyranny,
<br>
and has been trying to acquire means to increase his murder counts by orders
<br>
of magnitude.  He is a despotic ruler, and as such is not answerable to his
<br>
people.  What part of this behavior makes a 'pre-emptive' strike morally
<br>
invalid to you?
<br>
<p>The US is taking all possible measures to avoid civilian causalties,
<br>
Saddam's forces are intentionally putting *their own* civilians in harms
<br>
way, Saddam has already killed 200,000 - 1,000,000 of his own people (exiles
<br>
claim numbers as high as 1,000,000) His Anfal campaign was a deliberate
<br>
attempt to exterminate the Kurds (genocide) and resulted in nearly 200
<br>
chemical weapons attacks against the Kurds, his systemetica rape, tortue,
<br>
and execution of political opponents is documented, his has invaded
<br>
neighboring nations, attacked neighboring nations, and stands in all
<br>
likelyhood to continue committing these acts.
<br>
<p>One should be morally REQUIRED to stop such a madman from continuing such
<br>
horrendous acts.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
