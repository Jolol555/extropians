<p><em>&gt; All right. So you have in mind some ideas that the (rather

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't have any real specific examples. I was thinking that the kids 
<br>
could discover possible networks that the villagers might normally 
<br>
offhandily reject due to sociopolitical structures within the village or 
<br>
surrounding areas. Some of the villagers might have ideas about how 
<br>
things could be better managed but perhaps not in a position to question 
<br>
the current management structure. Having their ideas presented from 
<br>
outsiders w/o any kind of power-seeking agenda in the village might help 
<br>
the ideas get a better reception.
<br>
<p>The kids might run models of local transportation resources and maybe 
<br>
discover ways to 'choreograph' activities.
<br>
<p>I consider it possible that several thousand networked schoolkids, with 
<br>
hours each day to develop ideas, might think of something that you or I 
<br>
have not thought up in the couple days since this conversation started.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the story about your friend's experiences in Honduras. I'll
