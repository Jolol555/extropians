<p><em>&gt; Perhaps he takes the prize for being most offensive to you. I don't think
</em><br>
any
<br>
<em>&gt; fair-minded observer would characterize Mr. Hannity as anything less than
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; unapologetic conservative. 
</em><br>
<p>Well then I'll give you another example: approximately a year and a half
<br>
ago, during a time at which abortion doctors were being murdered by pro-life
<br>
militants, an abortion doctor appeared on FOX to be interviewed by Hannity.
<br>
Hannity refused to address the man as &quot;Dr.&quot; despite the fact that he was a
<br>
fully qualified MD. The doc politely asked Hannity to refer to him by his
<br>
proper title. Hannity refused, and then made a point of referring to him as
<br>
&quot;Mr.&quot; several more times during his scathing verbal attack against him and
<br>
abortion. Keep in mind that, as I stated above, this was during a time at
<br>
which abortion doctors were being murdered by snipers. In fact that was the
<br>
very topic of the show. 
<br>
<p>Regardless of what anyone thinks of abortion, to treat an abortion MD that
<br>
way on national television, at that moment in history, was reckless and
<br>
downright sinister. It was at that moment that I decided that Hannity had
<br>
crossed over the line from &quot;unapologetic conservative&quot; to &quot;pure asshole.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aside from the issue of whether or not &quot;Evil&quot; should be used by high-level
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; government officials, I would ask in what sense you seriously believe Bush
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;aggravated&quot; the situation in North Korea. 
</em><br>
<p>By labeling N. Korea &quot;Evil,&quot; Bush escalated the war of words and reduced the
<br>
probability that the US will be able to coordinate any kind of multilateral
<br>
effort to peacefully disarm N. Korea. 
<br>
<p>Kim Jong Li expressly complained about being labeled &quot;Evil.&quot; He took it
<br>
personally, just as anyone would, and since then he has been more
<br>
belligerent than ever. 
<br>
<p>It's not in the best interest of the US that we portray our foreign policy
<br>
as anything remotely similar to a Holy Jihad.
