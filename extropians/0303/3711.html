Joao Magalhaes asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I've been wondering on why are transhumanists so confident that we will 
<br>
reach the singularity. I'm about to finish my Ph.D. on the biology of aging 
<br>
and I've been thinking about the developments of the past few years, not 
<br>
just on aging but in other areas too. In truth, I'm disappointed with 
<br>
what's being done and I want to know why are transhumanists so confident we 
<br>
will reach the singularity.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>A few of us do not see a Singularity existing a few decades away, but rather 
<br>
centuries or milenia from now. Transhumanists and futurists tend to err on 
<br>
the side of optimism; although many journalists, writers, and 
<br>
politically-motivated scientists err on the side of pessimism and gloom.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;For instance, astrophysics and space exploration have been stagnating. It's 
<br>
been 30 years since a man walked on the moon and, though I'm not an expert, I 
<br>
don't see how our recent models of the universe--e.g. superstring theory--are 
<br>
more likely to be right than the models from Einstein's time.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>You can't legitimately say that space exploration has stagnated. Automated 
<br>
probes like Voyager have explored quite a bit of the solar system, flyby's of 
<br>
asteroids and comets and the discoveries made by the Keck 2 telescopes, and 
<br>
the Hubble telescope are quite phenomenal. Detetcting new planets through the 
<br>
motion of the parent star are also something that in the late 1970's would've 
<br>
have been deemed a faint hope.
<br>
<p>Now manned exploration has a problem with something that has slowed discovery 
<br>
and that is COST. It takes a phenomenal amount of money to spend to sustain 
<br>
human life in earth orbit and beyond. That is where the stagnation has 
<br>
occurred. If flying to the moon or a trip to Mars would be cheaper; you would 
<br>
have private industry putting people there, for the Return On Investment ROI. 
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;It's true breakthroughs have been made in biology and medicine, such as the 
<br>
Human Genome Project, but, shit, we haven't even cured AIDS, how can we 
<br>
expect to cure aging anytime soon? &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Please remember that HIV blind-sided medical science, and is perhaps the most 
<br>
adaptive virus, ever encountered. Its the 800LB Gorilla of infectious 
<br>
diseases. AIDS is also NEW, comparatively to humanity, unlike smallpox, or 
<br>
tuberculosis. To cure, and develop better treatments will take years and 
<br>
years more research, and also manage how the disease is spread-a social 
<br>
commitment
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Also, I'm disappointed with the way science is made in the academia with 
<br>
personal egos rising above finding the mechanisms of aging. If we want to 
<br>
cure aging, we need to work together, but not many do that.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Welcome to the world of academia and ego's. This, I wager, you will not be 
<br>
able to change. I am guessing that the private sector might be a better  
<br>
choice for you in focus to battle aging. Perhaps an off-shoot of genetics 
<br>
study which attempts to treat progeria? A academic scholar is always hunting 
<br>
for a juicy research grant. Private sector researchers hunt for results. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In the end, I would say that the basis for the singularity is Moore's law, 
<br>
for it allows not only faster computers but also developments in DNA 
<br>
sequencing and a host of other possibilities. Yet I'm sure there are 
<br>
physical limits for Moore's law. When will we reach them? Can you be sure 
<br>
Moore's law will continue for long enough to develop a smarter-than-man 
<br>
artificial intelligence?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>As a biologist, you may wish to realize there may be no practical limit, at 
<br>
least for 100-200 years, in a &quot;Moore's Law&quot; for DNA-based computing. This may 
<br>
be were Super Intelligent-Artifical Intelligence will arise-not in mere 
<br>
silicon. As author, Stuart Kauffman noted, its all about complexity. His 
<br>
example was, that there are 10^80 number of particles, estimated in the 
<br>
visible Universe. But that for all molecular chains of proteins, on Earth, 
<br>
that extend out to 3 sequences, or more; its 10^1300.
<br>
Again, the complexity of electrons flowing one hundred ways, simultaneously, 
<br>
through DNA goop, may be much better than ballistic electrons through 
<br>
silicon.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;When I found transhumanism, already several years ago, I thought it set an 
<br>
optimistic but plausible scenario. Now, I'm starting to wonder if we're not 
<br>
just another cult willing to sacrifice reality towards a fairer image of 
<br>
the world. Please prove me wrong. Or does anyone here thinks we're 
<br>
descendant from aliens?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The plausibility is still there, but nobody ever said it was easy. In the 
<br>
field if materials science, nanotechnology seems to be keeping its pace, as 
<br>
far as innovative research is occurring. I also suspect that nobody on this 
<br>
list is putting all their efforts in flying saucer development, or have 
<br>
mortaged their homes to pay for &quot;uploads&quot; yet.
<br>
<p>As far as &quot;sacrificing reality for a fairer image of the world&quot; I say, you 
<br>
have to start somewhere. Also, keep in mind, what Gerard K. Oneil once noted: 
<br>
&quot;Scientists tend to overestimate the Impacts of scientific breakthroughs, and 
<br>
underestimate the Impacts of straight-forward extentions of the sciences we 
<br>
are already familiar with.&quot;
<br>
<p>Or to take a note from Vladimir Illyitch Lenin: &quot;Probe with a bayonet, if you 
<br>
find steel, withdraw, if you find mush, dig in!!&quot; Science is an opportunistic 
<br>
endevour, no less then any other human endevour, no less then nature. Find 
<br>
the the mush and dig in.
<br>
<p>Yours, in Cthulu
<br>
<p>Mitch
