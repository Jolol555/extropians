<em>&gt; So, I ask the question I've been asking in one form or another on this forum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over and over for years, but never as concisely as now:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do we do?
</em><br>
<p>[Complex answer. Short form: extend the current narrative by 
<br>
professionalising transhumanism]
<br>
<p>You mention <a href="http://www.hf.caltech.edu/hf/b3/scenarios/">http://www.hf.caltech.edu/hf/b3/scenarios/</a>, and I think it 
<br>
is a good example of what we have to do. If you examine the scenarios it 
<br>
is very obvious (to us) that they totally ignore the possibilities so 
<br>
dear to us. Instead these scenarios are variants of the standard futures 
<br>
people usually think of (you will find variants of these scenarios again 
<br>
and again in the future studies literature) - people are very much 
<br>
trapped in a standard narrative of what the possibilities are (things go 
<br>
on as usual, we revert to barbarism or we end up with a world state) and 
<br>
cannot see things outside it. A bit like when Herman Kahn outlined 
<br>
different future world systems in 1970, and completely missed the 
<br>
possibility of Soviet imploding. That was simply not part of the range 
<br>
of thinkable things. 
<br>
<p>[ We should also be aware that we are ourselves often trapped in a
<br>
narrative of our own. On Transvision 2000 I had a mini-lecture about my
<br>
distrust of the &quot;railway to the future&quot; standard view of the future
<br>
among transhumanists. We have plenty of things that are unthinkable to
<br>
us, but thanks to the existence of another, dominant future paradigm we
<br>
are at least often reminded of many things that we would otherwise have 
<br>
ignored, like to justify the ethics and practicality of the 
<br>
transformations we believe in. ]
<br>
<p>Now, scenarios like the above are powerful because they make people form
<br>
images of different futures and can energize them into acting to make
<br>
them real or avoid the truly bad ones. Never underestimate the power of
<br>
a great story. That is why _Limits to Growth_ has been so influential,
<br>
despite lousy science and predictive power. If new scenarios of the 
<br>
future can be made part of the range of the conceivable, they can also 
<br>
be discussed, analysed and promoted/rejected. 
<br>
<p>As long as transhumanism is inconceivable it has no chance. So we have
<br>
to make it part of the big narratives. This is where my standard
<br>
arguments (you have all heard them before) about writing, writing,
<br>
writing for the meme-carriers come in. Describe you views - in fiction,
<br>
as engineering sketches, as simple essays, as books, as corporate
<br>
reports, scenarios, as artworks, as political speeches, as academic
<br>
papers, conference proceedings - and make sure they end up published. If
<br>
people hate them, great, then you can get into a debate with them about
<br>
why they are good or bad (one way of getting published with an
<br>
unconventional view is actually to criticize one current position or
<br>
view from your perspective - it acts as a hook to get you published and
<br>
part of the debate). If people love them, continue by discussing the
<br>
next steps of making things real. Concentrate on getting these ideas
<br>
conceivable to the people that work with ideas and communication; they
<br>
will both spread them further and be influential critics/helpers. 
<br>
<p>Right now we are in no position to make laws, influence policy or fund
<br>
research. But that will change as soon as these ideas become relevant
<br>
and are taken up by new mainstream groups.  We might very well end up
<br>
with our current institutions and networks supplanted by new &gt;H
<br>
institutions, something we personally might find disagreeable if we are
<br>
not early adapters and efficient risers (it happened with internet and
<br>
nanotechnology). But if these new institutions embody our ideas, we
<br>
should be happy. Transhumanism in suit works. 
<br>
<p>On the really practical level, we have to find better ways of 
<br>
communicating. I think part of it is the professionalisation of 
<br>
transhumanism. Instead of having it as a hobby, we should make it our 
<br>
job. It is great earning money and influence from doing what you like. 
<br>
So the issue for each of us is how to either integrate transhumanism 
<br>
into current jobs, or how to create jobs for ourselves that promote 
<br>
transhumanism. It can range from being an academic over think tanks to 
<br>
physical training.
