Terry W. Colvin, quoting the article bt Laurie Garrett:
<br>
&lt;&lt;- If the U.S. unilaterally goes to war, and it is anything short of a
<br>
quick surgical strike (lasting less than 30 days), the economists were all
<br>
predicting extreme economic gloom: falling dollar value, rising spot
<br>
market oil prices, the Fed pushing interest rates down towards zero with
<br>
resulting increase in national debt, severe trouble in all countries whose
<br>
currency is guaranteed agains the dollar (which is just about everybody
<br>
except the EU), a near cessation of all development and humanitarian
<br>
programs for poor countries. Very few economists or ministers of finance
<br>
predicted the world getting out of that economic funk for minimally
<br>
five-10 years, once the downward spiral ensues.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I suspect that the economic growth by most of the European nations have been 
<br>
rather lackluster, over the last several years, as has been Japan's anemic 
<br>
low growth economy. Do these masters of their respective central banks have a 
<br>
track record of producing new jobs in Europe? I believe the answer is to the 
<br>
contrary. Are they not reflecting the current European tendency to favor 
<br>
entitlements over growth?
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;- Not surprisingly, the business community was in no mood to hear about a
<br>
war in Iraq. Except for diehard American Republicans, a few Brit Tories
<br>
and some Middle East folks the WEF was in a foul, angry anti-American
<br>
mood. Last year the WEF was a lovefest for America. This year the mood was
<br>
so ugly that it reminded me of what it felt like to be an American
<br>
overseas in the Reagan years. The rich -- whether they are French or
<br>
Chinese or just about anybody -- are livid about the Iraq crisis primarily
<br>
because they believe it will sink their financial fortunes.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>These people are, as Charles Krauthammer stated, &quot;Ok with Saddam having WMD, 
<br>
and doing business with him.&quot; I would further add (polemicist that I am) that 
<br>
most of this elite, and the not-so-elites; don't give a fart what happended 
<br>
on 9-11, and what would happen if and when Iraq, or North Korea, or Iran 
<br>
decide to send to nastiness to the US. The statement last year, by Chirac, 
<br>
about us &quot;Now being all Americans&quot; was merely a political puffery. We should 
<br>
take gratuitious statements such as that, as no more important than their 
<br>
criticisms. &gt;:-)
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;- US unilateralism is seen as arrogant, bullyish. If the U.S. cannot
<br>
behave in partnership with its allies -- especially the Europeans -- it
<br>
risks not only political alliance but BUSINESS, as well...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Poor babies. Its a war over oil, especially if one is part of the EU elite. 
<br>
40 billion worth and counting on the French side.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;I learned that the US economy is the primary drag on the global economy,
<br>
and only a handful of nations have sufficient internal growth to thrive
<br>
when the US is stagnating&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>And Americans made their cows give sour milk!
