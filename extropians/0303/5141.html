<p><em>&gt; Lee, why don't you write a book?  Call it 'Ascension to Godhood'. Early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothetical conjectures about the nature of man and the universe would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to illuminating analysis of folks who think different than you, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; followed by the condemnation of everything not-you.  Then, standing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outside of time and space, you conclude with a series of transcendental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aphorisms that prove (by your own logic) that your Ascension is complete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd buy it (after it comes out in paperback, at a used book sale).
</em><br>
<p>Having ended your post with these words, well, I *hope* that
<br>
I can take literally all that you write that comes before.
<br>
(Except one or two places of understandable and not-bad-at-
<br>
all sarcasm ;-)

</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I admire your logic.  Though opposed to the war, you don't
<br>
have any problem with a quick American victory.  However,
<br>
you seem to think that this is an easily acquired viewpoint
<br>
for all those who were opposed (often viscerally).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I conjecture your conjectured reaction is nowhere near 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable in the majority of those opposed to this war.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sorry that my choice of vocabulary is derailing your
<br>
exposition.  That word, by the way, is foundational in
<br>
evolutionary epistemology, and makes me wonder if you've
<br>
ever read any PCR (see the Extropian site).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I have no doubts that on this forum a few people do achieve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the desirable state that lies between normal human functioning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the one hand and hyper-rationality on the other, that is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On this point I have no doubt whatsoever that you can think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of at least one.
</em><br>
<p>Here, I don't know whether to think that you mean yourself,
<br>
which does logically flow from what you have written before,
<br>
or if this is a snide insult where your urge to attack 
<br>
my personality has superseded your rational abilities
<br>
after all.  Would you clarify if you meant you or me?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't really see any difference between American U.S. war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; protesters---after hostilities have actually begun---and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; traitors. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, people who dare to exercise their first amendment rights are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'traitors'.
</em><br>
<p>What if the war had been declared?  Then, *literally*, they
<br>
would be traitors.  Do you have a problem with that?  Do you
<br>
know what the word actually means?  It means to work against
<br>
one's own country in time of war.  By definition, it is one
<br>
who commits treason.  Treason is defined as
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Violation of allegiance toward one's country or
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sovereign, especially the betrayal of one's country
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by waging war against it or by consciously and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;purposely acting to aid its enemies. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. A betrayal of trust or confidence. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally, I would consider persons who spit on the constitution,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the document our soldiers and leaders are sworn to uphold, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be 'traitors'.
</em><br>
<p>It shows that you're overreacting a little---you really mean
<br>
those who disagree with your interpretation of the constitution.
<br>
Moreover, your usage is at odds with the conventional usage as
<br>
given above.
<br>
<p>I have known many people of the far left for many, many decades.
<br>
They're not cowards, and are often passionately and ideologically
<br>
dedicated to their causes.  I could easily name ten or fifteen
<br>
who wouldn't be fazed in the slightest by an American declaration
<br>
of war against Iraq, but would continue their anti-U.S. position
<br>
tirades just as before.  The definition provided above covers
<br>
exactly what they would be doing.
<br>
<p>Well, I consider them to be doing that *now*.  Their nation
<br>
*is* involved in a war since last week, yet they work to do
<br>
everything they can to undermine its position, and, unlike
<br>
you, hope against hope that somehow their nation is defeated.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S. I realize that you aren't an American, Mike, and that those
<br>
words of course can't apply to you in any case.
