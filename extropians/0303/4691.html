</em><br>
<p>I'll take issue with a couple of points here -- the &quot;true menace&quot; is
<br>
not the nuclear weapons.  Sure the landing of 100+ ICBMs would ruin
<br>
the U.S. but the odds of that are pretty darn low compared with the
<br>
possibility of even a single nuclear weapon being blown up by terrorists
<br>
in NY or L.A. harbor.  But those events while certainly horrible will
<br>
not &quot;destroy&quot; the U.S.
<br>
<p>Many of the weapons in Russia *are* being disassembled -- it would be
<br>
interesting to have a real &quot;factual&quot; discussion as to what extent they
<br>
are being stored vs. disassembled.  But even if they are being disassembled
<br>
you still have the problem of *what* to do with the nuclear material.
<br>
The best numbers I've got suggest that Russia has 1050 tons of highly
<br>
enriched uranium and 160 tons of plutonium.  Note those figures are *TONS*!
<br>
Given an average of 15 kg of HEU and 3.2 kg of Pu/warhead that translates
<br>
to enough material for ~120,000 weapons (the U.S. isn't far behind with
<br>
enough material for ~75,000 weapons).
<br>
<p>Even if you &quot;disassemble&quot; the warheads -- the material will still be
<br>
around for clever terrorists to smuggle out of Russia -- either for
<br>
the purposes of creating dirty bombs or real atomic weapons.
<br>
<p>The fellow who made up the saying &quot;May you live in interesting times&quot;
<br>
didn't know the half of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will this scupper Bush's &quot;gentleman's agreement&quot; to increase the number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of stored nuclear weapons?
</em><br>
<p>I think the U.S. is paying Russia to gradually disassemble the weapons
<br>
but that still doesn't solve the long term problem of what to do with
<br>
the fissile material they contain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will Russia, unable to equal America technologically, return to power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through simple hydrogen bombs?
</em><br>
<p>They know they have more fissile material than we do.  They also know
<br>
that their rockets may be a bit more reliable at this point.  I don't
<br>
think they feel it necessary to restart the cold war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Will China suddenly be happy with North Korea having the bomb?
</em><br>
<p>Well, N.K. probably has the bomb, and certainly has missiles that
<br>
can deliver them to parts of China.  The question is what will
<br>
China's response be to N.K. having lots of bombs?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pushing around a small country that doesn't threaten you, just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate how big you are, and in the face of opposition from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal largest military force in the world (Russia), can only be a dumb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thing.
</em><br>
<p>I don't notice Russia rushing to defend the actions of N.K.  China is
<br>
also sitting on the fence.  At some point both are going to need to decide
<br>
whether they are dealing with a reliable nation or one being run by
<br>
a fruitcake.
<br>
