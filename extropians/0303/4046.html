<p><em>&gt; I would certainly be interested to hear what extropians think of Patents (at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least, mechanical innovation patents)
</em><br>
<p>Coming from the IT/software/Open Source side of things, I am extremely
<br>
skeptical of patents.  The patent system seems to reflect a 19th
<br>
century outlook on a mostly static, mechanical world which is wildy
<br>
at odds with a fast moving 21st century world increasingly dominated
<br>
by software and information.
<br>
<p>One of the basic themes on this list is progress and in fact the
<br>
accelerating speed of progress.  If you measure the subjective time
<br>
of a patent grant not in years but by the amount of change taking
<br>
place in the meantime, then the current fixed n-year objective
<br>
lifetime means that patents are running for an ever increasing
<br>
subjective time.  Back in the 1800s, a time to market of a decade
<br>
may have been realistic.  Nowadays, a company may not even remember
<br>
its products of a decade ago.  Current patent lifetimes of ~20 years
<br>
are an eternity.
<br>
<p>A patent protects against a competitor simply stealing the inventor's
<br>
blueprints and outproducing him.  (There are also more specific
<br>
laws against the theft of business secrets, which I'll ignore here
<br>
for the sake of argument.)  I think most of us consider that a good
<br>
thing.
<br>
<p>A patent also protects against a competitor seeing an invention and
<br>
reproducing it more or less independently.  Once you know that
<br>
something can be done, figuring out how to is usually less difficult.
<br>
I think the virtue of this sort of protection is not so clearcut,
<br>
since we are not talking about blind imitation but about people
<br>
being partly creative in their own right.
<br>
<p>A patent also protects against a competitor coming up with the same
<br>
thing entirely independently without ever having heard of the
<br>
original invention.  It effectively screws out the second inventor
<br>
of his investment.  And as progress keeps accelerating, such parallel
<br>
development becomes more and more common.  I think this type of
<br>
protection is objectionable.  Of course, in practice, it may be
<br>
impossible to prove whether a design was imitated or arrived at
<br>
independently.
<br>
<p>Nominally, a patent protects a single invention.  This may have
<br>
been true in the steam age, when some tinkerer invented a great,
<br>
fuming foobazler.  Nowadays you have to consider that the patent
<br>
protection effectively also reaches out to anything that is based
<br>
on a foobazler or includes a foobazler somewhere as a small part.
<br>
A patent removes a whole path of development from that available
<br>
to the competition.  Again, this wasn't such a big issue when
<br>
progress was slow, but with the current and accelerating turnover
<br>
of technology this is an ever growing obstacle to further progress
<br>
in the direction covered by the patent.  Obviously this is even
<br>
worse for broad or generic patents that cover methods of doing
<br>
things rather than actual devices.
<br>
<p>If you talk to some crypto people, they will tell you that the RSA
<br>
patent was rather more successful in preventing widespread adoption
<br>
of cryptography than US export regulations.  You may also have heard
<br>
of talk in Green circles of acquiring patents with the express
<br>
purpose of obstructing biotech research.
<br>
<p>Patents have become a part of business, but in ways that do not
<br>
deal with protecting the inventor's investment.  There are so many
<br>
patents that have been granted that it is virtually impossible for
<br>
engineers to check whether their product violates any of them.
<br>
Corporations recognize this and try to build comprehensive patent
<br>
portfolios for offensive and defensive action.  That competitor
<br>
there cuts into your market?  Sue him for patent infringement.
<br>
Simply by being in the same market segment he is bound to accidentally
<br>
run into your patents.  Somebody sues you for patent infringement?
<br>
Countersue them, they're likely to violate some of your own patents.
<br>
Big companies, who hold numerous patents, have little to fear.  With
<br>
their fat portfolios they negotiate cross-licensing contracts with
<br>
the other big players.  For small companies, upstarts, the much
<br>
touted garage inventors, the perspective is very grim.  Patents
<br>
that cover only part of a complex product or are so old that people
<br>
already consider the idea as common knowledge can be used as a
<br>
weapon to suppress competition.
<br>
<p>A favorite are submarine patents.  Take out a patent on an invention
<br>
that lies in the mainstream of technical development.  Don't develop
<br>
any product, just sit back and wait some years.  By now the market
<br>
is full of products that, unbeknownst by their creators, infringe
<br>
on your patent.  Even better if it has become part of some standard.
<br>
Have your lawyers write threatening letters and watch the royalties
<br>
rolling in.  This looks like a perversion of the ideas behind the
<br>
patent system, but it is neverless sanctioned by it.
<br>
<p>Then there is reasonable licensing.  In theory, a patent holder is
<br>
obliged to license his invention to competitors at a reasonable
<br>
fee.  In practice, it is not clear what a reasonable fee constitutes.
<br>
And I wish you good luck enforcing this of a patent holder who
<br>
simply doesn't want to grant any licenses.  In the times when an
<br>
invention equalled a product, this was of little concern.  But
<br>
nowadays an invention may affect thousands of products and a patent
<br>
may keep them from coming into existence.
<br>
<p>As an Open Source person, &quot;reasonable licensing&quot; translates to
<br>
prohibition for me.  Since I don't charge anything, there is no way
<br>
I could recoup even a minimal license fee.  Patents assume that
<br>
every invention and use of an invention takes places in the setting
<br>
of a for-profit business.  The patent system punishes the Open
<br>
Source world for stepping outside of this traditional setting.  A
<br>
patent effectively removes an invention from the Open Source economy.
<br>
In the Open Source setting, each patent destroys a piece of (potential)
<br>
progress and the path behind it.  In this context, patents are
<br>
unmitigated evil.
<br>
<p>In short:  Although I can understand the moviation behind the patent
<br>
system, I consider it at best as of dubious value and ill-adapted
<br>
to the times.
<br>
<p>Like other posters in this thread I come from a particular background
<br>
that necessarily influences my views.  For example, I have no idea
<br>
whatsoever how the pharmaceutical industry operates and I can't
<br>
judge the value of the patent system in that context.  In the
<br>
computer industry, patents help the biggest players to establish a
<br>
chokehold on everybody else and kill diversity and progress.
