I think that Video is a much better medium than Writing. It will have huge 
<br>
impacts on the general public when anyone can make and distribute them. If a 
<br>
book could be completely changed, without leaving anything out, into video 
<br>
it would be a much better source. Our minds will change and adventually 
<br>
learn to accept information in video form as well as we do in writin form.
<br>
<p>The alphabet is Primitive. Only 26 letters for english. It's time to move 
<br>
on.
<br>
<p>What is a faster way is there than video besides direct download? Lets be 
<br>
the most transhuman and use video when it becomes available.
<br>
I encourage all authors to make dvd's equivalents to thier books when it 
<br>
becomes affordable. I hope that email lists and it's participants upgrade 
<br>
for video compatibilities.
<br>
<p>Why are we spending so much time predicting the far future. This is the time 
<br>
in which progress will be made. I think the time for transhuman ideas to 
<br>
gain ground is now. We should sway opinion before technology clashes with 
<br>
ideology. I believe the next step is making videos that ordinary people will 
<br>
watch and learn. Especially if we can provide them at the minimum costs or 
<br>
even free. Maybe even get goverment grants.
<br>
<p>How much money will it take to put a dvd in every adults hands. How much 
<br>
money for just the scientific community. It's almost time for any individual 
<br>
to be able to get into the propaganda game.
