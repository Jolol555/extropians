<p>Los Angeles Times: Stone Ax Hints at First Stirring of Compassion
<br>
Prehistoric rock found among human remains is said to testify to the origins
<br>
of burial rites.
<br>
By Robert Lee Hotz, Times Staff Writer
<br>
<p>NEW YORK -- To the primitive hands that deftly shaped it from rose-colored
<br>
quartz 350,000 years ago, a glittering stone ax may have been as dazzling as
<br>
any ceremonial saber.
<br>
It was found in the depths of a Spanish cavern among the skeletal remains of
<br>
27 primitive men, women and children -- pristine, solitary and placed like a
<br>
lasting tribute to the deceased whose bones embraced it. For the
<br>
archeologists who unearthed this prehistoric blade, the unique burial site
<br>
is a compelling but controversial glimpse of arguably the earliest evidence
<br>
of humanity's dawning spiritual life. The ax may be a token of the first
<br>
known funeral. If so, the find is 250,000 years older than any other
<br>
evidence that such early human species honored their dead, said experts led
<br>
by Eudald Carbonell at Universitat Rovira i Virgili in Tarragona, Spain, and
<br>
the Museum of Natural History in Madrid. The researchers believe that the ax
<br>
-- perhaps the earliest offering to the dead -- testifies to what skulls and
<br>
bones alone cannot: the origins of spirituality and ritual. In their view,
<br>
this mute rock embodies compassion, grief and a desire to commemorate the
<br>
dead among creatures until now considered incapable of modern human
<br>
behavior. &quot;This would mean that human cognitive complexity emerged on the
<br>
planet much earlier than previously thought,&quot; Carbonell said. Exploring the
<br>
origins of the mind is a risky research endeavor under any circumstances. It
<br>
can be all but impossible to distinguish hard evidence of something as
<br>
fleeting as thought, especially from the distance of so many thousands of
<br>
years.
<br>
But if the research team's claim is borne out, the ax marks a crucial
<br>
milestone in the archeology of the mind.
