</em><br>
<p>Ja, after rereading what I posted I recognize that it
<br>
was indeed far too cynical.  Criticism accepted,
<br>
Samantha, comments on charity retracted.
<br>
<p>There have been justified criticisms of certain charitable
<br>
efforts that have gone wrong.  The classic example
<br>
was from a few years ago when the US received a number
<br>
of videos of starving African babies, raised a ton of
<br>
money, sent bottles and formula to Africa, the young
<br>
mothers fed their babies with that stuff until it ran out,
<br>
at which time the mothers had ceased lactating and then
<br>
the babies starved.  The action ended up slaying far more
<br>
than would have perished by natural means, more than would
<br>
have died had the charities done nothing.  This is tragic
<br>
as all hell, but there were no capitalist plots involved
<br>
or any mindless bungling really.  It was an outpouring
<br>
of generosity that went terribly wrong.  The charity
<br>
did create a dependency, but it was not intentional or
<br>
malicious.  The baby formula factory was not to blame,
<br>
for they received and order and they filled it.
<br>
<p>One good example of malicious judicial contribution
<br>
would be when RJReynolds Co donated tons of tobacco to
<br>
the soldiers in WW2.  Millions of dollars given, or
<br>
invested, depending on how one looks at it.  They had
<br>
to know the stuff was addictive.  I'll allow them the
<br>
benefit of the doubt as to their knowledge in those
<br>
days of the harmfulness of their product.
<br>
<p>We currently face the same dilemma with the introduction
<br>
of GM crops, which would certainly go a long way to
<br>
improve the food situation.  Like the baby formula
<br>
situation, of course, it poses a dilemma, for as soon
<br>
as GM crops are established, a dependency upon them is
<br>
created.
<br>
<p>I have been personally acquainted with a number of
<br>
missionary families.  My brother in law answered the
<br>
call to missions as well.  In every case, their motives
<br>
were pure, even tho the outcome had mixed results.  In
<br>
any case, no person and no nation should ever be criticized
<br>
for generosity and benevolence, even if it doesn't work
<br>
as intended.
