<p><em>&gt; See my other post on this point. We need to increase funding by managing,

<em>&gt; growing and presenting demand for improvements in real anti-aging medicine.
</em><br>
<p>Some of us, esp. David Kekich and Aubrey de Grey are trying to
<br>
do this (each based on their own expertise, David with TransVio
<br>
and Aubrey with his structuring of the fall IABG conference).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Realistically, assuming that the US and more governments manage not to shut
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down all avenues of anti-aging research, we're looking at minor anti-aging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; medical technologies becoming available in ten years,
</em><br>
<p>The US will not shut it down.  I've just recently had a long conversation
<br>
with Natasha about how to prioritize ExI efforts.  Unknown to most people
<br>
is the fact that China is going &quot;over the edge&quot; with regard to cloning research.
<br>
This was documented in a recent Nature article and I've had personal confirmations.
<br>
(We are talking more money than the principle investigators know how to effectively
<br>
spend...).  The reasoning is simple.  China has an aging population, the
<br>
elderly are very respected in Chinese culture (perhaps Taoist tradition??)
<br>
and so they should be cared for, *but* the Chinese &quot;one child&quot; policy for
<br>
many decades means there are too few children to care for the infirmed
<br>
elderly.  The only solution for China is to find a way to make sure that
<br>
the elderly do not become &quot;infirmed&quot;.  Thus a flood of money into stem cell
<br>
research.
<br>
<p>As I have made the argument that GM crops cannot be stopped -- anti-aging
<br>
research cannot be stopped as well.  As Spock so well observed in
<br>
Star Trek II: &quot;The needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few... or
<br>
the one&quot;.  The &quot;deathist&quot; bioethicists will fail.
<br>
<p>My conclusion (and suggestion to Natasha) is that ExI should not focus
<br>
too much energy on dealing with anti-stem-cell/cloning efforts.  It
<br>
is a question of inertia -- opinions in the U.S. or Europe are only
<br>
going to have a limited impact on global inertia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is conditional on us winning the war of memes with the deathist bioethicists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they convince the world that no-one should have anti-aging technology, that it's immoral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and unimportant, that it will be legislated against, then the markets will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never come into being. The research will never happen.
</em><br>
<p>Highly unlikely to happen.  I'll cite everything from personal self-interest
<br>
(the Ellison Medical Foundation) to the cultural self-interest (see China
<br>
above).  We can be very annoyed with any deathists but they aren't going
<br>
to win in the long run (they would have to eliminate our instincts for
<br>
survival).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I see the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as being a lack of funding, rather than a failing of human nature.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed!  I would only make a slight modification that one of the
<br>
major reasons for the lack of funding is that most people think
<br>
the problems cannot be solved -- we didn't go to the moon until
<br>
we went to the moon.  In many respects what is lacking is someone
<br>
saying &quot;let us go to the moon&quot;.  Aging may be somewhat more complex
<br>
than going to the moon but it isn't *that* much more complex.
<br>
