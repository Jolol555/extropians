<p><em>&gt; In the paper, the decision is just one-shot, without this dynamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback process. Everyone is assumed to already know the average M
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the whole things starts. One might ask what's the purpose of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mechanism then, if everyone already knows the outcome? Apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the implicit assumption is that everyone knows except the government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the government needs this mechanism to find out the answer. If my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation is correct, this seems to make the Groves-Ledyard mechanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useless in real world situations, where the real average M is unknown,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because people would be taxed less on how much their preferences differ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the average, and more on their ability to guess the correct average.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This seems to be rather unjust and unlikely to be widely adopted. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also means that you can't just ignore the public goods that you're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in. You have to become an expert in every one so that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can guess the correct average preference.
</em><br>
<p>That bit about everyone setting their M values at once was my invention
<br>
to try to make concrete the idea of people choosing their M values while
<br>
knowing what everyone else's was.  Maybe a better way to accomplish it
<br>
would be to think of repeating the funding process on a regular basis,
<br>
say every day, where you are funding just one day's worth of public goods.
<br>
Then the values would not change much from day to day and you'd have
<br>
a good idea of what to expect.  One paper I looked at which tried a
<br>
lab experiment on the GL process did it that way (although with only
<br>
5 participants).
<br>
<p>Generally the GL analysis assumes that there are enough people that no one
<br>
person can influence the prices.  This is in keeping with the flavor of
<br>
&quot;neo-classical&quot; economic analysis of private markets.  People are assumed
<br>
to be &quot;price takers&quot;, meaning that we accept prices as given and don't
<br>
expect our decisions to alter prices except to an infinitisimal degree.
<br>
That's how most of our shopping is done, and it is the same kind of
<br>
assumption being used in the GL government.
<br>
<p>Setting M values is analogous to setting prices in a private market.
<br>
It is generally assumed you know what other people are asking and
<br>
offering when you make your own bids.  This seemingly leads to an infinite
<br>
recurrence, where no one can bid until they know what others are bidding,
<br>
but in practice it is resolved easily.  I think the same thing can be
<br>
true of the GL mechanism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In your dynamic scheme, things don't quite work because everyone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an incentive to lie until right before the end. Suppose you have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater than average preference for the public good. You would want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turn your dial as high as possible to create the impression that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average preference is higher than it really is. This gives an incentive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to everyone else to turn their dials higher (closer to the average) to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reduce the &quot;non-conformity tax&quot;. You can then switch back to a lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setting one second before the vote ends. If everyone knows this, of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course, they'll just disregard any display of the current average and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this scheme becomes equivalent to the original one-shot scheme.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this works if we assume that no one person can wield that
<br>
much influence.  Consider a similar strategy in the private market: I
<br>
will hold off on doing my Christmas shopping until the last day, in the
<br>
hopes that sellers will drive their prices down due to the lack of my
<br>
contribution to demand, then I will step in at the last minute and take
<br>
advantage of the low prices.  Well, this strategy doesn't work because one
<br>
person's demand doesn't influence prices measurably.  In the same way, my
<br>
twiddling my knob will not appreciably influence other people's settings.
<br>
<p>AS GL write (page 807): &quot;Just as in a finite agent Arrow-Debreu
<br>
economy [i.e. a private-goods economy] a sophisticated consumer can
<br>
gain by considering how prices and his profit shares are affected
<br>
by his own demand; in our public goods model, under our mechanism, a
<br>
sophisticated consumer can gain by considering how equilibrium prices,
<br>
his profit shares, and the other consumers' messages are affected by
<br>
his own decisions.&quot;  Earlier on that page they write: &quot;our competitive
<br>
assumptions imply Nash equilibrium decisions are chosen.&quot;  They are
<br>
rejecting more elaborate game theory strategies such as you propose
<br>
and focussing on Nash equilibria.  In the context of a large market and
<br>
competitive (i.e. non-cooperative, non-colluding) behavior, that is a
<br>
reasonable assumption.
