<p>OK I had an idea today.  The current system allows one
<br>
to log into the archives and either applaud or smite
<br>
a particular post, at which time the karma counts the
<br>
numbers of each and assigns the result to the poster.
<br>
<p>In the case of the extro archives it is pretty clear to
<br>
me that the database has been somehow corrupted or perhaps
<br>
hit by a repetitive smitebot, or a malicious sultan of smite
<br>
with enough time and patience to repeatedly open a post and
<br>
smite beyond recogition.  Evidence: Greg Burch had only a
<br>
very few posts this calendar year, each of which I opened and
<br>
studied looking for any smitable content, yet there was none
<br>
that I could detect.  Inappropriate smition still occurred,
<br>
and I am not just saying that because I failed to achieve
<br>
the height of smite, or even because I like the sound of
<br>
the term smite, as well as smiteth, and smitten, which is
<br>
what Bambi was with Fayleen, you will recall.
<br>
<p>A random sampling shows that most posters actually have
<br>
negative karma, however when we were at Extros 4 and 5,
<br>
I do not recall seeing groups sitting around smiting each
<br>
other.  Altho that does conjure entertaining mental imagery,
<br>
and may have been worth the cost of admission just to see it,
<br>
ours is not that kind of group.  Quite the opposite, the
<br>
extropians appear to hold each other in quite high regard.
<br>
<p>Idea: instead of a poster being smote, we set the buttons to
<br>
refer to the subject and the post.  Instead of the violent
<br>
&quot;smite&quot; terminology, we use snore and pop, indicating popping
<br>
to attention at an exciting post, or snoring at subject which
<br>
one finds boring, stupid, unwell thought out, nonextropian,
<br>
etc.  This might encourage those gentle souls who would never
<br>
smite another person to express their interest level, which
<br>
could be a far more valuable tool for increasing signal to
<br>
noise ratio on the extrolist.  Then instead of a karma index,
<br>
the script would tally by subject line, the snore/pop ratio.
<br>
<p>This technique would indicate what things extropians really
<br>
are interested in and what they like to talk about, without
<br>
running the risk of coercing anyone to modify their behavior.
<br>
We could continue to behave in accordance with Crocker's Rules.
<br>
I would far prefer an extrolist that is interesting to one
<br>
that is nice.  Nice is for motorcycle lists.
<br>
<p>Notice that the pop signal need not mean one *agrees* with
<br>
the post.   If we have beaten a topic beyond recognition,
<br>
such as the gun thread, we could simply snore it to death.
<br>
<p>Suggested symbols for snore =z, pop = !
<br>
<p>Whuffie could even be estimated indirectly, by seeing who
<br>
originates the most snorey threads, vs who originates the
<br>
poppy topics.  The potential for word play alone would make
<br>
it worth the effort.  People who often post interesting but
<br>
negatively provocative topics would be popscalions.  A
<br>
person who pops everything would be a popperdemalion, their
<br>
counterparts, stormin' snoremen.  Those who hammer out
<br>
boring stuff, snoremiesters.  Their posts would be
<br>
snorejerkers, but the extrocons would be waaay pop city.
