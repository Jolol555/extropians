<p><em>&gt; I like FoxNews the best, and find that in the &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; realm;
</em><br>
Fox/Republicans are
<br>
<em>&gt; spot-on. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, the FOX/Republicans are most definitely spot-on *if you want the
<br>
GOP point of view*. You can't do any better than FOX's analyst Newt
<br>
Gingrich! Gingrich is no longer in politics but he's still a major god of
<br>
the party.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Spot-off is CNN, and typically the least pro-American of the &quot;news
</em><br>
channels.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I won't disagree that CNN is &quot;typically the least pro-American of the news
<br>
channels.&quot; However I don't personally want my international news to be
<br>
&quot;pro-American&quot; in the first place. I want to see the news from the point of
<br>
view (POV) of all human-kind. Ideally I would like to see the news from the
<br>
POV of a hypothetical Martian who comes to Earth and reports earthly events
<br>
to his fellow Martians. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; MsNBC is rather good, in that it seems incisive; biting in the way Fox is,
</em><br>
but less 
<br>
<em>&gt; personality-dependent. 
</em><br>
<p>That could be true. I don't personally watch MSNBC. My only experience with
<br>
it is from links at the msn.com homepage on the net, which I do visit every
<br>
day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For news analysis (tell me what to think!!!) I enjoy the National Review,
</em><br>
Weekly Standard,
<br>
<em>&gt; occasionally, The New Republic and the like.
</em><br>
<p>I was a subscriber to the National Review for a long time, and still read it
<br>
when I have the opportunity. I have a great deal of respect for William F.
<br>
Buckley. He seems to understand the important distinction between freedom
<br>
politics and GOP politics. For example he breaks with the GOP in his
<br>
opposition to the War on Drugs. 
<br>
<p>I don't read the other publications you mention, so I can't really comment,
<br>
but I will say that my general impression of them is favorable. 
<br>
<p>By the way, I sent a message a couple of hours ago in which I stated that in
<br>
my opinion FOX News is a news network designed by and for morons. I hope you
<br>
don't think I was referring specifically to you. I just have some pretty
<br>
strong feelings about this subject. I think bias in the media should be
<br>
investigated and exposed.
