<p>I agree the x10 isn't a great solution, but I would
<br>
still urge those who attend a rally to get one and
<br>
hang it somewhere on your clothing, even if it isnt
<br>
doing anything.  The cops don't know what you are
<br>
up to, and if they arrest you with a transmitting cam,
<br>
they dont know who has received the signals, they
<br>
dont know if they managed to apprehend the receiver.
<br>
I suspect the cops and protesters would behave
<br>
themselves much better with this nagging uncertainty.
<br>
<p>Remember that incident from the 60s where the cops water-
<br>
cannoned a civil rights marcher?  That one piece of
<br>
film has been seen by jillions of people, it has been
<br>
shown countless times on TV.  It has likely had more
<br>
impact on civil rights than all the speeches that were
<br>
ever made.  Visual images have enormous impact, they
<br>
have power, everyone understands.  If the cops and the
<br>
protestors all knew that any inappropriate or violent
<br>
misbehavior might be the next great sight bite for
<br>
decades, then civil protests would be so much more
<br>
civil.  Everyone wins this time.
<br>
<p>spike
<br>
<p>ps: Well, almost everyone wins.  If it is a march to
<br>
protest universal transparency, Im not sure how it
<br>
would work in that case.  {8^D
