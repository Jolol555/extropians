<em>&gt; &gt; War is a area that illustrates that much libertarian theory is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; useful when you apply it to an entirely libertarian world (i.e. a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fictional universe, at present). Strict libertarian theory does little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to allow one to rationally or effectively deal with a semi- to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-libertarian world full of many anti-libertarian actors...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is a distinction between libertarians and anarchists.  Most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarians believe that government should exist and take on certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;limited, well-defined functions.  Usually national defense is among them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's a classic public good.  So there's no inconsistency between a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;libertarian society and a strong national defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then there's always the strategy depicted in Vernor Vinge's short story
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The Ungoverned, where individual citizens arm themselves using the kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;advanced weaponry that most governments forbid their citizens to possess.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's not clear whether that would work as well in practice as it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depicted in fiction though.

<p>If I recall...Ah, here's the book...  It seems that in &quot;The Ungoverned&quot; the 
<br>
clear majority of citizen's relied on the private security agencies for all 
<br>
their defense needs.  These agencies had a lot of mutual assistance pacts 
<br>
that allowed them to fight together, though in the book it was shown that 
<br>
this resulted in a delay in their responses.  There were a few people who 
<br>
didn't contract with any security agency and provided their own defense, 
<br>
&quot;armadillos,&quot; but I think not all of these people were so heavily armed.
<br>
<p>Never attribute to malice what can be explained by stupidity.  Don't assign 
<br>
to stupidity what might be due to ignorance.  And try not to assume you 
<br>
opponent is the ignorant one-until you can show it isn't you.
