<em>&gt; &quot;Actually, I think I may have been the one to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; describe the device you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mention.&quot;
</em><br>

<p><em>&gt; &gt; A cheap, simple implant anyone could get. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ideally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it would be even better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if such a device could power external electronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; devices.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;It'd produce miniscule amounts of power - but then,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many devices only need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miniscule amounts of power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, no using yourself as a battery for an electric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car, but you could maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use this to run (or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trickle-recharge, when it's not actively being used)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a PDA.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be nice, at least with later versions, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could alter the rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at which it is processing carbs.  But to start with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a very simple, small
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egg like device is implanted that burns around 100
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Calories per day.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, when I tried writing a biz plan for this
<br>
device, it relied on this generational effect: first
<br>
generation is calorie consumption only; later
<br>
generations add features like generating useful
<br>
amounts of power.  The projected adoption rates for
<br>
the former dominated that for the latter: there are
<br>
many more people who just want to lose weight than
<br>
would (presently) get much utility out of a
<br>
body-powered device.  (Not that there aren't a lot of
<br>
the latter, just that there are far more of the
<br>
former.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;though what energy they do generate would have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be disposed of somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (possibly via an inductive loop, the second part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is placed on or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; near the skin near the implant every day, maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; week, to activate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discharge so as to avoid needing wires or sockets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permanently sticking out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the skin).&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am no electrical engineer, but I think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inductive loop method is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; best way to go as well for tapping any energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; created by the device.  For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starters though, 100 Cals per day isnt much, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average adult male has an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RDA of ~2200 Cal, and disapates all the heat readily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from that.  I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think an additional 100 Cals will make a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference, in fact the body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will probably be able to dissapate that heat quicker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than it is generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the device.  Coupling that with the fact that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bodies normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diffusion processes will remove all the by products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of such a device, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should end up being cheap, simple, and small.
</em><br>
<p>I am an engineer (at least, that's part of my job
<br>
title at the moment), and I did my thesis on devices
<br>
like this.  There have been several studies showing
<br>
that conductive electricity transmission breaks down
<br>
the skin - which effect is being used for some needle
<br>
replacements under development.  But since we don't
<br>
want skin breakdown for this device, inductive is the
<br>
way to go.  (It's also apparently the best way to do
<br>
transmission of control signals and data across the
<br>
skin, as in prosthetics, in addition to sheer power.)
<br>
<p>As to the heat dissapation - yes, it's a small
<br>
fraction of the whole, but remember that this device
<br>
would be an even smaller fraction of the body volume.
<br>
100 calories across the entire body surface is one
<br>
thing; 100 calories across just the belly button is
<br>
quite another.  Still, it might be possible for the
<br>
first generation to get rid of all its energy that
<br>
way; this might be part of the development studies.
<br>
But it might not be desirable to develop that: for
<br>
sheer glucose consumption, getting rid of the energy
<br>
with an implant you can forget about is more
<br>
utilitarian that with an implant you have to wave an
<br>
inductive wand over once every so often.  Which means
<br>
that if we develop towards heat-only disappation, we
<br>
don't have to worry as much about efficiency of
<br>
conversion to electricity, which retards the goal of
<br>
using this device to power other things.  A local
<br>
maximum, as it were.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;It's the biochemical parts that present the biggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenge.  But the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biggest challenge, at least to us, would seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the practical matters of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually doing it.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, but with the various backgrounds on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropy list, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collected intelligence of it, there is no reason it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't be doable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Quite frankly I am surprised it has not generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more interest, here we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a perfect example of an extropian piece of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology, that no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears to be working on, that will likely be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readily accepted by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average Joe, will clearly demonstrate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology can be used to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direclty solve individual humans problems.  Imagine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the press this could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generate for extropian ideals if it brandished the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logo of the EXI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institute.  People would start to realize that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business of using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology to better our lives has some potential. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here they have some real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology that directly makes *my life* better,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *right now*... (I know all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology has a significant impact on our lives,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the average Joe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't think about it or recognize the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electricity or combustion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engines, etc.) 
</em><br>
<p>I was a bit surprised, too.  Especially in the current
<br>
economy, one would think there would be a number of
<br>
people with the relevant skills looking for work -
<br>
and, as I indicated, one could well form a business
<br>
around just this product.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;How would we test it?  (Yes, it's great to say, &quot;in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, one could do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; animal testing&quot;.  Does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any of us have the appropriate equipment or licenses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for this?  If not, how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could we obtain such?)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well thousands of companies do similar things all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the time, so it should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doable.  Besides, those two egregiously overweight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cats that spike posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would probably volunteer if we could explain it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them, if not their owners
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might be volunteer them.  
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it's doable in theory.  The problem is, to
<br>
actually do this we have to go beyond theory into
<br>
practice - and neither you (apparently) nor I
<br>
(definitely) know exactly how to do this.  The problem
<br>
isn't getting the volunteers to test, it's how do we
<br>
construct the device?  I know some of the steps, but
<br>
not enough to do it all myself - at least, not without
<br>
spending a lot of money I don't presently have, and
<br>
I'll need to go quite a bit further than where I am
<br>
now before I could turn to the VCs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Granted, one could start up a business around this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product alone, so that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presents one possible source of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding (VCs).&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think one could as well, and I think it could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite profitable.  I plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pursue it once I finish laying the foundation for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my current venture, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a collected extropy member effort could bring about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a device much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quicker.
</em><br>
<p>If there is anyone else on this list who could, and
<br>
would like to, help turn this device into reality.
