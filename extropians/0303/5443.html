Damien (Caltech!) stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;90% of Spaniards and French oppose the war.  And the Spanish government is 
<br>
one of our allies.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>De-fanging and destroying regimes which play the rogue state-terrorist 
<br>
alliances are emphatically, not a popularity contest. That the descendents of 
<br>
Laval and Petain, in France'; and Franco in Spain find opposition to the 
<br>
undoing of  &quot;their&quot; oil suppliers and commerical customers, bothers me not a 
<br>
fig.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In Germany, of course, Schroeder was elected on anti-war sentiment&gt;&gt;
<br>
Yah! What a royal prize he is, and as for Deutschland, see the above 
<br>
paragraph.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;As for the heavy burdens bit we've been bearing alone, what do you have in
<br>
mind?  The Cold War?  Europe supported us there.  WW II?  We were hardly 
<br>
alone
<br>
in that.  What, really&gt;&gt;
<br>
This can't be right.. The USA, through democratic and republican 
<br>
administrations funded NATO at 85% total cost per year, during the cold war. 
<br>
There were some costs in the maintenance of bases, as far as tanks and 
<br>
airpower, the Euros went lite, and that includes the development of Tornado 
<br>
fighters, Franco-Italian production of Gazelle helicopters. We produced the 
<br>
vast majority of the fighter and cargo aircraft that resided in Nato. The 
<br>
number of European based M-60 series and Abrams tanks far outrank the smaller 
<br>
number of UK Challanger and Chieftain tanks, German Leopards, as well as any F
<br>
rench AMX-30 or 40's that might have been used, had the Soviets penetrated 
<br>
the Fulda Gap. The US was the dog and not the tail as far as cold war funding 
<br>
went.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;We can't even stop prison rape in the US, but we're going to war to stop it
<br>
elsewhere?
<br>
<p>-xx- Damien X-) &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If the President wants to set a moral high tone and &quot;liberate&quot; Iraq, that's 
<br>
ok by me.
<br>
I am far more cynical regarding what we are doing in Iraq, and have less of a 
<br>
high standard for how the United States behaves. I stand for and hope our 
<br>
primary target is; to de-fang rogue regimes like Iraq who delight in using 
<br>
&quot;plausible deniability&quot; by arming &quot;guerilla groups.&quot;
