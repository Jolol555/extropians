</em><br>
<p>Agree about the handiness factor being absent. Of course, that's
<br>
very much what paper and ink booksellers are still in the business
<br>
of selling at a premium (at a profit).
<br>
<p>I got through it in one sitting. I guess I found it accessible--
<br>
or it might have been the novelty spurring me on. I'd say as a work it's on 
<br>
a rough par with John Varley. Would you agree, Hal?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The author, Cory Doctorow, got considerable publicity for making the book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available in this way
</em><br>
....
<br>
<em>&gt; It will be interesting to see how this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book does, as a test case.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I want to rave this up. Tor Books was willing to do this with a smart new 
<br>
author in part because Patrick Nielsen Hayden (Cory Doctorow's editor is 
<br>
what Manny O'Kelly-Davis used to call a not-stupid.
<br>
<p>It's kind of novella-length, and that makes the risk smaller in some ways 
<br>
but limits risks and outlays in others.
<br>
<p>Definitely a prototype.
