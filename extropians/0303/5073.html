Justified is an interesting word.  Perhaps a better term would be &quot;an 
<br>
expected reaction&quot;.  I don't see much on either side that is 
<br>
justifiable, in any absolute sense.  In a more limited sense, 
<br>
self-defense is normally recognized as legitimate.  But as to what 
<br>
should be an expected reaction... here we get back to theft being a 
<br>
hanging offense.  If they see they have nothing to loose, then one 
<br>
should expect them to do all they can, for revenge if not for victory.  
<br>
Once you have killed their children, most people would have few scruples 
<br>
at violating normal ethics to achieve revenge.  It's one of the most 
<br>
powerful motivators that people have.  (In the bible &quot;Vengence is mine, 
<br>
saith the Lord&quot;, particularlly to eliminate it as a legitimate ethical 
<br>
basis for one individual revenging himself on another.)  So you had 
<br>
better expect it if you go in for mass bombing of civilian locations.  
<br>
And we haven't been as scrupulous as we were claiming we would be.  So 
<br>
we had better expect extreme reactions by some reasonable fraction of 
<br>
the populace.
<br>
<p>In short, they've got good reason to hate our guts.  (Thank you, Mr. 
<br>
President.)
