<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.libertarianstudies.org/journals/jls/pdfs/14_1/12hoppe.pdf">http://www.libertarianstudies.org/journals/jls/pdfs/14_1/12hoppe.pdf</a>

<p>I don't see that this really addresses the &quot;free rider&quot; problem at all.
<br>
If my neighborhood is safe against an attack, then essentially I am
<br>
safe too.  Therefore I would prefer to be a free rider and not pay.
<br>
Let my neighbors pay for the defense of the neighborhood.  The result
<br>
is that too little is expended for defense and we all suffer.
<br>
<p>And I think Wei's point is valid, too:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The obvious strategy for a belligerent state interested in taking over an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area protected by insurance companies is to pre-announce an attack a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ahead of time (or whatever period long enough for most insurance policies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to expire).
</em><br>
<p>It's not insurable if there is no uncertainty about the risk.  You can't
<br>
get flood insurance when farms 200 miles upstream are flooded and it's
<br>
known that your farm is going to be under water in a few days.  For the
<br>
same reason, you couldn't get insurance against an attack if the attack
<br>
was guaranteed to happen.
<br>
<p>Now, you could still hire somebody to defend you, or take up arms
<br>
yourself, but it's not &quot;insurance&quot; any more.  It's just an army.
<br>
<p>I also think Hoppe's essay is wrong about a lot of other things, but
<br>
I won't go into them here unless there is more interest.
<br>
<p>Hal
