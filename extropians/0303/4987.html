</em><br>
<p>For this to occur, the force being used to attack a threatened area must be
<br>
far larger than that area could reasonably support (and thus defend against,
<br>
or afford to defend against).
<br>
<p>An insurance/defense company that covered a large area would be wise to
<br>
guarantee the safety of all residents of the area, and to have cooperation
<br>
agreements with other large companies, such that their forces are combined
<br>
to protect any threatened area. Thus the cost spreads over the entirety of
<br>
the insured, and the tactic of threatening only very small areas wont work.
<br>
The insured, for their part, get unconditional blanket protection in their
<br>
agreement, in return for accepting that all other customers do too. Insurers
<br>
would really have to make guarantees such as these, in order to retain the
<br>
confidence of their customers.
<br>
<p>I still don't understand how all the smaller insurers wouldn't get gobbled
<br>
up into a big monopoly, which then has a monopoly on violence and can decide
<br>
to become a defacto government. How do you protect against this?
