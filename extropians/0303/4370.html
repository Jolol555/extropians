Well... artistic pictures probably don't count...
<br>
<p>[Azulejos are brightly colored decorative ceramic tiles influenced by
<br>
the Moorish and Spanish designs before the 16th century. Around the
<br>
mid-16th century, the Portuguese developed their own style when a new
<br>
Italian method allowed images to be painted onto the clay, rather
<br>
than using colored clay. Later, by the 17th century, decadent and
<br>
colorful images were all the rage. This  azulejos is located at the
<br>
Santiago do Cacém Pousada, on the side of the main building as you
<br>
enter. Some pictures of the rest of the Pousada can be seen at their
<br>
web site:

<br>
<p><p>About the Portugal naturist beaches: The Portuguese hospitality
<br>
includes welcoming the naturists, and with more kilometers of sandy
<br>
beaches than most other European countries, plus a very liberal
<br>
attitude, it's perfect for baring all.
<br>
<p>My first suggestion for an extropian naturist holiday is along one
<br>
of the beaches of the  Troja Peninsula, which is about one hundred
<br>
kilometers south of Lisboa. There is one naturist beach nearby to
<br>
where you exit from the ferry, if you take the ferry across from
<br>
Setúbal.
<br>
<p>You can see the Troja Peninsula at the far distance of this somewhat
<br>
washed out picture I took from the Arrabida cliffs of the area
<br>
around Setúbal.

<br>
<p>These show the fine sand, the blue sky, and the extraordinarily blue
<br>
water:

<br>
<p>The water is cool, though, along the Portuguese west coast, so it
<br>
might be better to find those beaches on the southern Algarve
<br>
coast. Sagres is a good location with a beautiful beach, and
<br>
there is a naturist beach somewhere nearby to here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amara.com/port/SagesBeach&amp;Pousada_50.jpg">http://www.amara.com/port/SagesBeach&amp;Pousada_50.jpg</a>nuxis<br>
<p>The most southwestern point of the European continent is located
<br>
near Sagres at the lighthouse Cabo Sao Vicente. You can stand on the
<br>
corner where the Atlantic Ocean meets on three sides.  The 'bulb' of
<br>
the lighthouse is a very large (several humans high, a couple humans
<br>
thick) piece of beveled silicate, as finely crafted as telescope
<br>
glass, and extremely powerful: it can shine 90 km once every 5 sec.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amara.com/port/CaboVicente2_20.jpg">http://www.amara.com/port/CaboVicente2_20.jpg</a>
<br>
<p>The history of the area is tremendous. It was in Sagres, that the
<br>
Infante D. Henrique, Prince Henry the Navigator, in the 15th
<br>
century, came to work on his obsession to push back the frontiers of
<br>
the known world, which opened the unique phase in Portuguese history
<br>
called 'The Discoveries'. Columbus had his beginnings there too...
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amara.com/port/HenryNavSchool.jpg">http://www.amara.com/port/HenryNavSchool.jpg</a>
<br>
<p>[He was 24 years old when by one of those quirks of fate, Columbus
<br>
ended up on the doorstep of the Sagres school of navigation. He was
<br>
with an armed convoy on its way from Genoa to England in May 1476
<br>
when it was attacked by pirates off Cape St Vincent. His ship went
<br>
down in the ensuing fight and, though wounded, he managed to escape
<br>
by swimming six miles to shore. How long Christopher Columbus spent
<br>
in the Algarve is not known. He is said to have spent some time
<br>
recuperating in Lisbon, a city he came to know well. In 1478, he
<br>
sailed from Lisbon to Portuguese Madeira as a buying agent for a
<br>
major Genoese company. The following year he married the daughter of
<br>
the governor of the island of Porto Santo in the Madeira group. That
<br>
was where their only child, a son, was born. It was only after
<br>
sailing to the Portuguese trading post of Soo Jorge da Mina on the
<br>
Gold Coast (now Ghana) that Columbus got a real taste for
<br>
exploration, as opposed to mere business travel. It was then that
<br>
the notion of voyaging westward to find new lands took hold of him
<br>
and became all consuming. Only after the death of his wife, Dona
<br>
Filipa, did Columbus leave his adopted country (Portugal) with his
<br>
son, Diego, to seek sponsorship for his proposals from King
<br>
Ferdinand and Queen Isabella of Spain. A deal was agreed after seven
<br>
years of wrangling. And thus it was under the Spanish, rather than
<br>
the Portuguese flag that he discovered the New World.]
