<p><em>&gt; &gt;What I have learned:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (i) Any measure such as the Patriot Act can cut both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     ways, and one must always imagine how one would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     feel if the opposite party were in power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;(ii) It's not probable that the likes of Sean Penn (who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     is not half as bad as Jane Fonda was), or any others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     will be persecuted by the U.S. government for their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     political beliefs.  I could be wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The argument was [is?] that people will only be persecuted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for their beliefs when it is advantageous for the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do so.
</em><br>
<p>Any huge system, like a government, will always do what is
<br>
advantageous for it to do.  Right now, for example, in almost
<br>
any Western country to arrest people for speaking their views
<br>
is practically unthinkable (not only because of the political
<br>
consequences, but, like other entitles, governments are 
<br>
creatures of habit too).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The guiding principle of both parties seems to be to ensure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that everyone can be proven to be a dangerous criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whenever they so choose.
</em><br>
<p>I think it's fair to say that this is their tendency,
<br>
but hardly their &quot;guiding principle&quot;.  I would suppose
<br>
that there are many people in the Bush administration,
<br>
just as there were many in the Clinton administration,
<br>
whose view of their political adversaries is so jaundiced
<br>
that they would be quite happy if events moved in a
<br>
direction that allowed them to merely arrest their
<br>
opponents.  However, even the most rabid of them understand
<br>
that it's still practically unthinkable.
<br>
<p>Now some people on this list will instantly retort &quot;OH YEAH?
<br>
IT'S BECOMING MORE THINKABLE WITH EACH PASSING MOMENT!&quot;.
<br>
But perhaps progress can be made by imagining in the most
<br>
realistic manner just what events could transpire that would
<br>
give these people the opportunity to begin rounding up
<br>
their opponents.
<br>
<p>(1) The country becomes palpably involved in a life-or-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;death struggle.  E.g., Japanese troops in 1942 finally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;conquer Denver, with Dallas-Fort Worth soon to fall.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or an evil third-world terrorist group succeeds in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;smuggling in so many atomic bombs that they begin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going off one every two days.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In either of these scenarios, most Western governments,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at least those with any backbone such as the U.S., would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crack down on any---repeat, any---effort that appeared
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the slightest way to hinder the war effort.
<br>
<p>(2) Polarization evolves to many, many times the level
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's ever been in the U.S.  For example, the anti-Bush
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crowd becomes so vehement in their denunciations of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the &quot;illegal cowboy who seized control of the Presidency&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they rebel;  or, vice-versa (since I *do* understand
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;what bias is, unlike some people), the right-wing, up to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and including a majority of the people, becomes so rabid
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they literally see peace demonstrators and liberals
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as enemy apparatchiks working against the interests of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;U.S. to the degree that they are as big a threat as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;literal terrorists.
<br>
<p>At present, I see almost zero chance of scenarios like these
<br>
developing.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And then only to do so when it's to their advantage.  Does this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem correct to you?
