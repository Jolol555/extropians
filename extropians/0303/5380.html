<p>&quot;And then there's Sean Hannity of FOX. He takes the prize for the most

<br>
<p>Perhaps he takes the prize for being most offensive to you. I don't think any 
<br>
fair-minded observer would characterize Mr. Hannity as anything less than an 
<br>
unapologetic conservative. However, he has yet to do anything as nauseating 
<br>
as a &quot;human interest&quot; interview with Saddam Hussein, so he is most certainly 
<br>
not the most offensive journalist to me, or I'm sure a number of other 
<br>
members.
<br>
<p>&quot;A few weeks ago, Hannity interviewed a liberal who made what I thought was a
<br>
very good point: she argued that Bush had only aggravated the situation with
<br>
N. Korea by labeling that country as part of his &quot;Axis of Evil.&quot; In her
<br>
view, the word &quot;Evil,&quot; especially when capitalized, has religious
<br>
connotations and should not be used by high-level government officials in
<br>
international affairs. I'm not a liberal but I agreed completely with her
<br>
point.&quot;
<br>
<p>Aside from the issue of whether or not &quot;Evil&quot; should be used by high-level 
<br>
government officials, I would ask in what sense you seriously believe Bush 
<br>
&quot;aggravated&quot; the situation in North Korea. Bush's use of that terminology did 
<br>
not suddenly made Kim Jong Il desire to possess nuclear weapons. He in no way 
<br>
motivated Kim Jong Il and communist North Korea to suddenly desire to conquer 
<br>
the Democratic South. He in no way made Kim Jong Il's regime any more brutal 
<br>
and tyrannical. So, really, how did Bush's labeling of Kim Jong Il's regime 
<br>
as a bad one make it any more bad, &quot;evil&quot;, or any more horrible than it 
<br>
already was? Unless you are seriously going to attempt to argue that by 
<br>
calling a spade a spade, Bush has somehow absolved Kim's regime of all 
<br>
responsibility for its subsequent crimes against humanity, since after all, 
<br>
Bush &quot;aggravated&quot; the situation?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
