<p><em>&gt; I need to read all the posts in a thread before replying,

</em><br>
<p>Ah !  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; John Clark wisely notes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;International Law&quot; is a silly term anyway,....

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A student of history, I see.

<em>&gt; Ron adds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is true that the League of Nations failed and now it appears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the United Nations will fail also.  For purpose of discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; let me assume that the UN is dead and is just in the process of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; final collapse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; -- it is over but the shouting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Lee)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish to demur. 
</em><br>
<p>I wish to request that you use your considerable anaytical skills to 
<br>
address these important issues of the day AND have some respect
<br>
for your fellow posters. 
<br>
<p>This for you should be very easy. Simply read and think before you
<br>
post. I know you can do both well but will you choose to? I get 
<br>
worried when I see you opening up with a comment like you did 
<br>
AND then then you start combining posts from John and Ron. This
<br>
sort of behavior unchecked will dumb down the content of the list.
<br>
<p>Even bright people can say dumb things when they don't think.
<br>
<p>I get worried that yet another worth while topic will be infected by
<br>
&nbsp;the &quot;why I love being Lee Corbin&quot; virus written and propagadated 
<br>
by guess who? 
<br>
<p>Please Lee, if only you'd use your skills for good ;-) Threads in lists
<br>
are serial and you sometimes want to hog all the conversations at 
<br>
once.
<br>
<p>(You continue)
<br>
<em>&gt;I also thought that all the leftists were dead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong when they gave for one reason not to invade Iraq:  &quot;It will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean the death of the U.N.&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Why?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The U.N. will always be around.  It will always be around just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is now, and will always pass resolutions condemning someone or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other.
</em><br>
<p>Just as it is now, that seems very unlikely. Why do you say that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  This is hardly a useless role.  The weight of world opinion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The U.N. will stay alive and in its essentially same position
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because and only because it will continue to be supported by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earth's major nations.  India, Russia, the U.S., France, Germany,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Japan, China, and the U.K. will continue to support it for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very same reasons that they always have.  There is even a hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that its authority will grow.
</em><br>
<p>Lee do you understand the current configuration of the Security 
<br>
Council and its voting procedure? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it is a setback for the U.N. when it proved itself unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to back up its own resolutions.
</em><br>
<p>It did not in fact so prove. On this you are dead wrong. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And that's no one's fault but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; France, Russia, Germany, and China, the gang of four.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee
</em><br>
<p>I suspect the &quot;Aitken Drum&quot; persona has taken over again. Your
<br>
talking rot and I know you can do better. I look forward to
<br>
discussing this and other matters when you read some more or 
<br>
slow down a bit and pick a piece you can actually chew over
<br>
in some depth.
<br>
<p>Regards for you, (but not for the above post)
<br>
