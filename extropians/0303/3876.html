</em><br>
<p>I recall a bit from a Niven story (I think called &quot;Veil of Anarchy&quot;)
<br>
about a fellow who had a digital watch implanted beneath his skin.
<br>
<p>Given such devices currently run on batteries with lives of 3 years or
<br>
more, I'd want something that consumes a bit more power if it is going
<br>
to help me lose weight.
<br>
<p>What I'd like is an implanted PDA in my brain with a HUD in one or both
<br>
eyes, a GPS unit, and a cell phone and FM/XM radio receiver built into
<br>
my jaw and skull. The antenna would be a meshed phased array between
<br>
skull and skin. Having such a broad antenna should minimize EM risk.
<br>
The whole setup is voice and blink/point of focus controlled.
<br>
<p>Total consumption should be around 5 watts.
<br>
<p>To detail how NOT to lose weight:
<br>
My mother went under the knife two months ago to get her stomach
<br>
stapled. The arthritis in her knees makes knee replacement a needed
<br>
thing, but the docs don't want to do it at her age while she weighs
<br>
over 250 lbs, so she opted for surgery (she swims and works out several
<br>
times a week, for those thinking she is being lazy. A thyroid removal a
<br>
decade ago is the primary reason for her slow metabolism.)
<br>
<p>Being an individual who has never healed very well, her recovery from
<br>
this operation has been about as bad as it could be. Three days after
<br>
the operation, it was found that an old adhesion had kinked the small
<br>
intestine, causing fluid to back up and burst a suture at the stomach.
<br>
Her whole abdominal cavity was therefore infected. She eventually lost
<br>
2/3 of her colon and a yard of her small intestine due to loss of blood
<br>
flow. She spent over a month in the ICU, all of it sedated and with her
<br>
incision wide open due to swelling preventing it from being sewed shut.
<br>
She has been in the Vascular Surgery ward under 24 hour nursing care
<br>
for the last month and is concious, but with a tracheotomy, a tube
<br>
through the nose and four into her abdomen for draining fluid while she
<br>
continues to heal.
<br>
<p>I am frankly quite shocked that surgeons today are still relying on
<br>
plain old sutures to close abdominal incisions.
<br>
<p>I am also pissed that the docs demanded she lose this weight to get her
<br>
artificial knees, since men that weight get them all the time. The docs
<br>
claim they would wear out in 15 years. I said so freaking what! By then
<br>
they could clone her some new knees fer ghus sake.
<br>
<p>Lastly, I am perturbed at what is considered acceptable nursing care
<br>
today. She is at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center, which is
<br>
considered a top notch facility, and the neglect and bad attitude of
<br>
many of the nurses has annoyed us to no end. I pity those who have to
<br>
stay at lower quality institutions. As Doctor MacCoy would say, &quot;This
<br>
is barbaric!&quot;
