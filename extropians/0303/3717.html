<p>How do we be *effective* within democracies? Excellent question.
<br>
<p>We have just one vote each. But far, far more importantly, we have
<br>
in open societies the right to free speech, including free speech about
<br>
government and free speech about policy.
<br>
<p>The right sort of knowledge can be power indeed when it is coupled
<br>
with passion and a willingness to effect policy through the prudent 
<br>
exercise of the right to free speech. A precious right which generations
<br>
before us have bequeathed us with their blood. A vote is just one vote.
<br>
But knowledge is the fulcrum and free speech is the lever. With these,
<br>
even one person can move the world.
<br>
<p>So what do you *know*?  How *strong* is your fulcrum?  What
<br>
will you say with your precious right to speech?R
