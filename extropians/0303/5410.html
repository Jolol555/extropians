&lt;&lt;You don't think labelling NK as evil and then going after the weakest of 
<br>
the
<br>
three Axis members might make NK more urgently interested in getting nukes, 
<br>
so
<br>
as to fend off attack?
<br>
-xx- Damien X-)   &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>North Korea was already hotly pursuing nukes, and breaking the deal with 
<br>
Clinton, before 9-11, was more than just another day in Seprtember.  
<br>
Similarly, the old Axis of world war 2, Mussolini's Italy was toppled a year 
<br>
before Japan surrendered. You have to ask whether NK might have been 
<br>
interested in selling it ICBM rocketry to Saddam, to Iran; and then ask 
<br>
yourself whether you are going to bet that the US was going to be safer 
<br>
follwoing the Bush1/Clinton doctrine of appeasement? Now ask if NK customers 
<br>
are essentially neutralized, who are they going to sell to?  
<br>
<p>Finally, as an armchair general, rather then put American troops at risk, 
<br>
rather then put the SK at risk; the regime of Kim Jung iLL might be better 
<br>
dealth with in a very Entropian &lt;==(yes) way?
