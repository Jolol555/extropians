<p>Gallup poll says 70% support the war.  Someone else (Kull) estimates 40% are
<br>
strongly behind it, 40% going along with the President or patriotism.  10 days
<br>
ago the number who thought it was going well plummeted from 53% to 34%.  A
<br>
majority think the risk of terrorism will rise after the war.  Kull also found
<br>
Illinois was more opposed to the war than California, to break one stereotype.
<br>
(I wonder if that's related to the Democrats taking over Illinois for the
<br>
first time in a long while.)

<p><em>&gt; so only if it saves US soldier's lives (i.e. dealing with human

<p>Recently I posted a link to another poll which had Americans thinking the
<br>
early statements by our leaders were too optimistic, expecting the war to go
<br>
for months, and saying that 5000 US casualties or 5000 Iraqi casualties were
<br>
too many.
