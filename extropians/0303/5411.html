<p><em>&gt; GTS,

<em>&gt;        Am I correct that you consider this sequence of events as

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I hope you realize that I had my tongue planted firmly in cheek when I
<br>
posted that message. :) My Mafia war analogy is highly simplistic and fails
<br>
to account for other important factors driving this war.
<br>
<p>However I do believe there is grain of truth to what I wrote. Bush Jr., if
<br>
he is any son at all, would be and should be interested in protecting his
<br>
father's legacy (Bush Sr. has often been criticized for ending the first war
<br>
too soon) and any good son would be inclined to seek revenge against a man
<br>
who tried to kill his father. I don't think it's especially lamentable, but
<br>
it does open up serious questions about putting our military in harm's way
<br>
to settle a personal score.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Search my memory as I might I cannot remember the Iraqis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trying to &quot;whack&quot; Bush Sr.  But if that happened I assume it happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on Bill Clinton's watch.  
</em><br>
<p>I don't remember the exact timing. I vaguely recall that evidence of
<br>
Saddam's conspiracy to murder Bush Sr. was discovered and publicized under
<br>
Clinton's watch, but I'm quite sure the plot was hatched while Bush Sr. was
<br>
in office. (Why whack an ex-president?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I want to know is this: why can a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign government or ruler decide to &quot;whack&quot; an American citizen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without Bill Clinton reacting vigorously? 
</em><br>
<p>Maybe because Bill Clinton is a democrat and no friend of the Bush family?
<br>
(Again with tongue in cheek.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; GTS, no country worthy of its salt allows its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizenry to be killed by a foreign power so why was it okay for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sadaam to attempt to kill Bush Sr., if that is true? Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>I didn't say it was okay.
