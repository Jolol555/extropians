<p>I think that's more pessimistic than you need to be. The mistake is thinking
<br>
that &quot;medicine has been around for thousands of years&quot;. In one sense clearly
<br>
that's true - Doctoring/surgery has been around for that time. However
<br>
medicine as a science has only been around since about the time of Pasteur.
<br>
Since it has to deal with the subject matter of several disciplines (Human
<br>
biology, molecular biology, sociology, biochemistry, the biology of bacteria
<br>
and viruses to name just a few) it's not surprising development has been
<br>
relatively slow. There are a number of medical traditions in the various
<br>
civilisations up to the mid19th century (the 'western' one is basically
<br>
Galen plus some input from the Arabs) none of which are particularly
<br>
effective. When you compare the effectiveness of scientific medicine to the
<br>
traditional models, you become more optimistic, I feel.
