</em><br>
<p>Just as with the Lord of the Rings movie, which wasn't released in all 
<br>
its expanded DVD glory till a year after the theatrical release, the 
<br>
best video from our new war won't show up till long after the event. For 
<br>
instance, on Cryptome they linked to a neat film of an AC-130 gunship 
<br>
firing its weapons on hapless Afghanis. It was neat to see the effort, 
<br>
in terms of 105mm shells expended, to kill just one guy! It was an 
<br>
infrared video, and the people-targets were all lit up like glowing 
<br>
stick figures. Coolest part was when they finally hit this one guy and 
<br>
you can see a severed limb flying off, still glowing with body heat!
<br>
<p>But sadly, you won't see that on CNN.
<br>
<p>And it's not like we don't have the technology. Look at those souped-up 
<br>
M16's our troops have now. It doesn't seem like it would take much extra 
<br>
weight to add a small camera on each weapon so each kill-shot could be 
<br>
recorded for posterity. Perhaps editted into a family video for the 
<br>
widow and orphans.
<br>
<p>I think having more video would make everybody much more supportive of 
<br>
the war. It should be possible to have a little camera on each bomb or 
<br>
artillery shell. In fact, I think the U.S. should personalize each and 
<br>
every bomb, give it it's own URL and let children post messages which 
<br>
would be printed via some sort of hand-held dot-matrix printer on the 
<br>
munition as it's loaded. Combine this with the camera on the bomb 
<br>
transmitting it's last image so you could actually match up individual 
<br>
dead iraqis with the bomb that killed them. Then the kids could write 
<br>
the Iraqi widows and orphans explaning why their husbands and fathers 
<br>
had to die, and it'd all be archived for future historians.
