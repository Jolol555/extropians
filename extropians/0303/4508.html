In response to Mike and Alex, although some may think we are being 
<br>
somewhat extreme: This is similar to the protesters in the US who are 
<br>
have recently been sneaking onto Air Force bases to hinder/sabotage 
<br>
the US military effort. The USAF has now stated that anyone sneaking 
<br>
onto Air Force bases will be shot. (period)
<br>
<p>So any day now the news will undoubtedly be that someone trespassed 
<br>
onto a military base and was, actually, shot.
<br>
<p>Does this criminalize the US, the USAF, or the US government? Well, 
<br>
no. &quot;US Citizen&quot; is not a license to do whatever you damn well 
<br>
please, and does not condone immunities or for that matter super 
<br>
powers.
<br>
<p>Which brings me to the bulldozer. Any loss of life is a sad affair. 
<br>
But social protest must abide by higher laws, and I don't mean 
<br>
international law over local law, I mean the laws of physics. You 
<br>
shouldn't even cross the street without making eye contact with the 
<br>
person in the car on the stop line, nevermind jump/walk or otherwise 
<br>
locomote in front of bulldozers.
<br>
<p>I find myself in agreement with the harsh reality of illegal 
<br>
combatants, and wonder if that will carry over onto American soil 
<br>
with this whole Air Base fiasco.

<em>&gt;  &gt; 2. She deliberately put herself in harm's way, and became a contender

<em>&gt;  &gt; That being said, it is still an undisputed fact that an Israeli Army
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; bulldozer crushed to death an American citizen engaged in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; nonviolent, unarmed, political protest. When someone like Saddam
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; add that to the long list of reasons justifying his ouster.

<em>&gt;What she did was make herself an enemy combatant by acting as a human
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shield for illegal combatant members of a terrorist guerrilla
</em><br>
<em>&gt;insurgency. What SHE did is a war crime, and her Palestinian hosts are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;similarly and specifically war criminals for allowing her to do it.
