&quot;Emotional reactions, indeed.&quot;

<p><em>&gt; &quot;You can argue all you want that it could have been much worse, but

<p>&quot;I think you're blinded somehow (emotion?) from understanding what he's
<br>
saying here. Consider the immediately-below thing you also quoted.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I consider this war to be immoral from the start, but I also consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of bitter enemies.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;A fairly plain reading of these two texts suggests that [charles] matus is
<br>
describing consequences, *not* expressing a preference. Can you not see
<br>
this?&quot;
<br>
<p>I could see that, and I indeed called him to task in that in the following
<br>
question, which I believe was the very next sentance which you cut off,
<br>
where I said &quot;That being said, which manner would you prefer it be conducted
<br>
(if it is to be conducted anyway), massive civilian causalties, or taking
<br>
great care to reduce such casualties?  You seem to merely acknowledge the
<br>
different manners, but not state which you would prefer.&quot;  Charles went on a
<br>
paragraph or two long tangent about how by merely injuring Iraqis we are
<br>
breeding more hatred than if we just outright killed them.
