<em>&gt; It's not so difficult to find those [Al-Jazeera]

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm sure that is so, but as you know I recently
<br>
suffered a serious breach of my computer security, and
<br>
while investigating it I learned that these P2P
<br>
networks are fraught with viruses, trojans, spyware
<br>
and other malware. They are the favorite hang-outs for
<br>
vandalistic script-kiddies with nothing better to do
<br>
than screw up other people's lives. In fact the full
<br>
version of Kazaa itself won't even run unless one
<br>
agrees to install certain (supposedly harmless)
<br>
spyware files. 
<br>
<p>For those who choose to use these P2P file-sharing
<br>
programs: I strongly recommend that every received
<br>
file be scanned with a high-quality updated virus
<br>
scanner *and* a good spyware/trojan detector. Even
<br>
then the protection is not guaranteed... there is
<br>
usually a window of time during which new malicious
<br>
files are spread via P2P before they are registered in
<br>
the updates from the anti-malware vendors.
<br>
<p>My own recent security breach may have occurred as a
<br>
result of my previous membership in the Kazaa network.
<br>
I recall receiving a harmless-looking file that caused
<br>
my computer to behave erratically and then lock up.
<br>
I've since uninstalled Kazaa and all similar
<br>
file-sharing apps and reformatted. No more P2P for me,
<br>
thank you. It's not as though I can't afford to buy my
<br>
own music and software. As the saying goes, &quot;Fool me
<br>
once, shame on you. But fool me twice, shame on me.&quot;
<br>
<p>But I'm getting off-topic here... well, actually I'll
<br>
just change the topic...
