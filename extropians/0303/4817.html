<p>How would you define the &quot;rules of reciprocity&quot;?
<br>
<p>It seems to me a straightforward way to analyze huge numbers of economic
<br>
activities as deployments of force (&quot;the capacity to do work&quot;).
<br>
Moving money is work and can instigate work - whether the result is
<br>
&quot;violent&quot; or &quot;nonviolent&quot; is an aesthetic judgment. Paying someone to
<br>
manufacture a product is parallel to paying someone to murder a person -
<br>
just different results of the exercise of force. Moving (enough) money can
<br>
influence the circumstances under which a manufacture or a murder may
<br>
be considered legal or popular, for example. One could also look at the
<br>
ability to direct labor - for violent or nonviolent purposes, or the
<br>
economic ability to own and use materials which may be violent or
<br>
nonviolent in their effects, depending on your aesthetics.  Is it violent
<br>
to kill someone? Is it violent to make them buy your product? Is it
<br>
violent to keep them in a single area? Is it violent to control and
<br>
direct their behaviors? Is it violent to control how much property they
<br>
own? Is it violent to make people sick?
<br>
Since the various natural sciences are built around examining forces, and
<br>
economic &amp; sociological &amp; many other sciences/fields, too - it would be
<br>
probably be best to speak of the world as a continual welter of forces,
<br>
and to see ideologies' ability to aesthetically categorize some outcomes
<br>
as &quot;violence&quot; or &quot;nonviolence&quot; as just another force. The myth would be
<br>
&quot;forcelessness&quot; - the idea that anything has no effect on other things,
<br>
that it exercises no force, no force that an ideology could label either
<br>
&quot;violent&quot; or &quot;nonviolent&quot;.
