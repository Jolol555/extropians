You are right, in the sense that the number of possible reactions is 
<br>
large.  If I only had a single expectation, and pinned everything on 
<br>
that, then I would agree with your assessment.  But I have a range of 
<br>
expectations that I consider more or less probable.  And one of the ones 
<br>
that I consider likely is that some measurable fraction of the 
<br>
population will be motivated by revenge.
<br>
<p>As to my being too &quot;unemotional&quot;, you are probably right.  But that's my 
<br>
reaction.  I have the typical nerd detatchment from active interest in 
<br>
politics, though I realize that this is not the best reaction.  So I do 
<br>
my best. 
<br>
<p>I consider it likely that very few Iraqi support Saddam.  This may just 
<br>
make them more angry when they are attacked in the cause of someone they 
<br>
would rather not defend.  And despite the public announcements, it's a 
<br>
bit difficult to surrender to an artillery shell that's fired from 
<br>
beyond your visual horizon.  So people who might have been our 
<br>
supporters are turned into our bitter enemies... (or, I admit, perhaps not).
