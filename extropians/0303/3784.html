<p><p>I am having trouble understanding why you do not already have 
<br>
more than enough information about the processes so far and the 
<br>
stated objectives to cleanly judge whether this call to war is 
<br>
reasonable or not.  I do not understand exactly why you group 
<br>
the marchers as a separate entity separate from and clearly not 
<br>
you.  The marchers are from all walks of life and all points on 
<br>
the political spectrum.  They are united only in believing this 
<br>
war is unjustified.
