-----Original Message-----

From: Lee Daniel Crocker [mailto:<a href="mailto:lee@piclab.com?Subject=RE:%20Obesity%20(was%20Extropic%20Priniciples)">lee@piclab.com</a>] 
<br>
<p>&quot;I think most talk about obesity here is taking a decidedly un-Extropian
<br>
point of view...I have no interest at all in being a an emaciated
<br>
exercise-obsessed 120-year-old human; I want to be a 1000-year-old sexy
<br>
glutton.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am in total agreement, instead of using our mass of accumulated knowledge
<br>
and our extropian brains to come up with new laws, regulations, and
<br>
restrictions, lets give the individual something that they will want that
<br>
will make them healthier and live longer, and solve the post-industrialized
<br>
worlds obesity 'problem'.  Hence my support of the device I outlined in my
<br>
recent post.  
<br>
<p>I want to be a healthy fit attractive 1,000 year old glutton as well.  A
<br>
small calorie burning implant would enable just that, it would not have the
<br>
free-radical conducive damage that cellular combustion does, and could be
<br>
used to power other implants and devices.  Need to get 20 blocks to the
<br>
other side of town or stroll the through park, have a piece of cheese cake
<br>
that'll power the small wheels on your shoe for a week.  
<br>
<p>I can think of nothing negative of such a device, society all-ready accepts
<br>
implants for aesthetic purposes, this would have a functional and healthy
<br>
purpose.  Though it would put the current trial lawyers targeting 'big food'
<br>
out of work, and surely technophobic greens and luddites would oppose it.  
<br>
<p>It sounds like such a great idea, any reasons anyone can present why I
<br>
shouldn't think it one?
