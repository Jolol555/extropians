<em>&gt;&gt;### I think that many of us would agree on a more rigorous division -

<em>&gt;&gt;roughly, &quot;violence&quot; non-consensually ends life, or causes severe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;non-consensual physical suffering. There is a bit of a gray area
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;regarding extreme mental suffering but for the most part it is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;major source of misunderstanding. Therefore, money motivating a hitman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is violence, money moving a baker is not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wasn't bringing in the issues of consent (or intention or will) because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the way the mind forms consent is vulnerable to forces just like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else, and of course consenting actions can exert force.
</em><br>
<p>But the issue of consent is utterly essential to the discussion 
<br>
as it is essential to any notion of freedom vs coercion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does a suicide bomber consent to committing suicide? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  If he didn't it wouldn't be a &quot;suicide&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Does he consent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopting the suicide-bomber-philosophy? 
</em><br>
<p>He consents in many places along the way that leads to a 
<br>
conclusion that his life is of less value than what he thinks 
<br>
this bit of violence will accomplish.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does he consent to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coincidentally exposed to the suicide-bomber-philosophy? 
</em><br>
<p>That would be silly.  No one has full consent over what memes 
<br>
they will encounter.  That does not mean they are powerless to 
<br>
choose which memes they will carry in the sense of acting on 
<br>
them vs which ones they will oppose.  There is really no such 
<br>
separate thing as a suicide-bomber-philosophy or a 
<br>
suicide-bomber-meme.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Does he consent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to living in circumstances that favor the adoption of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide-bomber-philosophy? AS you can see, the further you back up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis, the more &quot;consent&quot; disappears in a cloud of smoke.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not in the least.  This analysis is empty as it does not 
<br>
consider what consent is and is not and what it can and cannot 
<br>
do.  Saying it cannot do everything and thus disappears is invalid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The same goes for economic activities: does a person consent to buying a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product he chooses to buy? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does he consent to only two products of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort he wants being available? 
</em><br>
<p>His power of consent does not determine how many competitors are 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;in a particular field directly or how many products of the 
<br>
kind he wants are currently being offered except indirectly in 
<br>
that the fact of his ability to choose (consent) makes 
<br>
competition possible.  Again, such overarching consent as to 
<br>
self-determine the number of things that can be chosen from is 
<br>
not in the least necessary for consent to be real.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Does he consent to only one product being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sold practically near to him?
</em><br>
<p>Same answer as above and also irrelevant in first-world 
<br>
communities where an abundance of product choices are generally 
<br>
at hand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does he consent to receiving marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influences? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, to some degree.  There is a continuing battle to widen the 
<br>
degree of choice here.  Also, marketing does not overrule consent.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Does he consent to acquiring the characteristics that make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marketing effective? 
</em><br>
<p>Marketing can only influence choices to some degree.  It is a 
<br>
technique of persuasion and not coercion.   The targets of the 
<br>
marketing still choose.
<br>
<p>The deeper argument that consent is meaningless unless one can 
<br>
chose (consent to) one's own nature is empty and devoid of value.
<br>
<p><p>Does he consent to being born with that
<br>
<em>&gt; characteristic?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Same answer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words, I think &quot;free will&quot; should enter the analysis only as what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is, a kind of mental construct to deal with the fact that human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot quickly (in realtime) analyze all the forces operating upon them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and all the inner processes and external processes affecting the ongoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise of their personality. The mind's self-mental model is crude, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contains this &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; conceit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I see.  I was not aware I was speaking with an automaton.  I 
<br>
will choose to stop doing so now. :-)
<br>
<p>Seriously, questions of freedom vs. coercion can only be asked 
<br>
and answered in terms of what *is* including the nature of human 
<br>
beings.  It cannot be meaningfully discussed in terms of some 
<br>
imaginary possibility of real &quot;consent&quot; to choose everything 
<br>
including the nature of and contents of reality down to any 
<br>
desired level.
<br>
<p>What would you substitute for economic consent/choice which you 
<br>
regard as coercion?  The State choosing for us?
