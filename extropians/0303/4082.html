Without being alarmist, because this will likely not be an end of human 
<br>
civilization; we are going to have to path thru an ugly epoch. The Iraq War 
<br>
2, will be simple enough. More significantly will be somehow containing North 
<br>
Korea, and now Iran.  I leave it up to you if negotiation is possible, and 
<br>
achievable in light of North Korea's abandonment of the 1994 agreement, with 
<br>
the Clinton administration.

<p>Near the town of Natanz in central Iran, 160 newly minted centrifuges stand 
<br>
in neat rows inside a nuclear complex that the United States and other 
<br>
countries were surprised to learn about only seven months ago. The machines 
<br>
have been tested and judged fully operational, senior Bush administration 
<br>
officials say. Sometime this year they will begin spinning hot uranium gas 
<br>
into nuclear fuel.
<br>
<p>In a nearby building, workers are assembling parts for 1,000 more 
<br>
centrifuges, part of a constellation of 5,000 machines that will be linked 
<br>
together in a vast uranium enrichment plant now under construction. When the 
<br>
project is completed in 2005, Iran will be capable of producing enough 
<br>
enriched uranium for several nuclear bombs each year.
<br>
<p>Details about the Natanz complex are beginning to trickle out following the 
<br>
first visit to the site by officials from the United Nations late last month. 
<br>
U.S. officials who were briefed on the visit described Iran's progress last 
<br>
week as &quot;startling&quot; and &quot;eye-opening,&quot; so much so that intelligence agencies 
<br>
are being forced to dramatically shorten estimates for when Iran may acquire 
<br>
nuclear weapons.
<br>
<p>But equally striking is the extent to which Iran's breakthrough caught the 
<br>
United States and others by surprise. For a decade, U.S. efforts to keep 
<br>
nuclear weapons away from Iran focused on a location far to the south, a 
<br>
nuclear power plant being built with Russian help near the port city of 
<br>
Bushehr. Fearing that Iran would extract plutonium from the reactor's fuel 
<br>
for a nuclear weapon, U.S. officials have imposed sanctions against Russian 
<br>
companies and exerted enormous pressure on Russia, China and Ukraine to 
<br>
prevent them from supplying the project with sensitive equipment and 
<br>
know-how.
<br>
<p>All along, the Tehran government was quietly pursuing a different course, 
<br>
U.S. officials now say. While not foreclosing the possibility of 
<br>
plutonium-based bombs, they report, Iran built a clandestine and highly 
<br>
sophisticated nuclear infrastructure that would allow it to seek 
<br>
uranium-based weapons.&gt;&gt;
