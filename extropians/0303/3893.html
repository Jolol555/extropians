<br>
<p>Is this  Lovins-esque, or what?
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;Microgrids: reliable power in a small package             
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In 1996, a sagging power line in Oregon brushed against a tree, and within 
<br>
minutes 12 million customers in eight states lost power. Such is the 
<br>
vulnerability of today's power grid. 
<br>
<p>To address this weakness, Berkeley Lab scientists are helping to develop a 
<br>
new approach to power generation in which a cluster of small, on-site 
<br>
generators serves office buildings, industrial parks, and homes. Called a 
<br>
microgrid, the system could help shoulder the nation's growing thirst for 
<br>
electricity — estimated to jump by almost 400 gigawatts by 2025 — without 
<br>
overburdening aging transmission lines or building the 1,000 new power plants 
<br>
required to meet this demand. And it may make statewide blackouts a thing of 
<br>
the past, or at least ensure that service to critical equipment is 
<br>
maintained.
<br>
<p>&quot;Catastrophic loss of power to all systems like the 1996 blackout should be 
<br>
impossible,&quot; says Chris Marnay, an energy scientist in Berkeley Lab's 
<br>
Environmental Energy Technologies Division. &quot;If we sat down today to devise a 
<br>
power system from scratch, our design wouldn't resemble the one we have.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>

<br>
Technologies Division stand in front of generators that power and heat a 
<br>
laboratory at BD Biosciences in San Diego, Calif. The Consortium for Electric 
<br>
Reliability Technology Solutions (CERTS) is studying this project as an early 
<br>
example of on-site power generation.    
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Instead of relying solely on large power plants, a portion of the nation's 
<br>
electricity needs could be met by small generators such as ordinary 
<br>
reciprocating engines, microturbines, fuel cells, and photovoltaic systems. A 
<br>
small network of these generators, each of which typically produce no more 
<br>
than 500 kilowatts, would provide reliable power to anything from a postal 
<br>
sorting facility to a neighborhood.
<br>
<p>This microgrid appears to the larger grid as if it's any other customer. And 
<br>
it can quickly switch between operating on and off the grid: when the grid 
<br>
offers cheap electricity, the microgrid can purchase it, but if prices rise 
<br>
or there's a power failure, the microgrid can isolate itself. It can also 
<br>
temporarily shed unimportant equipment such as refrigerators during power 
<br>
shortages. This ensures uninterrupted power to the critical computers, 
<br>
communications infrastructure, and control systems that drive today's 
<br>
economy.
<br>
<p>&quot;Everything is interdependent. For example, if vital communications go down, 
<br>
other sectors falter,&quot; Marnay says. &quot;But if sensitive equipment is powered 
<br>
locally, our vulnerable, centralized power system becomes much less critical, 
<br>
and is a less attractive terrorist target&quot;....&gt;&gt;
