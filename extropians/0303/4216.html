Anders Sandberg:
<br>
<em>&gt;I think France and other more central nations actually may have more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;prejudices, but the potential of becoming a real part of society
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there is larger for an immigrant.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps. I'm one test case, so I can tell you more after a longer
<br>
time here (Italy). I've heard again and again from my colleagues
<br>
that I've encountered &quot;special situations&quot; with reference to the
<br>
attitudes of the questura (police), and the attitudes of the local
<br>
people with flats to rent. I can't figure out all of the reasons for
<br>
my persistent difficulties with finding a good accommodation and
<br>
with simple things like getting a resident permit (well.... I'm
<br>
embedded in a queue of a million people who are getting the same
<br>
piece of paper, for one thing).
<br>
<p>Is it because I'm a woman and a American, they think that I'm stupid
<br>
and rich? Or because I'm nonEU, that I'm a criminal? Or because I'm
<br>
simply not from this town, that I'm not to be trusted? Believe it or
<br>
not, these are real attitudes, here. The word: 'extracommunitari',
<br>
which simply means &quot;person from outside of the EU&quot; is almost a slang
<br>
term for criminal. This country is probably not absorbing well the
<br>
millions of immigrants who have entered in the last years, and this
<br>
is one result.
<br>
<p>Germany didn't have the kinds of obstacles that I've encountered
<br>
thus far as an immigrant-nonEU, but then I never tried to work there
<br>
as a permanent employee in a country's national research institute.
<br>
Generally, the current immigration procedures in Italy give the
<br>
U.S.'s INS a good competition for being excessively heavihanded, but
<br>
then, once one is in Italy, and passes through the initial
<br>
processing, then many or most rights are granted to immigrants as
<br>
are those granted to Italian citizens. I don't think that's true in
<br>
Spain, for example. I don't know about Portugal.
<br>
<p>&lt;rant&gt;
<br>
One of the first heavihanded facets of Italy with respect to
<br>
immigrants is the fingerprinting law.  I am not sure what it is
<br>
supposed to help, but I think the idea is for it to feed into an
<br>
EU-wide database of immigrants, so that one can track
<br>
asylum-seekers. I wish that the Italians would look at their own
<br>
actions that result in a large number of Italians emigrating out,
<br>
and add to that their flat birth-rate and their pension scheme
<br>
heading for disaster. *Who* is going to pay those pensioners
<br>
pensions, if not a new generation?? It is the immigrants that are
<br>
having the babies, not the Italians. It is the immigrants who are
<br>
willing to work in the fields and do the dirty jobs that Italians
<br>
don't want to do.
<br>
<p>For the fingerprinting law, I read (Italy: Facts and Figures) that
<br>
52% of Italians support it. I wonder if such a large number would
<br>
support it if they knew what it actually was? The process is not
<br>
mere fingerprint: it is a full fingerprint/palmprint/handprint. Two
<br>
sets, now on file with the Frascati Police; my hands were dripping
<br>
with ink when I finished. Now what was that supposed to prove, I
<br>
wonder? I put it in the same category as the stripping procedure at
<br>
U.S. airports, that is, a large-scale theatre that is supposed to
<br>
make the country's citizen *think* that something is being done to
<br>
solve some people's fears, but a little analysis would show how
<br>
empty that is.
<br>
&lt;/rant&gt;
<br>
<p>However, if you were a government creature, you might try to make a
<br>
little money for the government from the immigrants (who don't often
<br>
pay taxes), which is exactly what Berlusconi's government did.
<br>
<p>Sometime last Fall (not sure when), Berlusconi's government passed a
<br>
law that allowed any of the 3 million illegal people in this country
<br>
to pay 400 euros, fill out some papers, and have a legal permit of
<br>
stay. One million of those followed through, giving the government a
<br>
bit of money in the process. Presently the Questura are only through
<br>
the applicants up to December of last year, so I have several months
<br>
ahead of me in the queue. All of the papers (in the country I think)
<br>
funnel through the Roma Questura. My papers are mixed with them,
<br>
because I'm considered foreigner like them, it doesn't matter that I
<br>
have a legitimate job with a legitimate work visa, it seems. It also
<br>
doesn't seem to matter to the Questura that traveling out of Italy
<br>
is an important and necessary part of my job, so I'm in a position of
<br>
being illegal if I perform my job functions (or even spend time with
<br>
my family).
<br>
<p>The law basically says this:
<br>
<p>If you've started the application, you must remain in Italy while
<br>
it's being processed. (The law also says that they must complete the
<br>
processing in 20 days) If a person goes abroad, and wants to come
<br>
back, then they must start the whole process again to get the
<br>
permesso di soggiorno. If you want to see what the law really says
<br>
go here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.poliziadistato.it/pds/cittadino/stranieri/stranier.htm">http://www.poliziadistato.it/pds/cittadino/stranieri/stranier.htm</a>
<br>
<p>[You can get the document in English, by clicking on the lower part
<br>
of the window on the English button.]
<br>
<p>But Italy is a country where life rarely follows a direct path, so
<br>
one could try this loop: if the police break the law, (which
<br>
they are, by not processing my papers in 20 days), then if I break
<br>
the same law, it doesn't count. The principle is 'factum principis',
<br>
which says that a citizen does not do anything illegal if he/she
<br>
does not respect a law which was not respected first, by the State
<br>
itself.
<br>
<p>OK, enough monologue.
<br>
<p>I've attached below a newsletter regarding more immigration
<br>
information in some southern European countries.

<br>
<p>August 2002
<br>
Volume 9 Number 8
<br>
<p>Spain, Italy, Portugal
<br>
<p>Spain-Morocco. Tensions between Spain and Morocco increased after
<br>
Morocco on July 11,2002 occupied an uninhabited island 200 yards off
<br>
its coast that is claimed by Spain. Spanish special forces stormed
<br>
the islet a week later, and took the six Moroccan soldiers prisoner;
<br>
they later withdrew, leaving the islet uninhabited.
<br>
<p>Morocco said it had set up an &quot;observation post&quot; on the islet to
<br>
deter illegal migration into Europe across the 12-mile strait of
<br>
Gibraltar dividing Spain from Africa and the Mediterranean from the
<br>
Atlantic. Under a 1956 agreement, Spain kept the coastal enclaves of
<br>
Ceuta and Melilla, Spanish autonomous regions, which it has held for
<br>
centuries, as well as several islands offshore. Morocco promised not
<br>
to re-occupy the islet. However, Spain is close to a deal with the
<br>
UK on shared sovereignty over Gibraltar, which has 30,000 residents,
<br>
and analysts speculated that these negotiations prompted the
<br>
Moroccan move on the islet.
<br>
<p>Any Spanish-Morocco agreement will have to deal with the
<br>
phosphate-rich Western Sahara, annexed by Morocco after Spain's
<br>
withdrawal in 1975 but claimed by the Saharawi people represented by
<br>
the Polisario Front.
<br>
<p>Some 250,000 Moroccans live and work legally in Spain, and 1.5
<br>
million more Moroccans pass through Spain every summer on their way
<br>
home from other European countries. Morocco is a major source and
<br>
transit country for migrants headed to Spain and Europe. The
<br>
government says that 13 percent of Morocco's 10.5-million workforce
<br>
are unemployed and Moroccan universities produce thousands of
<br>
graduates considered overqualified for the work available. Morocco
<br>
has relaxed visa rules for Algerians and Tunisians, where
<br>
unemployment is 30 to 35 percent.
<br>
<p>Between January and July 2002, Spain intercepted 5,600 foreigners on
<br>
its coasts.
<br>
<p>Italy. Italy enacted a new immigration law, the Bossi-Fini law, in
<br>
July 2002 that among other things, requires that all non-European
<br>
Union immigrants be fingerprinted and allows the use of naval ships
<br>
to patrol Italian coastlines and to intercept smuggling ships.
<br>
<p>Non-EU foreigners must have contracts from Italian employers before
<br>
their arrival. The law links residence and work permits- a foreign
<br>
worker who loses his job also loses his work permit. There are new
<br>
restrictions on family unification (only children under 18 can join
<br>
families), and on immigrants' access to public housing. The new law
<br>
makes it harder for immigrants to get their pension contributions
<br>
back if they leave Italy before retirement age.
<br>
<p>Penalties for being or employing an illegal migrants are being
<br>
raised, and entering Italy illegally more than once can lead to
<br>
prison terms of up to four years, while smugglers can be punished
<br>
with up to 12 years jail plus a fine of E15,000 for each clandestine
<br>
migrant they bring to Italy.
<br>
<p>Italy's 2002 immigration law was prompted in part by a wave of much
<br>
publicized burglaries, blamed on immigrants, in prosperous northern
<br>
Italy. Illegal immigrants are 20 percent Italian prisoners.
<br>
<p>About 150,000 non-EU workers were hired in 2001, about 20 percent of
<br>
labor force growth. The Italian employers federation, Confindustria,
<br>
said: &quot;Italian industry can't survive without the help of immigrant
<br>
workers.&quot;
<br>
<p>Portugal. Portugal enacted a new immigration law in July 2002 that
<br>
establishes limits on the entry of non-EU foreigners based on
<br>
economic criteria. It favors the entry of skilled foreigners.
<br>
Foreigners who entered Portugal after November 30, 2001 will not be
<br>
able to adjust their status to legal resident. These 30,000 to
<br>
60,000 unauthorized foreigners, many employed in the booming
<br>
construction sector, as Portugal builds stadiums and infrastructure
<br>
to host the 2004 European soccer championships, are to be deported.
<br>
Employers found with undocumented migrants will face higher fines
<br>
and will be liable for the costs of deportation.
<br>
<p>Announcing the new law, Prime Minister Jose Manuel Durao Barroso
<br>
said: &quot;Immigration in Portugal is completely out of control.
<br>
Portugal is a small country, it cannot have its doors wide open,
<br>
there must be limits.&quot;
<br>
<p>A previous law, passed in January 2001, allowed foreigners to apply
<br>
for temporary work and residence papers once they were in Portugal.
<br>
The number of foreigners legally in Portugal almost doubled, rising
<br>
from 220,000 in 2000 to 430,000 in 2002, as 180,000 illegal migrants
<br>
-- many of them from Ukraine and other eastern European countries --
<br>
acquired residency permits in 2001.
<br>
<p>Most foreigners will have to live in Portugal for eight years before
<br>
they receive permanent residence-- five years for those from Brazil
<br>
and Portuguese-speaking countries in Africa.
<br>
<p>&quot;Portugal says immigration up 7.7 pct last year,&quot; Reuters, July 24,
<br>
2002. Gavin Jones, &quot;Right-wing alliance passes controversial
<br>
legislation despite wide opposition from church and employers,&quot;
<br>
Financial Times, July 22, 2002.
