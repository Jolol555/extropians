<p><em>&gt;Seems somewhat similar to koans, a way of attacking the rooted

</em><br>
<p>That's right.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From my (admittedly casual, last 15 yrs) study, the Sufis' quest
<br>
for enlightenment is a self-knowing, overcoming as much as possible
<br>
social conditioning. So they have developed many many methods, of
<br>
which the 'scattering technique' that I described previously, is
<br>
one method.
<br>
<p>Another way to overcome our social conditioning is by using
<br>
multi-layered stories, parables, poetry, which have a new meaning
<br>
each time you read the same one. If you read one and say to yourself
<br>
&quot;huh&quot; ?, then that means that you didn't understand one of the
<br>
messages, but you shifted your mind in a useful new way. (Try
<br>
reading: _Tales of the Dervishes_ by Idries Shah, to see what I
<br>
mean). More about this can be found in _Learning How to Learn_ by
<br>
Idries Shah.
<br>
<p>Another way the Sufis like to shift our thinking patterns is to
<br>
present something as 'ridiculous' (court jesters, clowns,
<br>
tricksters, for example are Sufic). The most famous 'Idiot' (or
<br>
Sage?) is the Mulla Nasrudin, and the stories of his adventures are
<br>
pervasive throughout Sufi schools because they are teaching stories.
<br>
<p>In the Sufi stream, enlightenment can be gained via love, meaning a
<br>
(poetic) love of perfect devotion to a wise Muse. The poets are the
<br>
chief disseminators of Sufi thought (&quot;Under the poet's tongue lies
<br>
the key of treasury&quot; says Nizami, a Persian poet).  Poetry has a
<br>
subsidiary role for the Sufis- they think that it helps to prepare
<br>
the mind, to allow values concepts to flow inwards, as a &quot;bridge&quot;.
<br>
Rumi, one of the greatest poets of Persia, regarded poetry as a
<br>
reflection of the enormous inner reality which he called love, but
<br>
the greatest love he said, is silent and cannot be expressed in
<br>
words. Idries Shah says that &quot;it is not possible to understand Sufi
<br>
poetry unless one is steeped in the imagery and almost unbelievable
<br>
depth of feeling which is cloaked in allegory&quot;.
<br>
<p>The Sufis have given humankind many valuable things. One reason
<br>
people don't hear very much about them is that they feel that their
<br>
function to be a 'nutrient' for society, and to then transmute and
<br>
disappear, leaving altered traces only.
