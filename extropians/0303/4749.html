I recently came across the following article.  Makes a lot of $en$e to me.

<p>JOHN FUND'S POLITICAL DIARY 
<br>
Hit the Road, Jacques 
<br>
Forget &quot;freedom fries.&quot; Punish the French with green cards. 
<br>
<p>Thursday, March 20, 2003 12:01 a.m. EST 
<br>
<p>Congress is none too pleased with France's diplomatic betrayal over Iraq. 
<br>
House restaurants have renamed french fries &quot;freedom fries.&quot; Rep. Ginny 
<br>
Brown-Waite (R., Fla.) has introduced a bill that would fund the repatriation 
<br>
of remains of U.S. servicemen who died in World Wars I or II and were buried 
<br>
in France. Others are boycotts of French (and German) products, or even 
<br>
economic sanctions. 
<br>
<p>There's a better way to punish France. It's time to use immigration laws as 
<br>
an instrument of foreign policy, and Rep. David Dreier (R., Calif.), a 
<br>
respected internationalist who chairs the House Rules Committee, may 
<br>
introduce legislation to that effect.
<br>
<p>Traditional responses to countries with which we are unhappy but not at war, 
<br>
such as raising tariff barriers to their goods, hurt U.S. consumers and 
<br>
violate our own goal of freeing world trade. Sweet reason and visits from a 
<br>
parade of U.S. diplomats clearly haven't produced results. France's desire to 
<br>
humiliate America, along with its longstanding business interests in 
<br>
Iraq--and perhaps fear of what a successful invasion will uncover about 
<br>
French companies and officials in that country's archives--loom larger in 
<br>
Paris's decision making. So perhaps it's time to consider using the 
<br>
immigration lever. The U.S. could creatively use its dynamic culture and 
<br>
economy to get the French and others to consider the costs of their actions. 
<br>
<p>By slightly loosening immigration rules, we could punish France by allowing 
<br>
more of its talented citizens into America. Immigration policy also could be 
<br>
used to open up trade in computers and medical technology and even help 
<br>
toughen patent and trademark protections. 
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p>Each year more than 900,000 foreigners move legally to America. The number is 
<br>
limited by law, and the State Department allocates a certain number of 
<br>
immigration slots per country. No more than 25,620 may enter from any one 
<br>
land in a given year, and a 1965 law bars economic immigrants from entering 
<br>
the country if there are any Americans available and qualified to perform the 
<br>
job the newcomer is seeking. By slightly amending this law, varying the 
<br>
country allocations and the distribution of work permits to specific 
<br>
countries, and indeed particular individuals and professions in those 
<br>
nations, we can use the brain drain as a pinpoint method of sending a message 
<br>
to recalcitrant allies. 
<br>
<p>Several thousand Frenchmen are on a waiting list to immgrate to the U.S. 
<br>
Still others are discouraged from applying by the long list, which can take 
<br>
years to clear. The U.S. Embassy could quietly let out word that we are 
<br>
passing out green cards or work permits to a certain number of French 
<br>
computer experts or civil engineers--or really hit below the belt by 
<br>
targeting French fashion designers and wine makers. Our high-tech and 
<br>
engineering professions could absorb 500 French computer specialists and 
<br>
1,000 civil engineers without seriously affecting U.S. pay scales, but France 
<br>
could ill afford to lose them. 
<br>
<p>What could a Jacques Chirac do to retaliate? Invite Americans to France? And 
<br>
would he really denounce the U.S. for allowing greater numbers of French 
<br>
citizens to trade Boulogne for Baltimore? After all, Mr. Chirac himself likes 
<br>
to talk about the days when he lived in the U.S. in the 1950s and worked both 
<br>
as a chauffeur for a wealthy Texas widow and as a short-order cook at a 
<br>
Howard Johnson's coffee shop.
<br>
<p><p><p><p><p><p><p>This strategy would allow Washington tremendous flexibility. One hundred work 
<br>
permits or green cards could be given out each week, until, say, the Greek 
<br>
government agrees to further crack down on its anti-American terrorist cells. 
<br>
Or until other countries quit tolerating drug exporters. Obviously there need 
<br>
be no official acknowledgment that the increased issuance of green cards is 
<br>
tied to any specific response by any country. But they will know what is 
<br>
happening--and how to stop it. As David Frum of National Review says, &quot;If 
<br>
that doesn't bring them to their knees, do it again!&quot;A supply-side 
<br>
immigration strategy will also give Washington the opportunity to champion 
<br>
human rights and economic freedom in countries that are not officially allied 
<br>
with the U.S. What if strongman President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela doesn't 
<br>
allow a referendum on his continued rule as he promised later this year? 
<br>
Green cards to a certain number of Venezuelans. Does Brazil still refuse to 
<br>
reduce barriers to U.S. goods? Fine--let's invite interested Brazilian 
<br>
executives and professionals. Insufficient democratization in Saudi Arabia? 
<br>
OK, more green cards--for educated men and women.
<br>
<p>Rep. Dreier calls this approach &quot;a positive-sum game for the U.S.&quot; It would 
<br>
also send a clear signal to our errant allies by denying them the skills, 
<br>
services and much of the income of their most prosperous and talented 
<br>
citizens. It reminds the world that America remains the world's most pleasant 
<br>
and prosperous place to live. And it would bring talented, resourceful and 
<br>
hardworking people to live among us and become Americans. 
<br>
<p>The U.S. already has used its fairly open immigration policy to the detriment 
<br>
of communist nations. It attracted most of the talent out of Castro's Cuba. 
<br>
Soviet Jews and dissidents have enriched America, as have countless 
<br>
immigrants from Africa and the Caribbean. Now is the time to exert such 
<br>
subtle pressure on our unruly allies. Against Iraq the U.S. is about to use 
<br>
smart bombs and tanks. Against Osama bin Laden we are deploying a world-wide 
<br>
network of intelligence operatives. But in encouraging better behavior in the 
<br>
Western camp, our most effective instrument of foreign policy just might be 
<br>
the green card.
