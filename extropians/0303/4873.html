</em><br>
<p>It matters how you view someone, that is, whether you
<br>
love them, hate them, or are indifferent to them,
<br>
because ultimately it is your values and the way that
<br>
your emotions interface with them, that determines
<br>
what actions you will take.  I think it's a complete
<br>
myth to suppose that one can be driven by rationality
<br>
alone.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I oppose the punishment of non-punishers; it may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an ESS but I don't think it's a good thing.
</em><br>
<p>You oppose the punishment of non-punishers in general?
<br>
Do you not think that one could easily create a scenario
<br>
in which inflicting punishment on the non-punishers,
<br>
or upon anyone actually, would be the right thing to do?
<br>
<p>Now if we abstract away from any practical situation,
<br>
then I oppose the punishment of *anyone*.  So long as I'm
<br>
sitting fat and comfortable, and no friends or relatives of
<br>
mine have been tortured or murdered by a sadistic dictator,
<br>
then I wish even very evil people well.
<br>
<p>As an example---so that one may understand exactly how
<br>
abstractly I am talking here---suppose that you here and
<br>
now in the year 2003 have three choices with what to do
<br>
with Joseph Stalin, who has (thankfully) been dead 50 years
<br>
and 17 days.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(A) Stalin will get run time in a small cubic centimeter
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;near the orbit of Pluto, where he will have ample
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;time to reflect on his life's accomplishments, his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;victories, and enjoy vodka at a resort on the Black
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sea with his chums (portrayed versions of Beria etc.).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(B) Stalin will continue to not exist.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(C) Stalin will undergo punishment for his hideous crimes:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for each person that he had tortured and who he had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;deliberately murdered, he will be forced to undergo
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;some fraction of their suffering, and the suffering
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the countless families associated with his victims.
<br>
<p>What say you?  (A), (B), or (C)?
<br>
<p>Lee
