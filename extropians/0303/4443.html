<p>It is probably doubtful that evolution split the genomic differences evenly
<br>
between us and the chimpanzees.  It could easily be 4%/1% or 1%/4% depending
<br>
on the selection pressures.  I'd lean more in the direction that humans ended
<br>
up with more of the differences since it would seem that chimps are fairly
<br>
well adapted to environments that existed 5 million years ago while humans
<br>
have clearly gone through one or more population bottlenecks where we had
<br>
to overcome some significant difficulties.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is there solid evidence to suggest that our genome differs more from
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>No evidence that I'm aware of other than that I cite above.  We may know
<br>
a bit more once the chimp genome is done (we can see if there is perhaps
<br>
less genome rearrangement).  I believe that a collection of Asian countries
<br>
have started sequencing the chimp genome so we may know in a few years.
<br>
<p>Its going to be tricky however without the genome of one of those ancestors.
<br>
It might take doing a few other closely related primates to see if we can
<br>
get back to the prototype primate genome and see if we have diverged more
<br>
than some of the other primates.
