</em><br>
<em>&gt; their obesity problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This has all-ready been solved in concept in a

</em><br>
<p>Actually, I think I may have been the one to describe
<br>
the device you mention.  I don't keep a list of all
<br>
posts I've made in my head (yet: my memory has
<br>
presently not been upgraded sufficiently), but I know
<br>
I've been thinking about a device like that for quite
<br>
a while, before I even heard of the Extropians.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A cheap, simple implant anyone could get.  Ideally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it would be even better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if such a device could power external electronic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devices.  
</em><br>
<p>It'd produce miniscule amounts of power - but then,
<br>
many devices only need miniscule amounts of power.
<br>
So, no using yourself as a battery for an electric
<br>
car, but you could maybe use this to run (or at least
<br>
trickle-recharge, when it's not actively being used) a
<br>
PDA.  But the first versions would probably have very
<br>
low efficiency in power conversion, and as such could
<br>
not generate any usable amount of energy - though what
<br>
energy they do generate would have to be disposed of
<br>
somehow (possibly via an inductive loop, the second
<br>
part of which is placed on or near the skin near the
<br>
implant every day, maybe week, to activate the
<br>
discharge so as to avoid needing wires or sockets
<br>
permanently sticking out of the skin).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I found this idea quite fascinating when it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proposed on this list a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; months back, it didn't seem to generate much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest, but it's a great idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMHO.  In my own limited research into the topic I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found a class of fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells called 'Microbial Fuel Cells' which do just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this, and they are being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researched to power robots called 'Gastrobots' since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they function on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'stomach'  
</em><br>
<p>Actually, MFCs seem to run on starch.  You'd need to
<br>
adapt them to run on glucose.  But I see no reason it
<br>
could not be done in theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are a heck of a lot of intelligent electrical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering, physics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and chemistry people on this list, perhaps a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calloborative effort could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring such a device into existence.
</em><br>
<p>The electrical bits of this, including controllers,
<br>
would be relatively easy.  It's the biochemical parts
<br>
that present the biggest challenge.  But the biggest
<br>
challenge, at least to us, would seem to be the
<br>
practical matters of actually doing it.
<br>
<p>For starters: assuming we agreed on an enzyme or
<br>
controllable microbe that one could expose to glucose
<br>
in the blood stream, how would we manufacture a
<br>
prototype?  How would we test it?  (Yes, it's great to
<br>
say, &quot;in theory, one could do animal testing&quot;.  Does
<br>
any of us have the appropriate equipment or licenses
<br>
for this?  If not, how could we obtain such?)
<br>
Granted, one could start up a business around this
<br>
product alone, so that presents one possible source of
<br>
funding (VCs).  But that'll only open up to those who
<br>
at least sound like they know how to do what they wish
<br>
to do...
