<p>### I wonder if this is a rational position, or an emotionally based
<br>
one. The following two links point to some evidence that altruistic
<br>
punishment is a part of an evolutionary stable strategy, built into the
<br>
minds of most humans:
<br>
<p><a href="http://bostonreview.mit.edu/BR23.6/bowles.html">http://bostonreview.mit.edu/BR23.6/bowles.html</a>
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v415/n6868/full/415137a_r.html">http://www.nature.com/cgi-taf/DynaPage.taf?file=/nature/journal/v415/n6868/full/415137a_r.html</a>
<br>
<p>(the second link might require a subscription to Nature. I can send a
<br>
copy to those who request it)
<br>
<p>In the very long run, maintenance of stable societies made of
<br>
potentially immortal persons is probably possible using strictly
<br>
rational reasoning. If your attention-span is capable of encompassing
<br>
very long time spans, you will be able to act according to your
<br>
interests, and this will include cooperation, as well as discouragement
<br>
of non-cooperation. Since a failure to discourage non-cooperation can in
<br>
some cases bring about significant losses, it has to be discouraged as
<br>
well, as a second-order consideration. Shirking a duty to punish a
<br>
cheater puts a burden on other participants in the game, and is
<br>
second-order cheating, calling for second-order punishment. A concept
<br>
easy to grasp for a mind looking far forward, without the need for the
<br>
emotional crutches that we rely on. 
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the emphemeral creatures that we are, such sustained
<br>
rational actions were not possible in the EEA. Instead, common
<br>
hard-wired responses developed, probably through group selection, with
<br>
an innate tendency to seek revenge, and, punish and exclude those who
<br>
fail to seek revenge (also derided as &quot;walk-overs&quot;, doves, peaceniks,
<br>
etc.).
<br>
<p>I agree that the urge to seek revenge and the scorn for those who don't
<br>
share this thirst, are dark feelings, but I wouldn't unequivocally
<br>
condemn them. On one hand, hopefully humans will be able to reconstruct
<br>
themselves to survive without them, reducing the risk of useless
<br>
vendettas, chauvinism, and other forms of tribalism, caused by obsolete
<br>
calibration of the hard-wired systems. On the other hand, we will need
<br>
to use some parts of these hardwired strategies in a reasoned way, as we
<br>
will still need to act against opposing forces, dispassionately,
<br>
efficiently, relentlessly, to improve long-term cooperation and survival
<br>
outcomes of cooperators.  A calm justice.
<br>
<p>It's interesting to think about the programming parameters that will
<br>
need to be entered into our decision systems. To achieve maximum
<br>
survival, you might need to adjust the tendency to reciprocate (the
<br>
trigger-happiness) according to the reliability of information available
<br>
(the more reliable information over many iterations, the less need to
<br>
shoot at the first defection), general level of risk (low-risk, low
<br>
response), and certainly many other elements. Very, very interesting.
