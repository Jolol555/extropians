<p>
Please take a look at the brand new Transhumanity site:
<br>
<a href="http://www.transhumanism.com/">http://www.transhumanism.com/</a>
<br>
Thanks to the work of our web team, the magazine has now lots of new features:
<br>
<p>Our new Content Management System (CMS) based on pmachine (www.pmachine.com) is now in use. You can hardly see any difference, but just about everything changed: Transhumanity has now much more advanced and robust features, including those listed below: 
<br>
<p>- We have re-implemented the comments feature under the CMS. Now there is a very easy way to view the comments of other readers and post your own. 
<br>
<p>- Four RSS/XML feeds are now provided: announcements.xml, articles.xml, news.xml and index.xml (contains all the entries). The RSS/XML feeds permit, for example, using a news aggregator to read summary of latest entries at Transhumanity. 
<br>
<p>- There is now a register/login system. While you can browse and use the site without being logged, we wish to encourage all readers to register. This permits for example posting comments by using your predefined username, and we will soon implement other personalized services. 
<br>
<p>- The CMS has a built-in mailing list management system. You can subscribe to the mailing list (you can do it while registering or later by editing your profile) to be notified via email of new material on Transhumanity. If you already subscribe to the Transhumanity Yahoogroup you do not need changing anything immediately, as all entries are also posted there. You may switch to the new system if you prefer so, otherwise you can continue using the Transhumanity Yahoogroup (the &quot;digest problem&quot; has been solved). 
<br>
<p>We will soon implement a more complete description of the system and an online help facility. We would appreciate it if you could let us know any problem that you might encounter, or just your opinions on the site.
<br>
<p>We have a few more positions open on the team, and look forward to contact motivated volunteers able to contribute a few hours per week. If you are interested, please take a look at:
