<p>You have a *chance* of dying.  You could, totally by

accident, wind up doing the right thing anyway.  This
<br>
is not the same thing as guaranteed death.

<p>Yes.  Build an AI that you can trust, even if it
<br>
quickly goes beyond your control.  This is not exactly
<br>
the same thing as FAI, since it allows for things like
<br>
uploads of human beings: the original human was never
<br>
completely by your design (unless, of course, it's you
<br>
yourself, but that screws everybody else from that
<br>
perspective), but if you can trust someone else to be
<br>
gifted with the capabilities that an AI would have...
