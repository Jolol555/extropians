<em>&gt; From: &quot;Hal Finney&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Re:whuffie%20estimate%20by%20popnicity%20vs%20snorellation">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;

<em>&gt; X-Mailer: YaBB
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I like the idea of judging posts, although most threads have such a short     
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lifetime that it might be more work than it is worth.                         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One thing I just tried:  I &quot;applaud&quot;ed Spike, and his positive score          
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went up from 6 to 7.  I then just tried it again, and the BBS interface       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game me a warning saying that I could not repeat an action within the         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait time, and that the wait time was 6 hours!                                
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The implication is that one can repeatedly applaud or smite someone           
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as long as you wait 6 hours between actions.  These scores we are seeing      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may include multiple entries from a relatively small number of people         
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who repeatedly applaud or smite certain targets.  It's even conceivable       
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that someone could write a script to automatically redo the action every      
</em><br>
<em>&gt; six hours, giving somone 100 positive or negative points a month.             
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
### It is quite likely that this indeed what happened, since the
<br>
distribution of the scores is so uneven. The majority of posters have
<br>
little or no karma, either good or bad, which reflects the baseline
<br>
random smitting/praise by readers, but some persons were selected for
<br>
special treatment (Lee, or me, which is understandable in view of our
<br>
combative style and sometimes strident assertions, and Spike, which is
<br>
totally baffling - who could hate Spike?).
<br>
<p>One obvious solution is to give the reader an option to score a post
<br>
only once, although it would mean keeping a permanent record of the
<br>
votes (or would it? maybe the script could separately keep track of
<br>
voting and the total score - with more than a few voters it would be
<br>
impossible to find out the direction of the vote of any single person).
<br>
<p>This brings me to the differing values of dark and white whuffie - votes
<br>
could be cast confidentially or openly, giving great opportunities to
<br>
the discerning sociologist for analyzing ostensible trends and the dark
<br>
undercurrents. Also, a finer gradation of the value of posts, as Spike
<br>
notes, would be useful - to tell the reader whether the post is boring,
<br>
smart, stupid, or the very paragon of wisdom and benevolence. A scale
<br>
with more points (very, mainly, somewhat, not at all) would help, too.
<br>
Finally, tracking the source of whuffie, whether coming from persons you
<br>
like or not (or persons generally liked or not) would allow every user
<br>
to attach subjective weights to the unfiltered measures.
<br>
<p>Sounds like a major programming undertaking.
