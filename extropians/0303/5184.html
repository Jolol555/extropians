Greg writes (should we change this thread to &quot;Redefining Force&quot;?  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [Lee writes]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you maintain that billboards on private
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; property that happen to be within sight of highways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (just as distant mountains are within sight), should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be restricted in what appears on them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (I'm *not* yet taking a stance here.  I just want you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to clarify your position by considering a *perhaps*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; parallel question.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why is one forced to look at people one considers ugly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and is not forced (I guess!?) to look at unappealing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; billboards?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point so far is merely to point out that an economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity such as putting up a billboard is an act of force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - it forces me (and others) to see it.
</em><br>
<p>This is quite a claim, pregnant with implications.
<br>
To pursue my fanciful analogy a bit, then I am to
<br>
understand that I am being forced to look at ugly
<br>
or crippled people as well?  After all, they walk
<br>
down the street and &quot;intrude&quot; on my visual space
<br>
much as billboards do.
<br>
<p>Now I will admit that backyard astronomers are forced
<br>
to look through city lights and bad air to see the
<br>
stars, if they don't want to drive somewhere, and I
<br>
must admit that city dwellers are forced to breathe
<br>
the same polluted air if they don't want to move
<br>
elsewhere.
<br>
<p>(But note that there are two big &quot;if's&quot; in my examples.)
<br>
<p>I think that you should reconsider your very broad
<br>
usage of &quot;force&quot; (and, I'm guessing &quot;violence&quot; in the
<br>
main thread).  After all, where do you stop?  No
<br>
matter what kind of an effect one kind of matter
<br>
has on another, according to your usage, it seems
<br>
the former is using force on the latter.
<br>
<p>Now while that might be okay for physics  ;-)  it
<br>
still sounds like a bad idea for law or philosophy.
<br>
It would mean, for example, that since you are 
<br>
forcing me to read your email subject lines, and
<br>
your name to the left of them, then perhaps whatever
<br>
force I use to stop you from doing this is in the
<br>
same basic category.  And *you* were the one who
<br>
started using force after all!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like I said, whether a particular exercise of force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is good or bad is an aesthetic judgment.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I understood.  And you're right; but I'd say 
<br>
instead that it depends on one's value system.
<br>
However, I think that we are saying the same thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It may depend upon the characteristics of the billboard.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here in Florida billboards are almost everywhere - huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and loud.  I personally don't usually like them, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough people who think similarly have exerted THEIR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force to pass laws against them, thus forcing advertisers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to seek some new medium.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  As it stands, local communities still have the
<br>
legal right to pass ordinances against a great many
<br>
things---anything (in the U.S., that is) at least that
<br>
does not violate the Constitution, the supreme law of
<br>
the land.  If I had my way, they could pass laws against
<br>
*whatever* they pleased that did not strictly violate
<br>
the constitution, including, for example, abortion, or
<br>
other laws favoring infanticide.  But few agree with me
<br>
there:  the honest ones will disagree by claiming that
<br>
a kind of utilitarianism supports their position that
<br>
the federal government should disallow such local freedom,
<br>
the dishonest ones will twist the constitution until it
<br>
says whatever they want.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the advertisers had put up enough well-designed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billboards *supporting* billboards, maybe they could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have forced enough people to agree to prevent the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law from being passed. :)
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  8^D  They should have used their ammunition
<br>
wisely while they still had it!
<br>
<p>But more seriously, note your egregious use of the word
<br>
&quot;force&quot; yet again;  no one really forces anyone else to
<br>
agree with them in a free country.
<br>
<p>Lee
