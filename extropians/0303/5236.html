Gts opined:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;FOX gives me an adrenaline rush, sometimes to the point where I can't stand
<br>
it anymore. I might have liked it back in the 80's, when I was a
<br>
20-something hard-line Reaganite who thought he had just &quot;seen the light&quot;...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><p>I like FoxNews the best, and find that in the &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; realm; 
<br>
Fox/Republicans are spot-on. Spot-off is CNN, and typically the least 
<br>
pro-American of the &quot;news channels.&quot; MsNBC is rather good, in that it seems 
<br>
incisive; biting in the way Fox is, but less personality-dependent. The 
<br>
regular news orgs in the US, ABC, NBC, CBS, I rarely view at all, anymore. 
<br>
<p>Peter Jennings personal relationship with PLO mouthpiece Hanan Ashwari is 
<br>
comparatively well-known. CBS is reflects Din Hewett's and Dan Rather's 
<br>
impatience. NBC relects Tom Brokaw's mumble-ability. I switch to FoxNews-and 
<br>
MsNbc, and view online news sources like the Washington Post and Washington 
<br>
Times. For news analysis (tell me what to think!!!) I enjoy the National 
<br>
Review, Weekly Standard, occasionally, The New Republic and the like.
