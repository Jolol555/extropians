<em>&gt; (Hal Finney &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20DOWN%20&amp;%20OUT%20IN%20THE%20MAGIC%20KINGDOM">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There's a review of Cory Doctorow's novel in the New York Times at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/books/review/009ANTRIT.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/books/review/009ANTRIT.html</a>.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as &quot;whuffie&quot;, we do have a variant via the web interface to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list at <a href="http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67">http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67</a>.  As you read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the messages you see not only a picture that the poster has chosen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associate with himself (a very big one for Lee Crocker!), but also the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poster's &quot;karma&quot; score.  Anyone can vote positively or negatively for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another person when reading their posts.  The postive and negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values are apparently totalled separately.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, I'm a graphics guy; I don't like low-res tiny images :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The karma scores seem somewhat counter-intuitive.  It's not surprising
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to see Anders Sandburg at +235/-1 or Eliezer Yudkowski at +123/-1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amara Graps seems to be the champion at +273/-4.  And apparently Harvey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Newstrom hasn't gotten anybody mad at him, at +157/-0.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But Spike at +4/-213?  That seems a little harsh.  Lee Corbin at +4/-305,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee Crocker at +1/-52, John Clark at +5/-224?  These are some of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people I find most informative and stimulating.  Rafal Smigrodzki at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; +1/-296, Robert Bradbury at +17/-187?  I don't really get it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I guess the big picture does evince a /bit/ of ego...
<br>
But Spike?  Who has Spike every annoyed, except possibly a few
<br>
folks utterly devoid of a sense of humor?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hopefully the database is keeping track of who is voting for whom.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be interesting to use the data in more sophisticated ways,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as looking for clustering effects.  Maybe all those negative karma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points were applied by a relatively self-contained group.  It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting to see more about how the scores have evolved.
</em><br>
<p>I'll go ahead and give away a device of Doctorow's that Michael only
<br>
alluded to, but that shouldn't really detract from the story: the
<br>
people have both &quot;left-handed&quot; and &quot;right-handed&quot; whuffie; the former
<br>
is the esteem of those folks who are unknown or not particularly
<br>
esteemed to you; the latter is the esteem of those to whom you have
<br>
accorded esteem.  It would be interesting to see if that -52 is from
<br>
people whose opinions I don't care about, or if I'm really ticking off
<br>
my intended audience.
