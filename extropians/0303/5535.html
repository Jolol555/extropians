<p>One problem here is in discerning the limits of `political' as a framing
<br>
adjective. Feminist critique, for all its excesses, has shown convincingly
<br>
the ideological forces skewing, constraining, even largely *creating* the
<br>
ways most men and women in the Western 1950s, say, understood what it is to
<br>
be a male or a female human. This construction was largely invisible to
<br>
those involved; it was *just how the world is*. If you were a black man or
<br>
woman, you had further layers of ideological shaping simultaneously imposed
<br>
*on* you and internalized *inside* you. That's ideology: not what political
<br>
opinions you happen to find fashionable, but the immense social
<br>
constraining and enabling powers of discourse.
<br>
<p>Of what?
<br>
<p>Oh well, here's a bit from THE ARCHITECTURE OF BABEL. I probably posted
<br>
this last time around, but it might provide some chewy nuggets:
<br>
<p>============
<br>
<p>A discourse, in general terms, is a kind of local communication field which
<br>
arises in the unexplored linguistic gap between the realms of langue and
<br>
parole. Discourse, that is, has some of the characteristics of a language
<br>
system, as a competence at a high level of abstraction, which yet arises
<br>
out of the performative speech acts which mediate the day-to-day exercise
<br>
of power and knowledge. Perhaps each discourse, in as much as it can be
<br>
specified, is a slice through the polysemous jangle-jungle of conflicting
<br>
meanings which become attached (through conflicts, and the pressure of
<br>
novelties of every kind) to each human utterance or inscription.
<br>
<p>Let us look briefly at some of the typical moves in that variety of
<br>
discourse theory which is an offshoot of Althusserian Marxism, as discussed
<br>
in a survey by Diane Macdonell (1986). 
<br>
<p>Typically enough, Macdonell's attempted redemption of Althusser ascribes
<br>
the relativist, constructivist commonplaces of discourse theory to what she
<br>
calls his `radical breakthrough' (p. 13). Suddenly, after the 1969 essay
<br>
`Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses', intellectuals in the French
<br>
Communist Party were urged to see that superstructural social phenomena
<br>
like families, religions and education (now `ISAs') might be as causally
<br>
significant as brute `relations of economic production'. Is it unfair of me
<br>
to belittle  Althusser's discovery as a commonplace? Has not theory, under
<br>
his influence, opened our understanding of the self to unprecedented voids
<br>
of uncertainty? Not altogether unprecedented. Consider that much-debunked
<br>
falsificationist Karl Popper, on the topic of subjectivity: 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It seems to me of considerable importance that we are not born as
<br>
selves, but that we have to learn that we are selves; in fact we have to
<br>
learn to be selves....
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I suggest that a consciousness of self begins to develop through the
<br>
medium of other persons: just as we learn to see ourselves in a mirror, so
<br>
the child becomes conscious of himself by sensing his reflection in the
<br>
mirror of other people's consciousness of himself.&quot; (Popper and Eccles,
<br>
1977, pp. 109-10)
<br>
<p>Popper's figure of the mirror is not a sly appropriation of one of theory's
<br>
favorite tropes. As he points out, it goes back at least to Adam Smith
<br>
(1759: The Theory of Moral Sentiments) who `puts forward the idea that
<br>
society is a &quot;mirror&quot; which enables the individual to see and to &quot;think of
<br>
his own character, of the propriety or demerit of his own sentiments and
<br>
conduct, of the beauty or deformity of his own mind&quot;, which suggests that
<br>
if it were &quot;possible that a human creature could grow up to manhood in some
<br>
solitary place, without any communication with his own species&quot; then he
<br>
could not develop a self' (cited in Popper and Eccles, p. 111). 
<br>
<p>While not precisely gleaming with dark Lacanian opacity, this bourgeois
<br>
classic is not very far from the celebrated entry via Alice's Looking Glass
<br>
to the Symbolic Order, and Althusser's construction of subjecthood via the
<br>
process of `hailing' or `interpellation' by another. 
<br>
<p>The difference, of course, lies in the sustained Althusserian attack on any
<br>
`human nature' which might be considered necessary to underpin the
<br>
effectiveness of any process of interpellation. As Terry Eagleton says, it
<br>
is ineffective to baptize a badger (Eagleton, 1983, p. 118; he is
<br>
discussing Austin and illocutionary acts). In much the same way, it is also
<br>
ineffective to interpellate a chair, or even a computer (although often
<br>
enough I find myself doing so). Althusser, of course, was aware of this
<br>
flaw in his case and attempted to correct it by what seems to me
<br>
self-evidently a vacuous re-definition:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[I]deology hails or interpellates individuals as subjects. As
<br>
ideology is eternal, I must now suppress the temporal form in which I have
<br>
presented the functioning of ideology, and say: ideology has always-already
<br>
interpellated individuals as subjects, which amounts to making it clear
<br>
that individuals are always-already interpellated by ideology as subjects,
<br>
which necessarily leads us to one last proposition: individuals are
<br>
always-already subjects.&quot; (Althusser, 1984, pp. 49-50)
<br>
<p>The sole sense which can be made of this - Althusser says it `might seem
<br>
paradoxical' (p. 50), and he is right - is that individuals are genetically
<br>
predisposed to take the imprint of culture. We are `primed' to be
<br>
interpellated. Now as it happens (it could have been otherwise; we might
<br>
have been social insects) the kind of pre-formation this is lends itself to
<br>
the experience of inner consciousness, self-motivation, whether this be
<br>
valorized as `individual initiative' or stigmatized as `original sin',
<br>
`bourgeois illusion', or the clamor of Maya.
<br>

<br>
<p>That's obviously not intended as a substantive reply to either Hal or Lee,
<br>
but as a hint of where one might need to look for further elaborated
<br>
discussions.
