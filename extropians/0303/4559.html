<br>
<p>I am communicating with you only because I believe this is a matter of
<br>
life 
<br>
or death.
<br>
<p>This is a warning of a possible near term pandemic which may be highly
<br>
lethal 
<br>
and result in serious disruption of civil order and normal daily life.
<br>
As 
<br>
most of you probably know from news reports there has been an unusual 
<br>
communicable form of &quot;pneumonia&quot; which does not respond to any
<br>
treatment 
<br>
currently available including antivirals and antibiotics. 
<br>
<p>What you may not know is that the media is severely (in my opinion) 
<br>
underreporting the gravity of the situation in general, and the
<br>
severity of 
<br>
this illness in particular. I first became aware of this problem about
<br>
6 
<br>
months ago when reports came out of China that a new flu had emerged
<br>
and the 
<br>
local population was &quot;overreacting&quot; according to the Chinese
<br>
government. One 
<br>
of my Internet medical colleagues in China advised me that the disease
<br>
was 
<br>
quite serious, virulently communicable (had failed containment using
<br>
standard 
<br>
Universal Precautions and cloth and disposable surgical masks). I was
<br>
also 
<br>
told that heath care workers were heavily affected and that draconian 
<br>
containment measures were being used in the province where the disease
<br>
began. 
<br>
I was also told that it was *rumored* that the area where the epidemic
<br>
began 
<br>
was in proximity to military installations involved in defensive 
<br>
nuclear-chemical-biological (NBC) research. Shortly afterward, he
<br>
died, 
<br>
possibly of the new illness. His last message indicated that all
<br>
attempts he 
<br>
knew of (i.e., civilian) to isolate the etiologic agent responsible
<br>
for the 
<br>
disease in China had failed. In short, it did not appear to be an
<br>
influenza, 
<br>
although the province where it originated is in the heart of the world
<br>
influenza generation zone (which, BTW, is in China).
<br>
<p>On 15 March, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued an alert and
<br>
gave the 
<br>
illness a name: SARS, or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome. My
<br>
contacts in 
<br>
other areas of epidemiology and medicine have informed me that the CDC
<br>
has 
<br>
also so far failed completely to characterize the etiologic agent for
<br>
SARS.
<br>
<p>Many of you will also note that I relocated to a remote, isolated area
<br>
in 
<br>
September of this year. Some of you may have wondered why. Now, you
<br>
know part 
<br>
of the reason and Dave Pizer's comment about my post being &quot;almost
<br>
scary&quot; can 
<br>
be put into perspective. As a sidebar, unfortunately, I currently work
<br>
at a 
<br>
facility that services travelers and tourists, so, unless my timing is
<br>
flawless in the face of a US epidemic of SARS, all my precautions may
<br>
have 
<br>
been futile. 
<br>
<p>Several things are clear:
<br>
<p>1) SARS patients who require hospitalization do not seem to improve
<br>
and those 
<br>
who become ventilator dependent remain so. It is not known how many
<br>
people 
<br>
recover from the illness who do not reach hospital, but in well
<br>
nourished 
<br>
urban populations it appears that the mortality rate may be as high
<br>
10%-20%.
<br>
<p>2) SARS is *extremely* infectious; those physicians treating it in
<br>
Hong Kong 
<br>
report that it is about as infectious as influenza. So that you can 
<br>
understand the gravity of this statement this would mean that SARS is
<br>
more 
<br>
infectious than Ebola or the other hemorrhagic fevers and would
<br>
require the 
<br>
highest level of biosafety containment for handling in the laboratory.
<br>
*For 
<br>
practical purposes it means that complete civilian protection can best
<br>
be 
<br>
achieved by complete isolation until the epidemic is over. * Masks 
<br>
(respiratory) and conjunctival protection (eye shields) coupled with
<br>
gloves 
<br>
will probably provide a significant degree of protection against
<br>
casual 
<br>
exposure. A principal purpose of the gloves is to remind you not to
<br>
touch 
<br>
your face. However, these methods of protection will likely fail if
<br>
contact 
<br>
with infected person(s) is prolonged in indoor or contained spaces
<br>
(homes, 
<br>
vehicles, aircraft, etc.).
<br>
<p>3) SARS is likely to spread rapidly and public health officials are
<br>
likely to 
<br>
react too slowly to contain it. Only draconian measures would allow
<br>
any 
<br>
significant degree of protection and these measures are likely to be
<br>
so 
<br>
severe that normal commerce and travel would be severely or completely
<br>
disrupted. SARS may well behave much like the 1918 Flu. For an
<br>
excellent and 
<br>
comprehensive review of this pandemic I highly recommend Gina Kolata's
<br>
FLU: 
<br>
THE GREAT INFLUENZA PANDEMIC OF 1918 AND THE SEARCH OF THE AGENT THAT
<br>
CAUSED 
<br>
IT (ISBN: 0374157065
<br>
Publisher: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, LLC). Used copies are available
<br>
from 
<br>
bookfinder.com for as little as $1.00 (US). The 1918 Flu killed more
<br>
people 
<br>
than W.W.I. Estimates for deaths in the US are as high as 18 million.
<br>
<p>4) I suggest that if you have not done so already, you stockpile
<br>
emergency 
<br>
food, water, and minimal protective equipment for you and your loved
<br>
ones. It 
<br>
is impossible to be comprehensive here, but other measures such as
<br>
having 
<br>
bleach and dispensing equipment available for disinfection of surfaces
<br>
should 
<br>
you have to care for someone infected with SARS should also be
<br>
undertaken 
<br>
Many websites for disaster and NBC preparedness exist, and many of
<br>
these sell 
<br>
supplies which may be useful. Frankly, these are supplies you should
<br>
*all* 
<br>
have in any event as a routine part of preparedness for life. *Anyone 
<br>
seriously concerned about their survival should have these kinds of 
<br>
preparations in place. * Survival Unlimited.com is one such website.
<br>
There 
<br>
are many others.
<br>
<p>5) The elderly and immunocompromised appear to be particularly hard
<br>
hit by 
<br>
SARS and appear to constitute a disproportinate number of those who've
<br>
died.
<br>
<p>6) I emphasize that media coverage is not accurately reflecting the
<br>
severity 
<br>
of the disease or the extent of SARS in China, although the media is 
<br>
beginning to report that SARS &quot;is of concern to healthcare agencies.&quot;
<br>
<p>7) Those involved in healthcare, cryonics care, and those who deal
<br>
with 
<br>
tourists (freeway related businesses, tourist centers, and
<br>
hotels/motels) are 
<br>
IMHO likely to be at very high risk of exposure to the initial wave of
<br>
infection with SARS should it become epidemic in the United States and
<br>
Europe. A disproportinate number of sentinel provincial Chinese cases
<br>
were in 
<br>
hoteliers and shopkeepers at trade hubs. If you are involved in such a
<br>
business it would probably be wise to cease operation (where possible)
<br>
at 
<br>
such time as the first cases are reported in your country or region of
<br>
your 
<br>
country.
<br>
<p>Healthcare and cryonics workers should acquire active full-head HEPA 
<br>
protection for all staff and impermeable full-body protective suits.
<br>
In the 
<br>
case of cryonics personnel, Standby staff who deal with the patient
<br>
while 
<br>
alive will be at very high risk. Volunteers for these high risk
<br>
positions 
<br>
should be sought at the earliest opportunity and training to minimize
<br>
the 
<br>
risk of SARS transmission (using influenza as a model) should begin at
<br>
once.
<br>
<p>Cryonics organization should also, in my opinion, modify handling and 
<br>
operative procedures to deal with this illness. The external surfaces
<br>
of all 
<br>
patients who arrive should be scrubbed with detergent and 2% sodium 
<br>
hypochlorite.
<br>
<p>Finally, impending war is likely to provide a fertile opportunity for
<br>
rapid 
<br>
spread of SARS since it mandates movement of manpower and material
<br>
across 
<br>
multiple borders even the presence of disease, concentrates people in 
<br>
barracks and shelters, and results in immunocompromise from stress
<br>
(even in 
<br>
healthy and well nourished soldiers and civilians) from increased 
<br>
glucocorticoid secretion. War is the handmaiden of epidemic disease
<br>
and in 
<br>
this case the timing could not be worse in my opinion.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your consideration of this message. The communication
<br>
from Tom 
<br>
Buckley, as posted to the Critical Care Medicine Forum (CCM-L), is
<br>
reproduced 
<br>
below.
<br>
<p>Mike Darwin
<br>
<p><p>The implications of SARS for the cryonics community are overwhelming. 
<br>
<p>I will close this message with a communication from Tom Buckley, an 
<br>
Intensivist in Hong Kong. Tom's is a superb physician and Intensivist
<br>
and his 
<br>
communication below should give you snap shot of what is happening in
<br>
a 
<br>
major, highly sophisticated medical center in Hong Kong.
<br>
<p>Dear All,
<br>
<p>I have not read all of the below because we seem to be close too or
<br>
are the
<br>
centre of this form of atypical pneumonia.
<br>
<p>So just a brief summary of our experience.
<br>
<p>Male arrives on the medical ward having been admitted thru A &amp; E.
<br>
Other
<br>
patients and STAFF start to develop symptoms - fever, headache, dry
<br>
cough.
<br>
<p>Unresponsive to various combinations of cefotaxime, chlarithromycin,
<br>
levofloxacin, doxyclycline and Tamiflu.  All microbiology is NEGATIVE
<br>
(after
<br>
one week).
<br>
<p>Physicians have started patients on ribovarin and steroids.
<br>
<p>As of yesterday there were 64 patients with &quot;atypical pneumonia&quot; in
<br>
the
<br>
hospital - a large number of whom are staff.
<br>
<p>Patient visitors, medical consultation staff, medical students
<br>
visiting
<br>
patients have all developed symptoms and to a large degree CXR signs.
<br>
<p>While most of our cases revolve around the patient admitted to the
<br>
medical
<br>
ward we have admitted (to ICU) another patient from another hospital
<br>
with
<br>
atypical pneumonia.
<br>
<p>In ICU we have twelve patients admitted so far
<br>
<p>Five are ventilated. Seven breathing spontaneously but very oxygen
<br>
dependent.
<br>
<p>My impressions
<br>
CXR reveal progressive bilateral infiltrates starting at the bases.
<br>
Patients invariably have a low WCC and maybe thrombocytopenic.
<br>
Patients invariably have an elevated CPK.  No ECG changes and Troponin
<br>
T
<br>
negative.  Post mortem on an Indonesian maid (not in our hospital)
<br>
showed
<br>
evidence of ARDS and myocarditis.
<br>
<p>So far 2-3 of our older patients with chronic disease have
<br>
deteriorated
<br>
fastest.  Medical staff - younger and fitter have faired better.
<br>
Their
<br>
radiological findings have deteriorated in all but one case.
<br>
<p>We receive 2-3 admissions per day.  So far no-one has shown any
<br>
improvement.
<br>
Once intubated however they remain relatively static but very oxygen
<br>
and
<br>
PEEP dependent.  Those ventilated have solid lungs.  Interestingly one
<br>
patient developed a pneumothorax on the medical ward and after chest
<br>
drain
<br>
and re-expansion his pneumonia involves only the side without a chest
<br>
drain.
<br>
Another patient (ventilated) has developed surgical emphysema.
<br>
<p>ICU is now closed for all but atypical pneumonias.  All our other
<br>
&quot;clean
<br>
cases&quot; have been transferred to other ICUs.  All elective surgery is
<br>
being
<br>
cancelled and wards are being closed and evacuated. Al ambulances are
<br>
being
<br>
diverted.  
<br>
<p>We are taking strictest possible isolation procedures available to us
<br>
including hand washing, gloves, gowns, N95 masks and visors.
<br>
<p>Masks are worn throughout the hospital.
<br>
Staff are not going home to children.
<br>
<p><p>Please take the warning below seriously.  My impression is that even
<br>
with
<br>
minimal contact with an infected person people have been becoming ill.
<br>
<p>Staff morale in ICU is high but If ICU staff start developing symptoms
<br>
then
<br>
this is a big problem as we have instituted isolation procedures
<br>
earliest.
<br>
<p>Other hospitals in Hong Kong are admitting sporadic cases.
<br>
<p>I am off to a noon update.
<br>
<p>Any suggestions will be gratefully received.
