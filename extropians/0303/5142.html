<p>
&quot;Four hundred years ago, Francis Bacon could see clearly enough the need to
<br>
move beyond idolatry of tribes. He suggested we think of ourselves as
<br>
citizens of the Human Republic. Yet that notion has practically disappeared.
<br>
That meme cannot hang on amidst the near universal colonization of human
<br>
minds by nationalisms.&quot;
<br>
<p>Lets be fair here and compare *types* of tribalism.  When some nationalisms
<br>
include such memes as murder, oppression, and torture of political
<br>
dissenters, and are opposed idealogically to human progress and the general
<br>
increase in the standard of living, embrace genocide, are west hating
<br>
racists and want nothing less the destruction of freedom, progress, and
<br>
modern civlization, it is easy to understand why one should prefer
<br>
*tribalism* that embraces the value of human life, values free speech,
<br>
progress, rule of law, representative governments, and objectively makes the
<br>
lives better of all its tribal members.
<br>
<p>Yes, the US and the democratic market based western nations are
<br>
*tribalistic* in that they value there way of life over the alternative
<br>
presented by fanatical islam and murderous tyrant dictators of oppression,
<br>
enslavement, and murder.
<br>
<p>To simply discount all forms of *tribalism* because they are tribalism is
<br>
absurd, and ignores the fact that many are actually a heck of a lot worse
<br>
than other forms.  I invite you to imagine a *world* where the strongest
<br>
power in the world is any one of the following
<br>
<p>despotic communist dictators
<br>
murderous oppressive theocracy
<br>
Saddam Hussain
<br>
<p>And then compare that world to the one in which the strongest world power is
<br>
a democratic constitutional republic which embraces (albiet tribalistically)
<br>
such values as free speech, rule of law, and individual civil liberties, in
<br>
*at least* orders of magnitude greater levels than any of the other systems
<br>
out there.
<br>
<p>In short, lets bring everybody up to a better form of tribalism, and then
<br>
worry about erradicating tribalism all together.
<br>
