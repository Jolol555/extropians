&quot;Brett Paatsch&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:paatschb@ocean.com.au?Subject=Re:%20[POLITICS/IRAQ]%20Thank%20God%20for%20the%20death%20of%20the%20UN%20%20(Article)">paatschb@ocean.com.au</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>        &gt; Agreements embodied in treaties and in the UN Charter are
</em><br>
<em>        &gt; referred to as international law
</em><br>
<p>What a silly name.
<br>
<p><em>        &gt; But laws, including international laws, that are breached,
</em><br>
<em>        &gt; are still laws.
</em><br>
<p>If unlike the second law of thermodynamics it is possible to violate the law
<br>
and unlike the criminal laws in most nations punishing violators is not even
<br>
attempted then it most certainly does not deserve the lofty word &quot;law&quot;. Stop
<br>
using silly euphemisms and call it by what it is &quot;International Suggestions&quot;
<br>
; and I might add Americans would be absolute fools to trust their lives
<br>
that such a pathetic concept will protect them from another 911 attack, they
<br>
quite sensibly trust a cruse missile more.
<br>
<p><em>      &gt;5 people washed up on a desert island or marooned in space
</em><br>
<em>      &gt;could define a set of laws to live by if they so choose
</em><br>
<p>But without enforcement what's the point of doing so?
<br>
<p><em>        &gt; If any of them exercise bad faith in relation to the agreed
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;obligations  then the law may not be *enforced* but it is still
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;the law
</em><br>
<p>So, you're saying it doesn't look like a duck, it doesn't walk like a duck,
<br>
it doesn't quack like a duck, but it's still a duck. I don't think so.
<br>
<p><em>       &gt;No existing security council  member is claiming that
</em><br>
<em>       &gt;international law does not exist.
</em><br>
<p>That's true and easy to see why; talk of international law makes for
<br>
beautiful chin music, but nobody is dumb enough to bet their life on it
<br>
protecting them.
<br>
<p><em>          &gt; International law can be built in large increments by treaties
</em><br>
<p>You can put any words you like on processed dead trees but international law
<br>
will never be worthy of the name until it has muscle, and that means
<br>
recognition that sometimes war is necessary and that inevitably means some
<br>
innocent people will get killed. I just don't see that happening anytime
<br>
soon in the international community; for example I can't imagine the Green
<br>
Party in Germany agreeing to a war under any circumstances.
<br>
<p><em>          &gt;Under the UN Charter the enforceability of UN resolutions falls
</em><br>
<em>          &gt; to the security council
</em><br>
<p>It must be a typo, I think you wanted to say &quot;fails the security council&quot;.
