Hi Ron h
<br>
&lt;&lt;Let me offer you another homely example.  There is a man named Warren 
<br>
Buffet that out of his own mind earns the kind of money that would really 
<br>
boost our goals assuming of course that we personally possessed that kind of 
<br>
wealth.  In addition we would be improving our society as a main feature of 
<br>
the Buffet method is to encourage worthy corporations (in humanistic terms) 
<br>
by investing in them.  Yet not only don't the people on this list not know 
<br>
how Mr. Buffet does what he does I have querried 3 or 4 of my accounting 
<br>
instructors (after they had discussed how to invest wisely) about Mr. Buffet 
<br>
-- they hadn't a clue.
<br>
Ron h. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ah yes, Warren Buffet, the Prophet of the plains. There is also George Soros 
<br>
of the Soros fund. That being said, let us not ignore two counterpoints:
<br>
1) There is also a Darwinian aspect to who becomes super rich in the Forbes 
<br>
500  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sense of the phrase. They are intelligent people who gamble correctly, 
<br>
get into a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;niche, and milk it for decades; in oil, in real estate, in government 
<br>
services,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;entertainment, marketing, etc.
<br>
<p>2) As Tevya, the milkman, from Fiddler on the Roof sings; &quot;If you're rich, 
<br>
They think
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you really know.&quot;  The purely American equivalent to this is the 
<br>
question: &quot;If 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you're so smart, why ain't you rich?&quot;  Thus, connoting wealth to wisdom 
<br>
in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;covalent amounts.  If this were factual, all physicists and astronomers,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mathematicians, and biologist would be rolling in cash. Alas, this is not 
<br>
the case.
<br>
<p>Is Buffet, a special case of billionaire, a special intellect of human; a 
<br>
throw-forward for the species? I am too un-wise to make such a judgement. As 
<br>
to whether &quot;we&quot; will change, I have no confidence in. As to what we believe 
<br>
in, how we govern ourselves, how we create wealth; I would say that yes, 
<br>
these things must evolve to keep pace with change, to adapt to new 
<br>
discoveries. etc.
<br>
<p>Mitch
