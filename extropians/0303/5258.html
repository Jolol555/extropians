We are a Desert Power! Not those poor schmucks on Dune, the :-)  ok Australia 
<br>
and the UK too!  The show depicted a stone burner detonating, which was done 
<br>
in a rather lovely manner. A slow-motion, cylindrical nuke. I only saw the 
<br>
first part of the series. I liked it slightly better than the 2002 Sci-Fi 
<br>
network Dune series. The new series seems more depressed and more brutal then 
<br>
the first series. But that is what Hebert's point was: don't create gods and 
<br>
make them your rulers, cause it'll screw things up mightily.
<br>
<p>I am currently reading several of Wil McCarthy's works, after completing his 
<br>
science fact book, Hacking Matter. The works are quite good, and moves one 
<br>
along. I miss Herbert's contribution to science fiction writing and science 
<br>
philosophy, probably more so than even Heinlein's works. McCarthy seems to be 
<br>
a hybrid between  D.Broderick + Herbert, writing style and interests. And you 
<br>
thought clonning was a little ways off!
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Apparently this Frank Herbert miniseries was shown last week in the US.
<br>
There's a certain irony, I suppose (desert warfare, the frailty of
<br>
forecasting the future, `the [x] must flow', etc). Leaving that aside,
<br>
what's the reaction of those extropes who've been viewing it?
