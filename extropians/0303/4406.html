<p>&quot;Recently, I have listed as the *top* priority of executives in modern

democracies the object of getting re-elected.  Though true, (and I'm

wondering if I have been too cynical), it's also very likely that the highly

partisan individuals who succeed to high office deeply believe that almost
<br>
the worst  thing that could befall their nation would be to let the

political opposition start running things!&quot;
<br>
<p>Since the topic here is Nixon, and Lee proposes to Judge one's action by

thier motivations, and not on the actions themselves, and then further
<br>
suggests that executirves in modern democracies focus solely on getting
<br>
re-elected, I thought it would be prudent to post this.  For those following
<br>
this thread and following lee's comments, read through this speech of Nixon
<br>
and see if you feel his primary motivation is indeed to get re-elected.

<br>
<p>&quot;I have noted, for example, that a Republican Senator has said that this
<br>
action I have taken means that my party has lost all chance of winning the
<br>
November elections. And others are saying today that this move against enemy
<br>
sanctuaries will make me a one-term President.
<br>
<p>No one is more aware than I am of the political consequences of the action I
<br>
have taken. It is tempting to take the easy political path: to blame this
<br>
war on previous administrations and to bring all of our men home
<br>
immediately, regardless of the consequences, even though that would mean
<br>
defeat for the United States; to desert 18 million South Vietnamese people,
<br>
who have put their trust in us and to expose them to the same slaughter and
<br>
savagery which the leaders of North Vietnam inflicted on hundreds of
<br>
thousands of North Vietnamese who chose freedom when the Communists took
<br>
over North Vietnam in 1954; to get peace at any price now, even though I
<br>
know that a peace of humiliation for the United States would lead to a
<br>
bigger war or surrender later.
<br>
<p>I have rejected all political considerations in making this decision.
<br>
<p>Whether my party gains in November is nothing compared to the lives of
<br>
400,000 brave Americans fighting for our country and for the cause of peace
<br>
and freedom in Vietnam. Whether I may be a one-term President is
<br>
insignificant compared to whether by our failure to act in this crisis the
<br>
United States proves itself to be unworthy to lead the forces of freedom in
<br>
this critical period in world history. I would rather be a one-term
<br>
President and do what I believe is right than to be a two-term President at
<br>
the cost of seeing America become a second-rate power and to see this Nation
<br>
accept the first defeat in its proud 190-year history.&quot;

<br>
<p>President Richard Nixon addresses to the Nation on the Situation in
<br>
Southeast Asia on April 30, 1970
<br>
<p>Good evening my fellow Americans:
<br>
<p>Ten days ago, in my report to the Nation on Vietnam, I announced a decision
<br>
to withdraw an additional 150,000 Americans from Vietnam over the next year.
<br>
I said then that I was making that decision despite our concern over
<br>
increased enemy activity in Laos, in Cambodia, and in South Vietnam.
<br>
<p>At that time, I warned that if I concluded that increased enemy activity in
<br>
any of these areas endangered the lives of Americans remaining in Vietnam, I
<br>
would not hesitate to take strong and effective measures to deal with that
<br>
situation.
<br>
<p>Despite that warning, North Vietnam has increased its military aggression in
<br>
all these areas, and particularly in Cambodia.
<br>
<p>After full consultation with the National Security Council, Ambassador
<br>
Bunker, General Abrams, and my other advisers, I have concluded that the
<br>
actions of the enemy in the last 10 days clearly endanger the lives of
<br>
Americans who are in Vietnam now and would constitute an unacceptable risk
<br>
to those who will be there after withdrawal of another 150,000.
<br>
<p>To protect our men who are in Vietnam and to guarantee the continued success
<br>
of our withdrawal and Vietnamization programs, I have concluded that the
<br>
time has come for action.
<br>
<p>Tonight, I shall describe the actions of the enemy, the actions I have
<br>
ordered to deal with that situation, and the reasons for my decision.
<br>
<p>Cambodia, a small country of 7 million people, has been a neutral nation
<br>
since the Geneva agreement of 1954 agreement, incidentally, which was signed
<br>
by the Government of North Vietnam.
<br>
<p>American policy since then has been to scrupulously respect the neutrality
<br>
of the Cambodian people. We have maintained a skeleton diplomatic mission of
<br>
fewer than 15 in Cambodia's capital, and that only since last August. For
<br>
the previous 4 years, from 1965 to 1969, we did not have any diplomatic
<br>
mission whatever in Cambodia. And for the past 5 years, we have provided no
<br>
military assistance whatever and no economic assistance to Cambodia. North
<br>
Vietnam, however, has not respected that neutrality.
<br>
<p>For the past 5 years as indicated on this map that you see here North
<br>
Vietnam has occupied military sanctuaries all along the Cambodian frontier
<br>
with South Vietnam. Some of these extend up to 20 miles into Cambodia. The
<br>
sanctuaries are in red and, as you note, they are on both sides of the
<br>
border. They are used for hit and run attacks on American and South
<br>
Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam.
<br>
<p>These Communist occupied territories contain major base camps, training
<br>
sites, logistics facilities, weapons and ammunition factories, airstrips,
<br>
and prisoner-of-war compounds.
<br>
<p>For 5 years, neither the United States nor South Vietnam has moved against
<br>
these enemy sanctuaries because we did not wish to violate the territory of
<br>
a neutral nation. Even after the Vietnamese Communists began to expand these
<br>
sanctuaries 4 weeks ago, we counseled patience to our South Vietnamese
<br>
allies and imposed restraints on our own commanders.
<br>
<p>In contrast to our policy, the enemy in the past 2 weeks has stepped up his
<br>
guerrilla actions and he is concentrating his main forces in these
<br>
sanctuaries that you see on this map where they are building up to launch
<br>
massive attacks on our forces and those of South Vietnam.
<br>
<p>North Vietnam in the last 2 weeks has stripped away all pretense of
<br>
respecting the sovereignty or the neutrality of Cambodia. Thousands of their
<br>
soldiers are invading the country from the sanctuaries; they are encircling
<br>
the capital of Phnom Penh. Coming from these sanctuaries, as you see here,
<br>
they have moved into Cambodia and are encircling the capital.
<br>
<p>Cambodia, as a result of this, has sent out a call to the United States, to
<br>
a number of other nations, for assistance. Because if this enemy effort
<br>
succeeds, Cambodia would become a vast enemy staging area and a springboard
<br>
for attacks on South Vietnam along 600 miles of frontier a refuge where
<br>
enemy troops could return from combat without fear of retaliation.
<br>
<p>North Vietnamese men and supplies could then be poured into that country,
<br>
jeopardizing not only the lives of our own men but the people of South
<br>
Vietnam as well.
<br>
<p>Now confronted with this situation, we have three options.
<br>
<p><p>First, we can do nothing. Well, the ultimate result of that course of action
<br>
is clear. Unless we indulge in wishful thinking, the lives of Americans
<br>
remaining in Vietnam after our next withdrawal of 150,000 would be gravely
<br>
threatened. Let us go to the map again. Here is South Vietnam. Here is North
<br>
Vietnam. North Vietnam already occupies this part of Laos. If North Vietnam
<br>
also occupied this whole band in Cambodia, or the entire country, it would
<br>
mean that South Vietnam was completely outflanked and the forces of
<br>
Americans in this area, as well as the South Vietnamese, would be in an
<br>
untenable military position.
<br>
Our second choice is to provide massive military assistance to Cambodia
<br>
itself. Now unfortunately, while we deeply sympathize with the plight of 7
<br>
million Cambodians whose country is being invaded, massive amounts of
<br>
military assistance could not be rapidly and effectively utilized by the
<br>
small Cambodian Army against the immediate threat. With other nations, we
<br>
shall do our best to provide the small arms and other equipment, which the
<br>
Cambodian Army of 40,000 needs and can use for its defense. But the aid we
<br>
will provide will be limited to the purpose of enabling Cambodia to defend
<br>
its neutrality and not for the purpose of making it an active belligerent on
<br>
one side or the other.
<br>
Our third choice is to go to the heart of the trouble. That means cleaning
<br>
out major North Vietnamese and Vietcong occupied territories these
<br>
sanctuaries which serve as bases for attacks on both Cambodia and American
<br>
and South Vietnamese forces in South Vietnam. Some of these, incidentally,
<br>
are as close to Saigon as Baltimore is to Washington. This one, for example,
<br>
is called the Parrot's Beak. It is only 33 miles from Saigon. Now faced with
<br>
these three options, this is the decision I have made.
<br>
<p>In cooperation with the armed forces of South Vietnam, attacks are being
<br>
launched this week to clean out major enemy sanctuaries on the
<br>
Cambodian-Vietnam border.
<br>
<p>A major responsibility for the ground operations is being assumed by South
<br>
Vietnamese forces. For example, the attacks in several areas, including the
<br>
Parrot's Beak that I referred to a moment ago, are exclusively South
<br>
Vietnamese ground operations under South Vietnamese command with the United
<br>
States providing air and logistical support.
<br>
<p>There is one area, however, immediately above Parrot's Beak, where I have
<br>
concluded that a combined American and South Vietnamese operation is
<br>
necessary.
<br>
<p>Tonight, American and South Vietnamese units will attack the headquarters
<br>
for the entire Communist military operation in South Vietnam. This key
<br>
control center has been occupied by the North Vietnamese and Vietcong for 5
<br>
years in blatant violation of Cambodia's neutrality.
<br>
<p>This is not an invasion of Cambodia. The areas in which these attacks will
<br>
be launched are completely occupied and controlled by North Vietnamese
<br>
forces. Our purpose is not to occupy the areas. Once enemy forces are driven
<br>
out of these sanctuaries and once their military supplies are destroyed, we
<br>
will withdraw.
<br>
<p>These actions are in no way directed to the security interests of any
<br>
nation. Any government that chooses to use these actions as a pretext for
<br>
harming relations with the United States will be doing so on its own
<br>
responsibility, and on its own initiative, and we will draw the appropriate
<br>
conclusions.
<br>
<p>Now let me give you the reasons for my decision.
<br>
<p>A majority of the American people, a majority of you listening to me, are
<br>
for the withdrawal of our forces from Vietnam. The action I have taken
<br>
tonight is indispensable for the continuing success of that withdrawal
<br>
program.
<br>
A majority of the American people want to end this war rather than to have
<br>
it drag on interminably. The action I have taken tonight will serve that
<br>
purpose.
<br>
<p>A majority of the American people want to keep the casualties of our brave
<br>
men in Vietnam at an absolute minimum. The action I take tonight is
<br>
essential if we are to accomplish that goal. We take this action not for the
<br>
purpose of expanding the war into Cambodia but for the purpose of ending the
<br>
war in Vietnam and winning the just peace we all desire. We have made we
<br>
will continue to make every possible effort to end this war through
<br>
negotiation at the conference table rather than through more fighting on the
<br>
battlefield.
<br>
<p>Let us look again at the record. We have stopped the bombing of North
<br>
Vietnam. We have cut air operations by over 20 percent. We have announced
<br>
withdrawal of over 250,000 of our men. We have offered to withdraw all of
<br>
our men if they will withdraw theirs. We have offered to negotiate all
<br>
issues with only one condition and that is that the future of South Vietnam
<br>
he determined not by North Vietnam, and not by the United States, but by the
<br>
people of South Vietnam themselves.
<br>
<p>The answer of the enemy, has been intransigence at the conference table,
<br>
belligerence in Hanoi, massive military aggression in Laos and Cambodia, and
<br>
stepped-up attacks in South Vietnam, designed to increase American
<br>
casualties.
<br>
<p>This attitude has become intolerable. We will not react to this threat to
<br>
American lives merely by plaintive diplomatic protests. If we did, the
<br>
credibility of the United States would be destroyed in every area of the
<br>
world where only the power of the United States deters aggression.
<br>
<p>Tonight, I again warn the North Vietnamese that if they continue to escalate
<br>
the fighting when the United States is withdrawing its forces, I shall meet
<br>
my responsibility as Commander in Chief of our Armed Forces to take the
<br>
action I consider necessary to defend the security of our American men.
<br>
<p>The action that I have announced tonight puts the leaders of North Vietnam
<br>
on notice that we will he patient in working for peace; we will be
<br>
conciliatory at the conference table, but we will not be humiliated. We will
<br>
not be defeated. We will not allow American men by the thousands to be
<br>
killed by an enemy from privileged sanctuaries.
<br>
<p>The time came long ago to end this war through peaceful negotiations. We
<br>
stand ready for those negotiations. We have made major efforts, many of,
<br>
which must remain secret. I say tonight: All the offers and approaches made
<br>
previously remain on the conference table whenever Hanoi is ready to
<br>
negotiate seriously.
<br>
<p>But if the enemy response to our most conciliatory offers for peaceful
<br>
negotiation continues to be to increase its attacks and humiliate and defeat
<br>
us, we shall react accordingly. My fellow Americans, we live in an age of
<br>
anarchy, both abroad and at home. We see mindless attacks on all the great
<br>
institutions, which have been created by free civilizations in the last 500
<br>
years. Even here in the United States, great universities are being
<br>
systematically destroyed. Small nations all over the world find themselves
<br>
under attack from within and from without.
<br>
<p>If, when the chips are down, the world's most powerful nation, the United
<br>
States of America, acts like a pitiful, helpless giant, the forces of
<br>
totalitarianism and anarchy will threaten free nations and free institutions
<br>
throughout the world.
<br>
<p>It is not our power but our will and character that is being tested tonight.
<br>
The question all Americans must ask and answer tonight is this: Does the
<br>
richest and strongest nation in the history of the world have the character
<br>
to meet a direct challenge by a group which rejects every effort to win a
<br>
just peace, ignores our warning, tramples on solemn agreements, violates the
<br>
neutrality of an unarmed people, and uses our prisoners as hostages?
<br>
<p>If we fail to meet this challenge, all other nations will be on notice that
<br>
despite its overwhelming power the United States, when a real crisis comes,
<br>
will be found wanting.
<br>
<p>During my campaign for the Presidency, I pledged to bring Americans home
<br>
from Vietnam. They are coming home.
<br>
<p>I promised to end this war. I shall keep that promise.
<br>
<p>I promised to win a just peace. I shall keep that promise.
<br>
<p>We shall avoid a wider war. But we are also determined to put an end to this
<br>
war. In this room, Woodrow Wilson made the great decisions, which led to
<br>
victory in World War I. Franklin Roosevelt made the decisions which led to
<br>
our victory in World War II. Dwight D. Eisenhower made decisions, which
<br>
ended the war in Korea and avoided war in the Middle East. John F. Kennedy,
<br>
in his finest hour, made the great decision, which removed Soviet nuclear
<br>
missiles from Cuba and the Western Hemisphere.
<br>
<p>I have noted that there has been a great deal of discussion with regard to
<br>
this decision that I have made and I should point out that I do not contend
<br>
that it is in the same magnitude as these decisions that I have just
<br>
mentioned. But between those decisions and this decision there is a
<br>
difference that is very fundamental. In those decisions, the American people
<br>
were not assailed by counsels of doubt and defeat from some of the most
<br>
widely known opinion leaders of the Nation.
<br>
<p>I have noted, for example, that a Republican Senator has said that this
<br>
action I have taken means that my party has lost all chance of winning the
<br>
November elections. And others are saying today that this move against enemy
<br>
sanctuaries will make me a one-term President.
<br>
<p>No one is more aware than I am of the political consequences of the action I
<br>
have taken. It is tempting to take the easy political path: to blame this
<br>
war on previous administrations and to bring all of our men home
<br>
immediately, regardless of the consequences, even though that would mean
<br>
defeat for the United States; to desert 18 million South Vietnamese people,
<br>
who have put their trust in us and to expose them to the same slaughter and
<br>
savagery which the leaders of North Vietnam inflicted on hundreds of
<br>
thousands of North Vietnamese who chose freedom when the Communists took
<br>
over North Vietnam in 1954; to get peace at any price now, even though I
<br>
know that a peace of humiliation for the United States would lead to a
<br>
bigger war or surrender later.
<br>
<p>I have rejected all political considerations in making this decision.
<br>
<p>Whether my party gains in November is nothing compared to the lives of
<br>
400,000 brave Americans fighting for our country and for the cause of peace
<br>
and freedom in Vietnam. Whether I may be a one-term President is
<br>
insignificant compared to whether by our failure to act in this crisis the
<br>
United States proves itself to be unworthy to lead the forces of freedom in
<br>
this critical period in world history. I would rather be a one-term
<br>
President and do what I believe is right than to be a two-term President at
<br>
the cost of seeing America become a second-rate power and to see this Nation
<br>
accept the first defeat in its proud 190-year history.
<br>
<p>I realize that in this war there art honest and deep differences in this
<br>
country about whether we should have become involved. That there are
<br>
differences as to how the war should have been conducted. But the decision I
<br>
announce tonight transcends those differences.
<br>
<p>For the lives of American men are involved. The opportunity for 150,000
<br>
Americans to come home in the next 12 months is involved. The future of 18
<br>
million people in South Vietnam and 7 million people in Cambodia is
<br>
involved. The possibility of winning a just peace in Vietnam and in the
<br>
Pacific is at stake.
<br>
<p>It is customary to conclude a speech from the White House by asking support
<br>
for the President of the United States. Tonight, I depart from that
<br>
precedent. What I ask is far more important. I ask for your support for our
<br>
brave men fighting tonight halfway around the world not for territory not
<br>
for glory but so that their younger brothers and their sons and your sons
<br>
can have a chance to grow up in a world of peace and freedom and justice.
<br>
<p>Thank you and good night.
