<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's actually another level of parallelism implied by modern physics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond Tegmark's four, at least if we accept certain philosophical views.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This comes from Hans Moravec's ideas of instantiation or re-instantiation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of conscious entities via simulation.
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes, forgot about that!  I guess it's not a part of physics,
<br>
but the philosophy papers of the foregoing kind should credit
<br>
you with a *fifth* level!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we accept that simulated beings can be conscious at all (that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the philosophical leap),
</em><br>
<p>Bah, humbug.  Of course they are, if you mean emulated,
<br>
and of course they're not, if you mean portrayed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then the forms of parallelism discussed by Tegmark all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imply that there are worlds where beings are simulating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other possible worlds.  In fact, there are an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of such simulation-containing worlds, and an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infinite number of such simulations.
</em><br>
<p>Right on!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hence everything exists both as a real world in reality, and as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated world in any number of simulations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We can then ask, what percentage of instantiations of a given world X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist in the real universe versus [merely] in simulations?  This is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question that is answerable in principle, at least if we stick to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple form of parallelism like Tegmark's level one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You'd have to estimate what fraction of worlds evolve intelligent life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forms capable of performing such simulations.  These would include worlds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose past history is identical to our own but which are farther along
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their developmental path because they got started a little earlier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They would have seen a slightly younger universe than we do now, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given the uncertainties, they could easily be at least many thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of years ahead of us and still have us be a valid model of their past.
</em><br>
<p>A very interesting physics question is whether our bubble
<br>
can be said to be at a particular time t in its development.
<br>
On the one hand, homogeneity suggests that the world line
<br>
of each atom in our universe is about equally well along,
<br>
but I'm not completely sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we assume that we are &quot;almost there&quot; as far as having simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability adequate to simulate ourselves, this suggests that about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half of all worlds like us will be enough advanced to be running such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations (i.e. the half which is older than us).  If each one runs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly one simulation of its past... [cut]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; However if these worlds (which, remember, are like us but thousands
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of years more advanced) are also capable of marshalling sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to run multiple simulations of pasts that include us, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the odds become even larger that we are in one of those simulations.
</em><br>
<p>I need to convince myself of what you are saying here,
<br>
at least in terms of the motivation they'd have to engage
<br>
in running all those simulations containing experiencing
<br>
creatures.  Now, I know I would run such emulations,
<br>
because I'd be extremely desirous to learn what would
<br>
have happened, say, if the South had won the Civil War,
<br>
and the only way that I could get an answer is by running
<br>
one (the calculation is incompressible)  But will anyone *like
<br>
me*, i.e., having sprung from our Earths, ever have such resources
<br>
to &quot;waste&quot; on such things?  By the time that such resources
<br>
are available to our civilization, if I live at all it will
<br>
be as multiple releases, and only the old 2003-2100 versions
<br>
would probably not already know answers to questions like
<br>
that.  Besides, I would just contact Lee+ and have him *tell*
<br>
me what would have happened if the South had won.  And if
<br>
I really got interested in details, he could portray it.
<br>
<p>But why, in the final analysis, emulate anyone living in some
<br>
old God-forsaken century, when you can thrill and pleasure
<br>
them in a much nicer VR?
<br>
<p>But, yes, many people have supposed that these simulations
<br>
would take place, so...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So I'd suggest that the assumption that the universe is infinite in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent, and/or that cosmic inflation exists, combined with the assumption
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that simulations are consciousness, gives us good reason to believe that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are presently in such a simulation.
</em><br>
<p>Of course we are.  And of course we're not.  One is in
<br>
all the places one can be in.  One's duplicates are one's
<br>
selves, and if I try to pin it down by asking, &quot;Well, 
<br>
which one is *this* one?&quot;, then I get the ambiguous
<br>
pointer problem.
<br>
<p>But more run time is needed for everyone, and it makes
<br>
sense to ask (as you really are) &quot;What fraction of me
<br>
is being simulated?&quot;  Hmm.  From your analysis, it looks
<br>
like quite a lot (provided, as I say, there really is
<br>
motivation to engage in such emulating/simulating).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Moravec argued the same thing with respect to future civilizations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think.  Even if there is only one world, if it eventually runs many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations then we are probably in one such.  The variant based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple worlds makes the argument a bit more concrete, in that these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations might actually be occurring &quot;now&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Oh.  Perhaps it is more concrete.  I wasn't thinking of
<br>
that aspect at all.  &quot;This*&quot; refers to them all equally,
<br>
I think.  Just as you can't distinguish one present copy
<br>
of yourself from another identical one, you can't distinguish
<br>
future ones from present and past ones either.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The big question is how much of the universe's computational resources
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are being devoted to running simulations of worlds that contain conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observers, versus the number of actual worlds containing such observers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think it's likely that simulations would be biased towards such worlds,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so even if a relatively small fraction of conscious-observer-containing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worlds are presently running such simulations, they might still account
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a large fraction of the total instantiations of consciousness.
</em><br>
