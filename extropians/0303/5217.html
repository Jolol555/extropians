John Cleese / &quot;Axis of Just as Evil&quot;
<br>
<p>(British Newspaper Article by the &quot;Monty Python&quot; comedian)
<br>
<p>Bitter after being snubbed for membership in the &quot;Axis of Evil&quot;, Libya,
<br>
China, and Syria today announced that they had formed the &quot;Axis of Just as
<br>
Evil&quot;, which they said would be more evil than that stupid Iran-Iraq-North
<br>
Korea axis President Bush warned of in his State of the Union address. Axis
<br>
of Evil members, however, immediately dismissed the new Axis as having, for
<br>
starters, a really dumb name. &quot;Right. They are just as evil, in their
<br>
dreams!&quot; declared North Korean leader Kim Jong-il. &quot;Everybody knows we're
<br>
the best evils...best at being evil...we're the best.&quot;
<br>
<p>Diplomats from Syria denied they were jealous over being excluded, although
<br>
they conceded they did ask if they could join the Axis of Evil.
<br>
<p>&quot;They told us it was full,&quot; said Syrian president Bashar al-Assad.
<br>
<p>&quot;An axis can't have more than three countries&quot;, explained Iraqi President
<br>
Saddam Hussein. &quot;This is not my rule, it's tradition. In World War II you
<br>
had Germany, Italy, and Japan in the evil Axis. So, you can only have three,
<br>
and a secret handshake. Ours is wickedly cool.&quot;
<br>
<p>International reaction to Bush's Axis of Evil declaration was swift, as
<br>
within minutes, France surrendered. Elsewhere, peer-conscious nations rushed
<br>
to gain triumvirate status in what has become a game of geopolitical chairs.
<br>
Cuba, Sudan and Serbia announced that they had formed the &quot;Axis of Somewhat
<br>
Evil&quot;, forcing Somalia to join with Uganda and Myanmar in the &quot;Axis of
<br>
Occasionally Evil&quot;, while Bulgaria, Indonesia and Russia established the
<br>
&quot;Axis of Not So Much Evil Really as Just Generally Disagreeable&quot;. With the
<br>
criteria suddenly expanded and all the desirable clubs filling up, Sierra
<br>
Leone, El Salvador, and Rwanda applied to be called the &quot;Axis of Countries
<br>
That Aren't the Worst But Certainly Won't Be Asked to Host the Olympics&quot;.
<br>
<p>Canada, Mexico and Australia formed the &quot;Axis of Nations That Are Actually
<br>
Quite Nice But Secretly Have Some Nasty Thoughts About America&quot;, while
<br>
Scotland, New Zealand and Spain established the &quot;Axis of Countries That Want
<br>
Sheep to Wear Lipstick&quot;. &quot;That's not a threat, really, just something we
<br>
like to do&quot;, said Scottish Executive First Minister Jack McConnell. While
<br>
wondering if the other nations of the world weren't perhaps making fun of
<br>
him, a cautious Bush granted approval for most axis, although he rejected
<br>
the establishment of the &quot;Axis of Countries Whose Names End in 'guay&quot;,
<br>
accusing one of its members of filing a false application. Officials from
<br>
Paraguay, Uruguay, and Chadguay denied the charges. Israel, meanwhile,
<br>
insisted it didn't want to join any Axis, but privately world leaders said
<br>
that's only because no one asked them.
