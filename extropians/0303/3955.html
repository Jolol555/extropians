<p>While all of this fun discussion is going on, I'd like to say a few words 
<br>
about simplicity.  Sometimes the correct answer is simple, obvious, and 
<br>
straightforward.  So straightforward, in fact, that it is lost amid the 
<br>
noise of people debating all the notions that *almost* work - since only 
<br>
such notions, on the borderline, neither obviously right nor massively 
<br>
wrong, generate the interesting debates that fill up these mailing lists.
<br>
<p>In that situation, it is necessary to - even if it becomes boring - go on 
<br>
repeating, every now and then, that two plus two equals four.  There's 
<br>
really very little you can add to that.
<br>
<p>As far as leveraged altruism goes, nothing is within the same league of 
<br>
the Singularity, for either efficiency or efficacy, by N orders of 
<br>
magnitude.  I really don't see why rational discussion would tend to 
<br>
linger anywhere else.
