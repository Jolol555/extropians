<p>
There's a review of Cory Doctorow's novel in the New York Times at
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/books/review/009ANTRIT.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/09/books/review/009ANTRIT.html</a>.
<br>
<p>As far as &quot;whuffie&quot;, we do have a variant via the web interface to the
<br>
list at <a href="http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67">http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67</a>.  As you read
<br>
the messages you see not only a picture that the poster has chosen to
<br>
associate with himself (a very big one for Lee Crocker!), but also the
<br>
poster's &quot;karma&quot; score.  Anyone can vote positively or negatively for
<br>
another person when reading their posts.  The postive and negative
<br>
values are apparently totalled separately.
<br>
<p>The karma scores seem somewhat counter-intuitive.  It's not surprising
<br>
to see Anders Sandburg at +235/-1 or Elizer Yudkowski at +123/-1.
<br>
Amara Graps seems to be the champion at +273/-4.  And apparently Harvey
<br>
Newstrom hasn't gotten anybody mad at him, at +157/-0.
<br>
<p>But Spike at +4/-213?  That seems a little harsh.  Lee Corbin at +4/-305,
<br>
Lee Crocker at +1/-52, John Clark at +5/-224?  These are some of the
<br>
people I find most informative and stimulating.  Rafal Smigrodzki at
<br>
+1/-296, Robert Bradbury at +17/-187?  I don't really get it.
<br>
<p>My own score is a mediocre +8/-46.  Pretty discouraging.  Lately I
<br>
mostly use the web interface so these numbers are being rubbed in my
<br>
face constantly.
<br>
<p>Hopefully the database is keeping track of who is voting for whom.
<br>
It would be interesting to use the data in more sophisticated ways,
<br>
such as looking for clustering effects.  Maybe all those negative karma
<br>
points were applied by a relatively self-contained group.  It would be
<br>
interesting to see more about how the scores have evolved.
