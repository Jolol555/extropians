</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; Agreements embodied in treaties and in the UN 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; Charter are referred to as international law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What a silly name.
</em><br>
<p>Silly or not. That's what quite a lot of lawyers including US
<br>
lawyers call it.
<br>
<p>It doesn't seem that silly to me. 
<br>
<p>When I see &quot;international law&quot; I see it something like this 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;inter&quot;  - &quot;national&quot;  &quot;law&quot;  
<br>
<p>Which part of this strikes you as the silly bit? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; But laws, including international laws, that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; breached, are still laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If unlike the second law of thermodynamics it is possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to violate the law and unlike the criminal laws in most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations punishing violators is not even attempted then it most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly does not deserve the lofty word &quot;law&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>You do have some interesting notions of law. I'm not surprised
<br>
that it seems silly to you. Still (like me) your are only a youngster 
<br>
of less than 120, so (like me) there is probably stuff you have to
<br>
learn yet. Lots of things can seem silly to us when we are young. 
<br>
<p>You may recall that the first Gulf War, to expell an illegal and
<br>
aggressive invasion of Kuwait was in fact carried out under 
<br>
a UN resolution. Indeed President Bush senior was the 
<br>
US President on that occassion and in my view he did the UN, the
<br>
US and himself much credit in the way he carried out his duties
<br>
- but I digress. That was a time when the US was enforcing 
<br>
international law. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Stop using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; silly euphemisms and call it by what it is &quot;International
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suggestions&quot;; 
</em><br>
<p>I did not coin the term international law.
<br>
<p>If you want to get it banned you'd need to take it up with someone
<br>
more powerful than me. Perhaps someone in the Bush administration.
<br>
<p>You might even get some enthusiasm there for your own term of 
<br>
&quot;international suggestions&quot; ;-)
<br>
<p>Judging by the job that is being done through the media by those
<br>
controlling the information about the war it certainly seems that some 
<br>
in the military and in politics have seen the movie Wag the Dog.
<br>
<p>Perhaps they are on the lookout for a few good euphamism coiners.  
<br>
<p>But careful, remember what happened to character Dustin Hofman
<br>
was playing at the end.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and I might add Americans would be absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fools to trust their lives that such a pathetic concept will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protect them from another 911 attack, they quite sensibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust a cruse missile more.
</em><br>
<p>Ah ha. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       &gt;5 people washed up on a desert island or marooned
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       &gt; in space could define a set of laws to live by if they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       &gt; so choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But without enforcement what's the point of doing so?
</em><br>
<p>There is enforcement. It arises out of the consequences of
<br>
having a bad reputation. Lets say that one of the five was 
<br>
smart and strong and had charisma and leadership abilities 
<br>
and in order to set up the new society as he saw fit he wanted
<br>
to persued the others to work together and do what he wanted.
<br>
Sort of a proto-ecomomic rationalist perhaps. Then say he 
<br>
breached his word to one or more of them over time. He'd 
<br>
still be strong, he'd still be smart, but the offended persons 
<br>
would not forget the injury. And the guy is not always smart
<br>
and he will not always be strong. And sometimes he needs
<br>
to sleep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; If any of them exercise bad faith in relation to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; agreed obligations  then the law may not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         &gt; *enforced* but it is still the law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, you're saying it doesn't look like a duck, it doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; walk like a duck, it doesn't quack like a duck, but it's still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a duck. I don't think so.
</em><br>
<p>No I wasn't talking about ducks. You brought them up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        &gt;No existing security council  member is claiming 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        &gt; that international law does not exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's true and easy to see why; talk of international law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes for beautiful chin music, but nobody is dumb enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to bet their life on it protecting them.
</em><br>
<p>Well the world war 11 leaders Roosevelt and Churchill saw some
<br>
merit in establishing the UN Charter. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           &gt; International law can be built in large increments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           &gt; by treaties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can put any words you like on processed dead trees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but international law will never be worthy of the name until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has muscle, and that means recognition that sometimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war is necessary and that inevitably means some innocent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will get killed. 
</em><br>
<p>It is not just the words that one puts on (paper) that makes 
<br>
international law (or any other law). It is the strenght and courage
<br>
and conviction of those who think that promises should be kept 
<br>
so that there is the possibility, the precious possibility of peace. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I just don't see that happening anytime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon in the international community; for example I can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagine the Green Party in Germany agreeing to a war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under any circumstances.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           &gt;Under the UN Charter the enforceability of UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt;           &gt; resolutions falls to the security council
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It must be a typo, I think you wanted to say &quot;fails the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security council&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>No typo. I meant falls. Perhaps I should have said &quot;rises&quot;.
<br>
<p>Regards,
