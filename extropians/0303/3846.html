<p><em>&gt;Well, perhaps there's nothing wrong with debating both!?  ;-)
</em><br>
<p>But what's to debate? To quote Dr. Phil IIRC: &quot;Who in their right mind
<br>
doesn't understand that eating at McDonald's every day is going to make you
<br>
fat?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Just what part of the principle of &quot;rational thinking&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is not being understood (e.g. saving more people is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; perhaps better than saving fewer people)?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;This resumes a discussion about whether it's people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;lives&quot; or people-years we wish to save. &lt;snip&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Here we are getting to the crux of the matter. The word &quot;lives&quot; is not
<br>
sufficiently defined as to make these kinds of distinctions cut and dry.
<br>
It's an abstraction of the same quality as &quot;peace&quot; which can obviously be
<br>
interpreted a zillion different ways by a zillion different people. I
<br>
suspect the word &quot;lives&quot; may also be buried under layer upon layer of
<br>
unavoidable sapient racism.
<br>
<p>So I suppose I'll now have to (bravely or stupidly) venture out into this
<br>
sociocultural DMZ for a few moments and then bid a hasty retreat.
<br>
<p>When I say I'm concerned with saving &quot;lives&quot;, I am probably concerned with:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Minimizing pain and suffering (primarily sentient, but it's a clunky
<br>
sliding scale which descends all the way down to &quot;that whatsoever possesseth
<br>
a nervous system&quot;)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Maximizing happiness/joy/fulfillment/wonder etc. (ditto the above)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Maximizing the spread of memes more like mine
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Minimizing the spread of memes less like mine
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- And destroying memes (and their hosts) that pose a clear and present
<br>
danger to the continuing survival of memes more like mine as well as memes
<br>
less like mine.
<br>
<p>(That last one is a matter for which I ultimately rely upon my own judgment
<br>
to determine based upon a good faith attempt at objectively examining the
<br>
memes in question along with whatever evidence and judgments of others I see
<br>
as credible, accessible, and pertinent at the time. - Needs work, I know, so
<br>
I'd forgive all of you for not just handing over the keys to the matrix
<br>
server until I get it all worked out sufficiently :-)
