<em>&gt;   &gt;When I see &quot;international law&quot; I see it something like this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;&quot;inter&quot;  - &quot;national&quot;  &quot;law&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;Which part of this strikes you as the silly bit?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The &quot;law&quot; bit.
</em><br>
<p>Ok. I do recall what you've written previously, I think. Would it 
<br>
be fair to characterise your position as being scornful not just of 
<br>
international law them but of law generally? But perhaps with 
<br>
some extra contempt for international law because of its manifest
<br>
failures to date and the problems in enforcing it? No trap intended.
<br>
I'm enjoying the discussion please feel free to re-caracterise or 
<br>
restate your position in your own words (or not). You and I have
<br>
discussed law before and agreed it can be an ass. But I suspect
<br>
a deeper and interesting (to me anyway) difference between us. 
<br>
Perhaps you are one of these anarchist folk whose positions I
<br>
don't really understand yet. Perhaps I have an interest in law 
<br>
which enables me to see some merit in having a workable ass. 
<br>
Sort of something on which civilization can sit.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;You may recall that the first Gulf War, to expell an illegal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; and aggressive invasion of Kuwait was in fact carried out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; under a UN resolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And you may recall that between April and July of 1994 more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than 800,000 people were murdered in the genocide in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rwanda, the UN refused to do anything about it, the USA did
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing either and if they had put a stop to it they would have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been labelled a criminal, at  least according to some. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't recall the details of dates and deaths but I accept that
<br>
you do. I don't think that it was a case of the UN refusing though
<br>
was it? Did anyone try and take the case to the UN do you know?
<br>
<p>The UN Charter Article 2 Para 7 (A2P7) specifically states 
<br>
&quot;Nothing contained [in it] shall authorise the UN to intervene in 
<br>
matters which are essentially of domestic jurisdiction of any
<br>
state or shall require the Members to submit such matters to 
<br>
settlement under [it]...&quot;
<br>
<p>Part of the design compromise to get a UN Charter that was
<br>
signable was to not try and make it all things to all people as
<br>
indeed such would have made it unenforceable, as the big 5, 
<br>
the permanent security council members would not have gone
<br>
for a Charter that dictated to them how they treat their own
<br>
nationals. I don't think this point is well understood about the
<br>
UN. It has quite specific jurisdiction and can't take more.
<br>
<p>And even what jurisdiction it has it only has so far as the 
<br>
security council permanent members don't veto a decision.
<br>
Ultimately all power to enforce comes from the permanent
<br>
security council members military power when they are in
<br>
concert (which has been pretty rarely)..
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; years later ethnic cleansing started in Kosovo and again the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UN refused to do a thing about it but this time the USA 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decided to  become a &quot;criminal&quot; and stop it on their own. 
</em><br>
<p>Same thing. It had to have jurisdiction. With respect I think you
<br>
are doing what many people do with respect to the UN and seeing
<br>
it as a tool of greater utility than it really is (or was). Then your 
<br>
finding it comes up short against the mistakenly high expectation. 
<br>
Maybe I'm wrong on this. Have you ever checked out the Charter?
<br>
As I've said I have only recently taken an interest in it which is ironic
<br>
as I think it is now probably discredited beyond repair, at least 
<br>
whilst the US and the UK hold the position they are holding, which
<br>
is that they have not breached the Charter at all. Even if they were
<br>
to change their position I am not sure that enough of the rest of the
<br>
world would trust these countries and particularly the US whilst they
<br>
remain in the stewardship of the current heads of state. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; More recent mass murders with deaths in the 5 and 6 figure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; range can be found in East Timor, Sierra Leone, Sudan, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Angola and more; the UN and International Suggestions did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely nothing to stop any of them. Many are fond of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saying might doesn't make right but they  forget the UN 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't make right either.
</em><br>
<p>Same comment as above. And true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;There is enforcement. It arises out of the consequences of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;having a bad reputation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will not bet my life that fear of a bad reputation will protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me from a  murderer like Ted Bundy; I want policemen armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with guns. 
</em><br>
<p>I wouldn't expect you too. The UN is not *primarily* about the
<br>
individual rights of persons, any functions in that area were extras
<br>
that came about as dividends of the collective security arrangements.
<br>
It (the UN) is *primarily* about maintaining &quot;inter&quot;-national peace
<br>
and security between sovereign nations. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have even less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confidence that it will protect me from Osama Bin laden or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam Hussein because in certain circles their reputation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would improve not decline by  killing a person like me.
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't you just be another American like other American's
<br>
to them? I mean I doubt they'd have a personal grudge. But I
<br>
repeat the UN was not set up to protect individual US citizens
<br>
from attack. 
<br>
<p>I am not disputing for a moment that the citizens of the US have
<br>
been attacked by terrorists and that the US President is not only
<br>
entitled but obligated to act to protect them. I disagree(d) with
<br>
President Bush's approach because I saw/see it as inferior to
<br>
alternatives not because I disagree(d) with his desire to disarm 
<br>
Saddam or to protect American citizens in the face of a new 
<br>
sort of threat. My criticism of Bush is more that he is a leader 
<br>
that takes on too much collateral damage. Like a bad general
<br>
he is a danger to his own side. He is getting more American's
<br>
than necessary killed. He is of course *also* a danger to the
<br>
other side.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;the world war 11 leaders Roosevelt and Churchill saw some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;merit in establishing the UN Charter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And they spent about a thousand times as much time effort and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money making one hell of a lot of weapons.
</em><br>
<p>This brings up an interesting point. Did you know that one of the
<br>
reasons or benefits of the UN Charter was supposed to be that
<br>
there would be a sort of peace dividend as Member nations would
<br>
not need to spend so much on weapons and military force?
<br>
<p>That was also *intended* to be a part of the essential quid pro quo. 
<br>
<p>That the UN has failed in some senses in the past, and has seriously
<br>
failed in the very recent past with the current crisis doesn't change 
<br>
that it is failing because of the actions of *particular* member states.
<br>
Of course agreements will fail if they are not honoured by those who
<br>
are a party to them. The failure isn't inherent in all international 
<br>
agreements. No one is talking about their country now abandoning
<br>
the Geneva conventions for instance.
<br>
<p>My point is that President Bush more than any other leader had the
<br>
opportunity to put real force into the UN (and it was in the US's
<br>
interests long term for him to do so). Historically, post the cold
<br>
war, with American as the dominant superpower, the US could
<br>
have been a strong agent for making the UN work as it was supposed
<br>
to. It absolutely cannot if the US breaches the Charter. The US is too
<br>
strong. Imo, the only thing that could have kept the US in the UN 
<br>
effectively in the recent crisis was a smarter US President.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;It is not just the words that one puts on (paper) that makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;international law (or any other law). It is the strength and courage
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;and conviction of those who think that promises should be kept
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;so that there is the possibility, the precious possibility of peace.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those who value strength, courage, honesty and peace are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonderful people  but they are not the ones I worry about, they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not the people who want to kill me.
</em><br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Statistically I would think that the chances would be greater at 
<br>
present of you being killed by another American. (This might be
<br>
changing now as a result of President Bush's approach to pursuing
<br>
the war on terrorism). I could be wrong and its beside the point not
<br>
just because the risk of one does not rule out the risk of the other. 
<br>
<p>I think you and I would agree that it would have been untenable for
<br>
President Bush to do nothing post September 11 about weapons of 
<br>
mass destruction remaining in the hands of rouge states. I don't know
<br>
if we'd agree that it was a mistake for him to take the course that he
<br>
did. Because so far I don't think you have stated a position on it. My
<br>
position is that (at least temporarily) President Bush has made the
<br>
US a rouge state. And indeed John Howard has done the same for
<br>
Australia but Australia hardly matters. Imo, the US will recover but
<br>
not quickly and not on President Bush's watch. He has already done
<br>
far too much damage.
