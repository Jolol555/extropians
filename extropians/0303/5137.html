<em>&gt;Additionally, I would be curious to know if you if you organized or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;participated in any protests either here or abroad of the Soviets
</em><br>
<em>&gt;invasion
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes. Soon after my (Latvian) father and his brother made contact
<br>
again after their 44 years separation, in 1988, Gorby took a trip to
<br>
the U.S., with one stop at Stanford University. I was one of the
<br>
many thousand Baltic people protesting the USSR's continued
<br>
occupation, on that day, booing and hissing and carrying banners and
<br>
flags as Gorbachev's limo drove past us along Palm Drive. (hey, we
<br>
made it into the Mercury News :-) ) Since then, my 'protests' have been
<br>
more of an educational role- via some personal Latvian web pages that
<br>
still are accessed regularly all of these years later. Ignorance
<br>
abounds regarding the Baltics- especially on the other side of the
<br>
Atlantic; people confuse that region with the Balkans or somewhere
<br>
else. Since Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania will (probably) be part of
<br>
the EU starting May 2004, I expect there to be an interest to know
<br>
something about that region, so I'll maintain the pages.
<br>
<p>In addition, I have a number of photographs I took in July 1991 when
<br>
I was there of the barricades around the government buildings in
<br>
Riga and Tallinn that are not online yet. This was a time before the
<br>
Baltics gained their independence, but after the Soviet Omon killed
<br>
some who were trying to protect newly freely elected government
<br>
(nonCommunists). This story needs to be told too. I must get those
<br>
pictures up sometime ...
<br>
<p>Presently the page is
