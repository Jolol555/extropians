<em>&gt; This reply is almost certainly a lapse in judgment on my part. All 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ambulatory noncombatants, please relocate behind the yellow-and-black 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concrete revetments.
</em><br>
<p>Well, on the few occasions I've written words like those, &quot;This
<br>
reply is almost certainly a lapse in judgment on my part...&quot;,
<br>
I've instead gone out to the refrigerator for a soda, and then
<br>
watched a little TV.  But I'm glad you went ahead with your post,
<br>
because sometimes emotional overreactions have very occasionally
<br>
to be overreacted against!

<em>&gt; ## Sarcasm Warning 12345: No courtesy evident. ## Semantic mismatch: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Undisclosed,&quot; huh? Never let quality stand in the way of witless wordplay.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, it is getting a little witless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has been evident for some time now that you have very strong feelings, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mr. Mania. And that's fine; many of us do. Permit me to express some of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mine...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This latest passionate post of yours trivializes the matters at hand,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and suggests to me that you are perhaps feeling rather powerless.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, Michael, I think that you've probably penetrated to the
<br>
truth of the matter.
<br>
<p>Also, you raised the concept of *civility*.  When we've lost that,
<br>
we've lost everything here.
<br>
<p>Lee
