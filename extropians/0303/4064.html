I sent this to wta-talk and thought folks on extropians would be
<br>
interested in these numbers as well.
<br>
<p>From: Reason [mailto:<a href="mailto:reason@exratio.com?Subject=RE:%20funding%20and%20advocacy%20for%20anti-aging%20research">reason@exratio.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; Are there any funding comparisons or dollar figures across
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the industry out there that you're aware of? I did some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digging, but turned up a blank.
</em><br>
<p>The real money comes from the NIA and from industry.  It's a little
<br>
tricky to define how much of that is spent on real anti-aging
<br>
research, though.  The NIA's total budget for 2003 is close to $1
<br>
billion.  But a lot of that goes to research on specific aging related
<br>
diseases like Alzheimer's.    I would guess that maybe 10% at most
<br>
goes into research in affecting the fundamental rate of aging.  So
<br>
that's about $100 million / year. I could be drastically off on this
<br>
percentage though - it's just a guess.
<br>
<p>Pharmaceutical and biotech companies can spend up to $1 billion
<br>
developing a single drug.  So does research on drugs for cancer and
<br>
heart disease count?  I wouldn't count it.  I know of a handful of
<br>
companies working on techniques to directly slow the aging process,
<br>
but I don't know of a lot of funding activity other than the recent
<br>
funding of Elixir / Centagenix, which was an $18 million investment.
<br>
Alteon and Geron are both working on interesting technology that at
<br>
least has potential in aging, if somewhat indirectly.  Together
<br>
they'll probably spend $40 million on R&amp;D this year.
<br>
<p>By contrast, the Buck Trust gives the Buck Institute about $5.5
<br>
million. 
<br>
<p>I don't know how much the Elisson Foundation is spending, but they
<br>
made 10 grants to prominent researchers in aging in 2002.  If those
<br>
grants were on the order of $1 million / year / researcher, that would
<br>
be $10 million.  That's probably a high estimate.  I'd guess the real
<br>
number is closer to $5 million.  
<br>
<p>So, as you can see, the NIA and private industry are really where the
<br>
money for research comes from.
