<p>Russell Evermore stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Fact: You haven't read the Age of Spiritual Machines carefully enough, or
<br>
&lt;&lt;have utterly failed to grasp the significance of the &quot;Law of Accelerating
<br>
&lt;&lt;Returns&quot;.
<br>
<p>&lt;Do you really think that Kurzweil's conjecture is wholly accurate? Perhaps
<br>
technological progress is a mixture of fits and &lt;starts, driven by money,
<br>
politics, pure serendipty, and the quality of work performed by any given
<br>
researcher. Perhaps it &lt;take far longer than Kurzweil concludes, despite
<br>
progress?
<br>
<p>I don't think Kurzweil himself presumes his conjecture is &quot;wholly accurate&quot;.
<br>
HowEver, I believe he has made an exceptionally good effort at articulating
<br>
a CONSERVATIVE forecast. The more appropriate questions to be asking right
<br>
are perhaps: What if his conjecture is 60% accurate? 70% accurate? Or, HOLY
<br>
SHIT, 80% accurate?  As far as I can see, even if he's 50% accurate, we'd
<br>
better hold on to our hats.
<br>
<p>What many don't seem to be considering is the completely unprecedented
<br>
consilient effects that IT and the Internet are now having on the entire
<br>
process of technological evolution as a whole. The Internet is just the
<br>
spark before the conflagration. It's like we're all dancing around in a room
<br>
with palm sized chunks of fissionable material. We bang into each other now
<br>
and again and say: &quot;Oh my! That was warm . . . funny that. Still, nothing
<br>
compared to the awesome power that's packed into a single stick of dynamite
<br>
eh!&quot;
<br>
<p>Anyone care to bet on the exact month when the term &quot;nano&quot; firsts appear in
<br>
a Future Shop, or Staples flyer? I've been watching!
<br>
<p>What I'm suggesting here is that the things we might want to pay close
<br>
attention to may have nothing to do with how fast medicine seems to be
<br>
advancing at the present moment, or whether Moore will hold for another two
<br>
decades, or whether we have figured out a cure for AIDS. Criticality is just
<br>
a property of critical mass.
<br>
<p>Why do we anthropomorphically presume that GENERAL HUMAN LEVEL computer
<br>
intelligence is required to trigger a singularity? It seems to me that once
<br>
software attains the advanced pattern recognition ability to read,
<br>
comprehend, and intelligently connect information in novel ways that
<br>
generate subsequent generations of innovative solutions, we will be well on
<br>
our way. That ability might prove to be not all that different from playing
<br>
world class chess.
<br>
<p>Oops, was that yesterday? Oh right. Not quite tomorrow.
<br>
<p>Think about it:
<br>
<p>Unprecedented interconnection of human/machine intelligence.
<br>
Unprecedented interconnection of human/machine intelligence.
<br>
Unprecedented interconnection of human/machine intelligence.
<br>
<p>Your governments are thinking about it.
<br>
<p>Say it over and over until it really sinks in deep. Then you may begin to
<br>
understand what Sting should have meant (but probably didn't) when he wrote:
<br>
&quot;History will teach us nothing.&quot;
