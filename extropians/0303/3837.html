The latest issue of the Journal of Evolution and Technology
<br>
(www.jetpress.org) is hot off the press. Volume 13 contains the article
<br>
&quot;Biotechnology at the Margins of Personhood: An Evolving Paradigm&quot; by Linda
<br>
MacDonald Glenn, Esq.
<br>
<p><p>Abstract
<br>
The last few years have seen scientific advancements that were thought to be
<br>
possible only in the realm of science fiction.  From nuclear transfer to
<br>
exogenous pregnancies, implantable brain chips to transgenic engineering,
<br>
cyborg to chimera, we may be taking the next step in our own evolution. As
<br>
barriers between the species begin to blur and blend, should humans retain
<br>
special elevated status? How will these affect notions of &quot;personhood&quot;?
<br>
Possible implications range from affecting the abortion debate, to
<br>
end-of-life decision making, to animal rights. If traditional notions of
<br>
personhood prevail, are we running the risk of denying essential basic
<br>
liberties to sentient beings?  If modern expanded notions of personhood
<br>
prevail, do we run the risk of somehow being &quot;degraded&quot; and losing our
<br>
&quot;human dignity&quot;?  Legal notions of personhood have lagged far behind the
<br>
philosophical and ethical discourse, yet some courts and legislatures have
<br>
seen fit to extend the definition by creating legal fictions to recognize
<br>
such entities as corporations and ships as &quot;persons.&quot;  The law has been
<br>
notoriously slow in keeping up with ethical issues and technological
<br>
advances; legislatures are loath to deal with controversy and courts must
<br>
often wait until litigation arises out of a crisis.  The next several
<br>
decades will test the flexibility of the law in response to evolving
<br>
advancements.
<br>
<p>In this thesis, I analyze and review the literature of classical ethical,
<br>
religious and legal definitions of personhood.  I explore which significant
<br>
developments in biotechnology may affect evolving legal and ethical notions
<br>
of personhood; I also outline a rubric for considering the definition and
<br>
scope of the human identity as &quot;person&quot; from different research
<br>
perspectives, including legal, philosophical, ethical and technological.
<br>
Finally, I examine whether or not there is a recurrent theme, a common
<br>
thread, commensurability, some unifying underlying principle, in
<br>
philosophical and theological perspectives and in the decisions made by
<br>
courts, legislatures, and governmental agencies.  In my quest for
<br>
commensurability, I argue that a balancing approach is warranted, resulting
<br>
in an expanded, evolving notion of personhood.
<br>
<p>Cheers,
<br>
<p>Mark
