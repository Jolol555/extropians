<em>&gt; &gt; To [politicians], the opposition isn't to be hated; it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; merely the total and conscious Opposition.  They don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think anything like normal people at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure I buy that politicians are a breed distinct from ordinary people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch being personal friends implies an acceptance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Other which I think includes legitimacy of the opposition.
</em><br>
<p>Quite right.  It's as though they're professionals, and
<br>
most of the rest of us are amateur partisans in comparison.
<br>
Oh sure, a few real idealists get into office, but it 
<br>
still seems to me that they are a breed apart.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm trying to unearth psychological differences between normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; left leaning people and normal right leaning people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It feels like you're trying to do so to the disfavor of the left-leaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, whereas I would do so to the opposite.  Perhaps that's just our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biases showing.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, to a large degree, that's probably the case.  It would
<br>
be only natural that the asymmetries I spot would reflect
<br>
well on me.  :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Remember: unlike the far right, which was totally crushed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 1945, the far left was never totally repudiated. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) I think the collapse of the Soviet Union was as repudiating
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the crushing of the far right in 1945.
</em><br>
<p>In the long run, perhaps so.  But we're still too near the
<br>
event, and Soviet atrocities have yet to receive the publicity
<br>
that Nazi ones did.  There have been no War Crimes trials, nor
<br>
will there ever be (and probably for very good reason).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It wasn't total?  Well, neither was the crushing.  Turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left and you see old Communist organizations.  Turn right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you see new fascist organizations -- Le Pen, Haider,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; various neo-Nazis.
</em><br>
<p>Somehow, they seem pretty minor and tame to me.
<br>
But then, if I lived in Europe, perhaps my view
<br>
would be different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anti-Semitism isn't totally dead (even factoring out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-Zionism, mistakenly called anti-Semitism) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rabid nationalism springs eternal.
</em><br>
<p>You see that the Jewish Question muddies the analysis.
<br>
Today, the Jews get their best friends from the Right,
<br>
which is quite different than before.  All these factors
<br>
substantiate, IMO, my thesis that socialism and communism
<br>
have never received the utter demolition that fascism and
<br>
nazism suffered.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think Dan Rather has a useful mental pedigree going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [back] to Lenin, People's Republic of Berkeley notwithstanding.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's not implausible.  Yet there is such a huge overlap
<br>
between leftist and liberal causes that one constantly notices
<br>
things they have in common.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And the right doesn't have this?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not in quite the same way.  I'm excluding the shrill voices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you're liable to pick up on the airwaves these days, from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; right, and I'm excluding the religious types who really do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; believe that God's on their side.  I'm focusing on a large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; !!!!  You're excluding much of what I think of as the right!
</em><br>
<p>Point taken.  But again, the shrillness of many of those voices
<br>
stems directly from the lack of media representation they
<br>
endured all through the 1960s, 70s, and 80s.  And the smug
<br>
liberal reporters and analysts who still to this very day
<br>
control the news at ABC, NBC, and CBS all that time tended
<br>
to treat their stations as the Ministry of Truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; note the asymmetry.  There is no way that &quot;young conservatives&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or whatever could have ever evolved the &quot;Political Correctness&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; viewpoint.  Inconceivable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anti-patriotic?  Un-American?  Communist?  Socialist?  Conservatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might not have evolved the &quot;political correctness&quot; label, but they have the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dogmatic suppression of dissent down pat, in my experience.  Did you mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something else?
</em><br>
<p>No, that's what I meant.  These terms you're quoting are quite a
<br>
mixed bag.  &quot;Anti-patriotic&quot; is scarcely a meme.  &quot;Un-American&quot;
<br>
is two-edged today at best, and has been since 1954.  And there
<br>
are many people who consciously call themselves Communist or 
<br>
Socialist, though for the former not nearly so many as half
<br>
a century ago.
<br>
<p>I'll admit that if the right ever gets a strangle-hold on the
<br>
media to the degree that the liberals got it from the fifties
<br>
through the eighties, they might evince the same behavior.
<br>
But even then, the universities would still be under the control
<br>
of their opposite numbers.  One would practically have to grow
<br>
up conservative, as I did, from 1960 to 1990, to feel the almost
<br>
universal suppression in the media of conservative voices.
<br>
<p>But you've thereby forced me to amend my thesis.  The asymmetry
<br>
I detect in this discussion in terms of behavior and outlook
<br>
between liberal and conservative is most likely due to historical,
<br>
not personality or ideological forces.  If conservatives had had
<br>
a monopoly in the media and on the campuses for thirty years,
<br>
then probably most features would be reversed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yet the self-doubt of liberals is a reality.  It comes from a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number of sources.  The fall of communism is the biggest one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whereas I'd say the self-doubt of liberals comes from the Enlightenment, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific thinking.  You're supposed to doubt yourself, or at least be open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to questions about your ideas.  And you certainly can't be certain of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas because you don't *get* certainty, unless you're doing math.
</em><br>
<p>Well, even the movie &quot;The Manchurian Candidate&quot; made fun of
<br>
&quot;milk-toast liberal&quot;.  Insofar as paying lip service to
<br>
openness and freedom of expression, I can't fault the liberals
<br>
there.  But seeing how repressive towards conservatives they
<br>
often turn out to be, e.g. on university campuses, or inside
<br>
the media (read Goldberg's book), sometimes it's seldom more
<br>
than lip service.  But on this score, I'll hastily concede that
<br>
if a lot of people like O'Reilly or Savage ever got the influence
<br>
that Dan Rather and Walter Cronkite had, it would probably be
<br>
worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Take me, for example.  I used to be pretty libertarian; I've been turning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leftwards economically, based on what I consider the evidence.  Leftward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meaning social safety net, public funding of education and infrastructure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and research, the usual mixed economy stuff.
</em><br>
<p>That's actually shocking.  Do you think that you understand the
<br>
key role of **incentives** in economics?  Do you appreciate the
<br>
absolutely key role historically of private property, and how
<br>
*any* weakening of the protection of private property goes hand
<br>
in hand with increasing poverty and diminution of individual
<br>
rights?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I had doubts as a libertarian, and I have doubts now as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberal, just because economic issues are so complex, and my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economist father taught me not to take economic theory too
</em><br>
<em>&gt; literally or simplistically.
</em><br>
<p>Well, good.  The traditional economists like Samuelson are
<br>
horribly embarrassed (or should be) by the way things have
<br>
turned out.  Economics simply cannot be understood IMO without
<br>
grounding it in private property; yet the role of property
<br>
was practically ignored last century.  If you can possibly
<br>
spare the time, I cannot recommend to you any book more than
<br>
&quot;The Noblest Triumph&quot;, by Tom Bethell.  So much history right
<br>
up to the present time becomes very clear when an analysis of
<br>
the relation between individual rights and private property
<br>
is conducted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More generally, there's this value of tolerance (or &quot;otherness&quot; cf. Brin),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I associate with liberalism, but I could grant to the better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservatives too.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  And I will grant your point here too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It wasn't in the Soviet Union, and it's not in the rabid religious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, and it's at best confused in the politically correct crowd.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But there's this idea that everyone counts, everyone should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; listened to, if briefly, no one should be condemned out of hand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I think is what I meant when I first brought up liberal self-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt.  Liberals as I see them have trouble cohesively keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out the Other, or accepting doing so.
</em><br>
<p>That sounds exactly right to me.  In fact, that's not entirely
<br>
to the good, especially when it comes to &quot;keeping out the Other&quot;
<br>
when the Other is a foreign adversary (e.g. the Soviet Union or
<br>
Saddam Hussein) bent on one's destruction.  You've articulated
<br>
very well this tolerance, which has its bright side, I gladly
<br>
concede, but its dark side as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For the record, I was raised by liberals, went libertarian for a long time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and most of the people I know wander around the liberal-libertarian political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space.  On the left I speak from experience.  People from the right I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience much, except in the media and politics, where they scare me.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the next couple of decades are going to be interesting
<br>
times, ideologically speaking.  Stranger bedfellows than we
<br>
are probably in the making.
