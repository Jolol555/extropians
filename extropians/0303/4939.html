<br>
<p>[Concerning my (Nathaneal's) conjecture:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* Instincts towards violence can’t be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;controlled and have to be kept in check]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am beginning to think that this* common belief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is affecting the way people view the Iraq war.
</em><br>
<p>The entire notion that we even have /instincts/ predisposing
<br>
us towards violence is in stark contrast to the doctrine of
<br>
the Blank Slate, which has been basic dogma throughout the
<br>
20th century.
<br>
<p>Whether or not violent instincts can be controlled depends
<br>
greatly upon the individual and that individual's genetic
<br>
endowment.  Stupidity is also highly correlated with violent
<br>
behavior.  Soon, I predict, people with especially violent
<br>
tendencies can be treated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *That a continuous upgraded net mind will make humans be able to control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their instincts until eventually there is no more violence.*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Such a statement is extremely theoretical.  Although genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes or even IA might give us that ability I am doubtful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that our instincts can be kept in check otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, though there are two levels that you are referring to,
<br>
and I'm a little confused.  There is the level of nations,
<br>
and there is the level of individual people.  I dare not
<br>
speculate on the ways that genes affect the dispositions
<br>
of nations.
<br>
<p>I completely agree that without genetic modification, too many
<br>
people will remain violent, and criminal behavior can only be
<br>
dealt with by the primitive methods now in place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. Many anti-war activists believe that this* is possible and that war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be avoided.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. Many war activists believe that this* is possible and that war is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progressing globalization and thereby causing this to happen sooner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other belief is that this is not possible. If this is not possible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given our technology at this time, than these instincts for power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violence will always be present in society.
</em><br>
<p>Let me address the level of nations for a moment.  Nations
<br>
are *not* in recent centuries administrated by violent or
<br>
sociopathic individuals.  Each such leader, whether it's
<br>
Putin, Blair, Bush, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Marcos or Pinochet,
<br>
is a very sociable and effective team player.  These leaders
<br>
take advantage of the territoriality and instincts of their
<br>
citizens, to serve their citizens by lookout out for the
<br>
national interest (or what they perceive to be the nation
<br>
interest).
<br>
<p>Thus each leader---from Hussein to Blair---acts at some level
<br>
to advance what he believes to be the national interest.  It's
<br>
still true that in non-democratic countries, the egos of the
<br>
leaders have an often appalling effect:  Hitler, or Hussein,
<br>
or in fact any politician whose picture is prominently displayed
<br>
in public as some sort of &quot;Beloved Leader&quot;, often identify their
<br>
own personal interests with those of their nation, and such is
<br>
their control that they get away with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *That these instincts can’t be controlled and have to be kept in check*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the argument is what systems are best at keeping
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these instincts in check?
</em><br>
<p>In my opinion, Anders was definitely on target when he
<br>
suggested that we appreciate the value of the free market
<br>
in moderating non-peaceful tendencies.  Observe that only
<br>
one time to my knowledge (1812-1814) was ever a war fought
<br>
between two democracies.  As much as two neighboring
<br>
democratic countries may hate and despise each other
<br>
(Greek vs. Turk, present day, or American vs. Brit 1928),
<br>
it never quite comes to war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The best systems would be ones that have the smallest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage of people that need to be kept in check,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stopping the problem before it starts.
</em><br>
<p>Reverting to the level of individuals in society, yes!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So then the argument is what is the best propaganda
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to send people so that they have very little ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to revert to these instincts.
</em><br>
<p>I can not think of historical examples in which exhortations,
<br>
maxims, education, or propaganda has had the desired effect.
<br>
Some cultures, e.g. the Amish or Quaker, do succeed sometimes
<br>
in multiplying their numbers through peaceful living, and
<br>
becoming a force against war.  But to the degree that we
<br>
want to credit them, it is their culture, I claim, not their
<br>
having succumbed to someone's propaganda that should get
<br>
the credit.
<br>
<p>(And moreover, it must be kept in mind that such cultures
<br>
to date have thrived only inside protective barriers erected
<br>
by democratic nations---barriers that keep such pacifistic
<br>
communities from being quickly overrun by violent nomads
<br>
or other nations.)
