<p>I'm going to chip in my Eliezer Yudkowsky moddy.

<p>No. I reiterate, Spike: The missing piece is rapid robust distant backup. 
<br>
Such a thing does not exist off the shelf at a good (mass consumer) price 
<br>
yet. I'd love to help bring it to market.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The picture isn't great, but good enough for the purpose
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; range isn't great, but good enough for these purposes as
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I disagree. This is not robust, it is not distant, and it has no backup. 
<br>
It's a baby step in the direction of what I am talking about.
<br>
<p>DISTANT: Need effective range measurable in many hundreds of meters, with 
<br>
signal quality feedback to the operator.
<br>
<p>BACKUP: Need multiple records.
<br>
<p>ROBUST: Need records stored in different hard-to-corral places (say a p2p 
<br>
network), need signal hard-to-jam/detect.
<br>
<p>Typical problem with your proposed approach:
<br>
<p>A few meters away, your friend gets swept up in a dragnet, or detained and 
<br>
frisked, and the only copy goes into the hands of the cops. This happens 
<br>
even with small stuff. *Frisk* &quot;What's this, sir?&quot; If the henchman gets 
<br>
booked, the only record winds up in the property room as a matter of police 
<br>
procedure, possibly edited or deleted or lost.
