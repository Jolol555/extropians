Lee Says
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Okay.  So we turn now to the current event:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Then the irony is, the more effort that is made on behalf of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Iraqi people, then the more imperialistic the U.S. role
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; will become!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; ...to establish a non-authoritarian or less repressive regime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; in Iraq would require an extended stay by the Coalition (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; at least U.S.) forces.  But the longer the stay, the more this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is a case of liberal imperialism.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p>Steve replied
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; This is exactly right. As you say paradoxical. BTW the 'beneficiaries'
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the is policy are likely to resent it, even if they do actually benefit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Lee responds
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, putting aside for the moment the real motivations behind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S./U.K., one then wonders what course would indeed in fact benefit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqis the most (or hurt them the least).  Ramez Naam on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, and perhaps one other person from the Middle East, has weighed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in heavily to suggest that the U.S. stay for a very long time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evidently his intuition is that Iraq could become democratic, were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the occupying power sufficiently idealistic and willing to pay what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever is required to achieve that goal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yet many others demur, including you, from studying the remainder
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your post, where you write
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if the US adopts a minimal approach of removing WMDs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Baathists, replacing them with clients (a Hashemite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; King perhaps?) and then withdrawing most of its military
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; presence, and doesn't try to actually administer or set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; policy for post Saddam Iraq, then Empire has got the thumbs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; down.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So I infer that in this case you're opposed to liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialism because it won't work.  You seem to believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that this particular Arabic country at this particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time cannot be other than it is; basically, a backward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation mixing ancient and modern, which will be ruled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by someone with an iron hand for a long time to come.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is that the only reason you're opposed to the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S./U.K. plans?
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't think Iraq (or any part of the world for that matter) is
<br>
destined in some way to remain pre-modern in some significant respect. I
<br>
also favour actions/policies that will bring about the 'modernisation' of
<br>
Iraq and indeed the entire Middle East. However I do not think, to put it
<br>
mildly, that benign imperialism is the way to do this. I suspect that it
<br>
will prove to be too much of a burden for the US (never mind the cost of the
<br>
war, it's the downstream costs you need to worry about) but even if that is
<br>
not the case I believe the result of such a policy will be to strengthen the
<br>
already growing anti-modern forces in the region (including within Israel
<br>
BTW). In addition to this pragmatic objection I also have a principled
<br>
objection. I do not believe in doing things to people by force for their own
<br>
good even when it is objectively for their benefit.
<br>
<p>Obviously the response is &quot;Well what is your alternative?&quot; My central
<br>
argument is that the alternative is not primarily a different government
<br>
policy. The question &quot;Should America intervene in [insert part of world]?&quot;
<br>
actually means &quot;Should the American government intervene in [place]?&quot; which
<br>
begs all sorts of questions. I would make one teensy weensy change to the
<br>
question. It should read &quot;Should Americans intervene in [place]&quot;. The
<br>
response is then a matter of individual judgement and private action. In the
<br>
case of the ME I believe Americans (and Brits etc) should intervene, by
<br>
assisting groups and individuals, by spreading ideas through organised
<br>
propaganda and indirectly through trade. The key thing in the ME and the
<br>
Islamic world more generally is to fund and help rationalist Muslims who are
<br>
trying to reconstitute the rationalist tradition in Islam (specifically the
<br>
Mutazilite tradition). The terrible disaster that has to be fought in this
<br>
way is the continuing destruction of moderate Islam by Saudi funded salafist
<br>
clerics over the last 20 years. I know you would have to repeal the Logan
<br>
Act but I think you should do that anyway.
