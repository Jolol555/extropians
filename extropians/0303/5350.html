That's a legitimate definition of law, but it's certainly not the only 
<br>
one.  I consider the constitution to be the law, despite the fact that 
<br>
the current administration flouts it with appearant impunity.  And note 
<br>
that under that definition a bank robber who isn't caught or identified 
<br>
could reasonably claim that he hadn't broken the law.  He suffered no 
<br>
ill consequences.  Are you sure that this is the meaning that you want?  
<br>
It seems to be enshining &quot;don't get caught&quot; as the primary basis of 
<br>
what's legal.
<br>
<p>Now, of course, historically in Anglo-Saxon law, the law was whatever 
<br>
the King's friends (Lords of the land) felt like doing.  This caused 
<br>
unrest, so customary limits evolved.  These came to bind the King also, 
<br>
to King John's disgust.  Which resulted in the Magna Charta, formalizing 
<br>
those limits.  Etc.
<br>
<p>So our current laws are a mixed descent of power politics operating in 
<br>
an environment of custom.  And being able to get away with something 
<br>
hasn't been considered to make something lawful... returning to a brute 
<br>
level of power politics (which is what you seem to be asserting) is a 
<br>
good receipe for social unrest.  Laws are supposed to be formulations of 
<br>
custom that limit the demands asserted by the powerful, while 
<br>
acknowledging that they have special priviledges.  This isn't what laws 
<br>
have become, but that's what they are supposed to be.  They are 
<br>
attempting to become the cold iron prison for both the mind and the 
<br>
body... which is what the powerful always want them to become (as it 
<br>
makes their special priviledges even more desireable).
<br>
<p>I consider the way that the word is commonly used to be no more 
<br>
desireable than your proposed definition, though from the other side.  
<br>
But you might want to think carefully on whether that is the society 
<br>
that you want.  There are still choices.
