We'll se how practical these weapons are. Will they be used in the Bagdad 
<br>
battle? But if workable, these weapons seem to be effectively revolutionary 
<br>
in their goal. Why lug or manufacture Artillary, when you can possess a super 
<br>
mortar? It also makes a terror weapon (at least to my imagination) all the 
<br>
more possible.  These weapons, if not hyped, are as big a change in fighting 
<br>
capability, as the introduction of air-ground and air to air missles.
<br>
<p>MMB goes Lorrey!
<br>
&lt;&lt;The Russians, just by the way, are reported to have been fielding a two- 
<br>
shot disposable thermobaric weapon for some time now. They coined the term, 
<br>
and some of the translated documents I've read seem to indicate that the 
<br>
Russians make a distinction between thermobarics and fuel-air munitions 
<br>
like the ones the US has employed in the pre-Afghanistan past. Not sure if 
<br>
that's just NIH at work. (Not Invented Here, not National Institutes of 
<br>
Health).
<br>
<p>From the &quot;baric&quot; part of the name, I am guessing it has to do with the 
<br>
creation of a convection cell to enhance the kill effect, whereas FAMs, I 
<br>
deduce/recollect, are area effect, just go boom and explode or fry the 
<br>
lungs, eardrums, etc. of anyone unfortunate enough to have breathed in the 
<br>
mix.&gt;&gt;
