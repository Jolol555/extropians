I think the widespread ability to tell the truth convincingly would cause
<br>
a singularity by itself, in the sense that there is no way to tell what's
<br>
going to happen afterwards. Virtually all of our current social
<br>
institutions (markets, governments, firms, schools, marriage, friendship,
<br>
to name a few) are designed to solve the problem of cooperation in the
<br>
absence of the ability to tell truth convincingly. All of these
<br>
institutions become obsolete in a &quot;World of Knights&quot;.
<br>
<p>Here's an example of what I mean. Why do we have schools that hire
<br>
teachers as employees instead of self-employed teachers who just rent
<br>
classrooms? Ultimately, it's because students can'be trusted to honestly
<br>
report how much they learned to potential employers. They have to be
<br>
evaulated by their teachers and those evaluations have to be backed up by
<br>
the reputations of the schools. (Notice how much the existence of this
<br>
institution depends on other human cognitive limitations, notably the
<br>
inability to track the reputations of a large number of individual
<br>
teachers.)
<br>
<p>What will replace our institutions is impossible to predict for several
<br>
reasons. One, we don't know how this truth-telling technology will work
<br>
exactly. Can you convince others of your values as well as beliefs? Does
<br>
it prevent you from believing in self-serving rationalizations? Our
<br>
current notions of rationality depends on the assumption that not only are
<br>
your beliefs private, but there is no way you can convince others that you
<br>
truly believe them. If you *are* able to convince others of what your
<br>
beliefs are, it's no longer in your self-interest to only believe in what
<br>
is true. We already see this to some degree because humans are not able to
<br>
lie costlessly. The incentive for self-serving rationalizations becomes
<br>
much higher when lying is impossible. It's not clear whether this could be
<br>
prevented by any kind of technology. Two, there is a lot of inertia behind
<br>
some of the existing institutions, and it's hard to tell which ones will
<br>
actually disappear and in which order. Three, once the problem of not
<br>
being able to convincingly tell the truth go away, what are the remaining
<br>
problems in efficient cooperation and how severe are they? We may be able
<br>
to predict some of these, but the incentive to invent new institutions to
<br>
minimize them (which is a difficult task) doesn't exist yet.
