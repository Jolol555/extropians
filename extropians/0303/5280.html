</em><br>
<p>The key is making the memes thinkable. If you were
<br>
promoting (say) socialism, environmentalism or
<br>
conservatism you would find it far easier, since these are
<br>
memes that belong to the &quot;playing field&quot; of people. They
<br>
might disagree vehemently, but these ideas are part of the
<br>
accepted discourse. Transhumanism isn't part of it, and
<br>
hence will not be easy to spread or get people to take
<br>
seriously. Even if many people know about an idea it will
<br>
not be part of &quot;real&quot; discussions - a lot of people know
<br>
about the Raelians and their views, but they are not taken
<br>
seriously.
<br>
<p>The key is not to try to spread the meme widely, since
<br>
that will mainly fail to convince people in the current
<br>
situation. Instead it is to enlarge the playing field to
<br>
include transhumanism as one view it is possible to have. 
<br>
That requires another strategy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I know a lot of people on this list have probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had successes dealing with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional/intelligensia, but since we definetely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need as least some of the working class, the middlemen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of society (I'm not being insulting, I'm one of them),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to come around I'd like to know if anyone has had much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success intriguing people on transhuman memes.  Or if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone just has suggestions on things to say, ways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach this.
</em><br>
<p>Where do these people get their ideas from? Who determines 
<br>
what is acceptable or serious to think, and what isn't? 
<br>
The answer is that it is the intelligensia that does this, 
<br>
in a kind of cascade effect: the obscure discussions among 
<br>
academics affect highbrow journals and their pundits, who 
<br>
in turn speak with politicians, experts and media. And the 
<br>
media spreads out the memes from this core group. The flow 
<br>
of memes is to a large extent unidirectional; at least the 
<br>
flow &quot;downwards&quot; is far more intense than the &quot;upwards&quot; 
<br>
flow. This means that if you want to reach the &quot;common 
<br>
people&quot; you will have far more effect by making your case 
<br>
to the central core and then let is spread memes than to 
<br>
spend time convincing people you meet.
<br>
<p>Still, everything helps. One good way of making people
<br>
more amenable to think about transhuman things is to show
<br>
them &quot;evidence&quot; from the media - &quot;Look! These nobel prize
<br>
winners are in favor of genetic engineering, and here is
<br>
their explanation why. You can check their arguments for
<br>
yourself. And here is an article about how the handicap
<br>
organizations are wrestling with bionics. And over here is
<br>
a paper about memory enhancement and how much Wall Street
<br>
invests in it. Do you still think I'm a lone crazy?&quot;
