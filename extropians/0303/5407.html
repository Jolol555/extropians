<em>&gt; Actually Michael I did receive a couple of offlist posts questioning
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I should have specified no *public* responses as of yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The most significant of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to completely eliminate the Republican Guard (probably 100K+ individuals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to the casulties in Gulf War I) in order to take out Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the ~100 top level individuals that constitute his &quot;regime&quot;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If that turns out to be necessary then my calculations may be
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That seems a good point, if the justification of this war relied on a dead
<br>
through action vs. dead through inaction comparison based on drawing out
<br>
rates of dead in the past linearly into the future, this would definately
<br>
deserve some deep consideration.  Note my qualifier of drawing out past
<br>
rates linearly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We do not support war because we like to see people die, or get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our jollies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; off of watching bombs fall in Iraq, and until you understand the reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *why* those of us who actually support this effort support it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and address
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those points, your comments will not persuade anyone.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this the key point that Hubert, Max and others need to understand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I refused to return my draft card during the Vietnam war until my father
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (who had served in WWII) made it clear he would throw me out of the house
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I did not do so.  I am *NOT* a &quot;fan&quot; of war.  *But* I am very aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (much more aware than most people on the list) of how the technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for developing/producing WMD are becoming increasingly available to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both rogue nation-states as well as terrorist organizations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I guess it should not surprise me that you received very little response to
<br>
this concern.  You hit the nail on the head.  This is, indeed, the primary
<br>
reason why I support this in addition to the previous ones mentioned.  There
<br>
is nothing that scares me more than realizing that in the future fewer and
<br>
fewer people will be able to committ mass tragedies easier and easier.  We
<br>
need, ASAP, to remove the primary cuases of all this animosity.  Giving
<br>
everybody in the world an avenue to better themselves will remove a LOT of
<br>
the animosity that breeds terrorists, hatred, and intollerence.  Nothing
<br>
would benefit the Arab community more than a wealthy free democracy in IRAQ.
<br>
While in the short term, this will cause more animosity, in the long term,
<br>
it will open up the Arab world to freedom and democracy, which will stem
<br>
animosity.
<br>
<p>This whole scenerio scares me honestly, as there are a lot more 'tribes' who
<br>
animosity could wipe out life on earth.  The greens, for example, may one
<br>
day see it better to wipe off all humans on this planet, we are just raping
<br>
and pillaging it, after all.  And what does a 'reasonable' person do to
<br>
someone who is raping and pillaging?  *shudder* I can not think of a way to
<br>
work to diminish the animosity of some of these groups, which is why I am
<br>
involved in and support the lifeboat foundation (www.lifeboat.com)
<br>
<p>For starters though, lets try to bring the arab nations out of the corrupt,
<br>
oppressed middle ages their murderous dictators and theocracies keep them
<br>
in.  Right now one must be a motivated billionaire or have connections to
<br>
one to really wreak mass havoc and thousands of deaths.  In 10 years, one
<br>
may need only be a millionaire, 10 years after that, a moderately
<br>
intelligent well motivated individual could wipe out thousands to millions
<br>
of people.  I see it in my head as a graph, the resources (intellect, money,
<br>
time) etc needed to commit massive tragedies continues to decline, while an
<br>
opposing line, how many people one can kill, rises.  Linearly?
<br>
Exponentially?  Logorithmically?  Scary stuff.  This was the reason why I
<br>
added my optimistic outcome in my list
<br>
<p>6) There are no Arab Democracies, and a democratic IRAQ could potentially
<br>
become a 'shinning beacon of democracy in an arab sea of tyranny, oppresion,
<br>
and despair'  When arab peoples see the life that can be lived in a free
<br>
Arab nation, it can help to diffuse the anti-west hatred and anti-progress
<br>
attitude that many arab theocracies,  monarchies, and dictators have imposed
<br>
upon their people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People who promote &quot;peace at all costs&quot; simply do not recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that these technologies have the capacity for eliminating civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as we know it (note my recent posts on SARS -- and that is probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a natural situation).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll make an assertion to people who object to my position (or the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities of the U.S./U.K./Au) -- *you* are *clueless* with respect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to how bad it could get and how close people who have virtually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no respect for &quot;human dignity&quot; are to bridging the gap to the point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where they are executing your worst nightmare.  How long do you need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to watch Al-Jazeera before you figure out that they are promoting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;unextropic&quot; concept that they want you (&quot;us&quot;) dead?
</em><br>
<p>Well said.
<br>
<p>And this leads of course back to the question of assessing the causalties of
<br>
inaction vs. action, and why a linear projection of current rates isnt
<br>
valid.  In the future, a pissed of terrorist could wipe out *the entire
<br>
human population*  Yeah, some Iraqi civilians will be killed in this attempt
<br>
to overthrow a murderous dictatorial regime, but if we dont provide a
<br>
democratic peacefull aveneue for arabs and middle easterners to grow, they
<br>
may very well wipe humanity off the face of the earth.  The most clinching
<br>
moment for this was probably reading Robert Wrights &quot;A Real War On
<br>
Terrorism&quot; (<a href="http://slate.msn.com/?id=2070210&amp;entry=2070211">http://slate.msn.com/?id=2070210&amp;entry=2070211</a>ich some list
<br>
members have cited to support an stance against this war.  I found it the
<br>
opposite, especially Wrights description of what Mohommad Atta went through
<br>
in various Arab countries trying to find a positive productive outlet for
<br>
his efforts and intellect, and was blocked every step of the way, eventually
<br>
finding the only avenue offered, terrorism.  In fact, Wright recommends
<br>
democraticization in authoratarian Arab regimes to stem this tide of growing
<br>
animosity, along with globalization.  Basically acknowledging that these
<br>
efforts will lead to resentment among arabs, Wright still recommends to
<br>
'Take your bitter medicine early' saying &quot;But in the case of terrorism, I
<br>
have a decided preference because in 10 or 20 years, terrorism will have
<br>
much more lethal potential than it has now. So, if there are burdens we can
<br>
bear now-in money, even in lives-that will dampen future terrorism, they're
<br>
probably worth it.&quot;  While some or much of this essay to some will lead them
<br>
to not support the current war, I found it a more compelling argument to
<br>
support it, although critical of particulars of some of Bush's actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And thank you Michael for detailing points that need to responded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to (i.e. the rationale behind a pro-war position) much better than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I might have done.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Thank you for the positive comments Robert.  I am not surprised that no one
<br>
has yet respoded to these points with anything except &quot;I dont like this war&quot;
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
