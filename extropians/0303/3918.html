<p>Like the old joke goes: Phew!  I thought you said 22 MILLION years!
<br>
Not very funny for Extropians though.
<br>
<p>Basically this paper examines what would happen if the &quot;dark energy&quot;
<br>
had slightly more negative pressure than currently imagined, and it shows
<br>
that eventually the negative pressure becomes overwhelming, tearing apart
<br>
every form of structure.  Furthermore, amazingly enough, rather plausible
<br>
values of the pressure parameter imply that we will switch to that &quot;rip&quot;
<br>
epoch relatively soon.  The universe is presently about 13 GYr (billion
<br>
years) old, and the &quot;Big Rip&quot; is estimated at 35 GYr.
<br>
<p>The universe's history can be divided into epochs where various physical
<br>
effects dominate.  We are presently in what you might call the &quot;galactic
<br>
epoch&quot;, where gravitationally bound structures like galaxies and stellar
<br>
systems are the main structures.  The authors argue that this epoch is
<br>
unique in the whole history of the universe (supposing the Big Rip theory
<br>
is true) in that it is the only one where nonlinear, complex structures
<br>
can form.  Earlier and later in history, everything is very uniform.
<br>
The implication might be that only now could life form.
<br>
<p>So we have a universe where life evolves and then more or less immediately
<br>
(on the cosmic scale) gets destroyed.  And that's actually what has
<br>
always been expected, by anthropic considerations.  It has been a bit
<br>
of a mystery why the universe has seemed to be so much bigger and more
<br>
elaborate than is necessary for life to evolve.  &quot;Anthropicists&quot; would
<br>
predict that the universe is as complex as necessary for life, but no
<br>
more so.  Well, this theory seems to be one of the first ones where the
<br>
universe meets that description, at least in terms of its temporal extent.
<br>
<p>It's possible that this &quot;ripping&quot; force could be a source of energy as we
<br>
approach the final days, giving us the ability to do more computations
<br>
than would otherwise be possible.  However I don't think we can get an
<br>
infinite number of computations as in Frank Tipler's Omega Point theory
<br>
which relied on a Big Crunch.  The problem is that we are constantly
<br>
losing matter as it is ripped away by this infinitely powerful force.
<br>
So even though we may gain energy, we lose matter and so will be able to
<br>
do less and less with what we have.  Eventually all structure is lost.
<br>
All in all this is not a hopeful model.
<br>
