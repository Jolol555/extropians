<p><em>&gt; I suggest that anyone who thinks war is a good idea take it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; upon themselves to keep reading this, until the day it finally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cuts off.  Just to remember that there are real people in there.
</em><br>
<p>Probably the people who believe that the war is a bad idea
<br>
could read it with profit also.  The essential thing to
<br>
remember is that not only are there real people in Baghdad,
<br>
there are real people wherever there are people.
<br>
<p>It's impossible for anyone to come to grips with all the
<br>
independent &quot;realities&quot; of individuals in even a small village.
<br>
So our mental representations invariably abstract, and we
<br>
resort to thinking of &quot;those Germans&quot;, or &quot;those Americans&quot;.
<br>
<p>Long ago I read some criticism of an author's work, where
<br>
the critic accused him of taking the stance &quot;to know me is
<br>
to love me&quot;.  But that phrase continues to haunt.  Is it 
<br>
true?  Is it actually the case that were one of us somehow
<br>
intimately knowledgeable about the details of the life of a
<br>
random other person, one would come to love him or her?
<br>
<p>I think that it *is* true.  Perhaps (in almost every case)
<br>
what would happen is that you would learn to see everything
<br>
from this person's perspective, and you'd come to understand
<br>
and accept this person's own limitations (at least insofar as
<br>
they were limitations according to you).  Thus enormous
<br>
natural sympathy would well-up within you for this person.
<br>
<p>But surely this cannot be true of everyone, can it?  I mean,
<br>
if you became intimately familiar everything ever done by
<br>
Ted Bundy, Charles Ng, Adolph Hitler, or Saddam Hussein,
<br>
surely you would still detest and abhor this individual, no?
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliezer, I don't think you can find anyone, &quot;who thinks war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a good idea.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Well, what Eliezer undoubtedly meant to refer to were those
<br>
people who believe that invading Iraq is a good idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bill Maudlin, I think, said he saw two [people] like that in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2nd WW.  But then he  saw a lot more soldiers than I ever have.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, some creeps used to believe that war is a noble activity.
<br>
They're very similar in attitude to those who believe that
<br>
suffering in general is ennobling, or that our lives would
<br>
be much less rich without suffering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; At best [most] you will find people who believe a war is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary.
</em><br>
<p>That's practically everyone; there have no pacifists, it appears,
<br>
even on this rather abstract and ideological forum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But  that is almost always in a specific situation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only because they think the cost of not fighting is higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than the likely cost of fighting.
</em><br>
<p>Yes---so believe those of us favoring this particular invasion.
<br>
It's definitely not that we see the thousands of lives being
<br>
lost as &quot;for oil&quot;, but rather for saving even more in the future.
<br>
<p>Still, I admit, it's rather gruesome to be investing in lives.
<br>
Yet, unless one accepts the pacifist stance, isn't that exactly
<br>
what one always does?
<br>
<p>Lee
