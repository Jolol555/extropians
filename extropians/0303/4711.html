\&quot;The \&quot;leftists\&quot; on this list are largely intelligent and Extropian         
<br>
individuals                                                                   
<br>
with whom I disagree on a number of issues sometimes for subtle and           
<br>
complicated reasons that have more to do with information theory than         
<br>
whether                                                                       
<br>
or not they \&quot;love America\&quot; or \&quot;love Freedom\&quot;.                             
<br>
<p>The pseudo-libertarians who fill this list with liberal-baiting, childish,    
<br>
ad-hominem insults are interfering with the spread and evolution of           
<br>
libertarian memes. They are like Revolutionary Workers League moles           
<br>
infiltrating real activist groups or Scientologist moles infiltrating damn    
<br>
near anything they can.\&quot;                                                     
<br>
<p>Ah, so every one that you mostly agree with is intelligent and extropian,
<br>
<p>Remarkable! You quote me, and then you claim I said something that is
<br>
absolutely not supported by the very quote you made.

but everyone who mostly disagrees with you is childish and will resort to     
<br>
nothing but ad-hominem insults.  But wait, is calling someone childish an     
<br>
ad-hominem?  Or can it *gasp* be possible that many people on this list,      
<br>
<p><p>It's not ad-hominem if it's true. Besides, I haven't called *you* childish, as
<br>
yet.

from differing backgrounds, are intelligent, and can legitimately come to     
<br>
differing opinions on subjects? (back to the whole can we work out            
<br>
<p><p>I agree.

disagreements thread) I would also add that 'libertarian memes' (which ones?  
<br>
all of them?) have yet to be proven objectively to be the best memes on       
<br>
every subject, and as such 'interfering with their spread' may or may not be  
<br>
a good thing.  For the record, I am a registered libertarian.                 
<br>
<p><p>I agree, there are bugs in Libertarianism that need to be identified,
<br>
understood, and repaired. That's a worthwhile thread to pursue. Unlike these
<br>
war threads, since it's a done deal and no force on Earth will change Bush's
<br>
mind.
