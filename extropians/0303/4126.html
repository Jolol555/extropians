<em>&gt; (<a href="mailto:cryofan@mylinuxisp.com?Subject=Re:%20Do%20patents%20really%20foster%20innovation?">cryofan@mylinuxisp.com</a> &lt;<a href="mailto:cryofan@mylinuxisp.com?Subject=Re:%20Do%20patents%20really%20foster%20innovation?">cryofan@mylinuxisp.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I write patents for a living. So obviously I have a bias...
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure there are honest farmers who oppose farm subsidies,
<br>
just as there are authors and musicians and artists and
<br>
programmers who oppose copyright and inventors who oppose
<br>
patents.  Don't assume that because a present political
<br>
system favors some group that there aren't members of that
<br>
group with the vision and integrity to look beyond their own
<br>
short-term interests.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But mainly our clients seek protection for the products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are developing.  Why should they spend millions to develop,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example, a circuit simulation system, and then sell it, only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have a competitor copy the design for a fraction of the cost?
</em><br>
<p>Just as I said, that's the only good argument in favor of patents:
<br>
to encourage long-term speculative R&amp;D.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Obviously, the world is a better place for having a superduper
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new circuit simulation engine available to make all our trinkets,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maybe even help design life saving devices....
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but it's not as obvious as you think.  What if instead of
<br>
locking themselves in a room for ten years and building the
<br>
simulator from scratch they had instead spent a few weeks adapting
<br>
an existing well-known open source simulation system to their
<br>
application and posted their patches on the net?  Then they or
<br>
someone else spends a week or two fixing bugs or improving its
<br>
performance, then they or someone else adds a new feature or two,...
<br>
and that process continues a week at a time for that same ten years.
<br>
Wouldn't a more reliable system be available sooner for more people
<br>
to use to create those lifesaving widgets (or whatever other uses
<br>
other people might have some up with for other adaptations of
<br>
the system)?
