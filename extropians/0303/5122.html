<p>Hi Natasha.  Do you happen to know whether that site is
<br>
balanced or not?  Have you listened to it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm glad that Damien posted a news story that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reported Iraqi casualties.  I do not want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that only American lives are important.
</em><br>
<p>Shudder.  Yes.  Absolutely all the truths must
<br>
and should come out.  Our tempest in a teapot
<br>
was a rather arcane matter of subtle etiquette
<br>
IMO.  A completely separate post by him or anyone
<br>
else wouldn't have caused the slightest objection
<br>
from me, that's for sure!
<br>
<p>But it does bring up the question of the mindset of
<br>
those---no one I know of, especially on Extropians
<br>
---who would think human lives unimportant so long
<br>
as they were &quot;the enemy&quot;, or belonged to a &quot;subhuman&quot;
<br>
or despised ethnic group.
<br>
<p>I suppose that it had evolutionary advantages at some
<br>
point in the past to see others as not &quot;the people&quot;.
<br>
Hopefully, we are beyond that in most ways.
<br>
<p>The second point about this is why are the American
<br>
soldier casualties and the Iraqi civilian and soldier
<br>
casualties of more concern than, say, the approximately
<br>
one-hundred fatalities on America's highways each day?
<br>
I think that there *is* a good explanation for this,
<br>
but it takes work, and I'll answer another time.
<br>
<p>For that matter, a third point is &quot;why are the lives
<br>
of non-combatants often assumed to be more valuable
<br>
than the lives of young soldiers?&quot;.  I'm afraid that
<br>
anyone who thinks that the death of a soldier is okay,
<br>
but that the death of a civilian is somehow worse is
<br>
laboring under the delusion that war is some sort of
<br>
game, and certain people have signed up to play.
<br>
<p>This is to be distinguished, of course, from the 
<br>
entirely separate question of the morality, especially
<br>
in war time, of the deliberate killing of soldiers
<br>
as opposed to the deliberate killing of civilians.
<br>
