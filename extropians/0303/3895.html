<p>Perhaps a better analogy is this: trying to decide whether re-runs are
<br>
good is like trying to decide whether solipsism is correct. Today
<br>
solipsism can be refuted, by Occam's Razor (or Kolmogorov's Razor to
<br>
borrow Eliezer's term), but realizing this required the invention of
<br>
algorithmic information theory (which includes a definition of simplicity
<br>
that is mathematically rigorous and more or less self-evident). Before
<br>
that, different people had different intutions about what was simplier:  
<br>
that only I exist, or that the whole universe exists? And there was no way
<br>
to convince someone whose intuition differed from you.
<br>
<p>We need the equivalent of algorithmic information theory for moral 
<br>
philosophy. Until we have one, I doubt that the debate of whether re-runs 
<br>
are valuable can ever get beyond the dueling-intuitions stage. I think 
<br>
being agnostic at this point is not defeatist, just realistic. It means we 
<br>
need to consider all possibilities when planning for the future.
