</em><br>
<p>While Eliezer's position is I believe partially correct -- in that the
<br>
sooner we get the Singularity the better -- at least from some positions
<br>
in that I think he assumes you get a friendly AI, while I'm concerned
<br>
that before then we might get a rogue AI (I think we had a discussion
<br>
about this months ago because the Kazaa network most likely has the
<br>
CPU resources).  So there is a risk that humanity will never get to
<br>
the singularity.  In which case by focus only on the Singularity we
<br>
may have lost many years of lives people otherwise might have lead
<br>
if we only focus on getting to the Singularity.  For example, The
<br>
Hunger Project leads dozens if not hundreds of people around the
<br>
world to solve fundamental educational and societal problems that
<br>
are responsible for killing millions of people (over a number of years).
<br>
I believe that we need to solve problems of that nature (those that
<br>
lead to premature death) The people who die this year, next year or in
<br>
the other intermediate future will never make it to the Singularity.
<br>
On the other hand if we invest properly in ending war, hunger, extending
<br>
longevity, etc. then we will save more lives than if we focused *just*
<br>
on making the Singularity arrive sooner.  It comes down to the relative
<br>
number of lives you use by allocating your resources for the different
<br>
purposes.
