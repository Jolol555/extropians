<p>There is a tremendous difference in economic effort.  The US spends approx.
<br>
$300 billion each year on defense.  Iraq has probably been lucky to spend
<br>
$2B a year since 1991 and was only spending $10B a year before that.
<br>
<p>Proportionately, if the US were purchasing the same type of weapons as
<br>
the Iraqis at the same prices, our invasion army would have 30 million men.
<br>
There would be more Americans in Iraq than Iraqis.
<br>
<p>After Gulf 1 I did some calculations on how much the US was spending to 
<br>
destroy Iraqi equipment.  Our effort cost $65 billion.  I gathered figures 
<br>
on what had been destroyed and what the value of that equipment was on the 
<br>
world market.  It turned out that we were spending about $13 to destroy $1 
<br>
of enemy stuff.
<br>
<p>So far, I haven't seen anything that wasn't also present in Gulf 1.  
<br>
Precision weapons, Iraqis surrendering en masse, operation proceeding &quot;much
<br>
better than we had dared to hope&quot;, it is almost an exact replay.
