Samantha Atkins writes, regarding the question of whether the economics
<br>
literature on public goods is relevant to intellectual property issues:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, not without making the distinction.  Go read the works of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lessing if interest in what the distinctions are and why they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are crucially important.
</em><br>
<p>Hmmm, Lessing?  Apparently you are referring to the 18th century German
<br>
playwrite Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, who did write about intellectual
<br>
property and ownership thereof.  That's a surprisingly erudite reference
<br>
coming from you.
<br>
<p>Lessing struggled to make ends meet as a playwrite and was a strong
<br>
advocate for the right to sell ones works, a challenging concept in its
<br>
day.  He wrote, in his essay Live and Let Live:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What?  The writer is to be blamed for trying to make the offspring of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his imagination as profitable as he can?  Just because he works with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his noblest faculties he isn?t supposed to enjoy the satisfaction
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the roughest handyman is able to procure - that of owing his
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;livelihood to his own industry?  But wisdom, they say, for sale for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cash!  Shameful!  Freely hast thou received, freely thou must give!
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus thought the noble Luther in translating the Bible.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luther, I answer, is an exception in many things.  Furthermore, it is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for the most part not true that the writer received for nothing what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;he does not want to give away for nothing.  Often an entire fortune
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;may have been spent preparing to teach and please the world.

<p>Actually I'm pulling your leg.  I'm sure you simply misspelled the name of
<br>
Stanford law professor Lawrence Lessig, who recently argued on copyright
<br>
issues before the Supreme Court.  I am pretty familiar with him, I read
<br>
his essays and columns regularly, although I haven't read his books.
<br>
<p>Perhaps you could amplify which specific points made by Lessig are
<br>
relevant to the question of whether intellectual property could or should
<br>
be treated economically like a public good.
