<p>Amara, while I'm in general agreement with your sentiments here, the last 
<br>
sentence is a pure non sequitur.  The pragmatic truth is that plenty of 
<br>
people who can't stand their current bodies would be quite happy with a 
<br>
Primo 3M.  Yes, genuinely happy.
<br>
<p>As a reductio ad absurdum, consider any transgender.  Would the woman/man 
<br>
inexplicably condemned by fate to live as a man/woman still suffer from 
<br>
those hangups with a genuine female/male body?  No, they'd live happily 
<br>
ever after.  So it goes.
<br>
<p>There's something to be said for Zen, but there's also something to be 
<br>
said for people learning to be serene *after* the pain goes away.  Death 
<br>
is a problem, so people fear it; now they have two problems.  *Two* 
<br>
problems.  Not *one*.  Death doesn't stop being a problem because fear of 
<br>
death is also a problem; the two are independent.  Which is more urgent? 
<br>
Death, of course.  As for the second problem, will people get over their 
<br>
fear of death a lot faster once death is no longer a problem?  Yes, of 
<br>
course they will.  And no, this isn't &quot;cheating&quot;.
<br>
<p>The moral is that people will learn to accept beautiful bodies as easily 
<br>
as ugly ones.  Today they have *two* problems, and one of them makes it a 
<br>
lot harder to get started on the other one.
