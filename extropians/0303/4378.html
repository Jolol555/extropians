<p>&quot;I would not characterise Nixon as a loon.  Certainly Caligula was much

more insane.  He did, however, betray his oath of office repeatedly.  He 
<br>
did suborn justice.  He did attempt to destroy the evidence.  I believe 
<br>
that he did many more cimes, but those are matters of public record.  So 
<br>
he may not have been a literal loon.  Perhaps.  And he may have done 
<br>
some good things.  (OK.  It's quite likely that he wasn't intending to 
<br>
destroy the government, and he probably saw himself as the good guy, and 
<br>
did what he thought a good guy would do.)&quot;
<br>
<p>He &quot;might&quot; not have been a literal loon? Mr. Hixson, you're too kind...:) I 
<br>
think it fair to say, and quite obviously,  that he believed when making 
<br>
decisions, as I think is the case with most of our chief executives, he was 
<br>
acting in the best interest of the people of the United States. But more to 
<br>
the point, your characterization remains grossly unfair. &quot;Certainly Caligula 
<br>
was much more insane?&quot; Come on. I don't know what you're basing your 
<br>
psychoanalysis on, whether it be Anthony Summers, who when not writing about 
<br>
President Nixon's &quot;abuses&quot; has written about how Anastasia survived the 
<br>
Soviet coup, or Woodward and Bernstein's &quot;Final Days&quot; in which it has been 
<br>
illustrated that they didn't even talk to some of their quoted sources (such 
<br>
as Edward Cox), but let's get to the record here. You phrase your argument in 
<br>
such a way that you seem to suggest that it is more likely that President 
<br>
Nixon was at least partially insane than it is likely that he accomplished 
<br>
anything of merit. &quot;He may have done some good things&quot;, was your wording.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I think before fully elaborating on this topic it would be helpful to know 
<br>
precisely where you stand on this issue. Do you suggest that somehow Nixon's 
<br>
actions, whatever they may be, were somehow of such a unique nature that only 
<br>
he deserved in the history of our republic to be removed from office and 
<br>
perpetually villified? Do you even suggest that Nixon was somehow the only 
<br>
one of his Presidential contemporaries to engage in any or all of the 
<br>
activities you claim he was guilty of? Do you suggest that Nixon's role on 
<br>
the periphery of a bungled break-in of a party headed toward a defeat of 
<br>
historical proportions in that November's presidential elections were more 
<br>
serious a threat to &quot;The Constitution, our system of government, way of life&quot; 
<br>
or any other apocalyptic term you choose to use than say, Lincoln's 
<br>
abolishment of the writ of Habeus Corpus or FDR interning thousands of 
<br>
Japanese-Americans in concentration camps?
<br>
<p>&quot;But he clearly deserved to be not only impeached, but convicted and 
<br>
sentenced to hard labor.  At minimum.  My personal feeling was that he 
<br>
should have been &quot;crucified in a public square&quot; for betrayal of his 
<br>
country.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, given your attitudes on President Nixon, as an example, I would ask 
<br>
you to explain to me where precisely after two years of perpetual committee 
<br>
leaks, unsubstantiated charges of all sorts, and flat out hostile press 
<br>
coverage, where precisely do you think he would have received a fair trial in 
<br>
this country?
<br>
<p>&quot;But he wasn't as bad as Bush, not even nearly.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would ask that you elaborate further on this comment before I respond.   
<br>
<p>&quot;We just had 
<br>
higher standards then.&quot;
<br>
<p>This, at best, is wishful thinking. At worst it is nothing short of fantasy. 
<br>
If &quot;we&quot; had such high standards, then why weren't the &quot;paragons of justice&quot; 
<br>
in the 93rd Congress and their predecessors interested in bringing Nixon's 
<br>
predecessors to &quot;justice&quot; for at the very least the same charges which were 
<br>
brought against Nixon?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
