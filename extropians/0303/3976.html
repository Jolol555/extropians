<p><em>&gt;Forwarding the private reply of Tom Van Flandern - twc:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*****
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Terry,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Thanks for your e-note. The &quot;logic&quot; of Ron Ebert [&quot;re&quot; below] is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;amusing. Most of these complaints arose because he did not read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;original article with citations, but only the capsulized summary of four
</em><br>
<em>&gt;points that struck someone's fancy in &quot;Science Frontiers&quot;. Apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ebert's rebuttal, which makes unsubstantiated claims about four points
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from a list of 30, is supposed to imply that the whole list is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;defective. That itself is invalid reasoning. And none of these four
</em><br>
<em>&gt;points were among the top 10 in the list. Here are my specific comments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on the Ebert message:
</em><br>
<p>I replied to what was forwarded by Terry to the Skeptic list. Science 
<br>
Frontiers is not recognized as an academic journal or general interest 
<br>
journal and our university library doesn't carry it. I have nothing to say 
<br>
about the other points that were not posted since I don't know what they 
<br>
are. They cannot make the four points that were posted &quot;true&quot; in their 
<br>
specific claims, and unless the capsized summaries were greatly 
<br>
misrepresented, reading the full points won't show them to be true either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;[re]: first let's see the credibility of the person making the claims.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[citing totally unrelated matter of artificial structures on Mars]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         This is the unscientific technique called &quot;discrediting by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;association&quot;. If you can't win an argument on merit, attack your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opponent on some other issue where he/she seems vulnerable. Note that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the merits of that side issue are not raised either. This is an attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to discredit an opponent purely by association, without any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;consideration of the merit of either issue. Recognize the tactic for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what it is.
</em><br>
<p>You conveniently didn't quote the first part of my sentence:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The specific claims must be addressed, but first let's see the credibility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the person making the claims.
</em><br>
<p>The claims have to stand or fall on their own merits, regardless of the 
<br>
person making the claims. But by showing you have already made patently 
<br>
false claims about artificial structures on Mars, it demonstrates that your 
<br>
credibility is so low that anything you say has to be independently 
<br>
verified before anyone can believe it. It is like the difference between 
<br>
what Consumer Reports claims for a car and what a car salesman claims for 
<br>
it. We do not trust the latter without independent verification.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;[sf article]: The Big Bang predicts that equal amounts of matter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;antimatter were created. If so, we don't know what happened to all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;antimatter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[re]: The Big Bang makes no such prediction. The BB says nothing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this. You may as well complain that the BB fails to explain why Mars is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;red. The resolution of the problem will be in an as yet undeveloped
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unifying theory like a Grand Unified Theory. We already know that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nuclear weak force is asymmetric. The weak force is probably involved
</em><br>
<em>&gt;with the resolution of the problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         The Big Bang predicts that equal amounts of matter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;antimatter were created in the initial explosion. Matter dominates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;present universe apparently because of some form of asymmetry, such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;CP violation asymmetry, that caused most anti-matter to annihilate with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;matter, but left much matter. Experiments are searching for evidence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this asymmetry, so far without success. Other galaxies can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;antimatter because that would create a matter-antimatter boundary with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the intergalactic medium that would create gamma rays, which are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seen. [Sources: Sci.News 158, 86 (2000); Science 278, 226 (1997).]
</em><br>
<p>The basic Big Bang theory, in and of itself, is an incomplete theory. This 
<br>
has long been recognized. It is the reason why auxiliary theories to fill 
<br>
in the missing details, like inflation, were developed. There are a few 
<br>
other competing ones to inflation as well, such as ekpyrotic universe, fast 
<br>
speed of light, and complicated superspace universe. All of these make 
<br>
specific predictions that can be verified or falsified. And they in turn 
<br>
rely on some auxiliary theories, particularly those governing the behavior 
<br>
of matter and energy at extremes well removed from everyday life or even 
<br>
anything going on in the universe today.
<br>
<p>The resolution of the problem of the matter-antimatter asymmetry is to be 
<br>
found in one of these auxiliary theories, not the BB. There is no mechanism 
<br>
outlined in the BB that addresses the point. For that reason it is a false 
<br>
and deceptive claim that this asymmetry falsifies the BB.
<br>
<p>The BB can be falsified on its specific mechanisms and predictions. For 
<br>
example, there is a period in time early in the history of the universe 
<br>
where the temperature range that is coupled with the expansion  due to the 
<br>
BB allows for the formation of the hydrogen, helium and their isotopes that 
<br>
we see in the universe today. Their ratios to one another are predicted by 
<br>
the calculations done for this nuclear synthesis era. These predicted 
<br>
ratios have been verified by observations. Had they not been, the BB would 
<br>
have been falsified.
<br>
<p>Your reasoning is like someone coming upon burnt remains on a lot and 
<br>
complaining that there cannot have been a house there that burned down 
<br>
since the remains are of a circular structure and houses are always square. 
<br>
Houses can be built square but they don't have to be. The lack of 
<br>
squareness doesn't mean there was no house because squareness is not an 
<br>
invariant prediction of houses. Likewise  matter-antimatter symmetry is not 
<br>
an invariant prediction of the basic BB, and its lack doesn't mean there 
<br>
was no BB.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;[sf article]: The Big Bang violates the First Law of Thermodynamics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;by requiring that new space in the expanding universe be filled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;zero-point&quot; energy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[re]: Another false claim. The conservation of energy has to hold in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;local conditions. There is no requirement under general relativity that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it has to hold under global conditions. See
</em><br>
<em>&gt;<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html</a>. As
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for zero point energy, if by that term you mean the net energy balance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provided by virtual particles, as above the BB says nothing about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         The Big Bang violates the first law of thermodynamics, that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy cannot be either created or destroyed, by requiring that new
</em><br>
<em>&gt;space filled with &quot;zero-point energy&quot; (the Casimir effect) be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;continually created between the galaxies. Wherever that new space and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;energy appears is &quot;local&quot; to that place, and clearly violates the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;law. [Source: B.R. Bligh, &quot;The Big Bang Exploded!&quot; (2000),
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&lt;<a href="mailto:brbligh@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20(SK)%20Re:%20The%20bottom%20two-thirds%20of%20a%20cosmological%20iceberg%20?">brbligh@hotmail.com</a>&gt;.]
</em><br>
<p>You either haven't read the reference link I provided or you didn't 
<br>
understand it. The Casimir effect isn't zero point energy, it is an 
<br>
imbalance in zero point energy and it only comes into play under the 
<br>
special condition when two metal objects are placed extremely close to one 
<br>
another. The Casimir effect isn't found otherwise. The quantum fluctuations 
<br>
that provide the background for the Casimir effect cancel out in normal 
<br>
local conditions and provide zero net energy. For this reason there is no 
<br>
violation of the first law locally. Globally there could be a violation of 
<br>
the conservation of energy, but this is allowed under General Relativity. 
<br>
Provide a reference to a peer reviewed scientific journal where it isn't 
<br>
allowed under General Relativity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;[sf article]: Redshifts are quantized for both galaxies and quasars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;as are some other properties of the galaxies. All this is verboten under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Big Bang rules.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[re]: Yet another false claim. Redshifts are not quantized. This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from the December 2002 Sky and Telescope:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         The fact that redshifts are quantized for nearby galaxies had
</em><br>
<em>&gt;already been confirmed in an earlier independent study. The new study
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(quoting a news article dated *after* the top 30 list was published)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;does not distinguish between these two conflicting results.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Quantization also occurs for quasars and for properties of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;galaxies other than redshift. None of these should happen under Big Bang
</em><br>
<em>&gt;premises. [Sources: Astrophys.J. 393, 59-67 (1992); Guthrie &amp; Napier,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mon.Not.Roy.Astr.Soc. 12/1 issue (1991); Astron.J. 121, 21-30 (2001);
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Astron.&amp;Astrophys. 343, 697-704 (1999).]
</em><br>
<p>This is a sterling example of why your credibility is zero and you are not 
<br>
to be believed without independent verification. Let's take these one by one.
<br>
<p>Astrophys.J. 393, 59-67 (1992)
<br>
<p>This is the only reference you've given that supports your claim in some 
<br>
fashion. The trouble is, this is old news. The analysis is of a few hundred 
<br>
or so galaxies out of a prior 1983 data set. In contrast, the 2dF redshift 
<br>
surveys of galaxies and quasars recently done analyses 1,647 galaxy-quasar 
<br>
pairs, with no sign of any quantized redshifts. It's an old trick of cranks 
<br>
to use obsolete data to support their claims.
<br>
<p>Guthrie &amp; Napier, Mon.Not.Roy.Astr.Soc. 12/1 issue (1991)
<br>
<p>Invalid reference. The volume, page number and year don't give any match 
<br>
for this journal in the library database, and physically checking the 
<br>
journal shows this is an invalid format.
<br>
<p>Astron.J. 121, 21-30 (2001)
<br>
<p>Invalid reference. The volume, page number and year don't give any match 
<br>
for this journal in the library database, and physically checking the 
<br>
journal shows this is an invalid match.
<br>
<p>Astron.&amp;Astrophys. 343, 697-704 (1999)
<br>
<p>This is a paper about discrete states of galactic *rotation curves*, NOT 
<br>
radial redshifts.
<br>
<p>All in all, your evidence for quantized redshifts is zero.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&gt;[sf article]: Big Bang theory requires that the fine-structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;constant must vary with time; a claimed but controversial phenomenon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[re]: See? It's a whole list of make believe claims. The BB says
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing at all about the fine structure constant.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         Under Big Bang premises (specifically, if quasars are at their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;redshift distances), the fine structure constant must vary with time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[Source: Phys.Rev.Lett. 9/03 issue (2001).]
</em><br>
<p>And all houses must be red or they're not houses. Your argument is false 
<br>
for the reasons given above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;[re]: This is the guy who also insists that gravity doesn't travel at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the speed of light and can't get out of a black hole. See [two links]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the refutations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;         But why neglect to cite the latest publication on this matter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which (unlike the two web sites) is peer-reviewed?
</em><br>
<p>The web sites are written for general public use by mathematical physicists 
<br>
who have their own numerous publications in peer reviewed journals and who 
<br>
are generally highly respected by their peers. And there are reference 
<br>
citations to papers in peer reviewed academic journals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This article not only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;answers those objections to the satisfaction of reviewers and editors,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but does the same for every objection raised to date, and concludes with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unchallenged reasoning that the &quot;universal speed limit&quot; is no longer in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect in physics. See [&quot;Experimental Repeal of the Speed Limit for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Gravitational, Electrodynamic, and Quantum Field Interactions&quot;, T. Van
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Flandern and J.P. Vigier, Found.Phys. 32(#7), 1031-1068 (2002)].
</em><br>
<p>I guess that's supposed to be Foundational Physics. If so, like Science 
<br>
Frontiers it is not an academic journal and the University of California 
<br>
library doesn't carry it. Whatever reviewers you are referring to, it is 
<br>
highly likely that they are not mathematical physicists or general 
<br>
relativists with positions at academic institutions in those fields. If one 
<br>
crank peer reviews another crank, it means nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     Now if I have grasped the essence of Ebert's reasoning, I should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;be able to apply his same type of arguments to my own advantage: A
</em><br>
<em>&gt;respected, senior physicist has joined me as a co-author of a carefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scrutinized publication in a prestigious mainstream physics journal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;containing a result of importance to physics. Because that result has
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the weight of undisputed authority, everyone should now pay attention to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;my Big Bang arguments, and can safely conclude that there probably *are*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artificial structures on Mars. Right? :-) -|Tom|-
</em><br>
<p>You haven't published in any mainstream physics journal, let alone a 
<br>
prestigious one, on this subject. I understand you are respected as a 
<br>
celestial mechanic who is able to accurately work out comet, asteroidal and 
<br>
planetary orbits, but your understanding of relativity and quantum 
<br>
mechanics is infantile and you have no hope of getting your claims on them 
<br>
published in an academic physics journal.
