<p><em>&gt; I'd like to hear the opinion of some of the very bright people on this

<em>&gt; list, do you think Saddam Hussein is alive?
</em><br>
<p>Who's to know?
<br>
<p>I would expect Iraqi resistance to falter quickly once Hussein was
<br>
dead.  Arguably, his lieutenants might decide to keep up the façade
<br>
of him being alive in order to preserve their own power.  But then
<br>
again the experience with other dictators of this kind (Stalin,
<br>
Ceaucescu) tells us that they do not surround themselves with that
<br>
sort of smart and ambitious people, because those would be just the
<br>
kind to potentially lead a coup d'état.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It has now been one week since a bunker the CIA thought he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in was destroyed
</em><br>
<p>The CIA may have erred, the report of the destruction of the bunker
<br>
may be a canard, or he may have been simply lucky.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and he must know about rumors floating around that he's dead or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; badly injured, and those rumors can only weaken his regime, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if he's alive and healthy I can't figure out why he doesn't put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a stop to them.
</em><br>
<p>But he does.  He appears on TV.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but all we've heard from Mr. Hussein is generic speeches that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have been taped a month before fighting started,
</em><br>
<p>But do you think his fervent supporters will share this doubt?
<br>
(BTW, have you actually seen any of his speeches?  Everybody here
<br>
who understands Arabic, please raise your hand.)
<br>
<p>If those claims about his doubles are true, ascertaining that any
<br>
incarnation of him the Coalition forces manage to get hold of dead
<br>
or alive is the real one will be fun.  They'll have to round up the
<br>
whole family--remember, his sons are said to have multiple doubles,
<br>
too--and do a mass DNA comparison.
<br>
<p>The most hilarious thing that could happen would be Hussein pulling
<br>
another Usama bin Ladin, disappearing, possibly dead, possibly
<br>
alive, a phantom.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; including praise for his army's 51's division that surrendered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the opening hours of the war and no longer exists.
</em><br>
<p>According to the Russians, that surrender is a complete propaganda
<br>
fabrication.  Whom are we to believe?
<br>
<p>One of the TV commentators here explained that Hussein disappeared
<br>
during the previous Gulf War, too, only to reappear unharmed in the
<br>
end.  I don't recall that in any detail.
<br>
<p>There is also the proposal that Hussein has been wounded.  Which
<br>
would neatly explain pre-recorded TV appearances (showing a wounded
<br>
leader would be demoralizing) and continued resistance (as long as
<br>
he's alive, his regime will not falter).
<br>
<p>It's all idle speculation.  Have some patience.  It will take a few
<br>
years anyway before we'll have a chance to learn with some confidence
<br>
what truly happened during this war.
