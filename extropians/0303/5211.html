<p>Yes, as long as we have tribes, and tribes are the highest unit of social
<br>
identity and political life, I have my preference for my tribe, and other 
<br>
tribes similar to it. But the tribesmen of the very different tribes also 
<br>
prefer *their* tribe and tribes similar to it - the ones who hate
<br>
democracy, freedom, and secular lifestyles. There are some in our tribe
<br>
who would prefer to belong to their tribe and vice versa, but all in all,
<br>
preferences for tribe have an eerie correlation with tribe
<br>
membership. Tribesmen tend to like their own tribe.
<br>
<p>'Why are they so different? Wouldn't they like to be a tribe more like
<br>
ours? Wouldn't they like to join our tribe, and become like us? By being
<br>
different, they are limiting us, they are endangering us. They might even
<br>
dare to think they will make us like them! Our tribe must at least survive
<br>
and prosper - therefore we will expand and attack the other tribe.'
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And then compare that world to the one in which the strongest world power is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a democratic constitutional republic which embraces (albiet tribalistically)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such values as free speech, rule of law, and individual civil liberties, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *at least* orders of magnitude greater levels than any of the other systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out there.
</em><br>
<p>I have problems with my own tribe's lack of certain civil liberties, and
<br>
its rule of law tends to put me at certain disadvantages. True, all in
<br>
all, I still prefer my tribe to almost any other. But then, not everybody
<br>
is like me. Not in my tribe, and not in all the tribes of the
<br>
world. Sometimes I have more in common with people from different
<br>
tribes. Sometimes they have it better than me, sometimes I have it better
<br>
than them. Sometimes they're more like me, sometimes less. Sometimes they
<br>
may stand to benefit me in some way, sometimes not, and sometimes they
<br>
may stand to harm me. There is no simple rule. But if we start thinking
<br>
outside of the box of tribalism, we can start to think of ways in which we
<br>
can communicate in more reliably helpful ways, finding connections where
<br>
we wouldn't have otherwise, and all of us helping one another get to a
<br>
condition we would like to be in. I do believe it's possible, in theory.
