<p>
Let me just make a few general remarks: I objected to your
<br>
classification of &quot;economic force&quot; as &quot;violence&quot; for very practical
<br>
reasons. I judge all actions by their long-term outcomes. To reliably
<br>
achieve desired outcomes in interactions involving large numbers of
<br>
participants, simple rules and clear-cut definitions are paramount
<br>
(although not sufficient). For practical purposes, conflating violence
<br>
(as I previously defined it) with non-violent exchanges, in the attempt
<br>
to include all of the world's complexity in the decision-making, leads
<br>
to discretion, arbitrariness and confusion, rather than improved
<br>
outcomes.
<br>
<p>If everybody knows that killing his neighbor will be punished, even if
<br>
you claim temporary insanity due to the economic coercion by Twinkies
<br>
manufacturers, the outcome will be less murder. If you know that selling
<br>
goods will not be redefined as &quot;violent exploitation of the poor&quot;, you
<br>
will invest in the future of your business, with you and your customers
<br>
getting richer. 
<br>
<p>Weakening such simple rules brings ruin to a society.

<em>&gt; Well, here's a more analytical definition, though it depends on the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; though, because it would seemingly exclude things such as deception and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical threats of harm.
</em><br>
<p>### These are &quot;deception&quot; and &quot;physical threats&quot; - concepts separate
<br>
from &quot;violence&quot;, although related in being in most cases undesirable.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I would consider the latter &quot;indirect&quot; to some
<br>
<em>&gt; extent (your drug example I would consider fairly &quot;direct&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But - my point is not that you don't know what you would consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;violent&quot; - obviously, you do. But my point is that it is better to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attention to all the forces that are interacting, and evaluate the ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall. Economic forces can harm people, they can be consciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed, etc., so there is no reason they cannot be understood as part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the problem (?) of violence.
</em><br>
<p>### I disagree here explicitly. For the practical purposes of devising a
<br>
legal system, simplicity is of the utmost importance. The basic
<br>
concepts, like &quot;violence&quot;, must be clearly defined, so that unequivocal
<br>
decisions can be made in most cases, with minimal discretion. Allowing
<br>
an infinite number of &quot;interacting forces&quot; to enter into the analysis is
<br>
highly counterproductive. Since &quot;economic forces&quot; are not violent, the
<br>
legal apparatus designed to deal with violence (criminal law) should not
<br>
be used in the areas best left to civil law, non-violent interactions
<br>
between people.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Does a suicide bomber consent to committing suicide?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Yes, presently it is so, although in the future it might be possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to produce suicide bombers by direct neural stimulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, right here I would break it down - there are parts of the mind that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may consent to suicide, but there are other parts that don't (my folk use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of consent). Thus, the suicide bombers sweat and &quot;seem nervous&quot;, which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take as evidence of their inner conflict. There is no homogeneous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self&quot; and thus no unified &quot;consent&quot;. To the extent that the bomber
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (*any* part of his mind) cannot control all the forces acting upon and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shaping his mind, his &quot;consent&quot; is not arising from some transcendent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operational base; it is embedded in the universe at large, its play of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all forces. Some of those forces can be economic (desire for family to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paid a martyr's award, resentment over poverty, training by funded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide-bomber-makers, funding of means of ubiquitous exposure to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auxiliary religiemes, purchase of bomb materials, etc.)
</em><br>
<p>### Again, for the sake of practical workability, only the final
<br>
outcomes of cognitive acts can usefully be subject matter of
<br>
distinctions between consensual and non-consensual acts (aside from
<br>
direct neural control), since only this focus allows appropriate, simple
<br>
rules for behavior modification. The history of being exposed to some
<br>
nebulous forces, purportedly removing one's ability to make independent
<br>
decisions, cannot be used in a workable legal system as an extenuating
<br>
circumstance.
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p>.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Partially, by hanging out in the wrong places and listening to false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prophets. This is essentially irrelevant to the two initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; questions,since almost all humans are exposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; suicide-bomber-philosophy, yet only a very small minority actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consent to suicide bombing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, we're not all exposed to the philosophy. I myself have never seen it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly stated at length by its devotees. The same applies to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;wrong places&quot; (?); many people like myself have never been to a place
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where it was taught, or heard anyone preach it in person.  Ditto for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; auxiliary factors - my family and friends have not belonged to a religion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety in which it was taught at all, or done it.
</em><br>
<p>### You made a decision not to seek more enlightenment. You are not a
<br>
suicide bomber by your own will.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Does he consent to only two products of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sort he wants being available?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Explain. You mean I get to determine every company's product line?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, partially.
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Does he consent to only one product being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; sold practically near to him?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Yes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now I control the distribution of stores and their goods?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, partially.
<br>
<p>------------------&gt; 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ### It is still not possible to program humans. As a result, marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does not make anybody to anything - it merely influences choices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; non-violently, e.g. by informing about the existence of a product and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; price comparisons, and allowing superior choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If any marketing strategy has EVER been successful, then it has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effectively programmed human behvior. The fact that such programming may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be highly unreliable and distracted by other programming and environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; factors in most cases does not change that fact.
</em><br>
<p>### Allowing the claim that &quot;Twinkies made me do it&quot; would lead to
<br>
undesirable social outcomes, so it must be rejected. 
<br>
<p><p>---------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Does he consent to receiving marketing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; influences?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Almost always yes, except in some unusual circumstances (children
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exposed to marketing at school, etc.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I determine if and when/where I see billboards' ads and magazine ads and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TV ads?
</em><br>
<p>### With the exception of billboards, you do. Remember, you don't need
<br>
to see the ads or even watch TV.
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Does he consent to acquiring the characteristics that make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; marketing effective?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### Explain?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do people consent to having a hunger motive, or a taste for choclate, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that chocolate ice cream sellers can effectively sell chocolate sundaes to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many people?
</em><br>
<p>### Some people do not. Can you plausibly call a chocolate vendor
<br>
&quot;violent&quot; for catering to this taste?
<br>
<p><pre>
--
&gt; 
&gt; Ethics is a branch of aesthetics.
### ? According to all the dictionaries I consulted, these are separate
domains of inquiry.
------------------------
 But - using violence to prevent
&gt; violence? is an oxymoron. 
### Not an oxymoron - reciprocity.
-------------------------
 Not that I don't understand your drift (I
&gt; think). We can use one force to try to prevent another force. Some forces
&gt; can enable or disable certain other forces. One man's nonviolence
&gt; (embargo, imprisonment) is another man's violence - prompting
&gt; &quot;self-defense&quot; etc.
### Embargo and imprisonment involve a threat of violence, and by
reciprocity allow the use of violent means to defend oneself against.
--------------------------------
 It would be better for ethics to at least first
&gt; analyze what all the operating forces are, before it decides to label this
&gt; or that pejoratively or amelioratively. In fact, gross-level category
&gt; labeling may be counterproductive altogether.
### On the contrary, defining simple categories is indispensable in real
life decision-making.
