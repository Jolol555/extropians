You're twisting reality here. 13 to 16 year old humans are sensitive enough to know what a war is. If freedom and peace loving schoolboys and girls organise a protest ralley against a US killing campaign and their teachers allow them to leave one hour earlier, you come along with your paranoid patriotism and compare it with Nazi teachers urging the boys to sign up for the Wehrmacht????

<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Straight out of Remarque's All Quiet On the Western Front&quot; where the schoolteacher, Kantorek, goaded the boys into signing up for the Wehrmacht! Too funny and too similar! So much for thinking for ourselves.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;So much for spontaneity.  Now we understand where these volunteers are
