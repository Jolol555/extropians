<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think it fair to say, and quite obviously,  that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he [Nixon] believed when making decisions, as I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think is the case with most of our chief executives,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was acting in the best interest of the people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States.
</em><br>
<p>I'm wondering how much this statement holds up to close
<br>
inspection when taken literally.
<br>
<p>On the plus side, it occurs to me that as human beings
<br>
easily and often identify with projects, goals, and
<br>
groups much &quot;larger&quot; than themselves---think suicide
<br>
bomber for an extreme illustration---then it's not out
<br>
of the question by any means that this statement is
<br>
literally correct.
<br>
<p>Yet, on the other hand, how can such behavior (in so
<br>
many cases) be distinguished from self-interest?
<br>
In the present context, wouldn't you just about give
<br>
your right arm to be able to historically eaves-drop
<br>
on conversations at the highest levels where there was
<br>
a trade-off between what was ostensibly and clearly
<br>
in the interest of the nation, and what was in the
<br>
interest of the leader and his advisors having the
<br>
discussion?
<br>
<p>If anyone knows of particular examples, I would very
<br>
much like to hear about them.
<br>
<p>Recently, I have listed as the *top* priority of 
<br>
executives in modern democracies the object of 
<br>
getting re-elected.  Though true, (and I'm wondering
<br>
if I have been too cynical), it's also very likely
<br>
that the highly partisan individuals who succeed to
<br>
high office deeply believe that almost the worst 
<br>
thing that could befall their nation would be to let
<br>
the political opposition start running things!
<br>
<p>(So you see, in this case, &quot;getting re-elected&quot; and
<br>
&quot;acting in the best interest of the nation&quot; amount to
<br>
the same thing.  From their perspective, of course.)
<br>
<p>Thoughts?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
