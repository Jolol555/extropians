<p><em>&gt;No need to coerce people, just give them a chance to convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt;everybody that their memes are the best (according to some values)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;on a free memetic market.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how it could be any other way. A human being has such a
<br>
rich mix of philosophies, experiences, intellects, skills, desires, goals,
<br>
prejudices, emotions, etc., that, in my opinion, all anyone can do
<br>
if they want to 'teach' an idea in a nonacademic setting is:
<br>
<p>1) be an example,
<br>
2) 'plant seeds' for ideas
<br>
<p>The notion of 'Converting a meme-set' is completely against my
<br>
ethics and as coersive as I can imagine. If you think of an idea as
<br>
a seed that germinates and grows, then either a person has the
<br>
internal 'soil' where that seed will germinate, or he/she doesn't.
<br>
It's very cool if they do take to it, but if the soil is not right
<br>
for that idea then it's not right, and that's all. Find a way to
<br>
present that idea (or 'be' that idea), and let it go. If that person
<br>
likes the idea then they'll return to you with questions.
<br>
<p>So while I've been practicing the above for 20+ years, the Sufis
<br>
have been practicing a much richer way to present ideas for 1000+
<br>
years. Their way uses a presentation method which I call 'picture
<br>
word concepts'. Even though the Sufis are a poor fit in a Moslem
<br>
mosque, they are a perfect fit in the Arabic language, and this is
<br>
one of the most important reasons they have for choosing Arabic
<br>
as their primary language to express their concepts (as I
<br>
understand these people).
<br>
<p>The Sufis don't use *one* word to concisely present an idea, they
<br>
let the Arabic language concisely present an 'impression' via the
<br>
roots of a word. You start with a particular Arabic word, extract
<br>
the root, then generate/expand more words from the root. These
<br>
special words with the  roots describe a complex set of ideas which
<br>
accord with a number of Sufi ideas and practices, and build up, on
<br>
close examination, a 'word picture'. With the meanings taken together,
<br>
the word carries a message or composite presentation of certain
<br>
essentials. It extends the dimensions of meaning, through the word
<br>
and its derivatives, and acts like an impression.
<br>
<p>For example, the Sufi traveler belongs to a 'tariqa'. This word
<br>
means: course, rule of life, order of dervishes. The nearest
<br>
approximation  to the sense of this word is 'way' in English, the
<br>
way of doing a thing, the way upon which a person is traveling, the
<br>
way as an individual. But there's much more meaning to this word for
<br>
the Sufis.  The root is (TaRiQa). Now expand the TRQ root:
<br>
<p>TaRQ = sound of a musical instrument
<br>
TaTaRRaQ Li = to aim at, to wish, to draw near to
<br>
ATRaQ = to remain silent with downcast eyes
<br>
TaRRaQ Li = to open the way to
<br>
TaRaQ = to come to anyone by night
<br>
TuRQaT  = way, road; method; habit
<br>
TaRIQAt = lofty palm tree
<br>
<p>So for the Sufis, the tariqa is the Path in which resides the
<br>
transmission. It is a rule of living, a thin line within ordinary
<br>
life, sometimes maintained through the note of music, expressed
<br>
visually by the palm tree. The tariqa itself opens the Path, and it
<br>
is connected with meditation, silent thinking, as when a man sits in
<br>
quiet contemplation in the silence of the darkness. It is both the
<br>
aim and the method.
<br>
<p>So do you see how this 'scattering' method creates an whole
<br>
impression on the disparate elements of the human mind?
<br>
I think it's lovely.
