<p>
Hubert Mania supplied an URL to an extensive article on the Patriot
<br>
Act created by the ACLU, an avowed opponent of that Act.
<br>
<p>I list the *four* most troublesome things that I could find in it,
<br>
but upon closer examination could not identify anything in particular
<br>
to be alarmed about.  Consider any country.  Were one to read through
<br>
the volumes and volumes of German law, wouldn't one find many
<br>
potentially troubling items?
<br>
<p>I'll give you one.  A few years ago our company was working on
<br>
a voicemail system that might be used in Germany.  We were informed
<br>
that we probably were going to have to provide a secret back-door
<br>
so that the German Authorities could, if need be, surreptitiously
<br>
listen to anyone's voicemail.  We refused.  As it turned out we
<br>
didn't get the contract; a certain other nation's company got the
<br>
contract, one for whom this may not have been a problem.  Now the
<br>
deals were very complicated, and I do not know for sure if this
<br>
was really a significant issue or not---all I know is that at one
<br>
point this issue came up.
<br>
<p>So are we to conclude that Germany is descending into a police
<br>
state?  Are we to suppose that this incident, and probably many
<br>
similar to it in a nation of 84 million people, are something to
<br>
become extremely excited about?
<br>
<p>I would say no.  I would say that German citizens are vastly better
<br>
protected than people in most nations.  Along with the U.S. and 
<br>
most other Western nations, the legal rights of Germans are very
<br>
good.
<br>
<p>So Hubert now writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Concerning the draft of Patriot Act Two.  Lee said amongst
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other delicately elaborated comments:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So I delved further into the document where each of these is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; described in more detail.  I found nothing alarming after all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Okay, now I've done my part.  You tell me just *where* there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is something here that we should discuss!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have come to know you as a sincere person, Lee, and I am interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further discussion,
</em><br>
<p>Thank you.  Same here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but if your alarm clocks are NOT ringing when reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the draft of Patriot Act II, this probably has to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the shape of your reality tunnel,
</em><br>
<p>That may be so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; while my tunnel of reality has been shaped into being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more suspicious of Government plans to deprive their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens of their freedom in exchange for a security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they cannot provide at all.  At the first signs of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such plans I am up the barricades while you probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are still thinking you are on the safe side because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are such a good citizen.
</em><br>
<p>There is some truth to this:  I would not be the first people
<br>
to be taken away to the camps.  But I know of hundreds of
<br>
people---quite a number of them personally, and they know
<br>
thousands of people.  Who has anything concrete to report
<br>
that they are alarmed about?
<br>
<p>But it is *not* my own personal safety that I am concerned
<br>
with.  Suppose that anyone I knew or had heard of was 
<br>
being arrested for their opinions.  That would be completely
<br>
different!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just imagine a revengeful neighbor denounces you....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... I can't do nothing to convince you.
</em><br>
<p>Hubert, I am very disappointed that you did not choose to discuss
<br>
any specific with me.  Evidently, you read through the entire
<br>
ACLU criticism of the Patriot Act, and you just got a bad &quot;feeling&quot;.
<br>
<p>Why won't you look through it again, and the first time that
<br>
you find something *concrete*, please tell me.  (Or, preferably,
<br>
why don't you find the most alarming thing?)
<br>
<p>Lee
