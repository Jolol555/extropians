<em>&gt;&gt; So, *why* the blazes is the ExI list debating IRAQ when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it should be debating caloric intake? 
</em><br>
<p>I agree that deaths attributable to obesity will probably outnumber the
<br>
deaths attributable to war.
<br>
<p>But with all the psychological pressure this society places on people
<br>
who are obese today, anybody who hasn't got the message yet that being
<br>
overweight is hazardous to one's health doesn't want to get the message.
<br>
<p>We can't legislate calorie intake in a free society.
<br>
<p>The only other alternative is to develop safer more effective weight
<br>
loss methods and make them available to the general public.
<br>
<p>The drug companies are working feverishly on this every day.  American
<br>
spend billions on weight loss drugs, over the counter supplements, diet
<br>
programs and fitness programs.  Most of this money spent is largely
<br>
ineffective or the products use must be discontinued due to cost.  What
<br>
drug company wouldn't want to corner the market with an effective, safe,
<br>
weight loss drug.  I would bet that obesity is much more prevalent with
<br>
the low-income and unemployed segment of the population for many
<br>
reasons.  Lower self-esteem, inability to afford the above mentioned
<br>
semi-effective solutions, the tendency for inactivity when you can't
<br>
afford to leave the house.
<br>
<p>The media is coming out now attacking Ephedra due to a few highly
<br>
publicized deaths that have been attributed to it.  What I want to know
<br>
is if the FDA takes Ephedra based products off of the shelves how many
<br>
more people will die of obesity each year.
<br>
<p>I have heard of schools becoming involved and calling in parents for
<br>
counseling if their child is significantly overweight.  This may work in
<br>
a few cases but what do you do if the eating patterns of the child are
<br>
learned from those of the parents.
<br>
<p>What are doctors now recommending as the most effective weight loss
<br>
method.  We all know that proper nutrition and exercise is key.  But
<br>
food seems to fill both a emotional and biochemical need within the
<br>
human brain.  Many people eat more to alleviate boredom or create a
<br>
release of serotonin the pleasure chemical in the brain.
<br>
<p>In the last year I have decreased my appetite and lost about 35 lbs.
<br>
without really experiencing hunger or increasing my level of physical
<br>
activity.  I attribute the weight loss to my use of 5-HTP and Sam-E as a
<br>
substitute for prescription antidepressants.  I am not attempting to
<br>
start a new diet craze but rather am curious to hear if anyone else has
<br>
had the same experience.  I still enjoy eating, but if I'm on the
<br>
computer or doing something else enjoyable I don't find myself hungry.
<br>
Before I started taking these supplements I would get a headache if I
<br>
missed even one meal.  Now it seems I will only get a headache if I
<br>
forget to eat until say 3:00 PM in the afternoon.
