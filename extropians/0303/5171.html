Information Entropy and Correlations in Prime Numbers

<br>
<p>The difference between two consecutive prime numbers is called the
<br>
distance between primes. We study the statistical properties of the
<br>
distances and their increments (the difference between two consecutive
<br>
distances) for a sequence comprising the first $5\times 10^7$ prime numbers.
<br>
We observe that the sequence of distances and the sequence of increment
<br>
magnitudes both exhibit remarkable logarithmic trends. We obtain an
<br>
empirical form for the information entropy for the set of distances as a
<br>
function of sequence length $N_p$, and a very similar form for the
<br>
information entropy for the set of corresponding increments. We find that
<br>
for a given $N_p$, the entropy of the set of increments is always greater
<br>
than the entropy of the set of distances, suggesting a greater variability
<br>
in the values of the increments. We also find that the histograms of the
<br>
distances and the increments follow exponential distributions with
<br>
superposed periodic behavior with different periods: period-three
<br>
oscillations for the magnitude of increments similar to previously reported
<br>
period-six oscillations for the distances. We further investigate the
<br>
correlations between the distances as well as their increments and find that
<br>
at small and intermediate scales the distances exhibit a weak power-law
<br>
anticorrelation followed by a crossover to strongly correlated behavior at
<br>
large scales. This crossover is due to the logarithmic trend in the sequence
<br>
of distances. For the increments, we find that (i) they are strongly
<br>
anticorrelated at all scales, (ii) their magnitudes exhibit a crossover from
<br>
weakly anticorrelated behavior at small scales to strongly correlated
<br>
behavior at large scales, and (iii) their signs are anticorrelated at small
<br>
scales and uncorrelated at large scales.
