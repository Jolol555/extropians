In a message dated 3/29/2003 8:37:30 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu?Subject=Re:%20Nature%20of%20Ideology%20(was%20RE:%20More%20enthusiasm%20than%20news%20in%20Fox's%20coverage%20o...">phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu</a> quotes Lee Corbin: &quot;My other theory is that the left 
<br>
has inherited a tradition, or aspects of a tradition, that goes all the way 
<br>
back to Lenin.  In revolutionary Russia, Lenin and his followers labeled 
<br>
themselves the Bolsheviks, or &quot;Majority&quot;.  It was a conscious..&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then he chips in in reply, &quot;Lenin is not part of the memetic history 
<br>
of most US liberals.  Really, he's not.  This may be hard to accept if you're 
<br>
someone like Dehede who likes to slather &quot;socialist&quot; all around, but it's 
<br>
true.  There may be some common roots between Lenis and social democracy, 
<br>
going back to the first people outraged at the condition of the poor in the 
<br>
19th century, but that's it.  This &quot;Bolshevik&quot; connection is a fantasy.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Earlier today one of the list members was discussing the difference 
<br>
between the left and the right.  I have observed one of the differences is 
<br>
that the communists and socialists never like to admit their political 
<br>
beliefs.  Instead we keep getting the latest nom de jour made up of the same 
<br>
old leftovers from socialism/communism.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mention that, &quot;There may be some common roots between Lenin and 
<br>
social democracy, going back to the first people outraged at the condition of 
<br>
the poor in the 19th century.&quot;  Please consult any history of the communist 
<br>
movement.  Lenin came straight out of the socialist movement and changed the 
<br>
label to differentiate his brand of socialism from the earlier form.  All 
<br>
during the Soviet lifetime they referred to themselves as socialists time 
<br>
without number.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would not have intruded here if you had not included me in a 
<br>
discussion you were having with Lee.  I shall now turn you back to him.
<br>
Ron h.
