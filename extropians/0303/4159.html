<em>&gt; Mike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Do you suppose the Iraqi have organized sailplane clubs yet?
</em><br>
<p>They have radio controlled model airplane clubs, rather, to train young
<br>
Iraqis in piloting UAVs armed with chemical and biological weapons with
<br>
ranges in excess of 350 km. We know that Iraq has these UAV's, we have
<br>
pictures of them, and even Blix acknowledged them in a buried section
<br>
of his latest report that was originally only available to Security
<br>
Council members (but now shown on Fox News). 
<br>
<p>Being portable, with quick assembly features, they can be hidden in the
<br>
backs of small trucks and transported around the countryside free from
<br>
the prying eyes of satellites or surveillance drones (and UN weapons
<br>
inspectors).
<br>
<p>THese are the Stukas of the new Reich.
<br>
<p>They have converted L-39 trainer jet drop tanks into cluster bombs
<br>
built to carry chem/bio submunitions for increased dispersal
<br>
effectiveness. These also Blix has acknowledged the existence of but
<br>
denies that these are evidence that Iraq has chem/bio weapons (why else
<br>
would they build them if they didn't have such?)
<br>
<p>A defector from the Republican Guard just yesterday detailed Saddam's
<br>
war plans, that he plans to attack allied troops with the chemical
<br>
weapons he claims he doesn't have. He also said that the UN inspectors
<br>
are just not looking hard enough for such weapons. Other observers have
<br>
also reported that Saddam is boobytrapping his oil fields with
<br>
explosives, contrary to his claims of just a week ago in his interview
<br>
with Dan Rather, when he claimed he would never destroy Iraqs oil
<br>
fields or dams, that they belonged to 'the people'.
<br>
<p>This is pretty convincing evidence that Saddam is a lying bastard and
<br>
cannot be trusted to disarm whatsoever, that 'containment' isn't
<br>
working, and the only alternative is regime change.
<br>
<p>Chirac just yesterday admitted that Saddam wasn't complying with
<br>
resolution 1441 but that France would never under any circumstances
<br>
approve a resolution that would result in war, they would always veto
<br>
them. This is pretty convincing evidence that France is now allied with
<br>
Iraq, if it can not imagine any circumstances where it would approve of
<br>
or even abstain from a vote on war on Iraq.
<br>
<p>The foreign minister of Angola just yesterday stated that all of the
<br>
divisiveness in the UN was entirely the fault of France.
