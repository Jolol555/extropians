<p>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let's say it differently then.  Patents reduce the ability to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; innovate and to extend previous innovations.  This is seen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; especially clearly in the case of software patents.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extending previous innovations with new innovations are not restricted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by patent law, as anyone who has done patent research can attest. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any patent application the applier lists prior art that the innovator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; builds on with new innovations. Furthermore, because patents protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovators abilities to recoupe and earn a profit on their investment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they stimulate innovation. Stifling patents stifles innovation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore slows the amplification of freedom that technology creates.
</em><br>
<p>This is simply disingenuous.  It is a simple and undeniable fact
<br>
that a patent for a derivative invention will only be awarded if the
<br>
new invention crosses a certain threshhold of &quot;novelty&quot;.  If it is
<br>
not sufficiently novel, it is seen as an application of the previous
<br>
invention, and is forbidden.  One can argue that forbidding others
<br>
from making new applications of old inventions protects the market
<br>
for the older invention (assuming there is a market for it), but to
<br>
deny that the patent restricts the freedom of others is dishonest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, it is a matter of investment security. Investors want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invest in tangible assets. A patent is tangible, while a business plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to invest in an unprotected innovation is not tangible. Guess what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attracts the investment capital? The truly innovative get it while the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mere copycat with a slick marketing plan has to scrounge.
</em><br>
<p>Why is the &quot;innovation&quot; any more inherently valuable than a
<br>
&quot;slick marketing plan&quot;?  Don't they both create value in the market?
<br>
Aren't they both products of ingenuity and creativity?  Why should
<br>
we inherently value one over the other?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eliminating patent protections enhances market tendencies toward
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mercantilism and oligopolies.
</em><br>
<p>...and it also eliminates barriers to entry for small companies
<br>
that fight oligolopolies.
