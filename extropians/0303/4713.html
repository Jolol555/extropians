<br>
<p>Skim what the suspected conservatroll wrote. Is most of it about mere
<br>
current events and mere 20th century politics that has sod-all to do with
<br>
technologically transcending the petty limitations holding back human
<br>
potential? Have they posted precious little about favorite Extropian topics
<br>
like computers, AI, singularity, cryonics, life-extension, nanotech, biotech,
<br>
space travel, etc.? Have they, in fact, posted ANYTHING AT ALL about ANY topic
<br>
you consider to be Extropic?
<br>
<p>No? Well, as Sinead put it &quot;By their own words, they will be exposed.&quot;
<br>
<p>No matter how invitingly, temptingly, seductively WRONG posts by such
<br>
individuals are, it's serving their goals to reply, because it contributes
<br>
to taking the list further off topic. That's what trolls, by definition,
<br>
specialize in doing.
<br>
<p>Now, if only there were an &quot;Ignore&quot; feature on the BBS site, that would make
<br>
it easier to resist the temptation... maybe even a collaborative ignore, where
<br>
you can see how many other people are ignoring a particular email address, so
<br>
as to make the process of developing your own ignore list more efficient...
<br>
that would be pretty neat.
