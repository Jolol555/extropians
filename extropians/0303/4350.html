</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then the values would not change much from day to day and you'd have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a good idea of what to expect.  One paper I looked at which tried a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lab experiment on the GL process did it that way (although with only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5 participants).
</em><br>
<p>I saw another paper (<a href="http://www.iew.unizh.ch/wp/iewwp003.pdf">http://www.iew.unizh.ch/wp/iewwp003.pdf</a>) that also
<br>
repeated the experiment multiple times and saw the results converging.  
<br>
But the purpose of repetition was to see if people could learn to play the
<br>
game correctly (in other words whether they could eventually figure out
<br>
that they should play the Nash strategy). The average preference for the
<br>
public good was actually given to everyone ahead of time.
<br>
<p>It's not clear to me what would happen in a repeated game like this if the
<br>
average preference is not publicly known ahead of time. My game theory
<br>
skills are very rusty now. Not that they were that good to begin with. I
<br>
never managed to solve this repeated game with a number of periods greater
<br>
than 2: <a href="http://www.weidai.com/monopoly-memory.txt">http://www.weidai.com/monopoly-memory.txt</a>, and this game is much
<br>
simpler in that it only has two parties, and only one of them has a
<br>
preference that's not publicly known ahead of time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't think this works if we assume that no one person can wield that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much influence.  Consider a similar strategy in the private market: I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will hold off on doing my Christmas shopping until the last day, in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopes that sellers will drive their prices down due to the lack of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contribution to demand, then I will step in at the last minute and take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantage of the low prices.  Well, this strategy doesn't work because one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person's demand doesn't influence prices measurably.  In the same way, my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; twiddling my knob will not appreciably influence other people's settings.
</em><br>
<p>You can't carry over this intuition from the competitive market to the GL
<br>
mechanism, because the feedback mechanism in the latter operates very
<br>
differently from the former. When you turn the knob lower, that gives
<br>
incentives to everyone to turn their knobs lower, and that in turn gives
<br>
everyone incentives to turn their knobs even lower, etc., until the
<br>
effect finally dampens out. By the time it does, everyone's settings could
<br>
be significantly different from what they started out with. In contrast,
<br>
in a competitive market, when you refrain from buying and prices fall,
<br>
everyone else has an incentive to buy which drives prices back up,
<br>
so your action is mostly canceled out, instead of reinforced, by 
<br>
others.
