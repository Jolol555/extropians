<em>&gt; Trying to commit illegal acts by exploiting loopholes in the law is a

</em><br>
<p>There is a deeper problem here. Even when this kind of cat-and-mouse
<br>
schemes might protect you from the first (and maybe second) attempt at
<br>
prosecution, if they actually work the normal response is to change the
<br>
law instead. Usually this means that the law is generalized; instead of
<br>
outlawing a particular list of drugs, the law now outlaws anything
<br>
chemically like them or with the same effects (depending on
<br>
jurisdiction).  If you consider the law in the first place to be 
<br>
immoral, now the immoral law has become a rubber law allowing 
<br>
prosecution much more widely.
<br>
<p>Sometimes cat and mouse works. The Swedish newspaper Aftonbladet was too
<br>
critical of the conservative king and government during the 1830's, and
<br>
was repeatedly banned. So it was removed - and papers like &quot;The Second
<br>
Aftonbladet&quot;, &quot;The New Aftonbladet&quot;, &quot;The Third Aftonbladet&quot; and so on
<br>
were started and banned. In the end it proved too much bad publicity and
<br>
trouble to ban the paper all the time, so it was left to continue. A
<br>
beautiful victory for free speech. 
<br>
<p>I think the times when this kind of game works is when there is no
<br>
strong support of a law, and there is a popular pressure to revoke it. 
<br>
So it might work well against some laws in some places, but it is not a
<br>
general approach. One has to understand both the public, politics and
<br>
the law.
<br>
<p>I think the combination of legal expertise and (say) programming skill
<br>
can produce some marvellous hacks to promote freedom, but just as it is
<br>
not possible to whip up a reliable and secure software system as an
<br>
amateur, it is not possible to whip up reliable and secure legal
<br>
loopholes as an amateur.
