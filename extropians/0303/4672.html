<p>What a coincidence.  All the anti-war stuff on I hear appears to 
<br>
come from hippie leftist peaceniks.  ;-)

<p>Seriously, I'll bet the Nolan chart pretty well predicts your
<br>
stance.  If you haven't, please try the World's Smallest Political

<p>(sorry if the questions are mostly for Americans).  For example,
<br>
suppose that you score exactly at the top of the chart, namely,
<br>
you are libertarian on both social and economic issues.  Then
<br>
I predict that there is a fifty percent probability that you'll
<br>
be for the war.  If you score a little to the left, the probability
<br>
lessens that you are for the war.
<br>
<p>My explanation of this phenomenon (if true, of course), is that
<br>
most people came to libertarianism from somewhere, and issues
<br>
that more directly involve our feelings are liable to expose
<br>
this origin.
