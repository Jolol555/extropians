<br>
this point, Ron. The term you're referring to is &quot;Practical liberalism&quot;, 
<br>
something the President in effect borrowed from former British Prime Minister 
<br>
Benjamin Disraeli. But let me also temper that by saying much of President 
<br>
Nixon's &quot;liberalism&quot; was forced upon him by what was arguably the most 
<br>
&quot;liberal&quot; Congress in our nation's history during that era. However, Nixon 
<br>
himself said he was &quot;liberal on health issues&quot;, but I would offer that had we 
<br>
had two brothers die of horrifying illness in our youths we might have 
<br>
reached similar positions.
<br>
<p>Max, if my fading memory serves me he made that comment (to which I refer) in 
<br>
drumming up support for his first run for Congress right after coming out of 
<br>
the Navy at the end of the Second World War.  Apparently he used that phrase 
<br>
or similar ones to describe himself over a long period of time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you ever get the chance and want to see Nixon at his best -- he 
<br>
gave a speech outlining his China policy before the Council on Foreign 
<br>
Affairs (have I got that title correctly) way before he went to China, in 
<br>
fact I believe it was slightly before the 68 election.  Nixon in speaking 
<br>
before what he recognized as a knowledgeable audience was brilliant.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to then see him at his worse watch him speaking to the 
<br>
electorate.  He seemed to want to simplify for his audience but lacked the 
<br>
talent to speak in that mode.
<br>
Ron h.
