<p><em>  &gt;I don't understand John. Do you doubt that the UN Charter exists
</em><br>
<p>No of course not.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;Or are you saying, as I think you are, that it does
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;exist but that it is not international law?
</em><br>
<p>Bingo.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;Lets also say that other people were widely referring to the
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;mutual obligations that the respective signatories had accepted by
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;signing on behalf of their countries by the phrase &quot;international law&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;Would you still hold that international law did not exist.
</em><br>
<p>Well, words can sound the same but have unrelated meanings, like see and sea
<br>
or to and two, so if you insist on using the same word at least spell in
<br>
differently to avoid confusion, I humbly suggest &quot;international blaw&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;Even if say President Bush and a whole bunch of other US authorities said
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;that it did?
</em><br>
<p>If President Bush said the laws of motion no longer exist that wouldn't make
<br>
it so, if President Bush says international laws exist that wouldn't make it
<br>
so. Anything that says &quot;you must do what I say or absolutely nothing will
<br>
happen to you&quot; is not a law, it is a suggestion.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;I haven't checked yet but I reckon Google could probably find us
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;some pretty good evidence that both (a) &quot;international law&quot; has
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;meaning as a phrase [...] But would that be enough evidence to satisfy
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;you that international law did exist and that you were mistaken to think
</em><br>
<em>  &gt;it did not?
</em><br>
<p>When I was in the third grade somebody brought a rabbit to class for show
<br>
and tell, a kid asked if it was a boy rabbit or a girl rabbit, nobody knew.
<br>
The teacher thought she knew how to find out, the class would vote on it.
<br>
Even at the time I wasn't sure that was the best way to determine the truth.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Is your current opinion in any way a falsifiable hypothesis to you?
</em><br>
<p>Show me a history of bad things that have happened to powerful countries
<br>
that broke international law and I am wrong.
