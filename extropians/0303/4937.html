</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You comment \&quot;so much\&quot; is a non-sequitor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, it is spelled 'non-sequitur', but that is another issue.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Doug is entirely right to say what he does, sequitur or non-sequitur.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turkey has invaded Iraq three times in the last decade.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't checked. I didn't see it as relevant. But I am willing to accept
<br>
that Doug and you are both right on this point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; with no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protest in the Security Council, no hand waving and squawking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by the French, the Germans, or the Russians.
</em><br>
<p>The Security Council doesn't do hand waving and squawking but
<br>
it is a fun image.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Turkey never sought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a resolution in the UN to support its actions, either, so if our action
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a violation of international law, then Turkey is three times worse,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet I see no condemnation from the likes of you.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Then&quot;, is the word that marks the non-sequitur, (thanks), in this
<br>
sentence.
<br>
<p>Your mistake arises, I suspect, from not understanding the structure
<br>
and/or purpose of the Security Council and how it makes resolutions.
<br>
<p>Turkey, unlike the US, and the UK are not permanent security council
<br>
members. Indeed it is not even a non-permanent security council
<br>
member (I don't know if Turkey was at the time of any of the earlier
<br>
incursions that you are referring too - that would be interesting).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it that it so plainly exposes the sophistry of your arguments as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; failed bleatings of a newsgroup lawyer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The security council can only make resolutions when none of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; five permanent members exercises their veto. And the Security
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Council doesn't always get  involved.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why the heck not, Bret???
</em><br>
<p>Now that is a good question and there are a number of reasons
<br>
I think. But perhaps the most important is because the Security
<br>
Council has five permanent security council members on it.
<br>
The US, the UK, &quot;Russia&quot;, China, and France.
<br>
<p>It is no coincidence that these 5 were the victorious powers in
<br>
World War II. The Security Council was intended to bring
<br>
the power to enforce its resolutions (when it made them) with it.
<br>
<p>These five are few enough to make decisions and strong enough
<br>
to kick serious butt if they are in agreement. But in world affairs
<br>
they are hardly (any one of them) disinterested observers.
<br>
<p>Hence all too often when problems have needed to be solved the
<br>
big 5 have not been able to reach agreement without one or more
<br>
of them &quot;vetoing&quot; a resolution.  The big 5 are often exactly the
<br>
ones who tend to throw their weight around in the world and any
<br>
one of them can &quot;veto&quot; the forming of a security council resolution
<br>
that they see as against their interests or the interests of their friends
<br>
and allies (such as, perhaps, in the case of the US, Israel).
<br>
<p>The strength of the UN, the big 5, is also its weakness.
<br>
<p>But never before has the security council actually gotten such 
<br>
substantial agreement on such an important issues. All 15 security
<br>
council members agreed to 1441 remember. 
<br>
<p>Never before, has a resolution once made, (and once made these
<br>
are the highest form of international law that there is), been stepped
<br>
away from by permanent security council resolution members.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is, according to you and your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cronies, EXACTLY what the Security Council is supposed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevent, according to your voluminous quotations of the UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Charter.
</em><br>
<p>Not according to me. I did not sign the Charter. And I am aware
<br>
of no cronies ;-).
<br>
<p>What the UN Charter and the Security Council is supposed to
<br>
prevent is according to the signatures of those that signed it
<br>
(and have not at this stage revoked the agreement).
<br>
<p>The rest of your post seems to be of less relevance after this
<br>
point Mike.
<br>
<p>But just so you don't think I am playing games with you. It is
<br>
not my position that President Bush could not under any
<br>
circumstances act outside the UN. It is my position that any
<br>
permanent security council member (and perhaps any member)
<br>
can revoke the UN Charter and withdraw from it thereby
<br>
absolving themselves of any obligations under it if they think it
<br>
has so seriously failed in its purpose.
<br>
<p>But President Bush did not revoke the Charter like this. That
<br>
is my concern (or one of them). President Bush seems to think
<br>
that under his administration the US can treat its word of honor
<br>
given to other nations as optional. And that must have consequences.
<br>
