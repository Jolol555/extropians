<em>&gt; (Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20Take%20your%20Whuffie%20and%20shove%20it,%20WAS:%20So%20who's%20counting?">mlorrey@yahoo.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Seems to me you're describing good old free market capitalism: people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; earn money only to the extent that they do things or produce things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others want to pay for voluntarily.  Why should people be rewarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; acting according to their &quot;true nature&quot;, if, for example, they are by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nature predators and not honest traders?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, no. A predator will find a niche as a hunter. Free market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism strikes a balance between individual desires and communal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demands. I can make 1000 gizwhats a day if that makes my life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fulfilled, but if everyone else only wants 100 a day, I'm gonna have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either find something else to do with the rest of my time or else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; figure out a way to generate all the income I need to live from just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 100 a day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The karma market previously described takes absolutely no consideration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the desires of the producer and only acts as a signal of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desires of the consumer. It is therefore an initiation of force against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those which produce that which the karma assignors are evaluating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Free market capitalism is a negotiation of the desires of both. A truly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free market karma system would balance a rating by the author of a post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of how fulfilling it was to write the post, to how fulfilled the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readers were upon reading the post.
</em><br>
<p>Nope, you're missing the point entirely.  The free market /allows/
<br>
you to do whatever the hell you please, but it still only /rewards/
<br>
you for what others are willing to pay for, without exception.  The
<br>
only difference is the medium of exchange: green paper notes with
<br>
vague promises or database records of approvals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, if a writer achieves total fulfillment writing a post, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everybody in the reading pool achieved zero fulfillment reading it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is net zero karma, just as a writer who only wrote things which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gave total fulfillment to everyone else but none to themselves would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve zero karma. You get positive karma when both sides gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fulfillment, and negative karma when both sides lose fulfillment.
</em><br>
<p>No, you gain karma /only/ when consumers are satisfied, just as in
<br>
the free market where one can quite easily grow rich doing something
<br>
you personally don't like.  I know this well--I played poker for a
<br>
living for a while, and it was extremely fulfilling; and I was poor.
<br>
Now I write software that prints your cable bill, and they throw
<br>
money at me.  It's still my choice which road to pursue, but it's
<br>
not my choice which one gets paid more--that's the consumer's choice.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How you equate the value of fulfillment of the one writer to that of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the many readers is a value judgement that is entirely subjective to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your prejudices.
</em><br>
<p>The value of the fulfillment of the writer is /his/ choice to make.
<br>
The value of the /money/ he gets from the writing is the choice of
<br>
the consumers.  The writer must judge for himself how he values his
<br>
own satisfaction and therefore choose his course of action, but he is
<br>
choosing from inputs that are not under his control.  It makes not one
<br>
whit of difference what the particular currency is, the market works
<br>
the same way: personal satisfaction may come from doing your own
<br>
thing, but wealth always has and always will come from doing what the
<br>
market wants.
