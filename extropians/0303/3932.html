<p><em>&gt; Hal: However, the notion of many-worlds at Tegmark's level 1 and 2 suggests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we do have to consider identical universes to add to the measure and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of the experiences they contain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Spudboy: &gt; The answer is to give the cosmos, our cosmos, a purpose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Call it a living, evolving, purpose; because such interactions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if such are possible, would create their own synergy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee: &gt; Isn't it just to increment that which makes lives worth living?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Namely, joy, fulfillment, satisfaction, rapture, contentment, technolust...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; [Scerir:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can we say that the 'universal' or 'global' (does it make sense?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information increases?
</em><br>
<p>I think that this can be said, and is true, whether we discuss the
<br>
physics of it or the more important aspects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can we say, at least, that the quality (subjective concept?) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information increases?
</em><br>
<p>Our default supposition IMO should be that the quality is objective.
<br>
We are naturally evolved creatures, and taking as often as we can 
<br>
the &quot;bird's eye view&quot;, the human beings' values of quality have a
<br>
number of characteristics that are increasing:  the quality of their
<br>
information firstly relates to how much they know about their
<br>
universe.  A completely objective analysis would reveal that the
<br>
average human nervous system now possess far more accurate maps of
<br>
its surroundings and its place in space than ever before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I remember well, Tegmark used to say, in one of his first TOE papers,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the global information is zero, or something like that. But,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe, with MWI, inflations, and simulations, and all that, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; global information increases.
</em><br>
<p>The ideas that I had always understood were that the &quot;sum total of energy&quot;
<br>
of the universe being zero, and the &quot;sum total of information&quot; in the
<br>
universe was zero.  In other words, information was never lost, except
<br>
in the possibly troubling case of black holes.
<br>
<p>Then, later, when one relinquishes the idea of wave collapse, one
<br>
allows that the Schroedering equation is time reversible.  So, I
<br>
had also gathered that from the point of view of QM or MWI, there
<br>
was no information increase in the universe.  But perhaps the 
<br>
Level Two Linde proliferation of new bubbles changes that?   Well,
<br>
one argument that it doesn't is that you always have exactly 
<br>
aleph-null bubbles, period.
<br>
<p>I have to leave alone your other interesting points for now.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok, there is a classic problem here. That one saying that all information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the output of a given 'program' cannot be greater than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information within the program itself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And there is another conceptual problem. Sometimes (i.e. q.entanglements,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; q.measurements, etc.) it is difficult to say if the information resides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the relations between the objects, or in the objects (which could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from what we thought).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I remember that Von Weizsaecker (since 1955) pointed out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible existence of 'abstract' and maybe 'potential' primordial entities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; named 'Urs'. There also was a striking coincidence with 'big' or 'magic'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers of the (known) universe (without MWI, inflations, etc.).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9611048">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9611048</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Recently it turned out that those 'Urs' are. more or less,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the qubits! But, at that time, people thought Von Weizsaecker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has got some illness. <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212084">http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0212084</a>
