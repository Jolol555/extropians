<p>Lee, the result was foreseen, the action was
<br>
intentional.  Those who minister to those in need
<br>
perpetuate their existence by keeping people in need.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the pressing question is still, what *can* be

</em><br>
<p>The answer is harsh, but no more so than the actions
<br>
that have already been taken in the name of charity.
<br>
The technically advanced must have the courage to
<br>
declare that all cultures are not truly equal, that
<br>
some cultures really are better than others, and that
<br>
technology really does make for longer, healthier,
<br>
happier, better lives.
<br>
<p>Nonviolent memetic warfare is called for.  Are we
<br>
morally obligated to respect other's lives and safety?
<br>
Of course.  Are we morally obligated to respect other's
<br>
cultures, religions and customs?  I argue that we are
<br>
not, that ideas want to be free.  Ideas will make their
<br>
way into closed cultures, and those cultures will
<br>
be turned upside down.  We cannot stop that, we do not
<br>
want to stop that.  The old ways will be overturned.
<br>
No one can lock up any sizable piece of real estate
<br>
on this planet for any one religion or custom.  No
<br>
one can stop a radio wave.  No one can stop capitalism.
