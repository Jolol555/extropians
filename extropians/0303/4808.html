<em>&gt; Without prejudice, any individual is allowed order an airstrike on any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set of coordinates (except the airfield itself, duh!). The cost of an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airstrike reflects the actual expenses incurred in launching it plus whatever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; profit margin the market will bear. Since it's likely that even a light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airstrike will be far beyond the budget of any but the richest citizens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the company will maintain an &quot;Airstrike Fund&quot; for every possible set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coordinates in the service area. Once the fund for a given set of coordinates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surpasses the price for a particular type of airstrike, that airstrike is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; launched. There are separate funds for different categories of airstrike,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a fund that will automatically empty out into the airstrike fund that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; closest to its set-point. There is also an anti-airstrike fund which is used
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to raise the bar on the airstrike funds that it specifies. Finally, there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MAD-insurance. It's an arrangement that if coordinates of your choosing are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjected to an airstrike, an amount of money you pre-specify is automatically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transferred into the airstrike fund or funds of your choosing. This means that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; areas with an economic value will be better defended than areas whose value is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purely tactical... fortresses don't pay for themselves; factories do.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; The most violent players in the region spend the most money, and make the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most enemies, and effectively make it impossible for themselves to rely on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any large, permanent structures. True, perpetrators of violence can choose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not to do business with the most effective violence-management agent in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; region, but then there's the fear that their competitors will do business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and have that advantage. The common people still have means of defending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves, by chipping into airstrike funds and/or anti-airstrike funds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and/or MAD-insurance. Furthermore, loss of human life will decrease, since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the status of airstrike funds for all coordinates will be public knowledge,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and freely available in a convenient graphical form at all locations where
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airstrike fund deposits are accepted.
</em><br>
<p>Hm.  I foresee the richest individual(s) in the region making threats of 
<br>
airstrikes against all parties too poor to launch a retaliatory airstrike. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the airstrike doesn't need to be carried out, except perhaps for 
<br>
one or two examples, this should provide a steady revenue stream for the 
<br>
individuals rich enough to afford airstrikes, but the airstrike company 
<br>
itself will eventually go bankrupt, perhaps being bought out by the 
<br>
violence monopolists.  Similarly, the rich individual could launch a 
<br>
preemptive strike at any poor individuals who showed signs of clubbing up 
<br>
to buy a strike at the rich individual.
<br>
<p>Looks just like our same old world to me.
