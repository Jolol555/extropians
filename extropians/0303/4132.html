<p><em>&gt; I haven't followed the Palladium debate too closely myself. Do you think

</em><br>
<em>&gt; worked up about it?
</em><br>
<p>Basically there are two classes of arguments against Palladium that I
<br>
have seen.  The first is that it might be made mandatory, and the second
<br>
is that it might become very common even if not mandated and reduce the
<br>
flexibility of computing systems.
<br>
<p>I approach the technology from a libertarian perspective, and my default
<br>
presumption is that any voluntary technology is perfectly fine.  And I
<br>
define voluntary rather broadly, to include systems which are de facto
<br>
monopolies simply because everyone prefers to use them.  I think that most
<br>
of the so-called horrible crimes that Microsoft is accused of are actually
<br>
completely reasonable and appropriate behaviors in a free market system.
<br>
As far as I know Microsoft has not sent any thugs around to beat people
<br>
up or to coerce them at gunpoint.  I don't even think they have been
<br>
particularly aggressive in leveraging government's coercive power,
<br>
at least compared to many businesses.
<br>
<p>It seems that my feelings on these matters are 180 degrees out of phase
<br>
with most people's in the online community.  Microsoft is seen as evil and
<br>
any technology which could increase their control over computing systems
<br>
is evil as well.  I say that Microsoft is one of the best companies
<br>
in the world and any technology which they offer has to compete in the
<br>
marketplace with everyone else's.  In the end I am looking at it from a
<br>
perspective where the question is almost moot: of course Palladium is
<br>
good, because every technology that has to compete in the marketplace
<br>
is good.  This is not a widely shared view.
<br>
<p>As for the fears about government mandating of these technologies,
<br>
I agree that this would be very bad, and to the extent that Palladium
<br>
might invite such mandates I would agree with this criticism.  However I
<br>
don't particularly see that this technology as one which is likely to be
<br>
made mandatory.  If it succeeds in the market, then requiring it would
<br>
be redundant.  And if it does not succeed, then forcing all systems to
<br>
be retrofitted with Palladium technology would be so expensive that the
<br>
opposition would be immense (not even considering the political outcry).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Speaking of alternative approaches to handling intellectual property, 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's very interesting, I will try to respond in another message.
