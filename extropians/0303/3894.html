<p>ST0003.DTL&amp;type=science
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;(03-05) 00:20 PST TUSTIN, Calif. (AP) -- 
<br>
<p>A plan by a Texas company to send a spacecraft sailing to the stars on the 
<br>
gentle push of the sun's rays has caught the interest of the National Oceanic 
<br>
and Atmospheric Administration, which is exploring the technology for use 
<br>
closer to home. 
<br>
<p>Team Encounter wants to test a spacecraft with a solar sail by late 2004, 
<br>
sending it into Earth orbit with messages and photographs tucked aboard by 
<br>
paying customers. 
<br>
<p>Once in space, the craft would unfurl an enormous, gossamer sail to catch the 
<br>
sun's rays, harnessing the gentle -- but constant and cumulative -- pressure 
<br>
of particles of light to propel it through space. 
<br>
<p>The sail would be made of Mylar, coated with aluminum and chromium. It would 
<br>
be 76 times thinner than a human hair and cover a football field-size area -- 
<br>
but able to fit in a package the size of a bread box. 
<br>
<p>&quot;From everything we've seen so far, it's possible. There are no show 
<br>
stoppers,&quot; said Costas Cassapakis, president of L'Garde Inc., the Tustin 
<br>
company developing the 62,000-square-foot sail and the 164-foot inflatable 
<br>
booms that would deploy it. 
<br>
<p>If the orbital mission succeeds, a second spacecraft would be sent out to the 
<br>
stars with a payload of messages and DNA samples. 
<br>
<p>While NOAA wants no part of that mission, the technology intrigues it. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The mission was far out, but the way they were getting at it wasn't,&quot; said 
<br>
Patricia Mulligan, a NOAA mission planner. 
<br>
<p>NOAA has paid a small amount to examine Team Encounter's engineering data. It 
<br>
also wants the Houston-based company to point its craft toward a part of 
<br>
space the agency wants to exploit for future satellite missions, Mulligan 
<br>
said. 
<br>
<p>Solar sails could enable satellites to loiter in space at spots called 
<br>
Lagrange points, where the gravitational pulls of the Earth and the sun 
<br>
cancel each other. 
<br>
<p>A Lagrange-based craft has a stable vantage point above Earth that 
<br>
traditional orbiting satellites lack. But it also requires constant 
<br>
adjustment. That can be fuel-intensive for chemically powered spacecraft but 
<br>
a solar sail doesn't have that problem. 
<br>
<p>&quot;It relies on the virtually inexhaustible supply of energy from the sun,&quot; 
<br>
said Charles Chafer, Team Encounter's president and chief executive officer. 
<br>
<p>NOAA has preliminary plans for two types of solar sail craft that would park 
<br>
in Lagrange orbits. One, called Geostorm, would sit part way to the sun and 
<br>
provide early warning of solar storms before they reach Earth. The storms -- 
<br>
waves of charged particles from solar flares -- can disrupt communications 
<br>
networks and power grids. 
<br>
<p>Another craft, called a polesitter, would linger either above or below the 
<br>
ecliptic, the plane in which the planets orbit the sun. That would enable it 
<br>
to stare down on either of the Earth's poles. 
<br>
<p>Those spacecraft could provide a dedicated communication link for scientists 
<br>
in the Antarctic, who now must contend with spotty connections to polar 
<br>
orbiting satellites that pass overhead once every 90 minutes, Mulligan said. 
<br>
<p>Team Encounter is considering NOAA's request to fly a solar sail spacecraft 
<br>
into a polesitting orbit. NOAA has provided $50,000 to explore if such a 
<br>
mission would be feasible, Mulligan said. 
<br>
<p>It isn't the only private developer of a solar sail mission, an idea that's 
<br>
been knocked around for decades. The Planetary Society, a Pasadena-based 
<br>
space exploration advocacy group, also is working on such a spacecraft. 
<br>
<p>The group hopes to launch an eight-petaled solar sail into orbit as early as 
<br>
August, Executive Director Louis Friedman said. 
<br>
<p>Project members, who include Ann Druyan, the widow of astronomer Carl Sagan, 
<br>
hope the craft will move out from the Earth and become the first to be 
<br>
propelled by sunlight. 
<br>
<p>&quot;If it spirals outward a few centimeters and we can measure it, then we can 
<br>
declare victory,&quot; Friedman said.
