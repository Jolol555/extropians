<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Apparently, Mr. Mania, you have no sense of irony. The respondent was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using acts that Saddam has committed, and which you and your country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem blithely unwilling to bring him to task on. The fact that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so willing to remove Mr. Bush for acts which Mr. Saddam has committed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not willing to remove Mr. Saddam, exposes your hypocrisy and hidden
</em><br>
agenda....
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes, you are right, I failed to see the irony here. But anyway, your fine
<br>
President will be responsible for the deaths of American soldiers and for
<br>
invading a country. So, the reasons for accusation remain just the same,
<br>
no matter if I failed to detect ironic statements or not.&quot;
<br>
<p>So you now recognize the irony, but do nothing to answer the question?  Why
<br>
would you support a move, unilitarerally or multilaterally, to depose Bush
<br>
as a war criminal but CALL Bush a war criminal for trying to do exactly that
<br>
with Saddam, who IS in fact a war criminal.  Do you not recognize your own
<br>
hypocricy?
<br>
<p>&quot;I also want Saddam to be removed but not on the cost of a mountain of
<br>
civilian Iraqui corpses, which will be a war crime.&quot;
<br>
<p>So you want Saddam removed, but at the cost of not a single Iraqi Civilian?
<br>
I would ask then, how many corpses has Saddam himself racked up?
<br>
Conservatives estimates, as others on list have mentioned, are around
<br>
200,000.  How many need he rack up before losing one Iraqi civilian (Perhaps
<br>
one he has tied to his front door) to remove him becomes just?  Your policy
<br>
of absolutely no civilian casualities if implemented in *any* past war would
<br>
have lead to the immediate and catrastrophic rise to power of any and all
<br>
totalatrian regimes, we would today be the peoples planet of the soviet
<br>
union.  If you considered Bush a war criminal, would killing one civilian be
<br>
just in ousting his tryannical regime, what if he has all-ready killed
<br>
100,000s of thousands, and there is no reason to suspect he will stop?
<br>
<p>In short, you seem ready to jump on the 'remove the murderous bastard'
<br>
bandwagon only if it is Bush who is the 'murderous bastard'.  Please outline
<br>
also a course of action that you would consider just in removing murderous
<br>
tyrants from power.
<br>
<p>&quot;I never would have thought that I would ever have to defend a pacifist
<br>
attitude here on the list when I started reading extropian mails in 1996.&quot;
<br>
<p>I never thought it would be overun with moral relativist apologist hippies
<br>
who don't care for the lives of anyone but the individuals in thier own
<br>
countries.  Take a look at the number of human kills racked up by murderous
<br>
tyrannical regimes.  R.J. Rummels excellent site &quot;Power Kills&quot; estimates
<br>
that in the 20th century alone these governments have killed 170 million
<br>
people.  <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/20TH.HTM</a>  I have heard of no
<br>
german forces fighting the murderous North Vietnames attemptes to slaughter
<br>
and enslave the entire population of Indochina.
<br>
<p>&quot;I am amazed how many rednecks are assembled here.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am amazed at your lack of understanding of these geopolitical issues.
<br>
Your absolute pacifism is irrational and illogical, and would lead to a
<br>
system that actually rewards murderous expansionist regimes.  Try plugging
<br>
'always cooperate' into any game strategy program and see how long it lasts.
<br>
Cooperate with a force invading your country?  Coopoerate with a force
<br>
invading another country you are allied with?  Cooperate with a murderous
<br>
government killing its own people?  Where does this cooperation lead?
<br>
<p>&quot;but I do support their stance against the Iraq war which is a disarmament
<br>
founded on peaceful methods and more patience.&quot;
<br>
<p>You seem oblivious or ignorant of the fact that the inspectors would not
<br>
even *be* in Iraq were it not for the credible threat of force from the US.
<br>
Note 'Credible' in that statement.  This is why the inspectors were absent
<br>
for the past 12 years.  What if Saddam, as a murderous tyrant, is not
<br>
interested in 'disarmament founded on a peaceful method'?  What would you
<br>
propose be done then, just wait and hope he changes his mind, while he
<br>
contiues to kill thousands of people?
<br>
<p>Why so ready to depose Bush for the same crimes that Saddam routinely
<br>
commits?
<br>
<p>And for the record, I am proudly quite pale.
<br>
