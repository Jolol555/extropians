</em><br>
<p>Ja, and part of the problem was that the culture
<br>
clash was exaggerated greatly by the medical students
<br>
being preselected from the type-A super achiever
<br>
types.  One can imagine the get-it-done-NOW types
<br>
trying to work with those who had lived the same
<br>
way since prehistoric times.
<br>
<p>The villages where they were trying to set up shop
<br>
were in the waaay outback.  It seems logical to
<br>
imagine those villages suffer multi-generational
<br>
brain drain in Africa the same as we discussed
<br>
happening in rural America: those with talent,
<br>
ability and get-up-and-go, do exactly that.  They
<br>
learn English or French, then leave for the city,
<br>
never to return.  One can scarcely blame them.
<br>
<p>One of the lessons learned by my missionary friends
<br>
was that going into the remote villages was simply
<br>
too ambitious.  The medical students would do better
<br>
by setting up shop in the middle of the most modern
<br>
African city, train the locals in medical technology
<br>
and send them out instead.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Sometimes they'd have to sit you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down in a chair and practically brow beat it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The most frightful part is that they would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely right...
</em><br>
<p>Well, partially right.  The missionaries had imported a
<br>
bunch of building materials for the clinic since
<br>
that cannot be practically built from the available
<br>
indigenous materials: western doctors cannot perform
<br>
surgery unless they have cleanroom conditions,
<br>
otherwise the risk of infection is too great.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, the Africans generally had no
<br>
immunity to antibiotics, so they were highly
<br>
effective.  Perhaps they could do some limited
<br>
surgery in less-than-optimal sanitary conditions,
<br>
I suggested, along with liberal use of antibiotics,
<br>
thus obviating the need for all the expensive block
<br>
and other materials.
<br>
<p>In response, the father of my girlfriend made an
<br>
interesting comment.  He said that the sturdy
<br>
building materials were mostly to protect the medical
<br>
supplies from theft.
<br>
<p>My notion: instead of building a clinic in place,
<br>
to build a railroad and set up a box car as a
<br>
rolling clinic, this kind of structure being
<br>
inherently secure.
