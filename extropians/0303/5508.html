<p><em>&gt; Will people all across the world start to feel powerless?  Already I question 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the amount of impact one person can really make in the world.
</em><br>
<p>How much power do you think a citizen of China felt in 200 B.C.,
<br>
in a nation of 40 million ruled by an Emperor?  Or a citizen of
<br>
Rome at about the same time?   People have had literally thousands
<br>
of years to adjust to the idea of being a very small cog in a very
<br>
big machine.  Still, it grates on our intuitions, which were
<br>
developed during the hunter-gatherer stage when we lived in very
<br>
small groups.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I often wonder if these great technologies such as AI and nanotech
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will make a &quot;power elite&quot; in the world.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, this is *exactly* what people have been worrying about, in
<br>
one form or another, since 1986 when Eric Drexler published
<br>
&quot;Engines of Creation&quot;.
<br>
<p>But Anders writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real issue is whether any new technologies would empower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elites to a greater extent than ordinary people.
</em><br>
<p>In my opinion, elites are *already* vastly empowered compared
<br>
to ordinary people, and have been since Sargon the Great 
<br>
created the first empire 4500 years ago.
<br>
<p>Anders also says
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Information technology does not seem to have that effect.
</em><br>
<p>And here, he is still talking about the same thing that you
<br>
are.  My emphasis is different.  When I think about &quot;shifts
<br>
of power due to increased technology&quot;, runaway AI comes 
<br>
right to mind.  Now, if runaway nanotech or AI takes over,
<br>
then you'll *really* have a reason to feel powerless, if
<br>
you even have an ability to *feel* at all, and aren't quite
<br>
dead.  After all, just what reason should some vastly superior
<br>
AI have for keeping people around?
<br>
<p>These issues compel many to believe that our only chance is
<br>
through exerting every fiber of our being in the project of
<br>
making a beneficent AI who'll protect us from these possible
<br>
developments.  You might very well wish to check out Eliezer
<br>
Yudkovsky's writings on our prospects for making a &quot;Friendly AI&quot;.
<br>
In a sense, this is the most pro-active position I know of for
<br>
heading off our utter demise.  Please see <a href="http://singinst.org/">http://singinst.org/</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did previous technologies create a power elite group?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Chariots introduced in about 1800 B.C. made the bronze
<br>
weapons held by the common soldier almost useless.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contemporaneous accounts convey some sense of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sheer terror a massed body of unprotected infantry standing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in a flat desert felt when they confronted hundreds of war
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chariots bearing down on them at high speed...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Within a few decades, the nomads [who possess the new
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;terror weapons] destroyed every military force in the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;region.... they also sought to build elite units of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;charioteers...
<br>
<p>from Science goes to War, p. 17.  This book gives many other examples,
<br>
such as the invention of the crossbow.  A good crossbowman requited
<br>
years and years of training and practice, and came to be an invincible
<br>
military elite.  Invincible, that is, until in 1450 the French mowed
<br>
the bowmen down by the dozens with a brand new terror weapon, the
<br>
cannon.  And on and on and on, right up to 1945.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wonder how long the majority of people can be plugged into the matrix.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think the majority will be content with virtual reality?
</em><br>
<p>I think that the average person will be DAMN LUCKY to get something
<br>
so good as virtual reality.  I have loudly proclaimed my eagerness
<br>
to be run by any AI that will give me worthwhile experience, and I
<br>
couldn't care less how &quot;artificial&quot; it is.  The vastly, vastly bigger
<br>
worry is that you might not be at all.
<br>
<p>I know, if you're under 30, then the prospect of non-existence seems
<br>
like a piddling unconcern.  Perhaps we evolved that way so that we
<br>
would instantly lose interest as soon as someone brought up the 
<br>
&quot;boring&quot; subject that we will someday die.  But for *anyone* reading
<br>
this, logically this should be your number one concern!  The way
<br>
things are going, you survived the 20th century, but you will NOT
<br>
survive the 21st century.  You will be dead.
<br>
<p>Ho, hum.  I can hear the yawns already.  
<br>
<p>I give up.  Most people are deathoids, born and bred.
<br>
