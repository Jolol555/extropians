<p>I would not characterise Nixon as a loon.  Certainly Caligula was much 
<br>
more insane.  He did, however, betray his oath of office repeatedly.  He 
<br>
did suborn justice.  He did attempt to destroy the evidence.  I believe 
<br>
that he did many more cimes, but those are matters of public record.  So 
<br>
he may not have been a literal loon.  Perhaps.  And he may have done 
<br>
some good things.  (OK.  It's quite likely that he wasn't intending to 
<br>
destroy the government, and he probably saw himself as the good guy, and 
<br>
did what he thought a good guy would do.)
<br>
But he clearly deserved to be not only impeached, but convicted and 
<br>
sentenced to hard labor.  At minimum.  My personal feeling was that he 
<br>
should have been &quot;crucified in a public square&quot; for betrayal of his 
<br>
country.  But he wasn't as bad as Bush, not even nearly.  We just had 
<br>
higher standards then.
