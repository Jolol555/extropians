<p><em>&gt;&lt;&lt;I saw a TV report that one UK official claimed that if not for

</em><br>
<p>Well, what an amazing analogy. Of course, a much closer one might go
<br>
something like this:
<br>
<p>Three police officers have a rapist cornered in a dark alley. One cop,
<br>
having seen this perp before, suspects he may be armed and so immediately
<br>
draws his service revolver. A second cop, not knowing the perp, nonetheless
<br>
notes a suspicious bulge under the man's jacket and likewise draws his
<br>
service revolver. All three yell in unison: &quot;PUT YOUR HANDS IN THE AIR&quot; But
<br>
then the third cop decides to start an argument about the seriousness of the
<br>
threat. He wonders whether if they might not have the wrong guy. He wonders
<br>
if the perp might have forgotten to load it his weapon that morning, or if
<br>
whether they even have a right to be enforcing the laws in this manner.
<br>
<p>The rapist, sensing his opportunity, quickly draws his weapon and empties it
<br>
in the direction of the bickering trio.
<br>
<p>Fortunately the two armed officers are not hit, but a bullet does strike the
<br>
fr... I mean, the third cop right between the eyes.
