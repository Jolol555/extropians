Another way you might explore to get vivid, recallable dreams, if that is
<br>
what you are really interested in, is to meditate to the point of
<br>
tranquility and empty your mind before you go to sleep. In a way, this is
<br>
the exact opposite of some techniques of lucid dreaming, because you make
<br>
sure you do not have a &quot;seed&quot; of conscious intent before you begin
<br>
dreaming. This is what works for me, and I think it opens the mind up much
<br>
more to unconscious, subconscious, areas of the mind that the conscious
<br>
mind is not aware of. Consciousness is like the tip of the iceberg of our
<br>
minds, and bringing it in to dream states might actually limit what we
<br>
can get to know about the rest of our mind (upon waking, and remembering
<br>
a free-form dream). Plus, there is a risk in seeding one's unconscious
<br>
with conscious directives, if those conscious directives are not very well
<br>
chosen. Like you say, a terrorist could use them to practice
<br>
horrific destructive and self-destructive acts. On a more banal note, a
<br>
lot of &quot;self-improvement&quot; folks hector their unconscious minds with
<br>
slogans of &quot;empowerment&quot; (these function like mantras) - so that even an
<br>
illogical and pointless notion can get &quot;programmed&quot; into the personality
<br>
(&quot;I can do anything,&quot; &quot;I deserve to pamper myself,&quot; &quot;I am a vibrant,
<br>
confident individual whom everyone likes,&quot; etc.).

<em>&gt; Harvey, thanks for your lengthy and encouraging reply. I had hoped for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something along those lines, but wasn't necessarily expecting it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow! So you've had (more or less) controlled access to this &quot;alternate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality&quot; since you were four years old huh? What is the frequency of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lucid dreams now then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've had maybe four or five in my entire life in which, for whatever reason,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realized that I was dreaming and so I could proceed to explore or assert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my wishes with abandon. It has been many years since the last time, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still recall that it was a highly empowering, emotionally satisfying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I remember reading somewhere that Osama Bin Laden and his cronies placed an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unusually high value on the interpretation of dreams and I think at the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said something to myself along the lines of: Wow, how incredibly stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I had assumed that his interest was centered on the metaphysical, signs from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Allah angle, but now I wonder if something else wasn't going on there as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, say if in a series of lucid dreams - and this gets back to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you said about doing useful work while dreaming - one were to repeatedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice, in the absence of usual crippling fear, smashing a fuel laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airliner into a building. And every time, just as the fireball slaps you in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the face, you wake up safe and sound in your own bed. I'd guess that after a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few practice runs of this nature, you'd become fairly confident you had &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right stuff&quot; to get the job done in the real world. Essentially, you'd know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from past experience that you wouldn't be one to veer off at the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible moment and make a bee-line for tea and scrumpets with Saddam or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moammar Quadaffi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just something to think about I guess. I'm reasonably certain I'd make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lousy Kamikaze pilot. I don't buy lottery tickets, and my seventy-two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; virgins would probably be butt ugly and have names like Olga or Gert. They'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also, no doubt, be opposed to any genetic enhancements that didn't directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve their chances of winning a gold medal in the weightlifting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition.
