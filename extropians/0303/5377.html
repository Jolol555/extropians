<em>&gt; Man, I really hate that silly phrase and you are wrong. It is Extropian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call something what it actually is and the fact is that on this small 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; planet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there exist life forms that are callous elitist self-absorbed imbeciles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Right. Ad hominem is never correct in an ideal frictionless volume of 
<br>
discourse about logical propositions. Which almost no real world &quot;debates&quot;, 
<br>
or even scholastic forensics debates, really are. Rational arguments from 
<br>
the wrong presuppositions yield _what_ sort of conclusions? Picking those 
<br>
things apart methodically during a TV show measured in minutes does *what* 
<br>
to the audience?
<br>
<p>Telling a NAMBLA proponent *why* you don't want to accept his sponsorship 
<br>
of your Gay Pride float, or telling a WWP staffer where to stick his ANSWER 
<br>
coalition, is pointedly &quot;toward the man&quot; but IMO rather more justifiable 
<br>
than some yahoo Wyoming junior college student telling his Philosophy 101 
<br>
class he won't do his Boolean Algebra homework because the prof talks like 
<br>
some sort of fag.
<br>
<p>Expressing exasperation can mark more than exasperation; criticising the 
<br>
man can short circuit a great deal of pointless amphigory. Or they can draw 
<br>
battle lines and become just more smokescreen themselves. It all depends.
<br>
<p>The best I can do, PCRishly, is to check my intentions, desired results, 
<br>
and achieved results as objectively as possible as often as seems 
<br>
profitable, and pay attention to news that indicates I might need to update 
<br>
those parameters.
<br>
<p>MMB
