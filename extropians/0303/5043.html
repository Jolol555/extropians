<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; How strange.  Alex was interested in getting stills or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; video about the POW situation, and you've substituted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for that info about Iraqi civilian casualties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Oh well... at least I think I understand your motivation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the switch.
</em><br>
<p>and Damien replies
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HERE ARE TWO PLACES I'D EXPECT TO FIND SOME STILLS, BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; HAVE ANY EITHER 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do you find hard to understand?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My adding some extra information about what *is* there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ISN'T A *SWITCH*, 
</em><br>
<p>It is too.  And that you can't see it speaks volumes.  All I'll
<br>
say is that if the situation were reversed and someone posted
<br>
an inquiry for data concerning Iraqi civilian casualties, it
<br>
would be a cold day in hell before I'd direct them to a site
<br>
showing the poor American POWs.  
<br>
<p>There is a partisan component to most of these discussions.
<br>
It's always possible that the inquiry after pictures or
<br>
video of the American POWs was partly designed to elicit
<br>
some pro-American emotion, (though not necessarily, of course),
<br>
and there is no doubt that a minor effect of that among our
<br>
readers would be supportive of the Americans.  It absolutely
<br>
passeth understanding that you are not aware of this.
<br>
<p>Therefore, I can't help but entertain the idea that many of my
<br>
opposite political numbers feel they have special dispensation,
<br>
and while a switch from emphasizing the horrors inflicted on
<br>
Iraqi casualties to emphasizing the horrors visited on American
<br>
POWs would be viewed by them as calculatedly partisan, the exact
<br>
same thing from their side is viewed as nothing even notable.
<br>
