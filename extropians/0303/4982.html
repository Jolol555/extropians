<em>&gt; The entire notion that we even have /instincts/ predisposing

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Please support that contention.  I am not aware of any such &quot;dogma&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whether or not violent instincts can be controlled depends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greatly upon the individual and that individual's genetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; endowment.  Stupidity is also highly correlated with violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior.  Soon, I predict, people with especially violent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tendencies can be treated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  If broad control/channeling of agression was not 
<br>
widely possible and practical civilization would not have 
<br>
occurred.  Violence is one of many likely possibilities given 
<br>
our genetic makeup.  It is fortunately not the only or even the 
<br>
predominant one.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I completely agree that without genetic modification, too many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people will remain violent, and criminal behavior can only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealt with by the primitive methods now in place.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Do you mean too many people will remain capable of violence or 
<br>
too many people will chose to be violent?  I assume the latter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1. Many anti-war activists believe that this* is possible and that war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;should be avoided.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;2. Many war activists believe that this* is possible and that war is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;progressing globalization and thereby causing this to happen sooner.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;The other belief is that this is not possible. If this is not possible,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;given our technology at this time, than these instincts for power and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;violence will always be present in society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>There is no such thing as &quot;an instinct for violence&quot; per se. 
<br>
War should be avoided as much as possible and violence curtailed 
<br>
simply because as we become more technologically sophisticated 
<br>
the possibility for highly dystopic outcomes, up to and 
<br>
including the destruction of humanity and all higher 
<br>
intelligence on this planet, grows.  Levels of violence and ways 
<br>
violence is channeled that were acceptable at a lower level of 
<br>
technology become fraught with greater consequences.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me address the level of nations for a moment.  Nations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are *not* in recent centuries administrated by violent or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sociopathic individuals.  Each such leader, whether it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Putin, Blair, Bush, Stalin, Mao, Hitler, Marcos or Pinochet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a very sociable and effective team player.  These leaders
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take advantage of the territoriality and instincts of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens, to serve their citizens by lookout out for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national interest (or what they perceive to be the nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Stalin? Hitler?  Excuse me?  Some of these individuals were 
<br>
actively psychopathic and some of them practiced genocide.  Some 
<br>
of these individuals believed that killing off other humans was 
<br>
quite ok as long as it seemed to advance their own goals.  There 
<br>
is nothing good or &quot;being a team player&quot; about this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus each leader---from Hussein to Blair---acts at some level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to advance what he believes to be the national interest.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still true that in non-democratic countries, the egos of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaders have an often appalling effect:  Hitler, or Hussein,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or in fact any politician whose picture is prominently displayed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in public as some sort of &quot;Beloved Leader&quot;, often identify their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own personal interests with those of their nation, and such is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their control that they get away with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You don't believe any leader acts predominantly from 
<br>
self-interest or the interests of some sub-national group[s] 
<br>
s/he is part of?  This is a very wildly ahistorical statement. 
<br>
That the leaders may rationalize what they wish to do as being 
<br>
in the national interest in no way says that they are actually 
<br>
acting according to what they believe to be the national 
<br>
interest. Democracy has nothing to do with it really.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;The best systems would be ones that have the smallest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;percentage of people that need to be kept in check,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;stopping the problem before it starts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reverting to the level of individuals in society, yes!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;So then the argument is what is the best propaganda
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to send people so that they have very little ability
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to revert to these instincts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, on an individual level, it would be more fruitful to 
<br>
ask what living conditions would lead to the less perceived need 
<br>
for violence.  It is not a question of ability.  It is a 
<br>
question of choice.  Or are we attempting to persuade ourselves 
<br>
that human beings have no such control as most humans learn as 
<br>
children?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can not think of historical examples in which exhortations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maxims, education, or propaganda has had the desired effect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some cultures, e.g. the Amish or Quaker, do succeed sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in multiplying their numbers through peaceful living, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becoming a force against war.  But to the degree that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to credit them, it is their culture, I claim, not their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having succumbed to someone's propaganda that should get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the credit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What do you think is in their culture that leads to this outcome 
<br>
if it is not a set of shared and lived memes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (And moreover, it must be kept in mind that such cultures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to date have thrived only inside protective barriers erected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by democratic nations---barriers that keep such pacifistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communities from being quickly overrun by violent nomads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or other nations.)
</em><br>
<p>Actually, some of these peaceful cultures did a fabulous job of 
<br>
facing down or rather coming to amicable terms with violent 
<br>
groups around them.  See the Quakers interaction with Native 
<br>
American populations for a case in point.
<br>
<p>Without some training and dedication to looking for non-violent 
<br>
solutions (not necessarily as an absolute prohibition however), 
<br>
more violence than necessary will result.  In a world where 
<br>
large numbers are disenfranchised to a critical level, more 
<br>
apparent need to resort to violence will be felt and acted upon. 
<br>
In a world where preemptive violence is ok between nations, more 
<br>
nations and individuals will perceive themselves to be 
<br>
intolerably threatened.
