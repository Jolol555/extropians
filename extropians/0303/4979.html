<em>&gt; Subject: Re: [POLITICS/IRAQ] Thank God for the death of the UN (Article)
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;     American suburbia is full of Boomers who believe this stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's perfectly OK to have invisible friends provided they speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to you mostly on Sundays.  I do not know whether Georgius Secundus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is genuine, but *either* way his political personality is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; archetype, after the Clinton years many Americans are so relieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to have &quot;someone who isn't ashamed to be a Believer&quot; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; couldn't really care less about the economy.
</em><br>
<p>[Noah Horton] 
<br>
I think this is a serious mischaracterization of the desires of Americans.
<br>
Rather than being thought a better person for being &quot;a Believer,&quot; I think
<br>
Bush gained ground for having a concrete system of morality.  Clinton left
<br>
the country waiting for a President who could be trusted and who was above
<br>
the Leninist doctrine of all morality being subservient to political
<br>
expediency.  Gore could not provide that given his proximity to Clinton as
<br>
well as his questionable relationship with China.  Bush could provide such a
<br>
moral grounding, and furthermore, he has delivered on that grounding.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I would point out that historically, religious zeal is not
<br>
considered more important than fiscal policy.  Jimmy Carter was a highly
<br>
devout man but was not reelected because of the abysmal performance of the
<br>
economy during his presidency.  George Bush was not reelected in large part
<br>
because he raised taxes.  Bill Clinton was reelected despite his behavioral
<br>
problems in large part because the economy was doing well from the internet
<br>
boom.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;   For instance.. my Mom recently commented that this economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems might very well be God's way of allowing Satan to &quot;test&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the country and it's chosen Leader's commitment to a godly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; national culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     If Bush makes the proper noises, doesn't get caught with his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pants down (literally) and feeds the military/industrial complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whilst rembering to mention Yahweh frequently he is being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the essence of what his constituency desires....
</em><br>
<p>[Noah Horton] 
<br>
Hearing how religious your parents apparently are, it makes it more
<br>
understandable that you seem to be entirely put off by religious belief in a
<br>
leader.  I fail to understand how Bush is being so exceedingly religious.
<br>
His speeches make the requisite 'god blessed country' kind of comments, but
<br>
you get that from almost all leaders.  I suspect that it is actually the
<br>
moral statements that are being taken as being highly religious.  The
<br>
characterization of certain behavior and of certain regimes as evil simply
<br>
implies that he does have a built-in sense of morality that he uses as a
<br>
metric for behavior.  This is exactly what sane people are supposed to do.
<br>
Not doing so makes one psychopathic.  If the idea of such an ingrained
<br>
system of morality bothers you, then please read more of Lenin's writing,
<br>
you will probably find you agree with him. 
<br>
