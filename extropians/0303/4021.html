<em>&gt; Another justification for patents can be expressed in terms of transaction

<em>&gt; costs.  If there were no patents, people might try to protect their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innovations in other ways that could be quite expensive.  They could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrap their devices in elaborate self-destruct mechanisms, for example.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or they might reveal the workings to customers, but only in exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for a promise by the customer not to use the information or reveal it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to anyone else.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Needless to say, such contracts would be very difficult and expensive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce.  The transaction costs would be extremely high.  So the patent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system can be seen as a substitute for privately-negotiated contracts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like this, a sort of default contract which inventors can choose to make
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use of.  Or they can always try to protect their secrets in one of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The justification is then that if we did not have patents, inventors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would waste everyone's time, energy and money coming up with other ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to protect their ideas.  Patents would therefore reduce transaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs and make society run more efficiently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>This is a lot of assumption.  As an innovator myself I could 
<br>
care less about protecting my ideas.  What I most want is to get 
<br>
my innovations in common use and see my ideas be the springboard 
<br>
for still other ideas.  Money is not my primary motivation as 
<br>
long as I have enough to continue doing the things I am 
<br>
interested in.  I do not think I am alone in this.  So I find 
<br>
this argument for patents to be empty.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; It is interesting to observe how we are starting to see the results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of transaction costs falling for other private methods of protecting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual property.  The much-maligned Palladium technology from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Microsoft can be seen as a way of enforcing the kinds of agreements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed above, with regard to copyright.  You will only be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; download a movie, say, if you in effect agree to observe certain rules
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of handling the data.  Palladium technology is designed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lower transaction costs to the point where these kinds of contracts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can be efficient on a wide scale.  It can be seen as an alternative to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copyright that is non-coercive and relies solely on private agreements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, Palladium is ultimately coercive as the code 
<br>
becomes law that is inescapable and cannot be argued with or 
<br>
even necessarilly examined.
<br>
<p>I also do not agree that &quot;intellectual property&quot; without 
<br>
considerable subdivision and explanation, is a meaningful 
<br>
phrase.  At the very least there is a need for distinguishing 
<br>
between what is best handled as a commons versus what is best 
<br>
handled as some form of private property.  Not everything, and 
<br>
especially not all things resulting from use of the intellect, 
<br>
fall cleanly into the property side.   Such distinctions are 
<br>
crucial to these discussions.
