<p><em>&gt; In any case I still hope that Palladium and similar technology experiments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proceed and are allowed to compete in the marketplace with a wide variety
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of other approaches to handling intellectual property.  It would certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be preferable philosophically to find a way to encourage innovation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creativity without having the heavy hand of government forcing people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to honor contracts to which they had not agreed, as is effectively the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case with current patent and copyright laws.
</em><br>
<p>### This is a very interesting line of thought that I have been recently
<br>
coming closer to. If the producer of a piece of information (be it music or
<br>
knowledge embodied in a physical object) was really able to protect his
<br>
property while allowing wide access to it, but without having a
<br>
state-enforced monopoly, this might be actually better than the current
<br>
situation. Persons unwilling to accept the terms set out by the owner would
<br>
be free to compete by coming up with comparable information on their own,
<br>
which would provide incentives to produce useful information, identical to
<br>
the incentives in the production of other commodities. Still, not knowing
<br>
enough about technology, I wonder if it would be really possible to protect
<br>
information ownership rights without some significant restrictions on the
<br>
devices used for the transmission and reading of information. How does
<br>
Palladium work?
<br>
<p>I fully agree with the initial part of your analysis, since an appropriately
<br>
managed patent and copyright system IMO indeed reduces transaction costs and
<br>
allows the provision of useful goods which would otherwise not be provided.
<br>
The existence of the legal infrastructure of courts (whether private or
<br>
state run), capable of enforcing impartial decisions regarding private
<br>
contracts at will, is a prerequisite for a lot of business activity, such as
<br>
large banks, and other organizations too complex to rely exclusively on
<br>
informal methods of resolving disputes. Copyright law is a type of useful
<br>
infrastructure, and the question is not whether it works (because it does,
<br>
sort of), but whether better solutions can be found.
<br>
<p>This said, current US copyright law, essentially a perpetuity, is a total
<br>
mess, which frequently happens with systems amenable to political
<br>
manipulation against rational market forces.
