</em><br>
<p>In WWII, the US had a 2:3 kill ratio (2 germans killed for every American).
<br>
In Korea, the ratio was 4:1 (4 N Koreans/Chinese for each American).
<br>
In Vietnam, the ratio was 15:1.
<br>
In Gulf 1, the ratio was 400:1.
<br>
In Mogadishu, the ratio was 50:1, but US forces made many serious 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;operational errors (flying too low with lightly armored helicopters,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;driving through streets in unarmored trucks, no air support).  
<br>
<p>A conservative but realistic estimate might be 200:1, midway between 
<br>
Mogadishu and Gulf 1.  Assuming that Saddam has 150,000 loyal troops who 
<br>
will fight until they become casualties, US casualties can be estimated 
<br>
at 750.  Typically, 80% of casualties are wounded.  Thus US fatalities 
<br>
can be estimated at 150.
<br>
<p>Civilian casualties in Gulf 1 were estimated at 1 per 15 Iraqi soldiers.
<br>
Thus Iraqi civilian casualties can be estimated at 10,000, with about 
<br>
20% fatalities, or 2000.
<br>
<p>Based on these estimates I have not been particularly concerned about
<br>
Gulf 2.  It is generally known that traffic fatalities in the US run to 
<br>
about 80 per day, or 2400 per month.  So far, US war fatalities have run
<br>
to about 4 per day.
