This reply is almost certainly a lapse in judgement on my part. All 
<br>
ambulatory noncombatants, please relocate behind the yellow-and-black 
<br>
concrete revetments.

<p>It has been evident for some time now that you have very strong feelings, 
<br>
Mr. Mania. And that's fine; many of us do. Permit me to express some of 
<br>
mine. If you can be militant for pacifism, I think I can and must militate 
<br>
for--whatever my view is, if it can be fairly labeled. So here goes. Sorry 
<br>
for the long letter, I didn't have time to write a short one.
<br>
<p>This latest passionate post of yours trivializes the matters at hand, and 
<br>
suggests to me that you are perhaps feeling rather powerless.
<br>
<p>As Samantha and others have noted on this list, it is quite possible that 
<br>
the world stands on the threshold of WW IV (or III, take your pick), or the 
<br>
N+1th Crusade, or something just as full of pain and peril, but harder to 
<br>
label.
<br>
<p>Do you really, *really* find puking the most effective response?
<br>
<p>&lt;flame=HIGH&gt;
<br>
<p>If that's the best you can offer, I'd much prefer that you (personally) 
<br>
puke all over yourself and then simmer in it as you choke. Which is what 
<br>
you seem to be doing with this post. Good show! Feels good to puuuuuke, 
<br>
doesn't it--makes you HOLY, right? Holier than, well, just about anybody 
<br>
you're sure is a MONSTER, right? Keep it up, and don't mind the airway. 
<br>
Puking for change is FUN and PRODUCTIVE. Plus, in email, nobody has to 
<br>
smell it, or administer CPR. YOU BETCHA, you're REALLY going to show 
<br>
Troubleyou a thing or two.
<br>
<p>&lt;flame=OFF&gt;
<br>
<p>Maybe you actually have diagnosable mania. I have come close to wondering 
<br>
about myself once or twice; in those cases I sometimes felt righteous to 
<br>
the point of (on later reflection) absurdity. It's part of the pattern.
<br>
<p>&lt;flame=MEDIUM&gt;
<br>
<p>Get a clue. Until you're willing to set yourself on fire on the steps of 
<br>
the Capitol building, your impotent pointless posturing engenders my pity 
<br>
and contempt, even while I share some of your fears.
<br>
<p>I'll repeat that: ...EVEN WHILE I SHARE SOME OF YOUR FEARS, YOU ENGENDER MY 
<br>
PITY AND CONTEMPT.
<br>
<p>I hate reinstituting killfiles, I really do. But a &quot;SELF-INDULGENT 
<br>
SANCTIMONIOUS ASSHOLE&quot; email hotkey is substantially less civil, wouldn't 
<br>
you agree? Yes, announcing a PLONK is always, in large part, a self- 
<br>
indulgent thing. I wish I could bring myself to just silently killfile you-- 
<br>
but the fact is that my sentiments don't fit into your compartments and I 
<br>
felt/thought that the list deserved mine at least as much as yours. And 
<br>
just like puking, plonkng feeeels gooooooood. So I'm not claiming I'm that 
<br>
much better than you, no siree.
<br>
<p>I hope you actually get a grip someday (/again); these are hard times. In 
<br>
the meantime, accept
<br>
<p>My heartiest warm puke-soaked wishes,
<br>
<p>MMB
