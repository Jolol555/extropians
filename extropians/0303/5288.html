<p>
Since my previous comments with respect to when war
<br>
might be a utilitarian necessity only seemed to draw a few
<br>
(useful) offlist comments but Michael's recent comments on
<br>
perhaps a fundamental incompatibility between Islam and
<br>
[trans]humanity did stir the pot, I'm going to take another
<br>
shot at this.
<br>
<p>Lets start with Greg's pointing out Shermer's perspective
<br>
on cloning.  A URL that works for me is:
<br>
<a href="http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=00084EAF-2081-1E61-A98A809EC5880105">http://www.sciam.com/print_version.cfm?articleID=00084EAF-2081-1E61-A98A809EC5880105</a>
<br>
<p>Now lets take article 3 of his proposed laws of cloning:
<br>
<p>3. A human clone is to be accorded the dignity and respect due any member
<br>
of our species.
<br>
<p>This is a critical value that must be dealt with in the evolution
<br>
of [trans]humanity.  Humanity doesn't even come close to providing
<br>
other humans with &quot;dignity and respect&quot;.  We can cite examples
<br>
from the Saddam Fedayeen (I would encourage some of the people
<br>
on the list to consider whether we can even classify these people
<br>
as &quot;human&quot;) to simply the average person walking down the street
<br>
in any of the more developed countries who is unaware of the large
<br>
numbers of people in Bangladesh who are being poisoned by arsenic
<br>
in their drinking water.
<br>
<p>The question becomes -- how does one deal with people void of
<br>
any &quot;dignity and respect&quot; for others of our species?
<br>
<p>And then how are we to deal with expansion of the disparities
<br>
between what one might consider &quot;members of our species&quot;?
<br>
<p>One can see the tip of the iceberg now in terms of wealth disparities
<br>
but it is going to become much more significant when that evolves
<br>
into intelligence or genetic engineering disparities.  The cloning
<br>
debate is but a melted drop on the tip of the iceberg compared
<br>
with what seems possible.
<br>
