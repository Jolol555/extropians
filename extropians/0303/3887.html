<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It remains for us only to determine how much run time people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ---including ourselves---are to get.  And of course, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answer failing to specify the maximum possible fails to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attain the highest morality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, perhaps you can re-style yourself The Speaker for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Underinstantiated.  Rather than rescuing people from non-existence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can strive to maximize the total quantity of sentient existence.
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  It's a no-go.  Everyone is underinstantiated, and
<br>
it makes no sense to be &quot;speaker for everyone&quot;.  Before,
<br>
I was reacting to the arrogance of the instantiated, who
<br>
so often dismissed away the needs of the uninstantiated,
<br>
who in turn themselves seemed to have no advocate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of the paradoxes that I have always struggled with is this: if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run exactly the same conscious program twice, does it matter?  Does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase the &quot;measure&quot; or &quot;probability&quot; of that conscious experience?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do I do good by re-running someone's pleasant experience, and harm by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-running a bad one?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, yes, and yes.  At moments like this, I see with utter
<br>
clarity the benefits of repeated experience.  I feel only
<br>
sorry that others have some kind of unconscious goals or
<br>
aspects of their self-images that make repeated experience
<br>
seem repugnant.  But it is late, and I'm being uncharitable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The reason it's a paradox is because re-runs are particularly prone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; philosophical slippery-slope arguments where we blur the lines between an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;actual&quot; re-run and what amounts to a picture of one.  I won't recap the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments here, they have been discussed ad infinitum in the archives.
</em><br>
<p>It's utterly crazy to think that a picture of a suffering child suffers.
<br>
<p>And how brilliant and professional philosophers like Hilary Putnam can
<br>
*find* every possible child or civilization in every stone defies belief.
<br>
At moments like these, endorsing a Theory of Dust---in which information
<br>
never flows, but is only statically represented---seems utterly wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The point is that only re-runs are susceptible to these arguments;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fresh runs doing novel calculations cannot be replaced by pictures of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves because the pictures won't exist until the calculation is done.
</em><br>
<p>Yes!  Now THAT is exactly right.  But...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This has led me to consider the possibility that re-runs don't count,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they carry no experiential (and therefore moral) weight.
</em><br>
<p>How do you go suddenly to that?  A calculation is a real-time
<br>
*****process*****, and as such it implements information flow.
<br>
Whether a picture exists, before a calculation, during a calculation,
<br>
or after a calculation is completely unimportant.  I tell you,
<br>
Mao Ze Dong got satisfaction only from *seeing* all those pictures
<br>
of himself, never even once from being any of them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, the notion of many-worlds at Tegmark's level 1 and 2 suggests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we do have to consider identical universes to add to the measure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and probability of the experiences they contain.  We have all these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identical Earths, and for probability to work right we need to assume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the total probability for a given experience is proportional to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fraction of Earths where that experience happens, even though many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them will be identical.  Therefore identical calculations must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counted and added separately in considering their contribution to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overall probabilities of experience.
</em><br>
<p>That is the horn of your &quot;paradox&quot; that I totally agree with.
<br>
Consider even the argument from philosophical continuity:
<br>
We have two almost identical Hal Finneys in separate solar
<br>
systems, and (somehow it's obvious to me that) each is getting
<br>
great benefit from his life.  We change one atom.  Now suddenly
<br>
they're identical, and the total benefit goes from two to one?
<br>
Preposterous.
<br>
<p>But you are right.  This has been hashed through many times
<br>
in the archives.  Nonetheless (at this late hour) I express
<br>
the hope that everyone will come to see that I have been
<br>
right.  ;-)  The level one infinite universe practically
<br>
proves it.  Since there are other Lees exactly like me
<br>
only 10^10^29 meters away, the sudden demise of any particular
<br>
one shouldn't be of any concern if repeated experience had no
<br>
value.  But we know better.
<br>
<p>Now we have yet another case where the pointer this* is
<br>
multiple valued, and we cannot blithely speak of &quot;this&quot;
<br>
solar system, or this Earth.  We may, of course, speak
<br>
of &quot;any one&quot; as I did in the last paragraph.
