In response to Lee Crocker Daniel's comments.
<br>
<p>I think that there might be some confusion about how I use
<br>
'acceptance'. I said that the acceptance of 'what is' must be there
<br>
before change. Perhaps a better word is 'acknowledgement'.
<br>
<p>For example, imagine that you have a conflict with your spouse, but
<br>
you can't get your fingers around what is the difficulty precisely,
<br>
so the two of you make an appointment with a counselor/psychologist
<br>
to help you figure it out. Hopefully the psychologist can provide a
<br>
pointer, and the two of you can say 'aha, that's it, and then begins
<br>
the hard work to change oneself. You can't begin to change until you
<br>
know what is there.
<br>
<p>Similarly with bodies. Look at the people you know who spend hours
<br>
in front of the computer without breaks, eating, bathroom, and so
<br>
on. Suddenly they realize that their body is screaming for attention
<br>
to take care of something. Unfortunately this simple phenomenon
<br>
where people forget that they are living 'inside' of something
<br>
precious that requires care and attention is pretty common. (Many
<br>
don't take good care of themselves until something goes wrong- the
<br>
body breaks, they get sick, a heart attack, or something else.)
<br>
<p>Now the acknowledgement that we have bodies is a different subject
<br>
than what that body looks like. Acknowledge of what is there in my
<br>
perspective is part of the necessity to know oneself, learn, and
<br>
change. I probably sound like a tape recorder by now when I say that
<br>
'I believe that the universe within is as vast as the universe
<br>
without'. Learning to 'be', including to be without the myriad of
<br>
trappings of society is part of knowing yourself. For transhumans,
<br>
to change, requires first what you acknowledge what is there and if
<br>
it is valuable or not to you.
<br>
<p>The drive towards a particular body appearance has it's own set of
<br>
wonders and complications and psychology, but I consider that a
<br>
little bit of a different topic.
