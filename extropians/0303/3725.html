Here's something that all of us in the US should go through with, from the
<br>
CR Society list.
<br>
<p>Please pass on to other appropriate lists and people as you see fit.

<em>&gt; Subject: OFF TOPIC Therapeutic Cloning Bills: Get Active!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Debate is opening on 2 bills in the House &amp; Senate in the 'States. One
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  bans ALL somatic cell nuclear transfer, including that for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therapeutic cloning; one bans reproductive cloning but explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opens the doors for therapeutic cloning. See &quot;Dummies&quot; summary of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2 bills here:

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is an EXTREMELY important avenue of research, at the very least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for folks suffering with a variety of really nasty diseases &amp;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially for the rest of us as well. The results of SCNT research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could lead to other breakthru's even if SCNT never becomes viable as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therapy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there isn't explicit legalization of research in the 'States, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the uncertainty will scare investors away from serious, long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investment into the research. Offshore work won't do. If you're  a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life extensionist or a compassionate human being, you need to take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trouble to raise your voice &amp; engage in the process of pushing open
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this closing door.

<p>Michael, thanks for calling our attention to this important issue.  I
<br>
happen to agree strongly with you (against a ban on therapeutic cloning
<br>
research), and do not intend this message to begin an (off-topic, IMO)
<br>
debate on the issue.  What I would like to do is call people's attention
<br>
to several convenient methods people can use to express their opinion to
<br>
their elected officials on this or any other issue.
<br>
<p>The first is the President's comment line: 202-456-1111.  Call this
<br>
number and a human operator will answer and you can leave a comment for
<br>
the President on any issue you'd like.  Unfortunately, I tried it today,
<br>
and got a message that due to the inclement weather, the comment line is
<br>
temporarily closed :-(.
<br>
<p>The second is this website:
<br>
<p><a href="http://congress.org/">http://congress.org/</a>
<br>
<p>Here, all you have to do is enter your zip code and you will be given
<br>
the opportunity to send an email message to each of your congressman
<br>
and/or the President.  In addition, for a small fee ($4.95), they will
<br>
even print out and hand deliver your message to your congressman's
<br>
office, for &quot;extra impact&quot;, although I'm not sure how much extra impact
<br>
such hand delivery would have.
<br>
<p>So please, express your opinion to your government representatives on
<br>
issues you care about.  In this age of technology it is very easy to do.
<br>
<p>- Dean
