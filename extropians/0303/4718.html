<em>&gt; &gt; The current situation can be differentiated from Kosovo in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unlike with Kosovo, the Security Council is &quot;seized of the matter&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the US has by signing off on 1441 acknowledged that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; UN Security Council is seized of the matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They seized the matter and then took a nap, the New York Times
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had a interesting article on Monday about how that came about.
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; When the USA was thinking about bringing 1441 to the UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Secretary Of State Powell first talked to Jacques Chirac the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President of France, Chirac encouraged Powell to do it. Powell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said don't vote for it unless you are prepared to enforce it. Chirac
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said don't worry you have my personal assurance that France will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stand by you when the time comes. This is the reason this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration feels such rage against France, to be stabbed in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back by somebody you thought of as a friend is disturbing.
</em><br>
<p>It seemed to me that President Chirac may have surprised by the 
<br>
diplomatic tactics employed by President Bush. It was after all 
<br>
President Bush's judgement and not Secretary of State Colin
<br>
Powell's, that he, (Chirac), had to reckon on as being decisive in 
<br>
setting the US position.  
<br>
<p>Perhaps President Chirac took President Bush statements about
<br>
getting the security council members to put their cards on the table,
<br>
regardless of the outcome, so to speak, as a exercise in political
<br>
brinkmanship with him that President Bush would not back away
<br>
from. Indeed, given that the only operative provision in the
<br>
proposed resolution mooted by Spain, the UK and the US was 
<br>
to determine that the &quot;final opportunity&quot; under 1441 had passed, 
<br>
I know that I suspected that President Bush's intent was to put each
<br>
of the security council members who did not wish to take military
<br>
action into the spotlight and make them argue in front of each other
<br>
and the whole world that the &quot;final opportunity&quot; in 1441 had not 
<br>
passed.
<br>
<p>I reckon President Chirac probably did not have to fake surprise
<br>
that President Bush did not call for a vote that he had so publicly
<br>
stated he would call for. Who would have bet that President Bush
<br>
would blink in an exercise in brinkmanship after setting it up himself
<br>
in front of the media and in front of the American people?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
<br>
<p>PS: Have you noticed how often our elected leaders upon whose
<br>
personal judgement so much relies make use of the word belief ?
<br>
<p>Maybe its just me. Every time I hear it, it's like I mentally substitute
<br>
the word &quot;belief&quot; with the phrase &quot;you may be wise to consider I
<br>
may have suspended critical thought when I say&quot;..
<br>
<p>It sounds to me like I imagine the Iraqi leaderships statements
<br>
interspersed with &quot;God willing&quot; sound to other folks. Perhaps
<br>
someone ought to invent a 'Geiger counter' for such terms. I heard
<br>
Prime Minister Howard doing quite a bit of &quot;believing&quot; in his
<br>
statement tonight after the Opposition leader handed the media
<br>
legal advice critiquing that offered to him (Howard) and stating
<br>
that military action in the circumstances was illegal.
