In reaction to Ramez's posts, I sent along the following message to
<br>
Dayna Dye of the Life Extension Foundation.  Dayna's response follows.

<br>
Dayna Dye:
<br>
<p>I'm a member of the Extropians email (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/</a> ) list where life extension is a
<br>
regular topic of discussion.  Another member of that list, Ramez Naam,
<br>
claims:
<br>
<p>&quot;The LEF is not, to my knowledge, funding or conducting any serious
<br>
anti-aging research.  They seem to focus their efforts on selling
<br>
products of questionable value rather than attempting to develop truly
<br>
effective interventions against aging.&quot;
<br>
<p>(I include the original post below under the title &quot;first message.&quot;
<br>
[I'm not including Ramez's post to save space.])
<br>
<p>In a follow up post, Ramez asserts:
<br>
<p>&quot;I mean it in the sense that there's little or no evidence that most of
<br>
the products they sell actually slow down the aging process or extend
<br>
life.  In many cases (DHEA, anti-oxidant vitamins, etc..) there's
<br>
evidence showing that they in fact *don't* slow the aging process or
<br>
extend life in humans.
<br>
<p>&quot;The LEF chooses to sell these substances anyway.  Their marketing
<br>
material has long lists of studies that support (however indirectly)
<br>
their claims that these products can lengthen your life.   But they fail
<br>
to report on the important studies refuting these claims.  To me, that
<br>
seems unethical.  At the very least it's unscientific.
<br>
<p>In any case, for most of the substances they sell, there's just not
<br>
enough evidence to know one way or another.  There's also not enough
<br>
safety data to know how they'll affect humans in large doses or over the
<br>
long term.  That's &quot;questionable value&quot; in my book.&quot;
<br>
<p>(I include the original post below under the title &quot;second message.&quot;
<br>
[I'm not including Ramez's post to save space.])
<br>
<p>I'd like to know if you or someone from LEF could rebutt Ramez Naam's
<br>
claim.  [snip]
<br>
<p>If anyone wishes to respond to Ramez on the list, I can pass the message
<br>
along to the list or see <a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/</a>  for
<br>
information on how to post to that list independently.
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<p>Thank you for your time and attention.
<br>
<p>I am most sincerely,
<br>
<p>Daniel Ust
<br>
<p>Here follow Dayna's response.

Subject: RE: Rebuttal requested
<br>
<p><p>Dear Mr Ust:
<br>
<p>For information concerning research funded by the Life Extension
<br>
Foundation see:
<br>
<a href="http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/track.html">http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/track.html</a>
<br>
<p>Concerning the products we sell in order to fund that research, some
<br>
have been shown to extend mean lifespan in animal studies.  There have
<br>
been no studies showing that nutritional supplements extend or do not
<br>
extend maximum lifespan in humans.  You would need to design a study
<br>
that was at least 120 years in length.  Even a study showing that a
<br>
particular nutrient extends mean lifespan would need to last a century.
<br>
The only human study that comes to mind of this nature was published in
<br>
the March 3 2001 issue of the Lancet (2001; 357:657-63), concerning
<br>
vitamin C levels being associated with lower mortality over the four
<br>
year period of the study.
<br>
<p>Based on animal studies and on the knowledge that reducing the risk of
<br>
certain diseases can extend mean lifespan (and there are plenty of
<br>
studies to show that various nutrients do reduce the risk of many
<br>
diseases) it is safe to say that supplementing one's diet may help to
<br>
extend one's life. Even the one therapy that has been proven to extend
<br>
maximum lifespan in every species of animal in which it was tried,
<br>
calorie restriction, has not been proven to extend human lifespan, but
<br>
we consider it a safe bet to say that it will.   It is unfortunate that
<br>
most people don't have the self-discipline to attempt it.
<br>
<p>When negative studies concerning supplements are published, we do take
<br>
the time to investigate and have published rebuttals
<br>
<a href="http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/may2000_vitamin_c_03.html">http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/may2000_vitamin_c_03.html</a>
<br>
<a href="http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/may2000_canasads_01.html">http://www.lef.org/featured-articles/may2000_canasads_01.html</a>   .
<br>
Sometimes there are flaws in the study revealed by other articles that
<br>
we have published on our website's front page Life Extension Daily News
<br>
feature (archived at <a href="http://www.lef.org/newsarchive/">http://www.lef.org/newsarchive/</a>) .  Frequently
<br>
there is a negative study on a subject for which there may be several
<br>
positive studies - hence the public's surprise when these findings are
<br>
released.    When one negative study appears to contradict several
<br>
positive studies, one needs to look at study design to see if this could
<br>
be why different results have occurred.  Additionally, there are
<br>
negative findings and unwanted effects associated with everything,
<br>
nutritional supplements included.  Our website has 6,000 pages of
<br>
information but we have not posted every positive and negative abstract
<br>
on every nutritional supplement.  Nevertheless, if there are warnings or
<br>
contraindications for any supplement, these are posted in the product
<br>
information pages of our website <a href="http://www.lef.org/prod_desc/index.html">http://www.lef.org/prod_desc/index.html</a>

<p>For longer life,
