24 mechanical actuators pulling a foam-rubber face in just the right

<br>
<p>Newsfactor - &quot;We definitely are not trying to find a miracle drug that
<br>
you start taking when you're 20 and you live longer,&quot; said McGill
<br>
University geneticist Siegfried Hekimi. Instead, the drugs he envisions
<br>
would be used to prevent or cure age-dependent diseases. Scientists
<br>
reported new research Wednesday showing that limiting caloric intake and
<br>
certain genetic mutations can extend the lifespan of animals and could
<br>
lead the way to drugs that mimic this effect in humans. Such techniques
<br>
could extend the human lifespan by 20 years or more, they said.

Drug-resistant superbug now hitting the healthy

<br>
<p>Ananova - Scientists have warned a drug-resistant superbug that has
<br>
swept through US hospitals infecting patients is now hitting healthy
<br>
people. MRSA normally enters the wounds of patients weakened by disease
<br>
or injury, and is especially dangerous after surgery. But a new strain,
<br>
which can be transmitted simply by skin contact and poses a risk to
<br>
healthy people, has emerged. [Most people don't realize the possibility,
<br>
that some sort of superbug can develop which can have enormous death
<br>
tolls on world wide basis. Setting us all back by decades. - Max M]

<p>ABC - Boy’s Own Blood Used for First-of-Its-Kind Stem Cell Transplant.
<br>
In the first operation of its kind, doctors used stem cells from a
<br>
16-year-old Almont, Mich., boy's own blood to repair his heart after he
<br>
was accidentally shot in the heart with a nail gun and subsequently
<br>
suffered a heart attack. [Repairing heart muscle with stem cells is good

research into building entire replacement organs, which is one route to

Reeve: Reduce Limitations on Stem Cell Research

<a href="http://sci.newsfactor.com/perl/story/20893.html">http://sci.newsfactor.com/perl/story/20893.html</a>
<br>
<p>Newsfactor - Reeve faulted Bush for having &quot;no consistent moral view&quot; of
<br>
stem cell research, and expressed his frustration with the president's
<br>
2001 bioethics panel, which he said was &quot;stacked&quot; with theologians at
<br>
the expense of scientists.&quot;Superman&quot; star Christopher Reeve yesterday
<br>
urged scientific elites at Harvard and MIT to exercise some political
<br>
muscle and protect their ability to conduct embryonic stem cell research
<br>
in the face of increasing federal restrictions. A guest of the MIT and
<br>
Harvard Hippocratic Societies' joint 2003 Conference on Neuroscience,
<br>
Reeve, who was paralyzed in a 1995 equestrian event, addressed a crowd
<br>
of about 150 students and faculty in Cambridge.

<p>Betterhumans - Researchers are close to breakthroughs in neural
<br>
interfaces, meaning we could soon mesh our minds with machines. If
<br>
you're like most people, you've fantasized about downloading Spanish 101
<br>
directly into your skull. That dream may become reality sooner than you
<br>
think. The prosthetic cochlear implant, for example, is now a commonly
<br>
used treatment for deafness. Doctors routinely implant electrode arrays
<br>
into the cochlea, which stimulate nerve fibers to restore hearing.

<br>
<p>Betterhumans - A neural interface is any type of data link between the
<br>
human nervous system and an external device, such as a computer or a
<br>
remote-controlled machine. Such a link can allow information
<br>
transmission to the nervous system, from the nervous system or in both
<br>
directions. Neural interfaces promise to improve the link between humans
<br>
and machines, empowering people in the process. The devices extend human
<br>
abilities by allowing people to benefit from what machines are good at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;such as brute computation -- without sacrificing human control.

Stupidity should be cured, says DNA discoverer
<br>
==============================================

<a href="http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993451">http://www.newscientist.com/news/news.jsp?id=ns99993451</a>
<br>
<p>New Scientist - Fifty years to the day from the discovery of the
<br>
structure of DNA, one of its co-discoverers has caused a storm by
<br>
suggesting that stupidity is a genetic disease that should be cured. On
<br>
28 February 1953 biologists James Watson and Francis Crick discovered
<br>
the structure of DNA - the chemical code for all life. The breakthrough
<br>
revealed how genetic information is passed from one generation to the
<br>
next and revolutionised biology and medicine. But in a documentary
<br>
series to be screened in the UK on Channel 4, Watson says that low
<br>
intelligence is an inherited disorder and that molecular biologists have
<br>
a duty to devise gene therapies or screening tests to tackle stupidity.

The Hazards of Transhumanist Living

<br>
<p>Betterhumans - It's not easy being a Transhumanist, but somebody has to
<br>
do it. Late last year the Toronto Transhumanist Association was asked to
<br>
set up a booth at the Ontario Skeptics Society's Psychic Unfair, an
<br>
annual gathering of skeptics, rationalists and scientifically oriented
<br>
groups and individuals. Simon Smith and I, the founding members of the
<br>
TTA, figured that we would be right at home in this environment.
<br>
Moreover, it marked our first opportunity to present Transhumanist ideas
<br>
to the public. [A good personal account of what it is like advocating
<br>
transhumanism to the general public, friends and families. - Max M]
