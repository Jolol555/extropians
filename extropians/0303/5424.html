<p>
I can't resist saying that I'm sick and tired of the discussion about
<br>
the war on this list.  There's a level at which -- as I've said before
<br>
-- discussion of the war, and the reasons for opposing or supporting it,
<br>
is appropriate to this list.  But there's a kind of hyperbolic rhetoric
<br>
that HAS to stop, or I *WILL* act to impose some decorum (with or
<br>
without UN support).
<br>
<p>Almost everyone has strong feelings about the war, and being exposed to
<br>
people whose views utterly differ from one's own can be emotionally
<br>
inflammatory -- I know it is for me.  It takes effort to exercise
<br>
self-control in the face of what one may feel to be idiocy, perhaps even
<br>
dangerous idiocy.  But I am going to make a civil appeal to all list
<br>
members to TONE DOWN THE RHETORIC.
<br>
<p>Now, so it's clear and we can get it all out in the open, let's identify
<br>
the hot buttons.  Strong opponents of the war find expressions of
<br>
warlike sentiment -- even the vocabulary of war -- offensive and
<br>
inflammatory.  Supporters of the war find the expression of pacifist
<br>
sentiments in the current situation simplistic and infuriating.  For
<br>
better or worse, expressions of U.S. nationalism are inflammatory in the
<br>
current situation, as are statements in opposition to American
<br>
nationalism.  At the extremes, the gulf of misunderstanding is utterly
<br>
unbridgeable while the war lasts.  People on both sides of the issue
<br>
need to simply accept that.  Further flame wars serve absolutely no
<br>
purpose and are, at this point, driving members away from the list.  If
<br>
you can't resist the temptation to use inflammatory rhetoric during this
<br>
crisis, I ask that you consider abstaining from posting -- or even
<br>
reading the list altogether, if that's what it takes -- until the war is
<br>
over, the dust has settled and it might be possible for you to come back
<br>
to the party with a cooler head.
