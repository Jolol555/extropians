I wonder if anyone has read some of the Libertarian arguments supporting the

war?

<p>Here are some that showed up on FND or RRND

Weekly Standard

<br>
<p>&quot;So, to our neo-hawk liberal friends: Welcome to the club; we're happy to
<br>
have you along. But remember that the objects of your scorn -- even that
<br>
notoriously 'flighty thinker,' George W. Bush -- were right about Iraq
<br>
months or even years before you saw the light. So please, check your
<br>
smugness and condescension at the door.&quot;

<br>
Frontiers of Freedom
<br>
by Kerri Houston
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Anyone in America with any sense ... would tell you that the possible
<br>
war in Iraq is not about oil, but has to do with protecting Americans ...,
<br>
presenting a clear and resolute foreign policy, and protecting Saddam's
<br>
neighbors and his own people from attack by his nasty weapons of mass
<br>
destruction. But they would be wrong.&quot; (2/24/03)

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;It is a painful reminder of human folly, irresponsibility, and
<br>
exhibitionism that millions of 'anti-war' demonstrators have somehow

convinced themselves that they have some special aversion

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to war. No sane human being wants war.&quot;

<br>
<p>Anti War.com &quot;top ten bogus justifcations for the IRaqi War&quot; conspicuously
<br>
absent from these 'top ten' are 1) Saddam is a murderous tyrant and has
<br>
killed ~400,000 of his own people 2) Saddam is a murderous Tyrant that
<br>
controls the worlds second largest energy supply and 3) no one is free
<br>
unless everyone is free, corrupt murderous tyrants need to go ASAP.
<br>
Included, however are arguments such as (which I have never heard) 1) A War
<br>
Will Save the US Economy 2) Because We're Already There. Funny how some of
<br>
the best pro war arguments are left out, but some of the lamest are
<br>
included. -

<p>Top ten bogus justifications for the Iraqi war
<br>
----------
<br>
Antiwar.com
<br>
by Christopher Deliso
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;[T]oppling the flimsy foundations on which the pro-war edifice rests is
<br>
not a very difficult matter. While the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;War Party's fraudulent justifications for war are myriad, debunking the
<br>
top ten will suffice.&quot; (3/5/03)

<br>
<p>&quot;If I took that advice, and did not insist on disarmament, yes, there would
<br>
be no war. But there would still be Saddam. Many of the people marching will
<br>
say they hate Saddam. But the consequences of taking their advice is that he
<br>
stays in charge of Iraq, ruling the Iraqi people. A country that in 1978,
<br>
the year before he seized power, was richer than Malaysia or Portugal. A
<br>
country where today, 135 out of every 1000 Iraqi children die before the age
<br>
of five - 70% of these deaths are from diarrhoea and respiratory infections
<br>
that are easily preventable. Where almost a third of children born in the
<br>
centre and south of Iraq have chronic malnutrition. &quot;
<br>
<p>And
<br>
<p>&quot;But as you watch your TV pictures of the march, ponder this: If there are
<br>
500,000 on that march, that is still less than the number of people whose
<br>
deaths Saddam has been responsible for. If there are one million, that is
<br>
still less than the number of people who died in the wars he started.&quot;

<br>
<p>&quot;We have listened to the latest announcements from your government and
<br>
opposition stating that your main objective is not the regime change but
<br>
disarmament! This is worrying for the Iraqi people. We believe that the only
<br>
way forward is simultaneous removal of any weapons of mass destruction and
<br>
regime change. This would be the starting point of restoring any peace in
<br>
the Middle East.&quot;
<br>
<p>And
<br>
<p>&quot;I want to ask those who support the anti - &quot;war&quot; movement (apart from
<br>
pacifists - that is a totally different situation) their motives and
<br>
reasoning behind such support. You may feel that America is trying to blind
<br>
you from seeing the truth about their real reasons for an invasion. I must
<br>
argue that in fact, you are still blind to the bigger truths in Iraq. I must
<br>
ask you to consider the following questions:
<br>
<p>-Saddam has murdered more than a million Iraqis over the past 30 years, are
<br>
you willing to allow him to kill another million Iraqis?
<br>
<p>-Out of a population of 20 million, 4 million Iraqis have been forced to
<br>
flee their country during Saddam's reign. Are you willing to ignore the real
<br>
and present danger that caused so many people to leave their homes and
<br>
families?
<br>
<p>-Saddam rules Iraq using fear - he regularly imprisons, executes and
<br>
tortures the mass population for no reason whatsoever - this may be hard to
<br>
believe and you may not even appreciate the extent of such barbaric acts,
<br>
but believe me you will be hard pressed to find a family in Iraq who have
<br>
not had a son/father/brother killed, imprisoned, tortured and/or
<br>
&quot;disappeared&quot; due to Saddam's regime. What has been stopping you from taking
<br>
to the streets to protest against such blatant crimes against humanity in
<br>
the past?
<br>
<p>-Saddam gassed thousands of political prisoners in one of his campaigns to
<br>
&quot;cleanse&quot; prisons - why are you not protesting against this barbaric act?
<br>
<p>-An example of the dictator's policy you are trying to save - Saddam has
<br>
made a law to give excuse to any man to rape a female relative and then
<br>
murder her in the name of adultery. Do you still want to march to keep him
<br>
in power?
