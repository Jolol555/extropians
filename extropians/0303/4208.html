MMB:
<br>
<em>&gt;Frankly, I don't think General Buck Turgidson would let a little lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tail stop him from doing his duty. Kubrick had it righter than Arstophanes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for my money.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<em>&gt;PS: Clue for those in need: General Buck Turgidson was the SAC-War Room
</em><br>
<em>&gt;officer played to the hilt by George C. Scott in _Doctor Strangelove, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb_; I suppose that's harder
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to get performance rights for than anything Arstophanes wrote. Hmm. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonder...
</em><br>
<p><p>I adore this movie...! It might have a universal appeal that
<br>
cuts across cultural boundaries too. Once I encouraged this
<br>
movie to be chosen for a movie party of a group of friends from
<br>
Max Planck- no one else had seen the movie, and as we watched
<br>
the film, they laughed as hard as I was laughing (and I've seen
<br>
it six or more times by now). I think the nationalities that day
<br>
were Norwegian, German, Australian, Greek, Italian, American (me).
<br>
<p>Did you know that Kubrick filmed a full scene of a War Room pie fight,
<br>
that was later cut from the final movie? I wish it would have made
<br>
it in. Here are some cut views of the pie fight scene. Great stuff.
<br>
<p>... General Turgidson emerges completely creamed out, and
<br>
Dr. Merkwurdigichliebe, aka Dr. Strangelove, emerges cream-free.
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Underground/9798/piefight.htm">http://www.geocities.com/SunsetStrip/Underground/9798/piefight.htm</a>
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Meanwhile, parallel to the pie-fight sequence, another sequence is
<br>
occurring. At about the time that the first pie is thrown, Dr.
<br>
Strangelove raises himself from his wheelchair. Then, looking rather
<br>
wild-eyed, he shouts, &quot;Mein Fuhrer, I can valk!&quot; He takes a
<br>
triumphant step forward and pitches flat on his face. He immediately
<br>
tries to regain the wheelchair, snaking his way across the floor,
<br>
which is so highly polished and slippery that the wheelchair scoots
<br>
out of reach as soon as Strangelove touches it. We intercut between
<br>
the pie fight and Strangelove's snakelike movements -- reach and
<br>
scoot, reach and scoot -- which suggest a curious, macabre pas de
<br>
deux. When the chair finally reaches the wall, it shoots sideways
<br>
across the floor and comes to a stop ten feet away, hopelessly out
<br>
of reach. Strangelove, exhausted and dejected, pulls himself up so
<br>
that he is sitting on the floor, his back against the wall at the
<br>
far end of the War Room. He stares for a moment at the surreal
<br>
activity occurring there, the pie fight appearing like a distant,
<br>
blurry, white blizzard. The camera moves in on Strangelove as he
<br>
gazes, expressionless now, at the distant fray. Then, unobserved by
<br>
him, his right hand slowly rises, moves to the inner pocket of his
<br>
jacket and, with considerable stealth, withdraws a German Luger
<br>
pistol and moves the barrel toward his right temple. The hand
<br>
holding the pistol is seized at the last minute by the free hand and
<br>
both grapple for its control. The hand grasping the wrist prevails
<br>
and is able to deflect the pistol's aim so that when it goes off
<br>
with a tremendous roar, it misses the temple. The explosion
<br>
reverberates with such volume that the pie fight freezes. A tableau,
<br>
of white and ghostly aspect: Strangelove stares for a moment before
<br>
realizing that he has gained the upper hand. &quot;Gentlemen,&quot; he calls
<br>
out to them. &quot;Enough of these childish games. Vee hab vork to do.
<br>
Azzemble here pleeze!&quot; For a moment, no one moves. Then a solitary
<br>
figure breaks rank: It is General Turgidson, who walks across the
<br>
room to the wheelchair and pushes it over to the stricken
<br>
Strangelove. &quot;May I help you into your chair, Doctor?&quot; he asks. He
<br>
begins wheeling Strangelove across the War Room floor, which is now
<br>
about half a foot deep in custard pie. They move slowly until they
<br>
reach the president and the Russian ambassador who are sitting
<br>
crosslegged, facing each other, building a sandcastle. &quot;What in Sam
<br>
Hill --&quot; mutters General Turgidson. &quot;Ach,&quot; says Strangelove. &quot;I
<br>
think their minds have snapped under the strain. Perhaps they will
<br>
have to be institutionalized.&quot;
<br>
<p>As they near the pie-covered formation of generals and admirals,
<br>
General Turgidson announces gravely: &quot;Well, boys, it looks like the
<br>
future of this great land of ours is going to be in the hands of
<br>
people like Dr. Strangelove here. So let's hear three for the good
<br>
doctor!&quot; And as he pushes off again, the eerie formation raise their
<br>
voices in a thin, apparition-like lamentation: &quot;Hip, hip, hooray,
<br>
hip, hip, hooray!&quot; followed by Vera Lynn's rendition of &quot;We'll Meet
<br>
Again.&quot; The camera is up and back in a dramatic long shot as General
<br>
Turgidson moves across the War Room floor in a metaphorical visual
<br>
marriage of Mad Scientist and United States Military. The End. &quot;
<br>
