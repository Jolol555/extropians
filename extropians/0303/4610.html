<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    &gt;The USA will be acting against international law and YOU KNOW IT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But that's exactly the problem, many of us don't know it. You claim to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that knowledge so tell us, exactly what &quot;international law&quot; did the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; violate, what are the penalties for transgressors, how are they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforced,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where are they written down, where can I see the signature of the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agreeing to these regulations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The international law (German: Voelkerrecht = people's law) Bush is now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting against is written down in the charta of the United Nations. And I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember that the USA signed at least *this* treaty. And therein it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated that a preemptive war is against international law if it is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approved by the security council of the UN. 
</em><br>
<p>[Noah Horton]
<br>
However, article X states that any country can engage in war for the purpose
<br>
of self-defense with security council sanction.  One of the defenses is that
<br>
this is defensive as he has shown willingness to use WMD before and is
<br>
massing them again.  The more poignant reason why this is not against
<br>
international law is that previous resolutions against Iraq have authorized
<br>
the use of force if Iraq was found to be in breech of disarmament orders,
<br>
and 1441 stated that they were in violation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should really start turning to European news sources from now on. At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least here in Germany we can read the statements of all dominant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the world who condemn Bushs announcement of his solo effort last night
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and his violation of international law. Even the German Christian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conservative party, for almost 60 years now on excellent terms with every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US administration, is somehow shocked about the way Bush disregards the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UN security council.
</em><br>
<p>[Noah Horton] 
<br>
Not all European news sources are that critical (BBC for example).  As for
<br>
&quot;all the dominant governments&quot;, that is either incredible
<br>
central-europe-centric or blatant hyperbole.  The US, UK, Italy, Spain,
<br>
Japan and Australia are all pretty high on the dominant governments list.
<br>
If you want to talk about slightly smaller countries, most of eastern Europe
<br>
and the Netherlands support the US.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nobody will officially punish the US for this transgressing. So you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to worry :-) but your country has lost friends by the dozens.
</em><br>
<p>[Noah Horton] 
<br>
When the dust has settled, we will see how many countries count the US as
<br>
their friend and how many count France and Germany.  I would point out that
<br>
much of the world, such as eastern European states and the UK, still
<br>
remember the friendship of the US quite well, while other countries have
<br>
quickly forgotten it.
