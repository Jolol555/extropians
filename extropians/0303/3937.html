From: Anders Sandberg [mailto:<a href="mailto:asa@nada.kth.se?Subject=RE:%20Mild%20psychoactive%20drugs">asa@nada.kth.se</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; I think it is a kind of &quot;black market failure&quot;. There is not much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money in manufacturing &quot;smart&quot; drugs for the current black 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market, as it is reaping huge profits from the traditional drugs 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and does not have the sales channels to the people that would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like even a black market smart drug. 
</em><br>
<p>Actually I would amend this slightly.  I think many consumers of
<br>
psychoactives would be extremely interested in smart drugs.  The
<br>
manufacturing cost for such compounds would likely be extremely low.
<br>
The large investment is in the initial identification of such a
<br>
compound.  That's where the black market falls down.  
<br>
<p>Basically every psychedelic drug that has become even slightly popular
<br>
in the last 30 years was discovered by Shulgin, who used himself and
<br>
his friends as guinea pigs.  He did this out of personal enthusiasm.
<br>
There's no market incentive in the black market to discover new drugs.
<br>
As a matter of custom, those who develop new psychedelic drugs release
<br>
their chemical structures and synthesis steps into the public domain.
<br>
Even if they didn't, there would be no effective way to protect a
<br>
patent on an illegal substance.
