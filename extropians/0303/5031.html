<p>From: &quot;Alex Future Bokov&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:alexboko@umich.edu?Subject=Re:%20WAR:%20Apparently%20the%20internet%20does%20NOT%20see%20censorship%20as%20damage%20and%20route">alexboko@umich.edu</a>&gt;
<br>
X-Mailer: YaBB
<br>
<p><p>Usually I'm pretty good at finding obscure information. So I get used to
<br>
the idea that if I need both sides of the story and spend an hour or so
<br>
googling, I'll get it. Heck, I can get the serial number to all but the most
<br>
obscure software without even having to use S2k, 0-day vulnerabilities, and
<br>
remember the big fuss about the Pentagon DNS security hole? Someone I know (a
<br>
little) found the relevant pages in about 1.5 hours despite Google pulling the
<br>
cache. Now that's all information that's officially *supposed* to be secret.
<br>
<p>Naturally, hearing the news about the POWs I was curious to see the footage
<br>
that all the fuss was about. I'm a big boy, I can handle it. Guess what? I
<br>
can't find it! Anyplace. Not mirrored, nothing. I tried Al-Jazeera...
<br>
<p>Neither aljazeera.net nor al-jazeera.net are answering pings.
<br>
<p>The traceroute to aljazeera.net deadends here from where I tried it:          
<br>
P6-0.ncnic202.Nice.francetelecom.net (193.252.101.161)                        
<br>
<p>The traceroute to al-jazeera.net deadends here:                               
<br>
63.168.12.164 (63.168.12.164)                                                 
<br>
<p>WTF?
<br>
<p>In my ongoing Google attempts, I found this:
<br>
<p><a href="http://yellowtimes.org/article.php?sid=1206">http://yellowtimes.org/article.php?sid=1206</a>
<br>
<p><p>Eliezer, could it be that you were wrong about there not being anything that
<br>
isn't Googleable? Could it be that we were all wrong about the degree to which
<br>
modern communication technology is resistant to centralized control?
<br>
<p>Has ANYBODY succeeded in getting either stills or video of the POW broadcast
<br>
aired by the enemy TV network? Perhaps someone outside the US borders? Please
<br>
let the list know if you have and where you found it. Please let the list
<br>
know also if you've had any firsthand knowledge of how this blackout is being
<br>
conducted and how far it extends. The fact that a media blackout of this data
<br>
exists is ominous. The fact that the blackout itself is all but invisible as a
<br>
news item is even more ominous. It's imperative that we map out the borders of
<br>
this data hole, and route around it. None of us can route around it, that is
<br>
important information as well-- it proves that the internet is a medium that
<br>
can be controlled.
<br>
<p>For the record, nobody on either side has claimed that information in this
<br>
broadcast can compromise national security. Even if it could, how much worse
<br>
can it be? Hundreds of thousands of the wrong people have already seen
<br>
it by now... can't we be trusted with information that our enemies have
<br>
ALREADY seen? Nor is this a hawk/dove issue. It's a free speech issue and
<br>
affects those of use who use the 'net more directly than the goings-on in a
<br>
dictatorship halfway around the world.
