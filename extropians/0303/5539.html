Ah, my extropian droogies. Let us viddy this paper that has the possibility  
<br>
of tolchoking our OPEC prestoopniks. (Why I am typing in teen-speak, I have 
<br>
no idea, since this is a serious article.)  It is a horrorshow of an article 
<br>
that sends the red krovy, all rising in me vains.  Ok, enuf Clockwork Orange 
<br>
shit. This article seems to kick the Hubert's Peak  predictions regarding 
<br>
petroleum, in the cajones. Or at the least, forstalls a petroleum drought for 
<br>
a few years. Read on.

<p><p>Tens Of Billions Of Additional Barrels Of Oil Remain To Be Tapped Miles Below
<br>
Gulf Of Mexico, Cornell Geologist Says
<br>
NEW ORLEANS -- U.S. reliance on foreign oil production could be reduced by
<br>
chemically mapping the subsurface streams of hydrocarbons, amounting to tens 
<br>
of
<br>
billions of barrels, hidden well below the Gulf of Mexico, says a Cornell
<br>
University geologist.
<br>
<p>These untapped oil and gas reserves can be found by matching hydrocarbon
<br>
chemical signatures with geologic models for stratigraphic layers under the 
<br>
sea
<br>
floor, says Lawrence M. Cathles, a professor of chemical geology at Cornell 
<br>
in
<br>
Ithaca, N.Y. &quot;The undiscovered gas and oil potential of the Gulf of Mexico is 
<br>
very large,&quot;says Cathles. &quot;We have produced only a small fraction, and the 
<br>
deep-water
<br>
potential for finding more there is big. In terms of potential, it is bigger
<br>
than the North Sea. It's about a big a deal as there is.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Cathles will present his findings in a talk, &quot;Massive Hydrocarbon Venting 
<br>
with
<br>
Minor, Constantly Replenished (Flow-Through) Retention in a 100 x 200 km Area
<br>
Offshore Louisiana Gulf of Mexico,&quot; at the 225th national meeting of the
<br>
American Chemical Society in New Orleans at 1:30 p.m. CST on March 27. 
<br>
The northern Gulf of Mexico basin is one of the world's most active areas of
<br>
hydrocarbon exploration. A study of an area of about 9,500 square miles, 
<br>
found
<br>
that hydrocarbons currently are being naturally generated from strata 
<br>
deposited
<br>
during the Tertiary and Jurassic periods, miles below the sea floor.
<br>
<p>Hydrocarbons are leaking through natural vents at hundreds of locations, and
<br>
these vent sites have been visited and studied by Cathles and other 
<br>
researchers
<br>
using small submarines. What makes this area offshore of Louisiana important 
<br>
is
<br>
the presence of two types of hydrocarbon deep below the gulf floor: the 
<br>
deeper,
<br>
early-maturing Jurassic and the later-maturing Tertiary. Each has a 
<br>
distinctive
<br>
chemistry. As these sources mature, the hydrocarbons migrate upward toward 
<br>
the
<br>
surface through what can be thought of as a myriad of small streams and 
<br>
ponds,
<br>
much like a natural water system. Just how much liquid hydrocarbon is 
<br>
retained
<br>
within this subsurface network is a matter of crucial interest, Cathles says. 
<br>
<p><p>More than 70 percent of the hydrocarbons that have been naturally generated 
<br>
have
<br>
made their way upward through the vast network of streams and ponds and 
<br>
vented
<br>
into the ocean. The hydrocarbons are digested by bacteria, which then become
<br>
food for the gulf's marine life. The earlier-generated, sulfur-rich,
<br>
carbonate-sourced Jurassic hydrocarbons are replaced by the shallower,
<br>
later-generated, shale-sourced Tertiary hydrocarbons which fill the producing
<br>
reservoirs in the northern part of the study area. This displacement of 
<br>
Jurassic
<br>
by Tertiary oil provides geologists with a measure of the remaining untapped 
<br>
oil
<br>
and gas below the gulf's floor. 
<br>
<p>The hydrocarbons hidden within the subsurface ponds and streams are about 8 
<br>
to
<br>
10 percent of the Gulf of Mexico's total hydrocarbons. In the study area this
<br>
represents about 60 billion barrels of oil and 370 trillion cubic feet of gas
<br>
and is the hydrocarbon that could be extracted, Cathles says. (The remaining
<br>
hydrocarbons, about 20 percent, stay stored in the source strata.) 
<br>
Cathles says that the telltale chemistry of the hydrocarbons reflects the
<br>
streams and ponds through which they migrated, and thus could point to the 
<br>
ponds
<br>
that remain to be discovered and produced. 
<br>
<p>Ultimately he hopes that looking at the hydrocarbon chemistry in this new way 
<br>
could provide geologists with accurate information on the presence and size 
<br>
of the deeper reservoirs. He says: &quot;By combining chemical data from currently 
<br>
producing reservoirs with seismic images of the subsurface using computer 
<br>
migration models, drilling for new deep reservoirs can be facilitated.&quot;
<br>
Funding for the research was provided by the Gas Research Institute in a 
<br>
joint
<br>
project with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution
