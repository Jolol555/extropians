<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20Iraq:Re:%20Join%20the%20not-knowers,%20was%20RE:%20Giant%20anti-war%20demonstration%20in%20Melbourne">samantha@objectent.com</a> writes in answer to Russell: I am having trouble 
<br>
understanding why you do not already have more than enough information about 
<br>
the processes so far and the stated objectives to cleanly judge whether this 
<br>
call to war is reasonable or not
<br>
<p>Russell,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing we have to realize is that this is not analogous to 
<br>
those times in history when countries have gone to war against each other.  
<br>
This is analogous to historic occasions when nations have had to send their 
<br>
armies or navies in some combination to clean out a nest of pirates.  In the 
<br>
early days of our country this happened regularly in the Caribbean Islands.  
<br>
The pirates would overwhelm an island or a government.  Then it was necessary 
<br>
for some combination of nations to clean them out and give the area back to 
<br>
the honest inhabitants.  That is all that is going on today.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no national glory to be gained, there is no loot or territory 
<br>
to be gotten.  Perhaps we will reward individuals for fighting bravely but 
<br>
that is all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Inevitably we will be surprised by some protesters that were secretly 
<br>
in league or in sympathy with the pirates but that memory will soon pass.  
<br>
All in all it is like healing a boil.  You lance it, you clean out the 
<br>
corruption and the healing begins.  The first thing you know the boil has 
<br>
completely healed and the incident is forgotten.
<br>
