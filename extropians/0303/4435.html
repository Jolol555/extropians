Humania, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wrote asking Samantha, &quot;Would you be so kind as to quote the 
<br>
relevant sections of the law allowing the powers that you list above?&quot;  It 
<br>
would have been nice to have heard from Samantha on this issue.  I would then 
<br>
have known that I was reading the material that she had taken as the basis 
<br>
for her comments.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you answered with the following: &quot;Ron, your paranoid political 
<br>
leaders did not only turn French Fries into Freedom Fries - which in itself 
<br>
is kindergarten level -- but they are going to exchange your freedom for a 
<br>
shaky security in a future police state.
<br>
Turn to the following URL where Patriot Act II is thoroughly explained:
<br>
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=11835&amp;c=206">http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=11835&amp;c=206</a><br>
<p>Now the section &quot;Ron, your paranoid political leaders did not only turn 
<br>
French Fries into Freedom Fries - which in itself is kindergarten level -- 
<br>
but they are going to exchange your freedom for a shaky security in a future 
<br>
police state&quot; IMHO is pure partisan political writing and I will dismiss it 
<br>
out of hand.
<br>
<p>But the section, &quot;Turn to the following URL where Patriot Act II is 
<br>
thoroughly explained:
<br>
<a href="http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=11835&amp;c=206">http://www.aclu.org/SafeandFree/SafeandFree.cfm?ID=11835&amp;c=206</a>pears to be 
<br>
responsive to my question, assuming that it is the answer that Samantha would 
<br>
have given.  Until Samantha answers we will never know.  Lets see what it 
<br>
says.
<br>
<p>The document under discussion says: &quot;Interested Persons Memo: 
<br>
Section-by-Section Analysis of Justice Department draft “Domestic Security 
<br>
Enhancement Act of 2003,” also known as “PATRIOT Act II”&quot;
<br>
<p>Humania you have just given us an ACLU commentary on a piece of writing that 
<br>
the ACLU says is a legislative draft by the Justice Department of the United 
<br>
States Government for something called the PATRIOT Act II.  There isn't even 
<br>
a copy of the original, nor is there any indication as to who the writer was.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't know what country you are from but many of our list members 
<br>
are from outside the US so let me expand on what we are looking at.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many pieces of &quot;draft legislation&quot; float around Washington, DC all the 
<br>
time.  Some are more authoritative than others.  I see no reason to question 
<br>
the ACLUs motives, they state them at the head of this piece of writing, they 
<br>
are drumming up new members.  Still they will not get embarrassingly off the 
<br>
mark.  After all they want to win members not to be laughed at.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someday possibly some person or persons that thinks the ideas 
<br>
contained in this &quot;draft legislation&quot; might decide it will make a good law.  
<br>
They may or may not rewrite it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the system we use in passing laws two sponsors for the proposed 
<br>
law will be found, one Republican and one Democrat.  The Republicans name 
<br>
will be listed first as the Republicans control congress.  The bill will be 
<br>
placed in the hopper and in due course it will go in front of one or more 
<br>
committees in both the House of Representatives and in the U. S. Senate.  The 
<br>
committees will discuss the bill.  Perhaps, in fact almost certainly, the 
<br>
bill will get rewritten to contain some unknown changes.  When all the 
<br>
committees in each house finally agree the bill probably be reported to the 
<br>
entire body.  Some bills die in committee so that is not a guarantee.  The 
<br>
bill will be debated on the floor of the House or Senate and if passed (that 
<br>
is no guarentee either) it will be a committee made up of members from the 
<br>
House and the Senate.  The Joint Committee will reconcile the two versions of 
<br>
the bill if differences exist.  That will be done in accordance political 
<br>
bargaining between the House and Senate.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reconciled bill will be returned for further debate, changes and 
<br>
voting.  Eventually the bill will be voted up or down.  If the bill is passed 
<br>
it will go to our President for his consideration.  He may accept the bill 
<br>
and sign it or he may veto the bill.  He may call in the concerned members of 
<br>
Congress and discuss the bill.  From here we may or may not get another round 
<br>
of writing, horse trading and voting.  But even at this point we are not sure 
<br>
we will ever pass this law.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do think we must be careful not to use intemperate language on 
<br>
subjects such as this:
<br>
First, as Americans we can scare the dickens out of foreign members that 
<br>
don't understand the American legislative system.  Some people possibly won't 
<br>
know an American law from something that is less solid than a pipe dream.  
<br>
Let me give two quick examples.  I think Harry S Truman first tried to pass 
<br>
Universal Medical Care in the nineteen forties.  The thing has hung around 
<br>
every since, being proposed, discussed and then voted down for the time 
<br>
being.  Dick Nixon proposed a Guaranteed Annual Wage in the early 70s.  Both 
<br>
are still around, neither is law nor likely to be very soon.
<br>
Second, as Extropians laws similar to Patriots Act II covers material that is 
<br>
of deep concern to us whether we are from the left or from the right.  Using 
<br>
language that splits our group only weakens us and makes it easier for 
<br>
someone to actually pass such a monstrosity.
<br>
