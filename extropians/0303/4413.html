<em>&gt; Subject: World of Knights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I read something the other day that got me thinking about what the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be like if everyone were honest.  By honest I mean mostly that when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they give their word, they feel bound to keep it.  It would also mean that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would tell the truth and not lie.  To some extent the situation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Wright's The Golden Age had some properties like this: although people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could lie, they had the ability to tell the truth in a verifiable way, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letting the machines read their mind.  And as it was a pure libertarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world, everyone seemed to feel very much bound by contracts that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had agreed to.  I think maybe the machines enforced that.
</em><br>
<p>You don't need machines to enforce that. In contractual, low-cost
<br>
publication world, you very publically stop being contract-worthy if you
<br>
mess with people. You aren't invited to parties. You become a social
<br>
outcast, you can't garner whatever resouce it is that you need to make
<br>
contracts to acquire. Your very ability to live the way you want within the
<br>
society is diminished by your actions.
<br>
<p>The only reason this isn't true now is inefficient publication and lookup of
<br>
reputation.
