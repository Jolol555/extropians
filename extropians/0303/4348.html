<p><em>&gt; Well, there's an interesting discussion right now on /. about office 11

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; DRM is gonna intersect with Office 11 XML, seems to me if it's XML how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can there be DRM?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know much about the details of Office 11 and Microsoft's plans
<br>
for digital rights management.  But certainly there is no contradiction
<br>
between using XML and keeping data protected.  There is for example an
<br>
XML data encryption standard, in fact I am working on implementing that
<br>
right now.
<br>
<p>I do find a lot of the MS-bashing rhetoric to be quite confused.
<br>
Some say that MS is going to lock in all its customers and force them
<br>
to keep upgrading or else cause all their old software to stop working.
<br>
Then they realize that the customers wouldn't stand for this and so they
<br>
say that MS is doomed.  Nobody seems to appreciate the effects of feedback
<br>
and moderation.  Everything is cast in extremes.  The sky is falling,
<br>
and we're doomed.  No, they're doomed.  Well, somebody's doomed, anyway.
