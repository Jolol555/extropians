<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;The USA will be acting against international law and YOU KNOW IT.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that's exactly the problem, many of us don't know it. You claim to
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; that knowledge so tell us, exactly what &quot;international law&quot; did the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violate, what are the penalties for transgressors, how are they enforced,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where are they written down, where can I see the signature of the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreeing to these regulations,
</em><br>
<p>The international law (German: Voelkerrecht = people's law) Bush is now
<br>
acting against is written down in the charta of the United Nations. And I do
<br>
remember that the USA signed at least *this* treaty. And therein it is
<br>
stated that a preemptive war is against international law if it is not
<br>
approved by the security council of the UN. The conditions for the council
<br>
to approve of a preemptive war are very restricted, and so far no sane envoy
<br>
is willing to see such conditions to agree with the US viewpoint that they
<br>
are so deadly threatened by Saddam that they would have to stop him before
<br>
he pushes the button.
<br>
<p>Now, the UN has not approved of a preemptive war, so Bush is acting against
<br>
international law. He doesn`t give a shit about the rest of the world. Maybe
<br>
you should really start turning to European news sources from now on. At
<br>
least here in Germany we can read the statements of all dominant governments
<br>
in the world who condemn Bushs announcement of his solo effort last night
<br>
and his violation of international law. Even the German Christian
<br>
conservative party, for almost 60 years now on excellent terms with every
<br>
US administration, is somehow shocked about the way Bush disregards the
<br>
UN security council.
<br>
<p>Nobody will officially punish the US for this transgressing. So you don't
<br>
need to worry :-) but your country has lost friends by the dozens.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and most important of all is there any reason
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US citizens should bet their lives that this mysterious fuzzy thing called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;international law&quot; will protect them from another 911 type attack?
</em><br>
Sorry
<br>
<em>&gt; for all the questions, I've asked them before but nobody had an answer. Do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>John, there IS no protection. You must protect yourself. You have to choose
<br>
between a deadly cold &quot;security&quot; in a police state where everybody spies on
<br>
everybody else or you accept that you can die any moment. How in the world
<br>
can anybody ever prevent a team of determined mindfuckers to blow another
<br>
skyscraper in Washington, Paris or Berlin? And if I happen to be in this
<br>
Berlin building at the wrong time, I am fucking unlucky. That's all.
<br>
<p>You have to live with the rest risk. You have to loose your fear and your
<br>
desire for revenge somehow. Nobody can protect you against terrorism.One
<br>
preemptive war after the other will suck your economy dry and the further
<br>
downfall of the USA is ensured.
