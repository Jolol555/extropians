<p>Please expound on these supposed social needs that you imply are 
<br>
contrary to individual rights and perhaps supersede them.

<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I thought it was our goal to create a world or pockets therein 
<br>
of maximum extropy.  I don't see how those pockets can be 
<br>
created without maximizing freedom and individual rights.  What 
<br>
does acceptance have to do with this?  I don't see that as 
<br>
orthogonal or contrary.  I don't know where reaction such as &quot;I 
<br>
am right and you are wrong&quot; comes into the general statement you 
<br>
are making.  What do you mean by &quot;accept all of society&quot; more 
<br>
precisely?
