In two posts on March 13, Steve Davies writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Imperialism means a bit more than [taking of someone else's land].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Obviously, the core aspect is one nation or state ruling over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; territory not its own original territory and (the really important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part) the people who inhabit that territory.  It's the rule of one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people over another that makes a state an empire.
</em><br>
<p>[Ron and I asked &quot;What is 'liberal imperialism'?&quot;]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You need to forget about the unique American use of the word 'liberal' to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean 'socialist' - this makes political conversation between Americans (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Canadians) and people from other parts of the world unnecessarily difficult.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Liberal imperialism&quot; is originally a term used by historians to describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the kind of 'New Imperialism' that appeared after the Berlin Conference of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1878, to some extent in reality, much more in theory. By extension it means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a policy motivated or justified by the same kinds of ideas.  That is, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; notion that imperialism is not about simply conquering other peoples for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth, power, or glory.  It is about advanced or civilised nations ruling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over other (not so advanced) nations so as to bring them the benefits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law, modernity...
</em><br>
<p>Yet in all the cases I can think of from 1878 on, European powers
<br>
ruled over others' lands for the primary purpose of enriching 
<br>
themselves (i.e. economic advance), or for military gain (e.g.,
<br>
the conquest of the Turkish possessions).  I would be willing to admit
<br>
that a secondary consideration might be the welfare of the ruled,
<br>
at least after, as you suggest, 1878.
<br>
<p>Probably in the minds of the American leaders, benefit to the 
<br>
people of Iraq is one of the motives, but probably no higher
<br>
than about 3rd or 4th.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An important point is that you may not need to directly rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over land/people de jure if your power is such that you effectively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control it anyway e.g. British rule over about half of India plus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places like Argentina.  I'm afraid that while the US avoided that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until the 1890s it caught a bad case after then, viz Hawaii, Puerto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rico, the Philippines.  The policy followed in the Middle East
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after [this new] war will tell us if it has embarked on another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; round of imperialism.
</em><br>
<p>Then the irony is, the more effort that is made on behalf of
<br>
the Iraqi people, then the more imperialistic the U.S. role
<br>
will become!  For example, suppose (as I have just said) that
<br>
there are two reasons that come before benefiting the Iraqi
<br>
people.  For the purpose of discussion, let's assume that they
<br>
are (i) ridding Iraq of WMD, (ii) stabilizing the price of oil.
<br>
Then a possible (iii) establishing a non-authoritarian or less
<br>
repressive regime in Iraq  would require an extended stay by
<br>
the Coalition (or at least U.S.) forces.  But the longer the
<br>
stay, the more this is a case of liberal imperialism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In other words to rule over other people for their own good,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a kind of tutelary role.  Basically it's a Fabian welfare
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state but on an international level (one reason why most Fabians
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were ardent Imperialists).  It seems to me that this kind of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking is a major element in much argument about a war on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq, e.g. the idea that the US will reconstruct Iraq in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way it (allegedly) did in Germany and Japan after 1945.
</em><br>
<p>The tutelary role the Fabians probably had in mind would
<br>
have extended indefinitely, no?  (After all, it was widely
<br>
supposed at the time that non-Western peoples couldn't
<br>
really rule themselves on our level.)
<br>
<p>As for Germany and Japan, it's become clear that the occupying
<br>
countries needed only &quot;flip a switch&quot;.  The Germans and Japanese
<br>
rather easily converted into stalwart democracies.  We cannot
<br>
expect most Middle Eastern countries to do so, not at least without
<br>
a rather long period of &quot;tutelage&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The faction in Washington [Wolfowitz, etc.] are arguing, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I understand them, that the unique position of power the US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found itself in at the end of the Cold War gives it the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity and the responsibility to shape the world in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way that both protects US interests and security and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advances certain political ideals.  Sounds a lot like liberal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperialism to me, could come straight out of late nineteenth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century British imperialist writings of the Cecil Rhodes variety.
</em><br>
<p>Really?  As I said, the 19th century thinkers did *not* have any
<br>
intention of bringing up the White Man's burden to the White Man's
<br>
level now, did they?  I gather that the English really and 
<br>
sincerely were trying to do this in India, but only, I think, 
<br>
well into the 1920's.  Don't you think that if Rhodes and
<br>
all actually wrote this that they didn't quite mean it the
<br>
way that we would today?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is very much where Tony Blair and his advisors are coming from.
</em><br>
<p>So in your opinion, they're not in advance of the late 19th
<br>
century imperialists?
<br>
<p>Above you wrote
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The policy followed in the Middle East after [this new] war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will tell us if it has embarked on another round of imperialism.
</em><br>
<p>What are your criteria, more specifically?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
