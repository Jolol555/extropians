<br>
It's like mafia wars.  In the first season's episodes (Gulf War #1), Saddam 
<br>
tried to hire someone to whack Bush Sr.   Now we're in the second season's 
<br>
episodes (Gulf War #2). Bush Jr. is really, really mad that Saddam tried to 
<br>
whack his dad in the last season's episodes, so he's going to whack Saddam. 
<br>
<p>GTS,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I correct that you consider this sequence of events as lamentable 
<br>
-- that is to say that Bush Jr. should not retaliate against Sadaam Hussein 
<br>
because he tried to kill Bush Sr.?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Search my memory as I might I cannot remember the Iraqis trying to 
<br>
&quot;whack&quot; Bush Sr.  But if that happened I assume it happened on Bill Clinton's 
<br>
watch.  What I want to know is this: why can a foreign government or ruler 
<br>
decide to &quot;whack&quot; an American citizen without Bill Clinton reacting 
<br>
vigorously?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember that British Intelligence went to Franklin Roosevelt for 
<br>
permission to &quot;Whack&quot; an American citizen before the Second World War.  The 
<br>
American was apparently spying for the Germans and was costing the British 
<br>
ships as well as British lives.  At that time allowing a foreign country to 
<br>
kill an American was pure political poison.  Roosevelt in his wisdom didn't 
<br>
allow the British to do that.  The man died at someone's hands so the problem 
<br>
disappeared.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Roosevelt would not permit allow a foreign friend to kill an 
<br>
ordinary American Citizen guilty of spying against a friend why would you and 
<br>
Ex-President Clinton allow a foreign enemy to kill one of our Ex-Presidents?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GTS, no country worthy of its salt allows its citizenry to be killed 
<br>
by a foreign power so why was it okay for Sadaam to attempt to kill Bush Sr., 
<br>
if that is true?
<br>
