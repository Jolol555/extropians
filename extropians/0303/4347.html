<em>&gt;One of the problems with homesteading in the United States was an instance
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of what is called rent-seeking.  Settlers would occupy land prematurely,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;before it was economically ripe to do so.  They would live on the land
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at a loss for a number of years in the expectation that as civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;developed in the area, the land would eventually become valuable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But all those years of losses were wasted economic effort that could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been put to better use.  In fact the waste can be so great as to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;dissipate all the future value of the land.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This is well understood as a theory, but is there much evidence that it
<br>
has happened with land? De Soto (in The Mystery of Capitalism) claims
<br>
that homesteading laws generally recognized the claims of people who
<br>
had been living on the land, and provided much less opportunity for
<br>
new settlements that is commonly claimed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Patents might see some of the same problem - people rush to get patents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;even when they don't make that much economic sense.  The limited term
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of patents will help to avoid waste, but some still does occur.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This might be a problem in a few areas, such as patents on genes, but
<br>
it's hard to see signs that this is a widespread problem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think another of the big problems with patents is that most are not well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;managed.  The transaction costs to negotiate a license are extremely high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How many here who have faced a problem due to a patent have seriously
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considered trying to negotiate a license?  Each such failure is a lost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunity for the patent holder.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This is a much bigger problem. I think many of the problems are inherent
<br>
in negotiations involving a monopoly, unless there are a large number of
<br>
customers (see <a href="http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Bilateral_Monopoly_%C4/Bilateral_Monopoly.html">http://www.daviddfriedman.com/Academic/Bilateral_Monopoly_%C4/Bilateral_Monopoly.html</a>
<br>
for an explanation of some of the problems).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I foresee a day when every patent will have a link you can click on to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;license it.  As the internet works to drive down transaction costs in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;all other areas, it will facilitate patent licensing as well.  This might
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;This might work well in a few areas where work well, but it requires that
<br>
there be a well-defined quantity being licensed. A drug company might
<br>
license the right to manufacture X molecules of a drug, with only some
<br>
enforcement problems (which I suspect are big enough to make many drug
<br>
companies unwilling to sell licenses at a reasonable price). But what is
<br>
the unit of use being sold when Barnes &amp; Noble wants the one-click patent?
<br>
What about when I want permission to use the RSA patent in a program I'm
<br>
going to release under an open source license? What about an algorithm
<br>
I'm going to use once in a key step while developing a program that passes
<br>
the Turing test, but I can then make billions off of the program without
<br>
any further need to infringe on the patent? Or what if I think there's
<br>
a 1% chance that the algorithm will allow me to develop such a program,
<br>
and the patent holder developed the algorithm in order to make money off
<br>
of AI programs? Is the patent holder going to believe my 1% estimate for
<br>
my chances of success, or will he set his price based on his own estimate
<br>
and ignore the chance that he could make a few million by pricing it so
<br>
that someone with my assumptions will buy it?
<br>
&nbsp;I first ran across a minor version of this problem while working for
<br>
a company that made vibration control systems that included a computer.
<br>
The competitor who owned some relevant patents sold systems with a
<br>
dedicated computer built into the hardware. We allowed our customers to
<br>
buy our system without a computer and supply their own PC. This led to
<br>
some disputes over what the total sales price used in computing the
<br>
royalties should be.
