<em>&gt; &gt;Can't agree.  No one &quot;taught&quot; the Americans anything.  And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;you cannot say it has become their Nature because dissent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is too widespread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that the real argument is with the development of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the human mind.  I don't think that genetic disposition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matters when it comes to most memes.
</em><br>
<p>Okay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would go so far as to say that the mind learns almost all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unchangeable dispositions from the enviroment.  In that way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human nature as we see it wrong.
</em><br>
<p>These two sentences are enormously vague and ambiguous.  You
<br>
don't support your sentences with examples, and there is almost
<br>
no redundancy.  Hence, you could be talking about almost anything.
<br>
<p>I finally caught on to this when I realized how long it was 
<br>
taking me to respond to your post last night.  The reason was
<br>
that I was having to get very creative attempting to divine
<br>
what you meant.  Not too surprisingly, I may have ended up
<br>
talking to myself more than to you.
<br>
<p>What would be some examples of &quot;unchangeable dispositions&quot;?
<br>
You probably know what you mean, but how is the reader supposed
<br>
to know?  The last sentence doesn't even parse!
<br>
<p>Take an entire paragraph for a thought; not just one sentence.
<br>
After you've written a sentence, look at it critically and
<br>
see if it's at all possible for someone to misinterpret it.
<br>
Even if it doesn't seem possible, you might take another
<br>
sentence and make it say exactly the same thing, only using
<br>
different words---your reader will be grateful because then
<br>
your reader knows for sure that he understands.
<br>
<p>Observe when I wrote above &quot;Hence, you could be talking about
<br>
almost anything&quot;.  See how redundant that is?  It hardly says
<br>
anything that the previous sentence did not, and so reinforces
<br>
that thought and removes possible ambiguity.
<br>
<p>I dunno; I'm no expert.  But I think that the topic sentence
<br>
(the one that the paragraph starts with) is supposed to
<br>
forcefully lay out your main point.  The rest of the paragraph
<br>
is clarification and buttressing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would even go farther to say that these learned systems are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; essential for a funtioning human being.  This of course would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be hard to prove.
</em><br>
<p>What learned systems are how essential for human beings?
<br>
You could be talking about language, or you could be talking
<br>
about learning to relate to others, etc.
<br>
<p>Also, does your emailer have a spell-checker?  8^D
<br>
<p>Would you mind re-writing this post?  It sounds very 
<br>
interesting.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee

<p><em>&gt; One would need to raise a human by machine since it's conception 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside a vacuum.  I am not saying that we are a blank slate.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am saying that our real nature has the ablity to be much more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diverse than the one we have learned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All memes must follow genetic paths of language. I do not see why this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process would evolve more control when the control is already present in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enviroment. People should realize that this enviroment of learning plays as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; great a part as does genetics. I wonder if one could calculate the time it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would take for a human to evolve without this learning. Although such a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creature would lose the flexability humans have now. It would still be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting to find that humans would have taken X billions years to reach 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this piont given an enviroment where that human would perfectly fit (it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theoretical of course). Then a measurment could be compared to how long it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has taken us thus far. The suprising thing would be if the theoretical human 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would take more than double the time a normal human took to evolve. Then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some would say that the &quot;enviromental evolution&quot; plays a larger part than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If anyone has any sources on this let me know. Thanks Nate
