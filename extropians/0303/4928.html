</em><br>
<p>PPOs without mutual defense contracts would likely be more expensive, not
<br>
cheaper.  After all, mutual defense contracts will make active defense less
<br>
commonly needed, thus saving money.  Further, the more PPOs joined such
<br>
agreements, the more criminals would tend to prey on those who used PPOs
<br>
without such agreements.  I'm actually not sure why you believe PPOs with
<br>
mutual defense contracts would be more expensive, anyway?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; pass the names of individuals without PPO contracts to criminals (who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would gleefully prey on them, discouraging from free-riding). As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result you would still have the competition that makes capitalism work,
</em><br>
<p>Wouldn't it make more sense for them to publish a list of those who had
<br>
contracts with them, instead (subject to the customer's willingness to be
<br>
on such a list, of course)?  After all, how could they be sure that some
<br>
individual doesn't have a PPO contract with someone, somewhere?
<br>
<p>In fact, they already do this, to some degree; one often sees &quot;Protected by
<br>
ADT&quot; stickers on houses, etc.  Someone whose auto or house doesn't
<br>
have such a sticker (perhaps with a difficult-to-counterfeit RFID chip) might
<br>
be assumed not to have a PPO, and thus be a free rider (or eager for a fight).
