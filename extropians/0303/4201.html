<p><em>&gt; Since the Feds can now snoop into U.S citizen's reading habits,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suggest not to use libraries for your reading material. You might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to think twice about bookstore purchases too.
</em><br>
<p>and Mike writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anybody who relies on the nationalized banking system (i.e. credit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cards) gets what they deserve.  Pay cash for your purchases...
</em><br>
<p>My instincts have always been too trusting.  Time and again
<br>
I have always assumed the authorities would act in a manner
<br>
somewhat like how I would act in their position.  I have always
<br>
felt something in common with the Russian people or German 
<br>
people in just assuming &quot;the authorities&quot; knew what they were
<br>
doing.  I've even always had nearly unquestioned faith in the
<br>
people I've worked for---and not once, by the way, has this
<br>
confidence been betrayed.
<br>
<p>Due to this limitation, this blind spot, I can only engage a
<br>
very rational portion of my cognitive powers when attempting
<br>
to assess danger from the government.  Of course, I did finally
<br>
become a libertarian, though it took decades, and then it did
<br>
become possible to perceive the tremendously inimical effects
<br>
of a bloated bureaucracy and stifling laws.
<br>
<p>But these effects from the State of California and from the 
<br>
Federal Government always felt more like a bumbling intent
<br>
to do good, rather than malevolence.  I'm threatened with high
<br>
taxes, when you come right down to it, and little more (except
<br>
a lot of little nuisance laws).
<br>
<p>The heart leads the mind, and so it is only with great difficulty
<br>
even now that I perceive a valid threat to American liberties.
<br>
Do I make the additional mistake of having too thoroughly studied
<br>
true despotisms and totalitarianism, and so just consider myself
<br>
lucky to be able to say virtually anything I please and go anywhere
<br>
I want?
<br>
<p>Do Mike and the others really expect a knock on the door---or worse,
<br>
the door being violently broken in---someday soon when &quot;they&quot; have
<br>
taken over?  Why is my name in credit card databases any kind of
<br>
threat to me?  My name is on public record in a number of places
<br>
in California; the county land records, the state income tax board,
<br>
the Department of Motor Vehicles.  I don't feel threatened.
<br>
Should I?
<br>
<p>Some people who can't think clearly at all and have no sense of
<br>
perspective already consider the U.S. the most repressive tyranny
<br>
in history, the worst imperialist power, and the genocide champion
<br>
of all time.  So forgetting about them, who else thinks that there
<br>
is a significant chance that the U.S. will become as repressive
<br>
as China currently is, or Spain under Franco?
<br>
<p>(Remember the astonishment of the Soviet visitor to Spain in the
<br>
1960's when he saw a photocopier in plain sight inside a Madrid
<br>
office building?  Such, of course, was absolutely impossible in
<br>
the U.S.S.R., so I'm not asking about the U.S. going Nazi or
<br>
Stalinist---I'm just asking about something relatively mild.)
<br>
<p>Do you expect things to get worse and worse and worse?  Do you
<br>
foresee Ashcroft and those like him arresting people for political
<br>
dissent, censoring radio and television?
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>
Lee
