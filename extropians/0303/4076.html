<p>Thanks for posting forwarding this.  It is really very chilling. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This stuff really makes me sad.  This did not have to be. 
<br>
Our governments and our corporations have sucked us dry and call 
<br>
for ever more.  Yet, under the current mindset, the basic 
<br>
assumptions most people operate by, this sort of development 
<br>
really was to be expected.  So many trillions of dollars just 
<br>
went &lt;poof&gt;.  With the means to make them real gone, so many 
<br>
dreams are being stillborn.
<br>
<p>Out of these same fundamental assumptions the US government 
<br>
thinks it is supposed to go in for Imperialism.  Actually, even 
<br>
those assumptions don't justify what it is contemplating and in 
<br>
the process of doing now.  It is so unbelievably crass and evil 
<br>
that even very far-out explanations like our policy being set by 
<br>
those who have in mind to start Armageddon seem almost 
<br>
reasonable.  I look at what is happening and it seems certain 
<br>
that our President and sibling goons are bound and determined to 
<br>
tip the world into chaos and much greater fear.  Why?   What do 
<br>
they hope to get out of it?  An excuse for even worse against 
<br>
both the American people and the rest of the world?  It is 
<br>
becoming difficult to believe there is any sane explantion.
<br>
<p>A friend of mine at work who spent some years in Germany was 
<br>
telling me that his European friends and contacts generally have 
<br>
much more an anti-American sentiment, a very great anger toward 
<br>
and fear of what the US is doing and might do, than he has ever 
<br>
seen before.  If even first-world allies feel this way then what 
<br>
kind of witch's brew are we concocting for ourselves?
<br>
<p>One reason for the current policies (or rather a possible excuse 
<br>
for why these are the policies) is that Bush &amp; company believe 
<br>
they can escape the massive economic woes by somehow stimulating 
<br>
the economy through war, or at least that they can get maximal 
<br>
control handed to them that way.  Of course that is tremendously 
<br>
short-sighted.  Much cheaper measures (and much more moral) at 
<br>
the beginning of the financial downturn would have helped 
<br>
tremendously, especially to keep the US tech sector where most 
<br>
of the growth was (and potentially still is) more intact. 
<br>
Instead nearly two thirds of the tech people I know, highly 
<br>
trained and proficient tech people, are out of work and have 
<br>
been for quite some time.   This is a travesty and it is a 
<br>
direct body blow to our &gt;human dreams and aspirations.
<br>
<p>What is being done is making America look like an international 
<br>
bully, a great idiotic destructive lout.  This is very, very 
<br>
dangerous and greatly harms everyone.
<br>
<p>Why on earth is computer and copyright theft such a central 
<br>
issue?  That is very small potatoes in a world threatened by 
<br>
unending war, economic stagnation and reaction to fear rather 
<br>
than any vision of a viable future and cooperatively making that 
<br>
future real.  Copyrights and patents as currently over-applied 
<br>
by US laws that we attempt to force on everyone else are a big 
<br>
problem in the way of a viable future and are a serious 
<br>
impediment to current well-being and development.   The 
<br>
circumventing of copyrights and patents is not what I consider 
<br>
most important about the property as applied to intellectual 
<br>
creations.  But again, this is a very small part, one among many 
<br>
symptoms, of the current crisis.
<br>
<p>The comment from American security and military folks about 
<br>
preemptive strikes and taking out states and fighting wars all 
<br>
over the globe to &quot;cleanse the world&quot;  is pure nutcake.  How can 
<br>
anyone take such statements as other than  a flagrant admission 
<br>
of psychotic insanity?  That they and our administration appear 
<br>
to mean it is so incredibly unbelievable that I almost doubt my 
<br>
own sanity when I am forced to see it as real.
<br>
<p>We won't get rid of terrorism by acting as terrorist states.  We 
<br>
won't end terrorism with bullets alone or even primarily.  It 
<br>
ends when everyone has a stake in the world and only the 
<br>
actually unbalanced few feel any need for such attacks.  What we 
<br>
are doing now is about as sensible as attempting to put out a 
<br>
fire with a flame-thrower.  Concentration on the fear will not 
<br>
help much either.  Fixing the real woes of the world that feed 
<br>
terrorism is very much required.  And no, this does not mean 
<br>
that &quot;the terrorists win&quot;.  It means we behave like responsible 
<br>
life-positive future-positive adults instead of warring, looting 
<br>
tribes of monkeys equipped with super-technology.
<br>
<p>If the &quot;leaders&quot; are primarily concerned with &quot;the bottom line&quot; 
<br>
and do not notice much unless it directly threatens them or the 
<br>
bottom line then it is no wonder we are in this kind of crisis.
