I appreciate the desire to look at humanitarian issues.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### One option is to set up food and other aid dispensing areas right
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; need, while denying this to the military. Young men who come for aid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not be let back into the city and would be diverted to temporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; refugee camps. Women and children returning to the city could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fingerprinted, and issued only enough food for themselves, to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transfers to the military.
</em><br>
<p>Umm, forgive me, but what stops them from getting hijacked by the first 
<br>
pair of strong arms (or AK) that crosses their path? &quot;It takes about two 
<br>
weeks to starve, as a rough rule of thumb. Be nice, keep your mouth shut 
<br>
and go back tomorrow for your next dole-out, and *maybe* we'll let you eat 
<br>
some of it.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then all you need is sit and wait, although if the Baathists decide to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; starve their own population, this could be costly to the average Iraqis.
</em><br>
<p>OK, sounds like you *are* thinking of that possibility. I consider it 
<br>
likely, if &quot;food&quot; == &quot;food provided by the Great Satan&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sooner, rather than later, the city's inhabitants would rise and get rid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of their oppressors, ending the war. There would be no Coalition losses
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and no losses inflicted by the Coalition.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps. And perhaps your diverting the young men to refugee camps would in 
<br>
part make the remaining family members even more subject to oppression over 
<br>
time, without young men in place to rebel. I can't tell if that counts as 
<br>
&quot;losses inflicted by the Coalition&quot; or not. But I guarantee that if I were 
<br>
such a young man, interned while my family suffered, I wouldn't think 
<br>
kindly of my internors. Ever.
<br>
<p>Make the women and children eat the food while they're outside? Then they 
<br>
get treated badly when they return, as &quot;examples&quot; of what happens to 
<br>
&quot;sympathizers&quot;. Forced to vomit it up, maybe, even. While being videotaped.
<br>
<p>I see no way to force _any_ Baathists to act in a humane manner short of 
<br>
direct person-on-person  intervention forcing them to restrict their 
<br>
behavior. And that's expensive and probably horrible work.
