<em>&gt; &gt; 5. Provoking threads whose entire purpose is to explain

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The amazing thing, really, is that people *care* enough to analyze your

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I, but not, say, Anders Sandberg or Damien Broderick?
</em><br>
<p>Eliezer goes on to answer this question.  Somehow, this does
<br>
not deter me from answering it myself.  :-)
<br>
<p>Well, not that it's anything to brag about, but some of us lead
<br>
with our jaws, so to speak.  There can be something not a little
<br>
confrontational about how we phrase things.  The only reason
<br>
I think that you have been less a target on this list than I
<br>
is that you are less ideological.  (In a political sense.)
<br>
<p>Now something *to* brag about is, as I was reminded by an
<br>
offline correspondent, I am number one in the race for
<br>
lowest karma.  Gloat.
<br>
<p>Moreover, that proves that I really ticked off someone politically,
<br>
because the aforementioned thread, it turned out, was powered only
<br>
by those upset with my political stance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is because they are nicer.
</em><br>
<p>That they are.  A number of times I have seen Anders say to
<br>
someone *exactly* what I would have said.  Yet it came out
<br>
much nicer.  Sometimes I could see what about it was nicer,
<br>
but at other times it was a mystery.  And I have seen Damien,
<br>
although sometimes rather mean to a newbie, will refrain from
<br>
saying what he's really thinking to someone out of courtesy,
<br>
and appears to restrain himself in other ways I can't quite
<br>
put my finger on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And possibly because you and I consciously use and *mention*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declarative principles of rationality.
</em><br>
<p>Well, you do that more than I do.  Besides, why would that
<br>
itself upset anyone?  We don't really have any anti-rationalists
<br>
I know of on this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Someday I hope to become a nice rationalist.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm already very nice---except, as I said for being
<br>
rather confrontational at times, and sometimes denouncing
<br>
nonsense rather uncompromisingly.  But I too have a rather
<br>
long ways to go to get where Anders is.
<br>
