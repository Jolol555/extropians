<p>&quot;The worrying thing is that on casual observation. If a complete loon is 
<br>
elected, you cant get rid of them until they step way-way over the line. As 
<br>
in Nixon.&quot;
<br>
<p>I often stress the need for historical perspective during my replies on this 
<br>
forum, and I dare say that has never been more appropriate than in regard to 
<br>
this post. There's nothing I enjoy better than hit and run &quot;Evil Nixon the 
<br>
mad tyrant loon harbinger of global destruction makes Hitler look like Little 
<br>
Mary Sunshine&quot; discussions. I do not mean to suggest that Alex implies all of 
<br>
those descriptions, but he obviously subscribes to a few.
<br>
<p>Before fully getting into this subject, perhaps Alex would be kind enough to 
<br>
fully elaborate on his position on the 37th President. Perhaps it is fully 
<br>
thought out, but I tend to think the influence of thirty years of &quot;impartial&quot; 
<br>
sources such as Walter Cronkite have played a role in his description of 
<br>
Nixon as a &quot;loon.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me say that the record of Richard Nixon is a complex one and cannot be 
<br>
summed up in a cute MTV style one sentence quip. It can be successfully 
<br>
argued that no post- WWII president had a more lasting and important positive 
<br>
impact on the United States than President Nixon. This is the same man who 
<br>
initiated rapprochement with the Chinese, a move that not only altered Soviet 
<br>
defense expenditures and strategy, but helped to make them the isolated 
<br>
spreader of &quot;worldwide revolution&quot;. 
<br>
<p>This is the same &quot;loon&quot; that helped save Israel from certain catastrophic 
<br>
defeat at the hands of the Arabs during the Yom Kippur War in October 1973, 
<br>
prompting then Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir to declare, &quot;God Bless 
<br>
President Nixon.&quot;
<br>
<p>This aforementioned &quot;loon&quot; also finally saw to it that the widespread 
<br>
desegregation of southern schools, 15 years after the practice had been 
<br>
formally outlawed, was finally tossed into the dustbin of history. 
<br>
<p>I could go on and on regarding the merits and accomplishments of this &quot;loon&quot; 
<br>
(and believe me, I have), but perhaps it best to wait for Alex to author his 
<br>
rebuttal. President Nixon is certainly not without his faults, but I dare say 
<br>
that not one of his subsequent successors come close to matching his 
<br>
achievements, and even fewer have any accomplishments that will be discussed 
<br>
many decades from now, as Nixon's rapprochement with the Chinese is and will 
<br>
continue to be.
<br>
<p>Regards, 
<br>
