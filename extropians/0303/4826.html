</em><br>
<em>&gt; How would you define the &quot;rules of reciprocity&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>### &quot;Action may invite a non-consensual reaction of the same kind and
<br>
magnitude&quot;. Physical force, damaging a human body, may be responded to
<br>
with physical force, damaging a human body. Conflating physical, violent
<br>
force, with &quot;economic force&quot; might imply allowing the use of
<br>
non-consensual force in response to an action that does not consist of
<br>
the use of force, e.g. a refusal to interact. Historically, acceptance
<br>
of this modus operandi on a large scale tends to result in shortened
<br>
survival and poor economic outcomes.
<br>
<p>BTW, reciprocity is a heuristic, not a moral goal in itself, and if
<br>
sufficient reasons exist, it may be waived, in the interest of survival
<br>
and economic growth (but very, very rarely).
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me a straightforward way to analyze huge numbers of economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activities as deployments of force (&quot;the capacity to do work&quot;).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moving money is work and can instigate work - whether the result is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;violent&quot; or &quot;nonviolent&quot; is an aesthetic judgment.
</em><br>
<p>### I think that many of us would agree on a more rigorous division -
<br>
roughly, &quot;violence&quot; non-consensually ends life, or causes severe and
<br>
non-consensual physical suffering. There is a bit of a gray area
<br>
regarding extreme mental suffering but for the most part it is not a
<br>
major source of misunderstanding. Therefore, money motivating a hitman
<br>
is violence, money moving a baker is not.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Paying someone to
<br>
<em>&gt; manufacture a product is parallel to paying someone to murder a person -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just different results of the exercise of force.
</em><br>
<p>### I do not understand.
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it violent
<br>
<em>&gt; to kill someone?
</em><br>
<p>### If non-consensual, yes.
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Is it violent to make them buy your product?
<br>
<p>### The construction &quot;to make somebody do something&quot; usually implies the
<br>
use a threat of violence. A thug threating you with a beating if you do
<br>
not buy a worthless trinket from him, may be threatened with violence,
<br>
by reciprocity. Sometimes, however, this expression is used differently
<br>
- e.g. if a shopkeeper will sell item A only in association with item B,
<br>
many people will say he &quot;made&quot; them buy it. In this second, sloppy
<br>
meaning, there is of course no violence or a threat of violence, and
<br>
accordingly, the buyer's reaction may not include such measures
<br>
(including the use of state-organized violence).
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Is it
<br>
<em>&gt; violent to keep them in a single area?
</em><br>
<p>### Do you mean a country, a prison, the contiguous, single region of
<br>
space surrounding private property, achieved by direct physical
<br>
interaction, threat of violence, promises of favors? The answers are
<br>
widely divergent.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Is it violent to control and
<br>
<em>&gt; direct their behaviors?
</em><br>
<p>### Again, more specificity is needed - what kinds of methods of control
<br>
do you mean?
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Is it violent to control how much property they
<br>
<em>&gt; own?
</em><br>
<p>### Same as above. Also, do you mean property in a market situation or
<br>
property in a monopoly situation? 
<br>
<p>----------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Is it violent to make people sick?
<br>
<p>### If non-consensual, almost always yes.
