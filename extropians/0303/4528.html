From: Michael Wiik [mailto:<a href="mailto:mwiik@messagenet.com?Subject=RE:%20POLITICS:%20US%20Citizen%20Killed%20by%20Israelis">mwiik@messagenet.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; That's interesting, as the Israeli army has admitted it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an accident. Apparently this was an armored bulldozer with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restricted vision. 
</em><br>
<p>When I heard about this I assumed it was an accident too.  However,
<br>
below is a link to a site with pictures of the incident.  You can see
<br>
Rachel Corrie standing on a mound with what appears to be a direct
<br>
line of sight to the driver.  She's wearing a bright safety-orange
<br>
jacket and has a megaphone pointed at the driver.  
<br>
<p>After seeing this, and hearing eye witness reports, I believe this was
<br>
an act of murder.  Possibly the bulldozer driver thought she was
<br>
&quot;just&quot; a palestinian, and who would really notice or care if he killed
<br>
one of those in the course of his job?
<br>
<p>Here's the site with the pictures.  Warning: there are a couple shots
<br>
of her after being run over.  Also, this is clearly a biased site, but
<br>
the pictures speak for themselves.
