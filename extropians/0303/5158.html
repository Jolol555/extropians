<p>
I am, at this time, going to focus on one part of Charles' last response to 
<br>
me. Matus in my view did a very good job in challenging Charles moral 
<br>
position in his posts. I feel it absolutely necessary to spell out and debunk 
<br>
the blatant mischaracterization and gross distortion of historical &quot;fact&quot; 
<br>
that Charles presents in his view of 20th Century U.S. foreign policy.
<br>
<p>&quot;Germany had a democracy before WWII, and would probably have returned to 
<br>
one as a choice after defeat, though our intervention probably hastened 
<br>
things.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me see, &quot;hastened&quot; things? How about it was the ONLY thing that allowed 
<br>
it to occur? Remember, Germany was split in two, and shockingly, the 
<br>
Communist East (I know, *gasp*, a label) side was NOT a Democracy at all for 
<br>
its entire existence! Yet strangely, that side whose continued existence was 
<br>
due to the United States, the West,  &quot;somehow&quot; became a democratic republic 
<br>
under Adenauer, Brandt, Kohl and the rest.
<br>
<p>&quot;Japan's democrary is still largely a matter of form (the same 
<br>
ruling party has been in power since the start, if I'm remembering 
<br>
things correctly).  It may become more democratic with time, or at least 
<br>
adopt the &quot;two identical partys&quot; system that we use.&quot;
<br>
<p>This comment is closer to the mark, though not precisely true. Tomiichi 
<br>
Murayama of the Socialist Party was elected to the Prime Minister position in 
<br>
1995. Contrast that with say, Communist Laos, well there still has been zero 
<br>
elections and the quality of life is abysmal to this day. With that in mind, 
<br>
the benefits that Japan reaped from being a proxy of the United States as 
<br>
opposed to one of the Soviet Union remain blatantly obvious to any impartial 
<br>
observer.
<br>
<p>&quot;I'm not really 
<br>
very familiar with South Korea,&quot;
<br>
<p>Then perhaps you shouldn't comment, no?
<br>
<p>&quot;but I seem to recall that it was 
<br>
basically run by a strong-man... still that was decades ago, and I 
<br>
haven't paid much attention recently.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well, apparently you haven't paid any attention at all since the late 80's, 
<br>
when South Korea became a democracy and has since managed to elect several 
<br>
different heads of state. A significant contrast, I might add, to the 
<br>
Communist (label again) North Koreans who have never had election one! But 
<br>
again, surely a coincidence in your view I'm sure.. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Taiwan has been under the 
<br>
domination of the Nationalist Party since it took the island, but since 
<br>
their founding strong-man (sorry, I forget his name-- I keep wanting to 
<br>
say Ho Chi Minh or Sun Yat-Sen) died they have been less internally 
<br>
autocratic.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hello, President Chen Shui-Bian? The Nationalist Party lost control in the 
<br>
'99 elections. Let us compare that with Mainland China, *Communist*, where 
<br>
the population has not (you guessed it) had an election since 1949!
<br>
<p>&quot;Greece has been a Kindom, a Democracy, a 
<br>
WarLordShip??, and I guess it may be back to being a democracy again.&quot;
<br>
<p>This is ridiculous. Greece has been a democracy since 1974. An outcome that 
<br>
certainly would not have happened had the Soviet insurgency forces won in 
<br>
1947.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Again I don't know the details, but I'm guessing that their central 
<br>
government, whatever it's form, is relatively weak (a good thing from my 
<br>
point of view).  And the US supported all of the variants.  The US 
<br>
doesn't really support democracies, though it tends to like oligarcies, 
<br>
and finds it convenient if they pretend to be democracies...  sometimes 
<br>
the pretense will drift into an actuality.  This may be happening in 
<br>
Mexico.  But it isn't a short process.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, every example that we just mentioned became a democracy only because 
<br>
of direct US intervention in that country. The US did not initially support 
<br>
democracy in those countries, such as South Korea in 1950, because the choice 
<br>
there was between authoritarian (Syngman Rhee) and worse (Kim Il Sung). Yet, 
<br>
South Korea is now a democracy today. North Korea is not. In Taiwan, we 
<br>
supported an authoritarian (Jiang Jieshi) against worse (Mao Zedong). Yet, 
<br>
Taiwan is now a democracy. China is not. West Germany. Democracy. East 
<br>
Germany. Not. It might seem obvious to some that the countries supported by 
<br>
the United States had the opportunity to allow democracy to flourish, while 
<br>
those in the Soviet and Communist camp did not. However, this seems to be 
<br>
beyond what you would ever acknowledge. That being said, please explain to me 
<br>
how the 50 million people of South Korea would have democracy today had the 
<br>
US done nothing and it was conquered by the North, and how Taiwan and its 22 
<br>
million people would enjoy democracy had they been swallowed up by Mao 
<br>
Zedong's People's Republic. Those examples can be the starters. Then, please 
<br>
illustrate for me the many nations that were proxies of the Soviet Union that 
<br>
saw democracy come to their country during the time of the USSR. Since, you 
<br>
apparently claim that it is only coincidence this happens in US proxies, then 
<br>
logically by your view it should have occurred SOMEWHERE in the Communist 
<br>
camp, no?
<br>

<p>&quot;In the tumult of men and events, solitude was my temptation, now it is my 
<br>
friend. What other satisfaction can be sought once you have confronted 
<br>
history?&quot;

<p>&quot;All that talk about 'liberation' twenty, thirty, forty years ago, all the

plotting, all the bodies, produced this, this impoverished, broken-down

country led by a gang of cruel and paternalistic half-educated theorists.&quot;
