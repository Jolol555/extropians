</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Doubtless a fine piece of satire or parody [...] 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But it completely misses the idea of this thread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm. Well try this, then. The PNAC paper summation is what one's

</em><br>
<p>Sorry---but I'm too undisciplined at the moment to go 
<br>
look up PNAC.  What are you talking about?
<br>
<p>Somehow I'm starting to suppose that you still have no
<br>
idea whatsoever of what I am talking about (I could be
<br>
wrong, and it may be because I'm reading too literally).
<br>
<p>I don't see how I can make it any clearer than the above
<br>
paragraph.  Perhaps (in all literality) you would answer
<br>
some questions?  (Thanks!)
<br>
<p>1.  Do you agree that, if one had the time to spare,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the inclination, that it would be a learning
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experience to be able to articulate one's political
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;opponents' viewpoints?
<br>
<p>2.  Have you ever tried to do this?  (Frankly, it's been
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ages since I have, at least in political discussions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in the 7th grade, my little liberal friend
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and I joked that we *could* do it, so familiar had we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;become with each other's viewpoint.  Oddly, I feel
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;less capable of doing this now than then!?)
<br>
<p>3.  If you did try to do what Steve Davies did, that is,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to eloquently state his political opponent's views
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the mildest and most rational way---exactly as 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;they would have---do you think (pretend that there
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was a LOT of money in it for you) that you could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually do it?
<br>
<p>4.  Or would you simply come to a sudden awkward stop
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(as indeed might happen to me!) when the seeming 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lack of common sense and good judgment became so
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;appallingly absent in the conservatives' views 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you were attempting to espouse?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Instead, I'll befriend the adversary and, as a friend, relate my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding by shortening the whole paper to my 'pre-bomb the middle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; east' summation. The author giggles a bit at the bluntness of it but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nods his head. So I meet your condition yet you say I totally miss your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.
</em><br>
<p>No.  You have not met my condition.  You must find something
<br>
a lot less extreme than &quot;pre-bomb the Middle East&quot;.  On the
<br>
*face* of it that sounds unreasonable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For an example, read 'A Clean Break: A New Strategy for Securing the 
</em><br>
<p>I will.  And I will start a new thread on that.  This thread is 
<br>
non-political.
<br>
<p>5.  Can you imagine how it could be non-political?
<br>
<p>6.  The phrase &quot;pre-bomb the middle east&quot;, of course, appears
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nowhere in the paper.  But you have talked to the author?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have seen him giggle a bit but nod his head?  Or are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you using &quot;artistic license&quot; again?
