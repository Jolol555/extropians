<em>&gt; &gt; relations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Who really cares about that, if you succeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in destroying a murderous, ruthless, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; horrifying regime like the U.S.S.R.?   Okay,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so the lefties scored a few points on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; campuses when the U.S. set up a pro-Western
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iran.  But the end result was that there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no U.S.S.R. today.
</em><br>
<p>I actually don't know much of the Iran episode, I got
<br>
the image from what you said of the US marching troops
<br>
into a country holding an election and saying, &quot;we
<br>
don't think it's democratic.  Do it our way&quot;,
<br>
something that could have spurned a coup in the US. 
<br>
As to subverting 'allegedly democratic' elections as a
<br>
general rule it would take a very strong effort to
<br>
prove the case.  As to the USSR, we were taught, as
<br>
the coming down of the Berlin Wall and the Soviet
<br>
collapse were the big events of my middle school
<br>
years, that much of the bloodbath that was the Soviet
<br>
regime wasn't even known until after the fall.  This
<br>
would certainly throw bad light on a number of US
<br>
actions, but I can't know how aware people really
<br>
were/politicians were.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; OTOH, an Iraqi soldier capturing a US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; soldier with just general strategy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; knowledge, assuming said Iraqi intends
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to defend his country, could easily view
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; torturing information out as the only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; way to stand a fighting chance. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, he may.  Or maybe he won't.  Or it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may depend.  
</em><br>
<p>I was very careful to insert the word 'could', since I
<br>
have no clue what Iraqis of any slant actually do feel
<br>
about this war outside of the conflicting forces of
<br>
the press, the government, and potentially fake
<br>
web-logs.  But certainly, they could view it, and
<br>
might shed some light on why US soldiers were captured
<br>
and held prisoner (and maybe tortured).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What I would like you to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is express approval or disapproval.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be reluctant to do this, so I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask some sharp questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. An Al Qaeda terrorist know where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    bomb is.  Torture him?
</em><br>
<p>Still the one in NY city, or outside the confines of
<br>
their possesion (i.e. intent to use)?  Yes of course,
<br>
do what one must to get the information out, and save
<br>
possibly millions of non-participants.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. An ex-wife of an important Iraqi general
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    is found to be living in New York under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    an assumed name.  How far should the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    U.S. military go to extract information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    that may help them win a key battle?
</em><br>
<p>If Iraq is invading and killing citizens in America,
<br>
do what you must if it involves torturing, although
<br>
hopefully with atleast an ounce of regret.  If the
<br>
ex-wife is guilty herself of atrocities, then maybe,
<br>
pending the pertinancy of the information.  If she is
<br>
innocent, and we're the invaders, no. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    (Again---not what would be expected, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    what you'd sanction.)
</em><br>
<p>I meant to not delete the earlier instances of
<br>
questioning my sanctioning...perhaps you didn't read
<br>
EVMick's full post as I only quoted part in my initial
<br>
response.  I wasn't at all concerned with shedding my
<br>
opinion on when/when not to torture, something
<br>
tangential to extropianism at best.  Just more
<br>
critiquing what seemed to be an extremely naive view
<br>
of &quot;how dare they do that to us&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. Baghdad is about to fall, but a convoy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    makes a wrong turn, and some cooks are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    captured by some very angry and hateful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    Iraqi soldiers.  *Should* they torture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    him, given that they have seen countless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    comrades cut down by American machine-
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    weapons, and have been hating Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    and non-Muslims their whole lives?
</em><br>
<p>I would recommend that they should have surrendered
<br>
themselves to the US, (not meaning I'd have the gall
<br>
to actually say this to a group of machine-gun
<br>
weilding foreigners), and explain that America has a
<br>
huge burden of not offending the rest of the world
<br>
further; they'd be treated better as a POW than on
<br>
their own (although this does contradict &quot;Live free or
<br>
die&quot;.  In a dispersed regime like Iraq it seems likely
<br>
that any given individual who didn't act out against
<br>
the government could have lived in relative freedom in
<br>
&nbsp;rural areas.  More libertarian than in the US at any
<br>
rate, but only for a very few rare cases).  
<br>
<p>But their view of the situation is almost certainly
<br>
skewed, so based on what MIGHT be their view being
<br>
true, in that America is a hostile invader hell bent
<br>
on killing them and declaring war on their religion,
<br>
yes torture.  I can't relate further than this since
<br>
I'll never see the world from Muslim eyes, pending
<br>
severe brain reprogramming. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4. It's 1965 and Israeli agents have just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    found a notorious war-criminal in South
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    America, and one of the Mossad agents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    had a brother tortured and killed by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    this same war criminal.  You are one
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    of the other agents.  The choice of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    group is either to kill him or torture
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    him first before killing him (extradition
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    is not an option).  One of the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    agents does not want to torture him first.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    What should you do?  What should you be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in favor of your group doing?  What would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    you say, and to whom?
</em><br>
<p>No torture.  It would serve nothing but petty revenge.
<br>
&nbsp;Hannah Arendt's book &quot;Eichmann in Jerusalem&quot; put
<br>
forth a brave stance from someone with close
<br>
connections to the third reich, that the 'evil' was
<br>
banal and not this epitome of monstrousity most people
<br>
associate with the Nazi regime.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, there's the obvious caveat I failed to
<br>
mention in my first response, that when one group is
<br>
willing to torture, their opposition may feel less
<br>
reservations to doing it back to them when the tables
<br>
are turned.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; All-out war has no rules. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wrong.  No one wanted to win more than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Allies or the Germans in WWI but no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used poison gas (though I admit that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly there was strong self-interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved).  The Germans scrupulously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoided bombing London in World War II
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ---it was against Hitler's policy to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bomb civilians.  But a Luftwaffe plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; went off course one night---one plane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of dozens---and dropped a very few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombs on London doing very little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damage.  The English retaliated with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite large bombing run aimed exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at a German city, and that was the start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of WWII's frightful civilian death toll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the air in both arenas of the war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There had been rules in play, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; British directly broke them.
</em><br>
<p>point taken.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Okay, before I can answer this, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would you rather have?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A few soldiers of your party captured and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tortured, or Washington routinely bombed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; communication broken off and surrounded so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that eventually if by some miracle the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; invading force doesn't break through,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everybody will inevitably starve to death?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would rather have a few of my soldiers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tortured.
</em><br>
<p>agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Not that I don't understand *why*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the coalition would choose this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strategy in the war, but certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it's not a fair fight to start with.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gasp!  Choke!  What do you think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, a game?  What do you want to see,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe the Russians come in on the Iraqi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side so that we get a really good show?
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't think it's a game, nor do I want to see
<br>
the Russians involved in this.  Further I wouldn't
<br>
want it to be a fair fight, as the day a dictatorship
<br>
can have a fair fight with the strongest nuclear power
<br>
in the world, [insert end of civilization scenario
<br>
here].  I'm not entirely certain why you got that
<br>
notion from what I said as it atleast seemed to me to
<br>
be consistent with everything else I had been writing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; although I'd keep in mind that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could have NOT invaded and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't've happened, so perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the outrage would be directed at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than one source.
</em><br>
<p>Oh good grief.  And so I suppose that
<br>
if the U.S. were to nuke Baghdad right
<br>
off the map with a 20-megatonner, you'd
<br>
have &quot;some&quot; moral outrage against the
<br>
U.S., but you'd also direct your outrage
<br>
at more than one source, say, Saddam
<br>
and Iraq?
<br>
<p>The lenses you're looking through seem
<br>
a little tilted to me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;me
</em><br>
oh, no.  I'd have &quot;plenty&quot; of outrage toward the US. 
<br>
Now, though, if Saddam's regime did something like a
<br>
bio-chem warfare that the US weren't prepared against,
<br>
and the US nukes out of fear, I'd have outrage toward
<br>
Saddam too.  Err I suppose I have outrage towards him
<br>
anyway, but more so.  And this seems to come closer to
<br>
paralleling the Iraq nuking us now situation, as
<br>
certainly they would be doing it in retaliatory fear,
<br>
no?  Although there's still a factor of having
<br>
non-combatants in Baghdad.
<br>
<p>Now, if before we touch Baghdad, the nuke flies to
<br>
Washington, then *all* the outrage goes toward the
<br>
Saddam regime.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; OTOH, if Baghdad was on the brink of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinction, (and I mean no question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they either do something drastic or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; die, surrender not even an option)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a centralized group of troops
</em><br>
<em>&gt; located in Iraq were nuked, it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly be a horrible thing,
</em><br>
<p>but, so long as it's the Americans
<br>
being nuked...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;me
</em><br>
Well no, it could be the British or Australian troops,
<br>
or the Turkish should they decide to invade.  And it's
<br>
not that I'd justify it, just that I wouldn't really
<br>
be outraged, as I'd never get outraged by an expected
<br>
reaction to an event.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; but I can't be certain I'd be outraged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at them, as they were left with no other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you *do* always have a choice.  And
<br>
that's what I'd tell the understandably
<br>
upset Mossad agent in 1965.  You can still
<br>
choose to do the right thing!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;me
</em><br>
Here I diverge greatly.  I don't believe in the very
<br>
concept of there being a 'right' thing.  And there was
<br>
no trade off involved with the Mossad agent.  Nothing
<br>
worse could come to him in not torturing.  The other
<br>
example, not only *can* something worse happen, but
<br>
something worse *will* happen, so it's easy for me to
<br>
understand the motivation even in not agreeing with it
<br>
(as I'm very non-violent personally).
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Now, take a look back at what is known
<br>
as &quot;the finest moment in American History&quot;.
<br>
Recall the unbelievably visceral hatred
<br>
that existed between Yank and Rebel.
<br>
At Appomatix courthouse in 1865, Robert E.
<br>
Lee sadly walked out of his surrender to
<br>
general Grant and addressed his troops.
<br>
<p>He could have said, &quot;We will fight in the
<br>
streets, we will fight in the hills, we
<br>
will NEVER surrender!&quot;  And if he had said
<br>
this, even unto this very moment pockets
<br>
of Rebels would be holed up in the hills
<br>
and swamps of the South.  But he did not
<br>
say this.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's all over, boys&quot;, said he.  And so it
<br>
was.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;me
</em><br>
hmmm, google tells me he didn't die till 1870, so his
<br>
life wasn't even at stake in giving up.  So we return
<br>
to what then is at stake.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes the right thing---that is, the
<br>
thing that you will approve of if you
<br>
reflect on it long enough and allow all
<br>
your knowledge and reason to come into
<br>
play---, sometimes the right thing is
<br>
to surrender.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;me
</em><br>
okay, I understand 'right' as you explain here, and
<br>
agree, but looking on the smallest scale: a force
<br>
intends to kill me, I will not surrender to death save
<br>
when my death would benefit those whom I ally
<br>
with(friends/loved ones, as others may say) in much
<br>
more multitude than my life would for me.  Now if you
<br>
agree with this principle, put it in the perspective
<br>
of who and what Saddam and his henchmen may value and
<br>
then realize we intend to either kill, or try then
<br>
execute him and a number of them (presuming living).
