</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Don't know if it develops in the story, but it seems to me that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whole whuffie economy is based on an enticement for people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behave
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the way others want them to behave and not according to their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; natures. It is peer to peer consensual fascism. Reminds me much of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; society of Brave New World.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seems to me you're describing good old free market capitalism: people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; earn money only to the extent that they do things or produce things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others want to pay for voluntarily.  Why should people be rewarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acting according to their &quot;true nature&quot;, if, for example, they are by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature predators and not honest traders?
</em><br>
<p>Well, no. A predator will find a niche as a hunter. Free market
<br>
capitalism strikes a balance between individual desires and communal
<br>
demands. I can make 1000 gizwhats a day if that makes my life
<br>
fulfilled, but if everyone else only wants 100 a day, I'm gonna have to
<br>
either find something else to do with the rest of my time or else
<br>
figure out a way to generate all the income I need to live from just
<br>
100 a day.
<br>
<p>The karma market previously described takes absolutely no consideration
<br>
for the desires of the producer and only acts as a signal of the
<br>
desires of the consumer. It is therefore an initiation of force against
<br>
those which produce that which the karma assignors are evaluating.
<br>
<p>Free market capitalism is a negotiation of the desires of both. A truly
<br>
free market karma system would balance a rating by the author of a post
<br>
of how fulfilling it was to write the post, to how fulfilled the
<br>
readers were upon reading the post.
<br>
<p>Thus, if a writer achieves total fulfillment writing a post, and
<br>
everybody in the reading pool achieved zero fulfillment reading it,
<br>
there is net zero karma, just as a writer who only wrote things which
<br>
gave total fulfillment to everyone else but none to themselves would
<br>
achieve zero karma. You get positive karma when both sides gain
<br>
fulfillment, and negative karma when both sides lose fulfillment.
<br>
<p>How you equate the value of fulfillment of the one writer to that of
<br>
the many readers is a value judgement that is entirely subjective to
<br>
your prejudices.
