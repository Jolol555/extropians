</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The United States signed the United Nations Charter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (under the Bush administration) resolution 1441. These are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solemn agreements made on very serious matters and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; breaches of them and the consequences of any breaches of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them by the US (under the Bush administration) will remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the public record longer than Saddam Hussein or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; President Bush remain at the head of their respective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nation states.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Exactly what international agreement, solemn or otherwise, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the USA breached?
</em><br>
<p>The UN Charter is the international agreement that is at issue.
<br>
Whether is has *actually* been breached I must confess I am
<br>
not as certain as I was. I am still checking out the arguments
<br>
that I only recently got access to from the governments of the
<br>
UK and Australia and so are a bunch of other folk. I do *want*
<br>
to get to the bottom of it though, it is annoying to me that there
<br>
is debate about the meaning of a written contract even now.
<br>
The whole legal uncertainty thing wreaks of bad faith and bad
<br>
judgement and possibly both.
<br>
<p>I do think that there *is* an answer to the legal question of
<br>
whether the U.S. (and/or the UK and Australia for that matter)
<br>
will be acting illegally (i.e.. in breach of the UN Charter) when
<br>
they do take military action against Iraq.
<br>
<p>(Aside: I think it would have been logically valid, moral,
<br>
honourable, and not illegal for President Bush to have, in very
<br>
particular circumstances, discovered that the US had no further
<br>
obligations under the Charter as the Charter itself had been
<br>
voided by manifest bad faith on the part of another permanent
<br>
security council member. The very lawfulness of the law at the
<br>
security council level arises because of the good faith agreement
<br>
of security council members and so, imo, when the good faith
<br>
is gone so has the obligation to continue to honour obligations
<br>
that were taken on in free exchange for the obligations of others.
<br>
<p>President Bush did not in fact take this path however.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know of no treaty the USA signed that said it will not use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; military force unless it gets the OK from the UN.
</em><br>
<p>The US did sign the UN Charter and the UN Charter at Article
<br>
2 para. 4 states &quot;Members shall refrain in their international
<br>
relations from the threat or use of force against the territorial
<br>
integrity or political independence of any state...&quot;
<br>
<p>There are two exception to the above prohibition, one under
<br>
Article 51 that relates to self-defence and another Article 42
<br>
whereby the Security Council can authorise military force.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The situation is certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not unprecedented, just a few years ago the USA kicked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Slobodan Milosovic out of power in Kosovo without a UN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blessing and it was not the end of the world, in fact I do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe the it would be a happier place if that  murderer was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still engaged in ethnic cleansing.
</em><br>
<p>The current situation can be differentiated from Kosovo in that
<br>
unlike with Kosovo, the Security Council is &quot;seized of the matter&quot;
<br>
and the US has by signing off on 1441 acknowledged that the
<br>
UN Security Council is seized of the matter. Because each
<br>
permanent security council member can &quot;veto&quot; any resolution
<br>
that it thinks is against its interests it is not very common for a
<br>
clear resolution against one the interests of a permanent
<br>
security council member to come into being. This suggests to me
<br>
that at one stage at least the Bush administration was genuinely
<br>
trying to work within the UN in good faith.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;French President  Jacques Chirac said yesterday he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; willing to accept a one-month to two month deadline
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; provided the move was endorsed by the chief UN weapons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inspectors&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Translation: France will never EVER endorse force to remove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam, it has not in the 4 ½  months since 1441 called for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disarmament or face serious consequences, and I don't think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things will be the slightest different in 5 ½  months or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6 ½ months or 666 ½  months. And a rather silly Swedish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper shuffler named Hans Blix feels the same way. As for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many Americas, they feel unwilling to trust their lives that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UN will protect them from the next massive terrorists attack;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the UN seems incapable of enforcing an overdue library
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  book fine.
</em><br>
<p>Well yes, I guess that is one *possible* translation. ;-)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
