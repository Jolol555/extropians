&quot;Eliezer S. Yudkowsky&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:sentience@pobox.com?Subject=Re:%20[POLITICS]%20Thank%20God%20for%20the%20death%20of%20the%20UN%20%20(Article)">sentience@pobox.com</a> The first results of the 
<br>
breakdown of international law
<br>
<p>Eliezer,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did anyone ever think that what we are seeing is good -- even for 
<br>
those that would like to see a true internatioanal government and law?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is true that the League of Nations failed and now it appears that 
<br>
the United Nations will fail also.  For purpose of discussion let me assume 
<br>
that the UN is dead and is just in the process of final collapse -- it is 
<br>
over but the shouting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually there may have been other attempts that collapsed.  I can 
<br>
think of at least one.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before you get totally despondant remember that the US governement 
<br>
didn't work on the first trial.  I may confuse the first one or two but we 
<br>
had the Continental Congress, then the Confederacy and finally the 
<br>
Constitution.  Does that count as two or three attempts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My understanding of the confederacy is that the states in setting up 
<br>
that government attempted to do two things at once.  They tried to surrender 
<br>
to a central government sufficient power to solve the common problems they 
<br>
perceived.  Secondly, they attempted to retain their own independence.  They 
<br>
didn't get the balance right.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we tried again and formed the Constitution.  That has worked well 
<br>
enough to hang together for 225+ years.  Maybe it hasn't worked perfectly, 
<br>
and maybe any of us could suggest a couple of changes, but last it has.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it is possible we are now going through the same process 
<br>
internationally.  The League of Nations and now the United Nations have 
<br>
failed to date.  IMHO their failure is proper.  We have not came to the point 
<br>
that we can design an international government that we trust enough to 
<br>
surrender our independence.  On the other hand we have gained practical 
<br>
experience through two failures -- one day we may succeed.
<br>
