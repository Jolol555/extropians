<p>&quot;I agree especially with her comment that FOX &quot;appeals to a younger
<br>
audience.&quot; I get that impression all the time, from the language and
<br>
attitude of the reporters. Among other things, FOX reporters are more prone
<br>
to use inflammatory language. It's highly sensationalized news reporting.
<br>
Kinda' exciting, I would agree, but hardly unbiased!&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;CNN is boring by comparison, but in my view news SHOULD be boring.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The more I watch FOX, the more I realize that it's a news network designed
<br>
for and by morons.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fox is certainly biased, and I think it is intentionally so, to present an
<br>
alternative viewing oppertunity to the portion of the population who feels
<br>
everything else, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, etc. etc have a liberal Bias.  I would
<br>
wager this explains their popularity more so than any type of
<br>
'sensationalizing' of their news.  CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN recieve some 30 - 40
<br>
million viewers collectively, while fox typically garners ~3 million.
<br>
Personally I flip back and forth, but tend to stick with fox because
<br>
conservative bias, especially in matters of foriegn policy, is much more
<br>
tolerable than liberal bias.  With stories like &quot;lets see what the
<br>
totalitarian murderous communist regime of North Vietnam thinks of this US
<br>
invasion?&quot; I would get an ulcer if I relied only on liberal biased news.
<br>
<p>I would certainly prefer a truly 'unbiased' network, and I also feel it
<br>
should be unsensationalized and 'boring' unfortunately no such network
<br>
exists.  Want to start one?
