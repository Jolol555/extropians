Hi!
<br>
<p>At 12:54 03-03-2003 -0800, you wrote:
<br>
<em>&gt;*But* the technology we need to do [1] does exist *now* (you'll just have

<p>Admittedly, I don't know what you are doing in Robiobotics. Yet my first 
<br>
reaction regarding whole genome engineering--which I'm not even sure I know 
<br>
what it is--and nanotech is somewhat skeptical. Although you didn't like it 
<br>
much, I think HIV is a good example. HIV is a small piece of genetic code 
<br>
whose activities disrupt human physiology to the point of killing us. Yet 
<br>
it is extrinsic to the human genome. Unlike aging, which, IMHO, results 
<br>
from errors in the genome that are intrinsic to human beings, defining 
<br>
&quot;errors&quot; in a very wide sense--from inconsistencies in DNA repair or 
<br>
replication to anything that may corrupt the genetic program. Although the 
<br>
breakthroughs on fighting HIV have been much superior to breakthroughs in 
<br>
aging research, the difficulty in fighting HIV proves that we don't 
<br>
understand as much about biology as we think we do--sure, I know about 
<br>
HIV's adaptability, but even so have in mind that a 10,000 nucleotides 
<br>
sequence continues to elude medical science. This to say that when I read 
<br>
about nanotech, I can't help stop feeling that our current level of 
<br>
knowledge regarding molecular biology and genetics is still very far off 
<br>
from what we need to apply nanotech. If we can't cope with the 10,000 
<br>
nucleotides of HIV, if we're still surprised that a prion can change the 
<br>
conformation of normal proteins and cause mad cow disease, how can we 
<br>
expect to have molecular assemblers fixing aging? I'm pretty sure that 
<br>
we'll have to fix a lot more than 10,000 nucleotides to fix aging. In 
<br>
addition, what we have to fix in aging will be written in the DNA of every 
<br>
cell of my body. I still believe it's possible and I will continue working 
<br>
on aging--the other option is death. Yet I want to avoid overoptimism and 
<br>
make people think of the problems that we will face. I feel this will 
<br>
increase the chances of us solving aging within a reasonable timescale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Am not sure at this time, I was at the one in AU but not the one that I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was in Korea.  Would like to get to the UK but am not sure I can make it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But Aubrey is putting together a very good program -- you should go if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the opportunity.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I should go--unless I'm really late in my thesis. I would sure like 
<br>
to meet you.
<br>
<p>All the best.
