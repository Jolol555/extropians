<br>
The notion that freedom or the extension of freedom should 
<br>
always be pursued is an interesting but paradoxical one. 
<br>
<p>Seems individually and collectively we (humans) are only 
<br>
ever free within bounds. In another way as I think Sartre put
<br>
it we are condemned to be free. Choices and the imputing
<br>
of meaning on an essentially meaningless universe falls to us
<br>
individually and collectively. Part of the process of personal
<br>
development for social creatures like us is acquiring (and
<br>
sometimes surpassing) the contemporary constructs that 
<br>
constitute the prevailing social constructions of reality. In one
<br>
sense we (humans) have more freedom than many of us 
<br>
(humans) can handle. We construct edifices to cut down 
<br>
these freedoms to what we can deal with. We 
<br>
anthropomorphise. We create gods, we label Nature, we 
<br>
invent consciousness. And some of us need to cut these
<br>
down more than others. But then we all eat, sleep and the
<br>
rest in a material world. And no amount of jumping dreaming
<br>
or wishing separates us from the material substrates on 
<br>
which our consciousness currently resides so we must 
<br>
prioritise. For even dreaming of extending freedom is an
<br>
exercise pursued by mortals within the contingency of time.
<br>
<p>At one level, like, it seems to me anyway, most intelligent
<br>
people, I support free speech, free association, freedom
<br>
of religion (and from these things which give rise to
<br>
paradoxes in itself - where does one groups right to religion
<br>
impede my right to be free from their religion) but it often 
<br>
seems to be forgotten that these freedoms are asserted 
<br>
against a perceived arbitrary or changeable limitation they
<br>
are not really sensible when asserted as absolutes. 
<br>
<p>The argument for free speech as I understand it to have 
<br>
been put by the likes of Mills and Voltaire was essentially
<br>
an argument made within the confines of particular societies
<br>
by persons aspiring and working for better societies (and 
<br>
perhaps sometimes more specifically for societies that would
<br>
be better for them). 
<br>
<p>But constraints on our freedoms come from a number of 
<br>
sources and ultimately it is not merely the tyrannies of societies
<br>
that  constrain us, it is also the contingent nature of a broader
<br>
than social reality. 
<br>
<p>Reality is in part a social construct yes, but that's not the whole
<br>
story. The universe presents to us individually as well. Individuals
<br>
can practice a scientific way of looking at the world and 
<br>
individuals can and do think for themselves. 1 +1 =  2 regardless
<br>
of what society says on the matter though society can change the
<br>
words it cannot intercede between the mind of the individual and 
<br>
their apprehension of the core concepts.
<br>
<p>And there is no appeal that can be made that will make one and 
<br>
one make other than two. Freedom has limits that are not
<br>
merely social limits. There are some truths and these are not
<br>
further reducible or deniable. Contingency exists in the universe
<br>
and therefore freedoms are finite in certain dimensions. We may
<br>
perceive no &quot;roof&quot; and therefore no total volume of freedom is
<br>
fixable but there are &quot;walls&quot; that are real in more than a social
<br>
sense.
