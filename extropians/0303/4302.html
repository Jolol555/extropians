someone said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Well, the immigrants, of course. Isn't it a good deal for everyone?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, maybe not.  
<br>
<p>Regarding the social security/pensions issues.  Let me see, what is the math 
<br>
on that? If N residents of X western country with a birthrate of Q are taxed 
<br>
K dollars over their working career of P years, and there is a resulting 
<br>
pension fund amount has a deficit of -M dollars, and so then to rectify the 
<br>
situation, we bring in L immigrants with an expected birthrate of Q*(1.Y), 
<br>
who will work for P-C years (why should they work longer? They are here for 
<br>
*fewer* years on average, obviously!),  then the resulting pension fund 
<br>
amount is a *deficit* of (-M + O)* (1.D).  This is of course an 
<br>
approximation.....
<br>
<p>I am not sure if the immigration policies put forth by the media (via &quot;think 
<br>
tank&quot; studies funded by low-cost-labor loving corporate lobbies) are correct 
<br>
or incorrect, but when I see the amount of propaganda being spewed and the 
<br>
demonization rites being performed upon immigration naysayers, I get very 
<br>
nervous.
<br>
<p>And then there is the cultural issue, and also issues of what possible 
<br>
attributes may be associated with a race that may immigrate. I am not sure 
<br>
whether these issues are significant, but when there is so much money 
<br>
available to cram these policies down the throats of the citizens of western 
<br>
cultures, I get very suspicious. 
<br>
<p>It would see to me that a country and its present situation is at least in 
<br>
some aspect a product of the people and culture that constitutes its 
<br>
citizenry. Deriving that conclusion should not be rocket science.  The well 
<br>
being of the citizens of a country is not dependent solely on the depth of 
<br>
its topsoil or the number of its oil wells. It seems to me that the culture 
<br>
of the people is a major factor in its well being. And large amounts of 
<br>
immigration from country A to country B would seem to make country B's 
<br>
culture more like country A's culture. Again, this would seem to be fairly 
<br>
straighforward.
<br>
<p>There are many other aspects of race that are not even being brought into the 
<br>
public debate. Is anyone here aware of the frictions and effects caused by 
<br>
different races in public schools? It is huge! IS this being discussed in the 
<br>
public &quot;debate&quot;?
