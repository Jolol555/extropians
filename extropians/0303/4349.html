<em>&gt;&gt;before it was economically ripe to do so.  They would live on the land
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;at a loss for a number of years in the expectation that as civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;developed in the area, the land would eventually become valuable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;But all those years of losses were wasted economic effort ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is well understood as a theory, but is there much evidence that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;has happened with land? De Soto (in The Mystery of Capitalism) claims...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The real problem with this argument is that it assumes that the people 
<br>
who lived on the land didn't like things just the way they were.  
<br>
Contemporary accounts imply that frequently the early occupiers of the 
<br>
land were quite disgusted when a (relatively) dense population center  
<br>
appeared around them.  (Even if it was clearly their fault.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Patents might see some of the same problem - people rush to get patents
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;even when they don't make that much economic sense.  The limited term
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of patents will help to avoid waste, but some still does occur.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This might be a problem in a few areas, such as patents on genes, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it's hard to see signs that this is a widespread problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It's a genuine problem because the traditional limitations on what can 
<br>
be patented are ignored in technical areas.  If someone patents all 
<br>
genes beginning with codon xxx, then this causes unreasonable injury to 
<br>
all other companies that might have competed.  (This is, I think, a 
<br>
slight exaggeration of the kinds of patents that are currently being 
<br>
issued.  But not by much.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;I think another of the big problems with patents is that most are not well
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;managed.  The transaction costs to negotiate a license are extremely high.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
Do you think this is by accident?  It tends to eliminate anyone who 
<br>
doesn't have a full time lawyer, at next to no cost to those who do.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;H...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a much bigger problem. I think many of the problems are inherent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in negotiations involving a monopoly, unless there are a large number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Monopoly is the key point here.  The number of customers is nearly 
<br>
irrelevant.  &quot;Being a monopoly means not having to say you're sorry.&quot;  
<br>
(That's a quote from a phone company official in the pre-breakup days.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
The thing is, the government is unhappy with the current rate of 
<br>
innovation.  Patents are one of the techniques that they are using to 
<br>
slow it down.  This may be good or bad, but I find it hard to doubt that 
<br>
it's happening.  Of course, I'm a programmer.  People working in areas 
<br>
with higher costs of entry might quite reasonably have a different 
<br>
perspective.  But I haven't heard any huzzah's coming from either the 
<br>
nano-tech people or the biologists, except for those in companies that 
<br>
have &quot;won the lottery&quot;.  And then not from the technologists.
