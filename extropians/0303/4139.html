<p>I'll quote the first part of the first link above:
<br>
<p>: I think we should consider funding information goods (software, movies, 
<br>
: music, etc.) through tax revenue rather than copyrights. (Those rights are 
<br>
: increasingly difficult to enforce and produce much waste by causing 
<br>
: information goods to be priced far above marginal costs.) One way to do it 
<br>
: would be to let people spend their own money to produce the information, 
<br>
: and then reimburse them based on some function of the expended cost and 
<br>
: the social benefit.
<br>
<p>Wei goes on to propose a way to derive the value of a particular
<br>
information good, which is basically to ask a small sampling of users
<br>
in such a way that they have an incentive to answer honestly.
<br>
<p>In a way what you are suggesting is that information be treated as a
<br>
public good.  Then the question is a special case of the question of
<br>
how to find the right level of funding public goods.  However it is a
<br>
particularly difficult case because every piece of information is unique
<br>
and has its own value, to a vastly greater degree than traditional public
<br>
goods like highways or dams.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless I wonder if the economics literature on public goods could
<br>
provide some insight and tools that could be applied to this case.
<br>
I have (temporarily) put a copy of what I think is a seminal paper
<br>
on this topic, The Optimal Allocation of Public Goods, by Groves and
<br>
Ledyard, on my web site at <a href="http://www.finney.org/~hal/GrovesLedyard.pdf">http://www.finney.org/~hal/GrovesLedyard.pdf</a>.
<br>
For more information, a site with many good links to papers on public
<br>
goods (towards the bottom of the page) is
<br>
<a href="http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/econ230b.html">http://www.econ.ucsb.edu/~tedb/econ230b.html</a>.
<br>
<p>The Groves and Ledyard paper falls under the category of &quot;incentive
<br>
compatible&quot; mechanisms, where the goal is basically to get people to
<br>
voluntarily tell the truth about how much things are worth to them.
<br>
Your approach accomplishes this as well, in a much simpler and more
<br>
practical way.  It's hard to imagine a Groves and Ledyard voting system
<br>
where every voter must give his estimate of the value of every single
<br>
movie, song, program and written work ever created.  For reference here
<br>
is Wei's idea:
<br>
<p>: Whenever someone first accesses a piece of information, he may be chosen 
<br>
: by the access mechanism randomly, with probability p1, to answer whether 
<br>
: he values that information more than some random amount of money $x. Then 
<br>
: with probability p2, if he answers yes, he is charged $x, otherwise he is 
<br>
: denied access to this piece of information forever. p1 and p2 are both 
<br>
: supposed to be small. In the usual case, he would just be allowed to 
<br>
: access the information for free.
<br>
<p>It does seem kind of unjust, some poor guy is going to download a song,
<br>
and the system asks him, is this song worth $1000 to you?  And he says
<br>
no, and then it says that he can never listen to that song again for the
<br>
rest of his life.  Granted this would be very uncommon, but it can't be
<br>
too uncommon or the system can't generate the necessary statistics.
<br>
<p>Doesn't this proposal also require that we know not only how much each
<br>
piece of information is worth, but also how widely it is shared?  So all
<br>
information would be downloaded from some centralized locations that kept
<br>
track of the number of downloads in addition to doing the cost analysis
<br>
above.  As you say, this gives people little incentive to pirate the data,
<br>
since almost all the time they can get whatever they want for free.
<br>
<p>Nevertheless I wonder if some other incentive compatible mechanism
<br>
could be devised which would let people share data directly, and avoid
<br>
this sort of blacklist effect where a few unlucky people are shut out
<br>
from particular works.  Maybe consumers could vote in some way for
<br>
their favorite pieces of information, and direct the tax revenues to
<br>
the creators.  This might also allow people to vote after sampling the
<br>
product rather than beforehand, which would give a more accurate estimate
<br>
of the value.
<br>
<p>Maybe you could use a Groves and Ledyard mechanism to set the value of the
<br>
total pool of money to be disbursed to information creators, and then a
<br>
simpler voting system like this could control how the money is divided.
<br>
People would have an incentive in the voting to be reasonably accurate
<br>
since they would want more money to go to the creators of information
<br>
that they value.  And they would only need to vote for the specific
<br>
information goods they had found valuable in the recent past, so with
<br>
some computer aid it might be a practical system.
