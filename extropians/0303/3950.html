Forwarding the private reply of Tom Van Flandern - twc:
<br>
<p>*****
<br>
Terry,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks for your e-note. The &quot;logic&quot; of Ron Ebert [&quot;re&quot; below] is
<br>
amusing. Most of these complaints arose because he did not read the
<br>
original article with citations, but only the capsulized summary of four
<br>
points that struck someone's fancy in &quot;Science Frontiers&quot;. Apparently
<br>
Ebert's rebuttal, which makes unsubstantiated claims about four points
<br>
from a list of 30, is supposed to imply that the whole list is
<br>
defective. That itself is invalid reasoning. And none of these four
<br>
points were among the top 10 in the list. Here are my specific comments
<br>
on the Ebert message:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;[re]: first let's see the credibility of the person making the claims.
</em><br>
[citing totally unrelated matter of artificial structures on Mars]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the unscientific technique called &quot;discrediting by
<br>
association&quot;. If you can't win an argument on merit, attack your
<br>
opponent on some other issue where he/she seems vulnerable. Note that
<br>
the merits of that side issue are not raised either. This is an attempt
<br>
to discredit an opponent purely by association, without any
<br>
consideration of the merit of either issue. Recognize the tactic for
<br>
what it is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;[sf article]: The Big Bang predicts that equal amounts of matter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;antimatter were created. If so, we don't know what happened to all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;antimatter.
</em><br>
<p>[re]: The Big Bang makes no such prediction. The BB says nothing about
<br>
this. You may as well complain that the BB fails to explain why Mars is
<br>
red. The resolution of the problem will be in an as yet undeveloped
<br>
unifying theory like a Grand Unified Theory. We already know that the
<br>
nuclear weak force is asymmetric. The weak force is probably involved
<br>
with the resolution of the problem.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Big Bang predicts that equal amounts of matter and
<br>
antimatter were created in the initial explosion. Matter dominates the
<br>
present universe apparently because of some form of asymmetry, such as
<br>
CP violation asymmetry, that caused most anti-matter to annihilate with
<br>
matter, but left much matter. Experiments are searching for evidence of
<br>
this asymmetry, so far without success. Other galaxies can't be
<br>
antimatter because that would create a matter-antimatter boundary with
<br>
the intergalactic medium that would create gamma rays, which are not
<br>
seen. [Sources: Sci.News 158, 86 (2000); Science 278, 226 (1997).]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;[sf article]: The Big Bang violates the First Law of Thermodynamics
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;by requiring that new space in the expanding universe be filled with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;zero-point&quot; energy.
</em><br>
<p>[re]: Another false claim. The conservation of energy has to hold in
<br>
local conditions. There is no requirement under general relativity that
<br>
it has to hold under global conditions. See
<br>
<a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html</a>. As
<br>
for zero point energy, if by that term you mean the net energy balance
<br>
provided by virtual particles, as above the BB says nothing about it.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Big Bang violates the first law of thermodynamics, that
<br>
energy cannot be either created or destroyed, by requiring that new
<br>
space filled with &quot;zero-point energy&quot; (the Casimir effect) be
<br>
continually created between the galaxies. Wherever that new space and
<br>
energy appears is &quot;local&quot; to that place, and clearly violates the first
<br>
law. [Source: B.R. Bligh, &quot;The Big Bang Exploded!&quot; (2000),
<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:brbligh@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20(Pvt)%20Re:%20The%20bottom%20two-thirds%20of%20a%20cosmological%20iceberg%20?">brbligh@hotmail.com</a>&gt;.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;[sf article]: Redshifts are quantized for both galaxies and quasars,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;as are some other properties of the galaxies. All this is verboten under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Big Bang rules.
</em><br>
<p>[re]: Yet another false claim. Redshifts are not quantized. This is
<br>
from the December 2002 Sky and Telescope:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fact that redshifts are quantized for nearby galaxies had
<br>
already been confirmed in an earlier independent study. The new study
<br>
(quoting a news article dated *after* the top 30 list was published)
<br>
does not distinguish between these two conflicting results.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Quantization also occurs for quasars and for properties of
<br>
galaxies other than redshift. None of these should happen under Big Bang
<br>
premises. [Sources: Astrophys.J. 393, 59-67 (1992); Guthrie &amp; Napier,
<br>
Mon.Not.Roy.Astr.Soc. 12/1 issue (1991); Astron.J. 121, 21-30 (2001);
<br>
Astron.&amp;Astrophys. 343, 697-704 (1999).]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;[sf article]: Big Bang theory requires that the fine-structure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;constant must vary with time; a claimed but controversial phenomenon.
</em><br>
<p>[re]: See? It's a whole list of make believe claims. The BB says
<br>
nothing at all about the fine structure constant.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under Big Bang premises (specifically, if quasars are at their
<br>
redshift distances), the fine structure constant must vary with time.
<br>
[Source: Phys.Rev.Lett. 9/03 issue (2001).]
<br>
<p>[re]: This is the guy who also insists that gravity doesn't travel at
<br>
the speed of light and can't get out of a black hole. See [two links]
<br>
for the refutations.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But why neglect to cite the latest publication on this matter,
<br>
which (unlike the two web sites) is peer-reviewed? This article not only
<br>
answers those objections to the satisfaction of reviewers and editors,
<br>
but does the same for every objection raised to date, and concludes with
<br>
unchallenged reasoning that the &quot;universal speed limit&quot; is no longer in
<br>
effect in physics. See [&quot;Experimental Repeal of the Speed Limit for
<br>
Gravitational, Electrodynamic, and Quantum Field Interactions&quot;, T. Van
<br>
Flandern and J.P. Vigier, Found.Phys. 32(#7), 1031-1068 (2002)].
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now if I have grasped the essence of Ebert's reasoning, I should
<br>
be able to apply his same type of arguments to my own advantage: A
<br>
respected, senior physicist has joined me as a co-author of a carefully
<br>
scrutinized publication in a prestigious mainstream physics journal
<br>
containing a result of importance to physics. Because that result has
<br>
the weight of undisputed authority, everyone should now pay attention to
<br>
my Big Bang arguments, and can safely conclude that there probably *are*
<br>
artificial structures on Mars. Right? :-) -|Tom|-
