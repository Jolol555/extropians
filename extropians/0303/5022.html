</em><br>
<p>I would suggest that what it is a charcteristic of is autocratic 
<br>
governments, where the power is centralized, and where the person who 
<br>
controls the power is one who has acquired his job by being move skilled 
<br>
at power politics than at diplomatic manuvering.  In this context I 
<br>
consider assination and deceit to be parts of power politics rather then 
<br>
diplomacy.
<br>
<p>This description predicts that dictatorships will generally tend more 
<br>
towards massive violence than monarchies, and that oligarchies will fall 
<br>
in between, but note that a lot depends on the character of the 
<br>
autocrat.  This is an inevitable feature of centralized autocracies, 
<br>
though many of them are built around a social structure that tends to 
<br>
encourage some particular type emerging.
<br>
<p>That which is called Communism then becomes a special case.  But the 
<br>
principles are much more general, having in large part to do with the 
<br>
relative power of the various parties, and the degree of immunity felt 
<br>
by the autocrat.  (It could, however, be argued that some personality 
<br>
types are more likely to lash out visciously against weak targets when 
<br>
they feel threatened.)
<br>
<p>Please remember that Communism and Democrary are names.  They don't 
<br>
describe any real systems, or they describe them so vaguely that the 
<br>
terms can include widely variant systems.  I, personally, tend more 
<br>
towards classifying things as variations on cultural continuity.  Thus I 
<br>
had though that Mao was setting up a new Empire, and now suspect that 
<br>
what is really happening is the developing of a Mandrinate.  I think 
<br>
that Stalin was more like Ivan the Terrible than like any other 
<br>
personage of note, etc.  The names used on the surface as often mislead 
<br>
as enlighten.  Just consider the term &quot;People's Democratic Republic&quot;,  a 
<br>
less descriptive term would be difficult to invent with intent.  But it 
<br>
was probably adopted (at least the first time) will full intention of 
<br>
living up to the name.
<br>
<p>Back to the thread:
<br>
I'm not sure that a private military-industrial complex would be any 
<br>
different than what we've got.  But I'm not sure it would be any worse.  
<br>
In fact, if I look at who buys what from whom, it seems quite likely to 
<br>
be a desription of the current system, though governments tend to 
<br>
actively suppress the independant contractors.  But then I believe that 
<br>
it would be a safe prediction that whoever became the dominant military 
<br>
contractor would act to suppress the competition.  (And *that's* the 
<br>
weakness of libertarian theory.  Monopolies need to be prevented.  It 
<br>
should be seen as one of the legitimate functions of government.)
