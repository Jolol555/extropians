<p>
There's actually another level of parallelism implied by modern physics
<br>
beyond Tegmark's four, at least if we accept certain philosophical views.
<br>
This comes from Hans Moravec's ideas of instantiation or re-instantiation
<br>
of conscious entities via simulation.
<br>
<p>If we accept that simulated beings can be conscious at all (that's
<br>
the philosopical leap), then the forms of parallelism discussed by
<br>
Tegmark all imply that there are worlds where beings are simulating
<br>
other possible worlds.  In fact, there are an infinite number of such
<br>
simulation-containing worlds, and an infinite number of such simulations.
<br>
Hence everything exists both as a real world in reality, and as a
<br>
simulated world in any number of simulations.
<br>
<p>We can then ask, what percentage of instantiations of a given world X
<br>
exist in the real universe versus in simulations?  This is a question
<br>
that is answerable in principle, at least if we stick to a simple form
<br>
of parallelism like Tegmark's level one (namely that in a spatially
<br>
infinite universe, all possible worlds exist an infinite number of times).
<br>
<p>You'd have to estimate what fraction of worlds evolve intelligent life
<br>
forms capable of performing such simulations.  These would include worlds
<br>
whose past history is identical to our own but which are farther along
<br>
their developmental path because they got started a little earlier.
<br>
They would have seen a slightly younger universe than we do now, but
<br>
given the uncertainties, they could easily be at least many thousands
<br>
of years ahead of us and still have us be a valid model of their past.
<br>
<p>If we assume that we are &quot;almost there&quot; as far as having simulation
<br>
capability adequate to simulate ourselves, this suggests that about
<br>
half of all worlds like us will be enough advanced to be running such
<br>
simulations (i.e. the half which is older than us).  If each one runs
<br>
exactly one simulation of its past that includes us, then that would imply
<br>
that the chances of us presently being in such a simulation are about 1/3
<br>
(because each such advanced world represents two instantiations of our
<br>
consciousness, and half of all worlds are advanced like that).
<br>
<p>However if these worlds (which, remember, are like us but thousands
<br>
of years more advanced) are also capable of marshalling sufficient
<br>
resources to run multiple simulations of pasts that include us, then
<br>
the odds become even larger that we are in one of those simulations.
<br>
<p>So I'd suggest that the assumption that the universe is infinite in
<br>
extent, and/or that cosmic inflation exists, combined with the assumption
<br>
that simulations are consciousness, gives us good reason to believe that
<br>
we are presently in such a simulation.
<br>
<p>Moravec argued the same thing with respect to future civilizations,
<br>
I think.  Even if there is only one world, if it eventually runs many
<br>
simulations then we are probably in one such.  The variant based on
<br>
multiple worlds makes the argument a bit more concrete, in that these
<br>
simulations might actually be occuring &quot;now&quot;.
<br>
<p>The big question is how much of the universe's computational resources
<br>
are being devoted to running simulations of worlds that contain conscious
<br>
observers, versus the number of actual worlds containing such observers.
<br>
I think it's likely that simulations would be biased towards such worlds,
<br>
so even if a relatively small fraction of conscious-observer-containing
<br>
worlds are presently running such simulations, they might still account
<br>
for a large fraction of the total instantiations of consciousness.
