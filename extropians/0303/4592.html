<p>What's the quote - &quot;millions long for immortality who don't know what to

<p>Neoteny: basic mental health (cognitive style), a dash of Zen to clear the

brain, etc. Maybe I'm one of those people who are too young, but I know
<br>
people who are very old and have youthful minds/happy spirits. So to know
<br>
it is possible is to simply need to look for the method. Reminds me of the
<br>
Anne Rice vampires who get bored with their immortal lives every oncein a
<br>
while, go into a lethargic funk or catatonic stupor every couple
<br>
centuries, then reinvent themselves and reinvigorate themselves ina  new
<br>
world.
