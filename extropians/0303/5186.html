<p>
First, a joke circulating in Romania concerning American
<br>
politics:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Mr. President, I am your doctor; I am sorry to inform
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you, that you have a problem in your BRAIN.  Your brain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has two parts, one Left and one Right.  The Left Part
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has nothing right in it, and the Right Part has nothing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;left in it.&quot;
<br>
<p>Pretty good command of English there, I'd sure say!
<br>
<p>Anyway, I thought that it would be interesting to note how
<br>
the first Western attacks on the Middle East went down, back
<br>
a while ago:
<br>
<p>(Sorry that I cannot vouch for either the historical accuracy
<br>
or the syntax of the following.)   Crusader Habit:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were no more than 12,000 crusaders that, in July 1099 after a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;three year campaign, got to camp under the walls of Jerusalem.  Their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;emotion in sighting the sacred city changed into surprise when the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;presiding Muslim garrison declared to be ready for an armistice.  That
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;garrison wasn’t Turkish but Arab, because the previous year Jerusalem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had been retaken from the Selgiuchi by the Fatimidi, who had never
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;confronted the Franchi.  But they didn’t accept the offer perhaps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;because they thought a non-violent negotiation would have ruined their
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;triumph. Therefore they demanded unconditional surrender.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The defenders, about 1000 men, resisted for 40 days.  Then they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;surrendered.  “Then,” a witness present, Raimondo de Agiles, famous for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;his zeal and his beheaded of killed by harrow or thrown from the towers.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Others were tortured for days and days and then torched. The streets
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were strewn with heads, chopped hands and feet.”
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Those marvelous things lasted until the total consummation of the 70
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;000 citizens of Jerusalem, including the Jews. They were crowded and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;burned inside the synagogues.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the crusaders gathered in the grotto of the Santa Sepolcro that had
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hosted the remains of Christ, who had come into the world to preach
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“misericordia”, and there they cried joyfully feeling worthy of him.”
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--From vol. 7, pg. 112 of Storia D’Italia by Montanelli On the first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;crusade year 1099
