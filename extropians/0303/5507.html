</em><br>
<em>&gt; In other words, you're requesting that extropians with strong

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize you're vice-president of the Extropy Institute, and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorry Greg; I cannot and will not support your view on this subject. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My friendly advice to you as your would-be political 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consultant (take it or leave it) is to let matters be. If you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't want to read the messages on the extropian discussion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list during this time of war then by all means don't. It's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your choice. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your apparent attempt to be controlling is, in my would-be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political consultant's view, despicable from an extropian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perspective. It could ultimately lead to your demise.

<p>I guess I'm not making myself clear.  In quite a few posts, I don't see
<br>
&quot;debate&quot; -- I see inflammatory rhetoric and a LACK of real discussion
<br>
and debate.  I'm asking for people to 1) tone down the rhetoric and 2)
<br>
abstain from mere repetition.  
<br>
<p>This is one of the longest-running discussion lists on the net and I
<br>
mean to keep it running and at as high a level as possible. I don't know
<br>
if you were on the list when it happened, but once before I imposed a
<br>
brief moratorium on the discussion of a particular topic that had -- in
<br>
the opinion of very many posters -- gotten out of hand because of the
<br>
vitriolic tone that a few posters had reached in their rhetoric.  Some
<br>
of the folks I -- and many others -- felt were causing the problem were
<br>
on other topics quite valuable members of our online community.  The
<br>
moratorium was not universally popular in a &quot;political&quot; sense, but I
<br>
have served as what passes for &quot;law and order&quot; on this list for a long
<br>
time now.  I've tried to exercise that authority with the lightest
<br>
possible hand.  At the time of the previous moratorium, I had the
<br>
complete backing of the full list of ExI's officers and directors.  I
<br>
haven't asked for a &quot;mandate&quot; in this situation, but am acting on my own
<br>
observations, and reacting to off-list comments I've received about the
<br>
recent tone of discussions about the war and notice of the departure of
<br>
some valuable members of this community.
<br>
<p>I absolutely agree with you that the current shift in the geopolitical
<br>
realm is important and OUGHT to be a subject we can discuss here -- IN A
<br>
CIVIL MANNER.  I am simply asking every list member to exercise a little
<br>
restraint.
<br>
<p>Greg Burch
<br>
Vice-President, Extropy Institute
