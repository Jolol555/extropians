<p>
This is the second official announcement of the Secretary of PUKE
<br>
(Professional Uplifting Killing Experience)
<br>
<p>FWD:
<br>
<p>Unedited Videotape Is Raw, Painful - and Devastating
<br>
Robert Fisk , The Independent
<br>
<p>BAGHDAD, 28 March 2003 - Two British soldiers lie dead on a Basra
<br>
roadway, a small Iraqi girl - victim of a US/UK airstrike - is
<br>
brought to hospital with her intestines spilling our of her stomach,
<br>
a terribly wounded woman screams in agony as doctors try to take off
<br>
her black dress. An Iraqi general, surrounded by hundreds of his
<br>
armed troops, stands in central Basra and announces that Iraq's
<br>
second city remains firmly in Iraqi hands. The unedited Al-Djazaira
<br>
videotape - filmed over the past 36 hours and newly arrived in
<br>
Baghdad - is raw, painful, devastating.
<br>
<p>It is also proof that Basra - reportedly &quot;captured'' and &quot;secured''
<br>
by British troops last week - is indeed under the control of Saddam
<br>
Hussein's forces. Despite claims by British officers that some form
<br>
of uprising has broken out in Basra, cars and buses continue to move
<br>
through the streets while Iraqis queue patiently for gas bottles as
<br>
they are unloaded from a government truck. A remarkable part of the
<br>
tape shows fireballs blooming over western Basra and the explosion of
<br>
incoming - and presumably British - shells. The short sequence of the
<br>
dead British soldiers for the public showing of which Tony Blair
<br>
expressed such horror yesterday - is little different from dozens of
<br>
similar clips of dead Iraqi soldiers shown on British television over
<br>
the past 12 years, pictures which never drew any expressions of
<br>
condemnation from the British prime minister. The two Britons, still
<br>
in uniform, are lying on a roadway, arms and legs apart, one of them
<br>
apparently hit in the head, the other shot in the chest and abdomen.
<br>
<p>Another sequence from the same tape shows crowds of Basra civilians
<br>
and armed men in civilian clothes, kicking the soldiers' British Army
<br>
Jeep - registration number HP5AA - and dancing on top of the vehicle.
<br>
Other men can be seen kicking the overturned Ministry of Defense
<br>
trailer, registration number 91KC98, which the Jeep was towing when
<br>
it was presumably ambushed.
<br>
<p>Also to be observed on the unedited tape - which was driven up to
<br>
Baghdad on the open road from Basra - is a British pilotless drone
<br>
photo-reconnaissance aircraft, its red and blue roundels visible on
<br>
one wing, shot down and lying overturned on a roadway. Marked &quot;ARMY''
<br>
in capital letters, it carries the code sign ZJ300 on its tail and is
<br>
attached to a large cylindrical pod which probably contains the
<br>
plane's camera. Far more terrible than the pictures of the dead
<br>
British soldiers, however, is the tape from Basra's largest hospital
<br>
as victims of the US/UK bombardment are brought to the operating
<br>
rooms shrieking in pain.
<br>
<p>A middle-aged man is carried into the hospital in pyjamas, soaked
<br>
head to foot in blood. A little girl of perhaps four is brought into
<br>
the operating room on a trolley, staring at a heap of her own
<br>
intestines protruding from the left side of her stomach. A
<br>
blue-uniformed doctor pours water over the little girl's guts and
<br>
then gently applies a bandage before beginning surgery. A woman in
<br>
black with what appears to be a stomach wound cries out as doctors
<br>
try to strip her for surgery. In another sequence, a trail of blood
<br>
leads from the impact of an incoming - presumably British - shell.
<br>
<p>Next to the crater is a pair of plastic slippers.
<br>
<p>The Al-Djazaira tapes, most of which have never been seen - are the
<br>
first vivid proof that Basra remains totally outside British control.
<br>
Not only is one of the city's main roads to Baghdad still open - this
<br>
is how the three main tapes reached the Iraqi capital - but Iraqi
<br>
general Khaled Hatem is interviewed in a Basra street, surrounded by
<br>
hundreds of his uniformed and armed troops, and telling Al-Djazaira's
<br>
reporter that his men will &quot;never'' surrender to Iraq's enemies.
<br>
Armed Baath Party militiamen can also be seen in the streets, where
<br>
traffic cops are directing lorries and buses near the city's Sheraton
<br>
Hotel.
<br>
<p>Mohamed Al-Abdullah, Al-Djazaira's correspondent in Basra, must be
<br>
the bravest journalist in Iraq right now. In the sequence of three
<br>
tapes, he can be seen conducting interviews with families under fire
<br>
and calmly reporting the incoming British artillery bombardment. One
<br>
tape shows that the Sheraton Hotel on the banks of Shatt Al-Arab
<br>
River, has sustained shell damage. On the edge of the river - beside
<br>
one of the huge statues of Iraq's 1980-88 war martyrs each pointing
<br>
an accusing finger across the waterway toward Iran - Basra residents
<br>
can be seen filling jerry cans from the sewage polluted river.
