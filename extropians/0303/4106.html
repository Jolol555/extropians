I have a better idea....
<br>
<p>-For the days that you need a car, strive, as you are now, for the
<br>
cleanest and the most efficient automobile.
<br>
<p>-For the days that your car needs are questionable, leave it at home,
<br>
and take your bicycle.
<br>
<p>Consider taking your bicycle on vacations and on weekends out.
<br>
<p>Consider your bicycle as your first means of transport when you
<br>
visit someplace new.
<br>
<p>Consider family holidays to be a mobile family on n*two wheels.
<br>
<p>Consider it as a healthy alternative to sitting in front of the boob tube.
<br>
(That American slang describes much of Italian T.V...)
<br>
<p>To get you started,
<br>
<p>Adventure Cycling Online Journals  (400 files available)
<br>
<a href="http://www.adv-cycling.org/journals/">http://www.adv-cycling.org/journals/</a>
<br>
(I especially enjoy the writings of Willie Weir)
<br>
<p>I've been a member of Adventure Cycling since 1980, and can vouch
<br>
for their skill in promoting the best aspects of bicycle touring.
<br>
While I've not been on any of their organized tours (usually I tour
<br>
with one other person or else alone), they often have the maps that
<br>
I need, and their reader's stories in their monthly magazine are
<br>
inspiring, sometimes giving me ideas of places to bike tour next.
<br>
They devote most of their attention to mapping new U.S. routes
<br>
(although they are supportive and enthusiastic of bike touring
<br>
outside of the U.S., too) and they give organized tours of duration
<br>
a few days -- one month.
<br>
<p>The Adventure Cyclists monthly magazine is one of the few magazines
<br>
that I subscribe to which I read cover to cover. The best part of
<br>
this group of people is their attitude. For example, in the
<br>
&quot;Companions Wanted&quot; section of the magazine, where folks are seeking
<br>
other people to tour with, you will often find these kinds of
<br>
descriptions of themselves and their desired route:
<br>
<p>&quot;In Shape and Ready to Ride. I am 61 years young male and in good
<br>
shape and somewhat experienced in riding long distances. Looking for
<br>
someone to share the fun of the road with me....&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Southern Africa. I'm a Peace Corps volunteer who will be finishing
<br>
my service this African winter/northern hemisphere summer and am
<br>
looking for cycling partners to explore southern Africa, possibly
<br>
Malawi, Botswana, or Namibia. 30-60 miles per day depending on
<br>
terrain, road conditions...&quot; [a woman sent this in]
<br>
<p>&quot;Counselor, companion wanted for three 16 year old boys who wish
<br>
to ride the entire Great Divide route....&quot;

<br>
<p><p>Bike touring is, in my opinion, the best way to experience a new
<br>
place because you travel slowly enough to really see/smell the
<br>
environment, you eat the local food on the way through (you can eat
<br>
as much as you want, so no worry about diets), and you do your best
<br>
to communicate with the local people. You're a tourist, but you are
<br>
also intimately tied to the area that you are traveling through.
<br>
Since my 20s I've bike toured a couple thousand miles on my bicycle,
<br>
not huge miles by hardcore biker standards, but I notice that my time
<br>
spent on my bicycles is increasing, rather than decreasing, as I get
<br>
older.
<br>
<p>And if you spend time with your bike, getting to know it as an
<br>
intimate friend, it will support you in more ways than just carrying
<br>
your weight as you travel. The process of putting my bicycle
<br>
together from its pieces and then being totally dependent on it and
<br>
myself, in strange foreign places has done more for my confidence
<br>
than anything else in the area of learning self-reliance
<br>
and self-responsibility, and being open and trusting in the world.
<br>
<p>If I'm hot and bothered about something, especially for weeks
<br>
at a time, the solution for me is to pack up my bike and go for some
<br>
days or more and get a dose  of the unfailing warm friendliness
<br>
that exudes from humankind.
<br>
<p>The Web has been a boon for cycle tourists, telling their stories.
<br>
<p>One of the best sites is the Trento site:
<br>
<p>&quot;Trento Bike Pages, the portal for bicycle touring and recreational
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;mountain biking in Europe and the Mediterranean.&quot;

<p>Here's another good one:
