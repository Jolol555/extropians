Lee noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;My other theory is that the left has inherited a tradition,
<br>
or aspects of a tradition, that goes all the way back to Lenin.
<br>
In revolutionary Russia, Lenin and his followers labeled 
<br>
themselves the Bolsheviks, or &quot;Majority&quot;.  It was a conscious
<br>
political move to (evidently) subtly affect the semantics of
<br>
the discourse, so that they'd retain a psychological advantage.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Lenin also said: &quot;Probe with a bayonet. When you strike steel, withdraw! When 
<br>
you hit mush, dig in!&quot; This explains the success of Rightist media, which 
<br>
identifies itself, without aprobrium; and a Leftist media which hides behind 
<br>
centrist, or middle of the road, identification. Let us look at the liberal 
<br>
record on foreign policy, and see what has been accomplished? In fact, the 
<br>
Bush the 1st record on foreign policy, even considering the idiotic handling 
<br>
of Saddam, after his disengagement from Kuwait is worth criticizing. Not only 
<br>
is the old media leftist, but the State Dept is also thus. It, being a 
<br>
subsidiary of George Washington University. I am not sure who the State 
<br>
Department represents, but it doesn't appear to be most Americans, either 
<br>
liberal or conservative. Ah! a point of unity mayhaps?
