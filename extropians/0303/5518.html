<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin wrote, in another thread: 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We *all* have ideological blinders.  Just some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of us refuse to admit it, or aren't aware of it. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It's mundane, but we can start with the definition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;ideology&quot; from dictionary.com: 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  1. The body of ideas reflecting the social needs and aspirations of an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     individual, group, class, or culture. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  2. A set of doctrines or beliefs that form the basis of a political, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     economic, or other system. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; In the crudest form, ideological blinders prevent someone from seeing and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about facts which would contradict the ideology.
</em><br>
<p>The most important aspect to me is whether we can distinguish
<br>
political ideologies---in their effects---from other systems 
<br>
of belief.  For example, most of your analysis might equally
<br>
well apply, it seems to me, to my convictions about
<br>
certain scientific or historical matters.  If we take some 
<br>
theory that I've been exposed to for a long time, e.g., the
<br>
Copenhagen collapse of the wave function, and I persist for
<br>
decades in being unconvinced by it, then so far as I can tell
<br>
the case is quite similar to that of political ideology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As part of the mechanism, the blinders are sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imperceptible, so that the ideologue thinks he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering issues dispassionately and objectively.
</em><br>
<p>I have to ask, how do people manage to consider issues 
<br>
&quot;dispassionately and objectively&quot; when they've already
<br>
consistently reached certain conclusions years ago?
<br>
You could take the extreme case of scientists who cling
<br>
to theories that they've espoused all their lives; but
<br>
even without going that far, it inflicts almost tangible
<br>
*pain* to be forced to discard a major belief you've
<br>
held on to for years.
<br>
<p>Here is the reason for that:  we all want to have some
<br>
kind of understanding of our world, and if a significant
<br>
chunk of your understanding is shown to be unsupportable,
<br>
then you have this swimming sensation;  almost as if 
<br>
years of work is being lost.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More often, I think, people are at least vaguely aware
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they have blinders, but they accept them.  You often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hear people say things like, &quot;my mind's made up about that, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't want to hear any more about it.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>You do??  Then we are not talking about the same thing.
<br>
I very seldom hear anyone say that.
<br>
<p>Here is a description of how I think the &quot;blinders&quot; work.
<br>
To take a crude example, let's suppose that contrary to
<br>
&quot;common sense&quot;, you acquire at an impressionable age the
<br>
belief that the Earth circles the sun, instead of vice-
<br>
versa.  By and by, the rest of your scientific knowledge,
<br>
indeed, perhaps a great deal of your general knowledge
<br>
is influenced and conditioned on that &quot;fact&quot;.  Thus, in
<br>
a very important way, all your information is being
<br>
*filtered* by the supposition that the Earth circles the
<br>
sun.  You more or less systematically discard any information
<br>
that arises---e.g., witnessing a particularly beautiful
<br>
sunrise---that might in some way serve to contradict your
<br>
conditioned hypothesis.
<br>
<p>Well, bottom line, I think that this is the way it is with
<br>
political ideologies as well.  Unlike scientific beliefs or
<br>
historical facts, these do not lend themselves to ordinary
<br>
modes of refutation, however.  Ideologies are to a great
<br>
extent based upon *values*, I contend.  As such, they can
<br>
never undergo complete invalidation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So this raises the question, why do people accept ideologies that impose 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blinders?  Do they have any choice?  Lee's quote above suggests that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do not, that all ideologies impose blinders, and that (presumably) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we all have an ideology whether we know it or not.  I'm not so sure, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I won't push the point right now.
</em><br>
<p>I think that there are a great many people who do *not* have
<br>
political ideologies per se.  Often they're young.  Others
<br>
are simply disinterested in sociological issues or find 
<br>
political considerations boring.  But the rest of us?  We
<br>
have beliefs that seem to me similar in durability to our
<br>
most long-held beliefs about history or science.  Most people
<br>
reading this have some appreciation of the limitations of the
<br>
viewpoint of Karl Marx.  Therefore most of us adopt a much more
<br>
skeptical stance when listening to arguments from a Marxian or
<br>
Marxist point of view, than we would if listening to say, an
<br>
explanation of current events from a Hayekian perspective.
<br>
Is it because we sense (or we are just lazy?) that the Hayekian
<br>
analysis will be less jarring to our present perception of the
<br>
world?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, as Extropians, I think we should take a different approach. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Our philosophy is not oriented towards comfort. Rather, it is constantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involved in challenging the status quo. Extropianism is far from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream, even though it has come a long way towards acceptance in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the past 15 years. Extropians should be willing to accept intellectual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; challenge and be reluctant to take the easy road which most people follow. 
</em><br>
<p>While, as I say, I think you and I are not talking here about
<br>
the same thing, the &quot;easy road&quot; the way I look at it is almost
<br>
nothing more than an application of Occam's Razor.  Why should
<br>
I attend to sincere and apparently sophisticated arguments from
<br>
a Flat-Earther?  The main reason is simply that if he were right,
<br>
then I'd have to start from scratch with almost everything I
<br>
believe!
<br>
<p>Where I *can* take a firm and immovable position ;-)  is to reject
<br>
utterly the viewpoint that some positions on the political 
<br>
spectrum represent common sense, moral rightness, appreciation
<br>
of reality, and extensive knowledge, while other parts are
<br>
symptomatic of ignorance, low morals (i.e. &quot;mean-spiritedness&quot;),
<br>
lack of practicality, or stupidity.
<br>
<p>Yet those accusations---stupidity, &quot;can't see the obvious&quot;, &quot;are
<br>
morally infirm&quot;, &quot;lack common sense&quot;, &quot;are based on ignorance&quot;, etc.,
<br>
are exactly the reactions that one naturally *feels* when one's
<br>
most basic understanding of the universe is questioned.  The
<br>
blinders---and I do think they're real---have their most telling
<br>
effect when they force some people to conclude that their political
<br>
and ideological adversaries simply are stupid, ignorant, or immoral.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  I wish also to address Peter McCluskey's recent comments
<br>
but will do so in another post.
