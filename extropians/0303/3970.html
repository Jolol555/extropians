<em>&gt; Over the course of the past five days, and nights, I have been working
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (hard) to developing the skills necessary to successfully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; achieve Lucid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dreaming. For anyone unfamiliar with the term, it means consciously
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realizing that one is asleep and dreaming, when one is, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact, asleep and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreaming.
</em><br>
<p>Excellent.  I have had this ability since childhood.  It resulted from
<br>
watching monster horror movies and then having nightmares about them from
<br>
age 4.  I soon learned to recognize the monsters and remember that they were
<br>
from a fictional movie or TV show.  Then I realized that I was dreaming and
<br>
would try to wake up.  Later I learned that the monsters couldn't hurt me,
<br>
or that I could change the dream.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After researching the topic from a transhumanist angle (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only angle I now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possess), I've become convinced that LD may offer an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraordinarily high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolution &quot;sneak peek&quot; into what complete immersion in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seamless virtual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality, or life as an upload may be like (minus the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind-mind networking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capability of course).
</em><br>
<p>Definitely.  I have deliberately created many different landscapes or
<br>
experiences, like in a Star Trek holodeck.  Once created, the items continue
<br>
as if they are real.  It takes no effort to continue them once they start.
<br>
The real difficulty is making things appear or disappear, or to fly, or to
<br>
do things that normally don't happen.  It is very hard to learn to control
<br>
the dream, and the subconscious dream generating software seems to want to
<br>
keep things consistent.  I find it is easier to close my eyes in the dream
<br>
(so everything disappears), and then to visualize what I want to dream (to
<br>
make it appear), and then I open my eyes to a completely new dream
<br>
environment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am very excited about this! Although I have yet to achieve true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intentional REM lucidity (the literature does explain that such early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successes are fairly uncommon) I do believe I'm making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excellent progress.
</em><br>
<p>What you need to achieve this is to keep checking to see if you are
<br>
dreaming.  Do it now.  Keep doing it whenever you think about it.  When it
<br>
becomes enough of a habit, you will start dreaming about checking to see if
<br>
you are in a dream now.  Then you will start checking and finding yourself
<br>
in a dream more often.
<br>
<p>This test would be different for different people.  Some people perceive
<br>
dreams differently, lacking color, or something that they instantly
<br>
recognize when they check.  You can try to move objects with your mind, or
<br>
float off the floor.  Assuming that you can't do this in real life, it would
<br>
indicate a dream.  My personal trick is to see if I have continuous memory
<br>
of how I got to my current time and locations.  Dreams do not have
<br>
indefinite histories.  Right now I am at the computer, before that at lunch,
<br>
before that at work, before that in a hotel, before that driving to the
<br>
hotel, etc.  I have a whole life history up to this moment.  In a dream, I
<br>
can't remember any further back than when the dream started.  This is not my
<br>
final test, since I could start having memory problems.  If I can't remember
<br>
a continuous history to the present time, I would then start other testing.
<br>
Flying or floating is a good one for me, or closing my eyes and changing the
<br>
entire dreamscape.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1. Five days ago I could not have described a single dream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I've had in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2003, or even in the present century for that matter. Not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prior to this experiment, the only thing I could have said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for certain is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I'm reasonably sure I was indeed having dreams, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; details have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all but vanished.
</em><br>
<p>Dreams are stored in temporary memory.  The brain does not mark these
<br>
memories as important things to save, so they are ignored.  It is like
<br>
driving down the road and not remembering exactly every car you passed.  You
<br>
saw them and remembered them while you passed them, but didn't save the
<br>
memory.  Most dreams are remembered immediately upon waking and forgotten in
<br>
a few minutes.  I have tested this many times without trying to remember the
<br>
dream, I just note how many dreams I could remember.  A few minutes later
<br>
after waking up, I remember the number of dreams I just noted, but I can't
<br>
remember any dreams.
<br>
<p>To remember dreams as important, go over them in you mind when you wake up.
<br>
Act like you are telling yourself the story, and go through the sequence in
<br>
order.  Try to remember the story as if you are going to tell it to someone
<br>
else later.  You will then probably remember the story you told yourself.
<br>
Sometimes I can remember the story in my own mind's words, but cannot recall
<br>
any images or details of the dream.  In other words, I forgot the dream but
<br>
still remembered what I said it was about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; thing - my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams seem to be getting more vivid and in some ways more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disturbing. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combined with some other recurring themes lead me to believe that my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subconscious may actually be putting up some kind of concerted defense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against my conscious mind breaking through. Incredible!
</em><br>
<p>I have had similar experiences.  I concluded that my dreams were probably
<br>
always as vivid and interesting before, but that I just never remembered
<br>
them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. I have also had one poignant success at maintaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious awareness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well into the first stages of sleep. I knew I was falling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asleep, yet I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remained completely aware that my thoughts were becoming oddly random,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colors were shifting and textures were changing. Ambient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sounds were became
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hollowed out and were replaced with different sounds. The last thing I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember is a sense of complete wonder that I had never noticed these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; presumably daily events from this detached calm frame of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reference before.
</em><br>
<p>I have done this when I used to meditate.  I have gone from a waking state
<br>
into the dream state without losing consciousness or having a gap in time
<br>
(as far as I could tell).  Of course the real question was whether I really
<br>
went straight into REM sleep or whether I just went through a normal sleep
<br>
cycle and when I reached REM sleep I dreamed that I was just falling asleep.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; -  &quot;the poker hand&quot; (remembering to remain emotionally cool
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and detached the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment I first realize I have achieved success - lest the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excitement wake me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up - a commonly reported occurrence)
</em><br>
<p>This is common to wake yourself up.  This is especially true when
<br>
manipulating the dream into some exciting or specific sequence you want.
<br>
You are constantly thinking how cool it is and that you hope you don't wake
<br>
up.  I have occasionally been able to go right back to sleep and continue
<br>
the dream.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - and &quot;dream spinning&quot; (physically spinning my dream body
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around in a circle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in an effort to restore a lucid dream that appears to be fading)
</em><br>
<p>Omni magazine reported this due to surveys in the 1980's and did not have an
<br>
explanation for it.  For me, the explanation is obvious.  While spinning,
<br>
the view changes constantly.  Your subconscious dream-making subroutines
<br>
have to kick in to invent new objects and visuals as you rotate.  This helps
<br>
you focus on the dream imagery instead of your real-world sensations of
<br>
lying in bed.  I have found that going fast through scenery, watching a
<br>
changing movie, or visualizing new dream images also helps keep the dream
<br>
going.  Any focus on external sounds or feeling of lying down will switch
<br>
attention from the dream to reality and cause you to wake up.
<br>
<p>Here are some things I have tested in dreams.
<br>
1.  I do not have a photographic memory.  Trying to remember details of real
<br>
life doesn't work.  Reading a sheet of paper and trying to recite it and
<br>
memorize it in the dream results in random stuff, not what I read.
<br>
2.  I can do logical thought and produce work results in a dream.  I have
<br>
worked through engineering design problems and methodically when through
<br>
each point and devised a workable plan.  When I woke up, the entire plan was
<br>
done and workable.  The entire solution was developed while I was asleep.
<br>
Real work could be done during sleep.
<br>
3.  I can visualize very complicated scenes in dreams.  I can play chess and
<br>
maintain all the chess pieces and positions.  I have invented complicated
<br>
math problems such as long division, worked them out and memorized the
<br>
answer.  When I woke up, the answers were accurate.  I could maintain the
<br>
paper calculations and really do the math.
<br>
4.  Memory of the real world is often disrupted.  Sometimes I can't remember
<br>
what city I am in or what job I am currently working on, or the date.
<br>
5.  I have been working long hours and taken a vacation in my dreams.  I
<br>
went to the beach and relaxed without working.  Even though I worked just
<br>
before going to bed, I felt like I had time off when I woke up.  There was a
<br>
conscious memory of off-time, and I felt like going right back to work.  (Of
<br>
course sleeping overnight probably helped too.)
<br>
6.  Sometimes dreams are bogus but seem reasonable at the time.  I have had
<br>
great ideas in dreams that made perfect sense, when seemed absurd when I
<br>
woke up.
<br>
7.  I can feel pain in dreams, even though many people insist that you
<br>
can't.  I can see bright lights that get brighter.  Some people claim that
<br>
dreams are at maximum brightness or  can't increase brightness for some
<br>
reason.  I do not know if you can die in dreams, but I have simulated
<br>
falling and hitting the ground, leaving my body like an angel, losing all
<br>
sensation and pretending I was unconscious, except that I knew I was doing
<br>
it.  I'm not sure what death would be like.  I seemed to be like a cartoon
<br>
character who couldn't die.  Although I often woke up at the moment of
<br>
impact.
