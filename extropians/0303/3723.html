</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Yes. As Anders points out, these people are not anti-cloning, nor do they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have a narrow view. Both Fukuyama and Kass have stated clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and up front
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that they are pro-status-quo in terms of human capabilities. This means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;pro-death, pro-suffering, pro-disease, pro-aging (all of which,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; again, has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;been clearly stated on numerous occasions). They want there to be no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;expansion of the capabilities of mind and body on their watch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;bioethicists and hangers-on are in essence Statists, they believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that is is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;perfectly fine to use the engine of the State to coerce, force
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and impose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;In other words, they advocate and *actively work towards* mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;scale dwarfing anything that humans have &quot;achieved&quot; to date.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;As Anders also points out, they are doing a better job of killing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;us than we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are doing of staying alive at this point in time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, it's obvious that you both have given this topic FAR more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Previously I had imagined these biofundies were not a serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I couldn't see how anyone might effectively stem the tide of scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress - a perspective which predicted trans/posthumanism as the logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end result of progress. This conclusion was supported by the fact that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while Kass IS the President's chief bioethicist, funding for NBIC science
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continues unabated, and is clearly on the rise. These two facts seem to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at odds if one postulates the existence an all encompassing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technoscientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meta-policy which is the only regulatory model I could conceive of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might seriously throttle progress. That one arm of the government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is driving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress forward at breakneck speed, while another is sourly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pecking away at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the most contentious ethical issues, led me to the perhaps hasty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that such a meta-policy does not (and perhaps cannot) exist.
</em><br>
<p>The problem is not in the amounts of money redirect by government; that is a
<br>
very small fraction of source for typical large medical research efforts.
<br>
The problem is that the memes propagated by the FukuKass side of things (and
<br>
what a fun contraction that is) lead to a societal mindset that doesn't
<br>
encourage investment by the mountain of non-government money on the
<br>
sidelines. That mountain of money is largely corporate and is waiting for
<br>
the clear signs of a market in the final product.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet your words, taken in the context of the present American led drive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward near-term globalization, do indeed ring a warning. I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been forced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ask myself - might the process of evolution itself be hijacked by this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kind of irrationality?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the answer I come up with is an unsettling MAYBE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore I'm in on this fight, though sadly I'm distracted by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever-pressing need to accumulate a small quantity of those damnable social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tickets in order to alleviate such mehum concerns as food and heat, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; child size bicycle helmets. But if you are dead serious about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fighting, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it seems you are, AND if we can come up with a viable plan to mobilize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against this FukuKass mindset (polite nod to Natasha's aborted ProAct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort) which ALSO has the potential to generate a few bucks on the side,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll throw myself into it 100%.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I does seem logical to presume that more than a few corporate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities might be willing to fund this particular fight, no?
</em><br>
<p>I see getting the major corporate entities in on the research funding game;
<br>
provoking them into seeing the future market in anti-aging and regenerative
<br>
medicine is essential. Since they're generally not stupid, the best way
<br>
forward is to create that market in actual fact through awareness raising
<br>
and education.
<br>
<p>Here is my short take on it from the last two Longevity Meme
<br>
(www.longevitymeme.org) newsletters:
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
#1
<br>
<p>THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS BAD PUBLICITY
<br>
<p>Or is there? There has been some discussion on mail lists and in forums
<br>
regarding comments made by Michael Jackson during recent television spots.
<br>
The
<br>
pop star (and very rich person, according to some sources) wants to live
<br>
forever; something he briefly spoke about in a very matter-of-fact way. This
<br>
cropped up as a couple of throwaway lines in many, many articles. The
<br>
following
<br>
link is representative of many:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,11228,00.html?tnews">http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,11228,00.html?tnews</a>
<br>
<p>The actual quote:
<br>
<p>&quot;Elsewhere, in the ITV documentary, Jackson ruminates about life and
<br>
death--actually, mostly about life. Jackson's not big on dying.
<br>
<p>'I would like to live forever,' he tells Bashir.&quot;
<br>
<p>As you should all know by now, I'm very big on publicity and public
<br>
awareness
<br>
for live extension. Given the low profile that life extension has, I'm all
<br>
for
<br>
the possibility of life extension being put forth in any way in the mass
<br>
media.
<br>
<p>Was this Michael Jackson thing good, bad, or a non-event? I have no idea.
<br>
<p>I sometimes look at this whole situation from the marketing director point
<br>
of
<br>
view: life extension is a wonderful product with no downside that everyone
<br>
would
<br>
want if they only realized just how great it actually is. When you have a
<br>
product like this, you are in an enviable position: there really is no such
<br>
thing as bad publicity. If people lambaste your product as a terrible thing,
<br>
all
<br>
they are doing is spending their money to educate more of the public of the
<br>
existence of your wonderful product!
<br>
<p>That is what I would like to believe, in any case. It would make it easy to
<br>
dismiss comments of the sort that show up near the end of this Washington
<br>
Post
<br>
article:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39931-2003Feb7.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A39931-2003Feb7.html</a>
<br>
<p>Look for the section entitled &quot;The President's Ethicist.&quot; Dr. Leon Kass,
<br>
Chairman of the President's Council on Bioethics is in fine form as usual,
<br>
decrying life extension technology in any number of ways.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, we cannot dismiss Kass. While he is helping (in his own
<br>
backwards
<br>
way) to raise awareness of the possibilities of life extension, he and his
<br>
bioethicist cronies have a real ability to damage and hold back research in
<br>
the
<br>
US. He offers the justification for legislation currently under debate that
<br>
would shut down or criminalize vast swathes of anti-aging research in this
<br>
country. France has already done this: it's not as though we can pretend
<br>
that it
<br>
can't happen here.
<br>
<p>WHY IS PUBLICITY IMPORTANT?
<br>
<p>Research and research funding ebbs and flows on public awareness and public
<br>
opinion. Government funding is usually a small amount of the whole if a
<br>
field is
<br>
popular or well known. If the market sees a dollar to be made by selling
<br>
people
<br>
what they want, then companies will bloom and research funds will pour
<br>
forth.
<br>
<p>Life extension, aging and anti-aging research is currently seriously
<br>
under-funded in comparison to, say, cancer, heart disease or AIDS research.
<br>
When
<br>
you stop to think about it, this is a very strange state of affairs. After
<br>
all,
<br>
everyone ages. Almost everyone is prepared to pay money to slow or halt the
<br>
progress of aging. Witness the success of vendors claiming to supply
<br>
&quot;anti-aging&quot; products!
<br>
<p>So why is anti-aging, aging and life extension research languishing? One
<br>
answer
<br>
is that the wider public really doesn't understand the possibilities that
<br>
life
<br>
extension research could bring in the near future. This isn't an
<br>
insurmountable
<br>
barrier, however. We can look at what happened in the 80s and 90s for AIDS
<br>
research, for example. Activist groups were well aware of the possibilities
<br>
that
<br>
future research could bring. They worked long and hard, and raised a great
<br>
noise
<br>
to the heavens. Lo and behold, the flow of money to AIDS research increased
<br>
dramatically. Today, AIDS in Western countries is almost a manageable,
<br>
chronic
<br>
condition rather than a death sentence. This happened in only 20 years. When
<br>
political and economic barriers are overcome, AIDS patients elsewhere in the
<br>
world will enjoy the same benefits.
<br>
<p>So something like this could - and indeed should - happen for aging. We need
<br>
to
<br>
organize, speak up and make ourselves heard.
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
#2
<br>
<p>I spoke briefly in the last newsletter on how persistent publicity for a
<br>
cause (such as fighting AIDS or cancer research) directly influences the
<br>
amount of money flowing into that cause. In a nutshell: framing, placing and
<br>
keeping a problem front and center in mainstream culture is hard work, but
<br>
it unlocks purses far and wide. Government money is usually the least of
<br>
this; far more funding comes from venture and corporate concerns. They see
<br>
mainstream culture explicitly in terms of needs and markets for future
<br>
products. If a need is shouted loudly enough, money will be directed to
<br>
answer that need.
<br>
<p>AIDS funding in the 80s and 90s is the obvious crowning example of a victory
<br>
of activism. In a comparatively short few years, AIDS moved from obscure
<br>
disease to the center of media attention. The floodgates of research funding
<br>
opened and AIDS progressed from death sentence to manageable condition for
<br>
those with access to treatment.
<br>
<p>In 1992, when I was in the UK, the mother of my girlfriend at the time was
<br>
an academic AIDS researcher (one of the few). Activists and prominent
<br>
members of the local gay community would constantly call on her at home;
<br>
there was a very close relationship between the activists and the
<br>
researchers by that time.
<br>
<p>The point of this all is that, of course, we should be trying to do the same
<br>
thing for aging and anti-aging research. This branch of science is woefully
<br>
under-funded (largely by the government) and the major corporate concerns do
<br>
not yet see a potential market worth sinking funds into. Why is this? I
<br>
believe that it is because we don't see the loud clamor and noise of people
<br>
demanding a real cure for aging. There is no ACT UP (one of the loudest
<br>
early AIDS activism groups) to cultivate, shape, channel and present the
<br>
nascent demand for anti-aging research, medicine and technology.
<br>
<p>Active advocacy groups are the sharp tools that can only result from the
<br>
actions of a large supporting community. They don't exist in a vacuum.
<br>
Longevity Meme, Immortality Institute, Betterhumans, CR Society,
<br>
KurzweilAI.Net, Extropy Institute, World Transhumanist Association, and
<br>
other diverse pro-life-extension organizations, commentators, and online
<br>
communities didn't spring into existence from nothing. They interact with
<br>
and are encouraged and supported by diverse, overlapping communities of
<br>
people who are interested in life extension: in living healthily for longer.
<br>
This includes all of you reading this newsletter today, of course.
<br>
<p>There has been a real growth in size and sophistication of communities
<br>
interested in life extension in the past few years, largely thanks to the
<br>
power of the Internet and the actions of a core of motivated individuals
<br>
(kudos to you all). I think that we, as a community, have come to the point
<br>
of being able to say: &quot;Ok. Real, meaningful life extension is what we want.
<br>
What do we do to make it happen?&quot;
<br>
<p>TAKE ACTION
<br>
<p>Which is an interesting question. What do we do? I point you to the &quot;Take
<br>
Action&quot; page at the Immortality Institute, for example:
<br>
<a href="http://imminst.org/action/">http://imminst.org/action/</a>
<br>
<p>This page essentially advocates expanding the life extension community (in
<br>
this case, the radical life extension community). This is one of the worthy
<br>
and necessary goals of any activist. A larger life extension community can
<br>
have a larger impact on mainstream culture, and thereby on funding for
<br>
research, medicine and technology. A larger community produces more leaders
<br>
and activists.
<br>
<p>There has to be more than this, however. I would be the first to admit that
<br>
this is where those of us who seem to have become voices, leaders and
<br>
activists are falling down. We are talking up a storm, building online
<br>
communities and acting as focal points for the ideas and discussions of a
<br>
growing community. We have yet to provide the community with meaningful
<br>
suggestions and channels for activity that go beyond internal talk and
<br>
recruitment. As I pointed out above, there is no ACT UP for life extension
<br>
at the present time.
<br>
<p>I think I have talked long enough on this topic for one newsletter. Next
<br>
time, I can examine some practical ways for us to move beyond talk and
<br>
growing the community.
<br>
<p>FINAL THOUGHTS
<br>
<p>For a final thought, let's come back to growing the community. If you stop
<br>
to think about it, every extra person contributing to the life extension
<br>
community directly increases all our chances of living a much longer,
<br>
healthier life.
<br>
<p>Everyone can help, and it doesn't take much effort. Every wall is built one
<br>
brick at a time. Have you mentioned life extension to your friends today?
<br>
Show the Longevity Meme to a neighbor. Introduce someone to the Immortality
<br>
Institute. Mention Betterhumans around the office. Post these URLs or clips
<br>
of Longevity Meme articles to bulletin boards, online or on the wall of the
<br>
office. Forward this newsletter to everyone you think would like it. After
<br>
all, this is no different from sharing the normal run-of-the-mill health
<br>
advice. Go ahead! You'll be helping people.
<br>
<p>We're not a niche community anymore, and we haven't been for a while. So
<br>
let's stop behaving like one. And that's all for this newsletter. See you
<br>
next time.
