<p>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been considering Greg Burch's comment asking Samantha not to reply 
<br>
to  Ron H's post, since he apparently considers Ron's question regarding the 
<br>
positive impact on the US abroad as &quot;American nationalism&quot;. I agree to an 
<br>
extent that some discussions on various threads have been dominated by heated 
<br>
rhetoric lately, but in this instance, I must strongly disagree. Ron's 
<br>
question to Samantha was a valid point in a civilized debate. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ron, mine, the Mikes, and many other posters determination to fully have 
<br>
the record of the United States analyzed and the positive (and negative) 
<br>
accomplishments recognized and understood cannot be dismissed out of hand 
<br>
because we happen to be Americans. To not acknowledge the positive affects 
<br>
actions have had on society simply because of the National source of those 
<br>
actions IS nationalism (and tribalistic).  Not acknowledging that doctor's 
<br>
washing hands saves lives, or that some molds breed agents that kill 
<br>
bacteria, or that certain actions by certain countries have made the entire 
<br>
world a better place to live because it is a particular country is archaic, 
<br>
anti-extropian, and severely
<br>
regressive. Not acknowledging what has been done in the world to free
<br>
people from oppression, tyranny, and intolerance because of arbitrary deeply
<br>
ingrained disdain based on what some might consider half truths and 
<br>
misconceptions is unacceptable.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do not follow from lessons learned that proved positive, we can have
<br>
no chance of progressing into the future and end up stumbling blindly into
<br>
the future.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;That some people have absolutely nothing positive to say of the United
<br>
States is deplorable.  The freedoms that each and every human enjoys on this
<br>
planet (those fortunate enough to enjoy some) can all be attributed to some
<br>
degree to the United States. Yet some insist that merely because the US (or 
<br>
any other country) is powerful and in a dominant world position, than it is 
<br>
bad,  or &quot;might makes wrong&quot;, in huMania's words. This position too is not 
<br>
acceptable in any form to many on this list, and the record of the United 
<br>
States as compared to other major world powers, most notably the Soviet Union 
<br>
or Nazi Germany, is a necessary part of illustrating why the position of 
<br>
&quot;might makes wrong&quot; is not appropriate in all cases.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I will say again that I feel in some cases Greg's objections are legitimate,
<br>
since I do not consider (and have repeatedly said on this forum) that all 
<br>
foreign policy decisions made by the United States have been the correct 
<br>
ones. But regarding  the question repeatedly posed to Samantha and others, 
<br>
his objections are totally off the mark. The most important reason for this 
<br>
is that Samantha has never adequately answered that question in the many 
<br>
times Matus, Ron, I or anyone else have asked it. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illustrating that the United States helped foster and make possible 
<br>
democracy in Taiwan, Greece, South Korea, Japan, etc. is not &quot;holding up a 
<br>
slogan&quot;,  nor blind 'americanism'  it is illustrating facts that cannot be 
<br>
seriously debated, in addition to pointing out that the United States foreign 
<br>
policy is not the empty and bankrupt vessel some claim it is, ESPECIALLY when 
<br>
it is compared to other major world powers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha's  positions are totally predicated on a belief that the US has
<br>
consistently supported dictators at the expense of democracy abroad. She has 
<br>
never satisfactorily explained where all these democracies would have come 
<br>
from, or why hosts of democratic experiments failed in the third world of the 
<br>
'50s, '60s, and 70s, without the slightest hint of Cold War geopolitical 
<br>
influence, and why not one Soviet proxy became a democracy while it was 
<br>
dominated by the USSR, while a great many proxies of the United States did 
<br>
indeed develop lasting and stable democracies. It is completely legitimate 
<br>
for Ron to ask that she back up what many would consider a flawed position 
<br>
with more than &quot;the history is out there.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Democracy and freedom are quite extropic, and thus the United States has 
<br>
done more to spread EXTROPIAN ideals than any other nation in the world. This 
<br>
is not nationalism or blind patriotism, it is a statement of fact, an 
<br>
observation based in reality. To assert otherwise is intellectually dishonest.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Iraq&quot; talk in no way prevents people from posting on (in their view) more
<br>
&quot;Extropic&quot; topics.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
