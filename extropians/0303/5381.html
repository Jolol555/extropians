<em>&gt; Such rot.
</em><br>
<p>I will run the risk of stating the obviuos from a memetic context:
<br>
<p>The younger &amp; hungrier Right Wing Talk Zealots do get cranked up a lot-- 
<br>
their producers and agents want them to stay in the 
<br>
&quot;shock&quot;/controversy/polarization zone. It gains them market from 
<br>
controvery's first-order (curiosity/first time listeners) and second-order 
<br>
(polarity stimulation of the susceptible part of the listener base+mores 
<br>
stations subscribed) effects. Controversy as free advertising for stim 
<br>
junkies. Pandering, actually. Like the historical Joe Pyne or the fictional 
<br>
[Bug] Jack Barron. It really is more than a bit like the WWF.
<br>
<p>The pandering of some other media sources is more indirect and less 
<br>
blatant. Not enough arsenic to kill you with one sip.
<br>
<p>Hannity is interesting to me personally because he's a fresh revanchiste- 
<br>
conservative [e.g. &quot;Q.: Has affirmative action gone too far?&quot;] secular 
<br>
Catholic getting air time; for a long time Bill Buckley was the only one-- 
<br>
and Buckley is, as has been mentioned, at least rational enough to advocate 
<br>
seriously countenancing ending the WoSD. Hannity gives me a read on a 
<br>
population segment of interest to me with which I am otherwise not in 
<br>
contact. My roots, sort of.
<br>
<p>Yes, over a fairly low threshold, the squeaky wheel gets ignored--while one 
<br>
winces from the splitting headache. Hannity is not Jack Kennedy or Eric 
<br>
Sevareid, for damn sure. But he's not the far end of my personal  
<br>
fingernails-on-chalkboard scale. I can usually stand about ten minutes of 
<br>
Hannity, thirty seconds of Michael Savage (radio right gunslinger trying 
<br>
for out-Rush Rush Limbaugh), and six seconds of Senator Charles Schumer 
<br>
(who occupies the other side of some scale of mine, not exactly Left/Right) 
<br>
. Six seconds is my limit for watching the WWF smackdowns, too.
<br>
<p>MMB, donning anti-radation garb
