<em>&gt; First of all let me put my political cards on the table:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1. Rachel Corey was most likely my political opposite. I'm sure we'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learn as this story develops that she subscribed to some sort of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collectivist, statist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology, and that she had a history of anti-American sentiment that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some on this list would doubtless describe as knee-jerk.
</em><br>
<p>She is, after all, from Olympia, Washington. I'll be she is a graduate
<br>
of Evergreen State College, pot-head and left-wingnut HQ for the entire
<br>
Northwestern US.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2. She deliberately put herself in harm's way, and became a contender
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for 2003's Darwin Awards result.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That being said, it is still an undisputed fact that an Israeli Army
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bulldozer crushed to death an American citizen engaged in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nonviolent, unarmed, political protest. When someone like Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein does that to &quot;his own&quot; citizens, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; add that to the long list of reasons justifying his ouster.
</em><br>
<p>What she did was make herself an enemy combatant by acting as a human
<br>
shield for illegal combatant members of a terrorist guerrilla
<br>
insurgency. What SHE did is a war crime, and her Palestinian hosts are
<br>
similarly and specifically war criminals for allowing her to do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What do we about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign government killing one of &quot;our own&quot; citizens?
</em><br>
<p>When she decided to be party to a war crime, she placed herself outside
<br>
the bounds of our protection. Under the Geneva Conventions, her
<br>
Palestinian hosts can be summarily executed for allowing her to engage
<br>
in the activities which got her killed. The Israeli soldier driving the
<br>
bulldozer cannot be held at fault whatsoever. THIS is how the Geneva
<br>
Conventions work.
