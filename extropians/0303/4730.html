<br>
good heuristic. One that comes to mind is the fact that I want to ignore 
<br>
trolls with greater efficiency rather than call for their banning, suing, 
<br>
fining, jailing, flogging, etc. Also, this medium isn't terribly conducive to 
<br>
someone who doesn't believe in free speech, don't you think?
<br>
<p>Alex,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you have just sat yourself upon a pedestal without 
<br>
justification.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, let me dispose of a minor personal matter.  You dare ask me 
<br>
what I think of the American Indian Movement.  If you listened at all you 
<br>
would know I am a part blood Cherokee.  The other questions you asked are 
<br>
almost as insulting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, if you were really interested in dealing with trolls you would 
<br>
ask Natasha or her designee to check the various threads you object to see 
<br>
who initiates them.  I don't think any of the people that I ordinarily agree 
<br>
with ever initiate a single political or off topic thread -- I know I don't.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have to assume that your real concern is not that me or any of my 
<br>
friends are trolls.  Your problem is that you or the folks you agree with 
<br>
initiate threads and then get them thoroughly refuted much to your chagrin.  
<br>
Quit initiating those political, current events and off extropian topics and 
<br>
the refutations will cease.  That is the nature of the beast.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you do that you will win my thanks.  You are allowing threads to be 
<br>
initiated that frankly waste my time but which are so radical they cannot go 
<br>
unanswered.  I would much rather be engaged in Extropian subjects whether as 
<br>
a writer or as a lurker.
<br>
Ron H.
