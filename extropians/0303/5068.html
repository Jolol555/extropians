<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, you just will not give me, and indeed many others, credit for 
<br>
having the intelligence to see through your little tactics.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Humania, you have as a goal the financial aggrandisement of your 
<br>
country and the promotion of you favorite form of a totalitarian government.  
<br>
You apparently believe that if you can see the US defeated that event will in 
<br>
someway advance your cause.  Further you seem to think you can talk Americans 
<br>
and others into helping you.
<br>
be of good cheer,
<br>
Ron h.
