<p>Charles, It is very easy to prove that Richard Nixon was unlovely.  He is so 
<br>
unlovely that attacking him on that grounds is almost like shooting ducks in 
<br>
a barrel -- it is distinctly unsportsmanlike.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in Navy Flight School Richard Nixon's brother Edward Nixon 
<br>
was temporarily attached to my class early in the program.  As I was the 
<br>
Cadet Class Commander I came to know him fairly well.  A finer gentleman nor 
<br>
a smarter man has rarely lived.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Initially I equated Richard and Edward Nixon.  That was to the 
<br>
advantage of Richard.  But all in all the only flaw I have found in my 
<br>
reading about the man was that Richard Nixon was unlovely.  He committed the 
<br>
sin of repeatedly stomping his democrat party opponents and was never 
<br>
forgiven.  Being unlovely he was easy to drown in trash talk.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However that is all totally off the point.  I asked a factual question 
<br>
-- does anyone have any evidence about the attorney I referred to?
<br>
Ron h.
<br>
<p>Just to cover all the bases.  No, I have never met Richard Nixon nor ever 
<br>
discussed him with his brother Edward.  I only knew Edward in Navy Flight 
<br>
School.  A conversation about his brother would have been totally out of 
<br>
line.
