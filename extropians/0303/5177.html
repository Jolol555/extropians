<em>&gt;Hi Natasha.  Do you happen to know whether that site is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;balanced or not?  Have you listened to it?
</em><br>
<p>Most political sites are not reasonably balanced.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm glad that Damien posted a news story that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reported Iraqi casualties.  I do not want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that only American lives are important.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Shudder.  Yes.  Absolutely all the truths must
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and should come out.  Our tempest in a teapot
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was a rather arcane matter of subtle etiquette
</em><br>
<em>&gt;IMO.  A completely separate post by him or anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt;else wouldn't have caused the slightest objection
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from me, that's for sure!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But it does bring up the question of the mindset of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those---no one I know of, especially on Extropians
</em><br>
<em>&gt;---who would think human lives unimportant so long
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as they were &quot;the enemy&quot;, or belonged to a &quot;subhuman&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;or despised ethnic group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suppose that it had evolutionary advantages at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;point in the past to see others as not &quot;the people&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Hopefully, we are beyond that in most ways.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The second point about this is why are the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt;soldier casualties and the Iraqi civilian and soldier
</em><br>
<em>&gt;casualties of more concern than, say, the approximately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one-hundred fatalities on America's highways each day?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think that there *is* a good explanation for this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but it takes work, and I'll answer another time.
</em><br>
<p>Probably because the threads have been about war and the consequences of 
<br>
war rather than the unsafe machinery people use for transportation and 
<br>
mobility.  50 years, if not sooner, people will look back on automobiles 
<br>
and the deaths caused by them in horror that we were so vulnerable in these 
<br>
motor transports and accepted it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For that matter, a third point is &quot;why are the lives
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of non-combatants often assumed to be more valuable
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than the lives of young soldiers?&quot;.  I'm afraid that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone who thinks that the death of a soldier is okay,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but that the death of a civilian is somehow worse is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;laboring under the delusion that war is some sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;game, and certain people have signed up to play.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think civilians lives are more or less important.  There seems to 
<br>
be more compassion and sympathy for bystanders because they are not hired 
<br>
military and therefore third party.  Soldiers usually agree to 
<br>
fight.  Civilians usually do not.
<br>
<p>best,
<br>
<p>Natasha
