<br>
<em>&gt; Harvey, thanks for your lengthy and encouraging reply. I had hoped for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something along those lines, but wasn't necessarily expecting it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wow! So you've had (more or less) controlled access to this &quot;alternate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality&quot; since you were four years old huh? What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frequency of your lucid dreams now then?
</em><br>
<p>I rarely remember dreaming unless I choose to.  About half the time I wake
<br>
up knowing that I have dreamed, but I don't bother trying to
<br>
memorize/remember them so they fade and I can't remember them later.  I have
<br>
a lucid dream about once a week when I'm not trying, and almost always have
<br>
one per night when I am trying.  Now that I think about it, I don't recall
<br>
ever having more than one lucid dream per night.  I am not sure if this is
<br>
some sort of limitation or if I don't try again after the first one.
<br>
<p>I used to be more into new age spirituality and would use lucid dreaming to
<br>
conjure up guides to answer questions for me.  Even when I decided that
<br>
these were just my subconscious mind, it was interesting to query dream
<br>
characters for answers, knowing that the answers came from my mind
<br>
somewhere, even if I wasn't conscious of it.  When I used to do this, I
<br>
would often have a specific reason to have a lucid dream and control the
<br>
conversation in the dream.  Under these circumstances, I almost always had a
<br>
lucid dream the first thing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I've had maybe four or five in my entire life in which, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever reason,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realized that I was dreaming and so I could proceed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explore or assert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my wishes with abandon. It has been many years since the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still recall that it was a highly empowering, emotionally satisfying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience.
</em><br>
<p>It is an amazing sense of control and power.  In the dream, the entire
<br>
universe seems real.  But when you can control the entire universe, it is
<br>
amazing.  It is exactly like being in a Star Trek holodeck where you can
<br>
make anything you want.  Except that it does take will power and mind
<br>
concentration.  A lot of times it is difficult to make things fly around or
<br>
appear and disappear.  I think the subconscious dream mechanisms try to
<br>
suppress non-sequitur or unrealistic dream occurrences and try to make a
<br>
continuous logic flow out of the dream.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I remember reading somewhere that Osama Bin Laden and his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cronies placed an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unusually high value on the interpretation of dreams and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think at the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I said something to myself along the lines of: Wow, how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incredibly stupid.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, this is quite common in any religion where the deity is not
<br>
directly visible and only communicates internally to those who pray,
<br>
meditate, and interpret hidden signs not perceived by others.  Christianity
<br>
places as much emphasis in dreams as Islam and many other religions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, say if in a series of lucid dreams - and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gets back to what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you said about doing useful work while dreaming - one were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; practice, in the absence of usual crippling fear, smashing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel laden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airliner into a building. And every time, just as the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fireball slaps you in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the face, you wake up safe and sound in your own bed. I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess that after a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few practice runs of this nature, you'd become fairly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; confident you had &quot;the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right stuff&quot; to get the job done in the real world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Essentially, you'd know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from past experience that you wouldn't be one to veer off at the last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible moment and make a bee-line for tea and scrumpets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Saddam or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moammar Quadaffi.
</em><br>
<p>Practice is the key to any training, whether it is military, sports, dance,
<br>
art, logic, or anything else.  Going through the steps over and over makes
<br>
one better.  It has even been shown that sports players who visualize their
<br>
moves over and over improve more than those who don't practice or visualize.
<br>
Even though they aren't gaining the physical muscular feedback of the moves,
<br>
they are practicing the steps, sequences and strategy over and over in their
<br>
mind.  Your point about avoiding fear is especially true.  Going through
<br>
something in simulation, dreams, or just on paper will make it easier than
<br>
facing it the first time unprepared.  After enough practice, even the most
<br>
horrific acts can become mundane routine and common place.
