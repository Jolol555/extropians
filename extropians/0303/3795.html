</em><br>
<em>&gt; artillery shell. In fact, I think the U.S. should personalize each and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every bomb, give it it's own URL and let children post messages which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be printed via some sort of hand-held dot-matrix printer on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; munition as it's loaded. Combine this with the camera on the bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmitting it's last image so you could actually match up individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dead Iraqis with the bomb that killed them. Then the kids could write
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqi widows and orphans explaining why their husbands and fathers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had to die, and it'd all be archived for future historians.
</em><br>
<p>Of all the self-serving load of crap I've ever heard!  You wish to
<br>
impugn your ideological adversaries with the worst possible set of
<br>
motives.  This ridicule ultimately will make you look to be he who
<br>
is ridiculous.  It's as if you have no concept at all of the trade-
<br>
offs involved.  It's as though you think these decisions are trivial,
<br>
and it's simply a question of life vs. death.
<br>
<p>Get this: it is a trade-off of death vs. death, now and in the
<br>
future.  To bow to the will of a tyrant, to let him or any other
<br>
megalomaniac amass as many weapons of mass destruction as they
<br>
please, to permit him and others like him to hold their victims
<br>
under their thumbs, torturing, imprisoning, and killing them
<br>
forever---that is what is not an option.
<br>
<p>Hubert adds---also taking the easy route of ridicule instead of
<br>
engaging in carefully thought-out analysis---
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What a  bunch of terrific ideas! Now wouldn't that be fun. Finally we would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all be happily  engaged in a global war game. The American kids counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smashed bodies and give the deadly wounded Iraqi babies a remote control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coup de grace. And finally: Computerized bombs, shells and bullets would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give us Militant Pacifists (MP) the chance to hack into the system and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate the bombs on their flight or maybe with some cool hacker tools
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reverse their ballistic curve and direct them straight back to the shooters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which I would definitely prefer besides teaching Iraqi children to write to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the widows and orphans weeping back home in &quot;God's Own Country&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explaining how MPs managed to turn a tool of war against the aggressor.
</em><br>
<p>Tell me *exactly* how well you think such toys, depicting the horrible
<br>
cruelties of war will sell in the war-mongering vicious imperialistic
<br>
United States of your imagination.  Let's have the figures!  Also
<br>
describe to me how war is glorified in the schools, in parades, and
<br>
in mass rallies in the U.S.
<br>
<p>You are perfectly and absolutely correct to keep in mind all the funerals
<br>
that will attend the many thousands who will die.  This is the reality!
<br>
Joseph Stalin for once in his life said something very wise:  &quot;The death
<br>
of each Russian soldier is a tragedy, but the death of a million is a
<br>
statistic.&quot;  What we must never forget is that however difficult it is
<br>
for our puny imaginations, a million tragedies is exactly a million times
<br>
worse that one.
<br>
<p>Future history depends on us, just as surely as past history depended
<br>
on our predecessors.  Had they not had the courage and good sense to
<br>
make intelligent (though often painful) decisions, we'd be living under
<br>
the tyranny of a Hitler or Stalin or Mao Zedong even now.
<br>
<p>The parallels to World War II are completely inappropriate in almost
<br>
all ways.  But in 1936 some officers in the French army---some of those
<br>
&quot;right-wing lunatics, super-patriots&quot; that you would be so quick to
<br>
denounce---said, &quot;The Germans are re-arming, and they're now under
<br>
a crazed dictator.  Let's go get them NOW!&quot;
<br>
<p>And in 1936, nothing, absolutely nothing could have stopped the 
<br>
French army, vastly, vastly more powerful than the German one,
<br>
from taking Berlin in a matter of days.  But did anyone listen
<br>
to these &quot;crazy war-mongers&quot;, these &quot;super-patriots&quot; who felt
<br>
their country to be in danger?  No!  It was necessary to obtain
<br>
&quot;peace in our time&quot;.  No price was too great to pay for reward
<br>
of peace.  No risk was too great to take for the sake of peace.
<br>
And no one in any position of authority in France listened to
<br>
their arguments, or had the good judgment to see that they were
<br>
exactly right.  And the world lost 55 million lives as a result.
<br>
<p>That's FIFTY-FIVE MILLION.  Get it?  That's exactly a thousand
<br>
times as many as needed to be.  Think of those millions of funerals
<br>
yourself, and imagine the calumny with which you would probably
<br>
be attacking France at this very moment, as it (instead of the U.S.)
<br>
took out crazed dictators building weapons and threatening the
<br>
democracies.  You would never forget France's &quot;imperialism&quot;, and
<br>
how they had snuffed out socialism in Germany, and the courageous
<br>
leader who had dared to resist the imperialists.
<br>
<p>Next think about the MILLIONS that ARE GOING TO DIE inevitably
<br>
in the near future as terrorists and nations sponsoring terrorism
<br>
perfect their weapons, and sense the weakness of the democracies.
<br>
Think of the funerals of those *millions* of people, and then
<br>
remember that we have a chance, just as those French politicians
<br>
did once so long ago, of delaying, perhaps forever, the truly
<br>
frightful holocausts.
