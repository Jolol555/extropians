<em>&gt;Charles, It is very easy to prove that Richard Nixon was unlovely.  He is so

Sorry.  I don't know the attorney you are referring to.  If you have an 
<br>
exact quote, or his name, I could google for him (as could you), but 
<br>
barring that...  Various people made various statements at various times 
<br>
for various reasons during the proceedings.  I can easily believe that 
<br>
at some point an attorney made a statement indicating that there was a 
<br>
problem collecting evidence (the reason I thought the web page 
<br>
relevant).  This doesn't speak to why they said it, when they said it, 
<br>
or what they found out later.  And I find his &quot;great sin&quot; (as a matter 
<br>
of imagery) not his treatment of his political opponents, but of the 
<br>
people who didn't have power.  But his great crime was betrayal of his 
<br>
oath of office.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Just to cover all the bases.  No, I have never met Richard Nixon nor ever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;discussed him with his brother Edward.  ...
