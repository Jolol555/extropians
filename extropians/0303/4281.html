<em>&gt;  In my experience liberal is a term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that socialist apply to themselves to disguise who they really are. Are you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggesting that the Americans will attempt to turn the Iraqi into a bunch of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic socialists?
</em><br>
<p>Why not? One of the things Thomas Friedman mentioned on the lecture (on 
<br>
CSPAN) was that Iraq might be the 'arab yugoslavia', in which the 
<br>
dictatorship is *necessary* to keep the various ethnic groups from 
<br>
killing each other. I've see mentions of 'supervised labor' for 
<br>
(otherwise not gainfully employed) youth. There's no way it's gonna be a 
<br>
democracy right off, as they really want (for some reason) to keep the 
<br>
country together when it seems it might be better off as three 
<br>
mini-states. (And a federation is one model that's been discussed). I 
<br>
can see the government remaining much the same (especially since they're 
<br>
gonna use the buracracy and army). I think any real democracy would be 
<br>
far off. Maybe never, as it'd have to be restored here first :-)
<br>
<p>Since the country's population is half kids, it seems some sort of soft 
<br>
revolution might happen when these folks start getting tons of 
<br>
cellphones and internet access. Might be kind of cool actually, and I'd 
<br>
tend toward supporting the war if the US had a halfway competent 
<br>
administration.
<br>
<p>15 year olds are idealistic anyways, so why not a few years/decades of 
<br>
socialism? Along with the 'supervised labor' they could spy on their 
<br>
parents. Get 'em nicely domesticated it'll take them years to realize 
<br>
they're getting screwed by the US/UK oil companies now running the place.
