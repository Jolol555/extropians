<p>
Another justification for patents can be expressed in terms of transaction
<br>
costs.  If there were no patents, people might try to protect their
<br>
innovations in other ways that could be quite expensive.  They could
<br>
wrap their devices in elaborate self-destruct mechanisms, for example.
<br>
Or they might reveal the workings to customers, but only in exchange
<br>
for a promise by the customer not to use the information or reveal it
<br>
to anyone else.
<br>
<p>Needless to say, such contracts would be very difficult and expensive to
<br>
enforce.  The transaction costs would be extremely high.  So the patent
<br>
system can be seen as a substitute for privately-negotiated contracts
<br>
like this, a sort of default contract which inventors can choose to make
<br>
use of.  Or they can always try to protect their secrets in one of these
<br>
other ways.
<br>
<p>The justification is then that if we did not have patents, inventors
<br>
would waste everyone's time, energy and money coming up with other ways
<br>
to protect their ideas.  Patents would therefore reduce transaction
<br>
costs and make society run more efficiently.
<br>
<p>It is interesting to observe how we are starting to see the results
<br>
of transaction costs falling for other private methods of protecting
<br>
intellectual property.  The much-maligned Palladium technology from
<br>
Microsoft can be seen as a way of enforcing the kinds of agreements
<br>
discussed above, with regard to copyright.  You will only be able to
<br>
download a movie, say, if you in effect agree to observe certain rules
<br>
in terms of handling the data.  Palladium technology is designed to
<br>
lower transaction costs to the point where these kinds of contracts
<br>
can be efficient on a wide scale.  It can be seen as an alternative to
<br>
copyright that is non-coercive and relies solely on private agreements.
<br>
<p>I have supported Palladium on other forums, and been roundly criticized
<br>
for it (even by some members of this group).  In fact I have been called
<br>
an idiot (actually I think it was &quot;intelligent idiot&quot;), a stooge for
<br>
Microsoft, and many other names.  In part this is because I chose to
<br>
present my ideas without attachment to my name or reputation, so that
<br>
they would stand or fall on their own.  (They failed very thoroughly,
<br>
an interesting object lesson in the practical importance of reputation.)
<br>
<p>In any case I still hope that Palladium and similar technology experiments
<br>
proceed and are allowed to compete in the marketplace with a wide variety
<br>
of other approaches to handling intellectual property.  It would certainly
<br>
be preferable philosophically to find a way to encourage innovation and
<br>
creativity without having the heavy hand of government forcing people
<br>
to honor contracts to which they had not agreed, as is effectively the
<br>
case with current patent and copyright laws.
