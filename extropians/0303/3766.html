</em><br>
<p>Exactly. How do you teach mathematics (say group theory or
<br>
multidimensional analysis) on video? You can certainly visualize
<br>
examples (which is good), but each example will be just an example. The
<br>
drawback of video and other visual mediums is that they are particular,
<br>
the things we see are more concrete than the abstractions of writing.
<br>
And in many fields it is the abstractions that are important. 
<br>
Speech/writing, being linear, always runs at a high abstraction level. 
<br>
The best symbolic art and visualisation still works by showing a 
<br>
concrete example of something, which we then try to interpret as a 
<br>
generality rather than a particularity - something which requires a 
<br>
great deal of skill from the artist and a quite extensive understanding 
<br>
from the viewer. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Our minds will change and eventually learn to accept information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in video form as well as we do in written form.
</em><br>
<p>Quite likely. There is a generational difference in image comprehension, 
<br>
it seems. But that people can comprehend complex information in a 
<br>
certain medium doesn't make it generally better at conveying *all* 
<br>
information. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The alphabet is Primitive.  Only 26 letters for English.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's time to move on.
</em><br>
<p>One can always imagine extending it, and that usually shows the problem. 
<br>
I guess English would need the double amount of letters to cover all 
<br>
phonemes. Now each letter is a sound, but the expressiveness has not 
<br>
changed and it is slightly harder to learn. One could try to make 
<br>
Speedtalk a la Heinlein, but that just means that one sacrifices 
<br>
redundancy and learnability for brevity, no new linguistic abilities.
<br>
<p>I would like to add hypertext and better stacks to language. But that 
<br>
requires improvements in the listener, rather than language itself. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Quite often, videos and CDs do enhance understanding.  &quot;A picture
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is worth a thousand words.&quot;  But an equally great truth, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not an opposite is, &quot;A word can be worth a thousand pictures.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How many pictures would it take to convey &quot;expropriate&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;contemptible&quot;, or &quot;increasing rarefaction&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Or a C^2-&gt;C^2 function or the set of all morphisms?
<br>
<p>We can take advantage of the different levels of complexity. Writing and
<br>
speech are linear, low bandwidth but high abstraction (writing somewhat
<br>
more than speech, since one gets a memory enhancement tool in the paper
<br>
and can even go 2D if needed). Images has higher bandwidth and a lower 
<br>
level of abstraction, while video is even higher in bandwidth and 
<br>
concreteness. Maybe we should try to invent further information channels 
<br>
for other purposes?
