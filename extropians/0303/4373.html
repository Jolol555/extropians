<br>
<p>&quot;I should have stated my meaning and standpoint more clearly. From My casual 
<br>
observation and those of the 'general public&quot; types that I have spoken to. 
<br>
Nixon is viewed as somewhat a loon who broke the law while in office. 
<br>
Granted, he also achieved a great deal and these achievements are greatly 
<br>
overshadowed by the events at the end of his Presidency. 
<br>
I will admit that I am far from an expert on the subject as I was too young 
<br>
to care at the time and today it really does not interest me a great deal as 
<br>
I live in the UK. This may go far in explaining my viewpoint or may just be 
<br>
fuel for an Ad-Hominem attack.&quot;
<br>
<p>It does elaborate on your viewpoint, which as I said is what I expected. I 
<br>
would merely suggest that Nixon is viewed as &quot;somewhat of a loon&quot; to many 
<br>
people in this country who held that point of view of him even before any of 
<br>
the Watergate affair began. 
<br>
<p>&quot;My view of the current President is that he was not elected by the people 
<br>
and should never have made it to the white house.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would respectfully disagree with this position. As Lee illustrated, the 
<br>
popular vote has never been the final arbiter of decision in an American 
<br>
election. (Again, the aforementioned Nixon won the largest popular vote 
<br>
margin of all time in 1972, and that didn't save him from a Congress with a 
<br>
lynch mob mentality) President Bush clearly won the election in the system we 
<br>
have. Perhaps it wouldn't have come down to the &quot;messy&quot; ending had Mr. Gore 
<br>
not initially attempted to have only the votes recounted in three heavily 
<br>
Democratic counties in Florida, especially when he was espousing a mantra of 
<br>
&quot;count all the votes&quot;. Given that New Mexico was even closer than Florida at 
<br>
that point, it concerned me that he was not interested in truly having &quot;all 
<br>
the votes counted&quot;, but merely the ones that he thought would have put 
<br>
himself in the White House. It is not my intention to reopen or rekindle the 
<br>
flames of debate regarding the 2000 election, I merely mean to illustrate 
<br>
that neither side is completely isolated from the charges and accusations 
<br>
regarding their conduct.  
<br>
<p>&quot;This is all an aside as my original post was simply a question as to &quot;how do 
<br>
you remove a person from elected office in the US?&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me say that is certainly true, however, since you chose to include what 
<br>
some might call an &quot;inflammatory&quot; comment regarding President Nixon, I felt 
<br>
that characterization was up for debate. As Lee has subsequently illustrated, 
<br>
there are methods that can be used to remove a public official before his 
<br>
term expires. But let's be fair, in the United States, this removal is almost 
<br>
always due to some sort of corruption/ illegal financial gain. It is not 
<br>
based on, say, a President inflicting mass murder/torture on his people. So 
<br>
let us be clear in illustrating the merits of this system as opposed to 
<br>
Saddam Hussein's Iraq.
<br>
<p>&quot;My question was in order to give me a better understanding of what safety 
<br>
guards are in place to stop someone like Any President from doing something 
<br>
utterly mad? For example, breaking international law, Illegally invading 
<br>
another country or even forcing the country to follow a course of action that 
<br>
is against the wishes of the majority of the public and could conceivably 
<br>
start a second cold war.&quot;
<br>
<p>I think Lee answered these queries quite well in his post, but I will touch 
<br>
on a few of them. To touch on international law, and more to the point the 
<br>
UN, let me say this. The Korean War was fought under the auspices of the UN 
<br>
ONLY because the Soviet Union was boycotting the body because of the US led 
<br>
effort to block Mao Zedong's People's Republic of China from taking the seat 
<br>
of Jiang Jieshi's government on Taiwan. Had the USSR been present, then they 
<br>
would have vetoed the resolution endorsing action against the North Koreans. 
<br>
(Yes, this is obvious, given that the Soviets were bankrolling the North 
<br>
Koreans and North Korean dictator Kim Il Sung actually went to Joseph Stalin 
<br>
for permission to invade beforehand). So, my question would then be would you 
<br>
now be criticizing President Truman's decision to save the South Koreans from 
<br>
the tyranny of the North because he would have broken &quot;international law&quot;?
<br>
<p>To the point about &quot;illegally invading a country&quot;, I would offer that this 
<br>
appears to be a phenomenon that is reserved by its critics for the United 
<br>
States. Just to use Nixon's administration as an example, he was (and 
<br>
continues to be) unfairly criticized for &quot;illegal operations in Cambodia.&quot; 
<br>
Now, the neutrality of Cambodia was established in the 1954 Geneva Accords, 
<br>
an agreement that was not endorsed by the United States but was by the North 
<br>
Vietnamese. Yet, the US is criticized for attacking the NORTH VIETNAMESE in 
<br>
Cambodia, five years after the NVA began trampling the sovereignty of that 
<br>
nation! If universal standards are not going to be held for the conduct of 
<br>
ALL COUNTRIES, which they are not, then this concept is meaningless.
<br>
<p>I would again say that I felt Lee answered your question on public opinion 
<br>
well. It is not logical for the President of the United States to base his 
<br>
decisions that will impact not only us now living but future generations by 
<br>
how the wind is blowing in Peoria today. To use Nixon as an illustration, in 
<br>
1971, 90 plus percent of the American public would not have known Chinese 
<br>
Premier Zhou Enlai from a Sloppy Joe. So I don't think it particularly wise 
<br>
for a President to engage in foreign policy decisions based on the mob 
<br>
mentality of an (unfortunately) largely uninformed group. The public opposed 
<br>
entering World War II until December 7th. They consistently opposed action in 
<br>
Korea. Their judgements are constantly shifting and changing by what they see 
<br>
in two minute soundbites on the evening news. Roosevelt, Truman, and Nixon 
<br>
all deserve tremendous amounts of credit in those instances for guiding 
<br>
public opinion, not being a slave to it.
<br>
<p>In terms of your opinion of Bush's actions beginning a second Cold War, I'd 
<br>
be curious if you would be willing to elaborate on them further. In terms of 
<br>
with who and what dynamic you would foresee the world alliances taking. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Glean from this question what you will. Undoubtedly I am against the war in 
<br>
Iraq. However this does not by definition make me Anti American or Pro 
<br>
Saddam, far from it.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I am not sure who this comment is addressed to. I at no point have accused 
<br>
you of any of these charges. It is obvious that we disagree in regard to 
<br>
action against Saddam Hussein. But it has always been my feeling that healthy 
<br>
debate can occur on the topic even if two people's opinions are 180 degrees 
<br>
apart.
