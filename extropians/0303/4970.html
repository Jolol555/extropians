<p>
It is now a fact that the top 50% of wage earners in the US pay over
<br>
96% of income taxes. Despite the fact that this link is at Rush
<br>
Limbaughs website, I have found its numbers to be accurate. I am using
<br>
it because it is in an easily emailed format.
<br>
<a href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/menu/irsfigures.guest.html">http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/menu/irsfigures.guest.html</a>
<br>
<p>I have included the raw data at the end of this post.
<br>
<p>What is interesting is what is signified by a person at the 50
<br>
percentile level, which in 2000 was a little over $27,000. The Constant
<br>
Dollars data shows that the trend through the 80's and early 90's of
<br>
real income decay is ended.
<br>
<p>The key point that Rush was making in presenting this data, and which
<br>
I've made here on occasion, is that claims by the left that the GOP is
<br>
only for tax cuts for the rich is a false argument, because the 'rich'
<br>
as defined by the left, are the only people who pay the taxes in the
<br>
first place. However, one interesting thing is that this seems to have
<br>
always been the case. The figures for 1986 show that the top 50% paid
<br>
around 94% of all income tax. It seems to appear that welfare reform
<br>
didn't shift so many people off the welfare roles as much as automated
<br>
and deregulated the welfare system, as well as making it more equitable
<br>
and progressive. You no longer have to be unemployed to be on welfare.
<br>
<p>Why this data is as it is can be shown by comparing the figures to the
<br>
thresholds for the Earned Income Tax credit, which cuts off at around
<br>
$31,000. If you aren't paying taxes, you are on welfare, is essentially
<br>
the argument, and large percentages of the income of the top 50% is
<br>
being redistributed via the EITC to the lower 50%. 
<br>
<p>On the positive side, this is taking place without some onerous
<br>
bureaucracy of social workers, means testers, and fraud investigators
<br>
parasitizing on top. You get or give a check based on your income,
<br>
point blank. The computer network takes care of all of it. There are no
<br>
rules that disqualify you if you own a car or have some savings or
<br>
investments, or are self employed.
<br>
<p>On the negative side, it imposes a stark polarity onto society that
<br>
translates to the political arena. If you get a check from the
<br>
government, and you have dependents, you are more likely to vote for
<br>
the candidates that are going to keep that money coming in. If you pay
<br>
a check to the government, you are more likely to vote for candidates
<br>
that are going to minimize that check as much as possible.
<br>
<p>With the 50 percentile level at $27,000 and the cutoff for the EITC
<br>
around $4,000 higher than that, this means that more than 50% of
<br>
American workers are on welfare. This bodes ill for libertarian hopes
<br>
when more than half the populace is on the government dole.
<br>
<p>What is also interesting is that the top 1% pay about a third of all
<br>
income taxes. They can't help but benefit the most from tax cuts,
<br>
unless a tax cut is unfairly targeted to only to expand that 53% that
<br>
is on welfare and paying no income taxes whatsoever. 
<br>
<p>It is a fine box that tax cutters are in. If you evenly apply a tax
<br>
cut, the rich get the most benefit, and the EITC payouts to the sub-53%
<br>
may get reduced. If you cut other taxes, like the payroll tax (i.e.
<br>
social security), you get whacked for messing with the 'third rail of
<br>
American politics' and you still come out looking like a meany, picking
<br>
on old people.
<br>
<p>Given that there is no longer a surplus, the idea of any tax cut
<br>
passing has zero glide time. It is mated on the strategy board until
<br>
such time as the rook of revinues backs off once again, and technology
<br>
provides expanding revinue pictures once again. The fact that so few
<br>
businesses are upgrading their systems and software (and so little new
<br>
versions of software provide any measurable productivity increases)
<br>
bodes ill for this possibility in the near future.
<br>
<p>Ah, dynamic scoring, you say. The difficulty is that dynamic scoring
<br>
presents an ever expanding locus of possible future revinues, as anyone
<br>
who viewed the coverage of the congressional tax cut hearings in 2001
<br>
can attest. Furthermore, it can't fortell future events like 9/11,
<br>
which has rather seriously changed the entire revinue dynamic for years
<br>
to come. It also has difficulty dealing with false data in the market,
<br>
like Enron. Who thinks they are the Muad'dib who can sift the timelines
<br>
to find the true future?
<br>
<p>Read on..

[1] The number of returns with negative adjusted gross income, i.e.,
<br>
returns with an adjusted gross deficit, and the corresponding amounts
<br>
for adjusted gross deficit, were excluded from Table 1. By excluding
<br>
deficit returns, alternative minimum tax reported on some of these
<br>
returns was also excluded. For Tax Year 2000, there were 5,714 returns
<br>
with no adjusted gross income that reported income tax, mostly
<br>
alternative minimum tax, totaling $100.6 million. 
<br>
[2] For Table 1, constant dollars were calculated using the U.S. Bureau
<br>
of Labor Statistics' consumer price index for urban consumers (CPI-U,
<br>
1982-84=100). For 2000 the CPI-U = 172.2 
<br>
[3] Total income tax is the sum of income tax after credits and
<br>
alternative minimum tax reported on returns that showed a positive
<br>
amount for adjusted gross income. Therefore, total income tax excludes
<br>
alternative minimum tax, Form 8814 tax (tax on a child's interest or
<br>
dividends), and Form 4972 tax (tax on lump-sum distributions from
<br>
qualified retirement plans) reported on some returns with a negative
<br>
amount for adjusted gross income. See also footnote 1. 
<br>
[4] The average tax rate was computed by dividing total income tax (see
<br>
footnote 3) by (positive) adjusted gross income. 
<br>
<p>Note: Unles otherwise stated, money amounts are in current (not
<br>
constant) denominations.
