<em>&gt; &gt; non-consensual physical suffering. There is a bit of a gray area
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the way the mind forms consent is vulnerable to forces just like
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>### As I remarked above, violence or &quot;force&quot; (in the meaning of
<br>
violence), by definition includes an element of lack of consent. If the
<br>
mind does not consent to the use of direct manipulation of the computing
<br>
substrate to induce changes in volition, producing such changes and any
<br>
actions resulting from them are non-consensual. If I don't want to kill
<br>
somebody, but my ruler injects me with drugs to suppress my prefrontal
<br>
cortex, and I kill, then violence has been done by the ruler, not by
<br>
myself.

<p><em>&gt;

<p>### Yes, presently it is so, although in the future it might be possible
<br>
to produce suicide bombers by direct neural stimulation.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;Does he consent to

<em>&gt; adopting the suicide-bomber-philosophy?

<p>### Ditto.
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p>Does he consent to being
<br>
<em>&gt; coincidentally exposed to the suicide-bomber-philosophy?
</em><br>
<p>### Partially, by hanging out in the wrong places and listening to false
<br>
prophets. This is essentially irrelevant to the two initial
<br>
questions,since almost all humans are exposed to
<br>
suicide-bomber-philosophy, yet only a very small minority actually
<br>
consent to suicide bombing.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Does he consent
<br>
<em>&gt; to living in circumstances that favor the adoption of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suicide-bomber-philosophy?
</em><br>
<p>### Since a very large number of choices other than suicide bombing
<br>
exist for absolutely all humans, one's living circumstances are
<br>
irrelevant as explanation for the consent to suicide-bomb.
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;AS you can see, the further you back up the
<br>
<em>&gt; analysis, the more &quot;consent&quot; disappears in a cloud of smoke.
</em><br>
<p>### On the contrary, consent is quite clear in the first two questions,
<br>
while the two latter ones are not relevant to this matter.
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The same goes for economic activities: does a person consent to buying a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; product he chooses to buy?
</em><br>
<p>### In a free market - yes.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Does he consent to only two products of the
<br>
<em>&gt; sort he wants being available?
</em><br>
<p><p>### Yes.
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Does he consent to only one product being
<br>
<em>&gt; sold practically near to him?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<br>
exposed to marketing at school, etc.)

<p>----------------------------------------

<em>&gt; <a href="mailto:jordan@chuma.cas.usf.edu?Subject=Re:%20Libertarian%20theory%20breaking%20down%20(contains%20possibly%20POLITICAL%20material)">jordan@chuma.cas.usf.edu</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; it is, a kind of mental construct to deal with the fact that human beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot quickly (in realtime) analyze all the forces operating upon them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and all the inner processes and external processes affecting the ongoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise of their personality. The mind's self-mental model is crude, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contains this &quot;ghost in the machine&quot; conceit.
</em><br>
<p>### The circuitry we use for determining the subjective feeling of &quot;free
<br>
will&quot; and consent is a mental construct, just as all qualia and
<br>
concepts. It is not crude, as most humans have the ability to detect
<br>
harmful deceit under most circumstances. An individual's feeling of free
<br>
will evolved to provide the best chances for reproduction in competition
<br>
with similarly endowed individuals. As a result even the least
<br>
intelligent persons can only with difficulty be led to self-destructive
<br>
acts, and suicide-bombing is quite uncommon. Especially in cultures
<br>
upholding the value of the individual freedom, and rigorous definitions
<br>
of violence.
<br>
<p>--------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Paying someone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; manufacture a product is parallel to paying someone to murder a person -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; just different results of the exercise of force.

<em>&gt; Both are economic activities, or can be analyzed that way. There are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markets for hits, and markets for clothes hangers, pricing considerations,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advertising potential, etc.
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, but this doesn't have much relevance to the need of a rigorous
<br>
definition of violence, and rejection of the concept of &quot;economic
<br>
force&quot;.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ### The construction &quot;to make somebody do something&quot; usually implies the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; use a threat of violence. A thug threating you with a beating if you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not buy a worthless trinket from him, may be threatened with violence,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by reciprocity. Sometimes, however, this expression is used differently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; - e.g. if a shopkeeper will sell item A only in association with item B,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; many people will say he &quot;made&quot; them buy it. In this second, sloppy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; meaning, there is of course no violence or a threat of violence, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accordingly, the buyer's reaction may not include such measures
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (including the use of state-organized violence).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I still don't think you've defined &quot;violence&quot; rigorously. If you buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something because youneed it to live, or crave it helplessly, or require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it for any minimal comfort, and because the person you are buying it from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the only person you can (for whatever reason) buy it from in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circumstances in which you need it, then I can analyze any of the&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scenarios as a play of forces, without aesthetically judging whether it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violent or not.
</em><br>
<p>### Go on.
<br>
<p>Judgment as to whether an action is violent or not is not aesthetic, it
<br>
is an ethical one, and important in deciding whether violent action may
<br>
be used in its prevention.
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If you exercise a perfectly calculated marketing plan on
<br>
<em>&gt; the appropriate audience, you can &quot;make&quot; them buy it as if you had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed a robot - without any thugs, baseball bats, or so on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
### It is still not possible to program humans. As a result, marketing
<br>
does not make anybody to anything - it merely influences choices
<br>
non-violently, e.g. by informing about the existence of a product and
<br>
price comparisons, and allowing superior choices.
<br>
<p>It amazes me that the claim is so frequently made, that humans are mere
<br>
marionettes at the tug of dark forces, marketers, and conspiracies.
