<p>&lt;Re-donning my Lorrey mask&gt;
<br>
<p>If the Baghdad battle is still going on in June, they might be. Or the 
<br>
Syrians might have already snuck in some of the FSU TBW stuff and US/UK 
<br>
might have to face it sooner than that. :| :\ :|
<br>
<p>They are not as effective in open spaces (no cavity for the convection cell 
<br>
to evacuate), and I wonder about weather; and they (in simple man-portable 
<br>
bunker buster/M209 form) won't plow through stuff like tank armor or honest 
<br>
concrete bunkers. At right-angles to foot or two of dirt, or into a 
<br>
concrete slab building, sure they'll penetrate. In enclosed spaces, they 
<br>
are kind of the small-scale-conventional analog to neutron bombs--kill 
<br>
people and leave the filing cabinets only singed. Or so they are 
<br>
advertised. In general weapons-effect terms, I think of it more as a 
<br>
variable-geometry concussion grenade you can't duck from. Or a lung- 
<br>
rupturing standoff flamethrower. Yes, it's not a pleasant prospect. And 
<br>
yes, somebody can still sneak up and bash you in the back of the head with 
<br>
a rock while you're squinting through the reticle.
<br>
<p>Re: &quot;terrorist&quot; uses (not to deny that the weapons themselve are pretty 
<br>
terifying all by themselves):
<br>
<p>As with most miltech, the easiest terror use is based on stealing it or 
<br>
divertng it, not reinventing it. That said, the primary ingredents of the 
<br>
US FAMs are pretty much public. No, I'm not naming them here. They are 
<br>
nasty (toxic) chemicals to begin with. Not sure about the thermobaric 
<br>
stuff. The remaining mysteries are dispersal and ignition, and that seems 
<br>
to me to be a matter of a few months, maybe a year, tops, of messing around 
<br>
in the vicinity of desert caves with a milling machine and a set of 
<br>
chemical-supply and surplus-store catalogs handy--and a DHL drop. Having a 
<br>
few unexpended/dud rounds could shorten that time quite a bit, as long as 
<br>
you were lucky or clever.
