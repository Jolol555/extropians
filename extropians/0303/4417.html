<p><em>&gt; &gt; Any huge system, like a government, will always do what is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advantageous for it to do.  Right now, for example, in almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; any Western country to arrest people for speaking their views
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is practically unthinkable (not only because of the political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consequences, but, like other entitles, governments are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; creatures of habit too).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Until now if our particular government wanted to do such things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it at least did not have the law its side.  Today the gloves are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off.  Bill of Rights?  Constitution?  Forget them.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you are exaggerating.  In &quot;war time&quot;, the
<br>
usual freedoms are curtailed to some extent---if you 
<br>
don't believe me, then read about World War I, the Civil
<br>
War, and World War II.  You may also ponder how well one
<br>
would have faired demonstrating against the Churchill
<br>
government in London in 1941.
<br>
<p>(I don't know why this impulse to overstate your position;
<br>
you have plenty of real ammunition in the apparent fact 
<br>
that any liberties are being curtailed at all!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Laws are on the books to prosecute any of us at any time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with or without such formalities as an actual arrest, due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process and all of that.  All your assets can be seized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you can be disappeared without any formal proceedings 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indefinitely.
</em><br>
<p>The asset forfeiture laws are indeed scary, and there
<br>
have been numerous victims.  But this cannot be tied
<br>
to any particular administration (not that I'm saying
<br>
you were implying this).  Do you have a concrete case
<br>
in mind?  I would really appreciate it.
<br>
<p>My own example goes something like this:  in Santa
<br>
Clara County where I live, I think that it would
<br>
only take three men to lock me up for years and
<br>
years.  The sheriff and two underlings could find
<br>
a way to with impunity search my house for drugs
<br>
or child pornography and &quot;find&quot; loads of evidence
<br>
that really isn't here.  My best protection from
<br>
this (shudder) is that if they did it to more than
<br>
a few people a year, they could be jeopardizing
<br>
their careers.  So statistically, I'm pretty safe
<br>
even if such a trio is so malevolent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Any of us can have all aspects of our lives tracked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and monitored, all of our communication and relationships
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully scrutinized and without so much as a court order.
</em><br>
<p>I don't care.  I hope they do.  It should be edifying for
<br>
them.  To few appreciate how proper extropians live.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not a matter of what party will use this.  It is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter of We the People now officially having the status of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; utterly disenfranchised serfs.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, I can just see you getting teleported to the 9th
<br>
century into a hut on a field under the thumb of a real
<br>
overlord.  And I can just see you saying, &quot;well, the
<br>
standard of living is lower, but I have just as many
<br>
rights.&quot;  (Sarcasm)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, worse than serfs. [Oh come now.] Serfs weren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taxed for more than 10% of their income.
</em><br>
<p>In some places they were.  But the key feature is that they
<br>
couldn't spout off about it, nor get to vote on it.  While
<br>
I'm as annoyed as you are that the government takes more
<br>
than half the wealth I produce each year (and mostly uses
<br>
it to weaken the economy), I have to admit that it is all
<br>
the fault of us citizens who vote for politicians and who
<br>
approve of their programs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [Scenarios:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (1) The country becomes palpably involved in a life-or-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     death struggle.  E.g., Japanese troops in 1942 finally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     conquer Denver, with Dallas-Fort Worth soon to fall.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     Or an evil third-world terrorist group succeeds in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     smuggling in so many atomic bombs that they begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     going off one every two days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     In either of these scenarios, most Western governments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     at least those with any backbone such as the U.S., would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     crack down on any---repeat, any---effort that appeared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     in the slightest way to hinder the war effort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You claim this is good or what this country purports to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about?  This country has zero right to do any such cracking down 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on those who oppose any or all of its policies and actions.
</em><br>
<p>I do.  Democracies (or republics, as you like to remind us)
<br>
need to do what they need to do to defend themselves.  Later
<br>
total civil liberties can be restored.  Again, I commend to
<br>
your attention the prior wars of the U.S.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; At present, I see almost zero chance of scenarios like these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; developing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you feel all safe and secure?  [Yes.]  Poor innocent lamb!
</em><br>
<p>Hey, hey, hey!  I sense a possibility for mutual profit!
<br>
Since you see a much higher probability than I do for
<br>
such a development, let's find a way to bet on it.  That
<br>
way, you can take out insurance against people like us
<br>
getting slaughtered (what happens to lambs), and I can
<br>
invest in the country remaining respectful of almost
<br>
everyone's rights.  We could perhaps bet on whether at
<br>
least one member of the ExI board goes to jail during
<br>
the next two years.  If you don't like that, can you
<br>
think of some other way for us to profitably exploit
<br>
this disagreement?
