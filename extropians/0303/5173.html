<p><em>&gt; It doesn't matter, because he has in some sense transcended.

<p>Yes.

<p><em>&gt; Apparently he has delegated command (this is inferred from

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not so obscure. 
<br>
<p>Brave Empirocles,
<br>
ardent soul,
<br>
lept into Mt Etna,
<br>
and was roasted whole.
<br>
<p>Bertrand Russell. History of Western Philosophy from memory. I'm
<br>
not sure about the spelling of &quot;Empirocles&quot;. I'm a bit better on 'songs'
<br>
than 'singers'. I'd look it up, but then it wouldn't be from memory ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To get this back into transhumanism (after all, otherwise this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue shouldn't even be discussed on this list): This kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;immortality by delegation&quot; is actually interesting from a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; functionalist perspective. If you are defined by your function, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by what you do, then you could actually be replaced by another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; external system doing the same functions.
</em><br>
<p>Ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as my colleauges have pointed out, why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not replace myself by a set of very good actors? These actors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would learn everything relevant about the behavior and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations of me, and eventually take my place. My own argument 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against this is of course that many of my internal processes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are only (and can only be) privately known such as my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness, would not be transferred in such a scheme.
</em><br>
<p>But what of it? If you are looking at it from a functionalist perspective?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Similarly with Saddam; by having enough people acting as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if he was alive and according to his will, he is in some sense 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded within the social matrix of Iraq. 
</em><br>
<p>Resurrected in replica. Powerful memetic warfare if one can
<br>
pull it off.
<br>
<p>Regards,
