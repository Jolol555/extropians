</em><br>
<p>Yes.  Of course, Gordon, one factor that influences your posts
<br>
is your own political viewpoint.  You might not be so conscious
<br>
of it (or you may be), but your own sympathies for the points
<br>
of view expressed by CNN color your judgment;  for example,
<br>
in calling Fox News &quot;for morons&quot;.  You would, for example, never
<br>
hear me say anything of the kind about stations whose coverage
<br>
were biased in a direction different from my own.
<br>
<p>I don't see too much TV, but I do pick up the same bias between
<br>
the cable stations as the rest of you have affirmed.  But I can
<br>
hardly criticize you favoring CNN and Mitch favoring Fox News
<br>
because each of you is actually learning more from your respective
<br>
stations.
<br>
<p>I need to get into this concept further when I have time to reply
<br>
to Hal's post on &quot;ideological blinders&quot;, but here is what I think
<br>
is going on.  Suppose *you* try to watch Fox News.  So many of
<br>
the attitudes that seep through, and so many of the conscious and
<br>
subconscious presumptions they make just don't fit your view of
<br>
the world.  So the presentation doesn't wholly make sense to you,
<br>
seems insipid, and less intelligent.
<br>
<p>Mitch and I, on the other hand, learn far more readily from the
<br>
cable stations which share our biases.  The information we 
<br>
pick up further elaborates our own views, supplementing them
<br>
with facts.  You on the other hand would have a lot of criticism
<br>
of these supposed &quot;facts&quot;, and find them not so digestible.
<br>
Vice-versa when Mitch or I watch Dan Rather or Peter Jennings
<br>
disparage the American effort in every way that they can within
<br>
the bounds of propriety.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the way, I sent a message a couple of hours ago in which I stated that in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my opinion FOX News is a news network designed by and for morons. I hope you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think I was referring specifically to you.
</em><br>
<p>No, of course not.  You just meant conservatives in general.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just have some pretty strong feelings about this subject.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think bias in the media should be investigated and exposed.
</em><br>
<p>I totally agree.  The standard should be this:  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;CAN OR CANNOT A REASONABLY SOPHISTICATED VIEWER DETERMINE
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THE POLITICAL IDEOLOGY OF THE REPORTERS, WRITERS, AND
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NEWS DIRECTORS?
<br>
<p>I would like to see the existence of at least three kinds of
<br>
stations:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Those who pass the above test of objectivity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Those who very obviously and clearly lean
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;towards the left, and present information
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;at a high level, in depth analysis from a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;leftist point of view that EXPLAINS what is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;going on to a leftist audience.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. The exact same thing as (2), except for 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;rightists.
<br>
<p>(And the list 1, 2, ... could be extended indefinitely
<br>
to cover libertarian and &quot;progressive&quot; views, etc.)
<br>
<p>What has been criminally unfair in American media for decades
<br>
and decades is the bastards under (2) above pretending that
<br>
they were of type (1).  I had to endure this from 1960 right
<br>
through 1988.  Only in 1988 was a conservative allowed a
<br>
national audience so that he could EXPLAIN and articulate
<br>
in a comprehensive manner of (3) above how the world appears
<br>
from the point of view of my ideology.  The screams about
<br>
Rush Limbaugh have not died down to this day.  Finding their
<br>
monopoly on public news challenged, the liberals have even
<br>
attempted to pass &quot;equal time&quot; legislation that would force
<br>
radio stations playing Rush and his imitators to provide
<br>
one on one rebuttals to everything said!
<br>
<p>And if you think that I will *ever* forgive Walter Cronkite,
<br>
Dan Rather, and Peter Jennings for their politicizing, their
<br>
constant insidious and underhanded tainting of the &quot;news&quot;,
<br>
you are quite mistaken.
<br>
<p>(Just last year that rascal Dan Rather was complaining overseas
<br>
that to be opposed to the American administration (read Bush),
<br>
was to risk being &quot;necklaced&quot;, reminiscent of the frightful
<br>
torture and death of dissidents in South Africa.  And this is
<br>
what has passed for forty years as &quot;objective&quot; American media.)
