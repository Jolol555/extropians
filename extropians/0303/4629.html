Mike Lorrey said it much better than I:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Okay, let me get this straight: PAII proposes to make the use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encryption *while in the commission of a felony* itself a felonious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; act. Okay, so as long as I don't commit any felonies, I don't have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything to worry about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the difficulty, Amara, of raising real public concern. Those of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us who are law abiding don't see it as a threat to us.
</em><br>
<p>Not as a threat; true.  But is it ideal or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many things which are constitutionally acceptable that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar to the draft proposal. For example, the act of using a firearm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would otherwise be constitutionally protected behavior, while in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; commission of a felony, is itself a felony.
</em><br>
<p>Good law or bad?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The act of using a phone, which would otherwise be a constitutionally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; protected behavior, while in commission of fraud, is itself a felony.
</em><br>
<p>Now this is getting silly again.  Just like, IMO, hate crime
<br>
or making encryption while committing a felony an additional crime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The act of using a ballot, an otherwise constitutionally protected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior, while in the commission of election fraud, is itself a felony.
</em><br>
<p>Our silly laws really like to pile on, don't they.  It's
<br>
as if they're afraid they don't have enough to convict
<br>
someone of criminal behavior, and so that's why we see
<br>
these absurd numbers, e.g., 27 counts of blah blah blah,
<br>
and 17 counts of blah blah, all over a single incident.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The act of possessing or using a tone generator, an otherwise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutionally protected activity, while in the commission...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [etc.]
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many otherwise constitutional activities and technologies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, if used in an illegal manner, constitute crimes in and of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.  That use of such technologies should increase the total
</em><br>
<em>&gt; penalties a convict should receive reflects the degree to which such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies make it easier for such criminals to violate the rights of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law abiding citizens.
</em><br>
<p>I don't follow the logic of your last sentence.  Okay, certain
<br>
technologies make it easier to commit crimes, e.g., automobiles
<br>
greatly facilitate bank holdups.  So what?
<br>
<p>Lee
