<p>
I really like this approach, Alex. I haven't checked myself out for trolldom
<br>
using your metric, but I think I'd probably come up positive :-(
<br>
<p>As to how to deal with it, this is my approach (which I will now use more
<br>
forcefully in the face of this wake-up call). Bear in mind that I only use
<br>
the email interface, not the web interface (ie: I am eCroMagnon man).
<br>
<p>Simply put, the killfile is the way. As I'm an outlook user (boo, hiss), I
<br>
use a message rules to delete particular posters. It took me a long time to
<br>
get up the courage to do this, and I still have difficulty with it. Why?...
<br>
<p><p>Firstly, I find it very hard to see something said that I disagree with, and
<br>
to let it pass without comment. I'd say this is very, very common in
<br>
general, and on this list in particular. I find that one of my fears
<br>
regarding killfiling is that comments would pass me by to which I *should*
<br>
respond, but I wont because I wont see them.
<br>
<p>Secondly, I worry that those I've plonked might say something interesting
<br>
once in a while, and I'll miss it. That's actually happens, in my
<br>
experience, and so is a valid fear.
<br>
<p>Thirdly, it feels like a violation of free speech to killfile people. It
<br>
seems so harsh, to just shut them out of my universe.
<br>
<p><p>In response to this, I've had to do a *lot* of thinking. I think that a
<br>
general philosophy of individualism has come to my rescue, somewhat, to give
<br>
me a framework for addressing this stuff.
<br>
<p><p>About letting things pass without comment, all I can tell myself is that
<br>
this is the only way to deal with trolls. It's about engagement, and the
<br>
solution is to not engage. If I think someone speaks crap, why read it?
<br>
Foremost I must convince myself that *it is not my job to save other people
<br>
onlist from being swayed by bad arguments*. That'd be individualism; each
<br>
person is responsible for his/her own mental life. I judge that those onlist
<br>
are capable individuals, and have chosen to read the list; thus I have no
<br>
duty to go up against opinions of others unless I personally feel motivated
<br>
to. Further, I believe that in the spirit of extro-l, I really should only
<br>
be posting when my post will add something, in an extropic sense, to the
<br>
list. 
<br>
<p>(aside: I believe that other list members should also believe this, but I
<br>
also believe that when the word &quot;should&quot; pops up in my thinking, big
<br>
flashing lights and sirens must go off. Individualism says to me that
<br>
&quot;should&quot;, when it applies to me, can be enforced; however, if I am applying
<br>
it to others, I don't have any right to enforce it. With others, I can
<br>
initiate communication, but no coercive behaviour, excepting where I think
<br>
others are infringing on my personal liberties (ie: stopping me from
<br>
thinking and/or living as I see fit))
<br>
<p><p>About missing useful post from the plonked, I've learned that it's a risk
<br>
worth taking; cost/benefit analysis puts me ahead. After all, these are
<br>
people that I've judged, for me personally, to be extremely low s/n. Also,
<br>
as a back door, these people's posts go to a Deleted folder for a while,
<br>
giving me a chance to reinstate useful posts if, for instance, I see a reply
<br>
to such a post and want to see the original. Also, posts are retrievable
<br>
from the website if it turns out I really did delete something I would like
<br>
to keep.
<br>
<p>In terms of free speech, a killfile is not an infringement. Free speech
<br>
doesn't require that I listen. As long as my killfiling doesn't affect
<br>
anyone else's ability to access these posts, I've not trampled on anyone's
<br>
liberties; it's my choice. Incidentally, I'd be concerned about too much by
<br>
way of reputation tracking/management on the webserver, if they were to
<br>
start setting defaults about which posts were most valuable, or in other
<br>
ways directly modifying other people's views of the list. Although, if the
<br>
mechanisms were openly published, and everyone was consenting, I guess
<br>
that's ok. I can't imagine the extropian list members agreeing to mechanisms
<br>
like that, however.
<br>
<p>About plonking, I have found it imperfect. What I am trying to achieve is,
<br>
partially, to stop myself from replying to crap that I should ignore by
<br>
making sure I never see it. Unfortunately, I often see other people's
<br>
responses to said crap, which usually includes the original, and sucks me
<br>
in. I don't really know how to cope with that problem, except to get a bit
<br>
more self control (ie: I'm buggered).
<br>
<p>Finally, as a related aside, I think that moderating a list, or banning
<br>
people, doesn't necessarily impinge on free speech. I think that web lists
<br>
in general, for example, can be taken as a whole; in that context, kicking
<br>
someone off a list doesn't stop them from going to others, starting their
<br>
own, or even creating massive websites to publicise their views. Lists just
<br>
have to be true to their charter, whatever that may be. In the case of
<br>
extro-l, I think it'd have to be a very, very good reason before you started
<br>
banning people (given the charter of the list), but there are cases where it
<br>
is necessary. And that's ok.

<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; do you distinguish a stealth-conservative from a libertarian?

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah! Good question. I've been kicking it around for a while. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's see if I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer it without breaking my pledge (see start of this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread). How many of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the following organizations do you find distasteful out of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all proportion to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any specific arguments you put forward to justify your distaste:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ACLU (IMHO this one is the strongest bellwhether of what you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really are)      
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation                   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NAACP

<em>&gt; Women's Health Action Mobilization

<em>&gt;                 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The more of them tick you off for, the more you fit into the former
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category. If you are indifferent to all of them, or even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them on bits and pieces of their agendae, that places you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the latter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category. Obviously, only you know for sure... hopefully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we're all at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honest with ourselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Other people can only INFER which end of the spectrum you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fall on. Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more emotional and dogmatic you sound, the less Extropian you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically, regardless of what kind of non-Extropian you are.

<em>&gt; with greater
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency rather than call for their banning, suing, fining, jailing,
</em><br>
