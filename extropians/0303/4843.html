Okay, so I fire a really sarcastic stream of denunciation at
<br>
Michael, and he takes it all in stride, like water off a
<br>
duck's back.
<br>
<p>Ooooooh!  That makes me mad!
<br>
<p>;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A non-public remark of one villager
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to another might be, &quot;I understand that we are putting up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this silliness because somebody over there might send some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; money, but shouldn't we be honest with the poor kids?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, I would hope such an education program would quickly disavow such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a possible incentive.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, let's suppose so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Such would give well-off classrooms a distinct advantage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Individual kids would be welcome to send their allowance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course, but it should be made clear to the 'adopted'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; village that the program itself is not going to give them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money.  Just information and advice.
</em><br>
<p>You don't think they'd be offended?  I mean, how would the
<br>
people in your community feel if a school group from some
<br>
town in Sweden or Israel decided to help out the American
<br>
people living in your town?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The kids would have the advantage of time. They could spend all day 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (indeed, maybe every day of their entire schooling) working on things 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that might help the village. Possibly, they might plan out supply, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution, and sharing networks that, while the villagers might be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly able to do for themselves, they simply don't have the time to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; research.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I should mention a teenager I know who went to Honduras last
<br>
summer, as a part of a high school program.  Being quite curious
<br>
about far away places, so long as I don't need to get very far away
<br>
from my books and my refrigerator, I invited him over one night to
<br>
debrief him.  Earlier, he had sent me a long letter, which began
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dear Mr. Corbin,
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you know, shortly after school ended last year, I left on my 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;trip to Honduras with the Amigos dellas Americas program.  I flew
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first to Miami and then on to Tegucigalpa, the capitol [sic] of 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honduras.  We then rode eight hours by bus to the Intibuca district
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and the town of Las Esperanza.  We spent a few days in &quot;briefing&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;where we got used to listeining to Spanish, with a Honduran accent,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;spoken at what seemed like the speed of light.
<br>
<p>He then related the ride to a small village of 25 families, Villa Francis,
<br>
in the back of a pickup truck along a dusty road, and the efforts of him
<br>
and his friend to meet the family they would be staying with, and to go
<br>
around and try to meet the people of the village.  Everyone was unsure of
<br>
what to say.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What we hadn't acccounted for was that we would be working the next
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;day, and the next.  Our town was so eager to work with us that they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;had already orgaized themselves and decided who neede what project,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and in what order.
<br>
<p>Well, it turned out (of course) that Chris and his friend really had to
<br>
learn what to do from the villagers.  They had to learn construction
<br>
techniques, and how to dig latrines, and so forth.  The villagers were
<br>
indeed eager---as I verified when I talked to him at length---for the
<br>
help from the two American students.  But what they *really* wanted
<br>
was (1) all the free supplies (building materials, mostly) that would
<br>
be sent along with the students, and (2) the free labor that Chris
<br>
and his friend would provide over the summer.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But we learned how to do each project and within a week or two
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we were a productive force for the completion of each project,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;even managing to make suggestions as to how some problems could
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be overcome.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, any positive memes that come out of this can be shared instantly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with all the other adopter classrooms. No doubt getting the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; village online with even minimal real contact would be a big hurdle.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But young kids (perhaps boys especially) can be quite competitive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps a series of prizes would be an additional incentive when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the going gets rough.
</em><br>
<p>All right.  So you have in mind some ideas that the (rather
<br>
young) American children might have that would help the
<br>
villagers?  It still seems doubtful to me.  Perhaps you
<br>
mean insofar as computer tech or cell phones that the kids
<br>
here know all about?  Of course, I doubt if you have any
<br>
ideas yourself, Michael, because after all, you are not in
<br>
contact with a *particular* village.  But what kind of thing
<br>
can you imagine that might be of help to the village after
<br>
some inventive people *here* --- be they children or not ---
<br>
could really do?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes! And with the skills the kids develop, they can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; man the hotlines to resolve domestic disturbances,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intractable corporate mergers, and any number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conflicts that periodically arise between groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and individuals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, you're reaching, but it could happen.
</em><br>
<p>Oooooooh.  Isn't it irritating when people do that to
<br>
your carefully constructed sarcasm???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks for your positive suggestions,
</em><br>
<p>Oooooooh.  Twist the knife.  I should have known better than
<br>
to get into this with you.
<br>
<p>Lee  :-)
