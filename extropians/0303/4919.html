I believe that a month or so ago, I made repeated predictions that the
<br>
price of oil would drop within a week of the start of the war to below
<br>
$25/bbl and would be around $10/bbl by a year from now. Others disputed
<br>
this and claimed it would go to $50/bbl or more. It appears that my
<br>
prediction is coming true. Brent crude is now below $25/bbl, losing
<br>
$1.15 yesterday alone.
<br>
<p>US and British forces have successfully captured oil platforms and
<br>
loading facilities as well as many southern oil fields with relatively
<br>
little sabotage to well facilities by Iraqi forces. Some were captured
<br>
within hours of being sabotaged, apparently, and it appears that 31
<br>
special forces teams were inserted across Iraq more than a week ago to
<br>
not only target ballistic missile batteries but to eliminate oil
<br>
sabotage teams.
<br>
<p>This is not only of paramount importance to the world energy markets,
<br>
it is a triumph of environmental protection in wartime. I damn well
<br>
expect the Greens to line up in thanks to any US or Brit soldier they
<br>
come across (but I doubt it will happen). I expect the socialists and
<br>
other lefties in France are somewhat conflicted (as are lefists around
<br>
the world). While they can't avoid the fact that a major environmental
<br>
disaster of historic proportions was averted, they also have to face
<br>
the fact that tanking oil prices will cut off oil tax revinues to
<br>
social welfare bureaucracies. 
<br>
<p>I now make a second prediction (I might have already made this one): by
<br>
this time next year, european governments will have a funding crisis,
<br>
forcing them to either jack up taxes or cut support for welfare programs.
