<p>What follows is a snippet of a well-deserved attack on the New York Times, by 
<br>
National Review writer, Tom Gross. This is an alternative view highlighting 
<br>
how many newsorgs cover events. Food for thought
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;By Tom Gross
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;s the world's most important daily newspaper, the New York Times is 
<br>
disproportionately influential in framing the public and diplomatic discourse 
<br>
on many issues, both in the U.S. and beyond. This is particularly true with 
<br>
regard to the Middle East, given how much space it allocates to the subject. 
<br>
One of the great myths of modern journalism, particularly outside the U.S., 
<br>
is that the New York Times is &quot;pro-Israel.&quot; In fact, it would be truer to say 
<br>
that the opposite is the case. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
A TALE OF TWO BAPTISTS
<br>
On March 4, a 59-year-old American Baptist, William P. Hyde, was among 21 
<br>
people killed by a suicide bomber in Davao in the southern Philippines. That 
<br>
an American died was made clear in the following day's New York Times. The 
<br>
Times titled its news report &quot;Bombing Kills An American And 20 Others In 
<br>
Philippines.&quot; The first seven paragraphs concerned Hyde, who had lived and 
<br>
worked in the Philippines since 1978, and another American, Barbara Stevens, 
<br>
who had been &quot;slightly wounded&quot; in the attack. The caption alongside two 
<br>
photos on the front page of that day's Times also made reference to his 
<br>
death, as did a news summary on page 2. In addition, the paper ran an 
<br>
editorial titled &quot;Fighting Terror in the Philippines.&quot; And a front-page photo 
<br>
of a wounded boy, and the caption that accompanied it, made clear that at 
<br>
least one child had been among the injured. 
<br>
<p>On the next day (March 5), another American Baptist, 14-year-old Abigail 
<br>
Litle, was among 16 people killed by a suicide bomber on a bus in Haifa, 
<br>
Israel. The story and photo caption in the March 6 Times, tucked at the 
<br>
bottom corner of page 1, made no mention of Abigail's name. Neither the 
<br>
headline nor the photo caption indicated that an American had died, or that 
<br>
the suicide bomber had deliberately chosen a bus packed with schoolchildren, 
<br>
or that a majority of those killed had been teenagers. 
<br>
<p>The suicide bombers in both Davao and Haifa were acting on behalf of Muslim 
<br>
fundamentalist groups fighting for separate states. But the Haifa bomber was 
<br>
arguably worse. He deliberately chose children as his target, and his bomb 
<br>
was packed with specially sharpened nails and shrapnel to maximize pain and 
<br>
to make it harder for doctors to save the wounded.
<br>
<p>Readers of some newspapers — but not of the Times — were told that Litle's 
<br>
Missouri-born parents had rushed to Haifa's Rambam hospital to look for their 
<br>
&quot;wounded&quot; daughter and instead had found only what remained of her: her legs. 
<br>
They had identified Abigail from an ankle bracelet still attached to one of 
<br>
them. That day's New York Post carried a picture of the pretty, New 
<br>
Hampshire-born schoolgirl who had been active in Jewish-Arab school dialogue 
<br>
groups on its front page...&gt;&gt;
