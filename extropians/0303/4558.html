</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; I've been keeping an eye open for a reasonably good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; description of the legal ramifications of any &quot;unilateral&quot; decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; to take military action against Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would have thought that was obvious; recent events have made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it abundantly clear that while the international community is quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adept at generating huge amounts of high minded verbiage it is totally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incapable of enforcing any of it. So to answer your question, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ramifications of breaking international law (assuming those two words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even have a meaning after today) are precisely zero.
</em><br>
<p>In the international community reputations matter. The collateral damage
<br>
to the US and to the interests of its citizens has started already. 
<br>
<p>The United States signed the United Nations Charter and (under the 
<br>
Bush administration) resolution 1441. These are solemn agreements
<br>
made on very serious matters and any breaches of them and the 
<br>
consequences of any breaches of them by the US (under the Bush
<br>
administration) will remain on the public record longer than Saddam
<br>
Hussein or President Bush remain at the head of their respective 
<br>
Nation states.
<br>
<p>John, I am not anti-american (whatever that means) and I will not
<br>
mourn the passing of Saddam's regime but I think it will now be 
<br>
achieved by inferior means and with more collateral damage because,
<br>
frankly, when the hard decisions requiring executive judgements 
<br>
needed to be made, President Bush was the U.S. President.   
<br>
<p>President Bush had alternatives. He more than anyone else was AND
<br>
STILL IS controlling the clock and President Chirac, as I
<br>
understand it, had moved as far as to accept a deadline of as short 
<br>
as 1 month. 
<br>
<p>With a united UN making the ultimatum the prospects of removing 
<br>
Saddam alive (and far more importantly keeping the UN intact and
<br>
preventing loss of life and property) would have been much greater. 
<br>
<p>This is not the best source for Chirac's statement by any means
<br>
but its a source I just happen to have handy as it is in today's
<br>
copy  (Tuesday March 18) of The Australian.
<br>
<p>Title: Frantic last-ditch UN talks
<br>
<p>&quot;French President  Jacques Chirac said yesterday he was willing to
<br>
accept a one-month to two month deadline provided the move was
<br>
endorsed by the chief UN weapons inspectors&quot; 
<br>
<p><p>Hell John, on that basis *I* could write a UN Resolution that would
<br>
break the deadlock with France.  Simply re-craft the draft one proffered
<br>
by Spain, the US and the UK with a one-month deadline by stating the 
<br>
' &quot;final opportunity&quot; in 1441 shall be deemed to have been passed by 
<br>
the Security Council in one-month from this date and &quot;serious measures&quot;
<br>
extending up to and including the removal of Iraq's ruling regime by 
<br>
force shall, at that time, shall be automatically authorised.' &quot;  
<br>
<p>President Bush can (i.e.. the power exists in the US Presidency to) draw
<br>
France and Chirac out into an untenable position with the greatest of 
<br>
ease if President Bush so chooses. Chirac probably wants to be drawn
<br>
out. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But President Bush has to be *capable* and *willing* to do it. Just as
<br>
he is responsible for any excessive collateral damage including to the 
<br>
US if he does not do it.
<br>
