Ron responded to Artillo:
<br>
<p>Arti,
<br>
None of that matters. What counts is that the US is the one that has 
<br>
been shot at, hit, lost citizenry/visitors, and is being aimed at again. 
<br>
That you wish to knock off the US, aren't concerned with American loss of 
<br>
life and don't like us anyway means nothing. 
<br>
Have a good day,
<br>
Ron h.
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
To which Artillo responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;Ron,
<br>
<p>Up until now I have refrained from responding on any of your commentary thus 
<br>
far, but I think this one takes the cake and is deserving of a reply.Your 
<br>
obvious lack of reading comprehension skills and penchant for putting words 
<br>
in people's mouths makes you sound like more of a buffoon than ever before.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&quot;Point #1: I think that the opinion of the world's human beings matters very 
<br>
much. Unfortunately, there will never be a completely honest representation 
<br>
of people's opinions in any poll for obvious reasons.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yes, because the majority of the people on Earth continue to be ruled by 
<br>
heartless and self-interested tyrants, unlike those people living in the 
<br>
United States.
<br>
<p>&quot;Point #2: Nowhere in my post did I EVER state that I &quot;wish[ed] to knock off 
<br>
the US&quot; as you seem to think I did. I think I stated my intentions rather 
<br>
plainly in the original post. Read more carefully next time.&quot;
<br>
<p>Please correct me if I'm wrong, Artillo, but in your original post (which I 
<br>
have included at the bottom) you want a poll taken in the &quot;world community&quot; 
<br>
to determine if everyone feels it is appropriate to stand firm against the 
<br>
UNITED STATES. Now, whether or not you are suggesting a loss of life of 
<br>
American citizens, you are obviously advocating a diminished influence, or 
<br>
outright humbling of, the United States. A diminished US would simply lead to 
<br>
another nation filling the vacuum of power and influence.
<br>
<p>Now, &quot;Old Europe&quot; (to use Donald Rumsfeld's phrase) is not even willing to 
<br>
honor its own resolutions in the United Nations regarding disarming Saddam 
<br>
Hussein. The only reason Mr. Hussein is cooperating AT ALL with the weapons 
<br>
inspectors is because there are 250,000 American troops in his backyard. And 
<br>
the cooperation he has shown has been at best half-hearted, and certainly 
<br>
nowhere near serious enough for anyone to believe, including Hans Blix, that 
<br>
Mr. Hussein has any intention of fully disarming at any point in the near 
<br>
future. I have not heard Misters Chirac and Schroeder offer the use of 
<br>
250,000 French and German troops in place of US forces to insure that Hussein 
<br>
disarms. So, one can only draw the conclusion that these nations are simply 
<br>
interested in increasing their own influence at the expense of the US, rather 
<br>
than putting any legitimacy into UN resolutions. That does not even address 
<br>
the merits of the UN as currently organized, where a nation such as Libya 
<br>
chairs the human rights committee and the French have a say nowhere near 
<br>
their actual geopolitical power and influence. The Chinese, at least 
<br>
publicly, are doing nowhere near enough in regard to Kim Jong Il's activities 
<br>
in North Korea. So, I would be curious to know which country in your view has 
<br>
handled the mantle of world leadership more responsibly than the US. More to 
<br>
the point, which nation(s) would be able to wield this power more 
<br>
&quot;responsibly&quot; and not in their own self-interest that would be more 
<br>
beneficial to the world than the United States? 
<br>
<p>&quot;Point #3: I am not only concerned with the loss of American lives, but the 
<br>
lives of EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING ON THE PLANET. If war can be averted at any 
<br>
<p>cost then THAT is the road we need to take for HUMANITY'S sake. We need to 
<br>
stop slaughtering eachother over bullshit ideological, religious, or 
<br>
otherwise dogmatic reasons.&quot;
<br>
<p>Your implication here appears to be that war is always bad, regardless of 
<br>
circumstances, and that is obviously historically false. I, for one, am 
<br>
concerned with the well being of my fellow American citizens, but I am 
<br>
equally concerned with the well-being of those people currently living under 
<br>
the boot heel of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. There is no question that the people 
<br>
of Iraq, just as in the case of Afghanistan, would see their quality of life 
<br>
bettered if Hussein's regime is removed. Conservative estimates put the 
<br>
number of those who have died due to Hussein's regime at 200,000 since 1979. 
<br>
War to remove Saddam Hussein is the best thing that could happen to those 
<br>
embattled people in the long term. The United States acting in its own 
<br>
defensive interests, with the people of Iraq benefiting from this action 
<br>
through the removal of a tyrannical regime, are hardly &quot;bullshit ideological 
<br>
reasons&quot;. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Point #4: I think you have the misconception that I am not an American 
<br>
Citizen. The only kinds of people I dislike are ignorant, close-minded, and 
<br>
blindly patriotic, but... this is America and everyone is entitled to their 
<br>
opinion as long as it's not forced down our throats. Would I be better off as 
<br>
<p>a citizen of another country? I surely don't know.&quot;
<br>
<p>Let me make clear that I do not believe that anyone on either side of the war 
<br>
debate has a monopoly on patriotism, nor do I believe one side has a monopoly 
<br>
on &quot;forcing opinions down our throats.&quot; In terms of your question regarding 
<br>
whether or not you would be better off as a citizen of another country, there 
<br>
is not one pat answer. If you are fortunate enough to be in one of the 
<br>
European democracies, then the question is up for debate. But if you were a 
<br>
citizen of Iraq and not in the ruling elite, then the answer is obviously no.
<br>
<p><p>&quot;Ron, why exactly are you still on this list? It seems to me that much of the 
<br>
<p>rhetoric I have seen you spouting off recently seems to have very little with 
<br>
<p>core Extropian values and a lot to do with you being pissed off at the way 
<br>
the world is today. YES I agree with you, the world is a pretty messed up 
<br>
place, YES there are lots and lots of bad people out there, and YES there are 
<br>
<p>many forms of injustice out there, however, I do NOT agree with ANY 
<br>
government who decides to KILL to support their own brand of dogma, INCLUDING 
<br>
<p>the United States.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, I hope you're not suggesting that one side of this argument alone has 
<br>
resorted to any sort of rhetoric during this debate. Too many times those 
<br>
opposed to the war have used unfortunate phrases such as &quot;war horny&quot; to 
<br>
dismiss people's deeply held and thought out convictions regarding support 
<br>
for war with Hussein. In regard to your second point, regarding &quot;brands of 
<br>
dogma&quot; are you suggesting that the political systems employed by the United 
<br>
States and Iraq are somehow of equal value?
<br>
<p>&quot;I also am very disconcerted about the direction the 
<br>
current US administration and it's agents are taking this country are taking 
<br>
in regards to our civil liberties. I don't think I have to lecture you on the 
<br>
<p>importance of rational arguments on these issues and the rights of the people 
<br>
<p>to petition the government for a redress of grievances if they have a problem 
<br>
<p>with the way things are going. I hope that those of us who truly care about 
<br>
these and other rights make their voices heard loud and clear before those 
<br>
same rights are taken away from us by policies that are bordering on 
<br>
Fascism.&quot;
<br>
<p>The people of the United States do have a redress for their grievances, and 
<br>
Bush will stand before the people in 2004. This is certanly NOT the case in 
<br>
Saddam Hussein's Iraq. You on one hand criticize the current US 
<br>
administration using unhelpful rhetoric like &quot;policies that are bordering on 
<br>
fascism&quot;, while on the other advocate a policy that would leave in power a 
<br>
dictator that has murdered at least 200,000 of his own people. 
<br>
<p>&quot;If you don't like it when someone like me wants to try to get a balanced 
<br>
view 
<br>
of the issues by attmpting to obtain information from sources outside of 
<br>
their general sphere of resources, then I suggest you stop reading any more 
<br>
emails and simply rely on CBS news or wherever you go to shop for your daily 
<br>
dose of yellow journalism. Of course, you are more than welcome to 
<br>
participate in a Flame War with me, but it will be a rather futile exercise 
<br>
(you can't have a war with only one side fighting!), so I would encourage you 
<br>
<p>to maintain your dignity and stop before you start.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, someone could simply suggest that you stop reading the editorials in 
<br>
Playboy magazine, &quot;or wherever you go to stop for your daily dose of yellow 
<br>
journalism&quot;. I know Ron's convictions are deeply held and thought out, and I 
<br>
believe the same is true with you. You have made strong statements regarding 
<br>
the US and your opinions of their current policy, and I believe that those 
<br>
points can be respectfully discussed and debated without either side 
<br>
resorting to cheap shots. Your initial post said:
<br>
<p>&quot;What *I* want to see is an international poll to see what percentage of 
<br>
people in the world think that if the international community fails to act 
<br>
firmly now against the UNITED STATES, then the world will become a more 
<br>
dangerous place in years to come?&quot;
<br>
<p>So again, regardless of whether or not as Ron suggests you are advocating 
<br>
loss of life for American citizens, you ARE suggesting that the United States 
<br>
is somehow the most dangerous force in the world. I find this contention hard 
<br>
to swallow, given that NO COUNTRY has done more to spread the causes of 
<br>
democracy and prosperity in the world than the United States. 
<br>
<p>&quot;But then again, what does public opinion REALLY have to do with what's going 
<br>
<p>on in the world today.... seems to me like the ones in power don't care to 
<br>
listen to reason, care for peace, or care to stop or lessen the REAL 
<br>
suffering in the world. $#^@% all this stuff about 'perceived threats', 
<br>
sheesh!&quot;
<br>
<p>In regard to this statement, it seems obvious (and again, correct me if I'm 
<br>
wrong) that you are referring specifically to the current Bush 
<br>
administration. Now, every charge you make is certainly more applicable to 
<br>
Saddam Hussein's regime than that of the democratic United States. Yet, you 
<br>
seem fully comfortable in allowing Mr. Hussein to retain power. So, you will 
<br>
have to forgive myself, Ron, and others if we feel the need to question your 
<br>
arguments.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
