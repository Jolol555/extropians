<em>&gt; &gt; Fox makes it quite clear that they hope the American side

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Would you rather have a network that pretended to be neutral 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but really was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But that is exactly what FOX does! It's billed as neutral when it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not. &quot;News without the spin,&quot; they say. 
</em><br>
<p>Untrue. FOX presents itself as presenting both (or more) sides of an
<br>
issue, which is markedly different than, say, exclusively the Dan
<br>
Rather side of every issue only. FOX openly states when it is
<br>
editorializing. Mainstream media like Dan Rather editorialize in every
<br>
word and phrase yet call it journalism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then you really do want distorted information, war [is] full of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pizzazz and excitement and heated emotions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm referring to the journalism itself, not to the events reported. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Example: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yesterday 3/28 Neil Cavuto responded on the air to a professor who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had complained (correctly, imo) that Neil Cavuto &quot;wears his bias 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on his sleeve.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>At least Cavuto does not deny that he has a bias. People like the
<br>
professor claim to be unbiased because they cannot concieve that
<br>
anything but their own position can have any credibility. I watched the
<br>
below referenced program and I gotta say, based on the letter the
<br>
professor wrote to Cavuto, Neil's response was entirely warranted. I
<br>
know professors like that, and I'll bet that since Neil said the prof
<br>
was from an Ivy League college that he works about 4 miles up the road
<br>
from me. 
<br>
<p>These are professors like that Columbia University Professor who said
<br>
yesterday that we need more Mogadishu-like massacres of US soldiers.
<br>
Such bias is quite evident. Imagine, instead, if the CU professor had
<br>
said something like &quot;What we need is more lynchings of these black
<br>
civil rights advocates.&quot; That guy would be fired within an hour.
<br>
Instead, we've got the CU president using intellectual freedom as a
<br>
cover.
<br>
<p>I'll note here that you don't seem to be quoting anything the professor
<br>
said in his letter to Cavuto. Such is evidence of bias.
