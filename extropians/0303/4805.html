<p>### Yes, this is correct, although you would still have the free-rider
<br>
problem - people who would sign up with PPO's which had no mutual
<br>
defense contracts, and therefore would be cheaper. The other PPO's would
<br>
need to maintain extra forces, verify to each other and to their
<br>
customers that the forces really exist and are battle-worthy, and this
<br>
would impose additional direct and transaction costs. Making sure that
<br>
your combined PPO army is any good would be pretty tricky without an
<br>
occasional war, too.
<br>
<p>One partial solution is for the PPO's to band together to destroy
<br>
competitors unwilling to participate in the general defense fund (but
<br>
this would make them somewhat similar to a territorial state), and to
<br>
pass the names of individuals without PPO contracts to criminals (who
<br>
would gleefully prey on them, discouraging from free-riding). As a
<br>
result you would still have the competition that makes capitalism work,
<br>
since users would choose the best of the PPO's capable of participating
<br>
in the general defense fund (the super-PPO), and the monopolist part of
<br>
the system would be reduced to only one aspect of the society. But it
<br>
wouldn't quite be anarchocapitalism anymore.
<br>
--------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not an anarcho-capitalist myself, but I'm pretty sympathetic to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; idea - and thinking of how it could work is just plain fun.
</em><br>
<p>### Yes!
