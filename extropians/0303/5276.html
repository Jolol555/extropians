Brett, I certainly appreciate your moderation attempt. But hey, you know,
<br>
there is a war going on and there are people here on this list who ardently
<br>
defend this criminal action. As long as there are US patriots on this list
<br>
who defend the law of the strongest and willingly accept the deaths of their
<br>
own soldiers and ten times as much Iraqui *casualties* I will choose any
<br>
ways and means to protest against this point of view. My resort to a common
<br>
visceral reaction was harmless and even POLITE in contrast to the disgusting
<br>
collateral damage our patriots here are willing to accept. I think I must
<br>
resort to a tougher language pretty soon.
<br>
<p>Look what they (the patriots) made me do. Sorry for the inconvenience in
<br>
these times of war.

Subject: Can we have a civilization please?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Extropes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This list brings together thoughtful intelligent people from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different parts of the world all of whom have some things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in common. I don't know that everybody that posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here would chose to describe themselves as an extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I do suspect that most would find some resonance with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the ExI Principles or with the discussions that normally take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place here, otherwise why would they be here?R
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally I don't think that people who have an affinity with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Extropian Principles are going to see their aspirations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fulfilled by looking to find an oasis from the realities of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wider world but similarly we here are for the most part not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the prime instigators of the problems most of us see in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wider world either. Let's make our points, lets be critical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of society, of policy and of our own ideas, but let's not forget
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that simply because we talk mostly about what we disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about, there is a great deal that we do agree about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's say for argument sake that a particular future that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crystallised is one where radical life extension does not arrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in time for this generation to be &quot;immortalised&quot; without a period
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of &quot;dormancy&quot; or &quot;stasis&quot;. That instead intelligent technology is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trawling through the records of conversations had on the internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a view to deciding which folks should be &quot;re-animated&quot; first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or even can be safely &quot;re-animated&quot; at all. In a time when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current circumstances of the world have moved on and all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that intelligence is looking for is the way we conducted ourselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that time would the posts that we make now stand in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; favour then?R
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is one thing to imagine a beneficent future intelligence willing to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; give its predecessors a chance at further experience. Its quite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another to imagine that that intelligence would want to re-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activate every single vector of bigotry, small-mindedness and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; meanness.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not saying that that is what is being evidenced on this list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or indeed other lists whose participants are finding themselves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engaging on the issues of the day with more than the usual amount
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of emotion and vitriol. I am saying that what we say is going onto
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a record and we might do well to consider that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On this list we are networked in some ways into the realities of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other. Current circumstances being emotionally charged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide excellent opportunities to learn, to better understand and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to look for solutions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Civilization is a bootstrapping process. Let's find ways to be part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the forward momentum and try not to be part of the drag.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regard,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brett Paatsch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ps: Now I really am off (not just the soapbox) but for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weekend.
