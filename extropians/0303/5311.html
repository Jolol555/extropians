<p>Ron objected:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Whereas I am annoyed by hearing my President and country slandered by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; left wing propagandist masquerading as an intelligent person.
</em><br>
<p>Wow, never hoped I would get away with the slightest approximation of being
<br>
an intelligent person. But I can reassure you: I am not intelligent at all,
<br>
I simply develloped a certain skill using and abusing the language of
<br>
similar thinking people and pretending they are my own thoughts. If some
<br>
bona fide people confuse this jester strategy as an indicator of
<br>
intelligence, well I don't mind.
<br>
<p>But talking about your President...you seem to belong to the endangered
<br>
species of &quot;Bushianus adorantus&quot; which soon might be renamed into &quot;Bushianus
<br>
Battle-of-Baghdad-looserianus&quot;.
<br>
<p>Sorry though for my lack of knowledge to apply professional taxonomy Latin.
<br>
I would certainly appreciate if some pacifist smartass could correct the
<br>
terms I want to mediate.
