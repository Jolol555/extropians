<em>&gt; I believe it is a tongue in cheek humourous statement designed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remind people constantly of just how badly the French stabbed us 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the back!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>What sort of mental processing is involved in 'believing' I wonder.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The average American doesn't buy very many French products that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're aware at least.  So by constantly reminding themselves and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others of what was done by the French they feed the MEME and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get others who do buy French products to think twice about who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they're supporting.
</em><br>
<p>A bit of rethinking, or even just one pass at critical thinking, in the
<br>
present circumstances, might indeed be a healthy thing. 
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would also be appropriate for prostitutes who currently refer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to oral sex as French to relabel that act Freedom.  And to perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take the act known as Greek and relabel it French in honor of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they did to us. Somehow I don't think Greece will mind.
</em><br>
<p>Somehow indeed. Greece is a country it does not have one &quot;mind&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Even when decisions are made in the name of a nation, be that nation
<br>
the United States of America, France or Australia, they are in the 
<br>
end made at the judgement (good or bad, after consultation and 
<br>
advice or not) of one mind, the mind of the head of state.  
<br>
<p>Judgements exist, or can exist, in the individual mind, but some seem
<br>
to prefer not to exercise such judgement. They prefer to believe.
