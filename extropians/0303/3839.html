On February 26, 2003, the Toronto Transhumanist Association hosted a talk by
<br>
Canadian cryonics expert, Ben Best, titled, &quot;Can Cryonics Save Your Life?&quot;
<br>
The talk was held at the Parliament library from 6:30 until 8:15 PM.
<br>
<p>Interest and attendance was very good; we even had one attendee fly in from
<br>
Montreal to attend the talk.
<br>
<p>Ben Best is the President of the Cryonics Society of Canada and President &amp;
<br>
Secretary of CryoCare Foundation. Ben was also involved in the very first
<br>
cyronics case in Ontario last year. We were honoured to have a speaker of
<br>
Ben's caliber come out for a TTA event.
<br>
<p>Ben spoke for nearly 2 hours and addressed a wide variety of topics. He
<br>
spoke of the science behind cryonics, the state of the industry, recent
<br>
innovations, and the battle against aging. Ben also tied in a number of
<br>
Transhumanist themes into his talk, including posthumanism, his optimistic
<br>
view of the future, and the eventual goal of ending aging. He also fielded
<br>
some challenging questions, and dealt with a number of difficult issues
<br>
head-on.
<br>
<p>After the talk a number of us relocated next door to the local pub where we
<br>
had a few pints and discussed cyborgization, wearables (including recording
<br>
devices), the nature of the human mind and consciousness, and
<br>
life-extension.
<br>
<p>All in all, it was an excellent and stimulating evening. The TTA would like
<br>
to sincerely thank Ben for volunteering his time and expertise.

everyone else's satisfy me less.&quot;
