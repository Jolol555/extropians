<p><em>&gt;Yes. As Anders points out, these people are not anti-cloning, nor do they

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;pro-death, pro-suffering, pro-disease, pro-aging (all of which, again, has
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;bioethicists and hangers-on are in essence Statists, they believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perfectly fine to use the engine of the State to coerce, force and impose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In other words, they advocate and *actively work towards* mass murder on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scale dwarfing anything that humans have &quot;achieved&quot; to date.

</em><br>
<em>&gt;As Anders also points out, they are doing a better job of killing

</em><br>
<p><p>Ok, it's obvious that you both have given this topic FAR more thought than I
<br>
have.
<br>
<p>Previously I had imagined these biofundies were not a serious threat because
<br>
I couldn't see how anyone might effectively stem the tide of scientific
<br>
progress - a perspective which predicted trans/posthumanism as the logical
<br>
end result of progress. This conclusion was supported by the fact that,
<br>
while Kass IS the President's chief bioethicist, funding for NBIC science
<br>
continues unabated, and is clearly on the rise. These two facts seem to be
<br>
at odds if one postulates the existence an all encompassing technoscientific
<br>
meta-policy which is the only regulatory model I could conceive of that
<br>
might seriously throttle progress. That one arm of the government is driving
<br>
progress forward at breakneck speed, while another is sourly pecking away at
<br>
the most contentious ethical issues, led me to the perhaps hasty conclusion
<br>
that such a meta-policy does not (and perhaps cannot) exist.
<br>
<p>Yet your words, taken in the context of the present American led drive
<br>
toward near-term globalization, do indeed ring a warning. I have been forced
<br>
to ask myself - might the process of evolution itself be hijacked by this
<br>
kind of irrationality?
<br>
<p>And the answer I come up with is an unsettling MAYBE.
<br>
<p>Therefore I'm in on this fight, though sadly I'm distracted by the
<br>
ever-pressing need to accumulate a small quantity of those damnable social
<br>
tickets in order to alleviate such mehum concerns as food and heat, and
<br>
child size bicycle helmets. But if you are dead serious about fighting, and
<br>
it seems you are, AND if we can come up with a viable plan to mobilize
<br>
against this FukuKass mindset (polite nod to Natasha's aborted ProAct
<br>
effort) which ALSO has the potential to generate a few bucks on the side,
<br>
I'll throw myself into it 100%.
<br>
<p>I does seem logical to presume that more than a few corporate entities might
<br>
be willing to fund this particular fight, no?
