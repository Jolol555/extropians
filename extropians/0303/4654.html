<em>&gt; Sure, but there's a vast sea of difference between body dismorphic

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Sure. I have a friend who has modified herself quite a bit and is quite
<br>
happy about it (she is currently writing a &gt;H book about her
<br>
experiences). But the problem is that this discussion seems to assume
<br>
that the vast majority of people are very rational about their bodies,
<br>
and there is a tiny minority who isn't. The evidence rather points
<br>
towards a wide distribution. Just the issue of how our bodies really
<br>
look is extremely subjective, and people often have quite divergent
<br>
ideas about their own appearance - somthing that should rationally be
<br>
easy to determine. And their evaluation of that appearance is even more
<br>
variable. 
<br>
<p>Introducing technology that enable bodychange will make people reduce
<br>
the distance between their current bodies and their current ideal
<br>
bodies, but the subjective experience will be a change in subjectively
<br>
perceived bodies (how they think they look) - which could go in any
<br>
direction. As long as body change technology isn't super-trivial, this
<br>
will cause pain and confusion.
<br>
<p>We have to analyse these issues well, since a simple way of dismissing
<br>
transhumanist ideas is just to call them a result of BDD or being
<br>
brainwashed by the cultural hegemony into a body-denying belief system. 
<br>
But there is a fundamental difference (even if there are certainly
<br>
transhumanists who does fit in with the above criticism too). 
<br>
Transhumanism is not seeking to create perfect bodies, not even 
<br>
individually perfect bodies. The goal is rather to enable *improving* 
<br>
our bodies, with the realization that there will be something beyond 
<br>
Primo 3M too. It is not a process that should ever have to end, and it 
<br>
is not guaranteed to lead to eternal happiness. It is more about eternal 
<br>
growth and change.
