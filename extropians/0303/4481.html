<br>
I would also be interested, however, in seeing a similiar list of rights
<br>
lost
<br>
by the people of south vietnam when the communist North Vietmanese finally
<br>
overtook the south directly because of the US abandoment of the region.
<br>
(An abandoment, which I remind you, that you found just) Any interest in
<br>
compiling such a list Samantha?
<br>
<p>&quot;Screw Vietnam.&quot;
<br>
<p>Well that certainly seems to be the general attitude of most Americans, then
<br>
and now.  Who cares?  They arent people, right?  Never mind that millions of
<br>
Indochinese people were slaughtered and enslaved.  They werent Americans, we
<br>
didnt know any of them, right?
<br>
<p>&quot;Let the Vietnamese compile their own lists.&quot;
<br>
<p>They probably would if they didnt have to worry about being killed for it.
<br>
Im sure such a list of lost rights just after the fall of saigon might have
<br>
read:
<br>
<p>- the right not to have your skull bashed in by the but of rifle
<br>
- the right to not have to dig your own grave before being executed as an
<br>
'enemy of the people'
<br>
- the right to propery, speech
<br>
- the right to not be enslaved and forced into peasant farming
<br>
- the right to life of nearly 1 million people
<br>
<p>A similiar list in cambodia might have added
<br>
<p>- The right to more than a quarter cup of rotten corn every day
<br>
- the right to express feelings of an emotional nature to loved ones (The
<br>
khmer rouge would often execute anyone for public displays of affection, as
<br>
it demonstrated that they valued something more than the state)
<br>
- the right to express sorrow at the news of the loss of a child without
<br>
being executed, a child who had been carted off to a distant slave labor
<br>
farm and surprisingly died despite his healthy quarter cup of rotten corn
<br>
every day (again, expressing grief at the loss of a child demonstrated that
<br>
someone loved themselves or their children more than the state)
<br>
- the right to life for 2 - 3 million cambodians
<br>
<p>- Excerpt -
<br>
<p>&quot;[Tan Samay's] pupils hanged him. A noose was passed around his neck; then
<br>
the rope was passed over the branch of a tree. Half a dozen children between
<br>
eight and ten years old held the loose end of the rope, pulling it sharply
<br>
three or four times, dropping it in between. All the while they were
<br>
shouting, &quot;Unfit teacher! Unfit teacher!&quot; until Tan Samay was dead. The
<br>
worst was that the children took obvious pleasure in killing.
<br>
----A Khmer Rouge execution &quot;
<br>
<p>AND
<br>
<p>&quot;The devastating history of Cambodia during the 1960s and 1970s is
<br>
intimately bound up with the Vietnam War. Communist North Vietnamese
<br>
provided military aid and soldiers to Cambodia's own communist guerrillas,
<br>
the Khmer Rouge or Red Cambodians. Cambodia was an avenue for war supplies
<br>
from North Vietnam to the Viet Cong guerrillas fighting under their command
<br>
in South Vietnam against South Vietnamese and American troops. As a result,
<br>
the United States systematically bombed Khmer Rouge guerrillas and Viet Cong
<br>
supply routes, and in a final attempt to destroy these routes, invaded
<br>
Cambodia from South Vietnam. But, American Congressional and public opinion
<br>
hostile to the invasion soon forced American forces to retreat back to South
<br>
Vietnam.
<br>
<p>In proportion to its population, Cambodia underwent a human catastrophe
<br>
unequaled by any other country in the twentieth century (see Figure 1.2 of
<br>
my Death By Government). It probably lost slightly less than 4,000,000
<br>
people to war, rebellion, manufactured famine, and democide--genocide,
<br>
nonjudicial executions, and massacres--or close to 56 percent of its 1970
<br>
population. Between 1970 and 1980, from democide alone, successive
<br>
governments and guerrilla groups murdered almost 3,300,000 men, women, and
<br>
children, including 35,000 foreigners. Most of these, probably as many as
<br>
2,400,000, were murdered by the communist Khmer Rouge, both before and (to a
<br>
much greater extent) when they took over Cambodia after April 1975. These
<br>
statistics are shown in Table 6.2 here.2
<br>
<p>The United States had supported and supplied the Cambodian military
<br>
government of General Lon Nol. But the American Congress ended all aid to
<br>
him with the withdrawal of the United States from the Vietnam War in 1973.
<br>
After successive retreats, Lon Nol could no longer even defend the capital,
<br>
Phnom Penh, against the Khmer Rouge guerrillas. The Cambodian army then
<br>
declared a cease-fire and laid down its arms. &quot;
<br>
<p>- end excerpt - from <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.CHAP6.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.CHAP6.HTM</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Sorry if I sound insensitive or selfish... it's probably because I am. And
<br>
precisely because of said selfishness, I do retain a keen interest in my
<br>
rights.&quot;
<br>
<p>I value my rights dearly as well.  Do you not also value the rights of other
<br>
human beings as well?
<br>
<p>&quot;So, power to you, Samantha. I definitely hope you keep your focus, get it
<br>
done soon, and make it known far and wide. The world (me especially) needs
<br>
to know!&quot;
<br>
<p>In this I also totally agree, If Samantha's list is accurate and objective,
<br>
by all means, spread it far and wide, I myself will be glad to spread the
<br>
link to her list as well.  The world does need to know, but the world also
<br>
needs to know the attrocities that befell the people of Indochina, the
<br>
attrocities caused by a general abandomnent of those people by the US at the
<br>
insistence of its people and its politicians to the hands of known terrible,
<br>
murderous, and horrific regimies.  Do we not value freedom for all peoples?
<br>
Some members of this list supported this abandonment and actually refer to
<br>
these events that followed as a 'victory for the good guys'
<br>
<p>&quot;Ignore the attacks from people who will go to any lengths and justify
<br>
anything under the sun for the sake of ideology.&quot;
<br>
<p>Do you mean to imply that I am 'going any length' to 'justify anything under
<br>
the sun'  Please read the above links of the hell that befell the cambodian
<br>
people and then try to determine what idealogy in particular I am trying to
<br>
promulgate at 'any lengths'
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
