<p><p>&lt;&lt;Report Generates Negative Energy 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p>If you're ever tempted to think that the city's messiest politics are found 
<br>
only on Capitol Hill, have a chat with energy expert Robert L. Hirsch, whose 
<br>
termination from the Rand Corp. last fall still rankles him. His 
<br>
behind-the-scenes tale of a policy report gone awry is awash in policy 
<br>
disagreements and charges and countercharges.
<br>
<p>Rand hired Hirsch in January 2001, and he began work on the report &quot;Energy 
<br>
Technologies for 2050,&quot; a $200,000 study commissioned by the Department of 
<br>
Energy's Fossil Energy Program. His mission was to develop a methodology that 
<br>
could be used to evaluate the viability of energy technologies over the next 
<br>
50 years. Then in October, Hirsch was fired.
<br>
<p>On that much, Hirsch and Rand agree. It's what happened in between that's 
<br>
controversial.
<br>
<p>Hirsch, now head of the National Research Council's Board on Energy and 
<br>
Environmental Systems, said Rand was trying to squash his report because its 
<br>
preliminary conclusions were unpalatable to DOE, Rand's client.
<br>
<p>&quot;When management plays around with you for a couple of weeks and then takes 
<br>
[your report] away to give it to somebody else and tells you that the report 
<br>
will go out without the two sections that offended people in DOE -- to me, 
<br>
that's prima facie evidence of a cover-up,&quot; Hirsch said. &quot;If that's not the 
<br>
case, I don't know what is.&quot;
<br>
<p>That wasn't the case to Rand. &quot;The problems were with the methodology, not 
<br>
the results,&quot; said James Dewar, a senior Rand official and methodology expert 
<br>
who shored up the report. &quot;If the methodology was sound and that's how the 
<br>
results came out, we'd have no problem. Rand certainly doesn't shy away from 
<br>
saying something uncomfortable to its clients.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the report, Hirsch, an engineer who has worked at DOE and Arco Oil and Gas 
<br>
Co., developed a preliminary methodology and tried it on three technologies: 
<br>
solar cells, fusion and coal gasification. His early conclusions were that 
<br>
coal gasification is close to being practical, fusion research is on the 
<br>
wrong track and solar cells are impractical for large-scale use.
<br>
<p>He said that rubbed DOE the wrong way, contending the agency is heavily 
<br>
invested in fusion and loath to be seen as being against renewable energy.
<br>
<p>A DOE spokesman said the agency did advise Rand of its concerns, but that 
<br>
these regarded the work's quality and &quot;a misapplication of the study's 
<br>
parameters.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Out-of-date data and inappropriate market assumptions led the analyst to 
<br>
reach strongly negative judgments for both photovoltaic and fusion,&quot; said a 
<br>
DOE summary of the study and controversy. &quot;While the study reached positive 
<br>
conclusions for the coal-based technology, its serious shortcomings in 
<br>
analyzing the other two technologies led [Fossil Energy] -- and subsequently 
<br>
other DOE offices -- to question the study's overall technical and analytical 
<br>
quality.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hirsch said he was abruptly fired for sharing a draft of the report, which he 
<br>
admits doing as a last resort, saying he feared the conclusions would not get 
<br>
out otherwise. Rand officials said they cannot comment on the reasons for the 
<br>
firing.
<br>
<p>&quot;Hirsch is an honorable guy and intellectually honest, and I think he was 
<br>
badly treated,&quot; said John McCaughey, a contributor to Electricity Daily 
<br>
newsletter and a friend of Hirsch's. &quot;The more important point is that a 
<br>
fantastic amount of taxpayers' money is being spent on things like this. . . 
<br>
. Hirsch's problem, in my opinion, was that he said the emperor has no 
<br>
clothes.&quot;
<br>
<p>Rand officials said there was never any discussion of deleting sections of 
<br>
the report. They said the problems arose because Hirsch's draft report did 
<br>
not meet Rand's quality standards and that Hirsch himself was unresponsive to 
<br>
constructive criticism from colleagues and reviewers. They also said Hirsch's 
<br>
findings were neither new nor politically sensitive.
<br>
<p>&quot;You know we're particularly sensitive to using the platform of what's 
<br>
supposed to be an analytical report as a soapbox for basically an op-ed piece 
<br>
or an opinion that's not grounded in analysis. And this was a concern in this 
<br>
case,&quot; said Rand's Debra Knopman.
<br>
<p>Hirsch now works as a senior energy program adviser for SAIC, a research and 
<br>
engineering company.
<br>
<p>&quot;The record shows I'm not an extremist,&quot; he said. &quot;I have an established 
<br>
record of credibility. . . . I found a flaw in Rand which was extremely 
<br>
disappointing, and I still don't understand how [they] could allow such a 
<br>
thing to happen.&quot;
<br>
<p>The report is still in rewrite. DOE expects to receive a new draft in the 
<br>
next several weeks.&gt;&gt;
