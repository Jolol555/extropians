</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>### You are right, Hoppe didn't address the free-rider problem at all.
<br>
The solution I thought about and speculated on previously on this
<br>
thread, is essentially formation of a cartel of security providers who
<br>
require war defense clauses as part of any private security agreement.
<br>
The cartel would not prevent competition by a threat of military action,
<br>
and thus would differ from a state.
<br>
<p>The question is, what are the conditions for the stability of such a
<br>
cartel?
<br>
<p>I think that it would require a substantial uniformity among the
<br>
customers, far from 100% (where the free rider problem would not exist
<br>
at all) but probably much more than the 51% needed theoretically in a
<br>
majoritarian democracy for a motion to succeed, or the 10 - 15 %
<br>
sufficient in some despotisms. 
<br>
<p>It is possible to achieve such levels of voluntary uniformity if the
<br>
goals of a political system are modest (e.g. only strictly defined
<br>
defense), and the majority is willing to sanction non-cooperators. The
<br>
College of Hortators comes to mind, where a sufficiently large group of
<br>
property owners decides to abide voluntarily by some rules, and sanction
<br>
non-cooperators by excluding them from commercial interactions. 
<br>
<p>This system would work in the transparent society, if the cartel's
<br>
supporters gained sufficient credibility by sticking to the embargoes
<br>
they enact on non-cooperators. In a secrecy-driven society there would
<br>
be too much defection from the Hortators. 
<br>
<p>So, again, if the above is true, then (voluntary) transparency is *the*
<br>
answer to the problems of radical libertarianism, in keeping with the
<br>
results from game theory, where cooperative games are aided by
<br>
increasing the verifiability of promises.
