</em><br>
<p>That's just an US media thing. The POW video was aired by most of European
<br>
TVs. Here in Italy, a minor TV station decided to give about 12 hours/day
<br>
of coverage about the Iraq war. They also re-broadcast many CNN and Al
<br>
Jazeera videos, and aired the POW video from Al Jazeera in realtime,
<br>
followed shortly after by the Rumsfeld interview.
<br>
<p>For some still picture, look here:
