<p><em>&gt; &gt; My heartiest warm puke-soaked wishes,

<p>Same to you, Mike. One last thing: what does an above-average intelligent
<br>
person feel and think if he sees and hears your President standing on a
<br>
stage together with war veterans, smiling this false smile, executing this
<br>
revealing body language while addressing his army, binding them to even more
<br>
sacrifices with statements like bringing peace to Iraq?
<br>
<p>Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.
<br>
<p>To me, puking as hard as I can is the visceral reaction of my choice. There
<br>
is nothing wrong with it. It is the very first step of a denial to keep on
<br>
living with annoying situations like this one. But talking about puking and
<br>
imagining what can be done with barrels of it to lubricate the US war
<br>
machine seems to be a greater taboo than to calculate on *casualties* - a
<br>
nice clinical clean term.
<br>
<p>If you already feel excited about someone offering you his puke, what do you
<br>
feel when you see intestines falling out of the belly of a four year old
<br>
Iraqui girl, a daily incident that you cold-bloodedly accept when you
<br>
promote this war of aggression.
