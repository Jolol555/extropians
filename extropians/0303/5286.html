<br>
<p><em>         &gt;It's highly sensationalized news reporting.  Kinda' exciting, I
</em><br>
<em>         &gt;would agree, but hardly unbiased!
</em><br>
<p>Fox makes it quite clear that they hope the American side wins, but at least
<br>
they put all their cards on the table. Would you rather have a network that
<br>
pretended to be neutral but really was not; would you rather have a network
<br>
that suffered from moral imbecility to such a degree that it really did see
<br>
a moral equivalence between the American and Iraqi side?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; CNN is boring by comparison, but in my view news SHOULD be boring.
</em><br>
<p>If your coverage makes war look boring then you have distorted information.
<br>
Face the truth, war is horrible, war is evil, but war is not boring.
<br>
<p><em>      &gt; I don't  want pizzazz and excitement and heated emotions.
</em><br>
<p>Then you really do want distorted information, war if full of pizzazz and
<br>
excitement and heated emotions.
