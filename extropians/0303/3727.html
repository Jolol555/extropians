</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;just on aging but in other areas too. In truth, I'm disappointed with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;what's being done and I want to know why are transhumanists so
</em><br>
<em>&gt;confident we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;will reach the singularity. For instance, astrophysics and space
</em><br>
<em>&gt;exploration have been stagnating. It's been 30 years since a man walked on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the moon and, though I'm not an expert, I don't see how our recent models
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the universe--e.g. superstring theory--are more likely to be right than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the models from Einstein's time. It's true breakthroughs have been made in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;biology and medicine, such as the Human Genome Project, but, shit, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;haven't even cured AIDS, how can we expect to cure aging anytime soon?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Also, I'm disappointed with the way science is made in the academia with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;personal egos rising above finding the mechanisms of aging. If we want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cure aging, we need to work together, but not many do that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;In the end, I would say that the basis for the singularity is Moore's law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for it allows not only faster computers but also developments in DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sequencing and a host of other possibilities. Yet I'm sure there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;physical limits for Moore's law. When will we reach them? Can you be sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Moore's law will continue for long enough to develop a smarter-than-man
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artificial intelligence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;When I found transhumanism, already several years ago, I thought it set an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;optimistic but plausible scenario. Now, I'm starting to wonder if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;we're not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just another cult willing to sacrifice reality towards a fairer image of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the world. Please prove me wrong. Or does anyone here thinks we're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;descendant from aliens?
</em><br>
<p><p>Ok I'll take a stab at this.
<br>
<p>Picture a small plastic funnel - the type you might use to get salt into the
<br>
hole in the bottom of a salt shaker. Now turn the funnel on its side, forget
<br>
about the shaker, and increase the funnel's overall dimensions by a factor
<br>
of, say 30 - a great big honking plastic funnel you now have there.
<br>
<p>Now go outside and mount it securely on the handlebars of your motorcycle
<br>
with the big end facing forward and the narrow end perfectly aligned with
<br>
your forehead when you're seated on the bike - you might want to cut a small
<br>
slot just below the neck of the funnel so you can see where you're going.
<br>
<p>Got it? Now stretch your mind a bit here and imagine that all information -
<br>
all facts, memes, ideas, methods, books, websites, theories, proofs etc. can
<br>
be represented as individual winged insects. Thus that fly over there is a
<br>
method for making excellent chocolate chip cookies, that mosquito - a plan
<br>
for a nuclear reactor core, that moth - the correct tire pressure for a
<br>
Formula One race car running on concrete at 97 degrees F surface
<br>
temperature, etc.
<br>
<p>If you have a problem with conceptualizing a nuclear reactor as a single
<br>
mosquito, then pretend the mosquito's cells represent all the sub-bits of
<br>
information which go into making a device of that complexity. Forget about
<br>
scale here, it's not at all essential to the point I'm trying to make. The
<br>
purpose of the experiment is to have the bugs enter the funnel and slam
<br>
directly into your brain to thereby become part of your acquired knowledge
<br>
base.
<br>
<p>Now hop on this monstrous vehicle you have created and let's go cruising. I
<br>
suppose we'll have to assume you already have enough &quot;bugs&quot; in your head to
<br>
balance and operate the vehicle safely. Before you leave your driveway, a
<br>
ladybug enters the funnel and you acquire the good sense to check the street
<br>
for oncoming traffic.
<br>
<p>Now suppose I set no other restrictions besides allowing *one thousand gas
<br>
fill-ups* for your entire journey and all the bugs you catch must be trapped
<br>
via your own personal funnel (i.e. no stopping in at that smelly Mexican
<br>
flesh-eating fly hatchery etc.)
<br>
<p>Ok, so if you want to increase your overall intelligence, there are a number
<br>
of variables that might be considered.
<br>
<p>1. You might choose to return home and increase the size of your funnel -
<br>
I'll allow that!
<br>
2. You might drive faster to increase your rate of capture - here's a free
<br>
radar detector.
<br>
3. You might plan your journey so as to pass by as many swamps, garbage
<br>
dumps, grassy fields etc. as possible.
<br>
4. Or you might turn on your headlight and drive around only at dusk or
<br>
early in the morning in late spring - take all the time you need.
<br>
<p>So here are my conclusions:
<br>
<p>Fact: You will never catch all the bugs, or even make a dent in the total
<br>
the bug population.
<br>
<p>Fact: You will never know the information contained in the bugs you missed.
<br>
<p>Fact: Even though you didn't notice any other Funnel Riders along the way,
<br>
you don't know what bugs other people might be catching.
<br>
<p>Fact: You haven't read the Age of Spiritual Machines carefully enough, or
<br>
have utterly failed to grasp the significance of the &quot;Law of Accelerating
<br>
Returns&quot;.
