<p>Ja, but Amara, honestly I find connecting with humans
<br>
quite difficult enough without the additional complication
<br>
of nudity.  Such a complicated operating system we have!
<br>
I try to imagine myself nude on the beach trying to
<br>
strike up a conversation with another bare person.  I
<br>
would find that just damn near impossible.
<br>
<p>I guess it goes back to an old topic that we hashed
<br>
over about 3 yrs ago: we have certain social
<br>
programming that is nearly impossible to turn off,
<br>
even with a strong will to do so.
<br>
<p>Note that I am not in the least objecting to naturists.
<br>
Im currently reading one of my favorite authors, TC Boyle,
<br>
whose new book Drop City is about naturists, sort of.
<br>
TC Boyle fans, this is a good one, actually about a
<br>
hippie commune from the 60s.  It isn't a parody, doesn't
<br>
make fun of hippies, but it is delightfully dark comedy.
<br>
<p>After reading this list, Kerouac, Broderick, Boyle et.al.,
<br>
I have begun to realize that something very important happened
<br>
in the west in the 60s.  I do not understand what it
<br>
was exactly, but it was important.  I see something like
<br>
the 60s happening in the middle east in the next ten years.
<br>
I *hope* thats the way it turns out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Consider this: if one can't accept their human body (accepting

<p>Do I get to design it?  {8-]  spike
