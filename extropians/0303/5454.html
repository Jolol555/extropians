Damien said:
<br>
&lt;&lt;They're opposed to us attacking another nation, not opposing their own 
<br>
nations
<br>
being involved.  Well, that too, but the main concern is about the attack.
<br>
And these are people who were sympathetic with us after 9/11, and were okay
<br>
with the attack on the Taliban and al Qaeda.  Because there was a connection
<br>
between 9/11 and al Qaeda, the way there isn't with Iraq.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>They are opposed to us messing with their business partner, Saddam. They are 
<br>
opposed to a militarilly powerful United States, that cannot be controlled by 
<br>
their common will (obey us!). Their sympathy for 9-11 was a kilometre wide 
<br>
and a micron deep. That Chirac, on 9-12 said &quot;We are all Americans, today&quot; is 
<br>
as questionable as a check in the mail, assertion. Actions speak louder then 
<br>
words, and the protection of Iraq that France and so many others have tried 
<br>
to afford a tyrant; a leader who has assisted and armed and nutured our worst 
<br>
enemy,(Osama and the Islamists-not a 50's rock band!) is the loudest voice of 
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Mass protests across the world based on lining their pockets?&gt;&gt; 
<br>
No they hate America's, not our government's, but America's guts. Many 
<br>
must've been ( I conclude) thrilled by the 9-11 attack, though probably 
<br>
demure about voicing such a joy.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Remember Le Monde's headline &quot;We are all Americans&quot; after 9/11?  Some 
<br>
hatred
<br>
there.  Maybe, instead of hatred, they fear a giant developing a victim
<br>
mentality and turning into a blundering bully.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Again, phonier than a 3- franc bill, in my opinion. They fear us screwing up 
<br>
their cozy relationship with the Islamists, which is something I also accuse 
<br>
Bush Sr. of  of cultivating. Bush and Baker caved into Saudi pressure back in 
<br>
1991, and thousands of Shiites were slaughtered by dear, Saddam.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Blair's dossier on Iraq was widely reported as plagiarized; claims of Iraq
<br>
buying uranium from Niger are from forged documents.  Not saying we did
<br>
the forging ourselves, but we used them, despite CIA skepticism&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Uranium is not, nor ever was the central issue. Not when the CIA, under its 
<br>
own steam, seemed to possess information regarding Saddam's ownership, 
<br>
despite the 1991 truce that his ministers signed, promising to disown 
<br>
biological and chemical weapons. All this, Tony Blair, not withstanding. It 
<br>
the bio and chem weapons that have prompted Bush assualt on Iraq, not nukes, 
<br>
not yet.  You have been reading or viewing about several thousand Tox suits 
<br>
and atropine injectors being found? Or do you believe that to be a CIA 
<br>
mannipulation?
