<a href="mailto:gts_2000@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20(MEDIA)%20More%20enthusiasm%20than%20news%20in%20Fox's%20coverage%20of%20war">gts_2000@yahoo.com</a> writes: I do agree with you that one would need to be 
<br>
wearing rose-colored glasses to not see that oil is at least one of the 
<br>
important factors driving this war.
<br>
<p>GTS,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your statement almost cannot help but be true in some sense.  The 
<br>
problem is that it is such a blanket statement that a large number of 
<br>
specific statements could fit under that same blanket.  For example, I have 
<br>
to agree that the outcome of the war will have a large effect on the oil 
<br>
market of the world in some sense.  What if the Iraqis hold free elections 
<br>
and then decide they don't want to sell oil to those countries that played 
<br>
footsie with the Sadaam Hussein regime.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have also heard it said that the Iraqi oil drilling and 
<br>
transportation system is antiquated.  As a result it is suggested that a post 
<br>
war Iraq oil supply system that was brought up to modern standards could 
<br>
triple the amount of oil they have sold over the past ten years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am sure many people can foresee the possible changes in the oil 
<br>
market far better than I can so I need to see a much more specific statement 
<br>
of what you had in mind.
<br>
