<em>&gt; If you mean that the stats above (given by the WHO daily) are going to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; New York has 8 suspected cases.
</em><br>
<p>I mean that you appear to think you know something about the rate of new 
<br>
cases, but you talk about the raw number, not the rate or rate of change; 
<br>
and you seem to think that it's nothing to worry about. I encapsulate that 
<br>
as &quot;Most of the time nothing happens.&quot;
<br>
<p>Whereas I wonder if it's too soon to tell, since I don't know anything to 
<br>
speak of regarding incubation, onset and progress and &quot;too soon to tell&quot; is 
<br>
an old prudent Chinese saying. And &quot;wash your hands and keep your fingers 
<br>
out of your mouth!&quot; is old guidance from my upbringing that I've come to 
<br>
not follow ('cause, hey, I've never  *died* from it yet--typical monkey 
<br>
thinking), and am now promoting. Capsule form: &quot;It ain't the fall that 
<br>
kills you, it's the sudden acceleration at the end.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am wondering about your simple population
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pattern diffusion model. Could you explain to me your model please? Or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps you only meant to say that infectious diseases are so called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are infectious and will spread in a population?
</em><br>
<p>My calling it a &quot;model&quot; was probably a bit grandiose. I'll probably now use 
<br>
fifty words where ten should do. Epidemiologists probably have a three word 
<br>
phrase for it. It's a a kind of social mean-free-path notion.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that those people with a low value for &quot;degrees of 
<br>
separation&quot; from Hong Kong and other areas with a high number of reported 
<br>
cases, and with &quot;frequent flyer&quot; mobility, also have a low value for 
<br>
&quot;degrees of separation&quot; to menbers of other population centers with large 
<br>
Asian populations; and thus, those places might evolve as potential 
<br>
secondary concentrations of cases or become epidemic foci (if that's an 
<br>
appropriate term). Hong Kong and San Francisco used to be almost sister 
<br>
cities, and SF and Oakland have a lot of connections, too.
<br>
<p>I used the funny wording out of a remanent fear of being called some sort 
<br>
of bigot. Sorry. There's a lot of namecalling on the list of late.
