<p><em>&gt; My view of the current [American] President is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was not elected by the people and should never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have made it to the White House. 
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense.  He played by the rules which, in our case
<br>
are in accordance with the Electoral College.  Or are
<br>
you talking about the hotly contested Florida election?
<br>
Well, someone had to decide who was going to be president
<br>
(i.e., how the rules were going to be interpreted because
<br>
in the U.S. the time is long past where mere innocents
<br>
can know what the law says).  It turned out that it was
<br>
going to be either the Florida Supreme court, or the 
<br>
U.S. Supreme Court, and the latter ruled against the former.
<br>
That's all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is all an aside as my original post was simply a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question as to &quot;how do you remove a person from elected
</em><br>
<em>&gt; office in the US?&quot;  My question was in order to give me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a better understanding of what safety guards are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place to stop someone like Any President from doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something utterly mad?
</em><br>
<p>The President can be impeached, (which means that a certain
<br>
kind of vote takes place.  Clinton was the only president
<br>
since the time of the Civil War to be impeached.  After this
<br>
step, he can legally be removed from office, though I am 
<br>
foggy on the details.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, breaking international law, illegally invading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another country or even forcing the country to follow a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course of action that is against the wishes of the majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the public and could conceivably start a second cold war. 
</em><br>
<p>First, no president (or Prime Minister for that matter) ever
<br>
gets elected who is not a &quot;team player&quot;.  So in true cases
<br>
of delusional behavior or incipient insanity, the leader in
<br>
question alienates his own people first.  No President can
<br>
order, for example, the arrest of a Congress person; the order
<br>
simply would not be carried out by any sane General.
<br>
<p>Second, one does *not* want---as you seem to suggest---that
<br>
the PM or President instantly respond to what &quot;a majority
<br>
of the public&quot; wants.  The majority of the people is a 
<br>
fleeting thing, a mob often prone to demagoguery or to being
<br>
taken in by surface appearances.
<br>
<p>When you write &quot;international law&quot; and &quot;illegally&quot; invading
<br>
another country, you seem to be suggesting that national
<br>
sovereignty no longer exists.  That is, of course, far from
<br>
the truth.
