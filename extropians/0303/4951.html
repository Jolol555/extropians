</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>### Sorry, I meant &quot; PPOs without war defense clauses&quot;. A partial
<br>
defense, not including nuclear weapons, no assured nuclear deterrence,
<br>
no defense against armored attacks, etc.
<br>
<p>Andrew Clough made a good suggestion, that PPOs might include
<br>
requirement for war defense in their general mutual defense agreements,
<br>
which might indeed result in the elimination (peaceful) of unworthy
<br>
competitors, as long as the majority of customers wanted war defense to
<br>
begin with. Only after the majority of customers became totally
<br>
unwilling to pay for nukes, would this situation change.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, the more PPOs joined such
<br>
<em>&gt; agreements, the more criminals would tend to prey on those who used PPOs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without such agreements.  I'm actually not sure why you believe PPOs with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutual defense contracts would be more expensive, anyway?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pass the names of individuals without PPO contracts to criminals (who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would gleefully prey on them, discouraging from free-riding). As a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; result you would still have the competition that makes capitalism work,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wouldn't it make more sense for them to publish a list of those who had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contracts with them, instead (subject to the customer's willingness to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on such a list, of course)?  After all, how could they be sure that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual doesn't have a PPO contract with someone, somewhere?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, you are right, although if criminals were willing to pay for
<br>
help with compiling lists of non-covered persons, the PPO could
<br>
cooperate there. A criminal considering an attack would first ask all
<br>
major PPOs whether a particular individual is covered (maybe not all
<br>
PPOs would answer, depending on their customer's attitudes toward
<br>
free-riders and criminals), then approach the individual to confirm lack
<br>
of coverage, and proceed to shoot and pillage according to his
<br>
assessment of relative firepower.
<br>
<p>Actually, I am starting to believe this could work.
