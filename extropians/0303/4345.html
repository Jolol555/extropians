<br>
<p>Forwarding the private reply of Tom Van Flandern - twc: 
<br>
<p>***** Terry, 
<br>
<p>I propose this as my last contribution to this discussion, with the possible
<br>
exception of one or two challenges I left for Ron Ebert. We’ve largely drifted
<br>
away from science and into side issues and personal belief systems. Ron can have
<br>
the last word, and I’m content to close on that. 
<br>
<p>[tvf]: You seemed to imply that, if four points selected from the bottom 
<br>
2/3 of the &gt;list were questionable, the remaining 26 (unseen by you) points
<br>
probably are &gt;questionable too. Do you agree, then, that would be an invalid
<br>
generalization? 
<br>
<p>[re]: Yes. I can't address claims if I don't know what they are. Since I don't,
<br>
I &gt;have nothing to say about them. 
<br>
<p>So we are not really discussing my paper and my arguments, but just four points
<br>
from someone else's news note about my paper. To determine whether or not the
<br>
Big Bang has been credibly challenged, you would need to read the original paper
<br>
and the complete list of problems, especially the top ten. 
<br>
<p>So in other words, in your opinion these four points aren't a credible challenge
<br>
to the Big Bang? I guess if I wanted to keep arguing with you I would take the
<br>
effort to find the paper somewhere and read it. Or if you want to keep arguing
<br>
with me you can forward it to me. But most skeptics know that there is little
<br>
hope in changing the viewpoints of cranks. We argue with them to show onlookers
<br>
that their ideas are false. I think I've made that point by now, but further
<br>
argument with you would strengthen it. 
<br>
<p>[tvf]: Raising the level of your protest to a shrill &quot;patently false&quot;, even if
<br>
you &gt;added a declaration that the Mars hypothesis contradicts the Word of God in
<br>
the &gt;Bible, does nothing to make your &quot;discrediting by association&quot; argument
<br>
<em>&gt;scientifically valid -- here or ever. 
</em><br>
<p>[re]: Whether or not it meets the test of empirical evidence is the only
<br>
criteria &gt;for its scientific validity. 
<br>
<p>Then what is the basis for your implication that the conclusion is
<br>
scientifically invalid, based as it is entirely on objective empirical evidence
<br>
with all subjective elements excluded? Or is that another case where you are
<br>
shooting from the hip and have not examined the evidence or argument? 
<br>
<p>Skeptics, scientists, and other people would want to rely on science to tell
<br>
them about the world seldom do the relevant research themselves. Instead they
<br>
rely on the findings of researchers whom they trust based on the peer review
<br>
process, the reputations of the journals they publish in, the reputations of the
<br>
academic institutions to which they belong, and the respect given them by their
<br>
own peers in their field. In this case we have had hundreds of geologists,
<br>
geographers, imagery experts, chemists, physicists and others examine the
<br>
thousands of detailed images from the Global Surveyor and Odyssey spacecraft
<br>
orbiting Mars. Many papers have been written on this data involving the geology,
<br>
geologic history, atmosphere, weather, presence of water, CO2, composition of
<br>
the poles, and other features of Mars. 
<br>
<p>Among all these Mars researchers, no one has even hinted that there are
<br>
artificial structures on Mars. If someone spotted something that he thought
<br>
might be artificial structures, merely saying that we have an area here, we
<br>
don't know what it is, it is possibly artificial but we need to do more research
<br>
to determine that and it is yet far too early to reach such a conclusion, would
<br>
create a major news event. Just look at what happened to ALH 84001, the Mars
<br>
meteorite that a researcher examined and found to contain clues that it could be
<br>
harboring fossil life from Mars. The fact of the matter is no one has found the
<br>
slightest hint that there are artificial structures on Mars. Such a finding
<br>
would be one of the most sensational discoveries of all time and it would be
<br>
avidly pursued by hoards of researchers to confirm or falsify it. 
<br>
<p>And you would have us believe that you have found such evidence when people with
<br>
the expertise in these areas haven't. This is very much the same mentality
<br>
you've shown in other areas, especially your claims of finding fundamental
<br>
problems in general relativity that aren't any problems at all to those trained
<br>
in that field. 
<br>
<p>Discussing the merits of the Mars conclusions is far afield of the topic of this
<br>
thread. However, allow me to cite two links that show conclusively that the
<br>
claims are true, not &quot;patently false&quot;. (Has anyone ever obtained a patent to
<br>
protect false claims? :-) 
<br>
<p>(1) <a href="http://essence.utsi.edu/~spsr/">http://essence.utsi.edu/~spsr/</a>, click link to &quot;peer-reviewed journal
<br>
publications&quot;, 7th entry on list: &quot;Evidence for Planetary Artifacts&quot; by six
<br>
authors: Shows that six scientists (out of 30 contributing) from a variety of
<br>
fields supported the conclusions strongly enough to co-author this paper. 
<br>
<p>(2) <a href="http://www.metaresearch.org/solar%20system/cydonia/asom/pressconf_nyc.asp">http://www.metaresearch.org/solar%20system/cydonia/asom/pressconf_nyc.asp</a>
<br>
links to presentation: &quot;Artificial Structures on Mars&quot;, which shows a great deal
<br>
of *evidence* for artificiality on Mars. See the captions in the press release
<br>
for the a priori artificiality tests involved. Valid artificiality judgments are
<br>
never allowed to be subjective, as for &quot;does it look artificial or not?&quot; We
<br>
insisted that only a priori elements be used, such as interrelationships and
<br>
context. 
<br>
<p>The essence of these web sites is that you are doing a pattern recognition
<br>
exercise regardless of whether or not it is justified. And in this case it is
<br>
not. The Global Surveyor image in the Cydonia region of Mars clearly do not show
<br>
a face except to those who want to see a face. It is the classic &quot;Jesus on a
<br>
tortilla&quot; syndrome. If the MGS had been the first spacecraft to image this
<br>
region, I'd venture that no one would be examining it for a face. It is only
<br>
because the first low resolution images from the Viking spacecraft seemed to
<br>
show a face, that anyone is interested in it. 
<br>
<p>You need a lot better evidence than &quot;it looks like a face and it measures like a
<br>
face in some respects.&quot; You'd want to see associated infrastructure used to
<br>
build the face, other structures in the area that are clearly artifacts (and not
<br>
more unjustified pattern recognition exercises on other wind eroded structures),
<br>
and things like changes in the chemical and/or isotope composition of the face
<br>
compared to nearby areas. Without at least one of these things, no one is going
<br>
to take your claim seriously. See
<br>
<a href="http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/25/face2.html">http://www.astrosociety.org/education/publications/tnl/25/face2.html</a> for a good
<br>
review of why professional scientists don't think this is an artificial
<br>
structure. 
<br>
<p>[re]: Such a finding would be sensational and seized upon by those looking for
<br>
any &gt;kind of life in the solar system, let alone intelligent life separate from
<br>
us. &gt;Nobody in the scientific news media has reported that there is even
<br>
disputable &gt;evidence as to whether or not there are artificial structures on
<br>
Mars. If you can &gt;make such an absurd claim, then nothing else you say can be
<br>
believed without &gt;independent verification. 
<br>
<p>You are mistaken on all counts. First, our results were widely reported in the
<br>
second-tier media (NY Post, London Times, talk radio circuit, etc.) 
<br>
<p>But significantly, not the scientific media. Well the general news media reports
<br>
such things as Jesus on a tortilla too. 
<br>
<p>We approached NASA, and they were supportive and ordered more photos be taken to
<br>
confirm or test some of the findings, but refused to alter their official stance
<br>
of &quot;let the photos speak from themselves&quot;, feeling that any official
<br>
pro-artificiality position would be divisive and interpreted by opponents as an
<br>
attempt to boost their budget. 
<br>
<p>I'd bet it would be much more accurate to say that they didn't want to stick
<br>
their neck out to be chopped off without a lot better evidence than yours. They
<br>
did shoot for ancient bacterial life in Mars rocks, but then they actually had
<br>
some evidence for that. 
<br>
<p>They have, however, now ordered a new super-camera with 8-inch resolution on
<br>
board a 2006 Mars spacecraft, hoping for more evidence that might convince even
<br>
the extreme skeptics. 
<br>
<p>I'm sure they didn't approve that instrument just for you. They want to know a
<br>
lot more about Mars in all respects than they do now. But you will benefit all
<br>
the same, and it is good to have your ideas better tested, however groundless
<br>
they seem at the moment. It's something like an experiment to see if there is
<br>
some outside force that governs the burning of tortillas whenever Jesuss' face
<br>
shows up. 
<br>
<p>Mainstream science journals such as Nature and Science refused to send our
<br>
6-author paper out for peer review on the grounds that they are commercial
<br>
publications with reputations to protect, and that such sensational claims must
<br>
be made solely by the authors without borrowing credibility from the journals
<br>
because the controversy would damage the journals, regardless of the merit of
<br>
the topic. 
<br>
<p>They are commercial publications but that is besides the point. They are
<br>
academic publications serving the world-wide academic community. And did they
<br>
tell you this, or is this your own reasoning? 
<br>
<p>(They maintain an ever-growing list of high-profile topics that are
<br>
unconditionally rejected without review regardless of merit because of this
<br>
&quot;need to protect our reputation&quot;.) 
<br>
<p>I'm sure they do. Things like ghost sightings, perpetual motion schemes,
<br>
creationist theories, and Jesus on a tortilla. They won't publish anything for
<br>
which there is little or no empirical evidence for their support. But that
<br>
doesn't mean that they won't publish controversial findings or even claims that
<br>
most would consider quackery. They've published Hoyle and Narlikar's
<br>
quasi-steady state theory at a time when the evidence was already strongly in
<br>
favor of the Big Bang, a &quot;successful&quot; test of the effectiveness of homeopathy,
<br>
and the claim that controlled burns do not reduce the fire hazard in forests. 
<br>
<p>Finally, a few mainstream media reps who attended the press conference (ABC News
<br>
was one example) covered the story and scheduled it for air time. But execs at
<br>
the highest levels canceled the scheduled coverage for unstated reasons,
<br>
undoubtedly similar to those for the journals. 
<br>
<p>A rare moment of sanity in the main media. Amazing. 
<br>
<p>One big-name news anchor mentioned to me, somewhat by way of apology, that he
<br>
was now sitting on top of dozens of secrets too hot for the execs to put on the
<br>
air. 
<br>
<p>Meaning what? Your information was too secret to broadcast? 
<br>
<p>In short, your simplistic speculation about motives does not reflect the real
<br>
world. 
<br>
<p>I think I've got a lot better handle on it than you do. 
<br>
<p>Despite about 50 reviews by qualified parties and hundreds of suggestions, no
<br>
fault was found with our technical paper. But those of us willing to associate
<br>
our names with this finding were asked to &quot;fall on our swords&quot; so as to make
<br>
this controversial conclusion safer for those who follow. Yet people such as
<br>
yourself come along and use this as evidence that we are all incompetent
<br>
swordsmen because we stabbed ourselves. That was not how it happened! 
<br>
<p>I think at this point it is appropriate to introduce John Baez's crackpot index.
<br>
It is on his web site at <a href="http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html">http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/crackpot.html</a> (but I took
<br>
this copy from <a href="http://www.magna.com.au/~prfbrown/news95_e.html">http://www.magna.com.au/~prfbrown/news95_e.html</a> because of better
<br>
formatting for copying.) 
<br>
<p>The Crackpot Index A simple method for rating potentially revolutionary
<br>
contributions to physics. 
<br>
<p><p>1) A -5 point starting credit. 
<br>
2) 1 point for every statement that is widely agreed on to be false. 
<br>
3) 2 points for every statement that is clearly vacuous. 
<br>
4) 3 points for every statement that is logically inconsistent. 
<br>
5) 5 points for each such statement that is adhered to despite careful
<br>
correction. 
<br>
6) 5 points for using a thought experiment that contradicts the results of a
<br>
widely accepted real experiment. 
<br>
7) 5 points for each word in all capital letters (except for those with
<br>
defective keyboards). 
<br>
8) 10 points for each claim that quantum mechanics is fundamentally misguided
<br>
(without good evidence). 
<br>
9) 10 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Einstein, or claim that
<br>
special or general relativity are fundamentally misguided (without good
<br>
evidence). 
<br>
10) 10 points for pointing out that one has gone to school, as if this were
<br>
evidence of sanity. 
<br>
11) 20 points for suggesting that you deserve a Nobel prize. 
<br>
12) 20 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Newton or claim that
<br>
classical mechanics is fundamentally misguided (without evidence). 
<br>
13) 20 points for every use of science fiction works or myths as if they were
<br>
fact. 
<br>
14) 20 points for defending yourself by bringing up (real or imagined) ridicule
<br>
accorded to ones past theories. 
<br>
15) 30 points for each favorable comparison of oneself to Galileo, claims that
<br>
the Inquisition is hard at work on ones case, etc.. 
<br>
16) 30 points for claiming that when ones theory is finally appreciated,
<br>
present-day science will be seen as the sham it truly is. 
<br>
17) 30 points for claiming that the &quot;scientific establishment&quot; is engaged in a
<br>
&quot;conspiracy&quot; to prevent ones work from gaining its well-deserved fame, or
<br>
suchlike. 
<br>
18) 40 points for claiming one has a revolutionary theory but giving no concrete
<br>
testable predictions.

<p>John Baez E-Mail: <a href="mailto:baez@guitar.ucr.edu?Subject=Re:%20FWD%20(SK)%20Re:%20The%20bottom%20two-thirds%20of%20a%20cosmological%20iceberg%20?">baez@guitar.ucr.edu</a> (john baez) 
<br>
----------------------------------------------------------
<br>
<p>You've already scored on several categories in your past posts. It is the reason
<br>
I categorize you as a crank. Your above complaint comes under #17. 
<br>
<p>[re]: You clearly expect your &quot;problems&quot; to falsify the Big Bang. 
<br>
<p>True. But not all 30 arguments are strong enough to falsify it all by
<br>
themselves, which is what you implied for the matter/antimatter asymmetry
<br>
argument. 
<br>
<p>[tvf]: The matter/antimatter asymmetry remains a real problem for BB, and also
<br>
<em>&gt;awaits yet another ad hoc helper hypothesis to save the model. Now that we know &gt;that even the expansion of the universe is in doubt because redshift does not &gt;necessarily require velocity as an explanation [ref1], and that better explanations &gt;exist for the black body microwave radiation than a BB fireball remnant [ref2], the &gt;BB that remains is nothing but a collection of flexible auxiliary hypotheses, with &gt;no kernel to hold them together. 
</em><br>
<p>[re]: In light of today's knowledge, this statement is absurd. Strong empirical
<br>
<em>&gt;verification of the Big Bang include the ratios of the light elements and their &gt;isotopes ... verification of Hubble recessional redshifts from time dilation ... &gt;higher temperatures in the microwave background radiation (CMB) in the early &gt;universe ... the one degree peak in the anisotropy spectrum of the CMB ... the &gt;partial polarization of the CMB. No other alternative theory has any hope of &gt;duplicating these characteristics of the CMB. The Big Bang is now verified well &gt;beyond a reasonable doubt. 
</em><br>
<p>These are the subjects of some several of the other points on the BB problems
<br>
list. Discussing them in depth would considerably broaden this exchange, and
<br>
require you to read the paper first. You can do that now, or you can wait until
<br>
it comes out in print in a year or so. At the moment, the paper is circulating
<br>
privately and collecting co-authors who support it and have ideas to add to it.
<br>
Before it is submitted, we expect to have several major names and institutions
<br>
involved. 
<br>
<p>Since the BB is now confirmed well beyond a reasonable doubt, this will be like
<br>
your relativity paper. A pitiful attempt to knock down verified theory. 
<br>
<p>[re]: From the web site: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Despite the widespread acceptance of the big bang theory as a working model for
<br>
interpreting new findings, not a single important prediction of the theory has
<br>
yet been confirmed, and substantial evidence has accumulated against it.&quot; 
<br>
<p>To put it bluntly, this is a lie. 
<br>
<p>This shows clearly that further discussion with you is pointless. You admit that
<br>
you have not read the paper supporting the previous statement. Yet without
<br>
examining the reasoning or citations, you declare it a lie, not just a mistake. 
<br>
<p>A deliberate intentional mistake is a lie. &quot;Not a single important prediction of
<br>
the theory has yet been confirmed&quot; is blatantly false, therefore a lie. 
<br>
<p>This hints at an almost religious desperation to sustain your present belief,
<br>
instead of the dispassionate objectivity that science demands. Any good evidence
<br>
paper shows a protocol and testing that raise the conclusion above being
<br>
influenced by the biases of the experimenters/authors. Without such controls, we
<br>
all just confirm our own biases in whatever we do. The alternative you seem to
<br>
prefer is a life in which one never rises above the errors one has accepted
<br>
along the way. 
<br>
<p>Nice words from someone who violates the scientific method at almost every step.
<br>
The paper on your web site with the wording &quot;not a single important prediction
<br>
of the theory has yet been confirmed&quot; is blatantly biased by picking out tests
<br>
that are old and of marginal value, while totally ignoring the strongest
<br>
evidence for expansion. That isn't doing science, that's fulfilling an agenda. 
<br>
<p>I recommend you study Scientific Method, why it works, and why any theory that
<br>
has abandoned controls on testing should be regarded with the utmost suspicion. 
<br>
<p>Take your own advice. Cherry picking data is the mark of a pseudoscientist and
<br>
is commonly found among cranks. 
<br>
<p><p>[tvf]: One of the better cases for that at the moment is the B/Be ratio [Science
<br>
<em>&gt;290, 1257 (2000)]. 
</em><br>
<p>[re]: Another wrong citation. 
<br>
<p>It cannot be &quot;another&quot; unless there was a previous case. But I concede, I got
<br>
the page number wrong for this one. Point for you. Here's the correct reference
<br>
and a summary of its contents: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Science 290, &quot;Editor's Choice&quot; 11/17 issue (2000); astro-ph/0009482; Astron.
<br>
Astrophys., in press. H, He, Li are thought to have been formed in the Big Bang.
<br>
Be and B are thought to be secondary elements from supernovae through
<br>
spallation. However, the Be abundance in one metal poor star is greater than
<br>
spallation allows. As a result, a new mechanism may be needed for BB
<br>
nucleosynthesis.&quot; 
<br>
<p>[re]: If there is some article or paper somewhere about the B/Be ratio, it is
<br>
<em>&gt;irrelevant to the BB since beryllium is generated by galactic cosmic ray &gt;spallation. The amount is not primordial and the amount in a star is a mixture of &gt;primordial and cosmic ray generated Be. We can't tell anything about the nuclear &gt;synthesis era or the age of the universe by measuring Be. Likewise for boron. 
</em><br>
<p>The news note about this paper in Science says otherwise. 
<br>
<p>And the suggestions in the paper at astro-ph/0009482 say otherwise. The authors
<br>
mention several possibilities that don't involve BB nucleosynthesis. The full
<br>
URL is <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0009/0009482.pdf">http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/astro-ph/pdf/0009/0009482.pdf</a>. 
<br>
<p>[re]: [Astrophys.J. 393, 59-67 (1992)] It's an old trick of cranks to use
<br>
obsolete &gt;data to support their claims. 
<br>
<p>[tvf]: Nice. Now you include name-calling in your repertoire. 
<br>
<p>[re]: You have amply demonstrated that you are a crank. 
<br>
<p>And you have amply demonstrated a lack of objectivity on the subject and of
<br>
willingness to discuss the merits by constantly trying to switch the subject to
<br>
a mud-slinging contest. As those who study Scientific Method know, this is a
<br>
frequent tactic of those who feel they are losing on the merits. 
<br>
<p>We have been debating the merits of your claims and are continuing to do so. We
<br>
skeptics decide if someone is a crank based on those merits and once a person is
<br>
so qualified we don't shy away from labeling a spade a spade. You have scored
<br>
points in many categories in John Baez's crackpot index with your infantile
<br>
understanding of the Big Bang (such as ascribing problems to the BB that have
<br>
nothing to do with the BB) and relativity (deciding something is a problem
<br>
because you take a Newtonian view instead of a relativistic view, and then
<br>
inventing absurd theory to solve the supposed problem), the claim of artifacts
<br>
on Mars with essentially nothing more than the imagination to support it, and
<br>
statements like the authors of the relativity sites I've provided have axes to
<br>
grind. 
<br>
<p>Note that the chief evidence you cite to back a claim that I am a crank is that
<br>
I hold positions on a few intellectual issues different from yours and the
<br>
mainstream's. I know everyone in every belief system wishes to label every
<br>
outsider as a crank. But nothing could be more anti-intellectual or
<br>
self-serving. 
<br>
<p>As above. You lack a fundamental understanding of the theories you are
<br>
challenging, you think mainstream scientists have axes to grind, and you
<br>
complain that your attempts to publish are being suppressed. 
<br>
<p>You see, Tom, a person who isn't a crank would start out by assuming that
<br>
mainstream scientists know what they are talking about, and then would make a
<br>
serious effort to properly learn the theory they want to challenge, especially
<br>
concerning the explanation for the problem they think they've found. They would
<br>
also look at all the observations and tests that support the theory, and those
<br>
that don't, if any, and take all of it into account, not cherry pick them. Once
<br>
they thought that they had a reasonably good understanding of the theory and
<br>
conditions, they would then try to discuss it with a trained theorist or
<br>
researcher, perhaps in a forum such as sci.astro.research or
<br>
sci.physics.research, two moderated Usenet groups devoted to discussing such
<br>
things that have a number of qualified people on hand to answer questions. A
<br>
person who really desires to get at the truth of things will not decide that
<br>
mainstream scientists have axes to grind and then invent their own theories that
<br>
they think better explain phenomena than already verified theories. 
<br>
<p>[re]: [quantized redshifts] The data set on the newer study was much larger than
<br>
<em>&gt;the older study. The older study apparently had selection bias effects. By using a &gt;far larger data set, this has been eliminated. 
</em><br>
<p>But pencil beam surveys show that redshift is certainly quantized on a much
<br>
larger scale, and that result is now widely accepted as valid, and interpreted
<br>
to mean that galaxies occur in alternating walls and voids. 
<br>
<p>I don't know of pencil beam studies that show quantization. But some periodicity
<br>
will be seen because large scale surveys show that galactic groups are arranged
<br>
in soap bubble like structures with sheets, walls and voids. 
<br>
<p>However, this now-recognized quantization effect also disappears in broader
<br>
surveys for reasons not yet understood, but indicative of something important
<br>
about either the nature of redshift or of large-scale structure. It therefore is
<br>
unsurprising that the smaller-scale quantization might have the same difference
<br>
in behavior ­ a dependence on the survey area covered. 
<br>
<p>A pencil beam study might look further than a broad study, but you are still
<br>
dealing with small numbers of galaxies. So it is much more subject to selection
<br>
effects than broader studies. Besides which, with the newer 2dF and Sloan
<br>
Digital Sky surveys, the databases to mine are enormous and they look pretty far
<br>
out. Pencil beams don't reach all that much further. 
<br>
<p>[tvf]: The second reference is in my hand as I write this, and is correct as to
<br>
<em>&gt;journal, volume, page numbers, and year. So your claim that you physically checked &gt;the journal is shown to be a bluff. 
</em><br>
<p>[re]: It is no bluff. I walked into the UC Riverside Science Library and went to
<br>
<em>&gt;the journal stacks and examined the journal. I looked at issues at the year of the &gt;reference and several others, including earlier ones and later ones and the latest &gt;ones. Anyone reading these posts can do the same. 
</em><br>
<p>Shall we make this a credibility challenge, then? The citation in question is:
<br>
Astronomical Journal, v. 121, pp. 21-30 (2001), paper by Burbidge et al. on
<br>
quantization effects in redshifts. Lets ask for a volunteer third party --
<br>
anyone willing can do it -- to verify that the citation is correct (as I say) or
<br>
wrong (as you say). 
<br>
<p>Ah. Now I know what happened. You said Astron.J. 121, 21-30 (2001). I took that
<br>
to mean Astronomy and Astrophysics. I was looking at the wrong journal. It is
<br>
better not to use abbreviations unless you are sure that the other person knows
<br>
what it means. When I use a citation, I always copy and paste the full title and
<br>
info out of the computer database. 
<br>
<p>Now I have looked up Burbidge's article. The sample size of 57 galactic
<br>
redshifts and 39 quasars is too small to be meaningful. 
<br>
<p>[re]: There is no authority in science in the sense of some person decides what
<br>
is &gt;true and that's that, but we can have some confidence in what the consensus
<br>
of &gt;researchers in a field may conclude about some issue - as much confidence as
<br>
they &gt;themselves have. 
<br>
<p>But essentially every mainstream theory is a consensus of experts until it is
<br>
overthrown. One can learn nothing from the number of experts or their degree of
<br>
confidence. Here are some quotes that seem relevant to this point: 
<br>
<p>** &quot;I would sooner believe that two Yankee professors lied, than that stones
<br>
fell from the sky.&quot; - Thomas Jefferson (1806), on hearing reports of meteorites. 
<br>
<p>** &quot;An expert is a man who never makes small mistakes.&quot; -- Tom Phipps, Heretical
<br>
Verities 
<br>
<p>** “Cosmologists are often in error, but never in doubt.” ­ Lev Landau 
<br>
<p>“I am certain that it is time to retire Landau’s quote.” ­ Cosmologist Michael
<br>
Turner (Phys.Today Dec., 10-11 (2001). 
<br>
<p>A consensus of experts - here meaning researchers in the field - can certainly
<br>
be wrong. But they aren't going to be wrong all that often and there had better
<br>
be good grounds for assuming they are. Some areas of research are better settled
<br>
than others. Some, say the causation of earthquakes or Alzheimer's disease, are
<br>
so poorly known that there isn't a consensus at all. But others are so strongly
<br>
confirmed that few if any hold contrary opinions. Evolution, relativity and
<br>
quantum mechanics fall under that state. 
<br>
<p>[re]: I see from the library database that [Vigier] has published only in
<br>
<em>&gt;Foundations of Physics Letters with one exception. That is a flag that he is as &gt;untrained in general relativity and quantum mechanics as you are. 
</em><br>
<p>It is amazing how ignorant one can remain if one tries hard enough. Vigier is
<br>
one of the most widely published and celebrated physicists, specializing in
<br>
quantum physics, of our times. Why don't you use your celebrated &quot;library
<br>
database&quot; on my name and see what it turns up, then compare with my Bibliography
<br>
at the link I gave in my last message? I'll bet you find only a small percentage
<br>
of my publications there, as you obviously did for Vigier. 
<br>
<p>You're missing the point - a very important one. What counts in the community of
<br>
science is the publications in academic journals and what particular field of a
<br>
science. A computer scientist who has lots of publications in computer journals
<br>
can claim that evolution is false, but he can't get his &quot;theories&quot; published in
<br>
any biology journal. At best he might make something like the ICR's Acts and
<br>
Facts. So no biologist takes him seriously, and a few who may have the curiosity
<br>
to look at his claims finds he has fundamental misunderstandings about
<br>
evolutionary theory. 
<br>
<p>I found 43 publications of yours in various journals. I don't see any in
<br>
journals specializing in relativity. There is only one co-authored with Arp
<br>
where you challenge the Big Bang. It is: 
<br>
<p>The case against the big bang. Source PHYSICS LETTERS SECTION A GENERAL ATOMIC
<br>
AND SOLID STATE PHYSICS [0375-9601] yr: 1992 vol: 164 iss: 4 pg: 263. 
<br>
<p>In cosmology terms 1992 is pretty old. And a journal specializing in general
<br>
atomic and solid state physics? You see, you haven't been able to publish your
<br>
ideas on the Big Bang in something like the Astrophysical Journal, where it
<br>
would properly belong if people took it seriously. 
<br>
<p>As for Vigier, his &quot;double first name&quot; fouled up my initial computer database
<br>
search. I've done a more comprehensive search now and see 186 publications, the
<br>
majority as a co-author in a group. It looks like only two or three are
<br>
publications in relativity journals, and again it is with co-authors and on
<br>
stuff not basic to general relativity. The fact of the matter is I read your
<br>
paper co-authored with him. I assume everything stated in it the both of you
<br>
agree with. So I can state with confidence that you both demonstrate abysmal
<br>
ignorance of general relativity. 
<br>
<p>[re]: Then let [the editor of Foundations of Physics] be insulted. Because he's
<br>
<em>&gt;approved your and Vigier's paper which is full of absurd claims that would be &gt;laughed at by the editors of any mainstream journal. 
</em><br>
<p>Your religious fervor for what you believe knows no bounds, does it? 
<br>
<p>You don't know the difference
