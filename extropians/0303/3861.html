<em>&gt;&gt; It sounds like such a great idea, any reasons anyone can present why
</em><br>
I shouldn't think it one?
<br>
<p>People already addicted to food would be encouraged to increase
<br>
consumption further.  Thus exacerbating the food shortage which exists
<br>
in many parts of the world.  
<br>
<p>Burning more calories also does nothing to encourage cardiovascular
<br>
health.  The heart is a muscle and like any other muscle it stays in
<br>
tone by the training effect achieved by exercise.  Too much cholesterol
<br>
or homocysteine in your system and you still may have plugged arteries.
<br>
You may look skinny but still die of a heart attack or stroke.  
<br>
<p>I guess what I'm saying is the benefits of good diet and exercise still
<br>
has many health benefits that outweigh just having a high metabolism.
<br>
<p>If people could stay skinny without eating right or exercising the net
<br>
effect might be more people dieing prematurely!

<br>
<p>&quot;I think most talk about obesity here is taking a decidedly un-Extropian
<br>
point of view...I have no interest at all in being a an emaciated
<br>
exercise-obsessed 120-year-old human; I want to be a 1000-year-old sexy
<br>
glutton.&quot;
<br>
<p>I am in total agreement, instead of using our mass of accumulated
<br>
knowledge and our extropian brains to come up with new laws,
<br>
regulations, and restrictions, lets give the individual something that
<br>
they will want that will make them healthier and live longer, and solve
<br>
the post-industrialized worlds obesity 'problem'.  Hence my support of
<br>
the device I outlined in my recent post.  
<br>
<p>I want to be a healthy fit attractive 1,000 year old glutton as well.  A
<br>
small calorie burning implant would enable just that, it would not have
<br>
the free-radical conducive damage that cellular combustion does, and
<br>
could be used to power other implants and devices.  Need to get 20
<br>
blocks to the other side of town or stroll the through park, have a
<br>
piece of cheese cake that'll power the small wheels on your shoe for a
<br>
week.  
<br>
<p>I can think of nothing negative of such a device, society all-ready
<br>
accepts implants for aesthetic purposes, this would have a functional
<br>
and healthy purpose.  Though it would put the current trial lawyers
<br>
targeting 'big food' out of work, and surely technophobic greens and
<br>
luddites would oppose it.  
<br>
<p>It sounds like such a great idea, any reasons anyone can present why I
<br>
shouldn't think it one?
