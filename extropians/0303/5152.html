</em><br>
Yes.  Not that I expect people to be consistent.  As the most obtrusive
<br>
figure the US can expect to gain the most scrutiny.  By and large we've
<br>
done pretty well, especially in a historical context, but I don't expect

people to notice that.

civilian
<br>

yet,
<br>
<em>&gt;unlike our adversaries in Baghdad or Hanoi, mass terror is not our policy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I didn't ignore it, but despite any care that may have been taken,
<br>
people are being maimed, killed, wounded, and having their water
<br>
supplies destroyed.  You can argue all you want that it could have been
<br>
much worse, but ensuring a large number of survivors who have been
<br>
grossly damaged by you is going to make you LOTS of enemies.
<br>
<p>N.B.:  survivors.  We are injuring people, and insuring that they, or
<br>
their relatives, survive.  People that you kill aren't going to hurt
<br>
you.  People who aren't involved may be disgusted, frightened, etc., but
<br>
they won't feel vengeful.  People whose children you kill are going to
<br>
hate you bitterly.   I consider this war to be immoral from the start,
<br>
but I also consider that it's being conducted in a way that is almost
<br>
designed to create a large number of bitter enemies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Are you going to seriously argue that the Iraqi people will not benefit
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the removal of Saddam Hussein?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;If that were the only effect, then I wouldn't make that assertion.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt;actually I expect that to be a minor benefit that they may obtain, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the puppet we put in isn't even worse.  (Remember, we put him in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;originally.)&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, we did not &quot;put him in originally.&quot; We certainly did aid his regime in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;his war against the Iranians. But so what? That fact alone does not look at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that decision in any historical perspective nor does it prohibit us from
</em><br>
our
<br>
<em>&gt;current action. We heavily aided the Soviet Union during World War II, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;temporary alliance that gave way to inevitable conflict when our common
</em><br>
enemy
<br>
<em>&gt;had been vanquished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I think you are wrong about that, though I'll need to check.  (I had
<br>
been told that he worked for/with the CIA, and extrapolated from that,
<br>
perhaps incorrectly.)  If we didn't put him in, then we have even less
<br>
moral standing in removing him... so from my point of view, you are
<br>
saying that I've been giving the US too much credit for moral
<br>
justification for this war.
<br>
<p>No, I believe he is saying that your assumptions are not true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;They are doing it intentionally in the sense that they are criminally
</em><br>
<em>&gt;negligent if they didn't know ahead of time that this would happen.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not claiming that they planned to do it, but rather that they had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;know that this would be one of the effects.  &quot;Collateral damage&quot; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;believe the term is.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You claim we are &quot;criminally negligent&quot; for causing a limited number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;civilian deaths. What is Saddam Hussein then? It is absolutely ludicrous to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
No.  I believe that they did know that they would be causing many deaths
<br>
in non-combatants, and in people who just objected to their homeland
<br>
being invaded by a foreign power.  I don't feel that they acted in
<br>
ignorance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;suggest that the amount of civilian casualties will approach any where near
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the number of Iraqi deaths Hussein's regime is responsible for. It is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It makes a big difference who is doing the vile things.  If we are doing
<br>
it, then it is our responsibility.  If we are supporting their bein
<br>
done, then it is partially our responsibility.  If we aren't doing them,
<br>
then it isn't our responsibility.
<br>
<p>You omit the next possible logical scenerio, we sit by and allow it to
<br>
happen.  Is that moral?
<br>
<p>&quot;We might reasonably assist someone requesting our aid.&quot;
<br>
<p>And if they are unable to request it because they will be beaten, raped,
<br>
gased, tortured, or executed?  Plenty of exiles have requested our
<br>
assistance.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In this case I think it would be justified to place
<br>
a price on Hussein's head (a fairly large one).  But this is because I
<br>
feel that we are already involved (I still haven't check on your earlier
<br>
assertion).  If we weren't involved, then I don't feel we would even
<br>
have the moral right to go that far.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;logical to assume that the number of those butchered by that regime will
</em><br>
only
<br>
<em>&gt;continue to grow. The UN has done nothing to abate this situation. They did
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing to stop genocide in Cambodia, Laos, Ethopia, the Soviet Union,
</em><br>
China,
<br>
<em>&gt;Rwanda, and a ton of other locales in the world. Are you suggesting that
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;limited number of 1000-6000 (the estimates in Afghanistan) is worse than
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt;continued mass murder that will be inflicted on the Iraqis by Hussein and
</em><br>
his
<br>
<em>&gt;heirs apparent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
There are many massacres occuring in the world.  Are you suggesting that
<br>
we should invade and destroy whereever they might be about to occur, or
<br>
have recently occured?  Seriously?  And you are considering that this is
<br>
not only moral, but demanded by morality?
<br>
<p>Yes, to think that if we have a reasonable cause to suspect a mass murder,
<br>
genocide, democide, or similar event is about to occur and that we should do
<br>
nothing about it is absolutely immoral.  If you were to watch your neighbor
<br>
get beaten and butchered while you were cleaning your handgun, would you
<br>
consider it moral to sit idly by?  I dont know what strange convention of
<br>
morality you abide that that *requires* you to do nothing to help others
<br>
when you are perfectly capable of helping them.
<br>
<p>Why draw a distinction when 'states' are involved.  Especially when one
<br>
state is a representation of its people and embraces freedom and individual
<br>
rights, while the other is headed by a murderous tyrannical dictator.  Such
<br>
a state is not a valid or moral state in the *first* place, Saddam has no
<br>
*right* to rule Iraq as he does not respect the rights of his own people.
<br>
<p><p>I'm sorry, but that's not the way my morality points.  At the most, the
<br>
absolute most, we could announce, and then follow through with, a policy
<br>
of placing a price on the heads of state whenever some group (who?) had
<br>
reached a conclusion that the head of that state had been guilty of mass
<br>
murder.  (It had better be a fairly large number, or the ex-governor of
<br>
Texas might find himself on the list.)
<br>
<p>Mind you, I still have questions about the morality of that.  Perhaps it
<br>
should be limited the the heads of state secret police and allied
<br>
agencies rather than the head of state himself.  And even so, I'm not
<br>
sure about the justification used for intervening were we weren't
<br>
previously involved.  The slim thread of morality is that we wouldn't be
<br>
encouraging the killing of anyone who wasn't already responsible for
<br>
murder.  But that's pretty slim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;And please correct me if I'm wrong Charles, but if you accept that Hussein
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;is (or was) evil&quot; then you must then accept the conservative estimates
</em><br>
that
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;he is responsible for the deaths of at least 200,000 of his own people. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;I don't have any basis to accept or reject any particular set of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;numbers.  But there's a big difference between his doing it and our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;doing it.  If he does it, then he is the villian.  If we do it, then we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The end result will be a better quality of life for the Iraqis with a
</em><br>
better
<br>
<em>&gt;government. Are you going to offer that the Taliban or the Soviet proxies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were better for Afghanistan than Hamid Karzai's regime?
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;And the USSR suppressed ethnic rivalries that have resulted
<br>
in massive bloodshed, so one could easily argue that they often made
<br>
things better.  Both nations generally act in their own perceived self
<br>
interest, and justify it with fancy speeches.  The US hasn't wanted
<br>
undefensible territories far from it's borders, but it's been quite
<br>
eager for various minerals.  The USSR plundered western europe of it's
<br>
industrial capability when it didn't have it's own (for a combination of
<br>
reasons).  Neither action seems particularly moral to me, but both have
<br>
generally made moralistic justifications.  And they US supports corrupt
<br>
and abusive dictators all over the world, as long as we find them
<br>
beneficial.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;...That being said, in the long run, more lives will be saved through our
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;war
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of aggression&quot; than by allowing Saddam Hussein to remain in power. Not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;This may or may not be true.  It remains to be proven.  Sometimes we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have replaced one vile madman with another, sometimes we have improved

<em>&gt;things, sometimes we have made them worse.  Usually on close examination
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it turns out that we acted in what we saw as our own self-interest, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any moralistic hand-wringing was just that.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I have never on this forum ever said that we have acted in anything beyond
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our own self-interest internationally. I have made a point of illustrating
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is not a bad thing. However, there is a huge difference between the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-interest of the United States and, for example, the totalitarians of

the

has
<br>
<em>&gt;a better history of spreading the causes of democracy and freedom abroad
</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt;the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;mention the fact that the quality of life of the people of Iraq will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;improved, just as &quot;amazingly&quot; happens almost every time the United States
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;intervenes abroad. I think we all recall the South Koreans, Greeks,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Japanese,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;West Germans, and Afghans, among others, no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;MacArthur and Marshall were extraordinary generals.  And Hitler was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;kind of villian that Hussein only has wet dreams about.  And we occupied
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Japan for twenty years.  But I can also recall many other events that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turned out much worse.  The Dominican Republic comes to mind as an
</em><br>
example.&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Again, you may criticize the United States all you like. As a matter of
</em><br>
fact,
<br>
<em>&gt;I recommend it in regard to the policies of the Johnson administration.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;However, the Trujillo regime that was in power in the Dominican Republic
</em><br>
from
<br>
<em>&gt;the 1930's through the 60's was certainly worse than what came after it.
</em><br>
And
<br>
<em>&gt;more to the point, it is absolutely ludicrous to suggest that democracy
</em><br>
would
<br>
<em>&gt;be in Germany, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan, Greece, among a score of other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;countries without direct actions taken by the United States. Please
</em><br>
<em>&gt;illustrate to me what other nations can make this claim?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Germany had a democracy before WWII, and would probably have returned to
<br>
one as a choice after defeat, though our intervention probably hastened
<br>
things.  Japan's democrary is still largely a matter of form (the same
<br>
ruling party has been in power since the start, if I'm remembering
<br>
things correctly).  It may become more democratic with time, or at least
<br>
adopt the &quot;two identical partys&quot; system that we use.  I'm not really
<br>
very familiar with South Korea, but I seem to recall that it was
<br>
basically run by a strong-man... still that was decades ago, and I
<br>
haven't paid much attention recently.  Taiwan has been under the
<br>
domination of the Nationalist Party since it took the island, but since
<br>
their founding strong-man (sorry, I forget his name-- I keep wanting to
<br>
say Ho Chi Minh or Sun Yat-Sen) died they have been less internally
<br>
autocratic.  But I understand that the original inhabitants still have
<br>
essentially no rights.  Greece has been a Kindom, a Democracy, a
<br>
WarLordShip??, and I guess it may be back to being a democracy again.
<br>
Again I don't know the details, but I'm guessing that their central
<br>
government, whatever it's form, is relatively weak (a good thing from my
<br>
point of view).  And the US supported all of the variants.  The US
<br>
doesn't really support democracies, though it tends to like oligarcies,
<br>
and finds it convenient if they pretend to be democracies...  sometimes
<br>
the pretense will drift into an actuality.  This may be happening in
<br>
Mexico.  But it isn't a short process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So, without commenting further, note the ease with which you criticize Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and not Saddam Hussein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Bush claims to represent me.
