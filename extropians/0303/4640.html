Geron Corporation Reports Publication of Research Supporting the Utility of
<br>
Telomerase as a Universal Antigen for Cancer Immunotherapy
<br>
<p>&nbsp;March 18, 2003; Menlo Park, CA (Business Wire) --- Geron Corp. (Nasdaq:
<br>
GERN) announced today the publication of research results that support the
<br>
utility of telomerase for widespread applications in cancer immunotherapy.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;The research, published in the March 2003 issue of Cancer Gene Therapy,
<br>
shows that different types of cancer cells, including cancer cells without
<br>
any known tumor-associated antigens, can be killed by telomerase-based
<br>
immunotherapy. Geron scientists studied Melanoma and Colon Cancer cell
<br>
lines that are known to express the tumor-associated antigens, MART-1 and
<br>
CEA-1, respectively, and an Osteosarcoma line lacking any known tumor
<br>
antigen. Telomerase was introduced into human dendritic cells by gene
<br>
transfer enabling the dendritic cells to generate telomerase-specific
<br>
cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) that killed all three tumor cell lines.
<br>
These findings show that telomerase vaccination can be used in all cancer
<br>
patients, even those with tumors that do not express any known
<br>
tumor-associated antigens.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Telomerase is activated in all human cancer types, including breast, lung,
<br>
colon, prostate, pancreatic, and hematologic tumors. Telomerase is
<br>
therefore an attractive candidate for use as a universal therapeutic cancer
<br>
vaccine. A Phase 1 study of Geron's ex-vivo telomerase vaccine is currently
<br>
underway in patients with metastatic prostate cancer at Duke University
<br>
Medical Center.
<br>
<p>Study Results
<br>
<p>&nbsp;In the study, Geron scientists were able to show that dendritic cells (the
<br>
most potent antigen presenting cells in the body) obtained from the
<br>
peripheral blood of normal healthy volunteers can be modified in vitro with
<br>
purified human telomerase DNA or with an adenoviral vector containing human
<br>
telomerase DNA. The resulting telomerase-modified dendritic cells then
<br>
present antigenic fragments of the telomerase protein to T-lymphocytes,
<br>
thereby enabling them to recognize and kill telomerase-positive cancer
<br>
cells. This study shows that dendritic cells genetically modified with the
<br>
telomerase gene can be used to generate an immune response against cancer
<br>
cells, and extends previous work that showed similar results using
<br>
telomerase RNA (Nature Medicine 2000;6:1011-1017) or telomerase peptides
<br>
(Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 2000; 25:4796-4801) as antigens. These results
<br>
support the potential use of telomerase as a universal cancer vaccine
<br>
administered directly to cancer patients in order to induce a strong and
<br>
specific anti-telomerase immune response in which the patients' own
<br>
lymphocytes recognize and kill telomerase-expressing cancer cells.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;The universal expression of telomerase in cancer cells forms the
<br>
rationale for our ongoing programs in telomerase inhibition (GRN163),
<br>
telomerase oncolytic viruses (partnered with Genetic Therapy,
<br>
Inc/Novartis), and telomerase immunotherapy, currently in Phase 1 Clinical
<br>
Trials at Duke,&quot; said David B. Karpf, Geron's Executive Medical Director of
<br>
Oncology. &quot;This study provides additional support for the use of telomerase
<br>
in cancer vaccine trials, and suggests that telomerase-based immunotherapy
<br>
may be useful for all cancer patients regardless of the tumor antigen
<br>
status of their cancer cells.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Physicians or patients who would like more information on the Duke
<br>
telomerase vaccine trial may contact the clinical trials coordinator at
