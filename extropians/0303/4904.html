<p><em>&gt; [M]any posters have made a strong case that there was never

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I have not seen any such cases, those posted seem to be based 
<br>
on a misunderstanding of what international law is. 
<br>
<p>Agreements embodied in treaties and in the UN Charter are
<br>
referred to as international law. 
<br>
<p>5 people washed up on a desert island or marooned in space could
<br>
define a set of laws to live by if they so choose. It could be that the
<br>
only enforcement on these might be reputations as well. 
<br>
<p>But laws, including international laws, that are breached, are still 
<br>
laws.
<br>
<p>Under the UN Charter the enforceability of UN resolutions falls
<br>
to the security council. The Security Council in turn derives its law
<br>
enforcing power from the mutual obligations that the permanent
<br>
security council members signed on to when the signed the UN 
<br>
Charter.
<br>
<p>If any of them exercise bad faith in relation to the agreed obligations
<br>
then the law may not be *enforced* but it is still the law and there
<br>
are still consequences in breaking agreed laws even if these are 
<br>
only consequences for reputations. No existing security council 
<br>
member is claiming that international law does not exist. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm still sad, though.  It seems like a tender shoot was trod into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dirt before it could become a tree, even if it wasn't a tree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already.  International law wouldn't have arisen from nowhere. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would have to be built, step by step. 
</em><br>
<p>International law can be built in large increments by treaties 
<br>
(contracts) being signed by the heads of state of nations but the
<br>
difficult bit is to get confidence built into the structure. The whole 
<br>
construct that is the current UN Charter came into being (largely)
<br>
in one move when the Charter was ratified. 
<br>
<p>Its hard to see how this confidence could arise with President Bush
<br>
still in the Presidency. Too much of the world doesn't trust him.
<br>
