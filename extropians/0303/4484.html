<p><em>&gt; [Lee wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Recently, I have listed as the *top* priority of executives in modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; democracies the object of getting re-elected.  Though true, (and I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wondering if I have been too cynical), it's also very likely that the highly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; partisan individuals who succeed to high office deeply believe that almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the worst  thing that could befall their nation would be to let the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; political opposition start running things!
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Since the topic here is Nixon, and Lee proposes to Judge one's action by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their motivations,
</em><br>
<p>I never said that, and I'm sorry if people would infer
<br>
that from my remarks.  We must almost always judge by
<br>
results (or actions), just as is done in law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and not on the actions themselves, and then further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggests that executives in modern democracies focus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; solely on getting re-elected, I thought it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prudent to post this.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For those following this thread and following Lee's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments, read through this speech of Nixon and see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you feel his primary motivation is indeed to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-elected.
</em><br>
<p>Matus has excerpted the following from Nixon's speech
<br>
that Michael provided.
<br>
<p>I must admit that Nixon sounds persuasive (insofar as
<br>
my curiosity about executives' motives goes).  Of course,
<br>
when humans are involved---and especially those humans
<br>
like Nixon, Clinton, and Bush who are very effecting in
<br>
small and large groups of their fellow politicians---
<br>
idealistic motivations can sometimes trump other realities.
<br>
I leave it to those more perceptive than I to offer their
<br>
analyses of Nixon's motivations here.  (I do respect Charles
<br>
Hixson's warning that speeches are designed to appear to be
<br>
sincere.)
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>The excerpt of Matus:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;I have noted, for example, that a Republican Senator has said that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action I have taken means that my party has lost all chance of winning the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; November elections.  And others are saying today that this move against enemy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sanctuaries will make me a one-term President.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No one is more aware than I am of the political consequences of the action I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have taken.  It is tempting to take the easy political path: to blame this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war on previous administrations and to bring all of our men home
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately, regardless of the consequences, even though that would mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defeat for the United States; to desert 18 million South Vietnamese people,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who have put their trust in us and to expose them to the same slaughter and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; savagery which the leaders of North Vietnam inflicted on hundreds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of North Vietnamese who chose freedom when the Communists took
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over North Vietnam in 1954; to get peace at any price now, even though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; know that a peace of humiliation for the United States would lead to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigger war or surrender later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have rejected all political considerations in making this decision.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether my party gains in November is nothing compared to the lives of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 400,000 brave Americans fighting for our country and for the cause of peace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and freedom in Vietnam. Whether I may be a one-term President is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insignificant compared to whether by our failure to act in this crisis the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States proves itself to be unworthy to lead the forces of freedom in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this critical period in world history. I would rather be a one-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President and do what I believe is right than to be a two-term President at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cost of seeing America become a second-rate power and to see this Nation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept the first defeat in its proud 190-year history.&quot;
