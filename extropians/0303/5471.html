<a href="mailto:phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu?Subject=Re:%20[IRAQ]%20polls%20on%20the%20war">phoenix@ugcs.caltech.edu</a> writes: They're opposed to us attacking another 
<br>
nation, not opposing their own nations being involved.  Well, that too, but 
<br>
the main concern is about the attack.  And these are people who were 
<br>
sympathetic with us after 9/11, and were okay with the attack on the Taliban 
<br>
and al Qaeda.  Because there was a connection between 9/11 and al Qaeda, the 
<br>
way there isn't with Iraq.
<br>
<p>Damien,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ask myself why I need make up reasons for France and Germanys 
<br>
opposition to US policy when they have told us their reasons even if somewhat 
<br>
indirectly.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They do sympathize with our losses on 9-11.  They have said so and I 
<br>
for one do not doubt them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However they have also said they fear a severe Moslem reaction to our 
<br>
attacking Iraq.  They have large Moslem populations and fear a misguided 
<br>
retaliation from that minority.  All in all they would be much more 
<br>
comfortable if we stood quietly to have our throats cut.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Secondly, they are doing a lot of business with Sadaam and we are 
<br>
disrupting that business.  We don't buy much of our oil from Sadaam but 
<br>
Europe does.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, after we have won they will be happy to come to the peace 
<br>
table and show us how to arrange things.
<br>
Ron h.
