<br>
<em>&gt;The Soviet experience in Afghanistan is a good example of such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conflict, yet it can be seen from the US experience there a decade
</em><br>
<em>&gt;later that a certain degree of technical superiority, in both equipment
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and training, can largely eliminate any advantage the local anarchists
</em><br>
<em>&gt;may have once had, even when the conqueror is under both media scrutiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and feels bound by international standards of behavior.
</em><br>
<p>Amara said:
<br>
&quot;There was almost no &quot;media scrutiny&quot;, and the Afghans defeated the Soviets
<br>
with guerilla tactics, intelligence, and after the moderates died or
<br>
escaped, a brutal extremism that was the end result of a decade of
<br>
fighting.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Afghans won against the soviets from the tremendous amount of guns,
<br>
missiles, and supplies sent by the United States to supply the Afghan
<br>
resistant against the tyrannicall murderous expansionist soviets.  Leftists
<br>
no longer felt it necessary to even attempt to defend people from murderous
<br>
tyrannical regimes post vietnam.  Your statements parrallel the same
<br>
arguments made just before the US's ousting of the Taliban, that 'the
<br>
Soviets fought them for years and these hardened warriors who knew the
<br>
terrain fought them off!'  Never mind the help they received from the other
<br>
world superpower.  Note that skeptics predicted similiar difficulty with the
<br>
US defeating the Taliban, but with no military backing from a superpower,
<br>
all the 'intelligence and guerilla tactics' of the hardened war machine of
<br>
the Taliban fought off the fall of Kabul for, what, a month?
<br>
<p>Just as the victory in Vietnam belongs to the Soviets, and not the North
<br>
Vietnamese civilians fighting for a 'revolution' (using soviet tanks, guns,
<br>
mines, and artillery) the victory in Afghanastan against the soviet invasion
<br>
belongs to the US.
<br>
<p>This further supports Mike's statements, no amount of intelligence and
<br>
perserverence from guerilla tactic anarchists can defeat a massive statist
<br>
invasion with advanced weaponry and overwhelming firepower.
