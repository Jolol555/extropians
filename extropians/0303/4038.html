<p><em>&gt; [Terry Colvin quotes Laurie Garrett]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I learned that the US economy is the primary drag
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the global economy, and only a handful of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nations have sufficient internal growth to thrive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when the US is stagnating.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; This seems to be a perception of the conference attendees
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I wonder in what sense this is true:
</em><br>
<p>I am skeptical that they'd have phrased it just that way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 1.  Is it merely their perception whether true or untrue?
</em><br>
<p>Of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2.  Are they saying that the American Market is determinative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of all the economies of the world?
</em><br>
<p>Something like that.  The biggest player does have the most
<br>
effect, but there is so much mutual influence that it seems
<br>
unwise to believe in a unique &quot;source&quot; of growth.  The economies
<br>
of many countries around the world, especially in Europe, have
<br>
been pretty bad for a long time, much longer than America's.
<br>
Perhaps it's just that if the U.S. had been exempt from the
<br>
general downturn, things would be much better.
<br>
<p>3.  Are we supplying material that is vital to the economies
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the world?
<br>
<p>Good question, and I wish I knew.  On the one hand the answer
<br>
is obviously &quot;yes&quot; (that's what trade does), but the &quot;vital-
<br>
material&quot; you speak of could be more abstract, such as capital
<br>
or confidence.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; This stuff is important for Americans to realize.
</em><br>
<p>The first part of the former, and all of the latter were simply
<br>
objectively written pieces that appear to reveal a deeper level
<br>
of perceptions than we usually see (e.g., people shouting slogans
<br>
in the streets).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if you believe it is all wrong, we must recognize why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so much of the world dislikes us.  Simply ascribing it to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jealousy or religious fanatics is to ignore the issue.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that's so easy to do.  But it's not necessarily important
<br>
to be liked.  Instead, it's always a question of probing the
<br>
deepest that we can for what's really going on, and what the
<br>
effects of specific policies will turn out to be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Right or wrong, America has very poor PR.  This needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fixed whether one agrees with the accuracy of the complaints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not.
</em><br>
<p>Is PR really the right way to look at it?  The influential 
<br>
people around the world, i.e., the movers and shakers and
<br>
leaders of nations should be thought of as steely-eyed
<br>
bankers who'll in the final analysis make the best moves
<br>
for themselves.  True, they often have to contend with
<br>
inconvenient emotions in their own populations---but then,
<br>
that's their role in their positions of leadership.  I
<br>
think that they'd see right through &quot;PR&quot;.
