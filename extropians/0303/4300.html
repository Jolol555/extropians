<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20PEACE?:%20Gotta%20love%20those%20polls!">samantha@objectent.com</a> writes: When we have federal judges saying that the 
<br>
Constitution is irrelevant to their work then you may be sure that the 
<br>
current government is NOT American except in name alone.  
<br>
<p>Samantha,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me toss in an observation from the homely end of the scale.  The 
<br>
next time you have occasion to be in a traffic court notice whether or not 
<br>
the proceedings are predicated on your admitting your guilt.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you are ever in a traffic court while you are innocent and there is 
<br>
no evidence of your being guilty you can really see confusion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state of Illinois distributes lists of people they believe have no 
<br>
automobile liability insurance.  You may never have occasion to know this but 
<br>
as you drive down the street or highway the traffic police will routinely 
<br>
check to see if you are wanted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A policeman checked me, he got an answer that I was driving without 
<br>
the state required liability insurance.  He pulled me over and told me I had 
<br>
no insurance.  I showed him my proof of insurance.  After consultation with 
<br>
his sergeant, on the radio, he gave me a ticket with a court date.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time I checked and found out that in addition to the Proof of 
<br>
Insurance the state requires us to carry I would need a letter from the 
<br>
Secretary of State.  For most people that work in or around an office that is 
<br>
ridiculously easy to get -- I got the letter.  Before I could get to court I 
<br>
got a 2nd ticket in a 2nd jurisdiction on the same charge.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to court two times (separate jurisdictions) but both times the 
<br>
procedure was the same.  The judge basically could not understand why an 
<br>
innocent person was before him, no proof of my guilt was ever given beyond 
<br>
the reading of the charge, and when I showed my proof of innocence (the state 
<br>
law demands you produce proof any time you are challenged on this particular 
<br>
law) the judge wanted to know what I had done.  He was assuming I was guilty 
<br>
of something or I wouldn't be there so wouldn't I please tell him what it 
<br>
was?  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After five minutes or so of his trying to get me to admit guilt of 
<br>
something and my refusing to know what that might be he decided to quit 
<br>
wasting his time and let me go.  As it was appropriate to the season the 
<br>
first judge wished me a good Thanksgiving and the 2nd wished me a Merry 
<br>
Christmas on my way out of the court.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of the above would be mystifying to me except that as my former 
<br>
occupation caused me to work with trade unions, I once was asked to help my 
<br>
neighbor put together negotiation material to bargain with a village police 
<br>
board and hopefully get the police department a raise.  I helped my neighbor.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I worked on the economic end of the bargaining.  We put together a 
<br>
list of competing occupations for those wishing to hire or retain policemen.  
<br>
Then we got the prevailing pay scales in the area for those competing 
<br>
occupations.  A comparison showed that the village policemen could do much 
<br>
better by moving to another occupation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My friend put together the part of the presentation that explained how 
<br>
the village could pay for the raise that was being requested.  My friend 
<br>
showed the average dollar value of the tickets issued in the recent past and 
<br>
said I know we can raise this by a certain amount.  Now his promise was based 
<br>
purely upon his judgment but other experienced people agreed with him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We got that police department the largest raise that had ever been 
<br>
given.  The policemen were happy as they got a raise, the village was happy 
<br>
as it also made money on the deal.  To summarize the policemen had promised 
<br>
the village more in fines than the village was promising the policemen in 
<br>
wages.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course the local traffic patrolman knew nothing of all this -- it 
<br>
happened above his pay grade.  That is how it is done.  All the patrolman 
<br>
knows is what his sergeant tells him to do along with what ever excuse the 
<br>
sergeant gives him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, back to my experience with the traffic court, it was mystifying 
<br>
as I said.  I don't have any final answers as to what was going on.  But, it 
<br>
was all entirely consistent with the traffic court being part of the revenue 
<br>
producing arm of the local government.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Samantha, the rot in our system starts long before we get into the big 
<br>
courts.  That is all I am saying.
<br>
Ron h.
