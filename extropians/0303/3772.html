By coincidence, I finished this book during the weekend (so I had 
<br>
to avoid reading this and Damien's posts until today).
<br>
<p>I found it one of the best descriptions of a trans/posthuman
<br>
lifestyle I have encountered, a good complement to Walter John
<br>
William's _Aristoi_ and the works of Greg Egan. To me the best
<br>
aspect of the novel was the thought that had gone into customs
<br>
and signs, not just the big setting: how politeness
<br>
works in VR, how mass-minds express how much of them are
<br>
attending to a person, how status can be demonstrated when you 
<br>
can look like anything you want and so on. That is important 
<br>
stuff, since it makes the setting come alive far more than 
<br>
likely extrapolations of uploading technology - and it is the 
<br>
kind of ideas that many people find absent in transhumanism, and 
<br>
hence deduce that we all are inhuman.
<br>
<p>The style is flowery and somewhat redolent of 19th century
<br>
writing. Which seems to fit; the Silver-Gray Mansion reality
<br>
style does have a distinctly Victorian flair (some people
<br>
organise themselves into virtual cultures centered around certain
<br>
AIs and cultural assumptions, not unlike different schools of
<br>
art; the main character subscribes to the Silver-Gray style). I 
<br>
wonder what it is that attracts people to neo-Victorianism? Is 
<br>
that the archetypal culture for anglosaxon writers that want to 
<br>
create something different but recognizable?

<p>It is interesting to track where Phaeton's body actually goes
<br>
physically through the novel; he is moving almost exclusively

vertically. It really shows how geography usually matters almost 
<br>
nothing (and the shock of unmediated reality when you are used to 
<br>
live in super-augmented reality).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Add to this the capability of individuals to alter their brains,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ultimate freedom is the freedom to be wrong.
</em><br>
<p>This is IMHO the main point of the book. Phaeton is a
<br>
strong-willed hero type (or was the swami right in that he was an
<br>
typical villain? Note how Phaeton's true past might be an elegant
<br>
form of self-reference), the kind of ultra-individualist on a
<br>
quest we have seen in _Atlas Shrugged_ or _The Prisoner_. And
<br>
while admirable, he (like the other heros) is also inhuman in his
<br>
stubborness. In a way, he uses his freedom to be wrong to sustain
<br>
his freedom to do what he considers right - but that sense of
<br>
being right, how can he even be sure of it? 
<br>
<p>Of course, the literary style and general thrust of the novel
<br>
probably won't lead to a conclusion where Phaeton's mission
<br>
actually was just a case of megalomania brought on by some clever
<br>
cognitive hacking, but the possibility seems open. And that
<br>
really makes the story fascinating: in a world where minds can be
<br>
edited almost arbitrarily, how can you distinguish truth from
<br>
falsehood? No wonder that Phaeton is a bit unstable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wright's characters describe history in terms of eras called Mental
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Golden Oecumene (&quot;golden age&quot;).  Here is my reconstruction of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That fits well with my impression (I didn't take notes, but 
<br>
mentally tried to form the timeline).
