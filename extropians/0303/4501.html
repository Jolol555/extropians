<p>That's interesting, as the Israeli army has admitted it was an accident. 
<br>
Apparently this was an armored bulldozer with restricted vision. The 
<br>
accounts I read claimed she was protesting the destruction of a house. 
<br>
Apparently the house wasn't given a trial, it was simply demolished. An 
<br>
infant died too, but that's ok, it was an enemy combatant (junior division).
<br>
<p>Hey Mike, how about that guy standing in front of a column of tanks in 
<br>
Tianemenn (sp?) Square? Was he an illegal combatant too? I guess anyone 
<br>
who thinks he was some sort of hero might be considered an enemy 
<br>
combatant too.
<br>
<p>In any case UPI reported some time back that Israel was gonna start 
<br>
killing people at will in the U.S. Those probably won't be reported in 
<br>
the news. So I hardly expect them to refrain from killing Americans in Gaza.
<br>
<p>I hear Iraqi civilians are buying up guns and ammo. Apparently there's 
<br>
plenty of guns in Baghdad. Why don't we just nuke the place? There's 
<br>
probably nobody in the city who isn't an illegal combatant or a war 
<br>
criminal.
