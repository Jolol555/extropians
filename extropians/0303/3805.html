<p><em>&gt; Lee, I think, it's really admirable that you stay cool enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to answer Mike Wiiks cynical proposal with reasonable thoughts.
</em><br>
<p>You thought that was cool?  ;-)  Hardly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This thread started as a satire and it kept going in this spirit.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I know---and I don't have any problem with people having
<br>
a good time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This fantasy of personalizing bullets and bombs with its obvious hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards Iraqui civilians is so utterly disgusting that you cannot ignore it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reason and arguments have long since left this thread. So I answered by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; firing back in the same spirit. Al least I found a term for my political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; viewpoint: I think I am a militant pacifist.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it is really too early to abandon reasoned arguments
<br>
entirely?  Wouldn't you agree that we face enormous trade-offs
<br>
here?  Yes, the risk cuts both ways.  However, we see the
<br>
example I provided where if a country that really was going
<br>
to be posing a future threat could have been brought down
<br>
*before* millions of lives were lost, it would have been a
<br>
good thing.
<br>
<p>The trouble with pacifism is that it merely seems to delay
<br>
the onset of war.  Recall the famous toast by all the fellows
<br>
at Oxford or Cambridge in the late thirties who steadfastly
<br>
refused to support &quot;King and country&quot;.  A few years later they
<br>
were fighting anyway.
<br>
<p>Don't you really think that within a few years at most a Western
<br>
city will be nuked?  Doesn't it make sense to take preventive
<br>
action while we can?  (As above, it's always a risk either way.)
<br>
