<p><em>&gt; &gt;Seriously, I'll bet the Nolan chart pretty well predicts your stance...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh yes, I first used about the Nolan chart some 20 years (?) ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've recommended it on extropians several times. (really... I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my political and philosophical leanings were glaringly obvious, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe not.)
</em><br>
<p>Oh, I wasn't meaning to speak directly to you, Amara, about this.
<br>
Just newbies only  ;-)   the quiz has been mentioned numerous times
<br>
even since I joined.

<p><em>&gt; Maybe it is because there is no &quot;pure&quot; libertarian position on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war. I can see libertarians reach very different conclusions on whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is initiation of force or not, and these conclusions will largely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be based on issues external to libertarian ideology (like how much you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trust the evidence given by different groups, interpretations of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international law etc).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but libertarianism appears to me to lack a cohesive worldview
<br>
as regards war.  IMO, it's one of libertarianism's problems.  The
<br>
Darwinian advent of states, and states at war with each other
<br>
fighting over territory, would be apparent to anyone ignorant of
<br>
humanity who looked at a globe.  The only places not under the 
<br>
direct control of a single nation are those areas that are too
<br>
inhospitable.
<br>
<p>I do not know of any other political orthodoxy that does not
<br>
have a pretty consistent view of war.  But that's entirely
<br>
to be expected, I guess, since libertarianism starts with
<br>
a questioning of the necessity of states.
