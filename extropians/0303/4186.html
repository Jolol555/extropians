<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Wow Gina almost has enough for a haircut! :D

<em>&gt; &gt;I hereby donate my lone ideobuck to Gina so she can cash hers in.

<em>&gt; Sure thing, I never said anything about IDB's being non-transferable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :-) But then the next Nanogirl news would have put her over the
</em><br>
threshold anyhow since I archive those by default. Just the same,
<br>
conjuring a HUD to ping her whuffie...
<br>
<p>While this is an interesting exercise, I generally disapprove of any
<br>
mechanism to extort a peaceful individual to behave according to the
<br>
wishes of others. As philosophers have said, reputation may be what
<br>
others think they know about you, but honor is what you know about
<br>
yourself. Which do you think is more important to personal development?
<br>
<p>As Meredith McMaster Bujold's character Aral Vorkosigan said, &quot;Guard
<br>
your honor closely, and let your reputation fall where it may.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would much rather have a mechanism by which I can judge my own prior
<br>
statements than to have them judged by others. I frankly don't give a
<br>
damn what anybody thinks of the things I say. I'd rather be true to
<br>
myself and whuffie-less than a sell-out to the esteem of others. I
<br>
recognise that this is reflected in my nearly exponential negative
<br>
karma on the ExI BBS. I just don't give a damn.
<br>
<p>Take your whuffie and shove it, or give it to Gina. After all the crap
<br>
she went through, that is the least she deserves. She certainly has MY esteem.
