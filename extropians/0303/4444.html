<br>
US political elite with inferior Republican party members and criminal energy 
<br>
on a megadeath level with simple redneck paranoia. But it was not *any&quot; Mc 
<br>
Donalds manager or a White House cafeteria cook but management comitee 
<br>
members of the House of Representatives who belong to the Republican party 
<br>
who &quot;officially&quot; decided on this Freedom Fries capriole. But you are right. 
<br>
They certainly do not belong to the political elite.  You political leaders 
<br>
are way beyond simple paranoia. They are inhuman future war criminals. 
<br>
Calling them just paranoid would be a bit too polite.
<br>
<p>Humania,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Lighten up.  I don't know how such action would be greeted in whatever 
<br>
country you prefer but here that is treated mostly as a joke.  The French &amp; 
<br>
Germans (reference your language) leaders have been very offensive about our 
<br>
right to defend ourselves.  We wanted to send them a little wake up notice.  
<br>
Others are doing things with a similar intent.  Some are boycotting wine and 
<br>
so forth.  I am told there aren't many boycotting but that it is just enough 
<br>
to be noticeable.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I certainly don't consider your language the reasoned response of 
<br>
Germany, France, nor of any country in the civilized world so I have no 
<br>
intention of becoming angry with anyone based on your words -- cool it dude.
<br>
