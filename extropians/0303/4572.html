<p>
My ISP is under spam attack again. According to first level tech
<br>
support its &quot;some guy&quot; using an algorithm that cycles through letters
<br>
in the alphabet changing some part of an email address or something
<br>
and overloading the ISP's capacity.
<br>
<p>It occurs that this sort of spam attack could be used as a crude
<br>
sort of communications weapon. I'm a sceptical guy and hold to 
<br>
Occam's razor (though I'm not sure I always spell it right). But it 
<br>
does &quot;seem&quot; sometimes that whenever I post on Iraq I loose my 
<br>
ability to communicate in a timely fashion because I don't get
<br>
incoming messages. 
<br>
<p>As a matter of fact in the last few days I've sent an email message to
<br>
the office of the Australian Opposition leader and three other senior
<br>
shadow ministers (defence, attorney general, foreign affairs). I've
<br>
posted on the topic of Iraq to the Washington post (Bob Woodward
<br>
and a couple of reporters) to the American Society of International
<br>
Law list and to the ExI list.
<br>
<p>I can prove (should anyone doubt and care) most of my possibly
<br>
&quot;unlikely&quot; statements. For instance I did get an email receipt from
<br>
the office of the Opposition leader because I have enough experience
<br>
as a lobbyist to look to retain an audit trail and to remove deniability.  
<br>
<p>I suspect my frustrations *are* coincidental but I can understand 
<br>
emotionally why &quot;believers&quot; can jump to conclusions when frustrated.
<br>
I can also see how frustration could be made to make folks look 
<br>
unbalanced. On one occassion at least replies sent to me from the ExI
<br>
list (I could see them on the archive) never arrived at all. Real bounces
<br>
(where posts are lost) seem like pretty stark breakdowns in an ISPs 
<br>
customer service and are unlikely for that reason to occur all too often
<br>
or at least I imagine this perhaps in niavete about ISP quality.
<br>
<p>I also wonder how useful spam attacks of the above sort might be
<br>
as a means of stopping communication between particular users.
<br>
<p>I.e how hard it is to stop someone getting replies in a timely way by
<br>
overwhelming their isp? In my case I am only slightly inconvenienced 
<br>
but if someone is trying to get a message through and they only have 
<br>
my standard email address then, for now, they can't and I can't know
<br>
that they are even trying, unless they are on the ExI list or the ASIL 
<br>
list where I've got other ways of finding out what's sent but not of 
<br>
responding so easily (at this stage). 
<br>
<p>My second email address is <a href="mailto:paatschb@hotmail.com?Subject=Re:%20Spam%20attacks%20again.">paatschb@hotmail.com</a>
<br>
<p>Sorry for the public laundry but there is perhaps a legitimate 
<br>
question in here. Can spam be used in this way, in theory, to 
<br>
frustrate communication deliberately? Seems crude but at least
<br>
it seems to buy some time. Perhaps a major ISP cannot be so
<br>
easily closed down by spam. I know I plan to check out a major
<br>
sometime soon but the changing over is not real convenient.
<br>
<p>Any thoughts? (I won't see them for a bit  ;-) ).
<br>
