</em><br>
<p>Have you considered the possibility that there is no object answer to this
<br>
question? Ambiguity is a normal part of law. That's why we have judges who
<br>
are invested with authority to interpret law and contracts. In the case of
<br>
international law there are no judges that are universally accepted so
<br>
it's up to each country to interpret for themselves and to try to persuade
<br>
other countries of their preferred interpretations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do think that there *is* an answer to the legal question of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether the U.S. (and/or the UK and Australia for that matter)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be acting illegally (i.e.. in breach of the UN Charter) when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they do take military action against Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>Why do you think that? It seems to me that the legal ambiguity in this
<br>
case was deliberate. U.S. wouldn't have accepted Resolution 1441 if it
<br>
definitively bound it to not use force against Iraq without another
<br>
Security Council approval, and France wouldn't have voted for it if it
<br>
clearly authorized the use of force.
<br>
<p>This all makes sense if you assume that the purpose of France was to
<br>
restrain American power as much as possible while not appearing to be too
<br>
unreasonable. Injecting as much ambiguity into the situation as possible
<br>
was the best it could have done given the accepted facts of Iraq's
<br>
continual breach of previous resolutions and the Bush administration's
<br>
strong resolve in this matter. It seems to have achieved that goal
<br>
(although it apparently overplayed its hand near the end and now 
<br>
probably appears more unreasonable than it planned).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Aside: I think it would have been logically valid, moral,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; honourable, and not illegal for President Bush to have, in very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular circumstances, discovered that the US had no further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obligations under the Charter as the Charter itself had been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voided by manifest bad faith on the part of another permanent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security council member. The very lawfulness of the law at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; security council level arises because of the good faith agreement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of security council members and so, imo, when the good faith
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is gone so has the obligation to continue to honour obligations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that were taken on in free exchange for the obligations of others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; President Bush did not in fact take this path however.)
</em><br>
<p>Are you saying that you think France did act in bad faith? Even if that is
<br>
the case, it would be very hard to prove to the world. Certainly Dominique
<br>
de Villepin seems to be smart enough not to leave any clear evidence of
<br>
such bad faith. It would probably cause a diplomatic disaster if the U.S.
<br>
were to withdraw from the U.N. charter at this point without having
<br>
convinced the world. It will be in a stronger position to do that, or
<br>
alternatively to reform the Security Council, after the war with Iraq is
<br>
over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The current situation can be differentiated from Kosovo in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unlike with Kosovo, the Security Council is &quot;seized of the matter&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the US has by signing off on 1441 acknowledged that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UN Security Council is seized of the matter. 
</em><br>
<p>As far as I know this is not a commonly accepted interpretation of the
<br>
phrase &quot;seized of the matter&quot;. See <a href="http://slate.msn.com/id/2079413">http://slate.msn.com/id/2079413</a> for a
<br>
full explanation of what the phrase really means. Here's a quote from it:
<br>
<p>A *small number* [emphasis mine] of international legal experts also
<br>
consider the phrase a linguistic maneuver to head off unilateral action.
<br>
The theory goes that the Security Council is actually hinting to various
<br>
national governments to hold off on, say, sending tanks across the
<br>
Euphrates River, since the dispute is still being adjudicated. If that is
<br>
indeed the case, the phrase's power seems somewhat dubious--nations
<br>
routinely ignore Security Council pleas to remain idle.
