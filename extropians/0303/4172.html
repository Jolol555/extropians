<p>
I saw via slashdot that the New York Times is running an article today
<br>
on new implications of the recent observations of the cosmic microwave
<br>
background (CMB),
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/science/space/11COSM.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/03/11/science/space/11COSM.html</a>.  Ironically
<br>
the new analysis comes from the same Tegmark whose paper on possible
<br>
ways of getting parallel universes has been much discussed in this thread.
<br>
<p>It's ironic because, according to the article, the latest spin on the
<br>
results would violate both of Tegmark's levels one and two, that the
<br>
universe is spatially infinite and that inflation is occuring.  The new
<br>
data hints that the universe has a finite volume, possibly even not
<br>
much bigger than our observable universe!  The edges would &quot;wrap around&quot;
<br>
like in some of the popular space war video games.
<br>
<p>If the universe is finite like this, then there are not multiple copies of
<br>
ourselves scattered throughout space.  And this result is not compatible
<br>
with inflation, either, which predicts an infinite universe.
<br>
<p>However the new data is quite sketchy and this possible interpretation
<br>
is a very dramatic step to take, turning much of cosmology on its head.
<br>
I loved this quote at the end of the article by Dr. Janna Levin:
<br>
<p>&quot;'I suspect every last one of us would be flabbergasted if the universe
<br>
was so small,' she said in an e-mail message. When she first heard about
<br>
the new satellite data, she reported, 'I tried on the idea that we were
<br>
really and truly seeing the finite extent of space and I was filled
<br>
with dread.'&quot;
<br>
<p>I love that: &quot;I was filled with dread&quot;.  Such drama!  People think
<br>
cosmology is all dry analysis and equations, when it's actually the
<br>
most fundamental science there is, asking some of the most important
<br>
questions.  Indeed, I too am horrified at the thought that the universe
<br>
may be so small.
<br>
