<em>&gt;  &gt; Damn! I thought that this was the true topic!

</em><br>
<p><p>It's a common idea for people not familiar with the naturist ideas
<br>
to think that it is about how one looks without clothes. That's
<br>
a mistake, though. It's about being comfortable inside one's body.
<br>
<p>Consider this: if one can't accept their human body (accepting
<br>
'what is' comes before choosing to make changes), do you think
<br>
that they can accept their transhuman body? The answer is No.

<p>Now now Spike. Naturist beaches and resorts are freedom, in an
<br>
ultimate sense. What better way to see the marvelous variety of
<br>
shapes and sizes in which the the human body manifests itself?
<br>
Social roles, economic classes, sex roles reduced or removed,
<br>
and we can be who we are, simply.
<br>
<p>&quot;If it were perfectly natural to go nude, we'd all be born that way.&quot;

<p><p>The following pieces are from: Humorous Introduction to Naturism

<a href="http://www.netnude.com/main/intro.html#intro">http://www.netnude.com/main/intro.html#intro</a>
<br>
<p>{begin quote}
<br>
Nobody knows for certain exactly how many naturists there are in the
<br>
world, but the numbers of those enjoying a clothes optional
<br>
lifestyle appear to be increasing.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, naturism still carries a stigma, born largely of
<br>
ignorance of the truth. To some naturists are well meaning but
<br>
slightly dotty individuals, who meander naked through wooded glades,
<br>
pausing in catalogue poses behind strategically placed leaves. To
<br>
others, they are immoral hedonists, congregating in mixed groups to
<br>
enjoy pleasures of the flesh in orgy situations not seen since
<br>
Caesar hung up his laurels. Or they are perverts trying to corrupt
<br>
the 'normal'way of life. As with the majority of prejudices based on
<br>
lies, misunderstandings and half-truths, the reality of life for the
<br>
average naturist is very different indeed.
<br>
<p>I COULD NEVER BE A NUDIST ANYWAY - JUST LOOK AT MY BODY!
<br>
<p>That's the whole point though. Naturism isn't about looking at
<br>
bodies - naturists are not exhibitionists. It's just about enjoying
<br>
the freedom that a clothes optional atmosphere brings. Naturism is
<br>
about accepting the human body for what it is - nothing to be
<br>
ashamed of. So the men don't need to hit the gym for six months,
<br>
buffing their muscles to within an inch of their lives in order to
<br>
gain entry. And the women don't have to look like Baywatch babes.
<br>
The media is largely responsible for promoting this idea of body
<br>
perfection, but the truth is that the vast majority of people do not
<br>
now, nor are they likely to ever resemble this false ideal.
<br>
<p>So for naturists there is no such thing as too fat, too thin, too
<br>
short, too tall, too hairy. Nobody's going to comment on the size or
<br>
shape of your breasts or critically evaluate your genitalia. And if
<br>
you have any surgical scars or other distinguishing marks you
<br>
needn't worry - ignore them just like everyone else will. For most
<br>
people, their initial discomfort disappears very quickly, once they
<br>
realize they are not being judged on their appearance.
<br>
<p>BUT WHAT DO PEOPLE GET OUT OF IT? IF IT'S NOT ABOUT SEX, JUST WHAT
<br>
IS IT ABOUT?
<br>
<p>It's about relaxation, freedom from restriction - and to a very
<br>
large degree, it's about honesty.
<br>
<p>Naturists are judged on their personalities alone. They take away
<br>
the trappings that most of us have around us every day. They have
<br>
less to 'hide behind'. This is very healthy, because it means that
<br>
friendships are built on truth - as people get used to being open
<br>
with each other, there is less temptation to embellish![...]
<br>
<p>Being nude can also be incredibly relaxing. The feeling of air, sun
<br>
and water on the skin is a terrific stress reliever.  [...]
<br>
<p>IT CAN'T BE HEALTHY FOR CHILDREN THOUGH, SURELY.
<br>
<p>On the contrary, children who grow up in a naturist environment
<br>
usually have far fewer hang-ups than other kids. Once again, they
<br>
are not being subjected to premature sexual situations - they grow
<br>
up around other children and adults, understanding that the body is
<br>
not something to be hidden and ashamed of. They know anatomy of the
<br>
human body, and it is less of a 'taboo' to be explored at the
<br>
earliest opportunity. There are fewer incidences of teenage
<br>
pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases and criminal behaviour
<br>
amongst nudist children than amongst other children.
<br>
<p>WHERE WOULD I PUT MY SUNGLASSES!?
<br>
<p>As for the sunglasses, well friends have found that nipple rings are
<br>
the perfect holders for their Ray Bans. If you don't fancy body
<br>
piercing, though, a small bag slung around your neck or carried with
<br>
you is the perfect repository for your small change and other
<br>
necessities.
