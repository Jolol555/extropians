Amara
<br>
Sometime last Fall (not sure when), Berlusconi's government passed a
<br>
law that allowed any of the 3 million illegal people in this country
<br>
to pay 400 euros, fill out some papers, and have a legal permit of
<br>
stay. One million of those followed through, giving the government a
<br>
bit of money in the process.
<br>
<p>### A similar law (Martelli's law), for illegal people living in Italy,
<br>
was issued circa 10 years ago. The new one (Bossi-Fini law) applies
<br>
to illegal people, living in Italy, if they can show they were working,
<br>
and supporting themselves. Anyway the point is: this is the Italian new
<br>
industry, our new economy. Actually we have lost, in the last 30 years, 
<br>
our chemical industry (Montedison, etc.), our electronic industry
<br>
(Olivetti, etc.), our mechanical/motor/car industry (Fiat, etc.).
<br>
Thus, as you wrote, Italy, our social system, our economy, our welfare
<br>
system needs people coming from abroad, the &quot;extracomunitari&quot;.
<br>
Unfortunately, given the EU, even people coming from US, or Australia,
<br>
or Canada, are &quot;extracominitari&quot; now. And this seems - to me - a bit
<br>
paradoxical. Maybe it is just a sign of what, in the future, we'll call
<br>
the US-EU divide.
<br>

<br>
It is well worth considering that Italy has a higher cultural
<br>
power distance (50 in Hofstede's study) than Germany (35) and
<br>
Sweden (31) (USA: 40) and a higher uncertainty avoidance
<br>
(Sweden 29, USA 46, Germany 65, Italy 75). At the same time
<br>
individualism is higher (Germany 67, Sweden 71, Italy 76, USA
<br>
91). So following rules and authorities is very important, but
<br>
one acts as an individual.
<br>
<p>### Many authors here wrote that &quot;Italy is not a nation&quot;.
<br>
And never was a country. It is just a collection of old little 
<br>
states, very often speaking different languages (i.e. French,
<br>
and German too). And one of the largest was the &quot;Stato Pontificio&quot;,
<br>
the Pope! All that could easily explain the (above) statistics.
