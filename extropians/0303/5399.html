<p>It's strange - these articles are quite unclear about how exactly these
<br>
fuel cells would work in the body.  They hint very obliquely that the fuel
<br>
cells might generate power from blood, but they never come out and say it!
<br>
<p>The closest they come is explaining that conventional fuel cells run on
<br>
either hydrogen gas or liquid methanol, but that more exotic fuels like
<br>
glucose or formate can also be used, and in theory a &quot;range of fuels&quot;
<br>
is possible.  Does that mean blood?  They don't say.
<br>
<p>They talk about fuel cells replacing batteries in portable electronics
<br>
and medical implants.  Obviously the refueling situation is completely
<br>
different for these two examples, yet they are mentioned in the same
<br>
sentence.
<br>
<p>And finally they talk about the new fuel cells working under pulsating
<br>
conditions like blood flow in the body.  Again, they never actually say
<br>
the fuel cells would derive power from blood.
<br>
<p>It's a very strange article, because it seems to me that the most exciting
<br>
and remarkable aspect of this technology would be that it fuels itself
<br>
from your blood just like your own cells do.  Yet they never mention this,
<br>
they just kind of dance around and hint at it.  Bizarre.
