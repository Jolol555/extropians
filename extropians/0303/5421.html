Okay, Mr. Dickey, one more time:
<br>
<p>The United States can be the greatest power in the World. I do not mind at
<br>
all. And I have stated this a dozen times before. You Americans can be the
<br>
winner in all human categories, in all sports, art and anything else. I do
<br>
not mind. Because I have symathy with the loosers and the weak. Winners and
<br>
heroes do not necessarily attract me.
<br>
<p>But what I FEAR is one war after the other on countries that seem unpopular
<br>
to the US.

<p><p><em>&gt; Mania said
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But what I fear is that this war might be the first step towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a new world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; order where the law of the strongest, i. e. USA reigns.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, so the truth finally comes out!  The sole reason mania opposes this
</em><br>
war
<br>
<em>&gt; is because the US is too big and strong!  God forbid a free, democractic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constitutional republic be the worlds strongest power!!  As MaxPlumm has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repeatedly pointed out, no country has done more than the US to spread
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy throughout the world, yet Mania sees such a country as the
</em><br>
worlds
<br>
<em>&gt; strongest as a bad thing!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would invite Mania, and others, to consider a world where either one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these countries were the strongest in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam Hussains IRAQ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kim Jong Il's North Korea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mao Ze Dong's China
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I will not stop shouting, I am against THIS war. You are deadly wrong
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you should hear it again every day!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well the more you shout the more likely we are to listen to you, correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I said in my post, unless you address the reasons why those who support
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the war support it, you will not disuade anyone.  It seems your primary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation for opposing this war *anyway* is that you merely dont want the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US to be strong.  Instead of Might makes right, its now might makes wrong!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I should further point out, that at least for Robert Bradbury and I,
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; are deadly wrong, and your opinions may lead to the end of the human race.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;As Robert Bradbury pointed out, leaving Saddam in power will cause
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;deaths of Iraqi people then taking him out of power.  He asked anyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;to present a reasonable challenge to that notion, and received no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;responses as of yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I didn't reply because I don't believe the general case or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; especially this specific case can be reduced to such simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equations.  If it a few less people die due to one course over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the other immediately but set into motion a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; repurcussions that lead to many more deaths this clearly would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not be a win.  But there is no way to easily quantify these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fuller costs.  Those the equation is not of much value to me at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Samantha, as I just pointed out to Mania, to at least Robert and I, *your*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinions could lead to the end of all human life on earth.  Perhaps with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this perspective of ours you will understand why we (and perhaps other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporters of this war) do not find your arguments in the least bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compelling.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am not in the least &quot;clueless&quot; about this.  Unfortunately for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your argument it has nothing to with our current actions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iraq. Do you believe with Mr. Bush that they &quot;want us dead&quot; just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because they are E-V-I-L and we are so filled with Light and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that is Good?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aha! I say...  Here I get the feeling the ultimate objection that Samantha
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and possibly Mania have) is that to acknowledge this war is just is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acknowledge that there is *actually* a country out there that is indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse than the United States.
</em><br>
