<p>Public Choice?  I.e., concentrated interests trump diffuse interests.
<br>
Net tax consumers don't have much incentive to lobby for higher
<br>
taxes, as no one of them can expect to directly benefit from their
<br>
efforts.  The few who pay really substantial amounts have a far
<br>
stronger, if still weak, individual incentive to lobby.  What about
<br>
all the rich leftists?  Well, _top marginal_ tax rates have gone
<br>
down, way down, over the past several decades throughout the
<br>
industrialized world.  Explain that fact.  Well, I will -- rich
<br>
leftists want everyone to pay through the nose (and the leftists
<br>
get to control the booty, concentrated interests again, you see),
<br>
rich non-leftists want at least their own taxes to be lower.  The
<br>
actions of each lead to what we have -- lower marginal rates,
<br>
creeping overall tax burden -- but not pure mobocracy.  Sounds good
<br>
to me, but hey, it's never hard to pretend to explain the past.
