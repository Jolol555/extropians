Hal, thank you very much for this explanation. At one point in the paper
<br>
it said &quot;Although the government G* defined in Section 3 is intuitively
<br>
easy to understand...&quot; and I was thinking what kind of drugs are these
<br>
people on, because I really need to get some!
<br>
<p>However it seems that the scheme you describe is not exactly what the
<br>
paper suggests, and the difference is an important one to understand.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; total amount which will be spent on the public good, and the amount of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tax the person is going to have to pay based on his current dial setting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turning the dial to the right slightly increases the total amount which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be spent (not much, though, if there are thousands or millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; voters), and also changes the amount of tax which that person will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay.  The tax will be minimized when the dial is set at roughly the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean value of everyone else's choice, and will go up as the knob turns
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to influence the amount spent on the public good against their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willingness to pay taxes to make their voice heard.
</em><br>
<p>In the paper, the decision is just one-shot, without this dynamic feedback
<br>
process. Everyone is assumed to already know the average M before the
<br>
whole things starts. One might ask what's the purpose of the mechanism
<br>
then, if everyone already knows the outcome? Apparently the implicit
<br>
assumption is that everyone knows except the government, and the
<br>
government needs this mechanism to find out the answer. If my
<br>
interpretation is correct, this seems to make the Groves-Ledyard mechanism
<br>
useless in real world situations, where the real average M is unknown,
<br>
because people would be taxed less on how much their preferences differ
<br>
from the average, and more on their ability to guess the correct average.
<br>
This seems to be rather unjust and unlikely to be widely adopted. It also
<br>
means that you can't just ignore the public goods that you're not
<br>
interested in. You have to become an expert in every one so that you can
<br>
guess the correct average preference.
<br>
<p>In your dynamic scheme, things don't quite work because everyone has an
<br>
incentive to lie until right before the end. Suppose you have a greater
<br>
than average preference for the public good. You would want to turn your
<br>
dial as high as possible to create the impression that the average
<br>
preference is higher than it really is. This gives an incentive to
<br>
everyone else to turn their dials higher (closer to the average) to reduce
<br>
the &quot;non-conformity tax&quot;. You can then switch back to a lower setting one 
<br>
second before the vote ends. If everyone knows this, of course, they'll 
<br>
just disregard any display of the current average and this scheme becomes 
<br>
equivalent to the original one-shot scheme.
<br>
<p>Sorry to shoot your ideas down, Hal. I hope you don't give up!
