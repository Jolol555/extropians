<p>Very good question (imo). And I agree with your implication 
<br>
that there can be a variety of reasons for not trusting someone
<br>
and that it is not necessary to think someone is dishonest not 
<br>
to trust them. Please allow me to fork this thread so that I can
<br>
address both the specific question that you raise about why 
<br>
people distrust President Bush as well as the more general and
<br>
very interesting (to me at least) question of how and why people
<br>
trust (or distrust) other people generally. (I will return to your
<br>
specific question next.)
<br>
<p>Trust is quite complicated. But to handle it intellectually and 
<br>
to operationalise it in real life I slice it this way. When I 
<br>
consider trusting others I think in terms of their motives 
<br>
AND in terms of their judgement. (I don't know if others
<br>
think of trust in this way. But I'd like to know. I think some 
<br>
may do it similarly to me but perhaps less 'formally'.) 
<br>
<p>In terms of motive, I can usually determine, based on previous
<br>
information I have gathered, whether or not the person under
<br>
consideration is well or adversely disposed to me. Clearly, if
<br>
they wish me harm and I recognize that, then I won't trust
<br>
&nbsp;them. And often this approach to trust isn't that useful when
<br>
considering interactions with strangers.
<br>
<p>That consideration of the other's motives is the first part of 
<br>
trust. The other aspect of trust is consideration of the others
<br>
judgement. 
<br>
<p>I would not trust my mother to fly a jumbo jet. She is not 
<br>
trained. She has very little practical conception of the laws
<br>
of physics. She would mean well but she would get herself,
<br>
me and whoever else happened to be on the plane killed 
<br>
- almost certainly. Judgement of the judgement (and skills
<br>
and competence of the other) has to be a factor in trust. 
<br>
I can think of no circumstances where it would be
<br>
useful to ask myself the question is the person who seems
<br>
to want me to trust them (explicitly or implicitly) a good 
<br>
person or an evil person. Strictly speaking, I never fully 
<br>
trust anyone, including myself, because of the judgment 
<br>
aspect of trust. But perhaps my approach to trust is 
<br>
unusual. I would really like to hear what others think
<br>
about the general nature of trust. I think that such a discussion
<br>
would be very healthy anytime but perhaps especially now.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
