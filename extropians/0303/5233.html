<p><em>&gt; Obviously the at least perceived anti-western attitudes of many muslims

<p>Cards on the &quot;credo&quot; table time. I have gotten along well with some people 
<br>
who call themselves Muslims--or I *think* I have. But since then I've 
<br>
learned that a smile can be a sign of discomfort, too; so I might not have 
<br>
a clue what was _really_ going on. This is part of the classic existential 
<br>
puzzle.
<br>
<p>For all I know, someday this post will be used to issue a fatwa on me. My 
<br>
hopes and my fears are counterparts.
<br>
<p>At this time, the-me-whom-I-am-today finds Shariya (Islamic theocracy) 
<br>
incompatible with the kind of place I'd like to live in, or (perhaps) be 
<br>
resuscitated to after being cryonically suspended. This is entirely 
<br>
separate from the question of whether or not such a world, or indeed any 
<br>
future world, would &quot;want&quot; to bring me back.
<br>
<p>So: a world government based on Shariya is not one I-right-now can support.
<br>
<p>In the spirit of minding my own business, I have for many years been 
<br>
willing to tolerate the fact that Shariya is in force in various places 
<br>
around the world--I have not felt obligated to do anything about it, though 
<br>
I wince at what I perceive as some of its secular effects. Ergo, I 
<br>
conjecture I could accept being brought back to a world where some fraction 
<br>
of the population was still subject to it.
<br>
<p>What fraction? I don't know. Not me, thanks.
<br>
<p>Now, is there such a thing as &quot;Shariya lite&quot;? Is there such a thing as 
<br>
genuine peaceful coexistence with the current crop of &quot;advocates&quot; of global 
<br>
Shariya, given their tactics and rhetoric? I have serious doubts.
<br>
<p>Are the advocates of global Shariya correct in their claims that all who 
<br>
call themselves Muslims but do not institute/promote Shariya are false, and 
<br>
worse than infidels? I don't know. But the fact of the outspoken claim 
<br>
bodes ill, and cannot prudently be ignored.
<br>
<p>I also agree with some of the Shariya proponents, and others, that there 
<br>
are signs that the Western culture/system I grew up in is sick, or fragile, 
<br>
or vulnerable, in some significant ways; and I conseqently fear that it 
<br>
might not be able to perk up, clean up, and successfully memetically 
<br>
compete with a vibrant theocratic movement of one sort or another in the 
<br>
long run. What to do?
<br>
<p>Ask me again in 20 or 40 years.
<br>
<p>I can imagine all sorts of weird future end-runs that would make Shariya 
<br>
more tolerable---want to vote, woman? change your sex, go vote, just make 
<br>
sure you get back to the kitchen before Hubby gets back from work; want to 
<br>
steal--OK, we cut off your hand and you don't get to have a new one for a 
<br>
month---
<br>
<p>But that's very much not the world we live in today.
