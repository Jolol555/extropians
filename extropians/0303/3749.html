</em><br>
<em>&gt; How do we be *effective* within democracies? Excellent question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have just one vote each.
</em><br>
<p>Nah.  Voting is for sissies.  If all you do is vote, then
<br>
you won't have any more power than any other citizen.  As
<br>
we are wiser than they, mere voting is practically immoral.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But far, far more importantly, we have in open societies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right to free speech, including free speech about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government and free speech about policy.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, right on.  But still, just freely expressing your opinion,
<br>
writing articles in magazines, giving speeches, publishing
<br>
books or news pamphlets, joining on-line discussion groups,
<br>
posting a blog, meeting with friends, acquaintances, and
<br>
&quot;action&quot; groups---this is still pretty wimpy if you really
<br>
want to get something done.
<br>
<p>How can we in good conscious merely restrain ourselves to
<br>
that, when people may die, and many developments unhealthy
<br>
for children and other living things are occurring?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The right sort of knowledge can be power indeed when it is coupled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with passion and a willingness to effect policy through the prudent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exercise of the right to free speech.
</em><br>
<p>Prudent?  Prudent??  That's the problem.  People are being
<br>
responsible and prudent.
<br>
<p>To have more effect, (1) take to the streets whenever possible
<br>
to obtain the maximal media exposure  (2) wage noisy and loud
<br>
campaigns to inconvenience as many citizens as possible;  this
<br>
is what really gets your message out  (4) use spam and telemarketing
<br>
(4) finally, as opposed to (1) and (2) and (3), have the most
<br>
impassioned, idealistic, and dedicated members of your organization
<br>
break laws, commit mayhem, sabotage competing groups through
<br>
disinformation and propaganda.
<br>
<p>It is the responsibility of those who have superior moral
<br>
consciousness to raise the consciousness of everyone else.
<br>
It is up to the vanguard.  Now, lots of other people might
<br>
think that *they* are right (or in the vanguard), but it's
<br>
really us who are.  Therefore, instead of meekly following
<br>
the &quot;prudent&quot; and &quot;responsible&quot; course above, we must lead.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p>P.S.  All of the foregoing is written in the tone of the
<br>
greatest possible sarcasm.  A republic descends to mobocracy
<br>
the moment that a sufficient number of people begin to think
<br>
like the above.
