Hi!
<br>
<p>Robert, I understand how we can apply whole genome engineering to 
<br>
microbes--particularly since I'm a microbiologist. Yet I imagine that you 
<br>
want to do the same for humans. May I ask how? Or is it some sort of 
<br>
industrial secret. My reasoning is that for microbes we have dozens of 
<br>
genomes from which not only we can analyze what are the important parts, 
<br>
but also how to engineer a microbe's genome to suit our tasks--or even 
<br>
create a whole genome from scratch as I believe some scientists are trying 
<br>
to. My problem with engineering the human genome is that we need a lot more 
<br>
mammalian genomes. You mention we can &quot;patch our genomes using 
<br>
intracellular bacteria&quot;. The idea is certainly exciting, and I sure hope 
<br>
you can make it real in a few years. But I can think of so many technical 
<br>
problems in the idea that I wonder how you will pull it off. Even so I wish 
<br>
you the best of luck.
<br>
<p>As for HIV, I'm sure we will eventually find a cure. My argument is that 
<br>
the pace at which developments at a molecular level have been made in the 
<br>
fight against HIV will not suffice if we are to find ways to cure aging 
<br>
within a reasonable future. They won't even suffice to cure cancer. So we 
<br>
need faster ways to gather data, interpret results, and develop effective 
<br>
interventions in medical science. You give a few examples of how things are 
<br>
shaping up and I certainly hope they do because the current pace of medical 
<br>
progress won't be enough.
<br>
<p>Finally, I'm totally in favor of a comparative genomics approach to study 
<br>
aging. As I mentioned in previous e-mails, I've been trying to publish an 
<br>
article on the subject for months now. Yet my approach is based on 
<br>
mammalian genomes, since I estimate several of these will be available long 
<br>
before we have, say, a turtle's genome.
<br>
<p>All the best.
<br>
<p>Joao
