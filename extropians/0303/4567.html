</em><br>

</em><br>

<p>Thanks for bringing this up, Lee. I was discussing this very subject with 
<br>
some colleagues at work this afternoon. I was trying to determine the 
<br>
difference between what is going on now with Iraq and the other incedents you 
<br>
mentioned above. I think in some ways that it comes down to approach and 
<br>
overall level of media exposure (of course there are gazillions of other 
<br>
factors, but hear me out).
<br>
<p>Approach-wise, I would say that the coalition (in the case of Bosnia, not 
<br>
terribly familiar with the Rwanda crisis, sorry to say) took the stance of 
<br>
&quot;peacekeepers&quot; rather than &quot;invaders&quot;. Everyone agreed that Milosovic was an 
<br>
evil man, and that we should go in and stop his troops from their &quot;ethnic 
<br>
clensing&quot; activities. I can't remember ever seeing a single person protesting 
<br>
that the US shouldn't go in and help out those that would be opressed. I 
<br>
really don't see much difference between what occurred there versus what has 
<br>
been happening in Iraq. 
<br>
<p>BUT... I think that part of the problem is that a lot of people really do see 
<br>
Bush's tactics as &quot;Cowboy mentality&quot;, even if his motives are purely to 
<br>
liberate the people. How different would the situation be today if the Bush 
<br>
administration maintained an approach as &quot;peacekeepers&quot; and &quot;guardians of the 
<br>
human rights of hte Iraqi people&quot;, rather than acting like the sheriff coming 
<br>
into town to tell the bad guy to get outta dodge? Does anybody recall if we 
<br>
offered Milosovic an ultimatum? That whole era is kind of fuzzy to me, which 
<br>
brings me to my second point....
<br>
<p>Media Exposure:
<br>
The Gulf states have had the &quot;benefit&quot; of a previous conflict in very recent 
<br>
history that involved a great many nations, and as a consequence recieved a 
<br>
large amount of press coverage. From what I can recall, events in Kosovo, 
<br>
Rwanda, etc. did not have nearly as much exposure, so the general public was 
<br>
pretty much oblivious (The &quot;far away land&quot; syndrome I like to call it, and I 
<br>
am just as guilty as the rest of us!). We knew for sure we were doing the 
<br>
right thing, and our allies were cooperating with as a coherent team (that's 
<br>
just my perception of what happened over there, I could be wrong!). I'm not 
<br>
exactly sure why humanitarian disasters get less coverage or stay in the 
<br>
public mind less, but maybe it has a little to do with the fact that we get 
<br>
into our gas-guzzling automobiles every day, and we react very negatively 
<br>
when the price of gas goes up further than we think it should. Anybody else 
<br>
have some other ideas about what makes this event different than ones in the 
<br>
past???
