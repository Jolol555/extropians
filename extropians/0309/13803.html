</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;The fundamental premise of classical liberalism is an assumption that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people are basically rational and wise.

Samantha's response
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually, original &quot;liberalism&quot; is built on the assumption that you can so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limit the legalized power of others over yourself as to not need to worry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overly much about how rational or wise others are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Well yes but is my response, I'm closer to Anders and Brin on this. The
<br>
above is a true, succinct statement of the political essense of classical
<br>
liberalism but I think that political argument assumes the rationality of
<br>
the majority. If the majority are not rational then the political project of
<br>
limiting the legalised power of others over oneself would not be
<br>
practicable. The sensible strategy would be to pursue power so as to protect
<br>
yourself. I think one of the two fundamental questions that divide people in
<br>
modern times is &quot;Can you trust people to decide things for themselves?&quot;
<br>
Classical liberals would say yes because people are broadly rational, learn
<br>
from mistakes, have access to knowledge that others do not (such as knowing
<br>
what they most value) while others would either say no you can't trust
<br>
people because they are ignorant/emotional/culture bound/gene driven or
<br>
whatever or that there is some revealed good way of living that should trump
<br>
people's subjective choices. The hidden premiss of the latter argument is
<br>
that there is an elite (the expert professionals in Brin's analysis) who
<br>
know better than the rest of us what's good for us. I'm reminded of what
<br>
Gladstone said when asked to define liberalism &quot;Trust the people&quot;. (The full
<br>
version was &quot;Liberalism is trust in the people tempered by prudence, Toryism
<br>
is mistrust of the people tempered by fear&quot;)
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But I do not think people in all cultures operate wisely and rationally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cultures endorse behavior, and some cultures are not very rational.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Therfore, some cultures do not operate very well at all. For example, I
</em><br>
do
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not think there are any rational cultures in Africa, as far as I can
</em><br>
tell.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Classical liberalism is not concerned with &quot;cultures&quot; or any other
</em><br>
collective.
<br>
<em>&gt; It is concerned with individuals and keeping them free to follow their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - samantha
</em><br>
<p>Couldn't agree more. There's a lot of sloppy thinking going on about
<br>
'cultures' these days, often with the unspoken assumption that culture is
<br>
destiny.
