</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But they are harder to construct, and much more theoretically 
<br>
intractible than zero sum games.  In fact, the last I heard the only 
<br>
ones that could be effectively dealt with on a theoretic basis were the 
<br>
ones that could be decomposed and transformed into a much more 
<br>
complicated pair of zero-sum games.  But that this covered only a 
<br>
fragment of the available forms.  (OTOH, this was 3 decades ago, and at 
<br>
the undergraduate level.)

</em><br>
<p>At any particular time the earth has a limited amount of wealth. 
<br>
Actually, on theoretical grounds one could maintain that there was a 
<br>
finite limit on the possible amount of wealth deriveable from the earth 
<br>
over any specific finite span of time.  But I don't know how one could 
<br>
estimate how close we were to the theoretic limits.  And knowledge plays 
<br>
a big role here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;And yes, there are alternative value economic theories, Marx is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;standard, I like the modifications by Istvan Meszaros.
</em><br>

<em>&gt; Ah, and so many extropian list members thought there were no communists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on board.  Jeff Davis, you have a buddy, someone who shares your idea
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a moral communist state can exist.  Sure, it may, but no communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state has ever come close to being moral, and Robbie, I am surprised to...

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<p>And you can come up with an example of some other government that was 
<br>
even approximately moral?  I can't.  The more history I studied, the 
<br>
less moral governments appeared.  Stalin was unusual in that prior 
<br>
&quot;incarnations&quot; had to use cruder technologies.  But you could ask the 
<br>
Comanche about the morality of the US.  Or the Mohicans, if you could 
<br>
find any.  Or the Iriquois.  Or...  But finding another government that 
<br>
was any better would be quite difficult.  Canada, perhaps.  But then I 
<br>
haven't studied their history.  Nepal.  But then they've never had the 
<br>
power to be evil on a large scale.
