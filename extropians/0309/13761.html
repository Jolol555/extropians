<p>No argument.  But for people that crave sugar -- it looks like Alteon
<br>
may have a near term solution -- vs. may other aging related problems
<br>
where we are a decade away or more.
<br>
<p>The promotion of obesity/diabetes/insulin resistance issues are complex
<br>
because it looks like Insulin-Like-Growth-Factor (or related hormones)
<br>
are involved.  Those in turn may be related to the &quot;rate&quot; of operation
<br>
of the mitochondria which in turn may be related to free radical production
<br>
and damage to DNA which in turn may be related to DNA double strand breaks
<br>
and repair which corrupts the genetic code.  So in general, I would agree
<br>
that it seems like a good idea to avoid 'spikes'.  We probably are not
<br>
naturally evolved to handle them.  But in terms of what kills us I'd
<br>
place more emphasis on obesity rather than on 'spikes'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Actually I meant to ask about this...I though the FDA had banned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aspartame in the USA due to finding problems with brain damage in kids?
</em><br>
<p>Nada.  I just read the label on the bottle of diet coke in my fridge
<br>
and in addition to caffeine, aspartame is on the ingredient list.
<br>
Interestingly it also has a warning about containing phenylalanine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most britons I talk to seem to believe this. Is it not true?
</em><br>
<p>I have heard that there is a strong debate over aspartame.  I did a
<br>
limited amount of research on this a few months ago but did not find
<br>
anything that would scare me into not drinking it.
<br>
<p>It may be yet another one of those substances where due to genetic
<br>
differences &quot;your mileage may vary&quot;.  So its a complicated mess --
<br>
one may deny oneself the sensual pleasures of life making life
<br>
really uninteresting, causing depression that leads to suicide, OR
<br>
one may consume a natural substance (glucose) that may accelerate
<br>
protein glycosylation and may promote obesity and therefore a somewhat
<br>
premature death, OR one may consume aspartame which may not make one
<br>
age faster but may alter ones brain chemistry in undetermined ways.
<br>
<p>So, pick your poison.
<br>
<p>Robert
