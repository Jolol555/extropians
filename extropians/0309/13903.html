Robbie and Rafal... you are slinging the term 'morality' back and forth 
<br>
unexamined as if it's an objective concept you both agree on and merely 
<br>
disagree on the details of implementation. I recently posted something 
<br>
on the Genomics Yahoogroup that has just become relevant here...
<br>
<p>----------
<br>
One of the problems plaguing the field of ethics is a pair of 
<br>
contradictory assumptions at its very core:
<br>
<p>&quot;Some things are right and some things are wrong, and we need to know 
<br>
the difference.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.&quot;
<br>
<p>I propose that ethics should be redefined as...
<br>
<p>&quot;An ontology for clearly stating what your particular system of axioms 
<br>
is, coming to logical conclusions/decisions based on these axioms, and 
<br>
communicating your axioms and your process of reasoning based on them to 
<br>
others.&quot;
<br>
<p>Here's an example of how this more honest and rigorous approach to 
<br>
ethics would work:
<br>
<p>Bob is a Christian. Bob states his axioms.
<br>
<p>&quot;I hold the following beliefs to be axiomatic-- God exists, and the 
<br>
Bible expresses God's will. In places where the Bible is not clear, the 
<br>
literal interpretation is to favored.&quot;
<br>
<p>Bob then states his conclusions.
<br>
<p>&quot;Based on what is written in the Bible, killing humans is wrong, unborn 
<br>
fetuses are human, and therefore abortion is wrong.&quot;
<br>
<p>Jane is a secular humanist. Jane does not share Bob's axioms, but 
<br>
aknowledges that they are axioms and not directly subject to debate. She 
<br>
can do the following, though...
<br>
<p>a) She can point out contradictions within Bob's chosen set of axioms, 
<br>
forcing him to assign priorities to the various axioms he holds.
<br>
<p>b) She can challenge the chain of reasoning leading from Bob's axioms 
<br>
(the Bible expresses God's will) to Bob's conclusions (abortion is wrong).
<br>
<p>c) If the above approaches both fail, Jane and Bob can agree to disagree.
<br>
<p>Note that in the event of c), this disagreement isn't always peaceful, 
<br>
unfortunately. As an extreme example, if Bob's axioms were to explicitly 
<br>
include the statement &quot;Blow up abortion clinics&quot; and Jane was an 
<br>
owner/employee/customer of an abortion clinic, then Bob and Jane will 
<br>
inevitably find themselves in conflict at whatever level permitted by 
<br>
the society they exist in and their level of commitment to their 
<br>
respective axioms. But at least Bob, Jane, and any bystanders would have 
<br>
a clear idea of what specifically the conflict was about... and whether 
<br>
or not the underlying issue has been resolved, voiding the conflict. For 
<br>
example, if safe and inexpensive removal/storage/transplantation of 
<br>
embryos became possible, Bob and Jane would no longer have reason to 
<br>
quarrel-- after all, Bob never stated that &quot;Sex without intent to 
<br>
procreate is wrong&quot; and Jane never stated that &quot;fetuses must be killed&quot;.
<br>
<p>Instead of this, ethics debates today seem to rely on appeal to 
<br>
authority and some kind of imaginary universal concept of right and 
<br>
wrong. It's FRAUDULENT to use value-implying terms without first clearly 
<br>
identifying your values so your audience can make up their own minds as 
<br>
to whether your idea of &quot;right&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, and &quot;humane&quot; 
<br>
corresponds to their own. The approach I've outlined above will help 
<br>
expose individuals who are trying to conceal their own agenda underneath 
<br>
some kind of blanket &quot;consensus&quot; or &quot;prevailing social norms&quot;.
<br>
<p>There should be something equivalent to Godwin's Law that gets triggered 
<br>
when someone talks about 'morality' without saying exactly what that 
<br>
word signifies to them.
<br>
<p>PS: The original purpose of this thread was to figure out how not to get 
<br>
the crack-pot treatment from fellow scientists at a vulnerable, early 
<br>
point in our careers. But what the heck, ethics is an interesting and 
<br>
important topic too.
