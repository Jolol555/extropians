</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Mormonism is *much* younger than Islam but not at all violent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Besides, can the world afford to have a violent teenager over 1.3 billion

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have an opinion regarding the 'age' of a religion, but I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that religions evolve in time, and the violent aspects do check
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip good stuff]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One example of such a person is Nasr Hamid Abu Zeid. He is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Egyptian teacher, and was a professor of Arabic Literature at Cairo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; University, who has written some works that interpret the Koran in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the context of life at the time that the Koran was written. In his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book: _Criticism of Religious Discourse_, he writes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Since language develops with the development of society and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture, providing new ideas and developing its terminology to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express more developed relations, then it is necessary and only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural to re-interpret texts in their original historical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social context, replacing them with more contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations that are more humanistic and developed, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping the content of the verses stable.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On 5 August 1996,  Dr Nasr Hamed Abu-Zeid was ordered to divorce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from his wife after being branded an apostate by the Court of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cassation. The court  confirmed a decision by the Cairo Court
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Appeals in June 1995 where the verdict stated:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The court announces the separation of the first defendant [Dr
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Abu-Zeid] from his wife, the second defendant, because of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; former's apostasy and because she is a Muslim. And the court calls
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the first defendant to repent to God Almighty and to return to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Islamic religion which was brought as a light to the people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being them happiness in this world and the hereafter.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He is now living in exile with his wife in The Netherlands.
</em><br>
<p>Amara, you were reading my mind (or maybe just some of the same books I've
<br>
been reading :-)  I was thinking of Nasr's case when I was reading the posts
<br>
from last night and this morning over my first cup of coffee this morning.
<br>
I pretty much agree with you 100% here.  Damien's right that there's
<br>
religiously-motivated violence that comes from basically all of the world's
<br>
religions, but religious violence isn't equally distributed -- there's just
<br>
no question that more of it comes from the Islamic world.
<br>
<p>A vignette: My wife's teenage cousing spent a few week with us this summer.
<br>
One day he was sitting at my computer in my study at home and he gestured to
<br>
the bookshelves around him and said, &quot;You sure have a lot of books in here
<br>
about religion.  Seems weird for an atheist.&quot;  I responded: &quot;Don't doctors
<br>
have lots of books about disease?  It doesn't mean they're sick.&quot;
<br>
<p>Snapshot: Anyone questioning the virulently reactionary nature of the
<br>
Wahhabist brand of Islam motivating the Islamofascists might want to take a
<br>
look at this and follow and explore the links it leads to:
