<p>I'm skeptical.  Humanity has too much potential to modify the
<br>
environment given its current biotechnological or future
<br>
nanotechnological skills.  Evolving to a phase state where
<br>
there are fewer humans?  Perhaps.  Evolving to a phase state
<br>
where most humans are uploaded?  Sure.  Devolving rather than
<br>
manipulating the environment?  I don't think so.  The survival
<br>
instinct is too strong.
<br>
<p>Does raise an interesting perspective with regard to the Fermi
<br>
Paradox though.  If you *know*, and I mean *really* know, that the
<br>
universe is doomed to collapse or expand/decay into nothingness --
<br>
does that eventually (on relatively short time scales relative
<br>
to the age of the universe) sap the will of a species to survive?
<br>
<p>I've argued in the past that there is no interstellar &quot;colonization&quot;
<br>
drive because it is pointless.  It can be pointless because there is
<br>
no benefit to oneself (and in fact involves a significant sacrifice --
<br>
leaving behind the knowledge/culture of an advanced civilization).
<br>
It can be pointless because one potentially creates future competitors
<br>
for what remains of the resources in the universe.  Or finally it
<br>
can be pointless because one concludes there really is no way out.
<br>
<p>On the anniversary of 911, I watched a program on the PBS program
<br>
&quot;American Experience&quot;, which contained a minute or two of video
<br>
footage of people hurling themselves out of the burning towers
<br>
because there was no other &quot;way out&quot;.  How would a species react
<br>
if it ultimately concluded there was no &quot;way out&quot;?
