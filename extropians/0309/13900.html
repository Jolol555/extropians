</em><br>
<p>This is based on Karl Schroeder's _Permancence_. Some idea spoilers:
<br>
<p>Schroeder's argument is based on that it is the ability to change the 
<br>
environment and ourselves that is the problem. Intelligence arises, he 
<br>
suggests, because a species has no particular adaptations making it 
<br>
suided for the environment it finds itself in. So instead it develops 
<br>
intelligence enabling it to at first succeed better in the environment 
<br>
and then to change the environment to suit itself - first locally, the  
<br>
globally as it becomes more powerful. Eventually it becomes able to 
<br>
change environments and itself in arbitrary ways. It is at this point it 
<br>
will remove all discrepancy between itself and its environment. The 
<br>
species is perfectly adapted to its world, and there is no pressure for 
<br>
more intelligence. In fact, as long as the now artificial environment 
<br>
and the species change together they can &quot;devolve&quot; quietly into a 
<br>
non-intelligent form, which is the ultimately stable state.
<br>
<p>Schroeder's argument is a long-range argument. In his novel he mentions 
<br>
that several species appears to have built galaxy-spanning empires and 
<br>
gone post-alien in the past, but eventually (sometimes after fairly long 
<br>
periods) all ended up in the above non-intelligent state. His point is 
<br>
that over truly long spans of time it might be nearly impossible for 
<br>
civilizations to escape this kind of evolutionary attractors. In his 
<br>
novel there are two species that have tried, with some mixed success. 
<br>
One is called the Chicxulub...
<br>
<p>I personally don't think his argument is true, but it is interesting. It 
<br>
leaves out the fact that a diverse civilization will always have some 
<br>
individuals creating offshoots even if the main trunk is fossilizing, 
<br>
and it ignores that the social environment created by other people is 
<br>
far more complex than any natural environment and co-evolves strongly 
<br>
with the species. I don't think &quot;will to live&quot; works as an argument, 
<br>
though. 
<br>
<p>BTW, Schroeder has some interesting criticism of the singularity and new
<br>
worldtypes on his blog <a href="http://www.kschroeder.com/">http://www.kschroeder.com/</a> - there are some
<br>
interesting ideas there. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Does raise an interesting perspective with regard to the Fermi
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paradox though.  If you *know*, and I mean *really* know, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe is doomed to collapse or expand/decay into nothingness --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does that eventually (on relatively short time scales relative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the age of the universe) sap the will of a species to survive?
</em><br>
<p>_Permanence_ has a somewhat similar situation; there it seems clear that
<br>
the universe is in a long-term steady state situation (either a real
<br>
steady state or chaotic inflation, I forget which) and that intelligence
<br>
does not last. So what motivates people to do longterm stuff? I think
<br>
the answer for the protagonist is a bit simplistic, essentially
<br>
Nietzsche's dictum that one should live every moment to the fullest
<br>
since it will recur an infinite number of times, but that might serve to
<br>
amplify a long-term ambition (I love doing long-term stuff, hence I
<br>
should be doing it). 
<br>
<p>I think a real answer to your question would be more diverse. Different 
<br>
people and species will have different answers. The idea that something 
<br>
that ultimately ends thus is pointless is a culturally particular 
<br>
construction. One can easily imagine cultures that see something good in 
<br>
finitude, for example. And again, if a species is relatively diverse 
<br>
there will be individuals with sufficiently unusual ideas to go on.
<br>
<p>This actually undermines the anti-colonization argument, since there
<br>
would always be a few individuals of each supercivilization (and that
<br>
can be quite a few) that would consider running away and starting their
<br>
own new civilization to be great. That would produce a new wave of 
<br>
civilizations, that in turn would produce daughters. The Robins scenario 
<br>
would start.
