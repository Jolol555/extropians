<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; one controls all that land and all

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; those people, but is all screwed up.  The other is

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; free and prosperous.  It's a lesson a six year old

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;its independent history and that its first general elections were in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;1996, by which time it was already prosperous relative to its

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, another beautiful theory slain by an ugly fact.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Lets not forget the separation of political and economic systems.
<br>
Democracy is the political structure, communism refers to both a
<br>
political one *and* an economic one, democracy has no implications of
<br>
economic structure.  You can have free market democracies or heavily
<br>
socialized ones.  Tawain may have been under martial law, but it was
<br>
also a market based economy with a rule of law not present in China, and
<br>
history clearly shows that whether democratic or totalitarian, market
<br>
based economies clearly produce higher standards of living for the
<br>
people that live under them, providing adequate rule of law.
<br>
<p>Article on the subject -
<br>
www.worldbank.org/research/growth/pdfiles/dollarkraay2.pdf 
<br>
<p>Subject: David Dollar and Aart Kraay - Property Rights, Political
<br>
Rights, and the development of Poor countries
<br>
<p>David Dollar and Aart Kraay - Property Rights, Political Rights, and the
<br>
development of Poor countries 
<br>
This is An interesting paper relating economic growth and world policy.
<br>
Specifically relating to finding out what behavior objectively leads to
<br>
a better standard of living for the worlds population and the world's
<br>
poor. 
<br>
<p>The Author first designates two main criteria to the paper, defining
<br>
government structures in 'voice' and 'rule of law' Voice refers to the
<br>
say the populace has in the government, and the 'rule of law' refers to
<br>
the general trust and abidence in law of the people of the nation.
<br>
Similiar to two catagories I have often used as democratic vs non
<br>
democratic and despotic vs non despotic. The Author points out that all
<br>
developed nations rank high in both 'rule of law' and 'voice',yet poor
<br>
countries (especially the sixty poorest) rank very low in both
<br>
catagories (The ranking is based on a series of quantifiable and
<br>
qualifiable variables and averaged out, defined in the paper) Notably,
<br>
the author points out that the rule of law has a very powerful effect on
<br>
the income of the poor, that is, the more the populace and the
<br>
governance respects the laws the better off the people are, especially
<br>
the poorest. The author notes that (not surprisingly to me) that
<br>
democracy does not have as strong of a correlation to helping the poor
<br>
as the non-despotic vs. despotic 'rule of law' catagorization does.
<br>
Nations can not prosper if laws are not in place or enforced. The good
<br>
voice poor law countries do not fare well, while the good law poor voice
<br>
did fare much better for the poor. Of course the good law good voice was
<br>
at the top, (on average) while poor voice poor law was at the bottom.
<br>
Unfortunately, as the author notes, the good voice poor law gets about
<br>
twice as much aid as the good law poor voice countries, something that
<br>
is not as conducive to ending poverty as the reverse situation. The
<br>
author suggests that more aide should be given to countries that have
<br>
reasonably good economic practices and respect of law. 
<br>
<p>Furthermore, the author notes that countries with relatively good rule
<br>
of law, even in the absence of good voice (such as China, Uganda, Ghana,
<br>
and Vietnam) which are well known market oriented reformers in the past
<br>
15 years, are seeing income rise rapidly and education and literacy
<br>
expanding . The Author notes that these trends may lead to greater
<br>
political liberalization (good voice) much like Chile, Taiwan, or South
<br>
Korea. 
<br>
<p>The author qualitatively defines 'Rule of Law' as the measure of the
<br>
extent to which people have confidence in and abide by the rules of
<br>
society. He quantitatively defines it with a series of measurable
<br>
variables in the paper. This concept definately is an excellent
<br>
description of what exactly is lacking in post communist russia and the
<br>
reason for its current conditions. 
<br>
<p>Interestingly, the Author notes that as we move from the poles to the
<br>
tropics, both good voice and rule of law decline. An enrvironmental /
<br>
social reason for this is releayed in Jared Diamonds &quot;Guns, Germs and
<br>
Steel&quot; A quick summary for the pattern is given in this paper. 
<br>
<p>The author argues that when we ask what countries have good governments
<br>
when handing out foriegn aide, the most important factor is whether the
<br>
country and its people support a rule of law, and second to that is a
<br>
good political voice. 
<br>
<p>The author also notes that there is a tight link between income of the
<br>
poor and per capita income and there is a relationship between the
<br>
growth rate of income of the poor and median income. Obvious for persons
<br>
familiar with averages (mean, mode, median) He also states that the
<br>
evidence is clear that openness to foriegn trade and investment will
<br>
accelerate growth and poverty reduction.
