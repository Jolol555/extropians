<p>I believe what is going on is that there are certain SPAMers
<br>
out there that are sending out virus infected emails with forged
<br>
but none-the-less valid email addresses.  There are various SPAM
<br>
filters that detect the email is infected, purge the infection,
<br>
then send a note to the forged email address that they are sending
<br>
out virus infected emails as a &quot;service&quot;.
<br>
<p>I believe these filters are not correctly determing whether or not
<br>
the email originated from a system which the forged email address
<br>
would &quot;probably&quot; have come from.  This is difficult now, because
<br>
there may be millions of virus infected computers that may be
<br>
infected and corrupted into being what is known as an &quot;open relay&quot;.
<br>
<p>So sometimes the response that the email was infected is helpful
<br>
and sometimes it means absolutely nothing.
<br>
<p>This may be in response to the fact that I think the &quot;free&quot; email
<br>
providers (e.g. yahoo, hotmail, etc.) have become somewhat more
<br>
clever about requirements that one must use to open a new &quot;free&quot;
<br>
account, making it very difficult for an automated program to
<br>
open a valid email account so it has a valid Email &quot;return&quot;
<br>
address.  Said providers seem to have also become very aggressive
<br>
about detecting and deleting these Email &quot;return&quot; addresses as soon
<br>
as it becomes clear that they are being used for spamming purposes.
<br>
So the old &quot;free&quot; email accounts with valid return addresses
<br>
have increasingly shorter lifetimes.
<br>
<p>I've noticed in my system debug logs a significant increase in
<br>
tests for random addresses, e.g. <a href="mailto:xyzzy@aeiveos.com?Subject=Re:%20SPAM%20[was:%20Somebody%20here%20may%20have%20the%20Sobig%20virus...]">xyzzy@aeiveos.com</a> -- suggesting
<br>
to me that the SPAMers are simply making up names within valid
<br>
domains to either test for valid return addresses or trying to
<br>
get through email delivery systems that don't follow the requirement
<br>
to test and make sure the return address is valid.
<br>
<p>But it makes sense -- if the SPAMers have 40 million addresses,
<br>
and many delivery programs require that the return address be
<br>
valid, and they have devised a system of open relays, then one
<br>
is going to get cases of the random generation of emails from
<br>
any one of those addresses to another of those addresses.
<br>
<p>Also, if you think its going to get worse -- believe it.

based on:

<br>
<p>Universities are having to take their entire local networks off
<br>
the internet as students start coming to school with infected machines
<br>
to make an attempt to purge their systems of the viruses.
<br>
<p>Spambouncer has worked reasonably well for me thus far but I'm
<br>
soon going to have to upgrade to put a Bayesian filter on top
<br>
of that.
<br>
<p>If you want an idea of how bad it is -- I seem to have ~31+ MEGABYTES(!)
<br>
of filtered SPAM/BULK email over the last 9 days (~3.5 MEGABYTES/day).
<br>
There is no way anyone can wade through all of that to determine how
<br>
many false positives there might be.
