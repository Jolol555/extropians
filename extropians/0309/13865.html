<em>&gt;The only thing of value is personal time.  In such exchanges, all are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;zero-sum.
</em><br>
<p>So if I trade one hour of my time, as my skill as a welder say, for one
<br>
hour of your time, as your skill as a carpenter, who loses and who wins?
<br>
If it is zero sum, there must be a winner and a loser.  Are you a loser
<br>
merely because I would not do the welding for no trade whatsoever?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Does the Earth have a limited amount of Wealth?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The earth itself has no wealth.  Only the people on it have wealth and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have it by virtue of their effort.
</em><br>
<p>Effort?  As in what, physical labor?  Calories expended?  What about
<br>
people who sit in front of a computer all day processing information,
<br>
turning not so valuable information into more valuable information.  Is
<br>
there a limit to the value that can be imparted unto information?  As a
<br>
different example, every kilogram of gasoline contains within it 12,000
<br>
Watts for an hour.  That's about 16 Horsepower, or say about 32 people
<br>
power per hour.  Oxidizing one kilogram of petrol is the same as having
<br>
32 strong youthfull slaves at your beck and call for one full hour.
<br>
Whose effort are you using?  You can do the work that previously took 32
<br>
people to do.  In fact, modern farmers in post-industrialized nations do
<br>
the work of 100 workers at the turn of the century.  That's *one*
<br>
farmer.  His 'effort' is 100 times more productive than it would have
<br>
been a century before.  Does this not demonstrate that 'effort' as
<br>
directed through technology has no limit to its value?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Last I checked, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; werent running out of Food or Energy, since we have more of both now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than ever in the entire history of humanity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And we destroy more of it now than any time in human history in order 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to keep our &quot;supply and demand&quot; theory going.  
</em><br>
<p>Not sure what exactly you mean by keeping our &quot;supply and demand&quot; theory
<br>
going, especially when you quoted 
<br>
[<a href="http://www.maketradefair.org/stylesheet.asp?file=03042002121618&amp;cat=2&amp;s">http://www.maketradefair.org/stylesheet.asp?file=03042002121618&amp;cat=2&amp;s</a>òk¿<br>
ubcat=6&amp;select=1] in your previous post which said &quot;The international
<br>
community has failed to address the problem of low and unstable
<br>
commodity prices, which consign millions of people to poverty. Coffee
<br>
prices, for example, have fallen by 70 per cent since 1997&quot;  How do you
<br>
propose keeping Coffee prices at the original level *without* dumping
<br>
some significant amount of Coffee into the ocean?  How is 'addressing
<br>
unstable commodity prices' any different than keeping up &quot;supply and
<br>
demand&quot; theories?  
<br>
<p>After all, if what you 
<br>
<em>&gt;said above were true, I wouldn't be paying $8.95 for a BLT in Westwood 
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  If you can make a BLT cheaper, start your own BLT joint.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not a communist - peaceful anarchist (like a libertarian who doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think that governments should prop-up corporations or monetary systems 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;any more than they should subsidize pork-bellies).
</em><br>
<p>Ok, your libertarian descriptions fit me as well, yet I certainly
<br>
wouldn't call myself a 'peacefull anarchist' (how do you propose it
<br>
remain 'peacefull' anarchy, btw?) I despise corporate subsidy and the
<br>
general interference of the market by rediculous government intrusion.
<br>
But I would like to hear more of what kind of system you would propose.
<br>
I often mull over questions of moral state's and perfect societies.
<br>
Does your peacefull Anarchist society have property rights?  Who
<br>
enforces them?  What if I, as an intelligent reasonable person plan
<br>
aheard for foul weather by storing extra food, yet my neighboors, who I
<br>
warned of foul weather, did not head my advice and are no starving.  Do
<br>
they have a right to take my provisions?  Who forces the Doctor to treat
<br>
my ailments to achieve 'adequate' health care?  Especially If I can not
<br>
pay him, and no government exists to coerce him.  Shall my best friend
<br>
just hold a gun to his head?  (Oh, right, you said a 'peacefull
<br>
anrachist', I suppose Ill just ask him politely to perform required
<br>
operation)  Truthfully, I don't understand how this system could
<br>
possibly exist, unless each and every person in it is immortal,
<br>
perpetually healthy, and always with shelter and food.  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Marx was an anarchist too, BTW.  The difference is one of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;methodology/praxis.  The anarchist desires to immediately dissolve the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government.  The Communist wishes to put up a temporary government in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;order to advance to a state of anarchy later by that means.
</em><br>
<p>Is that so?  I guess most communist governements just never got to sit
<br>
around long enough to turn into full anarachies.  
<br>
<p>How does peaceful anarachy alleviate global poverty?  (food, shelter,
<br>
and adequate health care)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The way I 
<br>
<em>&gt;see it, communism as a methodology has demonstrated itself to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inadequate for achieving the goal which is the simple removal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of forced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alienation of our labor.
</em><br>
<p>'Inadequate'?  That's an understatement if I have ever heard one,
<br>
considering it is responsible for 170 million deaths this century.  What
<br>
is 'forced alienation of our labor' and what about volunteer labor.  I
<br>
also note, we can not exist without labor, we must labor for our food.
<br>
How is that dichotomy settled?  Food will not fall from the sky and into
<br>
your mouth, and with no government to provide it, where will it come
<br>
from?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If you don't think the alienation of your labor is forced - stop paying
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;taxes and wait.
</em><br>
<p>And where is where my understanding has serious gaps.  I don't
<br>
understand 'alienation' used in this context.  Can you elaborate on
<br>
this?  I have no doubt my labor is forced.  If I chose to stop working,
<br>
I would lose my house.  But if I just chose to sit around somewhere, I
<br>
would starve to death.  Who is the unlucky fellow forced to feed me so I
<br>
will not be forced into labor?
<br>
<p>I just cant envision a manifestation of this society you talk about.  Do
<br>
you work?  Do you grow food?  Do you sit around all day and chew peyote
<br>
buttons?  Do you exchange efforts for other peoples efforts?  How do you
<br>
exchange it?  Is the effort of a rock thrower equal in value to the
<br>
effort of a brain surgeon?  How do you contend with the variations in
<br>
the value of peoples abilities and efforts?  I have little need for rock
<br>
throwers, but need computer programmers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is no good form of government.  Government is essentially an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;alienation of rights from the individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, tentatively.  But are some governments 'less bad' than others?
<br>
Say, for example, Pol Pot's Cambodia vs. Australia?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Maybe one of those ingorant peasant farmers will bring about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; singularity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do I have to want the singularity in order to want to live much longer?
</em><br>
<p>No, but I don't see how any of the ideas you propose would make it
<br>
objectively make it likely that you would live any longer.  Though I
<br>
would certainly entertain any evidence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; As Gorby pointed out in the late 80's, Singapore generated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more wealth 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; than the ENTIRE Soviet Union.  But it must have been because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it was exploiting the working man, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Without any doubt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Did the people of singapore live better lives than the people of the
<br>
soviet union?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
