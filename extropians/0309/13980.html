</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My point is simply this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Modern concepts of causation are not deterministic.
</em><br>
<p>Well, my understanding is that cancer is a class of multi-causal
<br>
diseases.  In general, it seems that two gene mutations are necessary to
<br>
cause any given cancer: one in an oncogene, the other in a tumor
<br>
suppressor gene.  There are a variety of factors that can cause either,
<br>
including inheritence, behavior, environmental factors (presence of
<br>
carcinogens), and infectious agents (e.g., H. pylori seems to be
<br>
implicated in stomach cancer).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In our current understanding of the causes of cancer,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both age and toxins are factors.   On this I think we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree.  Take away the toxins - who knows.  Take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away the age - who knows.  After that it's ALL
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conjecture.
</em><br>
<p>To some extent, yes, but as others have pointed out it's nearly
<br>
impossible to remove all toxins AND I think Robert pointed out that a
<br>
certain amount of toxic stress might actually be good for the body
<br>
because it ramps up defense mechanisms.
<br>
<p>Also, I would point out that two other things I didn't see mentioned in
<br>
this discussion -- or I missed them, so forgive me for echoing someone
<br>
else's words unwittingly.  One is that carcinogens are both human-made
<br>
and non-human made.  So merely saying reductions in human-made
<br>
pollutants (&quot;pollutants&quot; already being kind of a subjective term; to me,
<br>
burning incense in my domicile would be considered polluting it, while
<br>
many of my friends love doing that in theirs) would reduce cancer, this
<br>
leaves alone increases in natural ones.
<br>
<p>The other is that diagnostic capabilities have increased over time.  So,
<br>
it's possible that cancer rates might have been under-reported in the
<br>
past.  If, say, someone who was poor died in India in 1800 CE or even
<br>
BCE at the age of 70, would anyone have know what caused her death?
<br>
Yeah, if there was a big cancerous lesion on her tongue, maybe.
<br>
<p>Also, people have perhaps become too paranoid about these things.  I
<br>
have a close friend who won't take dental X-rays because he fears
<br>
getting cancer.  Now I don't know the statistical correlation between
<br>
dental X-rays and cancers, but the funny thing is neither does he!:@
<br>
So, he's basically just making an emotional choice here -- which might
<br>
cost him.  (How?  Well, a dental X-ray might identify certain mouth
<br>
problems that can be easily corrected.  Some of these actually might be
<br>
cofactors in causing heart disease and even cancers.)
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
