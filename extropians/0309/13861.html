<p>The only thing of value is personal time.  In such exchanges, all are

zero-sum.

<p><em>&gt; Does the Earth have a limited amount of Wealth?

<p>The earth itself has no wealth.  Only the people on it have wealth and 
<br>
they have it by virtue of their effort.

<p><em>&gt; Last I checked, we

<p>And we destroy more of it now than any time in human history in order 
<br>
to keep our &quot;supply and demand&quot; theory going.  After all, if what you 
<br>
said above were true, I wouldn't be paying $8.95 for a BLT in Westwood 
<br>
&quot;If there were an efficient market&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, and so many extropian list members thought there were no communists

</em><br>
<p>Not a communist - peaceful anarchist (like a libertarian who doesn't 
<br>
think that governments should prop-up corporations or monetary systems 
<br>
any more than they should subsidize pork-bellies).
<br>
<p>Marx was an anarchist too, BTW.  The difference is one of 
<br>
methodology/praxis.  The anarchist desires to immediately dissolve the 
<br>
government.  The Communist wishes to put up a temporary government in 
<br>
order to advance to a state of anarchy later by that means.  The way I 
<br>
see it, communism as a methodology has demonstrated itself to be 
<br>
inadequate for achieving the goal which is the simple removal of forced 
<br>
alienation of our labor.
<br>
<p>If you don't think the alienation of your labor is forced - stop paying 
<br>
taxes and wait.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  NO FORM OF GOVERNMENT that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is farther from extropian as communist ones have been.
</em><br>
<p>There is no good form of government.  Government is essentially an 
<br>
alienation of rights from the individual.
<br>
<p>&quot;The only good government is a dissolved government.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  But alas, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure you are holding out for that perfect extropian communist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eh?
</em><br>
<p>Nope.  Much too cynical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe one of those ingorant peasant farmers will bring about the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Do I have to want the singularity in order to want to live much longer?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As Gorby pointed out in the late 80's, Singapore generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more wealth than the ENTIRE Soviet Union.  But it must have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was exploiting the working man, right?
</em><br>
<p>Without any doubt.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
