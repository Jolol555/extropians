</em><br>
<p>I didn't use the term &quot;disembodied brain&quot; but that's a fair way
<br>
of putting it. I had in mind any hyper general intelligence that
<br>
has been artificially produced. An intelligence that was non 
<br>
biological and would not be considered a legal person in any
<br>
existing jurisdiction, therefore could not vote, run for elected 
<br>
office or perhaps own property in its own right. 
<br>
<p>I cannot imagine any circumstance where the first artificial 
<br>
super intelligence would not either emerge as a distributed 
<br>
phenomenon, or grow from some sort of seed AI under the
<br>
guidance of some human person or group of persons. 
<br>
<p>My question is therefore if such a non biological general hyper
<br>
intelligence suddenly appeared on the world stage as a 
<br>
phenomenon who would submit to its authority (given it is 
<br>
not a person and has not the right to run for office etc)
<br>
or trust that it was benevolent (even if it was) when it had
<br>
either been developed by others or had emerged itself?
<br>
<p>I for one would have serious difficulties taking on face 
<br>
value that such an entity should be submitted to merely
<br>
because it was of higher intelligence by most peoples 
<br>
reckoning. I'd have reservations as to who its real masters
<br>
and what its real goals might be. 
<br>
<p>I suspect the general AI would not be able to exert power
<br>
directly but only through human proxies and these proxies 
<br>
would themselves be distrusted by some and have difficulty
<br>
getting to a point where they could operate as figurehead
<br>
for in any benevolent dictatorship.
<br>
<p>Could be the only way a hyper intelligent AI can kick start
<br>
a rapid take off singularity is against the wishes of a majority
<br>
of voters. i.e. by brute military and or economic force and
<br>
through human proxies. That was my thought anyway.
<br>
<p>Do others see a problem with this reasoning or conclusion?
<br>
