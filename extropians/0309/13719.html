<p>Robert Zubrin had some things to say on this subject in his book
<br>
&quot;Entering Space&quot;  Skylab had more liveable area than the ISS does and
<br>
was made from the third stage of the Saturn V, it was originally the
<br>
fuel tanks for the moon mission.

<p>Political impacts on the US space program
<br>
&quot;The attempt to cope with these economic realities underlies much of the
<br>
pathology associated with the Shuttle program for the past twenty years.
<br>
For example, in selling the Shuttle program to Congress during the
<br>
1970's, NASA officials claimed that the Shuttle would fly forty times
<br>
per year (one launch every nine days!). This prediction should have
<br>
aroused skepticism on two grounds: (a) the technical difficult in
<br>
preparing a Shuttle for launch in so short a time and (b) the lack of a
<br>
payload manifest large enough to such a launch rate. NASA leaders left
<br>
(a) up to the engineers to solve as best they could, but attempted to
<br>
solve (b) themselves through political action. Specifically, the NASA
<br>
brass in the late 1970's abd tge early 1980's obtained agreements from
<br>
the White House to the effect that once the Shuttle became fully
<br>
operational, all U.S. government payloads would be launched on the
<br>
Shuttle. That is, NASA wanted to the expendable Deltas, Atlases, and
<br>
Titans phased out of existence so that the Shuttle could enjoy a bigger
<br>
manifest and have its economics improve accordingly. The Air Force
<br>
resisted this policy, as they feared that a Shuttle accident could cause
<br>
a stand-down of the entire program, which would them make it impossible
<br>
to launch vital military reconnaissance and communication satellites
<br>
when required. It seems incredible today, but the NASA argument actually
<br>
carried the day against the Air Force in Washington's corridors of
<br>
power. During the 1980's, the expendable &quot;mixed fleet&quot; was in the
<br>
process of being phased out. It was only after the Challenger disaster
<br>
in January 1986 proved the Air Force concerns were fully justified that
<br>
President Reagan reversed the decision.&quot; 
<br>

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;---------
<br>
<p>Politics and the International Space Station (idealogical driven
<br>
scientific goals) 
<br>
&quot;The need to increase the launch manifest to justify Shuttle economics
<br>
played a central role in the decision to initiate the Space Station
<br>
program. In the early 1980s, NASA Deputy Administrator Hans Mark saw
<br>
clearly that achieving a shuttle launch rate of twenty-five per year
<br>
would be impossible without the manifest created by the construction and
<br>
supply needs of a permanently orbiting outpost, which he already
<br>
supported as a facility for in space scientific research (mark did not
<br>
believe the forty launches per year touted by earlier shuttle advocates
<br>
was feasible under any conditions). Based on this (probably accurate
<br>
assessment), Mark convinced first NASA Administrator James Beggs and
<br>
then the Reagan White House of the need for a space station program. The
<br>
need to generate a large shuttle manifest also helps to explain the
<br>
bizarre nature of the engineering designs that have guided the space
<br>
station program since its inceptions.
<br>
<p>The right way to build a Space Station is to build a heavy-lift launch
<br>
vehicle and use it to launch the station in a single piece. The United
<br>
States launched the Skylab space station in this manner in 1973. Skylab,
<br>
which contained more living space than the currently planned
<br>
International Space Station (ISS), was built in one piece and launched
<br>
in a single day. AS a result, the entire Skylab program, end to end from
<br>
1968 to 1974, including development, build, launch, and operation was
<br>
conducted at a cost in today's money of about $4 Billion, roughly
<br>
one-eighth of the anticipated cost of the ISS. In contrast, the Space
<br>
Station has gone through numerous designs (of which the current ISS is
<br>
the latest), all of which called for over thirty Shuttle Launches, each
<br>
delivering an element that would be added into an extended ticky-tacky
<br>
structure on orbit. Since no one really knows how to do this, such an
<br>
approach has caused the program development cost and schedule to
<br>
explode. In 1993, the recently appointed NASA Administrator Dan Goldin
<br>
attempted to deal with this situation be ordering a total reassessment
<br>
of the Space Station's design. Three teams, labeled A, B, and C, were
<br>
assigned to develop complete designs for three distinct Space Station
<br>
concepts. Teams A and B took two somewhat different approaches to the by
<br>
then standard thirty-Shuttle-launch/orbit assembly concept, whereas team
<br>
C developed a Skylab-type design that would be launched in a single
<br>
throw of a heave lift vehicle (a &quot;Shuttle C&quot; consisting of the Shuttle
<br>
launch stack but without the reusable orbiter). The three approaches
<br>
were then submitted to a blue ribbon panel organized by the
<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology for competitive judgment. The
<br>
M.I.T. panel ruled decisively in favor of option C (a fact that
<br>
demonstrated only their common sense, not their brilliance, as C was
<br>
much cheaper, simpler, safer, more reliable, and more capable and would
<br>
have given the nation a heavy-lift launcher as a bonus). However, based
<br>
on the need to create Shuttle Launches as well as a desire to have the
<br>
Space Station design that would allow modular additions by international
<br>
partners, Vice President Al Gore and House Space Subcommittee chairman
<br>
George Brown overruled the M.I.T. panel. By political fiat, these
<br>
gentlemen forced NASA to accept option A, and thee space agency has had
<br>
to struggle with the task of building the Space Station on that basis
<br>
ever since. The result has been a further set of cost and schedule
<br>
overruns, the blame for which has been consistently placed on various
<br>
NASA middle managers instead of those really responsible.&quot;
