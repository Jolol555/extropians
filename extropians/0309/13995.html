<p>Understood.  This was my incorrect extension of the direction in
<br>
which I thought you were taking things.
<br>
<p>*But* there are cost-benefit tradeoffs.  If we simply take asbestos
<br>
(as perhaps a bad example) -- I've never seen any analysis of how
<br>
many cases of cancer (or deaths) it may have caused vs. how many
<br>
lives it may have saved (reduced numbers of fires, slower burn
<br>
times allowing greater opportunities to escape, etc.).  One could
<br>
do a similar analysis with the analysis of reductions of pollutants
<br>
in water supplies -- but one has to balance this with increased
<br>
costs of water supplies that might prevent parents from providing
<br>
their children with proper nutrition.  One sees the debate perhaps
<br>
most with so-called &quot;organic&quot; food.  Producing organic food is
<br>
in many cases less productive than using historic agricultural
<br>
methods that may involve the use of pesticides.  Result -- the
<br>
food is more expensive.  So I can buy organic produce but I
<br>
may not be able to afford a car with side impact air bags.
<br>
<p>If one is being rational about this one has to think about the
<br>
tradeoffs.  There is a very big question as to whether we have
<br>
already driven the requirements (in the U.S.) for minimal exposure
<br>
to carcinogens so low that in most cases the costs significantly
<br>
exceed the benefits.  There is still a big debate that current
<br>
carcinogen exposure standards are extrapolated from very high dose
<br>
exposures and that because of the way DNA repair regulation works
<br>
there may be minimal danger from low dose exposures.
<br>
<p>The rules are also inconsistent.  Though we *know* that natural
<br>
radon exposure in a number of areas is responsible for a significant
<br>
fraction of lung cancers -- there are not any mandated laws requiring
<br>
those houses be destroyed.  You also don't see laws saying one cannot
<br>
build homes above certain altitudes due to increased cosmic ray
<br>
exposure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nor did I ever say that &quot;all persons are created (immunologically)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equal&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  This was my pointing out that there may not be universal
<br>
solutions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm talking about OBVIOUS things like dumping heavy metals and known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poisons into water supplies, storing radioactive waste near humans,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; billowing smog into the air second after-second, etc.
</em><br>
<p>In the U.S. the water standards are very strict.  I get a report every
<br>
year from the city of Seattle with the results of their continual
<br>
analysis of the water.  People who have individual wells and who have
<br>
to deal with the content of the groundwater are perhaps at greater risk.
<br>
Low level exposure to radioactive waste may actually be beneficial for
<br>
the DNA repair activation reasons I have outlined.  The risk of the
<br>
theft of such material for its use in a dirty bomb is probably a much
<br>
greater risk at this time.  The primary sources of smog at this
<br>
time are probably automobiles and coal power plants.  In these cases
<br>
I would tend to agree that a little bit more economic and political
<br>
pressure might result in improvements.  But we (in the U.S.) have
<br>
significantly improved things from the decades where high quantities
<br>
of acid rain were poisoning our lakes.  The real populations at risk
<br>
are in the 3rd world countries where environmental quality standards
<br>
are much lower than those in the U.S.  Here one does see the air pollution
<br>
standards in California slowly turning the screws on the automobile
<br>
manufacturers.  So the big remaining problem would appear to be G.B.
<br>
attempting to relax regulations on the coal power plants -- but the states
<br>
in New England are taking him to court on that one I believe.
<br>
<p>So overall I think things are not as bad as they may appear at first
<br>
glance.
<br>
