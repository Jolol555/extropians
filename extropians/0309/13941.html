</em><br>
<p>Like hell they are not (deterministic) -- its pretty clear at this point
<br>
if you have certain mutations in the p53 gene (or a number of other tumor
<br>
suppressor genes) they will become nonfunctional and you will likely
<br>
develop cancer at some point.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   On this I think we all agree.  Take away the toxins - who knows.  Take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away the age - who knows.  After that it's ALL conjecture.
</em><br>
<p>As has been noted, some low level of toxins may be helpful.  Taking
<br>
them away entirely could be quite harmful.  Whether this will be the
<br>
case depends on individual genetic makeup.  So while it may be a
<br>
&quot;who knows&quot; situation now because we cannot genotype every single
<br>
individual affordably -- it will *not* be a &quot;who knows&quot; situation
<br>
in the future when we have that technological capability.  The
<br>
bottom line will be that toxins are harmful to some -- but not others.
<br>
<p>With respect to &quot;age&quot; it is the same problem -- you either have
<br>
a genotype that allows one to be susceptible to cancer or one
<br>
does not.  Human cells accumulate mutations in the genetic
<br>
program over time.  Thus the longer one has lived the greater
<br>
the chances that one has accumulated mutations that will cause
<br>
cells to become cancerous.  Thus age is linked to cancer.  The
<br>
people who don't get cancer may simply be thankful that they
<br>
die (perhaps prematurely) from some other defect in their genetic
<br>
program (or an accident).
<br>
<p>Cancer is a process in which genomes become corrupted so that cells
<br>
do not behave as the initial genome design dictated.  Some of that
<br>
may be caused by toxin exposure and some of that may simply be caused
<br>
by &quot;living&quot; (e.g. free radical damage caused by normal oxidative
<br>
metabolism).  Which is more important is not &quot;conjecture&quot; -- it
<br>
is a combination of environment and genetics.  And there is reasonably
<br>
solid data on how different aspects of these bias ones risks.
<br>
(For example living in a home with high radon levels definitely
<br>
slants one towards cancer -- not &quot;conjecture&quot;.  But at the same
<br>
time not everyone gets cancer and this comes down to genetic
<br>
predispositions.)
