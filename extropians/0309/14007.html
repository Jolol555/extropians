<p><em>&gt; It has to be said, watching the evolution of these things is fascinating.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's the scrabbling lizards on a glass wall stage; lots of momentum and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action, but not much purchase yet in the climb to something truly new. I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fairly sure there's something very cool, transforming and radically new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hiding somewhere in this whole six degrees and networking service thing, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it remains to be seen what that actually might be.
</em><br>
<p>One of the issues is that many would consider it impolite to be included 
<br>
in someone else's network w/o their permission or knowledge. There are 
<br>
some ways around that.
<br>
<p>I see aggregators as a social singularity precursor. Especially when 
<br>
most folks have wearables with always-on internet connections. I see 
<br>
such a human-centered singularity as possibly quite more desirable than 
<br>
a technological singularity obtained thru nanotech and/or friendly AI. 
<br>
In any case it might better prepare us for such advances.
<br>
<p>Part of it boils down to, what do I want, and what do I have to trade. 
<br>
Remember that comedy plot, used more than once in M*A*S*H, where the 
<br>
folks need some part, and the only place to get it is thru someone who 
<br>
won't trade it except for what he wants. During course of the show they 
<br>
produced a Rube Goldberg-esque multipart trade. With aggreators, it 
<br>
seems possible that such could be accomplished almost automatically, and 
<br>
on a world-wide scale.
<br>
<p>Another possible application would be stranger identification. In any 
<br>
community crowd, you won't know everybody, but chances are that someone 
<br>
in the crowd will know someone that you don't. Those unknown by anyone 
<br>
in the crowd could be quickly identified by aggregating the crowd's 
<br>
collective identifications. This doesn't mean they would be a criminal, 
<br>
but in certain high-risk areas they might be stopped and checked for 
<br>
bombs or something.
