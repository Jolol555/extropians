<p>Ah, but as the saying goes, &quot;there's the rub&quot;.  I don't have any problem
<br>
with the removal of mutagenic substances generally deemed universally
<br>
harmful.  Asbestos might be a good example.  But with many other toxic
<br>
substances the level to which one &quot;should&quot; be exposed (to maintain optimal
<br>
defense mechanisms) is genome specific.  So exposure levels that help one
<br>
person in terms of extending lives might actually harm someone else.
<br>
<p>So long as we continue to remove pollutants from our environment and
<br>
cancer rates continue to decline I think we are on the right track.
<br>
(Though it takes some time (decades) for the epidemiology to provide
<br>
good indicators for this.)  You can see this playing out currently
<br>
in lawsuits against IBM for exposing semiconductor workers to hazardous
<br>
chemicals about 15 years ago.  But I'm somewhat doubtful that a
<br>
&quot;zero&quot; exposure rule would be the best strategy for the average
<br>
individual.
<br>
<p>Ultimately one needs to look at each carcinogen, its mechanism of action
<br>
and then have a good feeling for how it interacts with the detoxification
<br>
gene set (as well as the DNA repair set, the nutrient absorption gene set
<br>
and probably other gene sets) of the &quot;average&quot; individual.  Ultimately one
<br>
has to come back to the idea that &quot;all persons are created equal&quot; and
<br>
realize that it simply isn't true -- so one has to give up rational
<br>
principles that are based on that idea.
