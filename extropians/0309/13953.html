<p>Randall then said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, I think Steve's statement was about limited liability in

</em><br>
<p>Exactly. There's nothing to stop individuals or groups of individuals from
<br>
drawing up contracts that limit the liability of one or both parties (it's
<br>
an example of contracting out of or around obligations). That's not the same
<br>
thing as the specific legal institution of the LLC, which was invented
<br>
pretty recently (mid-nineteenth century to be precise).
<br>
<p>Robbie also said
<br>
<p>It's likely false that they COULD.  It's possible that you could write
<br>
a contract (without the backing of a government) that would &quot;in theory&quot;
<br>
limit your liability, it wouldn't ACTUALLY limit your liability because
<br>
without the government to INSIST that your liability is limited, the
<br>
victims of the companies &quot;ERRORS&quot; would come after you with pitchforks
<br>
(assuming they could find out who you were and what you'd done &quot;by
<br>
proxy&quot;).
<br>
<p>That's empirically false I'm afraid. Historically there have been mutual
<br>
enterprise contracts in which the liability of the investors for debts
<br>
arising from the enterprise were limited to the invested capital. These were
<br>
time limited (originally usually for one voyage - if Antonio had had any
<br>
brains that's what he would have done). The people who entered into
<br>
contractual arrangements with such a partnership were well aware of it and
<br>
could adjust their prices to take account of the perceived greater risk if
<br>
any. Point is it wasn't backed up by a legislated authority, so if the
<br>
perceived risk was too great no one would deal with the partnership. Also,
<br>
as I said, it didn't have perpetual succession, so the liability was limited
<br>
in time to the lifetime of the partnership.
