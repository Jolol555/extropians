<p>Consider the opposite:

<p>&quot;Definitely at 3:00pm&quot;  - that would be determinism.

<p><em>&gt;  it will *not* be a &quot;who knows&quot; situation

<p>It's hard to say whether or not this is an epistemological lack or an 
<br>
ontological &quot;missing piece&quot;.  I've heard that the human eye can 
<br>
distinguish difference of light intensity of 10 photons.  (I think JR 
<br>
Lucas said this, I don't know where he got his data).
<br>
<p>In any case, it may be strictly speaking NON-DETERMINISTIC whether or 
<br>
not someone will get cancer.  It may not.  But right now since the 
<br>
underlying physics of EVERYTHING is non-deterministic, we should expect 
<br>
it simply to be non-deterministic even in the case of higher-level 
<br>
biology.
<br>
<p>As far as I know Hume's criticism of &quot;deterministic causation&quot; qua 
<br>
constant conjunction is still a devestating argument against causal 
<br>
determinism.  In statistical sciences (like epidemiology) it's 
<br>
axiomatic.
<br>
<p>That there's a possibility that in the future our underlying theory of 
<br>
everything might change is always a negligible possibility.  There's no 
<br>
concrete proposal there to be asserted or denied.
<br>
<p>Best,
