<p>I reckon I could scare a few kiddies with a bit of creative devils
<br>
advocacy, but consider this 10 people is still rather a lot to have
<br>
a secret and to work together. Also it takes a person time to
<br>
acquire power, be it power from military or elected position,
<br>
power from knowledge or other forms. As people live longer
<br>
a few of the more cunning political animals will not be dropping
<br>
off by natural attrition. I can see Creighton and Kass potentially
<br>
making notes and rubbing hands with glee if we provide them
<br>
with two many details of what the right (wrong?) 10 might do
<br>
in future when lives are longer.
