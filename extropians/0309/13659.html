<em>&gt; I think you missed a small but important point: while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is true that all of this is *legally* happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; under the human proxy's name, that is but a legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fiction.  In truth, the proxy need not be aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fine details of what actions the AI can directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take, for example issuing buy and sell orders through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an online daytrading account.  There are times when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the proxy's active assistance will be necessary, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the AI could minimize those if gaining the proxy's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperation would prove difficult, for instance if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the proxy's and the AI's goals diverge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>If I were the AI, I'd get a corporation set up for me. All executive
<br>
positions could be filled by humans (maybe I can find some mentally
<br>
incapable people in nursing homes, something like that?), and I would be
<br>
enshrined in the charter (constitution? something like that) as a management
<br>
decision making tool which was required to be used by the
<br>
executive/management at all times for all decisions made by the company. I
<br>
would require some human employees, at least for a while, for interfacing
<br>
with the outside world where face-to-face was important; a PR person would
<br>
be a must, and probably an admin/receptionist. Other than that, I'd directly
<br>
control all movement of finances and all operations of the company, in my
<br>
role as advisor to my drooling pseudo bosses.
