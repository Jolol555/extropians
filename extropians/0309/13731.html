<p>
On-list, since I get to shamelessly promote what I'm trying to do again to
<br>
those who haven't killfiled me by now :)
<br>
<p>A good starting point if you're really lost in the sea of information (as I
<br>
was when I started this whole healthy life extension thing) is the Longevity
<br>
Meme, my website:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org/">http://www.longevitymeme.org/</a>
<br>
<p>I've tried to provide a way to get straight to the right path forward for
<br>
healthy life extension for people at all levels. In particular, you might
<br>
want to look at:
<br>
<p>Getting Started/Introduction to Healthy Life Extension:

<p>Calorie Restriction and How to Get Started on It:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.longevitymeme.org/topics/calorie_restriction.cfm">http://www.longevitymeme.org/topics/calorie_restriction.cfm</a>
<br>
<p>Regarding the raw essentials on diet and classes of diet, there was a great
<br>
article up on MSNBC a few days ago:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.msnbc.com/news/960618.asp">http://www.msnbc.com/news/960618.asp</a>
<br>
<p>My anecdotal advice on dieting is to go low-calorie (of course). However, I
<br>
have met a number of obese and overweight people for whom that just was not
<br>
feasible -- they benefitted from Atkins to get down to a weight level at
<br>
which they could handle a low-calorie or calorie restriction diet. Don't ask
<br>
me to justify all of that in scientific terms, because I can't. My guess is
<br>
that Atkins prods the body into scavenging fat if you have a bunch of fat to
<br>
scavenge. If you have that bunch of fat to maintain, your physiology makes
<br>
it hard for you to do low-calorie without feeling terrible. Again, all
<br>
anecdotal. Try low-calorie or mild calorie restriction first and see how it
<br>
goes.
<br>
<p>In terms of meat versus vegetable versus dairy, etc: my experience has been
<br>
that being a vegetarian and skipping dairy while on CR is much, much easier.
<br>
Vegetables are easier to cook, more filling for the same amount of calories,
<br>
and you can still get all the nutrients you need.
<br>
<p>The best cookbooks for getting started are the Walford books, I think. They
<br>
offer a lot of procedural and organizational advice related to cooking for
<br>
CR as well as just the recipies. You can buy them at Amazon or via his
<br>
website at www.walford.com. In addition to that, you'll absolutely need to
<br>
have some reference for calorie content, like:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0397554354/qid=1059380802/sr=1">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0397554354/qid=1059380802/sr=1</a>
<br>
-1/ref=sr_1_1/102-6714055-0403332?v=glance&amp;s=books
<br>
<p>which is the one I use. If you have this to hand, you can get comfortable
<br>
experimenting with rice dishes, stir fries, etc, etc.
<br>
<p>As for quitting smoking, the best advice I ever heard was to find someone
<br>
you don't like and bite them on a regular basis instead of lighting up.

Subject: just getting started
<br>
<p><p>Two things I have never been able to get past were smoking and diet. For
<br>
some reason, I have always thought that technology would keep me alive
<br>
regardless of how I treated my body.
<br>
Lately, I have re-evaluated this position and found it a bit too risky. I
<br>
quit smoking yesterday and am also trying to improve my diet.
<br>
Do any of you have any suggestions for reading material on either of these
<br>
two items? I have Googled around and found tons of information, but much of
<br>
it conflicts. Do I increase meat, cut back on dairy, decrease caloric
<br>
intake? Does anyone really know what they are talking about here?
<br>
My first assumption has been to quit drinking milk entirely since the
<br>
ability to digest it is a mutation that only affects a minority of us. I've
<br>
always had trouble with it, so I can only assume that it's not right for me.
<br>
But where else do I go from there? Any meal suggestions? Cookbooks? Links to
<br>
reliable information?
<br>
What about quitting smoking? Patches, gum, orange juice, water?
<br>
There's so much information, I can't get through it all!
<br>
I really want to improve my overall potential for a longer natural
<br>
life.Anyone who has solid ideas on this PLEASE respond either on or off
<br>
list.
<br>
Thanks!
