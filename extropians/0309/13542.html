<p>Isn't it  being able to act beyond and even contrary to basic survival 
<br>
mechanism programming that is required if we are to in any sense transcend 
<br>
our evolutionariy heritage?   So that they are tied to such mechanisms, if 
<br>
true which I am not convinced is the case,  merely says the job is hard not 
<br>
that it is unnecessary.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think (a) we may be able to refine while (b) may be much more difficult
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>But personal experiences as such are not terribly relevant to actually 
<br>
resolving political questions rationally.   Are you saying that they are so 
<br>
bound by personal experience that we cannot rationally discuss these things? 
<br>
If so then this is a strong argument for developing some intelligence other 
<br>
than humans and not believing that humans will transcend their conditioning.
