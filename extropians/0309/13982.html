<p>Dan, X-rays are an ionizing radiation and so are clearly harmful --
<br>
but one has to put them in context with respect to solar flares,
<br>
radon exposure, cosmic and X-rays from Gamma Ray Bursts and Magnetars,
<br>
how much one flys reducing atmospheric shielding, etc.  I have yet
<br>
to see a good evaluation of the relative risks.
<br>
<p>The way I try to deal with X-rays is try to overload on antioxidants
<br>
slightly prior to the X-ray.  So that means loading up on Vitamin-E
<br>
for a few days to a few weeks prior.  Vitamin-C might also be helpful
<br>
but it depends on ones iron level -- the more iron one has available
<br>
the more likely that Vitamin-C may act as a pro-oxidant rather than
<br>
an anti-oxidant.  Alpha Lipoic Acid and glutathione may also help
<br>
but I'm not sure we know enough about them currently.  We also don't
<br>
know enough about how external anti-oxidants impact the production
<br>
of internal anti-oxidants and whether one can &quot;overload&quot; the
<br>
oxidant sensing systems for a few days prior to having an X-ray.
<br>
(Thus allowing one to have greater defenses for a short period
<br>
before the system balances the internal production of anti-oxidant
<br>
molecules/enzymes with external supplementation.)  It is my personal
<br>
opinion that short-term overloading may be feasible.
<br>
<p>Vitamin E appears to be relatively non-toxic (up to several thousand
<br>
IU per day) -- so you can push the amount you consume for short periods
<br>
and probably be reasonably safe (compared with some other Vitamins,
<br>
esp. Vitamin A, where excessive consumption may be harmful.)
