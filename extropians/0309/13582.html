This is the best argument I have seen against the war on Iraq. Until now I
<br>
have fully supported it.Now I have to re-think it.

<p><p><em>&gt; Greg:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for your reply.  Let's stick to Iraq for now, talking about two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wars at once is almost as hard for me as watching them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You allude to a few reasons for attacking Iraq that I will paraphrase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here to make sure I've got a good understanding of what you're saying:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Iraq is a threat to the values of liberty and progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Saddam Hussein's regime had reneged on commitments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  It was time for a major social-upheaval in Iraq and we had to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the catalysts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Our &quot;Enlightenment-based&quot; culture is fundamentally in disagreement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Iraq's culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ___________________
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Going from our point of agreement, that nations shouldn't bomb other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations unless &quot;Forced&quot; to and your apparent contention that it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced, we need to get some agreement on what is meant by &quot;forced&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A nation is &quot;forced&quot; to do something if all other options would cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more pain, death and violence to their population than the one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I know that jumps through quite a few hoops - the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nationhood, the responsibility of the ruling class to its population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  I'm also not taking into account the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; additions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there should be universal responsibility of people making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility broader than just the population of the nation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.  In any case, I think the above definition should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively uncontroversial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding your reasons (1), (2), (3) and (4), it's pretty clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the counterfactual:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (5) &quot;There were other things we could have done to promote those goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would have been equally or more likely to cause less pain, harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and death to Americans.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; and quite stronger version:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (5e) &quot;There were other things we could have done to promote those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals which would have been equally or more likely to cause less pain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm and death to Humans.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is true barring any a priori determinism which would obviate the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral question.  That's assuming for the moment that the goals outlined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above are clear or worthy of pursuit about which I'm not sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It wouldn't take a tremendous amount of imagination to review those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate scenarios.  I believe that the French had a perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable proposal before the UN to step-up the effectiveness of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (now apparently completely effective) UN inspection regime and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic pressure that the US and its (at least prior to the war)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Allies can put on a nation is tremendous (if we're interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling the economic growth of another country which strikes me as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an illegitimate goal - what we've found is that wealthy people are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclined to go to war than the poverty-stricken).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you like it might be a worthy exercise in international diplomacy to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take a few minutes to rehash those alternate scenarios, or we can just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take that as a given.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In any case, in light of (5) and (6), don't you think it's false that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we were &quot;Forced&quot; to invade Iraq?  Or do you really think there was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; absolutely no other option?  If so, I'm interested in hearing more on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why there really were genuinely no other options.  I admit, it sounds a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit complicated, but I sense we're at least making progress on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identifying the source of our disagreements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robbie
</em><br>
