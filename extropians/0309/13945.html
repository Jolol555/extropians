<p>I agree with your second statement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you do control it, pertending that you aren't responsible because 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If you control something, you DO own it.  I agree, however, that
<br>
the current USian legal system is really screwed up on this point,
<br>
among others.
