On Mon, 15 Sep 2003, Jeff Davis offered some comments.
<br>
<p>I actually found the piece Reason pointed out quite interesting.
<br>
I even agreed with many of the points that it made.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you tax an (over)achiever, and thus reduce his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; income--take him down a notch from that to which he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has become accustomed--shall he not then, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conformity with his nature, resolve to redouble his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts, work harder, recover that which he has lost,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and strive as before for ever greater glory, and still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever greater glory after that?  Camels and capitalists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't quitters.  Rather they persevere right up to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moment when their back snaps. No?
</em><br>
<p>No.  Speaking from a personal basis if the top rates were
<br>
at 70% I'd either (a) be devoting a huge amount of energy
<br>
to learning how to play golf (a sport I'm rather not fond of) --
<br>
because that would be far more interesting than earning only
<br>
30% of for each additional increment of time I could devote
<br>
to my profession; or (b) spending my free time reading through
<br>
the tax code trying to figure out how to avoid those taxes;
<br>
or (c) devoting my extra time to political parties attempting
<br>
to get the tax rates reduced.
<br>
<p>Just as an FYI -- the first company I worked for at the tender
<br>
young age of 19 had the largest minicomputer in the city of NY
<br>
(larger even than tha largest minicomputer at Bell Labs at that
<br>
time).  What was it devoted to?  Clever analysis of the tax laws and
<br>
financial analysis so as to shelter the income of its parent
<br>
company using &quot;leveraged leases&quot;.  The tax reforms of the mid-80's
<br>
eliminated those loopholes but the Enron affair shows that there
<br>
are still a fair number of people devoting a huge amount of energy
<br>
to avoid taxes rather than more productive activies that might
<br>
boost economic growth.  The combination of (b) and (c) above,
<br>
and the Law of unintended consequences are one of the reasons
<br>
that the U.S. tax code is so complex.   And for those readers
<br>
who have never seen the tax manuals -- it makes an encyclopedia
<br>
look like a set of books for children.
<br>
<p>I'm sure Anders could offer a long list of people who have
<br>
exited Sweden due to its high tax rates.
<br>
<p>So at some point high tax rates shift behavior -- people either
<br>
leave the country or devote an increasing fraction of their
<br>
productive capacity to the task of avoiding taxes.
<br>
<p>Of course, deficit spending eventually requires that one bite
<br>
the bullet.  Interest rates eventually go up, currency valuation
<br>
goes down, people can less afford to purchase goods from other
<br>
countries, other countries have a reduction in foreign currencies
<br>
to purchase bonds that support the deficit -- in turn further driving
<br>
up interest rates (see my comments a few days ago about China
<br>
purchasing large quantities of U.S. Bonds).  Now as the interest
<br>
rates go up so do my house and car and business loan costs so
<br>
I focus on cheaper housing, how to make my car run another year,
<br>
how to cut my business costs by eliminating employees.  One recipe
<br>
for a recession.
<br>
<p>I've got no problem with cutting taxes -- but you have to do it with
<br>
a balanced or nearly balanced budget.  I see no evidence that the
<br>
current U.S. administration (executive or legislative) are managing
<br>
that responsibly.  The only exemption that I might see for this would
<br>
be the onset of the singularity -- and no current econometric models
<br>
incorporate that idea that I'm aware of.
<br>
<p>Robert
