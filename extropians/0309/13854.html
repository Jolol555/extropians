<p>In such cases I think it is irrational to expend that much energy and 
<br>
resources unless the population of said country is sufficiently ready to live 
<br>
in a more free state.  This readiness cannot be acheived by force.    Without 
<br>
this readiness the saying about teaching a pig to sing seems appropriate.  It 
<br>
will be terribly frustrating and only annoy the pig.

<p><em>&gt;

<p>Actually, massive public disobedience to the drug laws along with juries 
<br>
fairly consistently refusing to hand down guilty verdicts should do the 
<br>
trick.  That is largely what got us past the first Prohibition.

<p><em>&gt;You're not just stopping an act, you're

</em><br>
<p>Different, yes.  But this doesn't mean the fundamental principles are not the 
<br>
same.
