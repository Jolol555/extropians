<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Maybe for you. In other words, if I was to ever consider buying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something from you, I would have to worry that you will default on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contract, because, as you admit, you don't care about your word. Well, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needs to be remembered.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, if given a choice between fulfilling my contract and saving my 
<br>
life, I will save my life.
<br>
<p>If I were you, I would consider this a universal caveat on monetary 
<br>
contracts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Ostracism is a form of coercion - &quot;Leave your house OR ELSE&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Maybe I used a term which could be interpreted as something else -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; banishment. The sanction in merchant law is not banishment, it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoidance,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expulsion from the community, but not expropriation. Also, merchant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first voluntarily accepted by its users, in contrast to king's law. It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not coercion.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  If you take away &quot;king's law&quot; then I'd agree with you, 
<br>
however, the &quot;king's law&quot; tends to impinge on &quot;merchant law&quot;.
<br>
<p>You seem to be denying the interaction.  You're familiar with the 
<br>
concept of &quot;State Sponsored Monopoly&quot; right?
<br>
<p>In the United States, Land is a state-sponsored monopoly.  Banks can 
<br>
print money (or borrow at randomly low rates) and loan it to other at 
<br>
ever-increasingly-high amounts and rates.  This has the effect of 
<br>
making the banks the effective owners (eg, holding more than 80% of the 
<br>
equity position) in &quot;most houses&quot; owned by poor people.  The banks are 
<br>
put in this position whereas individual people are not - making the 
<br>
competition for real estate unfair.
<br>
<p>This system is backed-up by the repossession laws which makes it 
<br>
outright coercion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Now, you are saying I am infantile. Well, this makes an exchange of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments somewhat more difficult, doesn't it?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry, I thought you were offering an alternative definition for 
<br>
&quot;coercion&quot; like you are for &quot;morality&quot;.
<br>
<p>If you were to give up the terms &quot;Right and wrong&quot; in your discourse, 
<br>
we would have no further disagreements, clearly.
<br>
<p>Simliarly with coercion.  If you say it's &quot;bad&quot; but then identify it 
<br>
completely differently then what's the point of saying it's bad?
<br>
<p>In fact, what's the point of saying it's bad since you say &quot;There's no 
<br>
objective standard of bad.&quot;
<br>
<p>This amounts, if you ask me, to the simple contradiction:
<br>
<p>No things are bad.
<br>
Coercion is bad.
<br>
<p>You can't have it both ways - either things are bad, or they're not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Basically, you apply the word &quot;coercion&quot; to the outcomes of large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; numbers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people making decisions without use of fraud or non-contractual use of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical force (=the definition of the free market).
</em><br>
<p>I deny the existence of any free markets.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this way, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previously rather precise term (coercion = the use of non-contractual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical force against a person, or threat thereof) becomes rather 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vague, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; term of abuse, and an expression of dislike.
</em><br>
<p>Governments provide non-contractual physical force necessary to make 
<br>
any given market &quot;non-free&quot;.  Occasionally people do it as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; ### My statement goes &quot;Social goodness is whatever tends to get me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; and others most of what I and they want&quot;. For most well-informed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; low-emotional persons this will mean absolute (not relative)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; economic success under conditions of personal liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The project of defining morality by &quot;what most people want&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; hopeless and silly, you can see yourself going down that path here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Ah, another put down. Poor little me.
</em><br>
<p>You've already said &quot;There's no objective good and bad.&quot;
<br>
<p>And then you try to rescue &quot;Except breaking contracts&quot;
<br>
<p>Doesn't that &quot;silly&quot; and &quot;hopeless&quot; to you?  What interpretation am I 
<br>
missing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### You have a difficulty envisioning positive-sum interactions. Did 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elvis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Presley hurt an inordinate number of people (ignorantly? :-), in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of earning his billion dollars?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, but Sun Records definitely did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; BTW, since you think that the use of free market, and democracy to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; build a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morality based on getting people what they want is a silly and hopeless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; project (as you wrote a couple of paragraphs back), do you have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suggestions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for alternatives?
</em><br>
<p>Anarchy in the UK!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; No Elders of Zion, either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Stop being stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Ah, but I can't! :-)
</em><br>
<p>You brought up the Elders of Zion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Is there a Queen of England?  A Bank of England?  A Barclays?  An FMR
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Corporation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't know anything about kabal/illuminati/etc.  I do know that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wealthy use their power to keep their power and that has NEVER EVER
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; CHANGED.  Has it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### They keep trying - but they are losing, century by century, decade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decade.
</em><br>
<p>You obviously missed this one:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.thetip.org/snptotals.txt">http://www.thetip.org/snptotals.txt</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Today's advanced capitalist societies have a dramatically lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of power concentration and inequality (although some are plagued 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proliferation of mass special interest groups opposed to long-term 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; growth, like labor unions, or the retired).
</em><br>
<p>False.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The Queen of England has hardly anything to say outside her castles, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lady.
</em><br>
<p>False.  Who runs Barclays?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Don't be so envious and angry at the rich.
</em><br>
<p>Angry, yes.  Envious no.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Relax. They are human, too.
</em><br>
<p>Technically, I would describe them as parasites.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are not necessarily poorer because somebody gets rich.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if there are two things and I have both, you don't.
<br>
<p>If you want one, you've got to take it.  I could give it to you, but 
<br>
then I'd have less.  You'd have to trade something, but there's only 
<br>
the two things.
<br>
<p>The earth has a limited amount of fundamental resources - Land, Food, 
<br>
Energy, human effort, etc.  We can re-arrange the distribution of these 
<br>
items a lot (that's what the global economy IS...) but it doesn't 
<br>
usually create NET more land, food or human effort.
<br>
<p>In fact, in light of the WTO, apparently we are now destroying more 
<br>
food year after year - you know to satisfy the &quot;supply and demand&quot; 
<br>
economics.
<br>
<p>And yes, there are alternative value economic theories, Marx is the 
<br>
standard, I like the modifications by Istvan Meszaros.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Positive-sum games do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exist.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, like Amway.
<br>
<p>Robbie
