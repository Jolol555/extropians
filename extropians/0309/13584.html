Greg:
<br>
<p>Thanks for taking the time.
<br>
<p>I can see that our sole point of difference comes down to whether or 
<br>
not &quot;In the Long Run&quot; we had to act now.
<br>
<p>This strikes me as an epistemological question - given two possible 
<br>
long-term future outcomes, couldn't several short-term options lead to 
<br>
them given that we don't know what's going to happen as a result of our 
<br>
immediate action.
<br>
<p>Here's what I mean:
<br>
<p>If we choose to go to war - we could inadvertently further enrage the 
<br>
rest of the world while losing our current allies, thus further 
<br>
destabilizing our position in the area.
<br>
<p>OR
<br>
<p>If we choose to go to war we could have a definitive victory and it 
<br>
have a long-lasting impression on the neighbor &quot;Islamic&quot; states that 
<br>
gets them to change their ways.
<br>
<p>OR
<br>
<p>We could choose not to go to war and therebye further enrage the rest 
<br>
of the world while losing our current allies, thus further 
<br>
destabilizing our position in the area.
<br>
<p>OR
<br>
<p>We could choose not to go to war and therebye have a long-lasting 
<br>
impression on the neighbor &quot;Islamic&quot; states that gets them to change 
<br>
their ways.
<br>
<p>Before we act, we don't really know which one is going to happen.  
<br>
(Although we might have strong inclinations in one way or the other, we 
<br>
don't KNOW).  What we KNOW is that we have a CHOICE.
<br>
<p>If we have a choice, we are not being forced.  If we were not Forced in 
<br>
this sense, then we didn't have to bomb them, so we did it without 
<br>
necessity, and we both agreed, it was wrong to do so.
<br>
<p>I think the only way out of this would be something like a certaintity 
<br>
judgement for:
<br>
<p>We knew, before the fact, that the outcome would be better than all the 
<br>
possible outcomes.
<br>
<p>I just don't see any evidence of any kind for that kind of proposition. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I doubt that it can ever be produced unless you really are being 
<br>
forced and someone is genuinely amassing tanks at your borders.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie Lindauer
