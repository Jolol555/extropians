</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Bingo.  It isn't rational or at least it isn't based on the same suppositions 
<br>
about what is real.   If, as most religions teach, this world is basically 
<br>
illusory, or a test, or prelude to your &quot;real&quot; eternal existence if you don't 
<br>
screw it up, then the &quot;rational&quot; thing would be to do whatever it takes to 
<br>
escape illusion or not screw up and get away from this vale of tears.   So in 
<br>
this notion of what is &quot;real&quot; actions will be considered rational that are 
<br>
quite irrational under a different model of what is &quot;real&quot;.     The 
<br>
&quot;alternate reality&quot; folks in the religion business have an advantage over us.  
<br>
They get to tell their sheep that everything is really hunky-dory and we just 
<br>
aren't evolved or spiritual or whatever enough to see it and experience it 
<br>
yet.  They get to tell their people that they need do almost nothing to 
<br>
partake in the promise land but perhaps follow the dictates of some teaching 
<br>
or leaders now.  Since &quot;here&quot; is seen as unreal and ephemeral, why should 
<br>
anyone refuse to sacrifice illusory happiness now for &quot;real&quot; happiness later?  
<br>
And the game goes on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not a trivial question as many of these groups will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposed to the entire extropian/transhumanistic agenda.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are just lucky that we tend to be off of their radar at this time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Once the leaders of the more virulent groups grok that their flock may find 
<br>
our this world transcension of human suffering more appealing than the sweet 
<br>
by-and-bye, I suspect we will come in for a lot more unwelcome attention.
