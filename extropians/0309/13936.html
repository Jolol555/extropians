<p>There's a better reason that that.  The oil is nearly gone.  Current 
<br>
estimates say that 2001 (2000?, 2002?) was probably the highest year for 
<br>
pumping oil from the ground that will ever happen.  And getting the 
<br>
first half of the oil out is a lot cheaper than getting the second half 
<br>
of the oil out.  So look for oil prices to start climbing fast.  Until 
<br>
it becomes expensive enough that oil shales are profitable.  Then we'll 
<br>
have awhile to adapt, and the higher oil prices will make alternative 
<br>
more affordable (by comparison).  But higher oil prices will raise the 
<br>
price of EVERYTHING.  Ouch!
<br>
<p>And that's probably why we invaded the middle east.  To buy us a few 
<br>
more years.  Doesn't make it ethical, but makes it a bit more 
<br>
understandable.  (It's also why France got so pissed off at us.  They 
<br>
had made arrangements to acquire that oil, and we stole it.  Were I 
<br>
France, I'd be pissed off too.  But their arrangements were only 
<br>
slightly more ethical than ours.  Well, maybe twice as ethical.  But 
<br>
still pretty far from any base line.)
