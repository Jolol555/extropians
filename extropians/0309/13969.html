<p>Actually Michael, this may not be strictly true -- yes the p53 gene
<br>
and retinoblastoma (RB gene) mutations do certainly bias cells towards
<br>
cancer.  The standard &quot;5 mutations&quot; model is used mainly with colon
<br>
cancer I believe.  But there are other types of cancer, esp. leukemia
<br>
where the primary culprit is chromosome rearrangements (do a google
<br>
on &quot;Philadelphia Chromosome&quot;).  These are due to faulty DNA double
<br>
strand break repair processes (i.e. 2 chromosomes break and they
<br>
mismatched in the repair process).  One could call this a &quot;mutation&quot;
<br>
but it generally isn't identified as such.
<br>
<p>I think the counts at this point are something like 15-20 tumor suppressor
<br>
genes (like p53 and RB) and perhaps 50-100 tumor promoter genes.  One
<br>
generally has to get mutations in several of the tumor promoter genes
<br>
and 1 or more of the tumor supressor genes before the cell becomes
<br>
cancerous.  The p53 gene is a particular weak point because it seems
<br>
it plays a critical part of deciding whether the cell should commit apoptosis
<br>
(suicide) if things get too messed up.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its not just any five mutations, but a whole score of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutations can occur in different places in the genome.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but I would probably say that each specific type of cancer
<br>
results from an accumulation of a specific set of mutations
<br>
(or genomic changes) that cause the normal cellular control
<br>
processes to become defective.  That is why you can view aging
<br>
in part of the flip side of the coin from cancer.  We *know* from
<br>
cancer research that mutations and chromosomal rearrangements
<br>
are taking place.  One has to ask what kind of damage results
<br>
from the same types of mutations and rearrangements taking place
<br>
in those genes that are not involved in tumor suppression or
<br>
tumor promotion?  If one has a few hundred genes involved in
<br>
regulating cell division then one has 30,000+ genes involved
<br>
in dealing with other stuff.  What happens as they gradually
<br>
go bad?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; At least five of the target areas have to be mutation.
</em><br>
<p>Not strictly true as pointed out above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Eventually, all cells in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your body (with the exception of nuerons) are child cells of parents,
</em><br>
<p>Not quite accurate.  Obviously all the cells in your body are the child cells
<br>
of parent cells.  Different cells in your body have different regenerative
<br>
schedules.  The way I like to describe it is to consider the human body
<br>
to be organized like a doughnut.  The cells on the surface of the doughnut
<br>
are exposed to the environment -- these are primarily biased to renew
<br>
themselves on a regular basis (these are epithelial cells of one form
<br>
or another and are found in the skin, stomach, intestine, lung).  The
<br>
other major system biased towards cellular renewal are the blood and
<br>
immune systems.  These are the systems that are the primary sites where
<br>
cancer develops.  The other systems are biased towards reproduction
<br>
are those involved in reproduction (breast, ovary, prostate, etc.).
<br>
There are many systems biased against reproduction (heart, other muscles,
<br>
brain, kidney, etc.).  In these cancer is much less common.  The liver
<br>
appears to be the odd organ in that it is normally in non-cell-division
<br>
mode but can be shifted into cell-division mode if it is damaged enough.
<br>
<p>So one can view tissues that are biased towards cellular division
<br>
as already having a genetic program with a few &quot;mutations&quot; that
<br>
can lead down the path to cancer.  (When was the last time you
<br>
heard of someone getting &quot;heart cancer&quot;?)
<br>
<p>Now, dealing with Robbie's claims -- I would suggest that you go
<br>
do a google on &quot;aflatoxin grain cancer&quot;.  Aflatoxin is a toxin
<br>
produced by a natural fungus that is known to cause a specific
<br>
mutation(s) in the p53 gene.  It is a primary source of liver cancer
<br>
in China which has few or no constraints on the levels of aflatoxin
<br>
that may be present in grains or peanuts (which are particularly
<br>
susceptible to the fungus).  Now could you please explain how a toxin
<br>
produced by a natural fungus can be considered a &quot;pollutant&quot;?
<br>
The rise in exposure to aflatoxin is a consequence of the fact that
<br>
over the last several thousand years humans learned to store food
<br>
sources to allow them to survive years when crop harvests are poor.
<br>
So you can die from starvation or you may eventually die from cancer
<br>
due to long term aflatoxin exposure.  Take your pick.
<br>
<p>I am not saying that there is not any evidence that pollutants do
<br>
not contribute to cancer.  For example, there is overwhelming evidence
<br>
that some of the substances in tobacco smoke -- which one can probably
<br>
consider to be a pollutant -- do contribute to mutations and cancer
<br>
in a significant subset of the human population (in large part due
<br>
to their genetic makeup most probably).  However other pollutants,
<br>
such as lead, may have little relation to cancer but may instead
<br>
impact other functions such a neuronal development or activity.
<br>
<p>And in fact it *is* possible using chelation therapy to treat
<br>
overexposure to metals.  It is much more difficult to deal with
<br>
the mutations to the genomic DNA caused by plant toxins.
