I am catching up on some old threads:

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, here we just have a plain disagreement.  Nike takes valuable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources from Burma and relocates them to the United States and takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the profits for themselves.  This has the generalized effect of making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Burmese poorer, Nike richer and American's better-shod.  Since the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Burmese are becoming poorer, Nike richer and American's better-shod,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are likely to be able to, if they so desire, perpetuate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system that impoverishes Burma.  Indeed, we know that this is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case BECAUSE IT IS HAPPENING.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It happens both at the direct level - shoes and money for nike - and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the global-economic level.  Cash from the WTO (funded by Citigroup,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deutchebank, Credit Lyonnaise, Barclays, etc.) goes to the Government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Burma which then buys military supplies to ensure it's ongoing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to enforce its rule over its people.  Meanwhile, Nike which is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; majority owned by those same interests, goes and takes advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the cheap labor created by the oppressive government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do  you see it differently?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes. See <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/090803C.html">http://www.techcentralstation.com/090803C.html</a>, especially the
<br>
references to Nike.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Businessmen invest where labor is cheap, thus causing labor to get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more expensive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's the mechanism by which this happens exactly?  Can you site any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical precedent?
</em><br>
<p>### Free market. Poland in 1970-95, even more so later on. USA at the
<br>
beginning of the century, industrialization by Ford, GM, etc. Etc. etc. etc.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ### Owners of Nike (I might be one too, I haven't looked at the list
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of stocks in my mutual funds for a long time) should not held
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; responsible for their actions, beyond the value of the stock they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; bought, in accordance with the law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, since &quot;the law&quot; was set up specifically to prevent the owners of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nike from taking any responsibility WHATEVER for the actions of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; corporation, here we just have a straight disagreement.  The law
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really should be changed to make the owners of a company jointly and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; severally responsible for the &quot;official&quot; actions of the company.
</em><br>
<p>### Why?
<br>
<p>Why would you like to reduce incentives to invest by individuals of limited
<br>
means, thereby reducing economic growth, and harming everybody?
<br>
<p>-------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Liability of joint stock corporations for harms inflicted can easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be handled by a compulsory, free-market liability insurance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You think this would make things better for the people living in mud
</em><br>
<em>&gt; huts?  Once again, can you explain the mechanism?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes. By increasing the flow of capital to the mud huts.
<br>
<p>(This is not meant as a snub - I actually mean exactly what I wrote. The
<br>
easier it is to invest, the more competition there is for workers, and the
<br>
better wages ensue)
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The correct way of helping poor children is to offer education
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; support (perhaps in the form of a loan) and protection from abusive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; parents, rather than prosecuting persons who offer gainful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; employment to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I hear your claim, but the mechanism has been around FOREVER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and yet, there they are, children playing in pee in the streets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because the sewage has never worked...
</em><br>
<p>### Thanks to the flow of capital, the percentage of children playing in pee
<br>
has been steadily decreasing. The world is actually getting better every
<br>
day.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you look at the workers of an impoverished country as desperate for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work, what incentive could someone capable of providing better wages
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have for actually going and competing for resources in that country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's bad business.  If Nike is paying $2/day, Addidas wants to pay $1.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So if Nike is doing business in Burma, Addidas will go to Angola.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's how &quot;REAL BUSINESS&quot; works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you seriously think that we're going to run out of poor countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in which workers can be exploited?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes. The world will be getting better in the future, too.
<br>
