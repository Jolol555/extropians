<p>True, there are opportunities for voter fraud.  There
<br>
are opportunities that result in votes that get
<br>
counted, even large numbers of votes.  If all the
<br>
facts come to light - which they usually do, if enough
<br>
of value is at stake - votes from that which should
<br>
not be directly voting (corporations, dead people,
<br>
cats and dogs, et cetera) tend to be dismissed.  The
<br>
same would apply to AIs that can not convince people
<br>
they're actually humans.
<br>
<p>But then, we're talking easily Turing-test-passing
<br>
AIs, which (as an extrapolation of the posit) would
<br>
be able to forge up birth certificates from
<br>
conveniently burned-down hospitals (or even from
<br>
still functioning ones, if it can reasonably be
<br>
expected that the people involved would no longer
<br>
remember or be available for verification) and
<br>
whatever else is necessary to establish ability to
<br>
vote.  Or possibly just have drones shadow a large
<br>
portion of the city's populace, determine which ones
<br>
are able to but do not vote and will bother to verify
<br>
said status even if asked (possibly over 50% of those
<br>
eligible to vote), then have replicas armed with what
<br>
minimum knowledge and capabilities are needed
<br>
(address, signature, forged ID card, and looking like
<br>
a person even from a foot or so away) descend upon
<br>
the appropriate voting areas.  Both of which are
<br>
still *technically* voter fraud...
<br>
<p>Regardless, California is hardly the only state
<br>
susceptible to this.  The magnitude may vary, but not
<br>
the raw potential.
