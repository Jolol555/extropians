&nbsp;&nbsp;1) ground based laser propulsion - &quot;lightcraft&quot; - this has been working in proto-type stage for years...all we really need is higher powered lasers (and the weapons boys are working on those for their own ends...) see <a href="http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/laser_propulsion_000705.html">http://www.space.com/businesstechnology/technology/laser_propulsion_000705.html</a> for some background
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;This would be nice, although I don't see the full potential for this ever coming to pass since other things such as nanotech seem likely to develop beforehand
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;2) beanstalk! - this has been limited before now by the need for a strong material from which to fabricate the supporting structure. Various forms of nano-tubes are being developed and all thats really holding this back at this point is the ability to construct longer strands of the tough material cheaply. Lots of research on lots of fronts that will lead quickly to addressing this need. See <a href="http://www.isr.us/SEHome.asp">http://www.isr.us/SEHome.asp</a> for background and details.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Way bad idea. imagine a scenario where a space elevator were placed into GEO with an altitude of 36,000 km (22,369 miles). If that happened to come loose, seperate, or otherwise have a problem with the orbit, the entire length would come crashing to Earth wrapping itself almost entirely around the planet. (circumference of 24901.55 miles at the equator) This could be rather ugly.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;3) ?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The $$ and effort that would be spent revamping the Saturn V lifters, or developing the &quot;next generation&quot; shuttle could be spent with a much higher return in developing these or other similar projects. Give up on the idea of massive rockets and consider the alternatives...lets move toward a real reusable approach ;-)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I do have to agree with you. The Saturn V was an American (German) creation. Like anything else American, it's all about size. Even in cars, it seems our fastest engines are designed by burning as much fuel as possible as quickly as possible. It's Corvette vs. Porsche. Maybe there is something else we can come up with besides basic newtonian physics to get us out of the gravity well. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whatever it is though, it must be a long way off. The physics behind rockets and car engines are similar in that they both produce movement by burning fuel. We still can't seem to make a car with the same &quot;pickup&quot; as a gasoline engine. Granted, a laser car isn't an option since we can't have high-power laser shooting everywhere, but I would like to see something new that can move us around more efficiently. Maybe the recent increase in the study of anti-matter will pave the way for something new and wonderful.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(estimates here of ~$40/lb (or less) for lift to orbit and high volume transports not limited &quot;launches&quot;)
