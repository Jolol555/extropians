<p>Amara, I would *not* be so fast to back off on this.  There has
<br>
been a recent PBS special in the U.S. running on Luther I think.
<br>
It points out how dogmatic the Catholic church had become (IMO
<br>
it still is).  At least one analysis I've seen regarding the
<br>
issue of priests and marriage suggests the restriction that priests
<br>
must be celibate had nothing to do with anything in the Bible but
<br>
had primarily to do with having priests leave their wealth to the
<br>
church rather than their heirs.  Pure self-interest at work.
<br>
The consequence, in part, being the current molestation scandals.
<br>
<p>Now, why the reformation may have promoted individual self-interpretation
<br>
of the text of the Bible -- it seems to have given way to &quot;fundamentalism&quot;.
<br>
I am not sure when and why this took place.  I suspect it has something
<br>
to do with the power of leaders to convince people to interpret things
<br>
in a specific way.  Spike has pointed out to me several times that
<br>
the Bible can probably be used to justify almost anything.  I suspect
<br>
that the same is true of the Koran.
<br>
<p>So the problem is *not* a 'reformation' per se but the fact that some
<br>
people abuse the 'reformation' process to convince people to interpret
<br>
the text in a certain specific way -- rather than allow people to
<br>
interpret it in their own way.  Such behavior is a power grab and
<br>
is rooted in basic survival instincts.  One can see this between
<br>
both the people who have religious power in Iran and the young
<br>
college students there as well as the old and young shiites in Iraq.
<br>
<p>Friedman has an interesting observation with respect to &quot;tribes&quot;
<br>
in the NY Times today [1]...
<br>
<p>{ Technology, though, still can't trump two huge impedients to Arab
<br>
democracy. One is the lack of institutions to ensure a peaceful rotation
<br>
of power. &quot;In too many countries there is still a tradition of rule or die
<br>
- either my group or tribe is in power or it's exposed to great danger, so
<br>
you must never give up power,&quot; noted Michael Mandelbaum, author of &quot;The
<br>
Ideas That Conquered the World.&quot;
<br>
<p>The other is that so many Arab economies are dominated by state oil
<br>
revenues and state companies, with private enterprise very weak.
<br>
Therefore, holding onto or being close to power are the only pathways to
<br>
wealth. Control power, control wealth. &quot;It will be very hard to install
<br>
lasting democracy in this region,&quot; Mr. Mandelbaum added, &quot;without
<br>
institutions and economic reforms that guarantee that there is life after
<br>
power and wealth without power.&quot; }
<br>
<p>It would be interesting to bring either the &quot;nanotech&quot; or &quot;AI&quot; discussions
<br>
to the table in Arabic countries since both would seem to trump concerns
<br>
about &quot;tribal power&quot; and &quot;survival instincts&quot; in various ways.
