<p>My apologies then. I'm beginning to wonder if anyone
<br>
thinks friendliness is doable and if it isn't perhaps we'd
<br>
do well to recognize that.

<p>Yep incrementally developed AI, multiple locations,
<br>
no rapid take off effect on the singularity. Similar to
<br>
Anders view (as I understand it).
<br>
<p>But the US govt (I'm not picking on it, it is just the big
<br>
one at present) can do quite a comprehensive survey 
<br>
of developing AI projects presumably and possible 
<br>
classify some private sector work that seeks patents 
<br>
or it otherwise becomes aware off, (all in the &quot;national
<br>
interest&quot; of course - not being facetious here - well
<br>
not completely).
<br>
<p>In such a way a well resourced govt dept might be able
<br>
to come up with an AI that is a substantial increment 
<br>
on what else is around as they are *both* well resourced
<br>
and have access to all the public domain stuff and need 
<br>
not share what they (the govt dept) knows. 
<br>
<p>I think there are some precedents for this in the 
<br>
development of computers to crack Enigma, and in a
<br>
sort of RSA encryption from memory. (see Simon
<br>
Singh's: The Code Book).
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3 - The enslaved AI is simply so damned good 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; at running a company that more and more decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; making functions are delegated to it over time;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; management automation. 
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Note that in this last case, the management 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; automation software need not even be self aware, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; just really good at what it does.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI might even emerge from cobbled together, ever more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skilled expert systems and other AI-ish bits and pieces. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drexler talks about this, doesn't he?
</em><br>
<p>He may. I don't think of Drexler as the AI guy. To me he's 
<br>
&quot;the MNT guy&quot;, but he may.  
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
