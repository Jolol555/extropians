<em>&gt; If it is zero sum, there must be a winner and a loser.  Are you a loser
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely because I would not do the welding for no trade whatsoever?
</em><br>
<p>Neither loses or gains.  I guess I misunderstood your question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; The earth itself has no wealth.  Only the people on it have wealth and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; they have it by virtue of their effort.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Effort?  As in what, physical labor?  Calories expended?  What about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who sit in front of a computer all day processing information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turning not so valuable information into more valuable information.
</em><br>
...
<br>
<em>&gt; Does this not demonstrate that 'effort' as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed through technology has no limit to its value?
</em><br>
<p>Each person should be able to determine the value of their own time.  
<br>
That's what freedom is.
<br>
<p>If you say &quot;I'll give you a dollar to play guitar for me for an hour.&quot;
<br>
<p>I might do it, I might not.  Depends on how I feel, if I'm free, etc.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; How is 'addressing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unstable commodity prices' any different than keeping up &quot;supply and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demand&quot; theories?
</em><br>
<p>I don't.  I don't subscribe to the &quot;commodity&quot; supply and demand 
<br>
theory.  I said so above - value is given by human effort.  My 
<br>
conjecture is that the coffee spilt that way was thusly spilt to 
<br>
bolster the price in a waning market.  This is what happens when the 
<br>
notional supply and demand are used as cover for global capital and it 
<br>
shows the underlying contradictions in the notion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After all, if what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; said above were true, I wouldn't be paying $8.95 for a BLT in Westwood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not?  If you can make a BLT cheaper, start your own BLT joint.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Efficient markets&quot;  If the theory is that food is becoming more 
<br>
available with time, it SHOULD follow that it would become less 
<br>
expensive with time too, right?
<br>
<p>Unless, that is, it is the service and effort of BRINGING THE FOOD TO 
<br>
ME that I'm paying for which far outweighs the value of the underlying 
<br>
food.
<br>
<p>I pay the $8.95 because even though I know I could buy a baby-pig for 
<br>
$8.95 and raise to a 1000-pound pig for around $100, enough to make 
<br>
about 5-10,000 BLT's (really hammy-ones), I don't because the trouble 
<br>
of dealing with it is worth paying for - that's the human effort part.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ok, your libertarian descriptions fit me as well, yet I certainly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't call myself a 'peacefull anarchist' (how do you propose it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain 'peacefull' anarchy, btw?)
</em><br>
<p>I trust people who own big guns to not f-with other people who own big 
<br>
guns.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I despise corporate subsidy and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general interference of the market by rediculous government intrusion.
</em><br>
<p>Me Too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I would like to hear more of what kind of system you would propose.
</em><br>
<p>(I hope) I'll know paradise when I get there.  Until then I'll just 
<br>
complain :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does your peacefull Anarchist society have property rights?  Who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforces them?
</em><br>
<p>Me, you, them.  If, as you say, there's plenty of food, land and water, 
<br>
there shouldn't be any problem.
<br>
<p>People would have to recognize the value of what they'd achieved to 
<br>
make it worth keeping.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do they have a right to take my provisions?
</em><br>
<p>That's an ethical issue, not a legal one.  They have no right to steal 
<br>
from you, but you SHOULD share with them if you can, that would be &quot;The 
<br>
right thing to do.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Who forces the Doctor to treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my ailments to achieve 'adequate' health care?
</em><br>
<p>Assuming you've been nice to your doctor, why wouldn't he be nice to 
<br>
you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Especially If I can not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay him, and no government exists to coerce him.
</em><br>
<p>He should help you.  The Government isn't exactly helping right now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Shall my best friend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just hold a gun to his head?
</em><br>
<p>How about asking nicely, most people are reasonable when asked.  If the 
<br>
doctor knows that he can't extract unreasonable fees for his services, 
<br>
then he will ask for reasonable fees.  If a doctor becomes known as 
<br>
&quot;That guy who cheats dying people&quot; then his business would dry up 
<br>
pretty quick I imagine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Oh, right, you said a 'peacefull
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anrachist', I suppose Ill just ask him politely to perform required
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operation)
</em><br>
<p>Sounds good, but I'd expect you to have planned well enough that you 
<br>
could pay a reasonable fee and/or contracted with some insurer.  (Who 
<br>
in turn would pay because if they didn't you'd be pissed and so would 
<br>
the rest of their customers.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Truthfully, I don't understand how this system could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly exist, unless each and every person in it is immortal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perpetually healthy, and always with shelter and food.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe.  Maybe not.  I say it's worth a try because THIS isn't working.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is that so?  I guess most communist governements just never got to sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around long enough to turn into full anarachies.
</em><br>
<p>It's an empirical question and so I am agnostic about it.  The Chinese 
<br>
government, if it's Communist, has an opportunity to become a 
<br>
government-less body.  I doubt that they will, personally.  You may be 
<br>
more optimistic.  Until they, no three-children chinese families.  The 
<br>
Russian Government clearly failed.
<br>
<p>I take it that those two examples are the best evidence we have in the 
<br>
matter outside of small communes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How does peaceful anarachy alleviate global poverty?  (food, shelter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and adequate health care)
</em><br>
<p>By letting people benefit from their own land and labor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 'Inadequate'?  That's an understatement if I have ever heard one,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considering it is responsible for 170 million deaths this century.
</em><br>
<p>Right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is 'forced alienation of our labor' and what about volunteer labor.
</em><br>
<p>Forced alienation of our labor is TAXATION or other kinds of coerced 
<br>
(in the broad sense of &quot;essentially forced&quot;) extraction of resources 
<br>
and time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also note, we can not exist without labor, we must labor for our food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How is that dichotomy settled?  Food will not fall from the sky and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your mouth, and with no government to provide it, where will it come
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from?
</em><br>
<p>I expect a nice little farm might do the trick.  On the Kibutz groups 
<br>
of people come together to build farms that sustain them and then take 
<br>
turns on it.  That's ONE way.  Another way is just to farm your own 
<br>
land.   Another way is to provide a sufficiently valuable service that 
<br>
other people would simply give you food.
<br>
<p>I know guitarists that make their livings this way, for instance.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;  If I chose to stop working,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would lose my house.
</em><br>
<p><p>Not stop working, we are in agreement that you must produce to provide 
<br>
for yourself.  Try stop paying taxes.
<br>
<p>Alienation simply means taking something that was yours and making it 
<br>
someone else's.  Forced alienation is when someone MAKES you do it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I have little need for rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; throwers, but need computer programmers.
</em><br>
<p>People manage to figure out valuable things that other people want.  
<br>
They don't need governments to show them how to do this.  Governments 
<br>
come in when small groups of people band together and force other 
<br>
people into submission by violence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Agreed, tentatively.  But are some governments 'less bad' than others?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Say, for example, Pol Pot's Cambodia vs. Australia?
</em><br>
<p>Not clear.  It may be that the underlying factors which support 
<br>
Australia also support Pol Pot.  I understand that the CIA was funding 
<br>
Pol Pot's campaign against his people.
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Do I have to want the singularity in order to want to live much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; longer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, but I don't see how any of the ideas you propose would make it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objectively make it likely that you would live any longer.  Though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would certainly entertain any evidence.
</em><br>
<p>Number one killer in America for males over 30 (me) - Heart Disease.  
<br>
Major cause of heart-disease - STRESS.  Major cause of stress - 
<br>
overwork.
<br>
<p>Number 2 killer - Cancer.  Number 1 cause of cancer - unknown 
<br>
environmental factors.  I personally attribute them to the pollutants 
<br>
required by modern cities to keep the engines greased.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; As Gorby pointed out in the late 80's, Singapore generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; than the ENTIRE Soviet Union.  But it must have been because
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; it was exploiting the working man, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Without any doubt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Did the people of singapore live better lives than the people of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soviet union?
</em><br>
<p>Which people?
<br>
<p>I hear Gorby had a really, really nice limousine.  Maybe there were 
<br>
more really-really-nice limousines per capita in Singapore than Russia, 
<br>
I don't know.
<br>
<p>Best,
