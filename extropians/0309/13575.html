<p>I think this is a good idea. Ideally we have a few different
<br>
recipient hosts in different places to make unusual delays more
<br>
noticeable. With a grid of emailers one could even make a crude
<br>
map of unusual delays (&quot;A political censorship front is moving
<br>
across Central Europe, with serious delays expected in
<br>
Switzerland and Bosnia. Meanwhile the anti-porn system across
<br>
the United States is weakening and moving towards Canada&quot; :-)
<br>
<p>I did a simple study by hand, sending email to myself through
<br>
some other account. The Patriot act took 6 seconds, a rot13
<br>
version 25 s and a file listing of the same length 10 s. No
<br>
evidence there, but it also showed the importance of making sure
<br>
that the clocks of the different senders and receivers are
<br>
synchronized or have a known time differences.

<p><em>&gt; Does anyone have a mail-account at a well-known, likely to be monitored

<p>I would like to participate, although my email system might be a 
<br>
bit strange. My suggestion is that we really should look at 
<br>
accounts at the big ISPs like AOL, which make natural choke 
<br>
points. It would also be fun to use some account at a 
<br>
&quot;rebel-friendly&quot; ISP or site.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm really interested in this question.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. I would be very surprised if we found anything, but just 
<br>
like SETI the payoff of even an unlikely positive result would 
<br>
be great enough to motivate it.
