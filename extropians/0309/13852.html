<p>Does Nike operate sweatshops?  Did they lie about it?  Is that OKAY

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, by simple calculations, by experiments, by observations of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; markets. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole of economics, ever since Adam Smith, describes the effects of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and demand on the price and availability of goods and services. Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keynesians admit such basics. Are you aware of any alternative economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, which would deny the right of supply and demand?
</em><br>
<p>So Keynes and Smith say so, is your current position.  Do you go along 
<br>
with EVERYTHING they said?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; You mean keeping them in their mud huts?  What USUALLY happens is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; peasants revolt and are put-down occasionally by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; capitalist-funded leaders.  At least, this is how it works in Burma.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### More people crawled out of the mud in the last century than in all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centuries before. That's how it worked in the US, in Poland, in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnam, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will work in Burma.
</em><br>
<p>There are MORE PEOPLE than in the last century.  Percentages matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, poverty is up worldwide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### If you choose your source of facts appropriately, you will find 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Elvis lives, and the Earth is flat. For economic data try OECD, WHO, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; UN, US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dept of Commerce.
</em><br>
<p>Let's see your legitimate &quot;poverty is in decline&quot; source.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Yes, the percentage of poor changed - from 100% about 8 000 years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to today's less than 20%.
</em><br>
<p>According to the Bible, Abraham had 200 tents and thousands of 
<br>
servants.  That's not 100%.
<br>
<p>Poverty is NOT less than 20% - even in the United States.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But now I see why you need to laugh at the least provocation - your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispel the darkness, your view of the world is so gloomy, evil and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poverty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rising everywhere, rapacious capitalists raping the planet, no hope 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future, and those who have it, must be suckers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sad, sad.
</em><br>
<p>Truly sad indeed.
<br>
<p>Hope for future is an empirical question.  I think my life will be very 
<br>
pleasant.  Do I think that the rest of the world will have as pleasant 
<br>
a life as mine, no.
<br>
<p>I like to call it cold realism.  You should try it.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; How do you think someone like you could accumulate the effective labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of lots of other people without actually performing that labor
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; yourself?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I have no need to accumulate the labor of other people. I will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million $ on my own, and then another, and another - with cryonics and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extension, could go on for a long time.
</em><br>
<p>How will you do this?  Don't say Amway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### You know I am a staunch opponent of coercion. I will benefit only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people working for their own gain, freely, such as the Nike workers in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wherever they are.
</em><br>
<p>So are you just ignorant of the political repression in Burma that 
<br>
causes them to be subject to abject poverty and willing to take shitty 
<br>
jobs?
