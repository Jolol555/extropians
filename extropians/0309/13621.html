<em>&gt; Not so -- K-selection vs. R-selection will apply selection pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly if the &quot;elders&quot; of a group contribute significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the survival of their children, grand-children, etc.  This seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be true in humans, elephants and whales -- though there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is still a fair amount of academic debate on this topic.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I see your point here. I hadn't considered that. I keep forgetting that
<br>
&quot;social&quot; aspect of our nature. Maybe because I'm reclusive. :-)
<br>
Still, I have to wonder what, if any, contribution &quot;elders&quot; would have that
<br>
were significant enough to increase the likelihood of grand-children
<br>
surviving to reproductive age in the early hunter-gatherer tribes of modern
<br>
humans. The only thing I can think of is to help raise and educate the young
<br>
while the parents were away hunting and gathering. But it is my
<br>
understanding that the sharing of food was an early development in hominid
<br>
evolution and that by the time modern humans arose, the women were most
<br>
likely staying &quot;home with the kids&quot;. I may be wrong here and maybe someone
<br>
will accuse me of being a sexist, but that's just what I remember when I was
<br>
researching it years ago. Also, given the social nature of (most)human
<br>
beings, one would think that if a grandparent dies, the rest of the &quot;tribe&quot;
<br>
would pitch in and help raise and protect the child.
<br>
<p>In order for this scenario to work, the death of an &quot;elder&quot; via prostate
<br>
cancer at age 60 would have to have enough impact on a &quot;family&quot; to cause the
<br>
death of a grand-child before they were able to reproduce. This would have
<br>
to happen in the majority or nearly all cases at which time the mutation
<br>
that causes prostate cancer would eventually disappear. If it happened
<br>
occasionally, I don't think it would have enough impact on the mutation to
<br>
make a difference.
<br>
<p>I am under the impression that the average human life span was only 40-50
<br>
years during this time. The most likely causes of death were from diseases,
<br>
not cancers. If this is the case and most cancers occur later in life, then
<br>
it would onlyhave been after the life expantancy of humans began to increase
<br>
when selection pressures would start taking affect on that particular
<br>
mutation. If the mutation that caused that cancer 40-50 thousand years ago,
<br>
it would be well distributed throughout the population before these
<br>
selection pressures began to apply themselves. In the last few hundred
<br>
years, life expectancy has increased by about 25 years which means that it
<br>
would only be during this period when the mutation should start working its
<br>
way out of the population. Today, grandparents rarely play a necessary part
<br>
in the survival of the grandchild except in the death of the parents or such
<br>
similar events. So once again, this mutation should continue to make its way
<br>
through the population. Maybe if parents had children but grandparent raised
<br>
them, we could naturally weed this out in a few tens of thousands of years,
<br>
but for the most part, we try to take care of everyone, even if their
<br>
caretaker passes away.
<br>
<p>Again, it would be very interesting if we could tie these cancers to
<br>
specific mutations and date them.
<br>
<p>The scary part is the intermixing of people. History has shown that people
<br>
breed wherever and whenever possible. Everyone is a hodgepodge of DNA with
<br>
the same mitochondrial DNA dating back to mitochondrial &quot;Eve&quot;. Given enough
<br>
time, you would think that most people will carry most of the mutations that
<br>
cause most of the cancers. All humans will be big cancer bags unless we do
<br>
something about it at the genetic level to rid ourselves of these things.
<br>
<p>Also, as human life-spans increase, new ones will undoubtably crop up that
<br>
remained hidden, being secretly passed along to offspring for thousands of
<br>
years, until we reached the age where it started to cause problems.
