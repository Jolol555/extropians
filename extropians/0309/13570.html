<p>Hardly, God wants &quot;good people&quot; to make it to heaven in just about  
<br>
every Theistic religion.  (Few people are philosophically advanced  
<br>
enough to ask the question &quot;Does God always want what is really Good or  
<br>
is Goodness just defined by what God wants?&quot;)
<br>
<p>These people are simply doing what they think is Right.  And that is  
<br>
probably not as far from what you think is right as you might think.   
<br>
Keep reading:
<br>
<p>If you take him at his word:
<br>
<p>&quot;The call to wage war against America was made because America has  
<br>
spear-headed the crusade against the Islamic nation, sending tens of  
<br>
thousands of its troops to the land of the two Holy Mosques over and  
<br>
above its meddling in its affairs and its politics, and its support of  
<br>
the oppressive, corrupt and tyrannical regime that is in control.   
<br>
These are the reasons behind the singling out of America as a target.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-  
<br>
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/">http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/binladen/who/</a> 
<br>
interview.html
<br>
<p>That's a pretty good summary.  IF you take him at his word.  Another  
<br>
possibility is, of course, that he's just putting on a show to gain  
<br>
himself more power within his political basis.  But if that's the case,  
<br>
then at least we know that these are the issues that are driving his  
<br>
political basis.
<br>
<p>There's also the possibility that some deeper conspiracy is going on -  
<br>
perhaps the old &quot;backing both sides&quot; thing is happening somewhere in  
<br>
the vaults of secrecy.  I have no idea.  That whole executive privilege  
<br>
thing gets used quite a lot nowadays basically negating the Freedom of  
<br>
Information Act as regards the Presidency and for that matter  
<br>
Administrative Branch.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Social pressure?
</em><br>
<p>For some segments of the population of the Islamic nations, surely  
<br>
Poverty and Hopelessness are contributing to their dislike of American  
<br>
Foreign Policy.  I'd recommend a nice documentary circulating called  
<br>
&quot;What I learned about US Foreign Policy&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Desire for power by the leaders?
</em><br>
<p>An ever-present sin.  The leaders like selling oil to the US - it makes  
<br>
them rich - they don't work very hard...  BUT they have to show a  
<br>
certain amount of loyalty to their own people and religion and culture  
<br>
so they have to at least look vaguely defiant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It simply does not seem rational.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you ignore the material basis.  It seems perfectly rational if  
<br>
you think of it from their point of view.  The easiest way to do that  
<br>
is just turn it around:
<br>
<p>If Saudi Arabia were stationing troops around Hollywood and Vine and  
<br>
Disneyland while selling Quran's to your daughters and sons and giving  
<br>
them jobs and extolling the virtues of Alla and changing the currency  
<br>
to shekels and insisting that Arabic be taught in all the schools,  
<br>
you'd be pretty upset too.
<br>
<p>And if they were simultaneously supporting a despotic regime (actually,  
<br>
they probably are, we're just too dumb to see it) that was causing  
<br>
chronic poverty not just here but in Canada, England and Australia too,  
<br>
we'd be rallying the Canadians and Australians around the cause of  
<br>
ejecting the Saudi's from the US at any cost.  And if our armies  
<br>
weren't big enough, you can be sure we'd turn to guerilla warfare.   
<br>
Witness Northern Ireland.  White people fight too.
<br>
<p>And if they were simultaneously supporting Mexico in a border dispute  
<br>
that had been violent for 40-years and had been escalating in the last  
<br>
two years.
<br>
<p>(Of course they have all kinds of other ancient morality concerns that  
<br>
are equally vexing to them about us - especially the whole equality of  
<br>
Women thing.  I expect that they'd learn to live with American Women  
<br>
wearing pants if there weren't the 10,000 soldiers standing behind them  
<br>
on the lawn.  That's what appears to have happened in Egypt.)
<br>
<p>The list is endless, the US is not innocent in this by any means.
<br>
<p>It's clear that one part of Burch's reasons for US going to war with  
<br>
Iraq is true - our Cultures are incompatible.  But not because we're  
<br>
different - because we're the SAME.
<br>
<p>The question for civilization will be whether or not the US and it's  
<br>
Enlightenment values have grown up enough to try to help others rather  
<br>
than simply destroy them &quot;Just because we can&quot;.  If we can't reach a  
<br>
level of civilization where people don't kill each other just because  
<br>
they can, then our hope for survival has got to look pretty slim given  
<br>
the technological advances.
<br>
<p>This will require concessions on ALL sides.
<br>
<p>The preemptive policy of war against a country developing nuclear  
<br>
weapons is a seemingly sensible defense tactic NOW.  But think about  
<br>
200 years from now when weapons technology has really started taking  
<br>
off and a 5-man crew could blow up the earth without so much as  
<br>
alerting the authorities.  Sometime between NOW and THEN we're going to  
<br>
have to come up with something more reasonable, and EVERYBODY is going  
<br>
to have to like it.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
