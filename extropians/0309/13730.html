<p>
Two things I have never been able to get past were smoking and diet. For some reason, I have always thought that technology would keep me alive regardless of how I treated my body.
<br>
Lately, I have re-evaluated this position and found it a bit too risky. I quit smoking yesterday and am also trying to improve my diet.
<br>
Do any of you have any suggestions for reading material on either of these two items? I have Googled around and found tons of information, but much of it conflicts. Do I increase meat, cut back on dairy, decrease caloric intake? Does anyone really know what they are talking about here?
<br>
My first assumption has been to quit drinking milk entirely since the ability to digest it is a mutation that only affects a minority of us. I've always had trouble with it, so I can only assume that it's not right for me.
<br>
But where else do I go from there? Any meal suggestions? Cookbooks? Links to reliable information? 
<br>
What about quitting smoking? Patches, gum, orange juice, water? 
<br>
There's so much information, I can't get through it all! 
<br>
I really want to improve my overall potential for a longer natural life.Anyone who has solid ideas on this PLEASE respond either on or off list.
<br>
Thanks!
<br>
