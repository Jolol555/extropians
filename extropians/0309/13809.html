<br>
<p><em>&gt;had questioned the breakage scenario and mentioned a possibility of:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Way bad idea. imagine a scenario where a space elevator were placed =
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;into GEO with an altitude of 36,000 km (22,369 miles).
</em><br>
<p>It could be a bad idea for other reasons too (I didn't read this
<br>
thread, but GEO caught my eye)
<br>
<p>Satellites break up in GEO regularly. These large pieces are
<br>
tracked and don't pose threats in general because their
<br>
filling factor in space is low. However drag is not a force
<br>
that can bring these objects down, so the GEO population is
<br>
only growing in time.
<br>
<p>In addition, the smaller (&lt;1cm) GEO debris population is not
<br>
known well because in-situ dust/debris detectors in GEO are
<br>
few/rare, remote sensing cannot detect the small particles,
<br>
and we don't have enough opportunities to bring back solar
<br>
panels and other surfaces of satellites to examine their
<br>
hypervelocity impact record.
<br>
<p>People (including me) are using what we can to learn about the
<br>
debris/dust population in GEO, but there's not enough
<br>
data. What we've learned so far are rough flux numbers and it
<br>
appears that debris and natural micrometeoroid number
<br>
densities are about the same. The charges and velocities and
<br>
masses of the tiny particles in GEO are pretty uncertain
<br>
though. The GORID detector, twin of Ulysses' dust detector,
<br>
which piggybacked on a Russian telecommunications satellite
<br>
for 6 years, is likely our best data set for a while (it was
<br>
turned off one year ago). The data is being analyzed in detail
<br>
now.
<br>
<p>I hope also those people that are looking at GEO for space
<br>
elevators are up to speed on their Earth's magnetosphere
<br>
physics.
<br>
<p>GEO tends to skim the inner boundary of the plasma sheet, and
<br>
the radiation belts and ring current are located near GEO, as
<br>
well.  During solar quiet times, the bodies orbiting at this
<br>
location are typically at dipolar-like field lines. During
<br>
large magnetic storms, the bodies orbiting at GEO are within
<br>
stretched field lines. It can be a very energetic place.
