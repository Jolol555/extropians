<p>I think two things got muddied together through some fault in my wording.  I 
<br>
was attempting to say that an important part of Intelligence Augmentation is 
<br>
to learn to discuss even difficult and highly emotionally vested subjects 
<br>
rationally and in a civilized manner.  Else those parts of our intelligence 
<br>
that are highly emotionally overlaid either will not be easy to augment or 
<br>
perhaps will be unsafe to augment because we amplify the range of our 
<br>
irrational emotions.    A part of Intelligence Augmentation is increasing the 
<br>
effectiveness and extent of our shared understanding and pooling of 
<br>
knowledge, talents and insights.  If we are unable to get beyond our 
<br>
emotional baggage sufficiently that part of IA will be seriously limited.
