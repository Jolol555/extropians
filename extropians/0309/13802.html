<p>There are some (not insignificant number, I think) of sys
<br>
admins that hate this idea, because it generates more garbage
<br>
on the Net. I made the goof a few years ago of putting
<br>
DELETETHIS in the middle of my German email address, as I
<br>
thought it was polite way to tell people what to remove of my
<br>
email address in order to reply to me when I wrote on Usenet
<br>
groups. Unfortunately there is really a company with the
<br>
domain of 'deletethis.de', and they were getting the spam that
<br>
was originally directed at me. I should have checked about
<br>
that, first, and I didn't.
<br>
<p>Someone alerted me to the Germany sysadmin usenet group
<br>
discussing me, and one person was asking the group if his
<br>
company should fine me for manufacturing my email that way.
<br>
When I wrote them and said it was a simple mistake on my part;
<br>
I had a large web site with a lot of educational materials
<br>
that was getting harvested no matter what I did, they said
<br>
that creating an email address such as 'nospam...' was
<br>
*anti-social*  and I was making garbage on the Net.
<br>
<p>After that, I rarely write on Usenet now. I haven't decided
<br>
yet if I should remove my domain, however, since my eight year
<br>
domain is a tentacle into a space that is part of me too. It
<br>
would feel too strange to me, to not have it.
<br>
<p>The 'net has been a big disappointment for me, in general though.
