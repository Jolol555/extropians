<em>&gt; consider murder to be more importantly a crime against the State than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against an individual, weirdly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
This sort of thing used to be weird to me, until I noticed a pattern.
<br>
One cannot end one's own life legally.  One cannot modify one's own brain
<br>
or body chemistry without formal permission from the state.  One cannot
<br>
legally sell the sexual services of one's body to another private party
<br>
(except in narrow and, again, state-approved circumstances).
<br>
<p>It boils down to the simple fact that the state considers the biological
<br>
bodies of its citizens to be its property.  You don't own your body or
<br>
brain, as far as (as far as I know) any modern state-entity (of which
<br>
you might be a citizen) is concerned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Therefore, when I suggest the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; abolition of that entire class of crimes, I don't mean that every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime in the class should be likewise abolished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
This seems nonsensical to me.  &quot;When I suggest the abolition of an
<br>
entire class of crimes, I don't mean that every crime in the class should
<br>
be abolished.&quot;  I don't understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we remove this obfuscation of offenses, so that all offenses are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against an individual or group of individuals, it's clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removing liability without the express consent of those who would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise be able to collect damages is simply legalization of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggression.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Huh, that's interesting.  The problem that I see is that negotiating
<br>
limitations of liability on a per-relationship or, worse, situational
<br>
basis would make a market economy logistically prohibitive.  There has
<br>
to be some body of consensus about what patterns liability limitations
<br>
generally fall into, so that one can pull the appropriate boilerplate
<br>
language on cue and move directly into a transaction.  State and federal
<br>
contract and corporate law seems to be our current best stab at this.
<br>
Most suggestions that I hear libertarian-types make for any systems to
<br>
supplant this seem pretty laughable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead of having a separate requirement for carrying insurance, why not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; let the managers/owners of the business itself choose whether to carry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such insurance?  Removing some market feedback mechanism (liability for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's actions, in this case) always seems to require one or more other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changes.  Each of these changes distort the market in other areas in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some (possibly small) way, which eventually look like &quot;market problems&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to politicians, who then campaign to fix them with more patches.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
The subject is liability limitation, not liability removal.  Right?
<br>
<p>And it seems like a fairly simple and obvious fact that, while it would be
<br>
NICE if we lived in a universe where everyone had the luxury of sufficient
<br>
time, knowledge, and mental capacity to evaluate all of their risk in
<br>
any investment or other situation, we don't, and we're never going to.
<br>
In order for there to be any non-institutional investment on any wide
<br>
scale, there has to be some repository of trust, however cobbled together.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If, instead, you just use a rule of &quot;one is responsible for one's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions&quot;, and rigorously enforce it, then exceptions which arise will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be purely voluntary and can be contract-based.  Liability cannot be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited by fiat, but it can be assumed by contract, which will often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the effect you want, above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
Again, I think this will lead to an established set of generally accepted
<br>
liability-limitation formulas, which is essentially what we have now.
<br>
When you see that my company's name is Brendan Coffey's Spiffy Con Job, LLC,
<br>
you know a great deal about what liability I (contractually) accept and refuse.
<br>
<p>If you don't like LLCs, don't do business with one.  I don't see that the
<br>
system you're (vaguely) describing would be functionally different.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;Abolishing LLC would change little in the economy, except for some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;names,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;decreased reliance on stock for funding, increases in reliance on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;credit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and maybe increased use of commercial insurance by businesses. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;non-professional investor would lose, and consumers would not gain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that a statement that little would change in the economy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is equivalent to a statement that you can centrally plan this aspect of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the economy, and by extension, all aspects which it touches.  I'm very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptical of this kind of statement, since I'm unaware of any clear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; examples of the success of economic central planning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
So, how do you feel that LLC is different from a subchapter S or C
<br>
corporation in its negative effect?  Should incorporation in general
<br>
be abolished?
<br>
