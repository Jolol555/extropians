<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Robbie Lindauer

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greg:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for taking the time.
</em><br>
<p>... a few more stolen moments give me a chance for another round.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can see that our sole point of difference comes down to whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or not &quot;In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Long Run&quot; we had to act now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This strikes me as an epistemological question
</em><br>
<p>In a sense, it very much is.  How much can we know about the future?  But
<br>
it's an epistemological question with a primarily moral dimension: In a
<br>
world of uncertainty, how much must we know before we can act?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - given two possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long-term future outcomes, couldn't several short-term options
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead to them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given that we don't know what's going to happen as a result of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our immediate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I know what the first part of this means -- I've read it
<br>
several times -- but I agree we can never know for certain what's going to
<br>
happen as the result of our actions in a system as complex as the world of
<br>
human events.
<br>
<p>[snip scenarios, all plausible]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Before we act, we don't really know which one is going to happen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Although
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we might have strong inclinations in one way or the other, we don't KNOW).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What we KNOW is that we have a CHOICE.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we have a choice, we are not being forced. If we were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Forced in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense, then we didn't have to bomb them, so we did it without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessity, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we both agreed, it was wrong to do so.
</em><br>
<p>I think where we're differing is in the meaning of &quot;forced.&quot;  I can be
<br>
&quot;forced&quot; to do something by my convictions, my moral princples.  Say I have
<br>
a friend, who is also my client.  I know he is going to commit a violent act
<br>
based on confidences he has placed in me as his attorney, and that the only
<br>
realistic way I have of stopping him is to reveal those confidences.  Am I
<br>
&quot;forced&quot; to do so?  In a physical sense of the word &quot;forced,&quot; no.  But in a
<br>
legal and moral sense, I am &quot;forced&quot; to do so, even though I may have very
<br>
mixed feelings about the matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think the only way out of this would be something like a certaintity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgement for:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We knew, before the fact, that the outcome would be better than all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible outcomes.
</em><br>
<p>Phrased this way, in the world of politics and international affairs, you
<br>
will always decide to not act, because the level of certainty isn't
<br>
achievable.  You've placed the burden of proof too high, in my opinion.  I
<br>
think this is precisely the same kind of rhetorical move that Luddites have
<br>
sought to do with the so-called &quot;Precationary Principle;&quot; they've stacked
<br>
the deck against action.
<br>
<p>Let me say that an advocate of action in an uncertain world takes a risk --
<br>
a risk of being wrong and, even more morally challenging, a risk of never
<br>
being able to know if she was *really* right at all.  I'm all for visitng
<br>
the consequences of the risk-taking on the actor.  You can't have your cake
<br>
and eat it too in the world of moral action: Ultimately you'll be judged by
<br>
history.  Yes, the moral actor can seem self-righteous: &quot;How *certain* you
<br>
seem!&quot; they say to the one who steps out ahead of the crowd.  And if the
<br>
consequences of the action ultimately end up being bad on balance, then that
<br>
judgment of bull-headed self-righteousness will have been correct. But
<br>
remember the judgment of Churchill in the 1930s -- most people saw him as a
<br>
grumbling crank.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I just don't see any evidence of any kind for that kind of proposition. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt that it can ever be produced unless you really are being forced and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone is genuinely amassing tanks at your borders.
</em><br>
<p>In this, you're being consistent: With the standard of moral certainty
<br>
you've set, one could not act until the tanks actually cross the border, I
<br>
would think.  After all, they may just be having a parade!
<br>
<p>Let me end by saying that I came to support the war in Iraq late and only
<br>
with great reluctance.  Nevertheless, I expect to be judged harshly by both
<br>
friend and foe if things go disasterously wrong.  Heck, I'll probably be
<br>
judged harshly no matter what!
<br>
