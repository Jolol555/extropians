</em><br>
<p>(diverging into another subject here)
<br>
<p>This is an interesting issue. Being very much into non-coercion
<br>
I don't consider either button acceptable at all; even changing 
<br>
the mind of one opponent this way would be wrong - while I agree 
<br>
that conserving memetic diversity is good, the right to one's mind 
<br>
is even more important (and in this case both are aligned). But at 
<br>
the same time I have no problems with the idea of debating and 
<br>
perhaps convincing a lot of opponents. So what makes these cases 
<br>
different? Is it just the &quot;unnatural means&quot; of the button?
<br>
<p>I think the key here is that we to a first approximation are the
<br>
rulers of our minds. We change our opinions based on the full
<br>
contents of our minds and not just the latest input, making it to a
<br>
large extent a voluntary action. If I refuse to accept a logical or
<br>
convincing argument (perhaps grasping at semantic or religious
<br>
straws or whatever) it is still my decision. Even when I am 
<br>
convinced gradually, without any real conscious awareness, that 
<br>
change is to a great extent based on the rest of my cognitive 
<br>
structure. Hence it can be said to be *my* decision, even if the 
<br>
conscious part of me was not highly involved.
<br>
<p>The above argument needs a lot of refining (like many other
<br>
arguments in the age of cognitive neuroscience) to deal with a more 
<br>
complex image of volition and integrity. But developing a better 
<br>
theory of when something is merely persuasion (acceptable) and when   
<br>
it is brainwashing (unacceptable) will be very helpful for much 
<br>
future debates and social thinking.
