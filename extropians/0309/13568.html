<p>At the root, irrationally violent behavior is motivated by fear. This is
<br>
true at the level of the leaders, who are afraid that what they control will
<br>
be taken away; and it's true at the level of the followers, each of whom
<br>
fears to be alone and longs to be part of something greater than himself.
<br>
This is more obvious in cases where people are fighting to keep invaders out
<br>
of their own lands. However, when leaders seek to expand the number of
<br>
square miles (or number of square blocks in the case of street gangs)  and
<br>
people they control, the motivation *at the root* is the same.
