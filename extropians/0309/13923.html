</em><br>
<p>Spreadsheets were on of the first places I missed fame.  In 1981 I was working 
<br>
as a tech for a bunch of Reservoir Engineers.  We had a nice little super 
<br>
computer simulating Prudhoe Bay holdings across a lot of wells over thousands 
<br>
of feet of depth (for some variables) over time.  But the output was a linear 
<br>
mess (tape only) that the engineers would work with from huge printouts using 
<br>
HP calculators.  Eventually it was more than I could take any more.  So I 
<br>
transferred the data to disk in a clever format that loaded quickly and built 
<br>
a pseudo-English formula engine for defining and computing formulas/data 
<br>
sets/&quot;cells&quot; if you like  and printing  and plotting them.   Various types of 
<br>
original and computed values had various dimensionality up to 4 dimensions.   
<br>
The underlying formula language was fairly sophisticated with around 200 
<br>
production rules in the LALR parser I had no choice but to hand-roll.  In 
<br>
normal spreadsheet manner the derived variables/data-sets would recalculate 
<br>
as any part of the underlying data or dependent defintions changed.  A rich 
<br>
set of scientific math fucntions was available and formulas could be defined 
<br>
on various slices and selections of the data matrices using all available 
<br>
mathematical functions and equations based on them.  Formulas/eqations were 
<br>
also named functions that could be used to derive other formulas. Too bad I 
<br>
wasn't paying attention to micros and didn't realize I had the makings of a 
<br>
multi-dimensional spreadsheet in hand at a time when a dumb 2-d data matrix 
<br>
was about to take the world by storm.   Ah well.   Impetuous youth.  I was 
<br>
too busy having fun with the shiny toys.
