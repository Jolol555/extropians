Given a network connection - it's easy to put a tap on the line that picks 
<br>
up every packet passing in both directions.  Once a packet is received, it 
<br>
can be processed for content or routed to a human operator for examination, 
<br>
or simply saved for later download. The tap adds no significant delay, 
<br>
since it's not &quot;active&quot; and it affects all packets travelling on that 
<br>
channel. It's basically a parallel connection to the wires that adds a very 
<br>
small loading, but no time delay. A fiber optic link is harder to tap - 
<br>
would require a specialized coupler in series with the fiber or a buffer 
<br>
that converted fiber to wire and back again, but it's not something really 
<br>
hard to do, and this method adds only nanoseconds to the transport time.
<br>
<p>There are &quot;sniffer&quot; boxes available that simply tie into an unused network 
<br>
port, and could allow saving every packet on the network. Not difficult 
<br>
technically - the hard part would be making sense of all those packets, but 
<br>
it could be done using a supercomputer, or in parallel processors.
<br>
<p>Any network connection can be tapped at an ISP, at the dial-up modem or at 
<br>
the fiber coming into the switch. It takes a pretty fast computer to handle 
<br>
traffic on a fiber link, but these exist - and since they are only 
<br>
receiving and don't need to respond, the processor is actually loaded less 
<br>
than the switch's processor.
<br>
<p>I suppose you could put something into the ISP that re-routed only certain 
<br>
packets via address, or via content, but that seems like a lot more work 
<br>
and would add the very delays you are supposing. Much easier to tap, listen 
<br>
to everything, and only &quot;save&quot; what's of interest. If they can read what's 
<br>
being sent, why should they give anyone a hint that they are doing so?
