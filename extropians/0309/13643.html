<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; But aren't something like 3/4 of all people in American jails in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; there for drug offenses?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From US Department of Justice:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict_c.htm#property">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict_c.htm#property</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Property crime makes up about three-quarters of all crime in the United
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So tagging everything would stop three-quarters of all crime!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can this be possible?!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I will go along with the idea that 3/4 of all crime in the USA is property 
<br>
crime. Here in Houston, it is very common for wretched teenagers to break car 
<br>
windows and steal stereos. Also, anything loose in the back of a truck is 
<br>
stolen posthaste.  However, virtually NOTHING is done about these crimes.  
<br>
The police will literally sneer at you if you ask about catching them. And if 
<br>
you catch them and hold them at gunpoint until the police arrive, they just 
<br>
let them go (underage). I know, my neighbor did just that.
<br>
<p>However, the original statement said (or implied) that most of the people in 
<br>
PRISON were there for property crimes. Big difference between the percentage 
<br>
of crimes committed (teenagers stealing stereos) and the percentage of people 
<br>
in prison.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Again from US Department of Justice:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/prisons.htm">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/prisons.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Percent of sentenced State inmates
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most serious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offense        1995 	2001
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Total   	100% 	100%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Violent 	  47        49 	
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Property 	23 	  19 	
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Drug 	          22	    20 	
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Public-order 	9 	 11 	
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This says that property theft is only about 20% of the prison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population, but there is an analysis problem here. Many violent or drug
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prisoners probably committed thefts as well, but are analysed by their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most serious offense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Interesting. But I wonder about the numbers of prisoners in FEDERAL prisons.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt; Once criminals realize that tagging property means certain capture and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conviction, then violent robberies will stop also.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It all sounds rather useful to me.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, I like the idea. I think we ought to have GPS-enabled tracking 
<br>
devices on our proeprty AND on our persons. And video cameras everywhere. And 
<br>
national ID cards. I think it would greatly enhance our quality of life.
