<br>
<em>&gt;The book also figures in (slight spoiler) Umberto Eco's _Name of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Rose_, where it is discussed. Most likely Eco knew about the medieval
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rumors and played with them for his story (very well worth reading).
</em><br>
<p>Eco's book is what got me started. I finished it last week, noting a
<br>
number of synchronicity events with other novels I've read in the
<br>
last few months (for example: J.L. Borges, Labyrinths), and a
<br>
longtime interest in comedy / humor theories and stories. I had a
<br>
picture in my mind while reading the novel, too, of a medieval
<br>
monastery called Maulbronn, in southern Germany, which I visited
<br>
when I first moved to Germany in 1998. Apparently the filming of the
<br>
movie was there, even though Eco's novel places it in Northern
<br>
Italy. The Maulbronn monastery is a very interesting, lovely place
<br>
(and they produce a fine wine: &quot;Five Fingers Wine&quot;.. ask me
<br>
sometime why they named their wine with that name).
<br>
<p>Eco's book is *marvelous*. It's about twenty years old now, that is
<br>
why I wondering if anything has developed during these last two
<br>
decades regarding the Aristotle 'lost' book idea.
<br>
<p><p>(from _Name of the Rose_, pg. 491)
<br>
<p>&quot;Perhaps the second book of Aristotle really did teach how to distort
<br>
the face of every truth, so that we would not become slaves of our
<br>
ghosts. Perhaps the mission of those who love mankind is to make
<br>
people laugh at the truth, to make truth laugh, because the only
<br>
truth lies in learning to free ourselves from insane passion for the
<br>
truth.&quot;
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
<p>from _Name of the Rose_, Pg. 473-7
<br>
<p>&quot;'But what frightened you in this discussion of laughter? You cannot
<br>
eliminate laughter by eliminating the book.'
<br>
<p>'No, to be sure. [...] But here, here... the function of laughter is
<br>
reversed, it is elevated to art, the doors of the world of the
<br>
learned are opened to it, it becomes the object of philosophy, and
<br>
of perfidious theology [...] Laughter frees the villein from fear of
<br>
the Devil, because in the feast of fools the Devil also appears poor
<br>
and foolish, and therefore controllable. But this book could teach
<br>
that freeing oneself of the fear of the Devil is wisdom. When he
<br>
laughs, as the wine gurgles in his throat, the villein feels he is
<br>
master, because he has overturned his position with respect to his
<br>
lord; but this book could teach learned men the clever and, from
<br>
that moment, illustrious artifices that could legitimatize the
<br>
reversal. Then what in the villein is still, fortunately, an
<br>
operation of the belly would be transformed into an operation of the
<br>
brain. [...] This book could strike the Luciferine spark that would
<br>
set a new fire to the whole world, and laughter would be defined as
<br>
the new art, unknown even to Prometheus, for canceling fear. [...]'
<br>
<p>'You are the Devil.'
<br>
<p>'I?'
<br>
<p>'Yes. They lied to you. The Devil is not the Prince of Matter; the
<br>
Devil is the arrogance of the spirit, faith without smile, truth
<br>
that is never seized by doubt. [...]
<br>
<p>'This book would have justified the idea that the tongue of the
<br>
simple is the vehicle of wisdom. This had to be prevented, which I
<br>
have done. You say I am the Devil, but it is not true: I have been
<br>
the hand of God.'
