</em><br>
<p>I'm fairly certain that we are. Human societies have the ability of
<br>
inventing new, previously meaningless jobs to keep people employed.
<br>
<p>As technology advances, more and more people are kicked out of farms and
<br>
industry, thanks to the better automation. Most of those people, until
<br>
today, found jobs in the service industry.
<br>
<p>Now, the service industry is about to be automated away much like the
<br>
factories: as AI gets better and better, previously intellectual-like
<br>
tasks get targeted for replacement by a computer.
<br>
<p>What people do then? Look around you - our society is supporting lots of
<br>
people who are &quot;working&quot; without producing anything tangible: athletes,
<br>
actors, artists, musicians. They have always existed, but now their
<br>
numbers are much higher than before. What they produce? Entertainment. Why
<br>
are they paid for that? Because well fed people, free from the quest for
<br>
next day's lunch, will seek entertainment. Someone will find it doing
<br>
something, someone else watching something. Most people will be a
<br>
combination of the two:  they will pay to watch a good show, and be paid
<br>
to make theirs. I use the word &quot;show&quot; in a very broad sense here:
<br>
researchers and inventors fall in the same category, but I fear that good
<br>
enough AI will replace them too :-)
<br>
<p>The change from a &quot;worker-consumer&quot; society to a &quot;showman-spectator&quot; one
<br>
will not take change until most material needs will be satisfied for a
<br>
negligible amount of money (or whatever equivalent comes out). I think
<br>
nothing short of advanced nanotech can satisfy that requirement, so it's
<br>
still quite far from us. But the first signs are already here.
<br>
<p>Ciao,
