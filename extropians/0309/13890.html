<em>&gt;-----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From: Behalf Of Robbie Lindauer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; If it is zero sum, there must be a winner and a loser.  Are you a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; loser merely because I would not do the welding for no trade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whatsoever?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Neither loses or gains.  I guess I misunderstood your question.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Zero Sum&quot; means that the sum adds up to zero, there is a winner and a
<br>
loser.  Basketball games are zero sum, both teams can not be winners.
<br>
Non zero sum means both parties can be winners, though one may not when
<br>
as much as the other, they both come out on top.  The classic example of
<br>
this is the prisoners dilemma game, in which two people are accused of a
<br>
crime, if either defects they get off scott free, but the other gets a
<br>
stiff sentence.  However, if they both cooperate, they both get off with
<br>
light sentances.  These exchanges exist throughout nature, in the way
<br>
animals share food (vampire bats, for instance) and the way individuals
<br>
trade goods.  Non-zero sum models accurate predict all of these systems,
<br>
they are certainly no zero sums.  I suggest reading Matt Ridley's &quot;The
<br>
Origins of Virtue&quot;  
<br>
<p>When you say 'niether loses nor gains' is that an objective statement of
<br>
fact?  What are they not 'losing' nor 'gaining'?  If I trade my skill
<br>
for yours, I feel I have won something, since otherwise I would have had
<br>
to spend years training at said skill.  This is the inherient value of
<br>
money, it is a representation of man-hours worked or intellegint human
<br>
effort.  You seem to imply absolutely that no one loses or gains, while
<br>
I feel I do win out, and so does the other party.  If the other party
<br>
agrees, are you stating that we are both wrong and just diluded?  Or is
<br>
your 'niether loses or gains' statement purely an opinion?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; Effort?  As in what, physical labor?  Calories expended?  What about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people who sit in front of a computer all day processing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;information, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; turning not so valuable information into more valuable information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Does this not demonstrate that 'effort' as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; directed through technology has no limit to its value?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Each person should be able to determine the value of their own time.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's what freedom is.
</em><br>
<p>You did not answer the question.  Is their a limit to value that
<br>
technology produces?  
<br>
<p>And why is freedom the ability to determine the *value* of your time,
<br>
and not just what to *do* with your time?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you say &quot;I'll give you a dollar to play guitar for me for an hour.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I might do it, I might not.  Depends on how I feel, if I'm free, etc.
</em><br>
<p>If you say &quot;Ill give you a dollar for that loaf of bread&quot; and I might do
<br>
it or might not, perhaps I consider my effort put into that loaf of
<br>
bread as worth more than a dollar.  I did, after all, grow the wheat,
<br>
grind thr flour, raise the cows for the milk, mix the concoction, and
<br>
the burn the coal required to heat it up.  You think Ill sell that for a
<br>
dollar?
<br>
<p>This is the fundamental contradiction in your stance, you state both at
<br>
the same time that &quot;each person should be able to determine the value of
<br>
their own time&quot; and in the next statement...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't.  I don't subscribe to the &quot;commodity&quot; supply and demand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;theory.  I said so above - value is given by human effort.  
</em><br>
<p>Which is it, is value determined by the effort, or by how much person
<br>
thinks is own time is worth?  How are you measuring 'value'? (hence my
<br>
comments on calories expended)
<br>
<p>Additionally, should I give you a dollar for your guitar playing, you
<br>
still do not consider yourself to have 'won' nor 'loss'  You have a
<br>
dollar where before you did not.  What if a million people gave you a
<br>
dollar to all hear you play your guitar for a minute.  What did you
<br>
lose?  A few calories moving those fingers around perhaps, but you
<br>
gained 1 million dollars.  Conversely, your audience each lost one
<br>
dollar, but they also got to hear some good classical guitar music
<br>
(hopefully) which some have though may have been barely worth a dollar,
<br>
but other may have been willing to pay five dollars, or ten, to hear the
<br>
sounds produced by your wiggling fingers on a piece of wood with some
<br>
strings.  Did they not 'win' out also?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; After all, if what you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; said above were true, I wouldn't be paying $8.95 for a BLT in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Westwood
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Why not?  If you can make a BLT cheaper, start your own BLT joint.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Efficient markets&quot;  If the theory is that food is becoming more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;available with time, it SHOULD follow that it would become less 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;expensive with time too, right?
</em><br>
<p>It has, it is cheaper than it has ever been before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I pay the $8.95 because even though I know I could buy a baby-pig for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;$8.95 and raise to a 1000-pound pig for around $100, enough to make 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about 5-10,000 BLT's (really hammy-ones), I don't because the trouble 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of dealing with it is worth paying for - that's the human effort part.
</em><br>
<p>Did you say 'worth' paying for?  But I thought you didn't win out?
<br>
Seems like, for a mere $8.95 you are paying someone else to raise smelly
<br>
pigs, the corn to feed them, a farm full of letuce, a farm of tomato,
<br>
the fertilizer and the equipment to cultivate those, and bread (maybe
<br>
some mayo) Yet the cost of this effort just happens to coincide exactly
<br>
with what you would pay for it as an even exchange?  If you think $9 is
<br>
to high, what if it was $.9 dollars?  Maybe you were willing to pay $2,
<br>
but can get it for less than one.  Is there still no 'winner' or 'loser'
<br>
Maybe that grocer would have still made extra money if they sold it for
<br>
50cents, but they got almost a buck out of you.  They are happier than
<br>
they were before, and you would have paid twice as much, so you are
<br>
happier.  Is this not a non-zero sum interaction!?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Ok, your libertarian descriptions fit me as well, yet I certainly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wouldn't call myself a 'peacefull anarchist' (how do you propose it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; remain 'peacefull' anarchy, btw?)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I trust people who own big guns to not f-with other people who own big 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guns.
</em><br>
<p>Great, so who ever has bigger guns wins out.  And why do you call this
<br>
'peacefull' anarchy exactly?  And how is this any better than the
<br>
current post-industrialize west system?  Do you not think a local
<br>
warlord pointing a gun at your face to take some of your food you grew
<br>
on your farm is 'alienation of labor'?  I don't exactly want to maintain
<br>
an arsenal, can I pay someone else to do it and ensure no one threatens
<br>
me with their aresenal?  Isnt that, in a way, what I am all ready doing
<br>
with my taxes?  After all, if someone comes up to me with a gun, I call
<br>
those people I pay, and they are hear to drag off the gun toting nut and
<br>
keep him, basically, from f-ing with me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; But I would like to hear more of what kind of system you would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; propose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(I hope) I'll know paradise when I get there.  Until then I'll just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;complain :)
</em><br>
<p>That's fine, but what if the system you are proposing is worse.  And it
<br>
kills millions of people.  What if the system you are rallying most
<br>
against is what will bring the world to the closest it can possibly get
<br>
to an ideal world free of force?  How are you determining, objectively,
<br>
what is the best way to persue such a goal.  How are you determining,
<br>
objectively, that your goal will indeed be better, and it wont kill most
<br>
of its inhabitants.  I am sure Pol Pot thought his goals laudable, but
<br>
1/3rd of the Cambodia population paid the price with their phsyical
<br>
lives, and the rest paid with their emotional lives.  It seems like you
<br>
are just doing a lot of complaining, without looking at the consequences
<br>
of your suggestions.  It also sounds like you are more like a social
<br>
anarchist then a 'peaceful anarchist'
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Does your peacefull Anarchist society have property rights?  Who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; enforces them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Me, you, them.  If, as you say, there's plenty of food, land 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and water, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;there shouldn't be any problem.
</em><br>
<p>So we do have property rights then?  Well, what if I want more property
<br>
than you think I should have?  Is that when we whip out the big guns and
<br>
enforce that 'peacefull anarachy'?  I said there is plenty of water and
<br>
food, not land.  I do feel there is plenty of land, but there are more
<br>
and more restrictions on land use, this issue of reason magazine relays
<br>
that the number of regulations on land has increased 80% in the last
<br>
decade.  Some cities and towns in the US have regulations on what
<br>
structures must *look* like.  This and many other factors contribute to
<br>
the increase in the cost of land.  But the population growth rates are
<br>
slowing as the world industrializes, most post industrial nations have
<br>
zero or less than zero birth rates, and as societies get wealthier and
<br>
more concerned with individualistic goals, that trend will only
<br>
accelerate.  
<br>
<p>But regardless, there may be plenty of food and water, but since we all
<br>
have property rights, what if I buy up most of the food production land
<br>
and charge what I want for the food.  Does a gang of 'peacefull
<br>
anarchists' come beating down my fences with machine guns and iron bars?
<br>
You acknowledge that some people will not want to farm (I certainly do
<br>
not) perhaps they'll sell their arable land to me, and I'll form a large
<br>
industrialized agrictultural base, then sell the food back to them.
<br>
They will be free from the labor of farming, and I'll be free from the
<br>
labor of building cars, houses, telephones, etc etc etc.  
<br>
<p>Um, how is this any different then the current market based system?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;People would have to recognize the value of what they'd achieved to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;make it worth keeping.
</em><br>
<p>And if they do not recognize the value of what they achieved, what then?
<br>
Is it not worth keeping.  What if others recognize the value, but the
<br>
producer does not, even though he continues to produce and others
<br>
continue to consume.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Do they have a right to take my provisions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That's an ethical issue, not a legal one.  They have no right to steal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from you, but you SHOULD share with them if you can, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;would be &quot;The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;right thing to do.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>And what if I do not share with them?  As I said, it's a hard winter
<br>
coming up, and I prepared for it.  They wasted away their productive
<br>
summer nights drinking and playing cards at the saloon.  This winter,
<br>
they stand to starve or freeze, I and my family will do neither.
<br>
However, should we divide up my provisions, perhaps some 50% of them
<br>
would not starve or freeze, but 50% of my family would.  What is the
<br>
'right thing to do'?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Who forces the Doctor to treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; my ailments to achieve 'adequate' health care?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Assuming you've been nice to your doctor, why wouldn't he be nice to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you?
</em><br>
<p>Maybe, maybe he is sick of performing brain operations.  Or maybe he
<br>
only became a doctor because his dad wanted him to, and now that he can
<br>
survive without have to perform brain surgeries, he is perfectly content
<br>
to sculpt clay instead of perform operations.  What then?
<br>
<p>The more something is valued by more people, the higher people are paid
<br>
to perform that service, and the more likely people are to perform that
<br>
service.  
<br>
<p>I do not understand how you could say something like the above, yet
<br>
previously say:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;If you say &quot;I'll give you a dollar to play guitar for me for an hour.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I might do it, I might not.  Depends on how I feel, if I'm free, etc.
</em><br>
<p>And not realize the contradiction.  How about 'I'll give you a dollar to
<br>
perform that brain surgery' He might do it, he might not.  Depends on
<br>
how he feels, right?  He's free, after all.  Of course, I'll die, but he
<br>
is free!  You also say &quot;Each person should be able to determine the
<br>
value of their own time&quot; Perhaps the good doctor feels his time is
<br>
valued at 1 million dollars per second of operation time.  He is, after
<br>
all, free to determine the value of his time, is he not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Especially If I can not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; pay him, and no government exists to coerce him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;He should help you.  The Government isn't exactly helping right now.
</em><br>
<p>But what if he does not want to help me?  I hear lots of 'shoulds' and
<br>
'it's the right thing to do' but no concrete answers to problems.  And
<br>
Sure the government is helping, we have no shortage of brain surgeons.
<br>
The system, kept in place (for the most part) by governments, helps to
<br>
ensure that money is a representation of effort or man-hours worked and
<br>
has value, that no one with a big gun will hold you up and take all your
<br>
bread, and that worth is determined by the consumer and the producer in
<br>
competition, yet both benefit.  You insit that worth should be
<br>
determined solely by the producer E.g. &quot;Each person should be able to
<br>
determine the value of their own time&quot; and seem to suggest that value as
<br>
determined by an interaction of consumer and producer leads both to be
<br>
'unfree'
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Shall my best friend
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just hold a gun to his head?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;How about asking nicely, most people are reasonable when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;asked.  
</em><br>
<p>What about the people who are not reasonable?
<br>
<p>If the 
<br>
<em>&gt;doctor knows that he can't extract unreasonable fees for his services, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then he will ask for reasonable fees.  
</em><br>
<p>But I thought you said &quot;Each person should be able to determine the
<br>
value of their own time&quot;  What if the value of his time is an
<br>
unreasonable fee to me?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If a doctor becomes known as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;That guy who cheats dying people&quot; then his business would dry up 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pretty quick I imagine.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, so if he charges more than people are willing to pay, he will go out
<br>
of business!!!  Robbie, how is this *any* different than a market based
<br>
capitalism?  Your statement above directly contradicts the idea of
<br>
determining the value of your own time freely.  The two can not
<br>
co-exist.  They are a logical contradiction, you can not have A and
<br>
not-A simaltaneously.  Either he determines the value of his time, or
<br>
all the parties involved determine the value (the producers and the
<br>
consumers)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (Oh, right, you said a 'peacefull
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; anrachist', I suppose Ill just ask him politely to perform required
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; operation)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sounds good, but I'd expect you to have planned well enough that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;could pay a reasonable fee and/or contracted with some insurer. 
</em><br>
<p>And what if I did not?  A significant majority of the population does
<br>
not 'plan well enough' for such things, yet society generally expects
<br>
them to receive the same 'adequate' health care that others who do plan
<br>
well enough receive.  Who forces the Doctor to perform the operation
<br>
when there is no government that collects taxes or insists employers
<br>
give employees health benefits if working full time, in effect forcing
<br>
the masses, despite their stupidity, to prepare for such things.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(Who 
<br>
<em>&gt;in turn would pay because if they didn't you'd be pissed and so would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the rest of their customers.)
</em><br>
<p>An insurer would pay because I would be pissed?  What if they had bigger
<br>
guns than me?  Would they care if I were pissed?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   Truthfully, I don't understand how this system could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;possibly exist, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; unless each and every person in it is immortal, perpetually healthy, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and always with shelter and food.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Maybe.  Maybe not.  I say it's worth a try because THIS isn't working.
</em><br>
<p>The system you propose is basically what we have in place in most post
<br>
industrilized west nations, barring the existence of the things most
<br>
minarchist liberterians generally object to (drug war, subsidies,
<br>
intereference of business by government, etc)  Seems you should just be
<br>
a minarchist libertarian, and move to new hampshire with the rest of us
<br>
in a year or two.
<br>
<p>'THIS' isnt perfect, but it's the best thing we have seen so far, and I
<br>
fear your sytem would be far far worse. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Is that so?  I guess most communist governements just never 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;got to sit 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; around long enough to turn into full anarachies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's an empirical question and so I am agnostic about it.  
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  You are agnostic about empirical questions?
<br>
<p>The Chinese 
<br>
<em>&gt;government, if it's Communist, has an opportunity to become a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;government-less body.  I doubt that they will, personally.  
</em><br>
<p>They show no trends suggesting their political structure will change.
<br>
They remain as closed as possible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; How does peaceful anarachy alleviate global poverty?  (food, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;shelter, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and adequate health care)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;By letting people benefit from their own land and labor.
</em><br>
<p>In what cases to people not benefit from their labor?  The only case I
<br>
can think of is when people are not granted the fruits of their labor,
<br>
i.e. slavery.  Which doesn't exist anywhere anymore.  What if people
<br>
want to all sell their land because they don't want to farm, and buy
<br>
land on the water?  There is only so much land on the water, what if
<br>
everyone wants to move there?  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; What
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is 'forced alienation of our labor' and what about volunteer labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Forced alienation of our labor is TAXATION or other kinds of coerced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(in the broad sense of &quot;essentially forced&quot;) extraction of resources 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and time.
</em><br>
<p>But isnt being forced to charge a 'reasonable' fee, as in the case of
<br>
our Doctor, a form of coercion?  Isnt that why you consider it not being
<br>
free, and why you use the qualifier of &quot;Each person should be able to
<br>
determine the value of their own time&quot; instead of &quot;each person should be
<br>
able to determine what to *do* with their time&quot;  If I am forced to
<br>
charge less than what I think my services are worth, I am still
<br>
FORCED!!!  In the first possible example I give you of where someone
<br>
values his time differently than what others value you, you assert that
<br>
the value should be a reasonable interaction of those, this is exactly
<br>
what the supply and demand curves determine.  Pick up any intro to
<br>
business book, and replace 'supply' with 'how much one values his own
<br>
time' and replace 'demand' with 'how much others value your time' and
<br>
youll see the same thing.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; also note, we can not exist without labor, we must labor for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our food. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; How is that dichotomy settled?  Food will not fall from the sky and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; into your mouth, and with no government to provide it, where will it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; come from?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I expect a nice little farm might do the trick.  On the Kibutz groups 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of people come together to build farms that sustain them and then take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;turns on it.  That's ONE way.  Another way is just to farm your own 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;land.   Another way is to provide a sufficiently valuable service that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;other people would simply give you food.
</em><br>
<p>So you play the guitar, and I bring over some tomatoes?  Isnt that a
<br>
little inconvenient, how about I give you a piece of paper, or a gold
<br>
coin, that basically amounts to 12 tomatoes, and in exchange you play
<br>
your guitar.    Is it just the concept of money you don't like?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I know guitarists that make their livings this way, for instance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am sure they do, but do people give them coin, or do they give them
<br>
bread and tomatoes?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  If I chose to stop working,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I would lose my house.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not stop working, we are in agreement that you must produce to provide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for yourself.  Try stop paying taxes.
</em><br>
<p>Then who will protect me from the people with big guns?  What if I want
<br>
to pay for that protection service?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alienation simply means taking something that was yours and making it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;someone else's.  Forced alienation is when someone MAKES you do it.
</em><br>
<p>A perfect description of being forced to charge 'reasonable fees'  You
<br>
are taking somethning that isnt yours (my time, skills, and effort) and
<br>
making me give it to you for less than I think it is worth.  How do you
<br>
resolve this contradiction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;   I have little need for rock
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; throwers, but need computer programmers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;People manage to figure out valuable things that other people want. 
</em><br>
<p>But you said &quot;Each person should be able to determine the value of their
<br>
own time&quot;  Maybe I want to be a rock thrower, and I can throw them
<br>
really well, and I think it has a lot of value.  I do, after all, get to
<br>
determine the value of my own time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;They don't need governments to show them how to do this.  Governments 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;come in when small groups of people band together and force other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people into submission by violence.
</em><br>
<p>Oh, like being forced to charge a 'reasonable' fee?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Agreed, tentatively.  But are some governments 'less bad' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than others? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Say, for example, Pol Pot's Cambodia vs. Australia?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not clear.  
</em><br>
<p>NOT CLEAR!!!! Have you not seen the pictures of piles of skulls?  The
<br>
Tual Song prison camp, where 20,000 political prisoners went in and
<br>
SEVEN came out?  The official decrees to 'smash' dissenters and enemies
<br>
of the people?  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It may be that the underlying factors which support 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Australia also support Pol Pot.  
</em><br>
<p>But it isnt, since Australia's economy is not run by the will of one
<br>
individual who has absolute power.  The Khmer rouge executed anyone with
<br>
money, glasses, ability to speak multiple languages, doctors, etc. etc.
<br>
I suggest you read the Democide page's article on cambodia
<br>
<a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.CHAP6.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.CHAP6.HTM</a> 
<br>
<p>&quot;In proportion to its population, Cambodia underwent a human catastrophe
<br>
unequaled by any other country in the twentieth century (see Figure 1.2
<br>
of my Death By Government). It probably lost slightly less than
<br>
4,000,000 people to war, rebellion, manufactured famine, and
<br>
democide--genocide, nonjudicial executions, and massacres--or close to
<br>
56 percent of its 1970 population. Between 1970 and 1980, from democide
<br>
alone, successive governments and guerrilla groups murdered almost
<br>
3,300,000 men, women, and children, including 35,000 foreigners. Most of
<br>
these, probably as many as 2,400,000, were murdered by the communist
<br>
Khmer Rouge, both before and (to a much greater extent) when they took
<br>
over Cambodia after April 1975&quot;
<br>
<p>I understand that the CIA was funding 
<br>
<em>&gt;Pol Pot's campaign against his people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
You understand incorrectly.  But I wont dwell on this point, as it
<br>
deviates from the topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; No, but I don't see how any of the ideas you propose would make it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; objectively make it likely that you would live any longer.  Though I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; would certainly entertain any evidence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Number one killer in America for males over 30 (me) - Heart Disease.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Major cause of heart-disease - STRESS.  Major cause of stress - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overwork.
</em><br>
<p>Over-eating is a far larger cause of Heart Disease, and people over eat
<br>
because food is so damn cheap and consumer goods so inexpensive, leading
<br>
us to live more sedantary lives than ever before.  Plenty of people work
<br>
with No stress also, work does not absolutely cause stress.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Number 2 killer - Cancer.  Number 1 cause of cancer - unknown 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;environmental factors.  I personally attribute them to the pollutants 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;required by modern cities to keep the engines greased.
</em><br>
<p>As Damien has addressed this, I'll pass.  But suffuce to say, in this
<br>
example your hunch is entirely wrong.  The most predominant cause of
<br>
cancer is diet, which is again because food is so damn cheap.  And of
<br>
course, these killers are only killers in the post industrial west,
<br>
someone in Burma, for example, could only hope to worry about dying from
<br>
cancer, since they'll never get enough food or live to old age to worry
<br>
about it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; As Gorby pointed out in the late 80's, Singapore generated
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; more wealth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; than the ENTIRE Soviet Union.  But it must have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because it was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; exploiting the working man, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Without any doubt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Did the people of singapore live better lives than the people of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; soviet union?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which people?
</em><br>
<p>All the people, as an average, both the mean and the median.  Did they
<br>
live better lives or not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I hear Gorby had a really, really nice limousine.  Maybe there were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;more really-really-nice limousines per capita in Singapore 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;than Russia, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I don't know.
</em><br>
<p>Can you think of any way to measure the quality of life besides
<br>
'limosuines per capita'?
<br>
