<p>4/9 is correct.

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>To see why you didn't need to brute-force it, try calculating the
<br>
probability that the third chip was white given that the first chip was
<br>
white, or the probability that the first chip was white given that the
<br>
second chip was white.  Also 4/9.
<br>
<p>In fact, for any j != k, p(Wj|Wk) == 4/9, provided that the only other 
<br>
information given is as described above.  So if we knew only that the 
<br>
sixty-seventh chip was white, we would estimate a 4/9 probability that the 
<br>
twenty-third chip was white.
<br>
<p>Since all bowls of this kind possess this symmetry, we can find the 
<br>
constant for any particular bowl by estimating the probability that the 
<br>
second chip was white, given that the first chip was white.  If we got a 
<br>
white chip on the first round, we would add one white chip for the second 
<br>
round, making the probability of a white chip 4/9.  This is then the same 
<br>
as the probability that a white chip was drawn on the second round, given 
<br>
that a white chip was drawn on the fourth round.
