<p>And that &quot;increase in numbers&quot; is a big part of the problem.  Not the 
<br>
only part, but a big part.  I don't see any easy answers.  But I'm 
<br>
reminded of the fur statistics from the Hudson Bay Company on Canadian 
<br>
Lynx populations.  They would periodically peak, and then crash.  Hard. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the depletion of the resources (rabbits, I believe) on 
<br>
which they depended.  And the rabbit population went through a similar 
<br>
cycle, but offset in time by 6 mo.s to a year (I forget exactly).  They 
<br>
crashed because diseases became widespread.  We *must* control the 
<br>
population, but we don't want to.  Some governments try very hard, 
<br>
China, e.g., and, to a much lesser extent, India.  Others refuse to even 
<br>
accept the need (the US comes to mind, and the Catholic church).
<br>
If the population could be evenly decimated, many of the current ills 
<br>
would vanish.  But imagine the trauma of a global disease that killed 9 
<br>
out of 10 people!  Control of the population growth, sending it way 
<br>
negative, is the optimal choice, but even that moderate step would have 
<br>
immense negative consequences.  As the population aged there would be 
<br>
fewer young people which would mean that social policies would become 
<br>
inflexible.  Schools wouldn't be properly supported (well, they aren't 
<br>
now, so that's not much change) becase so few were parents.  Etc.  Of 
<br>
course, this might cause the age of retirement to be pushed further out, 
<br>
but it wouldn't necessarily have that result, as increasing automation 
<br>
is continuing to remove jobs.  But people need to be *trained* for the 
<br>
jobs that remain.  And many already so distrust the system (for valid 
<br>
historic reasons) that it would require tremendous efforts to convince 
<br>
them to give it another try.  Still, the change *WOULD* be slow, which 
<br>
is both it's benefit and it drawback.
<br>
<p>Note that policies that restrict parents to one child will have severe 
<br>
side-effects.  In China it's not uncommon for parents to abandon a child 
<br>
who is seen as defective, so that it can be replaced with one that may 
<br>
be better.  I am reminded of Larry Niven's world of the ARM and the 
<br>
birth-right lotteries.
<br>
<p>It starts to become crucial to project just how far away the singularity 
<br>
is.  The unpleasant side effects appear quickly, and the beneficial 
<br>
effects take many years to dominate (presuming that an unpopular 
<br>
practice can be maintained that long).  If the singularity is less than 
<br>
20 years away, perhaps the best choice is to try to &quot;muddle through&quot;. 
<br>
(Remembering that the ramp up in change rate before the sigularity will 
<br>
already be imposing huge social changes and stresses.)
<br>
<p>OTOH, &quot;No man knoweth the hour...&quot;.  The &quot;son of man&quot; may appear 
<br>
overnight.  It may appear as a distributed intelligence on the internet. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;We can hope that it will be as beneficient as we have dreamed, but if 
<br>
it appears in a fast takeoff mode, and isn't designed, then that will be 
<br>
&quot;gartuitous grace&quot;.  (Sorry for all the religious stuff in this 
<br>
paragraph, but that language really seems the best shorthand to consider 
<br>
fast takeoff AI in.  It *will* appear to be a miracle, whether of 
<br>
benevolent or malevolent nature.)
