<p>Basically you are saying that might makes right.

<p><em>&gt; Many will argue with the premise of &quot;two wrongs don't make a right&quot; but

</em><br>
<p>Not really relevant.

<p><em>&gt; I'm not saying we should just bust into any country we decide is &quot;bad&quot;, but

<p>Ah.  We should ask them to give up power completely and if the don't then they 
<br>
&quot;asked for it&quot; heh?    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What right have we? Every right in the world. We are protecting people to

<p>There are all manner of supposedly &quot;higher purposes&quot; in the world.  Which 
<br>
would you like enforced on you and yours?   Never mind, you don't have a 
<br>
choice.  You will be forced to serve whatever &quot;higher purpose&quot; appeals to 
<br>
whatever group has the most physical power.   Have a nice day.
