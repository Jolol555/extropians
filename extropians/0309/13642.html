The system chopped my last post - let's try again.

<p>That is true, but misses the point. It would be very easy to pass a law
<br>
that said that if you had any unregistered items in your possession or
<br>
in your home, then that would provide de facto evidence of suspicion of
<br>
theft. It would then be down to you to provide evidence that you had
<br>
come into possession of these items by legal means. And if you were able
<br>
to provide such evidence, then you would have to explain why you had
<br>
then committed the offense of failing to register these items in your
<br>
name.  Just as we have to do at present (in UK) for cars.
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>From this you may not be aware of the vehicle security devices that can
<br>
be built into the frame of luxury cars. Security vans have them also.
<br>
Some delivery vehicles and hire cars have them fitted as well.
<br>
It is virtually impossible to remove these devices without dismantling
<br>
the whole vehicle. And you can't wrap the whole car in tinfoil.
<br>
Search Google on - vehicle tracking - or - vehicle anti-theft GPS -.

<em>&gt;&gt; But aren't something like 3/4 of all people in American jails in

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>From US Department of Justice:
<br>
<a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict_c.htm#property">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/cvict_c.htm#property</a>
<br>
&quot;Property crime makes up about three-quarters of all crime in the United
<br>
States.&quot;
<br>
<p>So tagging everything would stop three-quarters of all crime!!!
<br>
Can this be possible?!
<br>
<p>Again from US Department of Justice:
<br>
<a href="http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/prisons.htm">http://www.ojp.usdoj.gov/bjs/prisons.htm</a>
<br>
<p>Percent of sentenced State inmates
<br>
Most serious
<br>
offense        1995 	2001
<br>
Total   	100% 	100%
<br>
Violent 	  47        49 	
<br>
Property 	23 	  19 	
<br>
Drug 	          22	    20 	
<br>
Public-order 	9 	 11 	
<br>
<p>This says that property theft is only about 20% of the prison
<br>
population, but there is an analysis problem here. Many violent or drug
<br>
prisoners probably committed thefts as well, but are analysed by their
<br>
most serious offense.
<br>
<p>Once criminals realize that tagging property means certain capture and
<br>
conviction, then violent robberies will stop also.
<br>
<p>It all sounds rather useful to me.
