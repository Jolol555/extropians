</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be blamed because obliged due to contract?
</em><br>
<p>### Of course.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, lacking any explicit agreement with my children about when I

</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge, I'm not to be ashamed or blamed?
</em><br>
<p>### Ashamed, perhaps. Blamed - well, it depends on the local customs
<br>
regarding the duties of guardians of prepersons. Such customs should be
<br>
sufficiently simple and well-known to allow expectations to form, and at the
<br>
same time they should be subject (largely) to choice, by both parents and
<br>
(to a lesser degree) their children, e.g. by the expedient of polycentric
<br>
law.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But we're very close.  There is a familial and filial contract
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implicit in human-being but state-enforced contracts almost always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arise as a result of coercion.  Similarly economic contracts tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be backed by force and coercion either explicitly or implicitly.
</em><br>
<p>### See medieval merchant law. Ostracism is not coercion, but is very
<br>
effective at enforcing many contracts.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;An
<br>
<em>&gt; example of an IMPLICIT form of coercion might be forcing people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take minimum wage jobs and drive three hours to their work because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's the only work available for them - and because the education
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system set up to provide them with necessary skills to either provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for themselves or get better jobs has utterly failed them, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparently deliberately.
</em><br>
<p>### This would not be coercion, unless you are talking about non-market,
<br>
monopoly situations - such as a communist economy, or a statist plutocracy.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ### It is not my prerogative to define other sentients'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; self-interest for them. I can however hypothesize that it is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; similar to mine, the achievement of whatever goals they act to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; achieve, ideally in the presence of sufficient information needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evaluate those goals in reference to other goals they strive for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Therefore, &quot;goodness&quot; is for me getting what humans really want, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the ideal society is the one that best serves the achievement of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; average Rawlsian human's goals, including my own personal goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Goodness is then defined in the context of my self-interest, not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; other way around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Getting what WHICH humans really want?  If your predictive statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Goodness is what tends to produce good results in the long-run&quot;
</em><br>
<p>### My statement goes &quot;Social goodness is whatever tends to get me and
<br>
others most of what I and they want&quot;. For most well-informed, low-emotional
<br>
persons this will mean absolute (not relative) economic success under
<br>
conditions of personal liberty.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Most People&quot; want to gain at other people's expense.  It's the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule of capitalism - buy low, sell high.  We can call this the modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent of original sin.
</em><br>
<p>### Nah, most people want to gain. Whether it occurs at other people's
<br>
expense, is a minor secondary consideration. In fact, with the exception of
<br>
egalitarians, who see the gain of others as an affront to themselves, and
<br>
would prefer to even personally lose if it's needed to ruin others, most
<br>
people would rather gain *and* profit others at the same time. It feels
<br>
better, I can tell you that.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Most People&quot; don't agree about what they want - shoot, most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't even know what they want themselves.  But just about EVERYBODY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can tell you whether or not you should torture children.  Good is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more concrete than this abstract &quot;what people want&quot; thing.
</em><br>
<p>### Certain procedures are good at finding out what people want. This
<br>
includes the free market, demarchy, Borda count and a few other tricks.
<br>
These define good much better than whatever you or I could elaborate on our
<br>
own. Nothing abstract about it.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Doubtful.  Calm rationality and long-term outlook has made this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; world the way it is NOW.  Is this the best world there can be? (in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; something more than a tautological sense.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Today's world the result of calm rationality and long-term
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; outlook?!!!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; You really meant it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Definitely.  On the part of a few very wealthy and powerful people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have had and continue to have extraordinary power.
</em><br>
<p>### This world is not made for and by elites. Masses of all kinds of humans
<br>
labored for centuries to build what we have, and AFAIK there are no
<br>
Illuminati, effective conspiracies, and worldwide cabals.
<br>
<p>I guess we differ here.
<br>
<p>No Elders of Zion, either.
