<p>Both of them are losing exactly 1 hour each.  Two hours total.   That's 
<br>
the objective facts of it.  The subjective fact &quot;Did they enjoy their

negotiable.

<p>A person can learn to love even the most awkward drudgery.

<p>Not if you give up something of equal value - your 1 hour.  You may 
<br>
have the subjective feeling of &quot;pheew&quot; but you haven't actually gained 
<br>
anything, you've lost your hour.  It was an hour very efficiently 
<br>
spent, but still an hour of your life, gone, dusted, forever lost to 
<br>
memory and wistfulness, spent performing menial labor, something you've 
<br>
done a thousand times before.
<br>
<p>MAYBE it would be more fun and interesting to learn other people's 
<br>
trades?  That is a subjective factor.  You can spend your time how you 
<br>
like.  But you can never gain any more of it, and it is that TIME that 
<br>
is valuable to You, Me and your cohorts.  That's why you're willing to 
<br>
make the trade - you can save some time by spending some time.
<br>
<p>But the fact is, you didn't actually save time, you only spent it.  So 
<br>
did your other person.
<br>
<p>Consider the possibility that you didn't NEED their help.  Consider the 
<br>
possibility that even though it would take you YEARS to get as good at

doing what they're doing that those years might be a lot of fun!  Even

Pig-Farming can be fun.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the inherient value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money, it is a representation of man-hours worked or intellegint human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effort.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps a better way of putting it is that money can be artificially 
<br>
inflated so that the people who print money and control the money 
<br>
supply can always maintain an upper-hand in monetary exchanges, making 
<br>
the value of money arbitrary - that is, it is the main value of money 
<br>
that its value be changeable over time so that my hour today can be 
<br>
devalued to 1/2 hour in 10 years or 2-years depending on how quickly 
<br>
inflation &quot;happens&quot; - or more accurately, on how fast the money supply 
<br>
is changed by those who control it  - in particular:

<br>
<p><em>&gt; You seem to imply absolutely that no one loses or gains, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I feel I do win out, and so does the other party.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, you've got what you wanted, he got what he wanted.  On the other 
<br>
hand, you had to do something you (let's assume) didn't want to do and 
<br>
so did he.  The exchange, has no net creation of time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the other party
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agrees, are you stating that we are both wrong and just diluded?  Or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your 'niether loses or gains' statement purely an opinion?
</em><br>
<p>It's a statement about what is valuable in exchanges.  The answer is 
<br>
human effort, time.  Of course there are subjective factors that say 
<br>
whether or not your &quot;time is well spent&quot; but the objective factor is 
<br>
the simple expense of your human labor doing something for someone else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Does this not demonstrate that 'effort' as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; directed through technology has no limit to its value?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Each person should be able to determine the value of their own time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; That's what freedom is.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You did not answer the question.  Is their a limit to value that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology produces?
</em><br>
<p>the question is badly formed.  If there were a machine that could 
<br>
convert solar energy to hamburgers, that machine would be really, 
<br>
really great to have.  It's value, however, would be determined by how 
<br>
hard it would be for me to acquire it and/or the hamburgers it creates. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be determined by the amount of effort I had to put in to 
<br>
get them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And why is freedom the ability to determine the *value* of your time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not just what to *do* with your time?
</em><br>
<p>Because if I am free, I can charge $3000/hr for my time.  If I am not, 
<br>
I can be forced to do something for less.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; If you say &quot;I'll give you a dollar to play guitar for me for an hour.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; If you say &quot;Ill give you a dollar for that loaf of bread&quot; and I might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it or might not, perhaps I consider my effort put into that loaf of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bread as worth more than a dollar. ...You think Ill sell that for a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollar?
</em><br>
<p>The cases are exactly parallel - the bread and the guitar-playing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is the fundamental contradiction in your stance, you state both at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same time that &quot;each person should be able to determine the value 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their own time&quot; and in the next statement...
</em><br>
<p>Oooh, I'm excited!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which is it, is value determined by the effort, or by how much person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinks is own time is worth?  How are you measuring 'value'? (hence my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments on calories expended)
</em><br>
<p>By the subjective factor by which a person values their own time.  No 
<br>
dichotomy here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  What if a million people gave you a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollar to all hear you play your guitar for a minute.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on what I have to play.  If I have to play &quot;Come Mr. Tally-man 
<br>
Tally-me-bannana&quot; I (may have) lost my self-respect and my minute.
<br>
<p>On the other hand if I just plain WANTED to play what I happened to be 
<br>
playing and someone wanted to give me money for it, we still have a 
<br>
zero-sum, to use your terminology.  Money is of variable value.  If 
<br>
people are making &quot;average&quot; guitar-players millionaires in 1-minute, 
<br>
then a million dollars isn't worth that much, is it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Did they not 'win' out also?
</em><br>
<p>Again, if they do it &quot;OF THEIR OWN WILL&quot; that is, if they do it for 
<br>
themselves, then sure, they have spent their time the way they wanted 
<br>
to, they're free, they win - they simply did what they wanted with 
<br>
their time.
<br>
<p>Maybe I did too.  But the objective factor - how much time  - we both 
<br>
lost exactly the same amount.  Tick Tick Tick.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Efficient markets&quot;  If the theory is that food is becoming more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; available with time, it SHOULD follow that it would become less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; expensive with time too, right?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It has, it is cheaper than it has ever been before.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I for one know that in 1991 I could get a nice BLT in westwood 
<br>
for $5.95.  Now it's $8.95.  That's not cheaper.  What standard are you 
<br>
using for &quot;cheaper&quot;.  Even by my standard - time - I still have to walk 
<br>
over to the restaurant, sit down, ask.  That person has to go order, 
<br>
get, have made and bring it to me.  You can see why I prefer to measure 
<br>
by time - it manages to transcend epochal and cultural distinctions of 
<br>
value ( but not religious or moral distinctions of value - the 
<br>
Religious or Ethical person doesn't care how long it takes to do the 
<br>
right thing.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Did you say 'worth' paying for?  But I thought you didn't win out?
</em><br>
<p>I said there was a tie - we both lose the exact same amount of the only 
<br>
thing worthwhile - the TIME.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Is this not a non-zero sum interaction!?
</em><br>
<p>You can see that there's a hole in the zero-sum theory then.  What if 
<br>
all transactions &quot;objectively&quot; have a net-creation of nothing?  What 
<br>
if, for instance, the laws of physics apply to economics too, and no 
<br>
matter what you do, no matter or energy or time or space is created or 
<br>
destroyed in any transaction?
<br>
<p>I would put it this way as in other things.  There is an hierarchy of 
<br>
goods:
<br>
<p>Physical Needs
<br>
Physical Wants
<br>
Pleasures
<br>
Mediate Happiness
<br>
Temporal Fulfillment
<br>
Ethical Fulfillment
<br>
Honor
<br>
Glory
<br>
<p>At the level of the physical are the &quot;objective&quot; transactions of simple 
<br>
Time.
<br>
At the level of Honor and Glory are Good Uses of Time.
<br>
<p>But these will have very little to do with economics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Great, so who ever has bigger guns wins out.
</em><br>
<p>No, whoever is smart enough to stay away from people with big guns wins 
<br>
out.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And why do you call this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'peacefull' anarchy exactly?
</em><br>
<p>Well, let's say you KNOW I have a really, really big gun.  And let's 
<br>
say you think you have a bigger one.  There's still the risk that your 
<br>
bigger gun will not be effective in beating me to the draw and you may 
<br>
die.  It will, therefore, be reasonable for you to seek cooperation 
<br>
rather than competition with me UNLESS your gun is SOOO BIG that I 
<br>
can't possibly win (like our Iraq war), in which case if you are a mean 
<br>
person, you may attack.
<br>
<p>In fact, this is roughly what has happened, the Military Industrial 
<br>
Complex of Capitalism has attacked and you have lost.  Tough cookies.  
<br>
You're a tax-paying slave to whoever they decide to put in the 
<br>
government.
<br>
<p>Alternatively, you can go around killing people and fighting both your 
<br>
current and potential enemies.  We'll call this version of &quot;peaceful 
<br>
anarchy&quot; the peace of Death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And how is this any better than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; current post-industrialize west system?
</em><br>
<p>Its more honest and more local and more manageable.  Clearly I'm 
<br>
suggesting that the current power structures be dismantled.  Why?  
<br>
Because they (the people who collect and manage the 50-70% of your 
<br>
income that goes to the government in a variety of taxes charges and 
<br>
tariffs) managed to gain such an advantage over us non-combatants that 
<br>
we're helpless before them.  It's sad and a little scary.  DO YOU like 
<br>
the fact that GW can drop bombs and call in the CIA to get you, but you 
<br>
can't, and that there are parallels to George Bush calling out hits on 
<br>
the David Kelly's of the world?
<br>
<p>Without the network to support their power structure and without the 
<br>
ideology to support the network, those kinds of things, I believe, 
<br>
would just be a thing of the past.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you not think a local
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warlord pointing a gun at your face to take some of your food you grew
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on your farm is 'alienation of labor'?
</em><br>
<p>Definitely.  I doubt he'd do that if we were on roughly equal 
<br>
&quot;military&quot; footing.  Military footing is gained, once again, by the 
<br>
aggregation of human effort and labor.  This is harder without the 
<br>
underlying structures of power that are already in place (eg money, 
<br>
&quot;free markets&quot;, etc.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   I don't exactly want to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an arsenal, can I pay someone else to do it and ensure no one threatens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me with their aresenal?  Isnt that, in a way, what I am all ready doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with my taxes?
</em><br>
<p>That's your CHOICE.  I don't personally trust the police very much.  I 
<br>
would like to have alternatives.  Isn't that the core of 
<br>
Libertarianism.  We should have competing police.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   After all, if someone comes up to me with a gun, I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those people I pay, and they are hear to drag off the gun toting nut 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep him, basically, from f-ing with me.
</em><br>
<p>If someone comes up to you with a gun with the intent to kill you RIGHT 
<br>
NOW, you're probably dead.  The US police are reactive and exist 
<br>
primarily to protect the property rights of the wealthy.    Call murder 
<br>
in Watts, get no response.  Call Insurance Claim in Beverly Hills, get 
<br>
two patrol cars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's fine, but what if the system you are proposing is worse.  And it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kills millions of people.
</em><br>
<p>Better than billions, right?  Millions would be an improvement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if the system you are rallying most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against is what will bring the world to the closest it can possibly get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to an ideal world free of force?
</em><br>
<p>Doubtful.  Any reason to expect that it is?  Plenty of genocides year 
<br>
after year, century after century demonstrate that STATES - not 
<br>
religions, not hordes, not cave-people, etc. - are the truly dangerous 
<br>
elements in human lives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   How are you determining, objectively,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is the best way to persue such a goal.
</em><br>
<p>Say you've got a burning coal on your hand.  It hurts.  You may 
<br>
conjecture &quot;Well, my hand may hurt more if I take it out&quot; since you 
<br>
just don't know.  So you leave it there.  &quot;Better the devil you know, 
<br>
after all,&quot; you muse to yourself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am sure Pol Pot thought his goals laudable,
</em><br>
<p>Doubtful.  I'm sure Pol Pot was a murderous power-monger.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems like you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are just doing a lot of complaining, without looking at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your suggestions.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have some concrete suggestions that might tend to make the US 
<br>
slightly better, but they're clearly really just middle-steps and 
<br>
compromises that might make the country less terrifyingly dangerous and 
<br>
evil, but that's all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It also sounds like you are more like a social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarchist then a 'peaceful anarchist'
</em><br>
<p>Maybe.  I don't like pigeonholing myself.  I did it because it was 
<br>
convenient for you to categorize me.  If it's more convenient to think 
<br>
of me as a &quot;social anarchist&quot; then fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So we do have property rights then?
</em><br>
<p>Rights are negative.  I don't have a right to take something from you, 
<br>
so you therefore have the right to posses what you posses.  What will 
<br>
really &quot;turn your noodle&quot; is the question &quot;What do I possess?&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Well, what if I want more property
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than you think I should have?
</em><br>
<p>Depends, is it something I need?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Is that when we whip out the big guns and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforce that 'peacefull anarachy'?
</em><br>
<p>Definitely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But regardless, there may be plenty of food and water, but since we all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have property rights, what if I buy up most of the food production land
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and charge what I want for the food.
</em><br>
<p>well, if you were to try to set up a &quot;New STATE&quot; obviously we'd have to 
<br>
deal with you.
<br>
<p>I'll assume that the people who are living without taxes will not want 
<br>
to invite a new warlord to town.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does a gang of 'peacefull
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anarchists' come beating down my fences with machine guns and iron 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bars?
</em><br>
<p>Pretty much.
<br>
<p>| Um, how is this any different then the current market based system?
<br>
<p>Centralization of control and state-sponsored monopolies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; People would have to recognize the value of what they'd achieved to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; make it worth keeping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if they do not recognize the value of what they achieved, what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then?
</em><br>
<p>then they'd be free to change it.  As opposed to NOW when it's nearly 
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p>The point of a free society is that it would have to be free - that is 
<br>
- changeable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Is it not worth keeping.  What if others recognize the value, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producer does not, even though he continues to produce and others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to consume.
</em><br>
<p>Then the producer stops producing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, should we divide up my provisions, perhaps some 50% of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would not starve or freeze, but 50% of my family would.  What is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'right thing to do'?
</em><br>
<p>Well you'll have to figure that out.  You have the same choices today.  
<br>
You can feed yourself or you can help people in cambodia.  What do you 
<br>
do?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Maybe, maybe he is sick of performing brain operations.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; ... he is perfectly content
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sculpt clay instead of perform operations.
</em><br>
<p>Then he's not a doctor, go find someone else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The more something is valued by more people, the higher people are paid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to perform that service, and the more likely people are to perform that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; service.
</em><br>
<p>some people do things because the LIKE to.    Some Doctors genuinely 
<br>
like saving other people's lives.  Those are the people we'd LIKE to 
<br>
have for doctors as opposed to the ones that just LIKE to make money.  
<br>
When money subordinates the health-care profession, you get systems 
<br>
like those in the US where the very wealthy get very good care and the 
<br>
poor and middle class get only emergency care.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He's free, after all.  Of course, I'll die, but he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is free!
</em><br>
<p>why would he want to let you die when he's able to save you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You also say &quot;Each person should be able to determine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value of their own time&quot; Perhaps the good doctor feels his time is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; valued at 1 million dollars per second of operation time.  He is, after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all, free to determine the value of his time, is he not?
</em><br>
<p>and you are free not to pay him, go use some other doctor.  No 
<br>
difference from today's world, the difference is that the Government 
<br>
isn't propping up the cost of medical care in our future dream-world.  
<br>
Doctor's have to eat too, you know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But what if he does not want to help me?  I hear lots of 'shoulds' and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'it's the right thing to do' but no concrete answers to problems.
</em><br>
<p>Because you want to build a system like we have today where people are 
<br>
forced to do things.  Free your mind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure the government is helping, we have no shortage of brain surgeons.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if the supply and demand theory is true, there is a shortage of 
<br>
brain surgeons - that's why they make so much money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The system, kept in place (for the most part) by governments, helps to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; bread, and that worth is determined by the consumer and the producer in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competition, yet both benefit.
</em><br>
<p>Actually the system that is in place PRE-STEALS your bread and prevents 
<br>
other people from doing so IF the target is wealthy.   It also has a 
<br>
nice habit of changing the value of money occasionally as 
<br>
necessary/convenient.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You insit that worth should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined solely by the producer E.g. &quot;Each person should be able to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine the value of their own time&quot; and seem to suggest that value 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined by an interaction of consumer and producer leads both to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'unfree'
</em><br>
<p>No, it's the 3rd party that I'm complaining about.  You seem to be 
<br>
insisting that there be SOME power structure in place that would FORCE 
<br>
a doctor to treat you NO MATTER WHAT.
<br>
<p>Well, tough patooties.  That system doesn't exist now, nor do I think 
<br>
it would be ideal, for the system that would force doctors to fix you 
<br>
might also force them to be slaves.  Is that what you want? Slavery?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; How about asking nicely, most people are reasonable when
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; asked.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the people who are not reasonable?
</em><br>
<p>Well, you're the one asking for help, ask nicely.  If they say no, move 
<br>
on.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I thought you said &quot;Each person should be able to determine the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value of their own time&quot;  What if the value of his time is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unreasonable fee to me?
</em><br>
<p>That's right, they shouldn't be FORCED by some third party to make 
<br>
arbitrary exchanges.  If you can't FORCE me to do something, then I do 
<br>
it because I WANT to.
<br>
<p>In our world, all people are effectively forced to pay taxes and that 
<br>
drives &quot;most&quot; of them to take shitty jobs.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Robbie, how is this *any* different than a market based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism?
</em><br>
<p>I said I was a libertarian.  The difference is the non-existence of a 
<br>
force-based 3rd-party either propping up demand or supply with nuclear 
<br>
weapons and VX gas.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Either he determines the value of his time, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the parties involved determine the value (the producers and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumers)
</em><br>
<p>If he can freely walk away from a transaction, he determines the value 
<br>
of the transaction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And what if I did not?  A significant majority of the population does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not 'plan well enough' for such things, yet society generally expects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them to receive the same 'adequate' health care that others who do plan
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well enough receive.
</em><br>
<p>How is this a problem?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; in turn would pay because if they didn't you'd be pissed and so would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the rest of their customers.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; An insurer would pay because I would be pissed?  What if they had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guns than me?  Would they care if I were pissed?
</em><br>
<p>Only trust people as far as you can throw them, especially insurers.
<br>
<p>Test it for yourself, make a BIG medical claim while under the 
<br>
protection of US law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The system you propose is basically what we have in place in most post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; industrilized west nations, barring the existence of the things most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minarchist liberterians generally object to (drug war, subsidies,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intereference of business by government, etc)  Seems you should just be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a minarchist libertarian, and move to new hampshire with the rest of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a year or two.
</em><br>
<p>Probably.  But the existence of drug wars, subsidies, business 
<br>
interference in governement and vice versa make up the main problems as 
<br>
I see them.  That's what makes the freedom impossible - the underlying 
<br>
material conditions of advanced societies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 'THIS' isnt perfect, but it's the best thing we have seen so far, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fear your sytem would be far far worse.
</em><br>
<p>Fear is the mind killer.  Like I said, the devil you know is worse than 
<br>
the devil you don't.  I don't feel that way.  I feel like I'm stuck in 
<br>
a room with the devil and a bunch of other people, there's a door and 
<br>
it sucks in here and nobody's brave enough to try door B.  I'm ready to 
<br>
try door B, and am tired of the nightly pineapple suppositories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Is that so?  I guess most communist governements just never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; got to sit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; around long enough to turn into full anarachies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It's an empirical question and so I am agnostic about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Huh?  You are agnostic about empirical questions?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, time will tell.  The matter will be settled after a few hundred 
<br>
years.  Your statement was that communisms never get old enough to 
<br>
&quot;come to fruition&quot;.  My statement is - &quot;well, let's wait and see.&quot;  But 
<br>
the evidence so far is that they don't become egalitarian in less than 
<br>
75 years, and there's no reason to expect that they will in the next 75 
<br>
years.  BUT if your proposition is wait 2000 years, I'm willing to wait 
<br>
and be agnostic about this &quot;futurism&quot; question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; By letting people benefit from their own land and labor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In what cases to people not benefit from their labor?
</em><br>
<p>When large percentages of it are paid in taxes that go to support 
<br>
military regimes and programs that serve only to perpetuate themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Which doesn't exist anywhere anymore.
</em><br>
<p>Word games.  I'll substitute &quot;Effective Slavery&quot; if you prefer it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to all sell their land because they don't want to farm, and buy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; land on the water?  There is only so much land on the water, what if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone wants to move there?
</em><br>
<p>What if it started raining monkeys?  Are you Mr. question or what?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But isnt being forced to charge a 'reasonable' fee, as in the case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our Doctor, a form of coercion?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, in order to be a free transaction, he always has to be able to 
<br>
walk away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I am forced to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charge less than what I think my services are worth, I am still
</em><br>
<em>&gt; FORCED!!!
</em><br>
<p>You could just not perform them.  Go pick berries in the forest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the first possible example I give you of where someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values his time differently than what others value you, you assert that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value should be a reasonable interaction of those, this is exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the supply and demand curves determine.
</em><br>
<p>Which supply and demand curves , the &quot;with military-money backing&quot; or 
<br>
the &quot;without military-money backing&quot;.
<br>
<p>Try this one on for size, there is no &quot;supply and demand curve&quot; any 
<br>
more than there are &quot;recessions&quot;.  It's words, mumbo jumbo used to give 
<br>
ease of conceptualization to almost impossibly complex phenomena.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is it just the concept of money you don't like?
</em><br>
<p>Force-backed money.
<br>
<p>If I'm willing to take paper in exchange for tomatoes, that should be 
<br>
my choice.
<br>
<p>In the united states, it's illegal to take alternate forms of money.  
<br>
In fact, in almost every country, they INSIST that you carry on 
<br>
commerce in their form of money - the penalties for setting up 
<br>
alternative money schemes are pretty severe.  That's called FORCED.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Then who will protect me from the people with big guns?  What if I want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to pay for that protection service?
</em><br>
<p>Answered above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Alienation simply means taking something that was yours and making it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; someone else's.  Forced alienation is when someone MAKES you do it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A perfect description of being forced to charge 'reasonable fees'  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are taking somethning that isnt yours (my time, skills, and effort) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making me give it to you for less than I think it is worth.  How do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolve this contradiction?
</em><br>
<p>What am I taking from you?  It seems to me I'm right now GIVING you my 
<br>
time.  Mostly in answering silly questions like this one.  Why?  
<br>
Because I believe you're a rational person also in search of a 
<br>
less-repressive governmental system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; People manage to figure out valuable things that other people want.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you said &quot;Each person should be able to determine the value of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own time&quot;  Maybe I want to be a rock thrower, and I can throw them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really well, and I think it has a lot of value.  I do, after all, get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine the value of my own time.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, go ahead, throw rocks, have at it.  Send pictures home if you 
<br>
want.  What does this have to do with ANYTHING?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; They don't need governments to show them how to do this.  Governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; come in when small groups of people band together and force other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people into submission by violence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, like being forced to charge a 'reasonable' fee?
</em><br>
<p>When people show up and DECIDE FOR YOU what a reasonable fee is, then 
<br>
it's forced.  Otherwise not, it's pretty simple.
<br>
<p>Not clear.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; NOT CLEAR!!!! Have you not seen the pictures of piles of skulls?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tual Song prison camp, where 20,000 political prisoners went in and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SEVEN came out?  The official decrees to 'smash' dissenters and enemies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the people?
</em><br>
<p>At least try to finish the paragraph, jeez.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; It may be that the underlying factors which support
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Australia also support Pol Pot.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it isnt, since Australia's economy is not run by the will of one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual who has absolute power.
</em><br>
<p>Oy vey, if Australia's government supports either directly or 
<br>
indirectly the government of Pol Pot OR the conditions which make the 
<br>
Australian government POSSIBLE also make Pol Pot's goverment more 
<br>
likely, then the Austrialian government is just as bad as Pol Pots.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.CHAP6.HTM">http://www.hawaii.edu/powerkills/WF.CHAP6.HTM</a>
</em><br>
<p>Very familiar.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I understand that the CIA was funding
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Pol Pot's campaign against his people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You understand incorrectly.  But I wont dwell on this point, as it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deviates from the topic.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;What I learned about US Foreign Policy&quot; is one popular video source.
<br>
<p>We have a disagreement about facts here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and people over eat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because food is so damn cheap and consumer goods so inexpensive, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us to live more sedantary lives than ever before.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe.  Maybe they overeat because they're so stressed out and 
<br>
over-commercialized and have absolutely nothing better to do because 
<br>
they're trapped working in shitty jobs paying of large mortgages.  
<br>
Perhaps our societies actually have a psychological effect on the 
<br>
people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Plenty of people work
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with No stress also, work does not absolutely cause stress.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, and plenty of people work with stress.  I'll get stats, but I'm 
<br>
pretty sure they favor the stress explanation.  BUT as a rhetorical 
<br>
move, as far as I know nothing :ABSOLUTELY: causes anything at all.  
<br>
Isn't that one of the basics of physics nowadays?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But suffuce to say, in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example your hunch is entirely wrong.
</em><br>
<p>Interesting hypothesis.
<br>
<p>I've been wrong before.  Let's hear your evidence.
<br>
<p>Which people?
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
All the people, as an average, both the mean and the median.  Did they
<br>
<em>&gt; live better lives or not?
</em><br>
<p>No idea.  You?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Can you think of any way to measure the quality of life besides
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'limosuines per capita'?
</em><br>
<p>Number of minutes during the day spent doing anything I like.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
