</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dan, X-rays are an ionizing radiation and

</em><br>
<p>I did not argue that they were not harmful.  My point was that a dental
<br>
X-ray has benefits too, such as in diagnosing tooth decay and even gum
<br>
disease.  One has to evaluate getting them with respect to both the
<br>
risks and the benefits.  The same is true of many other known harmful
<br>
things, such as other X-rays and other medical procedures.  In some
<br>
cases, they might not be worth the risk -- as in full body scans in
<br>
people who have no symptoms for any diseases.  The exposure to
<br>
X-radiation in those seems out of proportion to the benefits.
<br>
(Hopefully, as scanning technology becomes better, this can be
<br>
mitigated.  I'm only talking about the state of the art now in the
<br>
popular full body scans.)
<br>
<p>Also, regarding my friend, he did not make his choice based on a review
<br>
of the data.  It's sort of like he's decided not to ever fly in planes
<br>
because planes can crash.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
