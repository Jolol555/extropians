<p>Now the Saudis think Barbie dolls are a threat to their
<br>
culture.  This got me to thinking: is it only in the
<br>
west, or is it everywhere including islamic nations,
<br>
where young people and especially teens are disrespectful
<br>
and mouthy?  Certainly the Saudi teenagers would see 
<br>
TV and ask &quot;Why is it that the decadent and immoral
<br>
west has so many cool things whereas we totally suck?&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The doll was described as a Jewish doll, promoting anti-Islamic ideals. I 
<br>
wonder why Americans and Europeans do not see the greater need to separate us, 
<br>
energy-wise, from this political religious fascism? Americans should be earning 
<br>
jobs in developing our own fuels and electricity. We needn't import Saudi 
<br>
petroleum. I am less concerned about the Wahabbis's, whom I deem to be vicious and 
<br>
crazed; then I am about those who purchase their oil. What is wrong with us?
