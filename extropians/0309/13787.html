<p>Ok, that is good -- but don't go for self-fullfilling perspectives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm also only 5'3&quot; so I am a good candidate for a Mars mission :-)
</em><br>
<p>There you go spike -- a volunteer from the audience!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Until recently I had been of the opinion that cancer cause smoking, not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other way around.
</em><br>
<p>No -- it is very clear and well documented -- certain enzymes, primarily
<br>
found in the liver transform molecules found in smoke into cancer causing
<br>
(carcinogenic) molecules -- but whether one has those genetic (enzyme)
<br>
variants cannot be determined (easily) currently.  This explains why some
<br>
people smoke and get cancer and other people smoke and don't get cancer.
<br>
<p>This is clear: Some people are susceptable to addiction (largely genetics).
<br>
Some of those people smoke.  A subset of those people get cancer and
<br>
have a diminished lifespan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (Have you ever met an alcoholic non-smoker?)
</em><br>
<p>I know of individuals, who once did smoke, who would probably fall into
<br>
this category -- i.e. they don't smoke but can be considered alcoholics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I know it was the nicotine talking.
</em><br>
<p>And as I pointed out -- I don't think it is the nicotine that is particularly
<br>
bad -- it is all the other stuff that is in the smoke.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I used to eat 3 peanut butter sandwiches per day. Yet my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; body weight has never been below or above average.
</em><br>
<p>Peanut butter sandwiches are probably not particularly bad.  You probably
<br>
have a fast metabolism that explains being able to maintain the weight level.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My great-grandmother died at 96 a few years ago.
</em><br>
<p>Suggests that (at least from one source) that one may not have the genes
<br>
that lead one from smoking to cancer -- but that probably only involves
<br>
about 12% of your risk factors (one has to take all of the other relatives
<br>
into account).
