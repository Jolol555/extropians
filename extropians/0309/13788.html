<p>Actually this is a poor assumption.  People are &quot;rational and wise&quot; within
<br>
their survival framework -- there is nothing to guarantee that that framework
<br>
is &quot;rational and wise&quot;.  I'll cite the example of Mohammed Ali -- it was
<br>
&quot;rational and wise&quot; for him to engage in boxing from the prespective that
<br>
he would win the matches be awarded prizes, fame and fortune.  However, it
<br>
was *not* &quot;rational and wise&quot; from the framework that boxing tends to
<br>
cause brain damage and may lead to significant negative consequences
<br>
(e.g. Parkinson's like symptoms) later in life.  And I don't know if
<br>
he had sufficient information to make an &quot;informed&quot; decision until
<br>
he became the classic example for why boxing is self-destructive.
<br>
<p>So very often people may go after the short term benefits and ignore
<br>
the long term consequences (e.g. &quot;live for today for tomorrow you may
<br>
be dead).
<br>
<p>So one requires a better definition of &quot;rational and wise&quot; that takes
<br>
into account the discounted value of present life vs. future life.
<br>
Hell, if an asteroid is going to strike the Earth next week and wipe
<br>
out a large part of humanity, why shouldn't I break into a store and
<br>
steal a plasma HDTV?  I at least get to enjoy it for a week.  No
<br>
significant consequences -- no reason to be &quot;rational and wise&quot;.
<br>
So it comes down to an ability to predict consequences (which I
<br>
believe is a very ill-defined art.)
