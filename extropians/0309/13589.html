<p>Life's Lethal Quality Control?
<br>
<p>Cancer is such a deadly scourge of life that one wonders why it was not
<br>
strongly selected against and totally eliminated from all forms of life
<br>
long ago.  Does cancer's eons-long persistence among a wide spectrum of
<br>
living things imply that it has some purpose---some positive value that
<br>
we are blind to?
<br>
<p>In SF#30, back in 1983, it was observed that the incidence of cancer is
<br>
strongly correlated with the complexity of organisms.  It would seem
<br>
therefore that cancer tends to damp out any tendency life has (or is
<br>
given) to attain higher states of diversity and complexity.  Some even
<br>
hold that cancer is the price that must be paid by higher forms of life!
<br>
<p>But there is much more to be said about the potential roles of cancer in
<br>
the development of human life.
<br>
<p>It must be recognized that the bulk of human cancers occur in individuals
<br>
beyond the age of reproduction.  If old-age cancer has an evolutionary
<br>
purpose, it might be simply the reduction of the drain nonproducing oldsters
<br>
place upon society.
<br>
<p>One can also speculate as do A. Leroi and J. Graham that cancer is one of
<br>
evolution' methods of quality control.  To be effective in this role,
<br>
cancer must affect individuals capable of reproduction---before they
<br>
reproduce.  However, there are only a few lethal childhood cancers
<br>
specifically associated with additions to human biological diversity.  Two
<br>
such examples are: brain cancer and bone cancer.
<br>
<p>These are interesting observations, but they alone can hardly account for
<br>
the strong correlation between cancer incidence and complexity.
<br>
<p>J. Graham goes much further in his 1992 book _Cancer Selection_.  There, he
<br>
claims that cancer is *the* driving force in the creation of biological
<br>
diversity.  In other words, living things tend to evolve features that
<br>
reduce the incidence of cancer.  One of the examples Graham proposes is
<br>
the evolution of shells by snails to protect themselves from cancer-inducing
<br>
solar ultraviolet light.  His book contains many more examples.
<br>
<p>(Watts, Geoff; &quot;Life's Lethal Quality Control,&quot; *The Times Higher Education
<br>
Supplement*, April 11, 2003.  Cr. J. Graham.)
<br>
<p>Comment.  Since cancer has survived the filtering action of natural
<br>
selection for hundreds of millions of years and attacks so many organs
<br>
in so many diverse species, we wonder if it has a single, simplistic
<br>
explanation.
