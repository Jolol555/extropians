Thanks to Robert and to Reason for their submissions.
<br>
As Robert's cautionary note cautions, this is a
<br>
volatile subject, so all and sundry should be
<br>
respectful and wary and practice safe sects.  Reason
<br>
as ever is the soul of, er, reason, ...and moderate
<br>
discourse.  Love youse guys.
<br>
<p>Two comments if I may.  
<br>
<p>From Krugman's piece we have the following:
<br>
<p>&quot;The starting point of supply-side economics is an
<br>
assertion that no economist would dispute: taxes
<br>
reduce the incentive to work, save and invest.&quot; 
<br>
<p>to which I direct your particular attention.  In
<br>
support of the above, the paragraph finishes with:
<br>
<p>&quot;A businessman who knows that 70 cents of every extra
<br>
dollar he makes will go to the I.R.S. is less willing
<br>
to make the effort to earn that extra dollar than if
<br>
he knows that the I.R.S. will take only 35 cents. So
<br>
reducing tax rates will, other things being the same,
<br>
spur the economy.&quot;
<br>
<p>If this is something &quot;that no economist would
<br>
dispute&quot;, (I would suppose because the data in support
<br>
of this assertion is rock solid, unrelenting, and
<br>
without flaw, though I've not seen this data
<br>
personally) nevertheless, allow me, for the sake of
<br>
balance, to take the opposing view.
<br>
<p>If you tax an (over)achiever, and thus reduce his
<br>
income--take him down a notch from that to which he
<br>
has become accustomed--shall he not then, in
<br>
conformity with his nature, resolve to redouble his
<br>
efforts, work harder, recover that which he has lost,
<br>
and strive as before for ever greater glory, and still
<br>
ever greater glory after that?  Camels and capitalists
<br>
aren't quitters.  Rather they persevere right up to
<br>
the moment when their back snaps. No?
<br>
<p>Thus, it follows that more taxes on the rich, and more
<br>
taxes after that, and after that, motivates
<br>
achievement and drives the engine of productivity.
<br>
(and if there are no economists to support this view,
<br>
perhaps that reflects a uniformity of obeisance to the
<br>
swinishly over-rich, would that I were one.)
<br>
<p>In support of this theory of high taxes to optimize
<br>
productivity, I give you two examples: Alabama, with
<br>
low taxes and low everything else (as cited in the
<br>
Krugman piece) and California--or as Spike is wont to
<br>
call it, &quot;Taxifornia&quot;--which is a virtual utopia of 
<br>
prosperity arising from hyper-achievement, despite (or
<br>
perhaps in consequence of) a near-crushing tax burden
<br>
(and traffic hell/road rage/fremen training regimen to
<br>
make international terrorism seem a case of hiccups by
<br>
comparison).
<br>
<p>PS: I'm not arguing in favor of taxation or other
<br>
Arrakis-style hardening, but rather for a balanced
<br>
view on the theoretical front.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;Believe nothing, no matter where you read it, or who
<br>
said it--no matter if I have said it--unless it agrees
<br>
with your own reason and your common sense.&quot;

<em>&gt; &gt; I know it is probably unwise for me to post this. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be useful for people in the U.S. as well as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign observers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of U.S. politics to understand one aspect of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; U.S. political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; arena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why is this important?  Because the politics are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driving decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that may seriously impact the funds available in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the future for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everything from the National Nanotechnology

<em>&gt; Initiative to DARPA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; funding of AI research to biotech and health
</em><br>

<em>&gt; &gt; The Tax-Cut Con
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; By PAUL KRUGMAN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/magazine/14TAXES.html?pagewanted=print">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/magazine/14TAXES.html?pagewanted=print</a>
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is long, but perhaps one can sit down, read it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and think about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some points it makes and some potential
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Mind you, I am not as opposed to deficit funding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I once was --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but I want to see clear evidence that the funds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will primarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be being used to accelerate technology development
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that will bail
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; us out.  I'm not sure that I see that at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Interestingly, if one looks at the U.S. &quot;war on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism&quot; as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as the Columbia disaster -- both appear to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costing out at a rate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slightly in excess of $50 million per human life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost.  It would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interesting to compare that with &quot;standard&quot; values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that courts use for wrongful death suits which I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would guess are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; typically an order of magnitude less.
</em><br>
