<p><em>&gt; While I was there, I looked at a few other manuscripts in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; collection. Many were very extensive indeed-and completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unpublished. Looking at one which was full of quotations of Greek
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poetry, I said to one of the local scholars that he ought to publish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. He said he was too busy with other papyri, and I had to confess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I was also. But this made me aware of how much remains to be

<p>Gee. Its pretty amazing, to me anyway, that *any* manuscripts of
<br>
Aristotle or Plato in existence anywhere would not by now have
<br>
been deemed worthy of someone's translation efforts.
<br>
<p>Almost scary in a way. I think we (humans) often assume that
<br>
things that would be of interest to ourselves (and presumably
<br>
at least a bunch of others) will get translated by someone if we
<br>
don't do it. {I don't qualify in this case though, as alas, everything
<br>
except English is &quot;all Greek to me&quot;}. I await developments
<br>
in language translation software with some enthusiasm and hope
<br>
to order my Babel fish early.
<br>
<p>Scary that so much, so worth doing, can be left undone after so
<br>
many generations. Makes boredom almost look like a sin.
<br>
<p>Carpe diem, I guess.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
