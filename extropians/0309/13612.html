If the majority of cancers occur in individuals after the age of
<br>
reproduction, there would be no filter to remove them.
<br>
<p>In fact, any genetic mutation that caused any type of problem after the
<br>
reproductive years should persist through the years. This would leave most
<br>
people today with a variety of mutations that continue to be passed on to
<br>
their offspring. They would continue to persist over hundreds of millions of
<br>
years with no selection pressure applied whatsoever.
<br>
<p>I wouldn;t think that this would be quality control, or serve any purpose.
<br>
It's simply a bunch of bad mutations that have spread throughout the
<br>
population simply because they don't affect the ability to reproduce.
<br>
<p>This would also be why younger people have far fewer incidences of cancer.
<br>
Those cancers would be filtered more by selection pressures.
<br>
<p>I know there are ways that scientists have been able to date mutations such
<br>
as in the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA. I wonder if these mutations
<br>
could be dated as well. If so, upon examination we should find that the
<br>
childhood cancers are much younger mutations than the cancers that affect
<br>
the elderly.Natural selection may have already been reducing these, but not
<br>
eliminating since some of the children are still going to survive to the
<br>
point where they could reproduce. Any increases today in childhood cancers
<br>
would only be because of our medical ability to help these children with
<br>
these mutatins survive and reproduce, thereby spreading the mutation further
<br>
than it would have &quot;naturally&quot;

<em>&gt; &gt; Life's Lethal Quality Control?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Cancer is such a deadly scourge of life that one wonders why it was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strongly selected against and totally eliminated from all forms of life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; long ago.  Does cancer's eons-long persistence among a wide spectrum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; living things imply that it has some purpose---some positive value that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we are blind to?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In SF#30, back in 1983, it was observed that the incidence of cancer is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strongly correlated with the complexity of organisms.  It would seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; therefore that cancer tends to damp out any tendency life has (or is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; given) to attain higher states of diversity and complexity.  Some even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hold that cancer is the price that must be paid by higher forms of life!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But there is much more to be said about the potential roles of cancer in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the development of human life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It must be recognized that the bulk of human cancers occur in
</em><br>
individuals
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; beyond the age of reproduction.  If old-age cancer has an evolutionary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; purpose, it might be simply the reduction of the drain nonproducing
</em><br>
oldsters
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; place upon society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; One can also speculate as do A. Leroi and J. Graham that cancer is one
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evolution' methods of quality control.  To be effective in this role,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cancer must affect individuals capable of reproduction---before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reproduce.  However, there are only a few lethal childhood cancers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specifically associated with additions to human biological diversity.
</em><br>
Two
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such examples are: brain cancer and bone cancer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; These are interesting observations, but they alone can hardly account
</em><br>
for
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the strong correlation between cancer incidence and complexity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; J. Graham goes much further in his 1992 book _Cancer Selection_.  There,
</em><br>
he
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; claims that cancer is *the* driving force in the creation of biological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; diversity.  In other words, living things tend to evolve features that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reduce the incidence of cancer.  One of the examples Graham proposes is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the evolution of shells by snails to protect themselves from
</em><br>
cancer-inducing
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; solar ultraviolet light.  His book contains many more examples.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Comment.  Since cancer has survived the filtering action of natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; selection for hundreds of millions of years and attacks so many organs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in so many diverse species, we wonder if it has a single, simplistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; explanation.
