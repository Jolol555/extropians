</em><br>
<p>Oh, no question.  It is likely they comprise almost
<br>
all of the &quot;small minority&quot; of relatively smart
<br>
crooks.  But even they tend to run legitimate
<br>
businesses as well.  Whatever brings in the money.
<br>
<p>One kind of scam they run, we're all probably familiar
<br>
with.  You know all those spams for ultra-cheap
<br>
medications?  True, a number of them come from
<br>
legitimate generics, but a number of them are also
<br>
stolen medications.  They don't care (don't really
<br>
know) if the meds have expired, been ruined due to
<br>
poor storage conditions, or what.  This is one of the
<br>
ways some of the more corrupt governments get money
<br>
out of the medicine in humanitarian aid packages meant
<br>
for their people.  (They do this with the food, too.
<br>
Anything that can be repackaged and sold to the
<br>
outside world.)
<br>
<p>And, of course, don't forget that the same tongue that
<br>
can swindle a few bucks today would be right at home
<br>
in the mouth of tomorrow's politician.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think there are probably strong psychological
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons for there to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligent, uncaught criminals; I'd bet there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of extreme talents
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they tend to either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be eventually caught, or drop out after a little
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while?
</em><br>
<p>My own experiences with such in the cracker (black hat
<br>
hacker) community is that, if they do not wind up
<br>
getting rich off their efforts within a few years,
<br>
they tend to switch over to the legal side as
<br>
&quot;security consultants&quot;.  I would not be surprised if
<br>
this happens in other cases too, generating a number
<br>
of police and military recruits.  It's been cited that
<br>
one of the leading indicators for crime has been youth
<br>
unemployment: a bunch of kids (teens, sometimes on up
<br>
to mid 20s depending on how one counts the statistics)
<br>
not seeing anything better to do with their time.
