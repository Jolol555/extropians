It's a good thing because it's the only was that large constructions can

be accomplished without an authoritarian government.  I believe that the 
<br>
first one was the Lord Mayor and Corporation of London, and it was used 
<br>
to essentiall build London.
<br>
<p>But these small investors can't know what it being done in their name. 
<br>
The have ownership, but not control.  Those who have control are the 
<br>
ones who should bear moral/legal responsibility.  But a limited fiscal 
<br>
responsibility is reasonable.
<br>
<p>Another way of saying it is the minor stockholders don't really own the 
<br>
corporations.  They are merely lending their fiscal resources.  If you 
<br>
don't control something, you don't own it.  If you do control it, 
<br>
pertending that you aren't responsible because you don't own it should 
<br>
be no defense.
