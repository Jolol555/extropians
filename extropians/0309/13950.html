<p><em>&gt; You cannot use that argument.

<p>If I can not use my argument, you can't use yours.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Cancer is a greater killer now
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply because things like vaccines, antibiotics and better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nutrition allow people to live longer and therefore they have
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Why is it such a controversial proposition that the noxious fumes, 
<br>
radioactive waste, heavy metals and other KNOWN CARCINOGENS that we 
<br>
spew forth into the atmosphere, water and earth at a rate of 
<br>
100,000,000 tonnes/year are killing us because they are carcinogenic?
<br>
<p><p>I've granted your point (in fact, I'm sure I made it myself) - getting 
<br>
older TAUTOLOGICALLY gives more exposure to cancer causing agents.
<br>
<p>SO WHAT?
<br>
<p>Isn't the point that we will all continue to get older NO MATTER WHAT 
<br>
so the obvious course of action is to reduce the exposure to the 
<br>
cancer-causing agents.  To do that will require a significant reworking 
<br>
of our political economy.
<br>
<p>Is there something really THAT controversial about my claims here?
