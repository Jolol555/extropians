<p>We're talking at cross purposes a bit here. The kind of limited liability
<br>
contracts I was talking about were made by merchants engaged in regular,
<br>
peaceful trade. The liability that was limited was the financial liability
<br>
incurred to suppliers, subcontractors etc ie one that arose in the course of
<br>
trading. This is what LL covers in the modern legal system as well. What you
<br>
are talking about (forgive me if I'm wrong) is the legal and moral liability
<br>
of officers and investors for the harm done to third parties as a
<br>
consequence of the corporation's activities (whether as externalities or
<br>
directly). That's a different issue, on the whole I agree with you rather
<br>
than Charles. The problem here is not LL per se but the way modern
<br>
corporations work and interact with the political process. Undoubtedly there
<br>
is a general ducking of responsibility going on. As a historical footnote
<br>
the kind of imperialist 'trade' you refer to (as carried on by the East
<br>
India Company, VVD et al) was carried out by chartered corporations given LL
<br>
by political fiat. Steve Davies
