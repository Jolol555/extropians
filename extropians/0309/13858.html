<em>&gt;-----Original Message-----

<em>&gt;From: Robbie Lindauer

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If you want one, you've got to take it.  I could give it to you, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then I'd have less.  You'd have to trade something, but there's only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the two things.
</em><br>
<p>And
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Positive-sum games do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; exist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ah, like Amway.
</em><br>
<p>Do all transactions require someone to lose and another to win?  Are all
<br>
exchanges zero sum or are they not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The earth has a limited amount of fundamental resources - Land, Food, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Energy, human effort, etc.  We can re-arrange the distribution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;items a lot (that's what the global economy IS...) but it doesn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;usually create NET more land, food or human effort.
</em><br>
<p>Does the Earth have a limited amount of Wealth?  Last I checked, we
<br>
werent running out of Food or Energy, since we have more of both now
<br>
than ever in the entire history of humanity.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And yes, there are alternative value economic theories, Marx is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;standard, I like the modifications by Istvan Meszaros.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ah, and so many extropian list members thought there were no communists
<br>
on board.  Jeff Davis, you have a buddy, someone who shares your idea
<br>
that a moral communist state can exist.  Sure, it may, but no communist
<br>
state has ever come close to being moral, and Robbie, I am surprised to
<br>
hear you make such comments, since there is NO FORM OF GOVERNMENT that
<br>
is farther from extropian as communist ones have been.  But alas, I am
<br>
sure you are holding out for that perfect extropian communist government
<br>
eh? Maybe one of those ingorant peasant farmers will bring about the
<br>
singularity.  As Gorby pointed out in the late 80's, Singapore generated
<br>
more wealth than the ENTIRE Soviet Union.  But it must have been because
<br>
it was exploiting the working man, right?
