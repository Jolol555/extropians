<em>&gt; Someday, if I ever have the time and energy, I'm going to see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if I can present a talk to the Mars Society starting out with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how nanotech can make significant contributions to colonization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ending up with how, instead, it *should* be used to dismantle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the planet.  Mind you, I may not return to the ExI list after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a presentation.  But boy, would I have fun bursting *that*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; balloon.
</em><br>

<p>I once joined the Mars society, and never renewed my membership. This is
<br>
probably one of the most closed minded groups of intelligent people you will
<br>
ever meet. These people care about one thing...going to Mars as soon as
<br>
possible. They aren't concerned with any major achievements and I don't
<br>
doubt that they would lead us into another Moon scenario where we go, and
<br>
never return.
<br>
They do not &quot;get&quot; nanotech, nor do they &quot;get&quot; the human culture or
<br>
capitalism. They don't understand how their efforts affect the future of
<br>
humanity and look after their own pet project rather than the greater good
<br>
of the human race.
<br>
Personally, I would like to see us forget about Mars for a while and focus
<br>
on settlement of the moon as a launch platform to the rest of the solar
<br>
system. What could nano do to turn moon dust into usable energy? I would
<br>
also like to see us man a mission to a NEO and attempt to change it's
<br>
course. This way we can begin to understand how to defend ourselves against
<br>
these planet killers. It would really be a bad thing to be on the verge of
<br>
immortality when a big rock smacks us hard enough to either kill us, or set
<br>
us back about 2000 years.
<br>
<p>So anyways, good luck with your speech. I hope you can return in one piece!
