<em>&gt; &gt; Personally, I don't see myself doing so *voluntarily*

<em>&gt; &gt; especially when any benevolence, real or alleged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would be a matter still to be determined at least so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; far as I was concerned.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or am I missing the point here? How *would* a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; super general AI actually benefit? Would it have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *no* political power but say instantly suggest optimal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; game theoretical solutions to otherwise intractable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problems or is it the super inventor that cares nothing for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intellectual  property rights?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At first, of course, the AI would have to work through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human agents at some level, if for nothing else than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to hook it up to things that can affect the real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world.  
</em><br>
<p>It seems so. It the emergent intelligence scenario the AI either
<br>
accumulates resources say net resources without paying for
<br>
them in order to grow, a practice that we'd normally regard
<br>
as hostile and theft were humans to do it. 
<br>
<p>In the seed AI scenario, someone will initially made the buys
<br>
or sells on the AI's behalf as it won't be a legal person and
<br>
presumably won't be able to trade. This means the AI is
<br>
likely to be treated as owned by the proxy and the proxy's
<br>
friendliness rather than the AI's would seem to be the point. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The AI's &quot;magic&quot; is not in generating some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; real world influence from nothing, but in leveraging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even a tiny bit of real world influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consider, for instance, an AI that could correctly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess the next hour's trading on Wall Street with 99+%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accuracy, with an online daytrading account starting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at $1,000 as some researcher's experiment.  With the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting string of &quot;good days&quot;, this money would grow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exponentially, eventually allowing the AI to become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the majority stockholder in several corporations.
</em><br>
<p>The first AI would have to buy the stocks through proxy.
<br>
That proxy has quite a lot of power. One persons 
<br>
ideological utopia is often another peoples nightmare
<br>
scenario. The wealth and power go back not to the AI
<br>
(and non person under law) but to its human proxy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Granted, the stocks would all be in its host
</em><br>
<em>&gt; researcher's name, but the AI would also presumably be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; familiar enough with said researcher to gain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperation - voluntary or not, knowing or not - in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; setting the AI itself up as the mouthpiece through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which orders are given. 
</em><br>
<p>But how would the rest of the world react. AI's human
<br>
proxy Joe is getting super rich wiping out his competitors
<br>
and outcompeting everyone with a rate of change that they
<br>
can't match. This looks to the losers like an arms race or 
<br>
marketing war against Joe who is using the AI as a tool.
<br>
<p>Politically it is very hard to see people standing for it
<br>
and not attacking Joe or trying to counter Joe and his
<br>
pervieved &quot;tool&quot; AI.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A bit more capital would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; allow it to become the sole stockholder in at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of these cases, streamlining the process.
</em><br>
<p>Not it Joe, it proxy. It can't own shares its not a person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Purchase orders could then be used to acquire real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods (likely among them: distributed hosts for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or consider the super inventor you described above,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who works with its creators to develop product ideas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and optimal markets, forming the basis of a &quot;miracle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works&quot; corporation that acquires wealth in the normal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fashion but greatly accelerated.  And then the AI,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having taken over financial management as well (&quot;I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a calculator, and I have downloaded all the applicable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws; what savings or benefits would we accrue by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hiring an accountant?&quot;), has a few ideas for how to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spend a portion of the wealth it has helped generate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course, the problem of rebellion against the law,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but we're presupposing an AI more than capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning from history - including the classic problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of dictators mismanaging things and trying to patch
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over things with fear or propaganda rather than fixing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the true problem - and of fixing things so there's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very little if anything that people have any desire to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rebel against (and of maintaining enough humility to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sure this really is the case, rather than just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deluding itself or having its agents delude it).
</em><br>
<p>Yeah but what about the people that see the AI using
<br>
Joe as his buyer (and Joe is really getting rich and
<br>
powerful btw and Joe is not designed to be friendly
<br>
in all folks terms). My point is Joe and his AI are
<br>
likely to face a strong political backlash. 
<br>
<p>Aren't they?
