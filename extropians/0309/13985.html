<p>I don't see how it's even controversial.  We know that extended

exposure to carcinogens increases the risk of cancer.  We know that 
<br>
we're dumping carcinogens into the environment at an alarming rate.  We 
<br>
know that we're living longer.
<br>
<p>The two combine to form the positive statement:
<br>
<p>&quot;If we want to live longer and not get cancer, we should reduce the 
<br>
number of carcinogens in our environment.&quot;
<br>
<p>I admit that there is the possibility of reshaping the human genome to 
<br>
be less susceptible to cancer-causing agents, but doubt that that will 
<br>
be accomplished in a way that's going to help ME and YOU and/or &quot;most 
<br>
people&quot;.  Remember, &quot;most people&quot; can't afford health insurance.

<p>As far as I know there simply is no fact of the matter as to &quot;what will

happen next.&quot;  To understand this consider the possibility that the

<br>
<p>The epistemological problem of predicting the behavior of very 
<br>
large-scale biological systems is notoriously difficult.  Consider my 
<br>
Grandmother who smoked for the middle 70 years of her now 
<br>
84-and-kicking years. We may get better at it, but the point remains, 
<br>
we simply don't know what's going to happen.  The most probable 
<br>
explanation for that fact is that there just is no matter of fact about 
<br>
what is GOING to happen (at least that seems obvious to me, I know 
<br>
there are alternative points of view).
<br>
<p>JR Lucas has a great book on the modalities of future-tense statements 
<br>
&quot;The Future&quot; it presumes to solve all of the determinist &quot;word games&quot; 
<br>
with the simple observation that the past is fixed, the future merely

possible.

</em><br>
<p>Well, there are a few options: we could rework the political economy so 
<br>
that we don't dump billions upon billions of gallons of carcinogens 
<br>
into our environment every year OR we could rework the human genome so 
<br>
that it's less susceptible to carcinogens.
<br>
<p>You can take your pick about which is MORE LIKELY to reduce the cancer 
<br>
rate.    Personally, I think that while medical solutions may be 
<br>
forthcoming, they certainly aren't HERE and that even when they are, 
<br>
their likelihood of solving the problem GLOBALLY is pretty slim.  
<br>
That's just an opinion based on the years and years of semi-successful 
<br>
treatment of cancer.  Obviously, from above, I just don't think there's 
<br>
any fact of the matter.  Instead, there is our own subjective 
<br>
assessment of &quot;What makes sense.&quot;  If we wanted to be smart, we'd move 
<br>
simultaneously down both tracks, right?
<br>
<p>It &quot;just makes sense&quot; to me that we should stop dumping alarming 
<br>
amounts of known toxins of all kinds into our food-chain and 
<br>
environment generally.  THAT will require a reworking of our political 
<br>
economy.  This has the benefit of being at least within our power.  
<br>
This doesn't make sense to you?  What are your proposing?

<p><p>Well, so far I've been called a lot of bad things, now we can add

&quot;combative and one-tracked&quot; to liberal, etc.  How does your remark

answer the question at hand:
<br>
<p>Should we or should we not stop dumping toxins and known carcinogens 
<br>
into our environment?  Wouldn't that go a long way toward reducing our 
<br>
exposure to said carcinogens?  Isn't that LIKELY to reduce our risk of 
<br>
cancers?
<br>
<p>As for me being one-tracked, this particular thread was the smallest, 
<br>
tiniest, most insignificant point I made in a response to what I 
<br>
thought was actually an interesting and important question.
<br>
<p>If I wasn't so immune to social pressure, I'd think you guys were 
<br>
picking on me because I'm not an MD.  But even a non-MD knows that 
<br>
reducing exposure to carcinogens is a good idea, but that it's only 
<br>
&quot;LIKELY&quot; to prevent cancer.

<p>Agreed.  &quot;Some amount of toxins&quot; are a good idea.  But then Robert also 
<br>
seems to be claiming that eating a nice apple would probably do the 
<br>
trick in that regard.  I don't think he's suggesting that we should all 
<br>
be ingesting large amounts of aluminum, cesium and asbestos.  Are you?
<br>
<p>My point is simply that to reduce the overall amount of carcinogens and 
<br>
known toxins in our environment is a GOOD IDEA if we want to extend our 
<br>
lives and our chances for survival.  I still don't see why this is even 
<br>
slightly controversial.
