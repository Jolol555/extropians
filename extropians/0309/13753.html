-----Original Message-----

<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And then to make it really interesting -- you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might take a stab at using nuclear power...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nuclear power isn't applicable to first or second
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stages, where you need very large thrust.
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Nuclear power could achieve higher thrust...
<br>
<p><p>Certainly much higher *specific* thrust.  As for
<br>
peak thrust, the good old kerosine-lox engine is
<br>
hard to beat.  I know of nothing nuclear on the 
<br>
drawing board currently that would challenge it for
<br>
vertical launch.  There are some interesting
<br>
ideas for air breathing nuclear engines, but
<br>
it suffers from the comment you made about getting
<br>
around the no-nukes crowd.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Don't compare NERVA data which was only a test bed to F-1s, SSMEs, or
</em><br>
other
<br>
<em>&gt; engines that made it out of the lab.  Nuclear powered rockets can
</em><br>
achieve higher
<br>
<em>&gt; temperatures and exhaust velocities.  The chief drawback is they're
</em><br>
tough sells
<br>
<em>&gt; politically...
</em><br>
<p><p>Yes, of course the higher exhaust velocity is
<br>
again specific thrust.  Actually my comment about
<br>
first and second stages was referring to the 
<br>
exhaust products of those two stages ending up
<br>
in the atmosphere.  I suppose that
<br>
a few nations might object to radioactive rocket
<br>
exhaust raining down from above.  Imagine that,
<br>
the radical greenies.  {8^D
<br>
<p>These kinds of problems are so persistent and
<br>
apparently insoluble that I have concentrated my 
<br>
thinking not on making boosters bigger but in making 
<br>
payloads smaller, in which case our present stable of
<br>
launchers will suffice.  
<br>
<p>Zubrin's relatively simple STS-derived booster 
<br>
looks like a hell of a good idea: use the 
<br>
existing SSMEs, solids and external tank with 
<br>
a sort of shuttle-minus-the-wings-and-wheels 
<br>
concept.  We already have the infrastructure
<br>
to make a lotta that stuff, plus the launch
<br>
facility.  We could hoist a lot of stuff with
<br>
something like that, as well as placing the
<br>
external tank in a high enough orbit to park
<br>
it for a while, then use it for something up
<br>
there.
