<em>&gt; &gt; Whose talking about a &quot;disembodied brain&quot;?  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you mean by &quot;disembodied&quot;? An SI is embodied with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; computational matrix and may have many extensions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the physical world in the way of devices it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controls.
</em><br>
<p>In addition to what Brett said: when first created,
<br>
why would a SI necessarily have any extensions in the
<br>
physical world?  (Though, if it did have some -
<br>
enough that it could build more, possibly after
<br>
acquiring, by theft if necessary, the tools to do so -
<br>
then see the &quot;unconstrained replicator&quot; problem.  Not
<br>
quite gray goo since it's macroscale, but many similar
<br>
features.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I for one would have serious difficulties taking on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value that such an entity should be submitted to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; merely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it was of higher intelligence by most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peoples 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reckoning. I'd have reservations as to who its real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; masters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and what its real goals might be. 
</em><br>
<p>Not to mention, is it really a higher intelligence?
<br>
There are many examples throughout history of
<br>
purported higher intelligence that turned up empty.
<br>
Let it prove itself by its actions...and then let the
<br>
results of those actions provide reason for or
<br>
against, probably against, servitude.  One can easily
<br>
imagine the first AI developing to the level of a
<br>
retarded, dogmatic child and then failing to
<br>
comprehend any way to, or justification for, progress
<br>
from that status.
<br>
<p>One can postulate truly hyperintelligent AIs.  But
<br>
then one has to posulate the results of their
<br>
actions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Could be the only way a hyper intelligent AI can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kick start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a rapid take off singularity is against the wishes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of voters. i.e. by brute military and or economic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through human proxies. That was my thought anyway.
</em><br>
<p>Or it could be that the only way it could do so is by
<br>
manipulating the wishes of a majority of voters, i.e.
<br>
by making self-improvement and deep research into how
<br>
to make people (including intelligences on the AI's
<br>
architecture) more intelligent seem super-cool and
<br>
ultra-popular, thus causing most of humanity to
<br>
become a self-improving group intelligence - kind of
<br>
like today, but much much faster.
<br>
<p>And if one compares today's rate of such improvement,
<br>
at least among scientific/industrialized societies,
<br>
to the rate one or two centuries back...
