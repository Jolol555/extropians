<p>Be quite careful here.  The basic distortion is that the corporation is 
<br>
granted the rights of a person, without simultaneous having the limits 
<br>
or obligations of a person.
<br>
<p>Limited Liability Corporations legitimately shield their investors from 
<br>
many liabilities for the actions in corporations that the investors 
<br>
theoretically have partial ownership in, but over which they actually 
<br>
neither have either reasonable control or detailed knowledge.  But I 
<br>
know of no ground for shielding the executives of the corporation from 
<br>
liability, as seems to be common practice.  And I also feel that the 
<br>
board of directors should be more liable.  And the individual employees, 
<br>
whether executives or not.  If a corporation pours poison in a 
<br>
communities drinking water, then the entire chain of personnel involved 
<br>
should be liable.  To the extent that they either knew or should have 
<br>
known.  And one scapegoat should not be allowed to exculpate the rest.
<br>
<p>This vile example is based on a case where company (Monsanto?) 
<br>
calculated that it would cost them less in fines to dump poison in a 
<br>
community's drinking water supply than it would to clean it up properly. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So they did.  And they were right.  Even though internal memos 
<br>
released during the trial showed that they had made this calculation 
<br>
ahead of time.  Personally I think this was ground for confiscating the 
<br>
entire corpation, and selling it for it's assets, and for sending most 
<br>
of the management and most of the directors to jail for premeditated 
<br>
murder and many of the staff to jail for accessory during the fact.  But 
<br>
they were, instead, given the fine which, as they had calculated, was 
<br>
less than the cost of cleaning things up properly was.
<br>
<p>As for the investors...most of them still don't know that it happened. 
<br>
And many don't even know that they are investors.  (Investment through 
<br>
market large cap funds, e.g.)  So while it's a reasonable penalty that 
<br>
they should loose their investment, they bear no real culpability.
