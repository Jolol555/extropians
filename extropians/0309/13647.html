<p>Interesting choice of words.  &quot;Tagging&quot; also refers to
<br>
grafitti which, when sprayed on non-public surfaces
<br>
one does not own or otherwise have permission to
<br>
deface, is vandalism, and therefore a property crime.
<br>
&quot;Yes, I can prove absolutely beyond any shadow of a
<br>
doubt that it was my car's windows that were broken.
<br>
But who broke 'em?&quot;
<br>
<p>There's also the little fact that possession is not
<br>
itself stopped by adding RFIDs and the like -
<br>
deterred, possibly, if the item will be held long
<br>
enough that scanners are likely to come looking
<br>
anywhere near the suspect.  But consumable goods can
<br>
be consumed (&quot;You're saying that was your gasoline?
<br>
Good luck proving it: it's fumes now.&quot;), small items
<br>
can have their IDs removed or disabled (though
<br>
anything $10K and up - like a car - and easily stolen
<br>
is often worthy enough of protection that it is
<br>
already &quot;tagged&quot;, or otherwise protected), and most
<br>
anything can be moved through the black market before
<br>
scanners come looking.
<br>
<p>Also, consider that most criminals give no thought to
<br>
what happens if they're caught.  In the same defiance
<br>
of rational thought that leads them to believe crime
<br>
pays in the long run, they usually simply believe they
<br>
won't be caught.  (There are exceptions, of course,
<br>
and for some criminals - usually the ones who think
<br>
clearly enough about this that they do not, in fact,
<br>
get caught - crime does pay.  But that's a small
<br>
fraction of the cases, since most people who think
<br>
that clearly tend to find far more profitable uses for
<br>
their time.)
