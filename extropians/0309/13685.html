</em><br>
<p>It still assumes that one group is the only one with access to a certain 
<br>
technology. In general this is not true. Even for nuclear weapons the 
<br>
monopoly was short-lived; the strong takeoff position claims that this 
<br>
is enough to make the monopoly last indefinitely, but I'm not so sure 
<br>
about that (or the strong takeoff). IMHO a much more plausible situation 
<br>
has AI of various calibers in the hands of many groups, and Joe just 
<br>
happens to have the most powerful one. What remains to be analysed is 
<br>
how much power that translates into. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Where in all this does the friendly bit of AI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get to emerge that is genuinely universally friendly? Seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it quite possibly doesn't. Universal friendliness is not something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the AI developers get a premium for &quot;growing from a seed&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>It seems likely that many would aim for something like friendliness, but 
<br>
indeed not universal friendliness. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Maybe one could make an analysis looking at different &quot;Gini
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coefficients&quot; of AI intelligence distribution. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry. Must plead ignorance to &quot;gini coefficients&quot; but some risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analysis sounds real healthy 'cause if it turns out that by running 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some fairly easy game theory notions that the first AI's are going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to face a backlash because they are not human and can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents or treated as persons (where would society draw the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; line?) then we may do well to look at the consequences for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on any singularity take off time. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think game theory says anything about a backlash, that is just 
<br>
psychology. As for the Gini coefficient, it is a measure of inequality. 
<br>
It is zero for a population where everyone is equal (all AIs have the 
<br>
same power) and one for a population of total inequality (one super AI, 
<br>
zero others): 
<br>
<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gini_coefficient</a>
<br>
<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GiniCoefficient.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GiniCoefficient.html</a>
<br>
<p><p>Imagine that having an AI of power P directly translates into social 
<br>
power; the social power SP of group number i with an AI is 
<br>
SP_i= P_i / sum_j P_j
<br>
If a group with social power can win over any group with lesser power, 
<br>
then the most powerful group (lets call it 1, and order them by 
<br>
power) can run everything is P_1 &gt; sum_j=2^N P_j. If we assume the 
<br>
powers follow a power law distribution P_j = c/j^k for some k&gt;0 this can 
<br>
happen above a certain k=K, where 2^(1-K)=K. So there is a range of 
<br>
power distributions that is not amenable to direct takeover.
<br>
<p>If we assume P grows exponentially over time (P'=lambda P) for everyone
<br>
there is no relative change in the analysis above, which is very 
<br>
interesting. If we only count AI power of course the first AI will be 
<br>
dominant even if it is Eliza; in reality social power has a non-AI 
<br>
factor F which we have to add in: SP_i = (P_i + F_i)/sum_j (P_j + F_j); 
<br>
it can be assumed to be constant and we can scale it to 1 for 
<br>
simplicity. A bit of equation fiddling does not seem to change things 
<br>
much. 
<br>
<p>But if the rate of growth is more than proportional to P_i (a Vingean 
<br>
singularity) or if the initial distrivution of the non-AI power is 
<br>
extreme, then the potential of monopolies increase. 
<br>
<p>This is worth looking into more detail, but now I have to go to lunch.
