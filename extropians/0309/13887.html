Thanks for the responses. I could be hallucinating, but I could swear 
<br>
the article was on slashdot.

</em><br>
<p>Agreed. Actually, I was interested in the 'cheerful libertarianism' 
<br>
thread, but am still reading Brin's article. I've heard Brin previously 
<br>
praise Star Trek for its take on gradual improvement of existing 
<br>
institutions (as opposed to the 'romantic' solutions of Star Wars or LOTR).
<br>
<p>Trying to synthesize in Robert Anton Wilson's notions of 'internalized 
<br>
strange loops', my (not claimed as original) concept of 'Temporal 
<br>
Pollution' discussed months ago, torturing children (per a recent post, 
<br>
something we can all agree is a bad thing, except that people have been 
<br>
torturing children (esp. girls) for millenia (and continue to do so)), 
<br>
and genocide, which seems the same way (agree it's bad, do it anyway).
<br>
<p>This somewhat dark mood perhaps due to recently viewing the anime 
<br>
Boogiepop Phantom, which (like much anime) tortures children, the motif 
<br>
of much anime seeming to me to be 1) there is something only you can do 
<br>
(often, pilot a giant mecha), and 2) people will suffer (or the world 
<br>
will be destroyed) if you don't do that and instead do what you want to 
<br>
do. Thinking of suicide as often a theme in anime, the movie 'The Virgin 
<br>
Suicides', thinking about the effect of being sued by the RIAA when 
<br>
you're a 12-year old girl...
<br>
<p>Mixing in thoughts about capitalism changing from 'let's produce a good 
<br>
or service and see if people will value it' to 'gaming the system', 
<br>
where you replace your workmen and engineers with lawyers, wondering if 
<br>
we aren't headed for some sort of deadlock, by which I mean perhaps 
<br>
humanity failed the Great Filter test, and we just haven't gotten to the 
<br>
consequences yet...
<br>
<p>The romance notions which Brin decries seem imho out of touch with where 
<br>
we find ourselves, as perhaps 'the last moral generation'. Seems to me 
<br>
that if we are in some higher powers' virtual reality, this would be an 
<br>
era of intense interest (pre-singualirity).
<br>
<p>I know little about neural nets, but understand that they can become 
<br>
deadlocked too in a sense, and need some sort of reset, and wondering if 
<br>
our civilization is the same way. Religion being perhaps the best 
<br>
example, with armageddon on one side and jihad on the other, it's hard 
<br>
to see how such an institution can be 'improved'.
<br>
<p>Anyway, discuss this brain fart among yourselves, I need to get back to 
<br>
work :-)
