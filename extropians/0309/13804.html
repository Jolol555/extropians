<br>
<p>had questioned the breakage scenario and mentioned a possibility of:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Way bad idea. imagine a scenario where a space elevator were placed =
</em><br>
into GEO with an altitude of 36,000 km (22,369 miles). If that happened
<br>
= to come loose, seperate, or &gt;&gt;otherwise have a problem with the orbit,
<br>
the = entire length would come crashing to Earth wrapping itself almost
<br>
= entirely around the planet. (circumference of 24901.55 miles at the
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;equator) This could be rather ugly.
</em><br>
<p>I understand this concern to have been a possibility raised in the early
<br>
days of beanstalk engineering and it was addressed in the faq from the
<br>
informational site.
<br>
<p>(main site at <a href="http://www.isr.us/SEHome.asp">http://www.isr.us/SEHome.asp</a> specific faq at
<br>
<a href="http://www.isr.us/SEScienceFAQs.asp#2">http://www.isr.us/SEScienceFAQs.asp#2</a> )
<br>
<p>What if it falls? 
<br>
<p>The majority, the long end out in space, gains enough speed that it
<br>
burns up in the atmosphere, with the lower portion falling into the sea.
<br>
It will not fall on top of anyone. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Additional breakage theories seem to generally indiate that the
<br>
remaining long portion will either be flung free via the earths
<br>
rotational momentem or be destroyed on re-entry. I dont think there is
<br>
anything to fear here about this concern although more detailed studies
<br>
should be part of any such project (perhaps even including a sacrificial
<br>
test stalk that is intentionally &quot;brought down&quot; while not yet fully
<br>
formed for some &quot;real world&quot; analysis)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Although the initial stalk could be a terror target there are 3 major
<br>
things which will operate against this:
<br>
1) the location will be somewhere in equatorial waters in a zone which
<br>
could be heavily patrolled and controlled. It would take signifigant
<br>
resources to penetrate that.
<br>
2) the obvious benefits of the structure and the &quot;global&quot; usage it would
<br>
provide would tend to limit focus by &quot;special interest&quot; groups as they
<br>
would have no specific &quot;owner&quot; to hate 
<br>
3) After construction of the initial stalk the plan is for additional
<br>
stalks (at different locations) to be quickly built. Even if one was
<br>
taken out there would be other stalks present and more could be quickly
<br>
built. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Check out the site more throughly and have a look at the concepts and
<br>
FAQ's (also see specifically
<br>
<a href="http://www.isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/contents.html">http://www.isr.us/Downloads/niac_pdf/contents.html</a> for some in-depth
<br>
analysis performed for NASA) I think you'll find many of your concerns
<br>
answered.
