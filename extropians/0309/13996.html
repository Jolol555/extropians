<p>
Regarding cancer rates and exposure to toxins, I recently came across an 
<br>
article in Scientific American looking at the phenomenon of hormesis and 
<br>
how the developing understanding of it may play a role in better 
<br>
appreciating the body's ability to deal with toxins. There was a question 
<br>
raised in the article about how such research, admittedly ongoing, may 
<br>
influence public policy vis-a-vis environmental regulation, etc.
<br>
<p>I am wondering what others may think of such research and its prospects for 
<br>
both better understanding the processes by which we succumb to accrued 
<br>
damage of toxic exposure (resulting, I would suppose, in cancers of various 
<br>
kinds, amongst other conditions) and for formulating wise policy to guard 
<br>
against it where possible.
<br>
<p>I had originally learned of hormesis a while ago in a discussion of 
<br>
Rosalind Yallow's work on radiation exposure, in the book &quot;I Wish I'd Made 
<br>
You Angry Earlier&quot;, and had long wondered what ongoing research had learned 
<br>
about it since then. I had intended to ask Peter Doherty for his view on 
<br>
such matters last Friday, but was feeling a bit blah and missed attending 
<br>
the function he was at.
<br>
