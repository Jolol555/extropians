Already I fail my resolution to avoid posting on
<br>
any political topic.  Stifling the urge to post
<br>
about the current state governor quagmire has raised
<br>
my blood pressure by about an atmosphere.  OK just 
<br>
this one, then its back to strict list discipline.

</em><br>
<p><p>You are too kind, Brett, but in this case, yes I am 
<br>
serious.  In the last election I noted that the poll 
<br>
workers were asking for only signatures when picking
<br>
up the ballots, but were not doing *any* checking
<br>
against previous signatures.  I produced my driver's
<br>
license, which they refuse to look at, and informed
<br>
me that they were specifically *forbidden* to request
<br>
*any* personal identification, at which time I asked
<br>
what measures, if any, were being taken to discourage
<br>
massive voter fraud.  There were absolutely none.  
<br>
The discussion began to grow mildly heated, as I pointed
<br>
out that the results of this &quot;election&quot; were nothing
<br>
more than a casual opinion poll, except with a higher
<br>
uncertainty rating and muuuuch higher stakes.  Then I 
<br>
realized I was preaching to the choir.  These were simply 
<br>
innocent volunteer poll workers, so there was no point
<br>
in spoiling their day.
<br>
<p>Historians may now claim that the current president 
<br>
won the election by a landslide because the results 
<br>
from Taxifornia were invalid.
<br>
<p>On the bright side, Our governor is hoping to save his
<br>
job by allowing illegal immigrants to get a valid 
<br>
Taxifornia driver's license.  They have pulled out the 
<br>
requirement for fingerprints or any other biometric, 
<br>
(privacy concerns and all that) so all I need to do is claim
<br>
to be an illegal immigrant from Canada in order to get 
<br>
a convenient second drivers license with another ID number 
<br>
and address for use whenever I am pulled over by the 
<br>
boys in blue.  Those who have lost driver's privileges
<br>
for any reason can do likewise, then transfer the 
<br>
license to another state in order to avoid a cloud
<br>
of suspicion, like all Taxifornia licenses will soon
<br>
have. 
<br>
<p>Ah, my blood pressure has just dropped by several hundred
<br>
torr, just venting that one paragraph.  {8-]
