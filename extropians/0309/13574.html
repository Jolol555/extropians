<p>
<em>&gt;Which countries have the most friendly policies?
</em><br>
<p>Barbara,
<br>
<p>My best guess from observations, is the smaller the better, and
<br>
in the direction of central and Eastern Europe.
<br>
<p>A more general discussion-
<br>
<p>I'm sure that you know that within the EU, travel (business and
<br>
pleasure) generally doesn't require passports or papers, with the
<br>
exception of Great Britain, where you need to show a passport upon
<br>
entering from other EU countries. This ease-of-travel legally
<br>
supercedes the laws of the individual countries. (I used this when I
<br>
was waiting five months for my Italian permesso di soggiorno, not
<br>
legally permitted by Italian laws, to leave Italy, but I needed
<br>
to attend work meetings elsewhere in the EU). This is perhaps similar
<br>
to traveling within the U.S., but you'll still find wide variations in
<br>
the rules and customs of the EU member countries when you need to
<br>
stay longer for work and living.
<br>
<p>So that kind of ease-of-travel is an incentive to keeping work
<br>
within the EU member countries. I found, so far that the nearby
<br>
nonEU countries (central and eastern Europe) are also easy to travel
<br>
to/from for work and pleasure, also given either a US passport,
<br>
or an EU passport.
<br>
<p>I don't know what are the rules for living longer than three months
<br>
in each of the EU member countries, but now after my experience in
<br>
Italy, Germany was a breeze. The only necessary document in Germany
<br>
was a work visa, which is dependent upon having a job and health
<br>
insurance (no exceptions). With that document you can generally live
<br>
and work as any other person in that society.  That is, rent a flat,
<br>
work, see a doctor, own a car, attend classes or university, open a
<br>
bank account. You can't vote unless you're a citizen, as usual.
<br>
<p>I have a colleague who took a sabbatical this past winter in France,
<br>
and it seemed to be difficult, workwise, for him, using his old US
<br>
habits. In France, his work Institute closed on the weekends, and he
<br>
needed to climb over the locked fence to get into the Institute
<br>
building to do his work on a Saturday or Sunday. My experience in
<br>
Germany and other places working in Northern Europe (Italy too), is
<br>
that I was never 'locked out' of doing my work on the weekends (even
<br>
though it is not typical).
<br>
<p>Italy is the other extreme than Germany for living long-term as
<br>
nonEU person. The country seems to be moving through a xenophobic phase
<br>
now with new laws in place in the last year for foreigners, perhaps not
<br>
so different from the U.S.'s INS (but in Italy the laws 'bend'). You
<br>
cannot live in Italy for more than 3 months without  a work visa (15
<br>
steps involved, some months to achieve), and also a permesso di
<br>
soggiorno (another 15 steps involved, five months to achieve). That
<br>
gets you working in the country, but you still must have a residenza
<br>
certificate (another few weeks to achieve, say) to open a bank
<br>
account, own a car, have a credit card. The next piece of paper for
<br>
owning property, say, is an Italian Identity Card, which requires
<br>
all previous pieces of paper. In another week, I will likely have the
<br>
last document, but I've been working at these pieces of paper now for
<br>
one year, involved with three different Italian police agencies
<br>
(Carabinieri, Questura, Local Municipal Police), City Hall, and
<br>
assorted other agencies. Note that if you are alone, you are not
<br>
knowledgeable about 'Italian ways' and don't know that each rule and
<br>
law can be interpreted in an infinite number of ways, and so will
<br>
appear as a stupid foreigner and the law won't bend for you. That
<br>
is, you will have to acquire an order of magnitude more stamps,
<br>
signatures, and approvals than the average Italian. Italy runs on
<br>
pieces of stamped papers, and not very well, I might add.
<br>
<p>I'm asking questions of foreigners working in other EU countries,
<br>
more for curiosity, however, since I'm set on being in Italy for a
<br>
long while.  I think I've experienced some extremes of the spectrum
<br>
for working and living conditions in Europe.
<br>
<p>Amara
<br>
<p>(P.S. starting next May, my Latvian passport makes my life in the EU
<br>
considerably easier, in terms of paperwork.)
