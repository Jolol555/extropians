<p><em>&gt;It MAY be that cancer is more likely to happen because we're getting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;older, we KNOW that there are more polutants around.  We KNOW that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pollutants cause cancer.  We don't KNOW that age does.  Although it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems tautological - if increased exposure to pollutants 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causes cancer, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then the longer you are exposed to them, the more likely you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancer, hence the older you are, the more likely you are, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Incorrect, merely existing longer makes you more likely to get cancer,
<br>
regardless of pollutants or carcinogens or ionizing radiation.  The
<br>
cellular DNA copying systems are not perfect, and the more times they
<br>
copy the more likely they are to make a mistake.  Additionally, there is
<br>
a limit to the number of times a cell can copy itself, this was likely
<br>
evolved as a mechanism to delay the onset of cancer past reproductive
<br>
ages.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While the conjecture is an important one, it doesn't make it more than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a contributing factor - GIVEN that we KNOW that increased stress, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pollutants, alcohol, tobacco, smog, heavy-metals, food-poisons, etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are cancer-causing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, small amounts of stress and pollutants actually
<br>
decrease the likelyhood of getting cancer, as it puts into action stress
<br>
repair mechanisms that are inactive at lower levels.  Refer to this
<br>
months special issue of Scientific American, which has an article about
<br>
the effect.  Some CR practitioners accomplish CR by eating every other
<br>
day, but eating normally on those days, as (they say) it enacts the
<br>
stress mechanisms associated with slowing the rate of aging and delaying
<br>
the onset of cancers.  That scientific American article infacts suggests
<br>
that the very stringent pollutants requirements in post industrialized
<br>
nations actually cause more cancers then if they were slightly less
<br>
stringent.  Although there is a point where the cancer incidinces
<br>
increase with stress levels / exposure rates.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Quick quiz:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Which is more likely to cause cancer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_extended exposure to tar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_being over 95
</em><br>
<p>Being over 95
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Which is more likely to cause cancer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_ Being over 35
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_ Being a long-term Smoker over 35
</em><br>
<p>Being a long term smoker over 35
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Which is more likely to cause cancer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_ Exposure to radioactive materials
</em><br>
<em>&gt;_ genetic disposition to cancer
</em><br>
<p>Depends on the dose, but probably a genetic predisposition, as 50% of
<br>
all people who have cancer have, for starters, a mutation in the p53
<br>
gene.
<br>
<p>The general public's understanding of carcinogenic threats is pretty
<br>
much opposite of the real threats.  An average young adult who drinks
<br>
and smokes socially will probably get cancer from his drinking, not his
<br>
smoking.  The vast majority of cancer causing agents are *natural* as
<br>
plants prefer not to be eaten, and have evolved millions of natural
<br>
pesticides, most of which have never seen the inside of an EPA lab.  A
<br>
single veggie may contain more natural and carcinogenic pesticides then
<br>
you will consume as an average american of synthetic carcinogenic
<br>
pesticides over your entire life, yet so far the EPA only tests
<br>
synthetic ones.  Refer to the HERP index sometime, a single glass of
<br>
beer has 300 times the cancer causing agents that a typical
<br>
industrialized agriculture apple does.  Coffee is even worse.  And
<br>
people who are thin and health have far lower incidences of cancer, even
<br>
though they are subjected to the same environmental barrage.  Diet is
<br>
the single most influential controllable factor, far more so than
<br>
radiation or pollutants, by orders of magnitude.
