<p>Brett, it depends to some extent on whether AI and nanotech coevolve.
<br>
AI+Nanotech allows people to live essentially for &quot;free&quot; (perhaps even
<br>
advanced biotech can pull that rabbit out of the hat).  AIs alone --
<br>
if they are &quot;owned&quot; (now we get to start an AI &quot;slavery&quot; discussion) and
<br>
skilled and in demand might allow one to live for free as well.
<br>
Alternatively, nanotech alone, if there are a sufficient number of
<br>
nanotechnologists and/or computers doing the design work might
<br>
allow one to live for free.  So there need not be a &quot;huge backlash&quot;.
<br>
<p>I also tend to disagree that one needs human proxies to support most
<br>
AI work.  One does need the computer resources and interfaces to
<br>
reality but after that I think humans are out of the loop.  I only
<br>
need to interface my AI to my bank and/or broker accounts and then
<br>
after that I can ignore it except to check up on things from time to
<br>
time.  Of course one has to trust the AI and the interfaces but
<br>
one would hope we are getting better at developing such things.
<br>
<p>However there are significant risks that arise if an amoral AI cracks
<br>
a virtual private network -- such as the Kazaa network and installs
<br>
itself on millions of machines.  The last month has clear demonstrated
<br>
that security holes provide the means for viruses and worms to capture
<br>
millions of machines in a brief period of time.
<br>
<p>How long before someone produces an evolving virus/worm, perhaps akin
<br>
to the various evolving SPAM messages, that can defeat the anti-virus
<br>
filters?  Put an amoral AI on top of that and you potentially have a
<br>
*real* problem.  One way to look at the script-kiddies of today is
<br>
to view them as really limited AIs.  So look at the problems they cause
<br>
and then imagine what happens if they transfer their limited intelligence
<br>
into the millions of machines that are vulnerable.
<br>
