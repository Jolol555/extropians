<em>&gt;-----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From: Randall Randall
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Great, so who ever has bigger guns wins out.  And why do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;call this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; 'peacefull' anarchy exactly?  And how is this any better than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; current post-industrialize west system?  Do you not think a local 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; warlord pointing a gun at your face to take some of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;food you grew 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; on your farm is 'alienation of labor'?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Straw man.  He said he was for anarchy; your question implies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a State (the local warlord), in a way that suggests you think 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is really what he wants.
</em><br>
<p>To assert that an anarchy will always remain an equal division of threat
<br>
and power is absurd.  I feel it reasonable to assume smaller and smaller
<br>
groups will amass more and more power, leading to war lords and fuedel
<br>
asque societies.  I do not prefer to live in a society ruled only by the
<br>
barrel of a Gun.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Personally, I regard the State as nothing more than very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;successful criminals.  Therefore, we don't have a perfectly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;peaceful anarchy as long as there is anyone performing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;functions similar to the State (murder, theft, kidnapping, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;etc).  Nevertheless, I am sure that it's possible to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;closer than we are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I don't exactly want to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; an arsenal, can I pay someone else to do it and ensure no one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; threatens me with their aresenal?  Isnt that, in a way, what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ready doing with my taxes?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, it isn't.  If it were,...
</em><br>
<p>The point I am trying to make is that if a in an anarchist society,
<br>
someone provides protection as a service, then the good ol economics of
<br>
scale will come into play, and the larger protection groups will provide
<br>
better protection for less cost.  Eventually, one or two of them will
<br>
have the vast majority of the clientelle, really not functionally much
<br>
different from a minarchist state.  How would such a growth of power be
<br>
stopped in a 'peaceful anarchy' or anarchy socialist (I imaging it
<br>
wouldn't be any issue in an anarcho-capitalist society)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; After all, if someone comes up to me with a gun, I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; those people I pay, and they are hear to drag off the gun toting nut
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; keep him, basically, from f-ing with me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Have you tried that? :)  In practice, what they do is exact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;revenge on those who f-ed with you. Once in a while.  If they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find them.  To make it clearer that protection is not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;goal, they make it difficult to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protect yourself, too.   Even if they successfully exact revenge upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your attacker, however, it won't help *you*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>A much more complex issue I don't feel to delve into.  As a minarchist
<br>
liberterian, I would probably agree with the vast majority of your
<br>
complaints of government.  In most of the comments, I am trying to
<br>
understand Robbie's position, not presenting my own theory of moral
<br>
statehood.
