<p>Robocop spy-cam speaks for itself
<br>
By Andrew Johnson
<br>
<p>14 September 2003
<br>
<p>It is the snooper that speaks before anyone has the chance to step out of 
<br>
line.
<br>
<p>A cross between Big Brother and Robocop, it barks orders at would-be 
<br>
vandals, graffiti artists and drug users.
<br>
<p>British Transport Police and two local authorities are experimenting with 
<br>
revolutionary cameras which can spot when people are not where they should be.
<br>
<p>The Flash Cam 530 takes its photographs with an intense flash that can 
<br>
read a car number plate in the pitch dark from 100 yards, and then issues 
<br>
a stern 15-second Robocop-style spoken instruction to leave the area.
<br>
<p>Steve Galinsky, who started importing the cameras from America in May, 
<br>
said: &quot;We have seven on trial across the country. Easington Council in 
<br>
County Durham is using them to stop fly-tipping. We've had no prosecutions 
<br>
so far, but no fly-tipping either.&quot;
<br>
<p>British Transport Police has three cameras, two standing guard at 
<br>
Worcester's Shrub Hill station and one in Leamington Spa station, to stop 
<br>
graffiti vandals.
<br>
<p>There is another at the memorial site to the victims of last year's rail 
<br>
crash in Potters Bar. Would-be vandals are told: &quot;This is a dedicated 
<br>
memorial site. Please leave now. Your photograph has been taken and may be 
<br>
used to prosecute you.&quot;
<br>
<p>In Camden, north London, drug addicts hear: &quot;Please leave now if you have 
<br>
no business in this area. Your photograph has been taken and if you are 
<br>
conducting an illegal activity you will be prosecuted.&quot;
<br>
<p>Mr Galinsky said Scotland Yard was in discussions over the cameras being 
<br>
installed throughout London. Westminster Council is considering a trial in 
<br>
central London.
