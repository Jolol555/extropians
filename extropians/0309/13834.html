<em>&gt;&gt; Example: if I fail to deliver a piece of equipment to you on monday
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; because some troglodytes were cutting off the road and I didn't feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; like running the gauntlet, then according to your moral system I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; should be blamed because obliged due to contract?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Of course.
</em><br>
<p>then your moral system has no basis.  My life is more valuable than the 
<br>
fulfillment of your contracts.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;  A contract must be explicit to be enforced.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ### Ashamed, perhaps. Blamed - well, it depends on the local customs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding the duties of guardians of prepersons. Such customs should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficiently simple and well-known to allow expectations to form, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time they should be subject (largely) to choice, by both parents 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to a lesser degree) their children, e.g. by the expedient of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; polycentric
</em><br>
<em>&gt; law.
</em><br>
<p>Directly contradicting your statement above.
<br>
<p>Rafal - Contracts are pretty far down on the morality chain.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Similarly economic contracts tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be backed by force and coercion either explicitly or implicitly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### See medieval merchant law. Ostracism is not coercion, but is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective at enforcing many contracts.
</em><br>
<p>Ostracism is a form of coercion - &quot;Leave your house OR ELSE&quot;.
<br>
<p>If you want to redefine coercion for your little moral system, go for 
<br>
it, just don't expect anyone else to follow you down the road.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### This would not be coercion, unless you are talking about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-market,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monopoly situations - such as a communist economy, or a statist 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plutocracy.
</em><br>
<p>Word games, entertaining to children, annoying to adults.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -----------------------------------
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; ### It is not my prerogative to define other sentients'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; self-interest for them. I can however hypothesize that it is,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; similar to mine, the achievement of whatever goals they act to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; achieve, ideally in the presence of sufficient information needed to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; evaluate those goals in reference to other goals they strive for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Therefore, &quot;goodness&quot; is for me getting what humans really want, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; the ideal society is the one that best serves the achievement of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; average Rawlsian human's goals, including my own personal goals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Goodness is then defined in the context of my self-interest, not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; other way around.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Getting what WHICH humans really want?  If your predictive statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Goodness is what tends to produce good results in the long-run&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### My statement goes &quot;Social goodness is whatever tends to get me and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others most of what I and they want&quot;. For most well-informed, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low-emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persons this will mean absolute (not relative) economic success under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions of personal liberty.
</em><br>
<p>The project of defining morality by &quot;what most people want&quot; is hopeless 
<br>
and silly, you can see yourself going down that path here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Nah, most people want to gain. Whether it occurs at other people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expense, is a minor secondary consideration. In fact, with the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exception of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; egalitarians, who see the gain of others as an affront to themselves, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would prefer to even personally lose if it's needed to ruin others, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people would rather gain *and* profit others at the same time. It feels
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better, I can tell you that.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Most People&quot; are smart enough to know that if you take someone else's 
<br>
job, they lose it.  That's called gaining at someone else's expense.  
<br>
If they're ignorant of this rule, they were poorly brought up.  You may 
<br>
ignorantly think that you can acquire billions and billions of dollars 
<br>
without actually hurting anyone, but that just makes you ignorant, 
<br>
certainly not moral.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; &quot;Most People&quot; don't agree about what they want - shoot, most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't even know what they want themselves.  But just about EVERYBODY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can tell you whether or not you should torture children.  Good is much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more concrete than this abstract &quot;what people want&quot; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Certain procedures are good at finding out what people want. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; includes the free market, demarchy, Borda count and a few other tricks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These define good much better than whatever you or I could elaborate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own. Nothing abstract about it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we clearly don't agree on what most people want, do we agree that 
<br>
it's bad to torture children?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Definitely.  On the part of a few very wealthy and powerful people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have had and continue to have extraordinary power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### This world is not made for and by elites. Masses of all kinds of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labored for centuries to build what we have, and AFAIK there are no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Illuminati, effective conspiracies, and worldwide cabals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess we differ here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No Elders of Zion, either.
</em><br>
<p>Stop being stupid.
<br>
<p>Is there a Queen of England?  A Bank of England?  A Barclays?  An FMR 
<br>
Corporation?
<br>
<p>I don't know anything about kabal/illuminati/etc.  I do know that the 
<br>
wealthy use their power to keep their power and that has NEVER EVER 
<br>
CHANGED.  Has it?
<br>
<p>Can you site examples for us when the wealthy have decided voluntarily 
<br>
to let the lower-and-middle-classes share in their power?
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>robbie
