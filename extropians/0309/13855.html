<em>&gt;Let's see your legitimate &quot;poverty is in decline&quot; source.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Study finds that globalization cures poverty&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;While acknowledging the number of poor people in the world remains
<br>
&quot;disturbingly high,&quot; the study says that in 1950 about 55% of the
<br>
world's
<br>
population lived on less than US$1 a day (in constant,
<br>
inflation-adjusted
<br>
dollars). By 1992, only 24% of the world's population had to make do
<br>
with
<br>
that tiny amount.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The proportion of the world's population living in absolute poverty is
<br>
lower now than it has ever been,&quot; the report says.&quot;

<p>Apparently, National post limits the time it archives files.  You can
<br>
find the article mirrored on my site...

<br>
<p>I am sure you can find the original study if so inclined.  Do you have a
<br>
study suggesting that poverty is higher than it has ever been before as
<br>
a percentage of the population?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Poverty is NOT less than 20% - even in the United States.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;poverty&quot; is, of course, relative.  Define what you mean by it.  As of
<br>
1992, per this study, the global figure was at 24%, defined as $1 US
<br>
dollar per day.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ### You know I am a staunch opponent of coercion. I will benefit only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people working for their own gain, freely, such as the Nike 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;workers in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wherever they are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So are you just ignorant of the political repression in Burma that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;causes them to be subject to abject poverty and willing to take shitty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;jobs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Burma?  From the CIA world fact book
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bm.html">http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bm.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Burma is a resource-rich country that suffers from abject rural
<br>
poverty. The military regime took steps in the early 1990s to liberalize
<br>
the economy after decades of failure under the &quot;Burmese Way to
<br>
Socialism&quot;, but those efforts have since stalled. Burma has been unable
<br>
to achieve monetary or fiscal stability, resulting in an economy that
<br>
suffers from serious macroeconomic imbalances - including a steep
<br>
inflation rate and an official exchange rate that overvalues the Burmese
<br>
kyat by more than 100 times the market rate. In addition, most overseas
<br>
development assistance ceased after the junta suppressed the democracy
<br>
movement in 1988 and subsequently ignored the results of the 1990
<br>
election. Burma is data poor, and official statistics are often dated
<br>
and inaccurate. Published estimates of Burma's foreign trade are greatly
<br>
understated because of the size of the black market and border trade -
<br>
often estimated to be one to two times the official economy.&quot;
<br>
<p>You act as if their choice appears to be a shitty job as a factory
<br>
worker or a non-shitty job as something other than a factory worker.  It
<br>
in fact appears their choices are shitty job as a factory work or
<br>
starving to death.  I know little of Burma, but this seems typical of
<br>
oppressive closed societies, do you have knowledge suggesting the
<br>
poverty in burma is FROM the multinational conglomerates?
<br>
<p>Population below poverty line = 25%
<br>
<p>No doubt the perpetuation of poverty is a complex issue, but lets not
<br>
forget that at the very least before agriculture and civilization
<br>
*everyone* was below poverty level, perpetually on the verge of
<br>
starvation.  I have read suggestions that at one point some 10's of
<br>
thousands of years ago the entire adult breeding population was as low
<br>
as 1,000 people.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
