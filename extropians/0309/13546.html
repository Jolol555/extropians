</em><br>
<p>Do you think that the &quot;pointlessness of engaging in political debates&quot; 
<br>
is rooted in the basically violent nature of politics?
<br>
<p>I mean, debate is meant to have a changing effect.  If people don't 
<br>
want to change, they don't want to have debates.
<br>
<p>Only the &quot;active but weak&quot; side of an issue wants to have a debate 
<br>
about it.   The strong side doesn't debate, they use weapons and force. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;passive&quot; side just wants things to stay as they are, and so any 
<br>
debate about it is undesirable.
<br>
<p>It is therefore left to the progressives, the ones who want to see 
<br>
change for the positive but who are unwilling to use force to get it to 
<br>
actually carry out the detailed and often painful business of carrying 
<br>
on debates.
<br>
<p>But as Samantha so eloquently pointed out, Extropians SHOULD be 
<br>
interested in peaceful resolutions of conflicts, for which as far as I 
<br>
know, the only methods in existence are civil disobedience and debate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -- they are rooted
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; make those &quot;disappear&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>While I agree - people only know what they know - and they only know 
<br>
what they know by paying attention to the things that they can pay 
<br>
attention to, etc. , I don't draw the same conclusion.  The conclusion 
<br>
I draw is that it's interesting to find out what the experiences of the 
<br>
other person are that root their political positions.
<br>
<p>Still waiting to hear from Mr. Burch in a civil manner what experiences 
<br>
back the use of the term &quot;Forced&quot; in relation to why the US went to war 
<br>
with Iraq as in &quot;The US was 'forced' to go to war with Iraq&quot;.
<br>
<p>I would say that particular branch had taken a turn for the better, 
<br>
wouldn't you?  We'd gotten quickly to the heart of the matter and were 
<br>
even civil about it.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
