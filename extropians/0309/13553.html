Ok, Greg, I'll wade into these waters (though I realize it is
<br>
probably foolish to do so).  [Someday, the Extropian List Principles
<br>
should include a list of people that one should never never
<br>
argue with.]

<p><em>&gt; [big snip] Islam -- at least the Islam practiced in important parts

<em>&gt; of the world -- has never put down the sword.  Much more violent clashes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between Islam and the Enlightened world are yet to come.
</em><br>
<p>*But* *why* does one not see the violence associated with Islam with
<br>
say Hinduism or Buddhism or even Catholicism?  (Mind you I did see
<br>
a news program the other night where it appeared that two Buddhist
<br>
sects or perhaps some individuals v. a sect were fighting against
<br>
one another in Japan.)  Probably not too different from the differences
<br>
between the Sunni and the Shiites in Iraq.
<br>
<p>IMO, the problem does not go back to &quot;religions&quot; but genetic &quot;tribalism&quot;.
<br>
<p>So it would require a very well referenced paper distributed worldwide
<br>
to even begin to resolve some of these problems.  Really -- can you
<br>
even imagine Buddhist individuals/sects actually *fighting* against
<br>
one another?  They just don't *do* that kind of thing.
<br>
<p>And how can you even take the position that there is a real &quot;debate&quot;
<br>
going on?  I can see the &quot;Islamic&quot; world -- though I do not know why
<br>
it may be more violent than the &quot;Hindu&quot; world.  But I consider probably
<br>
most of what you consider to be an &quot;Enlightened&quot; world, i.e. a world
<br>
where there are &quot;laws&quot; and &quot;justice&quot; to be extremely under the influence
<br>
of ca-ca written in the Bible (therefore null and void).  In all of
<br>
the cases they have *NOT* thought things through.
<br>
<p>I have realized that there are close personal friends whom I cherish who
<br>
may pick up the Bible and become &quot;believers&quot; as well as intellectuals such
<br>
as C. S. Lewis who may go through the same transformation.  In the back of
<br>
my mind the only explanation I can find is that they desire &quot;hope&quot; over
<br>
rational thought processes.
<br>
<p>I must admit, &quot;hope&quot; tends to be more satisfying.  And because of that
<br>
possible fact we may be doomed to deal with individuals who will
<br>
sacrifice themselves for what they view as a &quot;better&quot; world.
<br>
And the &quot;rational&quot; among us may suffer as a result.
<br>
<p>As I pointed out -- most of us are not trained to engage in &quot;rational&quot;
<br>
debate.
<br>
<p>R.
