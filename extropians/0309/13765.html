-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Robert J. Bradbury
<br>
<p>Zubrin also botched the entire &quot;development of Mars&quot; concept ...He does
<br>
not &quot;get&quot; nanotech and does not &quot;get&quot; the O'Neill vision of living in
<br>
space colonies...
<br>
<p><p>Agreed, however he makes an assumption right up front
<br>
in his Case for Mars to assume *only* current (1996)
<br>
proven technology.  Nanotech isn't there yet.  
<br>
<p>I mentioned nanotech to him at a conference of Doctors 
<br>
for Disaster Preparedness.  He must have been shocked at 
<br>
that one, for it was perhaps the only conference where he 
<br>
spoke and was not mobbed by admirers.  He was just in the
<br>
wrong place: DDP is an association of physicians who
<br>
ponder how to survive and help others in the event of
<br>
a nuclear war.  I do not know why Zubrin was speaking
<br>
at that, but I took advantage of the opportunity.  I
<br>
got his undivided attention for about half an hour.
<br>
<p>In any case, he isn't a nanotech believer.
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;The Mars atmosphere is essentially useless for things one would like to
<br>
use atmospheres for (providing atmospheric pressure, shielding from UV
<br>
rays, providing CO2 for plant life, etc.)...
<br>
<p>Robert
<br>
<p><p>Mars' atmosphere is good for *some* of the things
<br>
we need atmospheres for.  Granted it doesn't provide
<br>
pressure or shielding, only cursed dust storms.  However
<br>
it is a carbon source, and might provide *some* water,
<br>
two things that are in way short supply on the moon.
