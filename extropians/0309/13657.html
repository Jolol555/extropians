I believe that probation is a voluntary agreement between the state
<br>
and the prisoner.  Anyone has the choice to turn down probation and
<br>
remain in prison until the end of their term, at which point they will
<br>
be released and retain whatever rights and restrictions are common to
<br>
former prisoners.
<br>
<p>Since most people strongly dislike prison, the state has tremendous
<br>
leverage in the bargaining over probation and can essentially dictate
<br>
the terms.  But that doesn't change the fact that probation is in effect
<br>
a favor to the prisoner, letting him out early, and whatever restrictions
<br>
are in place are typically less onerous than the alternative which is
<br>
to remain in jail.
<br>
<p>Now, as a matter of policy, we may prefer to require our law enforcement
<br>
agents to offer consistent and fair probation terms, and it is possible
<br>
that this case represents a violation of what (some) people would
<br>
prefer to see as policy.  But I don't see harsh probation terms as a
<br>
rights violation.
