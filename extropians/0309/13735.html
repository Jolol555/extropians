Subject: Re: religion: dalai lama
<br>
<p>I believe the proper address is &quot;Your Holiness&quot;.  I went to hear him
<br>
speak in 1996 in Bloomington, IN. It was great to see him in person, but
<br>
I didn't get to speak to him personally.   krs
<br>
<p><p>I was in the general area where they were having a 
<br>
major hootenanny for him, perhaps it should be called a
<br>
lamananny.  We were at North Beach, the City Lights
<br>
bookstore, looking for a definition of the term
<br>
&quot;hipster daddio&quot; as used by Kerouac, et.al.  I did 
<br>
not find an actual definition, but I did see what I
<br>
believe were several excellent hip examples.
<br>
<p>I don't believe we saw the dalai lama himself however. 
<br>
He would be hard to miss, for I believe a lama is 
<br>
about halfway between a goat and a camel, or perhaps 
<br>
halfway between a giraffe and a yak.  We saw nothing 
<br>
that looked even vaguely like that, even tho we stood
<br>
about gawking like a couple of prairy chickens, or 
<br>
like Ma and Pa Walton taking a vacation in the big city.  
<br>
<p>The bookstore was a kick.  I feel way hip now, man.
