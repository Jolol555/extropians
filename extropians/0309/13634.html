<em>&gt; &gt; Could be the only way a hyper intelligent AI can kick start
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a rapid take off singularity is against the wishes of a majority
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of voters. i.e. by brute military and or economic force and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; through human proxies. That was my thought anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do others see a problem with this reasoning or conclusion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It wouldn't be a matter of submitting to a dictatorship.  It 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a matter of choosing to go along with overwhelmingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; successful forces affecting your world, or suffering the natural 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consequences of resisting or being left behind.
</em><br>
<p>It seems like Joe the human proxy who is allowed to make purchases
<br>
etc using the AI's judgement perhaps because Joe reared the AI
<br>
is a substanial competitive threat. Society is likely to see Joe as 
<br>
equipped with a new form of super tool, that could undermine a
<br>
lot of power basis rather than automatically move to grant the AI
<br>
personhood (as in say Bicentential Man) or even a back account
<br>
where the AI can sell services in its own right.
<br>
<p>Wouldn't governments concerned about jobs and the economy 
<br>
be tempted to move in to counter Joe's tool? Or perhaps to 
<br>
compulsorily acquire it. The AI has no human rights and it would
<br>
be scaring a lot of folks that it was outperforming as would Joe
<br>
its intermediary who can trade or own IP. The temptation to 
<br>
take out the AI with industrial espionage may be very strong.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
