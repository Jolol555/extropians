<p>No, he's saying that right backed by might makes more right.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, even if that's sometimes true, it's also well

established that using might to propagate right often has the dismal
<br>
consequence that exercise of might *corrodes* or *subverts* the right it's
<br>
meant to be protecting and enforcing. Cf. certain parts of the world today.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;There are all manner of supposedly &quot;higher purposes&quot; in the world.  Which

</em><br>
<p>That's more to the point, surely. It's a matter of mutual prudential
<br>
stand-off. We can't be utterly *certain* that what we regard as right
<br>
really is (although preventing the stoning of death of a pregnant rape
<br>
victim comes close--by *our* standards). More forcefully, we can't be
<br>
utterly certain that we'll always be mightier than those with different
<br>
opinions. We're back to certainty as a negative epistemological thesis (as
<br>
I put it in my posted 40-year-old essay on political values, entirely
<br>
ignored by the list), and to game strategy.
