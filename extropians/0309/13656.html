<p>Are you sure that's a small fraction of the cases? People always say that
<br>
criminals are dumb, but I think the sample might be skewed by only being
<br>
able to measure those who are caught. So much property is stolen, for
<br>
instance, and never returned, so that it seems to me that most theft is
<br>
actually completely successful.
