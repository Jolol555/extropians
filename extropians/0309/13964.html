<em>&gt;-----Original Message-----

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; IF a child is born with four of the five
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; required mutations *in every cell of his body* he will probably get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cancer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; In short, it does explain it, you just don't understand it.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suggest 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; you refrain from making assertive comments of areas where you do not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; have sufficient background knowledge to be that assertive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suggest we may have a disagreement about what &quot;probably&quot; means.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now I'm no doctor but I can tell the difference between &quot;Will&quot; and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Might&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Can you?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Yet your knowledge of cancer is way off.  Do you or do you not
<br>
acknowledge that?  I note you ignore the entire theme of the message,
<br>
and just focus on my saying 'probably'  I don't disagree with you what
<br>
'probably' means, this is an issue you and Robert Bradbury have in
<br>
terminology, my issue was your suggestion that the large rise in cancer
<br>
we are seeing is from pollution.  Do you still hold that opinion?

<p><em>&gt;But not the average maximum life span - still around 110-120 years.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>You keep tossing red herrings into the debates, but never acknowledge
<br>
the points all ready discussed.  Do you still hold the opinion that if
<br>
plants caused cancer then people of the past should have gotten cancer,
<br>
and therefore plants do not cause cancer?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Why is it such a controversial proposition that the noxious fumes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;radioactive waste, heavy metals and other KNOWN CARCINOGENS that we 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;100,000,000 tonnes/year are killing us because they are carcinogenic?
</em><br>
<p>It is not controversial, no doubt that is the case.  Some cases of
<br>
cancer are certainly from these things, but you assert that the majority
<br>
of cancers, in fact the steep rise in cases of cancers over the past few
<br>
decades is primarily attributed to these things, the presence of these
<br>
things helps to actually lower the overall incidences of cancer (when
<br>
present below certain thresholds).  This is NOT the case, as I have
<br>
elaborated on and argued, DIET is the primary cause of cancer.   What we
<br>
eat (natural plants with natural pesticides) and how much of it we eat.
