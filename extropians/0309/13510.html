</em><br>
<p>That seems illogical.  Automation without AI made certain forms of fairly 
<br>
manual repetitive tasks be uneconomical if done by humans.  Computation 
<br>
greatly increased the number of tasks that humans are not competitive in.  
<br>
Increasing AI in our automation may well eventually produce AI that is more 
<br>
intellectually capable than any human being.  At that time I would expect 
<br>
most tasks to be assigned to non human labor.   The only exclusions would be 
<br>
certain types of service jobs.   And there will be only so much demand for 
<br>
those, almost certainly not enough to employ everyone.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't see any difference between the coming automation and the process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automation that's been happening since the industrial revolution got

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and all those household domestics would be doing as they were replaced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; household
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automation...things seem to be just fine as a result of those enormous
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and we're all better off for it. If you asked the man on the street in 1900
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the millions of farm workers would be doing with themselves, I doubt
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>What is missing here is that the pace and extent of technological change and 
<br>
thus the range of automation is greatly increased.  So an analogy to the turn 
<br>
of the last century is not particularly appropriate.    We on this list most 
<br>
seem to believe that the day will come when humans are outcompeted by 
<br>
automation including AI on a very large range of tasks.   It stands to reason  
<br>
that the remaining set of tasks will not forever be sufficient to provide 
<br>
employment for all of them, even assuming perfect retraining.    
<br>
<p>Now it is certainly a very open question what, if anything, should be done in 
<br>
such an eventuality.    It is also an open question to what extent we are 
<br>
already experiencing this effect.
