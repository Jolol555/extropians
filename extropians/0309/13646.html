Thanks for the terrific input. One of these days I expect to be as well read
<br>
in these matters
<br>
as so many of you seem to be. I'm 32 and playing catch-up from the time I
<br>
wasted from age 14-28 where I did absolutely nothing but waste precious
<br>
time. I'd like some input on a couple of things you wrote in your last
<br>
message.
<br>
<p>&quot;If anything, it's those
<br>
with the least resources and most disrupted family arrangements who are
<br>
likely to have a larger brood.&quot;
<br>
<p>--This doesn't bode well for the future of humanity. Especially since there
<br>
is a tendency for the brood to feed back on itself and reproduce the same
<br>
type of environment in their own offsping. Fortunately, there is the
<br>
occasion where the offsring get out of that loop and try to make a more
<br>
positive life...much like my own life.
<br>
<p>Accumulating errors exceed the ability of
<br>
repair systems to proofread fix them, even (to a lesser extent) the sex
<br>
cells. But this analysis, as we have seen, assumes part of what needs to be
<br>
demonstrated - that older organisms automatically cease breeding reliably.
<br>
While that is contingently true of complex creatures, as we have just seen,
<br>
what we need to ask is: why it should be so
<br>
<p>Has this in fact been demonstrated? It would make sense.
<br>
It seems to me that nothing could be reproduced perfectly every time. It
<br>
would require perfection which I don;t think is natural. Nature only gives
<br>
us the lower boundaries of the possible. Perfection, not being necessary to
<br>
reproduction, does not exist. If errors did not occur that exceeded the
<br>
repair systems abilities to correct them, we wouldn't even be here.
<br>
So if you take uncorrectable errors as a natural part of life, it would only
<br>
make sense that older organisms fail to reproduce reliably over time.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why, after all, shouldn't the machinery of the body's maintenance systems
<br>
keep working at peak efficiency forever? The accepted answer is that there
<br>
are better strategic trade-offs for available energy and coding, trade-offs
<br>
that allow the old to wear out and die.&quot;
<br>
<p>The accepted answer may be close to correct, but I think it is much simpler.
<br>
Nature simply doesn't have a goal. Without a goal, perfection could not be
<br>
reached. Nature could produce the bird, but it couldn't produce the f-16.
<br>
(not that the f-16 is perfect and yes, it is far less efficient). It takes
<br>
intelligence to create something likened to perfection. If anything were
<br>
perfect, or close to it, it would simply stay the same. Cockroaches come to
<br>
mind here for some odd reason.
