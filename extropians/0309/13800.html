<p>If that worked, you could have done it for the first address
<br>
in the first place, and not bothered changing it.  But it
<br>
doesn't seem to work.  Spam harvesters are pretty smart
<br>
programs, I think.
<br>
<p>However, the real reason I'm reluctant to do stuff like this
<br>
is that my usual preference is not to spend more time to raise
<br>
a barrier than it would take someone else to lower it.  If I
<br>
do something to &quot;get ahead&quot;, and someone else counters it, so
<br>
that we're even again, we've both wasted that much time on
<br>
useless competition, as opposed to some other kind of
<br>
competition which might produce something valuable. :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or don't worry; if most people don't do it, the spam bots wont worry

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Actually, as I mentioned in the part you snipped, I no longer have
<br>
a spam problem.  It's solved, as far as I'm concerned, and if
<br>
everyone implements similar solutions, it will be mostly solved
<br>
for everyone.  The only way for the spammers to get around it,
<br>
as far as I can see, would be to make the spam something I really
<br>
want to see.
