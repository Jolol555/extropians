I find it interesting to be on both sides of this debate,
<br>
as a free-market anarchist.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Great, so who ever has bigger guns wins out.  And why do you call this

</em><br>
<p>Straw man.  He said he was for anarchy; your question implies a State
<br>
(the local warlord), in a way that suggests you think that is really
<br>
what he wants.
<br>
<p>Personally, I regard the State as nothing more than very successful
<br>
criminals.  Therefore, we don't have a perfectly peaceful anarchy as
<br>
long as there is anyone performing functions similar to the State
<br>
(murder, theft, kidnapping, etc).  Nevertheless, I am sure that it's
<br>
possible to get closer than we are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't exactly want to maintain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an arsenal, can I pay someone else to do it and ensure no one threatens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me with their aresenal?  Isnt that, in a way, what I am all ready doing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with my taxes?
</em><br>
<p>No, it isn't.  If it were, you wouldn't notice them unless they were
<br>
actively protecting you right now.  In fact, practically everything
<br>
you do is altered by the State.  Further, you'd be able to stop paying
<br>
in exchange for cessation of services.  If you did stop, however, you'd
<br>
risk being kidnapped, or murdered if you resisted kidnapping very
<br>
effectively.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; After all, if someone comes up to me with a gun, I call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those people I pay, and they are hear to drag off the gun toting nut 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep him, basically, from f-ing with me.
</em><br>
<p>Have you tried that? :)  In practice, what they do is exact revenge on
<br>
those who f-ed with you. Once in a while.  If they find them.  To make
<br>
it clearer that protection is not the goal, they make it difficult to
<br>
protect yourself, too.   Even if they successfully exact revenge upon
<br>
your attacker, however, it won't help *you*.
