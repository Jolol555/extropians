<em>&gt; &gt; Are you sure that's a small fraction of the cases?

<em>&gt; &gt; People always say that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that most theft is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actually completely successful. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
&lt;snipped excellent reasoning on why crime doesn't pay in the long run&gt;
<br>
<p>That said, I think you still must explain organised crime bodies, especially
<br>
long standing ones. I think there you get criminals who can become
<br>
extremely, persistently wealthy. They most likely include the more
<br>
intelligent members of the set of criminals, although probably contain a
<br>
goodly number of bozos too (like legitimate business). 
<br>
<p>I think there are probably strong psychological reasons for there to be
<br>
intelligent, uncaught criminals; I'd bet there are people of extreme talents
<br>
with a taste for risk, who are drawn to it. I wonder if they tend to either
<br>
be eventually caught, or drop out after a little while?
