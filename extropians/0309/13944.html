A friend of mine posted this on another forum...
<br>
<p>-------
<br>
<p>Today [11 Sep] Dr. Edward Teller died at 95. For those who don't know who he
<br>
was, he was the father of the H-bomb, one of the men instrumental in getting
<br>
Roosevelt to start the Manhatten project, director at LLNL, and one of the
<br>
brightest atomic physicists the world has known. He led a controversial
<br>
life; designed the H-bomb (fusion bomb), blamed for the downfall of
<br>
Oppenheimer, largely responsible for our lead in the cold war, and an
<br>
outspoken proponent of a missile defense system. He had been awarded the
<br>
Albert Einstein Award, the Enrico Fermi Award and the National Medal of
<br>
Science.
<br>
<p>His death marks the end of an era of great physicists like Einstein, Fermi,
<br>
Feynman, Bethe, Pauli, Dirac, Schroedinger, Lawrence, Landau, Gell-Man,
<br>
Bohr.
<br>
<p>On a personal note I knew Dr. Teller at various phases of my life and was
<br>
always impressed with him. When I was in High School I took a series of
<br>
classes from him in Livermore. At that time he was 85, almost blind, almost
<br>
deaf, but sharp as a tack. I was very surprised how approachable he was,
<br>
often staying for a good while afterwards to talk with students. He felt it
<br>
was imperative that the younger generations embrace science and he made it
<br>
his mission to get students interested in the field of physics. I remember
<br>
when I'd ask him questions after the classes he always seemed very
<br>
interested and would encourage more questions. Second to my father's
<br>
influence, Dr. Teller was probably the most influential person in my life
<br>
when it came to my interest in science.
<br>
Seven years later I was accepted into the Department of Applied Science at
<br>
UC Davis for my graduate program. I didn't find out until afterwards that it
<br>
was a department that Edward Teller started in the 60s and still interacted
<br>
with. He had found then that at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory many
<br>
scientists weren't really trained to work in a lab environment, so he
<br>
convinced the UC system to put a science department onsite at the lab.
<br>
Students would take classes in the UC building and participate in real
<br>
research at LLNL, producing scientists with the training and education to
<br>
start working productively at the lab as soon as they graduated (and
<br>
before). He served as the department director for a number of years and
<br>
since as director emiritus.
<br>
<p>Over the years I attended DAS, Dr. Teller came and had lunch with the
<br>
students on many occasions. He was very blind, almost deaf, and barely able
<br>
to walk, but like the decade prior he had the mind of a 20 year old. His
<br>
favorite topic in these get-togethers was to speak on the importance of
<br>
scientists to use their technology and knowledge responsibly. He was always
<br>
friendly and always interested in what projects the various students were
<br>
involved in at the Lab. He also always knew a good deal about whatever
<br>
program you were in, the history behind it and the current research being
<br>
done in the field. My last impression of him was that he was still the
<br>
friendly, interested, and approachable man he was 12 years earlier. He will
<br>
be missed.
