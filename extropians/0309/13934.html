It's because it's code for &quot;They won't do what I say any more.&quot;  When 
<br>
they were younger they would generally do as they were told, but when 
<br>
they hit the teen years they are genetically programmed to become more 
<br>
independant.  Only in a tech civilization they can't.  (And tech, here, 
<br>
includes camel harnesses...not just high tech, but tech in the &quot;more 
<br>
than they can learn+acquire in 10 years&quot; sense.
<br>
<p>So conflict occurs.  It's supposed to drive the kids out to form their 
<br>
own household.  But they can't do that any more.  And the parents are 
<br>
supposed to object.  So they do.  But it doesn't have to make any sense, 
<br>
because it has to be something that can be forgotten once they've moved 
<br>
out.
