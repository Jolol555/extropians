A very good post, Alex. I hoped that I stated something similar to the
<br>
system of axioms and the general concept of ethics you describe, somewhere
<br>
in the previous parts of the thread, but maybe not forcefully enough to
<br>
avoid the impression that I am trying to assert an objective system of
<br>
morals.
<br>
<p>By all means, I have only a bunch of suggestions about the effective means
<br>
of achieving goals, as well as a short list of goals which I hope that
<br>
others might find worthwhile, such as finding the social system giving the
<br>
average human the best chances at getting what he/she/it individually wants.

<em>&gt; Robbie and Rafal... you are slinging the term 'morality' back and
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; posted something on the Genomics Yahoogroup that has just become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant here...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ----------
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One of the problems plaguing the field of ethics is a pair of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contradictory assumptions at its very core:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Some things are right and some things are wrong, and we need to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the difference.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I propose that ethics should be redefined as...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;An ontology for clearly stating what your particular system of axioms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is, coming to logical conclusions/decisions based on these axioms, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communicating your axioms and your process of reasoning based on them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to others.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's an example of how this more honest and rigorous approach to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics would work:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bob is a Christian. Bob states his axioms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I hold the following beliefs to be axiomatic-- God exists, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bible expresses God's will. In places where the Bible is not clear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the literal interpretation is to favored.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bob then states his conclusions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Based on what is written in the Bible, killing humans is wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unborn fetuses are human, and therefore abortion is wrong.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jane is a secular humanist. Jane does not share Bob's axioms, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aknowledges that they are axioms and not directly subject to debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; She can do the following, though...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a) She can point out contradictions within Bob's chosen set of axioms,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forcing him to assign priorities to the various axioms he holds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; b) She can challenge the chain of reasoning leading from Bob's axioms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (the Bible expresses God's will) to Bob's conclusions (abortion is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; c) If the above approaches both fail, Jane and Bob can agree to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that in the event of c), this disagreement isn't always peaceful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately. As an extreme example, if Bob's axioms were to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicitly include the statement &quot;Blow up abortion clinics&quot; and Jane
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was an owner/employee/customer of an abortion clinic, then Bob and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jane will inevitably find themselves in conflict at whatever level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permitted by the society they exist in and their level of commitment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to their respective axioms. But at least Bob, Jane, and any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bystanders would have a clear idea of what specifically the conflict
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was about... and whether or not the underlying issue has been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolved, voiding the conflict. For example, if safe and inexpensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removal/storage/transplantation of embryos became possible, Bob and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Jane would no longer have reason to quarrel-- after all, Bob never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated that &quot;Sex without intent to procreate is wrong&quot; and Jane never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated that &quot;fetuses must be killed&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead of this, ethics debates today seem to rely on appeal to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authority and some kind of imaginary universal concept of right and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong. It's FRAUDULENT to use value-implying terms without first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly identifying your values so your audience can make up their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own minds as to whether your idea of &quot;right&quot;, &quot;good&quot;, &quot;natural&quot;, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;humane&quot; corresponds to their own. The approach I've outlined above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will help expose individuals who are trying to conceal their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agenda underneath some kind of blanket &quot;consensus&quot; or &quot;prevailing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social norms&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There should be something equivalent to Godwin's Law that gets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; triggered when someone talks about 'morality' without saying exactly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what that word signifies to them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS: The original purpose of this thread was to figure out how not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the crack-pot treatment from fellow scientists at a vulnerable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early point in our careers. But what the heck, ethics is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interesting and important topic too.
