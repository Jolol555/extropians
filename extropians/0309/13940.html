<p>It's obviously FALSE that LLC's have arisen without resort to 
<br>
legislation.  LLC's have different legal dispositions in different 
<br>
states and their ability to deflect legal responsibility from their 
<br>
owners differs from state-to-state to.  The law is very specific about 
<br>
what kinds of things and LLC can and can not do.
<br>
<p>It's likely false that they COULD.  It's possible that you could write 
<br>
a contract (without the backing of a government) that would &quot;in theory&quot; 
<br>
limit your liability, it wouldn't ACTUALLY limit your liability because 
<br>
without the government to INSIST that your liability is limited, the 
<br>
victims of the companies &quot;ERRORS&quot; would come after you with pitchforks 
<br>
(assuming they could find out who you were and what you'd done &quot;by 
<br>
proxy&quot;).
<br>
<p>Best,
