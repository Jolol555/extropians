</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I think you missed a small but important point: while
<br>
it is true that all of this is *legally* happening
<br>
under the human proxy's name, that is but a legal
<br>
fiction.  In truth, the proxy need not be aware of
<br>
the fine details of what actions the AI can directly
<br>
take, for example issuing buy and sell orders through
<br>
an online daytrading account.  There are times when
<br>
the proxy's active assistance will be necessary, but
<br>
the AI could minimize those if gaining the proxy's
<br>
cooperation would prove difficult, for instance if
<br>
the proxy's and the AI's goals diverge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The first AI would have to buy the stocks through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proxy.
</em><br>
<p>Or through an account the proxy sets up.  Once the
<br>
proxy has signed the right forms, relying solely on
<br>
electronic communication - perhaps spoofable, perhaps
<br>
signed with a key the proxy shares with the AI -
<br>
might well be the expected method of operation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The wealth and power go back not to the AI
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (and non person under law) but to its human proxy.
</em><br>
<p>This is true from a legal point of view.  But again,
<br>
so long as the money and stocks remain in accounts
<br>
the AI has access to, the AI can manipulate these in
<br>
the proxy's name.
<br>
<p>Of course, the proxy can, at any time during this
<br>
phase, shut down the AI's access.  This is one of the
<br>
critical weaknesses of the AI, and avoiding it might
<br>
therefore well be the main goal of any interaction
<br>
the AI has with the proxy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But how would the rest of the world react. AI's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proxy Joe is getting super rich wiping out his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and outcompeting everyone with a rate of change that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't match. This looks to the losers like an arms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; race or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; marketing war against Joe who is using the AI as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tool.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, and likely given human nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Politically it is very hard to see people standing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and not attacking Joe or trying to counter Joe and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pervieved &quot;tool&quot; AI.
</em><br>
<p>It is likely this would happen.  It has happened in
<br>
the past to people who got rich using tools they
<br>
manipulated far more effectively (at least, to the
<br>
end of getting rich) than other people.  I submit
<br>
Bill Gates as a recent example - and he still has his
<br>
fortune at this time.  (Argue back and forth as to
<br>
whether he deserves it, the effectiveness of
<br>
Microsoft towards other goals, et cetera and so
<br>
forth.  The fact remains: he's rich, and it's
<br>
unlikely he'll be non-rich any time soon.)  It seems
<br>
likely that history would repeat itself, as it has
<br>
before.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A bit more capital would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; allow it to become the sole stockholder in at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some of these cases, streamlining the process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not it Joe, it proxy. It can't own shares its not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.
</em><br>
<p>It/Joe, but if the company only interacts with Joe
<br>
via email and telephone (thus, actually interacting
<br>
with the AI) and comes to think of Joe as an
<br>
eccentric billionaire (which might not be far from
<br>
the truth at this point), what difference does it
<br>
make?
<br>
<p>Or consider what happens if the AI has a very
<br>
lifelike robot replica of Joe constructed, designed
<br>
to fool biometrics, and then disposes of Joe's body.
<br>
(Kill, perhaps.  Perhaps just encourage to move far
<br>
away from society such that no one else ever sees him
<br>
again.  Same difference, mostly, though the two
<br>
scenarios have slightly different risks.)  There is
<br>
then no longer any difference between Joe's goals, as
<br>
perceived by the rest of the world, and the AI's
<br>
goals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yeah but what about the people that see the AI using
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Joe as his buyer (and Joe is really getting rich and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powerful btw and Joe is not designed to be friendly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in all folks terms). My point is Joe and his AI are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to face a strong political backlash. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Aren't they? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But money tends to be able to buy political
<br>
influence, or at least gain political influence from
<br>
those hoping to tap into the wealth.
