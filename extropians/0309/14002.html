I know it is probably unwise for me to post this.  But it may
<br>
be useful for people in the U.S. as well as foreign observers
<br>
of U.S. politics to understand one aspect of the U.S. political
<br>
arena.
<br>
<p>Why is this important?  Because the politics are driving decisions
<br>
that may seriously impact the funds available in the future for
<br>
everything from the National Nanotechnology Initiative to DARPA
<br>
funding of AI research to biotech and health related research.

The Tax-Cut Con
<br>
By PAUL KRUGMAN
<br>
<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/magazine/14TAXES.html?pagewanted=print">http://www.nytimes.com/2003/09/14/magazine/14TAXES.html?pagewanted=print</a>
<br>
<p>It is long, but perhaps one can sit down, read it and think about
<br>
some points it makes and some potential consequences.
<br>
<p>Mind you, I am not as opposed to deficit funding as I once was --
<br>
but I want to see clear evidence that the funds will primarily
<br>
be being used to accelerate technology development that will bail
<br>
us out.  I'm not sure that I see that at this time.
<br>
<p>Interestingly, if one looks at the U.S. &quot;war on terrorism&quot; as well
<br>
as the Columbia disaster -- both appear to be costing out at a rate
<br>
slightly in excess of $50 million per human life lost.  It would be
<br>
interesting to compare that with &quot;standard&quot; values of human life
<br>
that courts use for wrongful death suits which I would guess are
<br>
typically an order of magnitude less.
