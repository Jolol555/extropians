<p>
I laughed at the story about the thief who stole a GPS tracking device:
<br>
<a href="http://www.adn.com/24hour/weird/story/985993p-6924904c.html">http://www.adn.com/24hour/weird/story/985993p-6924904c.html</a>
<br>
<p>but then I started thinking about it.
<br>
<p>Expensive cars are now protected by GPS locator systems. These and
<br>
similar devices have a transmitter that will call for help if they are
<br>
stolen and they are becoming cheaper and more widespread.
<br>
Computers can have security systems that 'phone home' as soon as they
<br>
connect to the internet, so stolen computers can turn themselves in.
<br>
<p>CNET had an article about RFID tags that can be fitted to everything.
<br>
CNET was worried about the 'Big Brother' tracking implications because
<br>
every time you walked past a scanner your clothes, possessions, etc.
<br>
would report your presence to the authorities.
<br>
<a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1069-980325.html">http://news.com.com/2010-1069-980325.html</a>
<br>
<p>The Register says that manufacturers want to change all barcodes into 
<br>
RFID tags:
<br>
<a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/31461.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/31461.html</a>
<br>
And the European Central Bank is even considering putting RFID tags into 
<br>
paper money!
<br>
<p>But if everything can be 'tagged' then surely this means that theft
<br>
becomes impossible? It would need a central database to record changes
<br>
of ownership of course, with the previous owner required to authorize
<br>
the transfer. But if the authorities want to do suspect tracking then they will 
<br>
need to build the central database anyway.
<br>
<p>Police would just need to visit your home and the scanner computer would
<br>
list everything on the premises that was not registered to you. In
<br>
future they might be able to do this without even physically entering
<br>
the premises.
<br>
<p>So we can look forward to a near future without casual theft, burglary,
<br>
mugging, car theft, etc.
<br>
<p>That should help to empty the prisons as well.
<br>
<p>Oh joyous day!
<br>
