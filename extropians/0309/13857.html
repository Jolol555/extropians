</em><br>
<p>Well here's one would-be Bayesian who is ready to get the 
<br>
&quot;evil trick&quot; explained.
<br>
<p>I *loved* probability at secondary school as it seemed so
<br>
eminently useful and Bayes creates the same impression but
<br>
I find that I am frustrated by it in the same way. 
<br>
<p>Whilst I had a good intuitive handle on probability I had a 
<br>
lot of trouble translating English language logic into the 
<br>
mathematical formalisms that facilitate easier handling.
<br>
It was like putting the terms into mathematically formal
<br>
language was a language translation that I couldn't easily
<br>
do.
<br>
<p>Intuitively I can see that at round two there are nine chips
<br>
total and either 3 or 4 of those 9 are white. Because of the
<br>
rules that mean an early white increases the number of whites
<br>
latter I can see that at the point when their are 11 chips in
<br>
round 4, the fact of a white in round 2 would mean more
<br>
of the 11 were likely to be white AND vice versa. I.e.. Given
<br>
a white IS chosen from the 11 the chips in round 4, this 
<br>
probability tells us something about the likelihood that a white
<br>
was drawn in round 2 (it is higher than an even chance) but
<br>
that's where the wheels come off for me. I can't yet put these
<br>
facts into formal mathematical language (at least I think that's
<br>
my problem). I have the same problem with the formal rules
<br>
in Godel, Esher and Bach. Taking English language logic to
<br>
mathematical formalism and getting the benefits of being able
<br>
to manipulate the symbols is where I struggle.
<br>
<p>I did take a look at your excruciatingly gentle introduction
<br>
to Bayes, (I liked it. It helped, and is worth a closer look)
<br>
but for now I' m ready to see the evil trick when you are
<br>
ready to reveal it  ;-)
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
