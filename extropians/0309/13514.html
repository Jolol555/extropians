<p>I think there are two aspects to this (a) emotional reactions; and (b)
<br>
experiences with a high emotional content.  Basic survival mechanisms
<br>
would seem to place an emphasis on both -- you have to be able to respond
<br>
quickly (with emotion) under some circumstances; and you have to be able
<br>
to balance emotional experiences which may have conflicting indications
<br>
with respect to the promotion of survival.  Dealing with (a) has to do
<br>
with how one manages debate -- (one can contrast the &quot;style&quot; of the
<br>
British parliment with the U.S. Senate for example).  Dealing with (b)
<br>
has to wrestle with how one legitimately &quot;balances&quot; the significance
<br>
of various personal (self and other) experiences.
<br>
<p>I think (a) we may be able to refine while (b) may be much more difficult
<br>
to deal with -- I think this goes to the heart of why Greg said that
<br>
it seemed pointless to engage in political debates -- they are rooted
<br>
in personal experiences and you cannot simply wave a magic wand and
<br>
make those &quot;disappear&quot;.
