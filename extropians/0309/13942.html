<em>&gt;-----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From:  Robbie Lindauer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Incorrect, merely existing longer makes you more likely to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;get cancer, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; regardless of pollutants or carcinogens or ionizing radiation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;That would be assuming things like &quot;breathing air&quot; or &quot;existing under 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the sun&quot; doesn't cause cancer.
</em><br>
<p>Its called entropy.  Even if anti-oxidants destroyed every unbound
<br>
electron pair in free radicals, even if all ionizing radiation is
<br>
shielded, even if were are examing cells in a controlled petri dish in a
<br>
perfect environment.  Some of those cells will eventually become
<br>
cancerous.  This is because the cellular copying mechanisms are not
<br>
perfect, and cancers are just cells with different genetic structures.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The rest of your point I've already made.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As for whether or not plants cause cancer - maybe they do, but that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wouldn't explain why it's a greater killer now than 200 years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ago.  For 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that you'd have to add in the social factors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Look, no offense, but I don't think you know anything about cancer.  I
<br>
am no world renowned oncology expert, but cancer has been a subject of
<br>
interest for me.  Plants did not cause cause because for the last
<br>
900,000 years people DIED before enough mutations built up to cause a
<br>
cell to reproduce, undifferentiated, as quickly as possible, which is
<br>
what cancer is.  It takes *at least* five mutations for a cell to become
<br>
cancerous, 50% of cancerous cells have a mutation in the p53 gene, if
<br>
one of your parents gamete cells has that mutation, you are far more
<br>
likely to get cancer throughout your lifetime then people without that
<br>
mutation.  Its not just any five mutations, but a whole score of
<br>
mutations can occur in different places in the genome.  But only some of
<br>
those places of your genome, when changed, will make a cell cancerous.
<br>
At least five of the target areas have to be mutation.  Mutations can
<br>
come from a variety of sources, free radicals, ionizing radiation,
<br>
toxins, etc. etc.  But there must be at least five.  Any particular cell
<br>
has a particular chance of getting a mutation throughout its life.  The
<br>
longer a cell lives, the more mutations it gets.  When that cell
<br>
replicates, its child cells inherient its mutations.  Just as a child
<br>
whose parents have one of the critical mutations has now every cell in
<br>
his body with that mutation, all child cells of a mutated parent cells
<br>
in any being also inherient all mutations.  Eventually, all cells in
<br>
your body (with the exception of nuerons) are child cells of parents,
<br>
and more and more cells in your body get more and more mutations as you
<br>
exist longer and longer.  This is why age is so directly tied to
<br>
increase in cancer cases.  IF a child is born with four of the five
<br>
required mutations *in every cell of his body* he will probably get
<br>
cancer at a very young age, since only one cell in his entire body needs
<br>
to have the correct area of his genome mutated.  
<br>
<p>In short, it does explain it, you just don't understand it.  I suggest
<br>
you refrain from making assertive comments of areas where you do not
<br>
have sufficient background knowledge to be that assertive.
