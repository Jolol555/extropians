<p>Not true, there are negative aspects -- consider HIV, West Nile Virus,
<br>
SARS, etc. that can have significant negative impacts.  And then there
<br>
are things like Moore's Law, gradual advancements in birth control
<br>
technologies, declining economic costs (everything from cell phones
<br>
to food, in part due to biotech) and then eventually an evolution from
<br>
expert systems to AIs and nanotechnology that will have significant
<br>
positive impacts.
<br>
<p>Its going to be tough to be sure -- but not impossible.
<br>
<p>Look at my quote page:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Impossible is a word that humans use far too often.&quot; -- 7 of 9
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Accumulating errors exceed the ability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repair systems to proofread fix them, even (to a lesser extent) the sex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cells.
</em><br>
<p>Yep, even though there are over 130 genes involved in DNA repair it
<br>
doesn't come close to what a typical Error Correcting Code can do
<br>
on a disk drive.  And we know from Information Theory that we could
<br>
make this as reliable as we need to make it provided we have sufficient
<br>
information storage capacity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this analysis, as we have seen, assumes part of what needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrated - that older organisms automatically cease breeding reliably.
</em><br>
<p>Its interesting that the processes are different (at least in mammals) --
<br>
in females its due to the gradual loss of the eggs she is born with --
<br>
in males it is likely to be due to the accumululation of mutations in
<br>
the sperm due to the continual cycles of cell replication that
<br>
sperm production requires.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While that is contingently true of complex creatures, as we have just seen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we need to ask is: why it should be so
</em><br>
<p>Luck of the draw -- Nature hit on a system to mix up the genes perhaps
<br>
hundreds of millions of years ago and has just been executing variations
<br>
on a theme.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Has this in fact been demonstrated? It would make sense.
</em><br>
<p>Women go through menopause because they run out of eggs.  Men contribute
<br>
to an increased genetic disease rate as they age.  I also pointed out
<br>
several years ago on the list that something 70-80% of conceptions in
<br>
humans fail to produce a viable individual.  The error rates are fairly
<br>
high and there seem to be systems that detect that and prevent the birth
<br>
of more people with genetic defects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that nothing could be reproduced perfectly every time.
</em><br>
<p>Information theory says that if you are willing to have enough redundancy
<br>
you can reproduce perfectly (within constraints of the information storage
<br>
capacity at your disposal).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would require perfection which I don;t think is natural.
</em><br>
<p>Tell that to Deinococcus radiodurans -- the bacteria that can withstand
<br>
a megarad of chromosome breaking radiation that would kill human cells
<br>
many times over.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perfection, not being necessary to reproduction, does not exist.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but to Nature &quot;perfection&quot; is both mutation and selection.
<br>
If one didn't have both one wouldn't get variations on a theme
<br>
that produce better adapted organisms.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if you take uncorrectable errors as a natural part of life, it would only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make sense that older organisms fail to reproduce reliably over time.
</em><br>
<p>Aubrey, Rafal and I have discussed this at various times -- sometimes onlist --
<br>
sometimes off.  It looks like there may be variable control of mutation rates
<br>
with perhaps germ cells &lt;&lt; stem cells &lt;&lt; differentiated cells.  This has not
<br>
been proven to my knowledge.  It may be related to the activity levels of the
<br>
cells.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Why, after all, shouldn't the machinery of the body's maintenance systems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep working at peak efficiency forever? The accepted answer is that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are better strategic trade-offs for available energy and coding, trade-offs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that allow the old to wear out and die.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This is perhaps true -- it may explain the whole phenomena of caloric
<br>
restriction and lifespan extension.  The bottom line from my observations
<br>
is that it is very hard to get a &quot;perfect&quot; repair system.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The accepted answer may be close to correct, but I think it is much simpler.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nature simply doesn't have a goal.  [snip]
</em><br>
<p>Not true -- the goal is to evolve organisms that are better able to survive
<br>
and adapt to changing environments.  To do that without 'intelligent design'
<br>
one has to accept some flaws and negative consequences in the process.
