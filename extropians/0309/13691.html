<em>&gt; I can see Creighton and Kass potentially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making notes and rubbing hands with glee if we provide them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with two many details of what the right (wrong?) 10 might do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in future when lives are longer.
</em><br>
<p>Let me preface this with:
<br>
<p>I am BY NO MEANS ADVOCATING THAT ANYONE DO THIS.  PLEASE &lt; PLEASE&gt; 
<br>
DON'T DO THIS.
<br>
<p>I'm not afraid of Creighton &amp; Kass.  Maybe if I give them the hints 
<br>
they won't kill me?  I also don't think our lives would have to be 
<br>
longer...
<br>
<p>Anyway, here's the Brute Force, unimaginative version:
<br>
<p>2 Nuclear Physicists
<br>
2 Really Pretty Negotiators
<br>
1 Engineer
<br>
1 Mechanic
<br>
1 Fundraiser (slash thief)
<br>
3 Scott-Free Traveler/Spy/Thieves with some killer martial arts skills 
<br>
(I threw that one in for fun)
<br>
<p>How to gain the absolute loyalty of the team would depend on how 
<br>
desperate the group was and/or how ideologically committed they were.  
<br>
I expect they'd have to believe somehow that they were destined to win, 
<br>
should win, and that the evil current controllers of the world deserved 
<br>
their fate.  A quasi-religious cult might do.  They'd probably also 
<br>
have to be &quot;syndicalists&quot; - no single person would have control.
<br>
<p>What they would do:
<br>
<p>1) Raise/Steal $20-$30 million with options for more.  Perhaps under 
<br>
the guise of the Extropian Foundation or something :0
<br>
<p>2) Build a relatively small series of &quot;almost&quot; nuclear weapons - maybe 
<br>
20 or so - machines which when fueled properly would be nuclear.
<br>
<p>3) Go steal some nuclear material  ( I didn't say it'd be easy, just 
<br>
that the RIGHT people could do it).
<br>
<p>4) Distribute the nuclear material and machines to relatively hard to 
<br>
find locations in suburbs of major cities.
<br>
<p>5) Begin wholesale mass-production of nuclear weapons (you'll need them 
<br>
later!!!)
<br>
<p>6) Activate the existing &quot;strategically placed&quot; ones, make sure to have 
<br>
a good remote control system!.
<br>
<p>7) Announce from a &quot;hard-to-get-to-quickly&quot; position that you're ready 
<br>
to take over the world.  Begin negotiations - one set of useless ones, 
<br>
one set of useful ones.  Be able to quickly move people into the useful 
<br>
and non-useful slots.  Concentrate on making allies of enemies of 
<br>
currently powerful states.  (Oil countries, east-asian countries, 
<br>
african countries, south-american countries).
<br>
<p>8) Demand the surrender of several nations simultaneously (the 
<br>
superpowers - including the United States, Russia, China, Japan, 
<br>
France, England, Australia).
<br>
<p>9)  Call for people's revolutions, vow that anyone who joins you will 
<br>
be allowed to live.  Also start recruiting in earnest.  Give less power 
<br>
to the new recruits - let them work with a promise of material reward, 
<br>
but NO military power.
<br>
<p>10) When the first one balks, blow something BIG up, like Sydney or 
<br>
Chicago (please, not Los Angeles).
<br>
<p>12) When they balk again, blow up London.
<br>
<p>13) See how long it take before (some) capitulate.
<br>
<p>14) They may not, if not, there's a war on (assuming you followed the 
<br>
directions).
<br>
<p>15) The gambit will be whether or not the rest of the nations will be 
<br>
willing to risk war(s) on multiple fronts (while the strong get weaker, 
<br>
the weaker get hungry) or to capitulate.
<br>
<p><p>Lots of issue, but here are the first few off the top of my head:
<br>
<p>how to protect YOURSELVES - - everyone gets access to the remote 
<br>
control network, everyone is stationed in a different part of the globe 
<br>
- unless they get Mossad involved, you'll probably be fine (note to 
<br>
potentials, don't try to take over Israel this way until AFTER you've 
<br>
gotten to the US).
<br>
<p>how to maintain loyalty and commitment  - it's a 5-10 years project, 
<br>
people lose interest... - perhaps engender a party-atmosphere with the 
<br>
cohorts, listen to a lot of Prince music, etc.
<br>
<p>how to maintain moral detachment - probably some kind of Trotskyism 
<br>
would do.
<br>
<p>Finally - I am BY NO MEANS ADVOCATING THAT ANYONE DO THIS.  PLEASE &lt; 
<br>
PLEASE&gt; DON'T DO THIS.
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Robbie
