<p>### Yes, georgism has a lot to offer. Still, I have the feeling it doesn't
<br>
hit the mark. Consider e.g. rental property. In many situations, such
<br>
property is bought and sold relatively frequently, depending on the
<br>
availability of other investments. The rent collected by the owner is quite
<br>
limited, usually not appreciably greater than the gains from the stock
<br>
market, in most cases lower. Some long-term owners of real estate which
<br>
appreciated in value due to societal change may collect high rents, in
<br>
relation to the initial investment, but then such long-term investments are
<br>
risky, there were uncounted numbers of people who bought land which didn't
<br>
appreciate as much, and there is also the missed opportunity cost - one
<br>
could have invested in Berkshire-Hathaway instead  of land in Alaska. In
<br>
fact, since true productivity comes from manufacturing and services, most
<br>
importantly production of scientific discoveries, investors in these
<br>
activities gained most, while investors in land are like collectors of
<br>
moonlight - they get the second-hand effects of real enrichment.
<br>
<p>I think that George correctly identified rent-seeking as one of the
<br>
activities which can be taxed with the least damage to the economy, but
<br>
rent-seeking should be identified not so much with land-ownership per se, as
<br>
with monopoly or oligopoly control of limited resources, including, but not
<br>
limited to, land. Vast landholdings in some countries, especially where
<br>
agriculture is the pillar of the economy, indeed might limit growth, but the
<br>
same could be said, perhaps to a lesser degree, about some industrial
<br>
concentrations of power, such as the Societe Generale of Belgium, and other
<br>
industrial organizations with close ties to state power.
<br>
<p>It makes more sense, IMO, to tax (assuming taxation is desirable in the
<br>
first place) entities according to size, perhaps adjusted for the percentage
<br>
of market penetration in a sliding window of human mobility matrix (sorry
<br>
for the cryptic language in invented here, expl. follows). Human mobility
<br>
matrix would be a description of the ability of humans to change the
<br>
entities they interact with in a particular aspect of their life. Certain
<br>
interactions are highly constrained by location, like buying of sewage
<br>
removal services through the use of a sewer system. Competition in this
<br>
system is difficult to implement incrementally, and every service provider
<br>
might require an investment equal to the investments of the most successful
<br>
competitor. Other interactions, such as buying of groceries or dictation
<br>
transcription services, are less constrained by location, due to the ease of
<br>
transport of the goods and services, as well as the ability to have
<br>
competitors with lower total investment (lower barriers to entry). A window
<br>
of the mobility matrix covers a number of consumers (e.g. 5 000), multiplied
<br>
by the number of providers of a service. A small number of suppliers reduces
<br>
the number of the consumers in the window. If a supplier covers more than a
<br>
window of adjacent customers of constant size (the actual size would need to
<br>
be optimized in simulations and in practical experiments), a tax would be
<br>
assessed, depending on the percentage of customers the supplier has in the
<br>
window. So a sewer company would be taxed if it had more than 5 000
<br>
customers in an area where it is an exclusive provider, or 10 000 customers
<br>
if it has one competitor. There would be an incentive to either keep the
<br>
company small, or to build parallel sewage systems, so users could easily
<br>
switch, reaping both the benefits of competition directly, and the increased
<br>
reliability of double systems. Same reasoning applies to cable, land-line
<br>
telephone, etc. On the other hand, providing a radio station service to a
<br>
million people would still escape taxes - since there are dozens of
<br>
competitors supplying similar services. Land ownership would be taxed based
<br>
on a sliding window counting tenants. An additional level of adjustment
<br>
could be a factor of the total economic impact of the supplier/landlord in a
<br>
window - the percentage of total economic activity flowing through the
<br>
supplier (this would need more details than I have the time to describe
<br>
here).
<br>
<p>Please note that at no point do I suggest state provision of services, or
<br>
regulation of business practices, with the exception of size, which I treat
<br>
as a proxy measure of the ability to constrain individual choices of
<br>
consumers. The aim of the program is to increase economic growth by limiting
<br>
limits on competition, and provide funds for certain limited,
<br>
non-redistributive state services. Considerations of justice, fairness,
<br>
natural law and common decency do not apply.
<br>
<p>How abhorrent is this tax scheme?
<br>
