<p><em>&gt;  Certainly the Saudi teenagers would see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; TV and ask &quot;Why is it that the decadent and immoral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; west has so many cool things whereas we totally suck?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Could be that the Saudi thesaurus has pages devoted to 
<br>
decadent and immoral, but I wonder if they've a hit for &quot;totally suck&quot;?
<br>
<p><p>Anyone seen Mez of late?  Regards, Brett
<br>
<p><p><p><p>Friends, at the heart of it, this is surely why these
<br>
people are escalating world war 4: they can't seem to
<br>
*make* anything.  They seem incapable of generating
<br>
wealth, other than by selling their natural resources
<br>
for a song.  Selling oil doesn't actually create wealth,
<br>
it merely distributes it.  Microsloth, Apple, IBM and
<br>
Sun Microsystems create wealth.  
<br>
<p>Why do we have *nothing* in our homes made in Iraq?  
<br>
In Iran?  In any predominantly Muslim nation?  Why is it 
<br>
that they need to import foreign skill to get anything 
<br>
built?  Of course it leads to terrible culture wars; 
<br>
it gives them such a deep seated self-hatred that they 
<br>
treat their women as less than dogs.  They feel threatened 
<br>
by a freaking *doll* fer cryin out loud.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
Perhaps the answer to middle eastern conflict is to 
<br>
somehow inject a huge dose of unfettered capitalism.  
<br>
How?  spike
