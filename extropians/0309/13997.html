<p>That's probably a minor factor, given that our ancestors survived quite
<br>
happily without modern industrial chemicals in their environment for
<br>
millions of years.
<br>
<p>There is, however, a far more important cost tradeoff, which is polution vs
<br>
technology/progress. Removing the toxins is a good idea in isolation, but
<br>
remember that they are there for a reason; they are the result of someone
<br>
doing something. In many cases judgement should go toward removal of the
<br>
toxin (eg: dioxins?), but in other cases it is less clear. 
<br>
<p>For example, look at the growing problem of heavy metals (I think) leaking
<br>
out of old computers, and the resulting toxin levels in the environment
<br>
(ground water?). To have not made this mess, we very well probably would
<br>
have had to significantly slow down the computer revolution of the 80s and
<br>
90s, if not forego it altogether. Would it have been worth it?
<br>
<p>Many on this list ask an unfashionable question about the use of nuclear
<br>
power; namely, are the waste problems caused, and the the safety concerns,
<br>
bad enough to have warranted the backlash and subsequent avoidance of it?
<br>
What price did we pay for not having the cheap power that it could have been
<br>
providing us all these years?
<br>
<p>This, imo, is the big question about pollution. I'm no supporter of
<br>
pollution, by any means, but I don't think it's a dichotomy; theres a
<br>
multidimensional space of the various costs involved, and the evolving
<br>
solution is a constant dance between two much restriction and two much
<br>
environmental degradation/poisoning. 
<br>
<p>Also, as to removal of toxins being a good idea, all things being equal, I
<br>
think we can say that about a lot of things (exercise, diet, research money,
<br>
etc). Finite resources/effort will be applied to all these things in the
<br>
end. For what it's worth, I think the settings are probably wrong in some
<br>
areas (research dollars, for instance). Removal of toxins may be underfunded
<br>
too, I'm not sure.
