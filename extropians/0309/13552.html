<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Robbie Lindauer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Still waiting to hear from Mr. Burch in a civil manner what experiences
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back the use of the term &quot;Forced&quot; in relation to why the US went to war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Iraq as in &quot;The US was 'forced' to go to war with Iraq&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Robbie, unfortunately I've run out of time to write at length for the
<br>
holiday, so I'm going to try to express the super-condensed, enriched,
<br>
fortified version, rather than the fully-articulated, more-fully-explained
<br>
version.  Because of the form, I question the utility of the expression, but
<br>
with all due regard for trying to respond in a timely fashion, here goes:
<br>
<p>The action in Afghanistan was simple and straightforward.  The specific
<br>
agency that had mounted the 911 attacks had been and was continuing to use
<br>
Afghanistan as a base of operations in an alliance with the Taliban.
<br>
Failure to knock out Al Qaida's base in Afghanistan would have been a
<br>
failure to defend ourselves.  Knocking the Taliban out of power was an extra
<br>
added bonus (see below).
<br>
<p>The rationale for the war in Iraq is both more complex and broader.  Put
<br>
simply, I see states like Iraq as threats to values of liberty and progress
<br>
in the human condition.  I believe that the Saddam Hussein regime had
<br>
reneged on commitments it made in 1991 to end the first Gulf War and, by
<br>
doing so, had put itself into an outlaw position.  Complete consensus never
<br>
happens with progress in legal regimes: Almost always, some element of the
<br>
society in which a legal regime is growing steps ahead of the wave of
<br>
advancing consensus to act to establish new standards.  Ultimately law
<br>
either catches up with that action or rejects it.  For reasons that I cannot
<br>
articulate in the short time I have, I see the action in Iraq as having been
<br>
one of those &quot;boundary-pushing&quot; events.  Only time will tell whether this
<br>
will result in a new equilibrium of legal consensus being established.  Yes,
<br>
one can characterize this as promoting the U.S. as &quot;the world's policeman,&quot;
<br>
a view that is unpopular in the rest of the world.  Whether that is a view
<br>
that others will come to accept in the long run will be determined by the
<br>
long-term outcome of the action undertaken by the U.S.
<br>
<p>Finally, I see both the Afghanistan and Iraq wars, along with 911, in a
<br>
larger context of a real clash of cultures between Islam and those parts of
<br>
the world that have adopted Enlightenment values and have the courage to
<br>
stick by them.  Oil wealth and the West's dependence on Middle East oil have
<br>
empowered the Islamic world to take up again the expansionist program that
<br>
only temporarily ended with the growth in European strength in the 18th and
<br>
19th centuries.  Stopping that expansionism will be one of the challenges of
<br>
the 21st century.  Islam -- at least the Islam practiced in important parts
<br>
of the world -- has never put down the sword.  Much more violent clashes
<br>
between Islam and the Enlightened world are yet to come.
<br>
<p>With each paragraph above, I have stepped up one level of generalization
<br>
and, in doing so, have obscured significant meaning.  Sic transit...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would say that particular branch had taken a turn for the better,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't you?  We'd gotten quickly to the heart of the matter and were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even civil about it.
</em><br>
<p>Let us endeavor to maintain our civility.  Thank you.
<br>
