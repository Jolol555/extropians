</em><br>
<p>### As Alex noted in a recent post, it is useful to state what one means by
<br>
one's &quot;morality&quot;. I did it some time ago, and in the paragraph above I
<br>
provided an interpretation of your question within the ethical system I
<br>
espouse. Of course, since your moral system, and the whole Weltanschauung,
<br>
are different than mine, my system has no basis from your point of view.
<br>
However, as Alex writes, we can compare notes and try to point out internal
<br>
inconsistencies in each other's systems.
<br>
<p>Do it.
<br>
<p>Randall Randall made an excellent comment in this context, too.
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  A contract must be explicit to be enforced. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; ### Ashamed, perhaps. Blamed - well, it depends on the local customs
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; regarding the duties of guardians of prepersons. Such customs should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; be sufficiently simple and well-known to allow expectations to form,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and at the same time they should be subject (largely) to choice, by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; both parents and (to a lesser degree) their children, e.g. by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; expedient of polycentric law.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Directly contradicting your statement above.
</em><br>
<p>### I do not understand how the paragraph above contradicts my previous
<br>
statement. Tell me more.
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rafal - Contracts are pretty far down on the morality chain.
</em><br>
<p>### Maybe for you. In other words, if I was to ever consider buying
<br>
something from you, I would have to worry that you will default on the
<br>
contract, because, as you admit, you don't care about your word. Well, this
<br>
needs to be remembered.
<br>
<p>----------------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Similarly economic contracts tend to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; be backed by force and coercion either explicitly or implicitly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### See medieval merchant law. Ostracism is not coercion, but is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; effective at enforcing many contracts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ostracism is a form of coercion - &quot;Leave your house OR ELSE&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>### Maybe I used a term which could be interpreted as something else -
<br>
banishment. The sanction in merchant law is not banishment, it is avoidance,
<br>
expulsion from the community, but not expropriation. Also, merchant law is
<br>
first voluntarily accepted by its users, in contrast to king's law. It is
<br>
not coercion.
<br>
<p>-------------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you want to redefine coercion for your little moral system, go for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it, just don't expect anyone else to follow you down the road.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### This would not be coercion, unless you are talking about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; non-market, monopoly situations - such as a communist economy, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; statist plutocracy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Word games, entertaining to children, annoying to adults.
</em><br>
<p>### Now, you are saying I am infantile. Well, this makes an exchange of
<br>
arguments somewhat more difficult, doesn't it?
<br>
<p>Basically, you apply the word &quot;coercion&quot; to the outcomes of large numbers of
<br>
people making decisions without use of fraud or non-contractual use of
<br>
physical force (=the definition of the free market). In this way, the
<br>
previously rather precise term (coercion = the use of non-contractual
<br>
physical force against a person, or threat thereof) becomes rather vague, a
<br>
term of abuse, and an expression of dislike. You may dislike the free
<br>
decisions of other people, and define any influence you disagree with as
<br>
&quot;coercive&quot;, but redefinition of common terms only interferes with
<br>
discussions, and as I wrote, makes exchange of arguments more difficult.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### My statement goes &quot;Social goodness is whatever tends to get me
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and others most of what I and they want&quot;. For most well-informed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; low-emotional persons this will mean absolute (not relative)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; economic success under conditions of personal liberty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The project of defining morality by &quot;what most people want&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopeless and silly, you can see yourself going down that path here.
</em><br>
<p>### Ah, another put down. Poor little me.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Nah, most people want to gain. Whether it occurs at other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; people's expense, is a minor secondary consideration. In fact, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the exception of egalitarians, who see the gain of others as an
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; affront to themselves, and would prefer to even personally lose if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it's needed to ruin others, most people would rather gain *and*
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; profit others at the same time. It feels better, I can tell you that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Most People&quot; are smart enough to know that if you take someone else's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job, they lose it.  That's called gaining at someone else's expense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If they're ignorant of this rule, they were poorly brought up.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may ignorantly think that you can acquire billions and billions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollars without actually hurting anyone, but that just makes you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ignorant, certainly not moral.
</em><br>
<p>### You have a difficulty envisioning positive-sum interactions. Did Elvis
<br>
Presley hurt an inordinate number of people (ignorantly? :-), in the course
<br>
of earning his billion dollars?
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Most People&quot; don't agree about what they want - shoot, most people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; don't even know what they want themselves.  But just about EVERYBODY
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; can tell you whether or not you should torture children.  Good is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; much more concrete than this abstract &quot;what people want&quot; thing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Certain procedures are good at finding out what people want. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; includes the free market, demarchy, Borda count and a few other
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; tricks. These define good much better than whatever you or I could
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; elaborate on our own. Nothing abstract about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, we clearly don't agree on what most people want, do we agree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it's bad to torture children?
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, in most cases, the procedures I mentioned come up with an
<br>
enforceable injunction against the torture of children.
<br>
<p>BTW, since you think that the use of free market, and democracy to build a
<br>
morality based on getting people what they want is a silly and hopeless
<br>
project (as you wrote a couple of paragraphs back), do you have suggestions
<br>
for alternatives?
<br>
<p>------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Definitely.  On the part of a few very wealthy and powerful people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; who have had and continue to have extraordinary power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### This world is not made for and by elites. Masses of all kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; humans labored for centuries to build what we have, and AFAIK there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; are no Illuminati, effective conspiracies, and worldwide cabals.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I guess we differ here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; No Elders of Zion, either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stop being stupid.
</em><br>
<p>### Ah, but I can't! :-)
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is there a Queen of England?  A Bank of England?  A Barclays?  An FMR
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corporation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know anything about kabal/illuminati/etc.  I do know that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealthy use their power to keep their power and that has NEVER EVER
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CHANGED.  Has it?
</em><br>
<p>### They keep trying - but they are losing, century by century, decade by
<br>
decade. Today's advanced capitalist societies have a dramatically lower
<br>
level of power concentration and inequality (although some are plagued by a
<br>
proliferation of mass special interest groups opposed to long-term economic
<br>
growth, like labor unions, or the retired).
<br>
<p>The Queen of England has hardly anything to say outside her castles, poor
<br>
lady.
<br>
<p>Don't be so envious and angry at the rich. Relax. They are human, too. You
<br>
are not necessarily poorer because somebody gets rich. Positive-sum games do
<br>
exist.
<br>
