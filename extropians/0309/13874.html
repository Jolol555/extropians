</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I agree that limited liability should be abolished.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Why? Don't forget that tort liability (and this is the liability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking about) is a almost always a function of the state court 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its limitations/extensions are not a matter of physical law, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; malleable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convention, to a larger extent than e.g. contract law, which has a more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; direct recourse to game theory, and reciprocity-based moral intuitions.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I want to abolish the State itself as well, to be sure.  I would
<br>
say that it is illegitimate to remove liability in any sense by fiat,
<br>
rather than by contract with the affected individuals.  I'm not at all
<br>
sure that a privately produced legal system would have two different
<br>
kinds of &quot;crime&quot;, since these seem to map directly to &quot;crime against
<br>
an individual&quot; and &quot;crime against the State&quot;, except that lawmakers
<br>
consider murder to be more importantly a crime against the State than
<br>
against an individual, weirdly.  Therefore, when I suggest the
<br>
abolition of that entire class of crimes, I don't mean that every
<br>
crime in the class should be likewise abolished.
<br>
<p>If we remove this obfuscation of offenses, so that all offenses are
<br>
against an individual or group of individuals, it's clear that
<br>
removing liability without the express consent of those who would
<br>
otherwise be able to collect damages is simply legalization of
<br>
aggression.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see no reason why limited liability should be prohibited. This legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convention allowed some increases in investment, especially for poor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people.
</em><br>
<p>It isn't so much that it &quot;should be prohibited&quot; as that it has to be
<br>
specifically allowed, and you need a State (or universal agreement by
<br>
all actual and potential legal systems) to allow it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Tort liability in this context can be satisfied by liability insurance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carried by the LLC. The assessment of risk performed by professional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjusters for the insurance providers would determine the premiums, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly translate into increased stock prices of dangerous companies, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provides incentives for limiting liability exposure (by e.g. adopting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business practices).
</em><br>
<p>Instead of having a separate requirement for carrying insurance, why not
<br>
let the managers/owners of the business itself choose whether to carry
<br>
such insurance?  Removing some market feedback mechanism (liability for
<br>
one's actions, in this case) always seems to require one or more other
<br>
changes.  Each of these changes distort the market in other areas in
<br>
some (possibly small) way, which eventually look like &quot;market problems&quot;
<br>
to politicians, who then campaign to fix them with more patches.
<br>
<p>If, instead, you just use a rule of &quot;one is responsible for one's own
<br>
actions&quot;, and rigorously enforce it, then exceptions which arise will
<br>
be purely voluntary and can be contract-based.  Liability cannot be
<br>
limited by fiat, but it can be assumed by contract, which will often
<br>
have the effect you want, above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Without limited liability, stock owners would assume unlimited 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liability,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and only the professionals or the foolhardy can do that repeatedly.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alternatively, only stocks carrying sufficient liability insurance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; widely traded, but this would not differ from an LLC with insurance in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything but name.
</em><br>
<p>So other instruments that don't carry ownership would be created.  For
<br>
instance, you could have an instrument which was purely a debt-based
<br>
instrument, but which entitled the bearer to a share of the profits of
<br>
the enterprise, without any ownership of the enterprise.  This would
<br>
act the way you want stocks to act, without requiring a change in the
<br>
way the legal system works for the people involved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Abolishing LLC would change little in the economy, except for some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; names,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decreased reliance on stock for funding, increases in reliance on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; credit,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and maybe increased use of commercial insurance by businesses. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-professional investor would lose, and consumers would not gain.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that a statement that little would change in the economy
<br>
is equivalent to a statement that you can centrally plan this aspect of
<br>
the economy, and by extension, all aspects which it touches.  I'm very
<br>
skeptical of this kind of statement, since I'm unaware of any clear
<br>
examples of the success of economic central planning.
