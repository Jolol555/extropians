<em>&gt;&gt; Not so -- K-selection vs. R-selection will apply selection pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; particularly if the &quot;elders&quot; of a group contribute significantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to the survival of their children, grand-children, etc.  This seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; likely to be true in humans, elephants and whales -- though there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; is still a fair amount of academic debate on this topic.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Yes, I see your point here. I hadn't considered that. I keep forgetting that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;social&quot; aspect of our nature. Maybe because I'm reclusive. :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Still, I have to wonder what, if any, contribution &quot;elders&quot; would have that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;were significant enough to increase the likelihood of grand-children
</em><br>
<em>&gt;surviving to reproductive age in the early hunter-gatherer tribes of modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt;humans. 
</em><br>
<p>According to that splendid book THE LAST MORTAL GENERATION (which might be
<br>
out of date by now, four years later):
<br>
<p>========
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Die young, and leave a beautiful child
<br>
<p>Menopause - `the Change' - occurs, you'll recall, when pituitary hormones
<br>
fail to activate repair and maintenance systems further down the track. It
<br>
seems an absurdly early point in human life to shut down the reproductive
<br>
system, since menopause begins thirty-odd years before many modern women
<br>
are ready to die of old age. Surely the Darwinian dogma tells us that the
<br>
sterile lose their place in the evolutionary queue. However healthy they
<br>
happen to be, their success as phenotypes (or bodies) cannot win their
<br>
genes a place in the next generation. They might even find fertile mates,
<br>
but they have already lost the contest. There are well-known exceptions to
<br>
this harsh economics, mostly among insects where sterile workers are
<br>
selected because they share more than the usual proportion of genes with
<br>
their fertile sisters, and aid the hive's prosperity. Humans don't have
<br>
that advantage - except on a cultural level, where single celibates,
<br>
dedicated homosexuals and other `non-breeders' enrich the survival chances
<br>
of their child-bearing fellows. Is that the clue we need to explain
<br>
menopause's peculiarities? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recall that the endocrine cascade of menopause starts when the last of the
<br>
egg follicles in a woman's ovaries run out. This brute fact can be
<br>
interpreted in a several ways, some of them profoundly misleading. Without
<br>
eggs, it is sometimes said, a woman is no longer at the sharp end of the
<br>
natural selection process, so she can be discarded - left to die,
<br>
literally. This, as we'll see, is exactly what happens to other mammals
<br>
such as baboons and lions. A more accurate way of putting it is that, in
<br>
practice, bodies built from genes which managed to keep them healthy and
<br>
nimble until they were a thousand years old would have no reproductive
<br>
value over bodies that drop dead of heart attacks at 50 - if they cease
<br>
passing those genes on to descendants at 45. Evolution is a sieve for
<br>
groups of genes, not for bodies as such. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One trouble with that stark account, which seems sound as far as it goes,
<br>
is that it neglects the contribution of post- or non-reproductive family
<br>
members who share the same genes. Think of two imaginary human tribes, each
<br>
with several inter-marrying bands, who differ genetically in this respect.
<br>
In one, mothers simply die at about 50 or 55, seven years after giving
<br>
birth to their last child, conceived from one of their last eggs. The
<br>
moment the youngest child in the family is reasonably self-sufficient, the
<br>
mother (due to her characteristic blend of uncaring genes) gets cancer or
<br>
heart disease and dies. In the other tribe, mothers remain reasonably
<br>
healthy after an uncomfortable transition through menopause, and continue
<br>
as productive members of their community, providing food and, as custodians
<br>
of wisdom, hoarding and dispensing useful information that can make all the
<br>
difference between life and death to many of her grandchildren and nieces
<br>
and nephews for a couple more decades.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems intuitively obvious that the second evolutionary strategy will
<br>
prove more successful. Indeed, it is embodied in a recent anthropological
<br>
doctrine known as `the Grandmother hypothesis', advanced in 1997 by Kristen
<br>
Hawkes and James O'Connell, of the University of Utah, and Nicholas Blurton
<br>
Jones, of UCLA, based on research among the three hundred Hadza
<br>
hunter-gatherers in hill country near Lake Eyasi in northern Tanzania. The
<br>
healthy Hadza grandmothers foraged for food shared by their grandchildren,
<br>
which permitted their daughters to bear and suckle new babies rather than
<br>
expend energy and effort looking after their older children. It is true
<br>
that acting as wise elder repositories of knowledge (memes, in short) would
<br>
benefit the whole tribe indiscriminately. Hence, this benefit might not
<br>
have a direct and preferential effect on genetic reinforcement in the
<br>
blood-lineage along, and might not be selected for. Still, providing care
<br>
and food for their daughters' children certainly would benefit their own
<br>
gene line.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is an endearing notion, and useful in offsetting the bombastic stress
<br>
some male anthropologists have placed on the supposedly supreme virtue of
<br>
hunting as a source of food (not that this has been taken terribly
<br>
seriously for decades anyway). The problem with the grandmother theory,
<br>
alas, is that it just doesn't seem to make mathematical sense. And in
<br>
genetics, that is a very important hurdle. There's nothing abstract and
<br>
arbitrary about the mathematical models used to test population genetics.
<br>
The equations are clear and unforgiving, if used appropriately. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September, 1997, Natalie Angier reported in The New York Times that
<br>
`Using mathematical models, Alan Rogers of the University of Utah estimated
<br>
that a postmenopausal woman would have to double the number of children her
<br>
children bore, and eliminate infant mortality among those grandchildren, to
<br>
make menopause look like a sound strategy for propagating one's genes.'
<br>
That's an improbably improvement in life chances for any woman's
<br>
descendants, even a hardy Hadza's. I suspect, therefore, that in this raw
<br>
form, at least, the grandmother hypothesis has failed the test.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, George C. Williams' model of inclusive fitness might
<br>
yet save the day. I find it impossible to believe that the presence of at
<br>
least some wise elders would make little or no difference to the survival
<br>
prospects of a typical foraging tribe. Today, sadly, that's not really
<br>
true. It is surely nice for small urban children to have the loving
<br>
attention of their grannies, and convenient for hard-working parents to be
<br>
able to turn over some of the task of child-minding. But none of this
<br>
worthy contribution makes any difference, I think, to the number of
<br>
children who survive to maturity and pass along the family's genes.
<br>
Everything has got much more complex and confused with the coming of
<br>
contraception, abortion choice, smaller families. If anything, it's those
<br>
with the least resources and most disrupted family arrangements who are
<br>
likely to have a larger brood.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other species, the evidence is ambiguous. A 1998 article in Nature
<br>
by Craig Packer, a biologist at the University of Minnesota, St. Paul, Marc
<br>
Tatar of Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, and Antony Collins
<br>
of the Gombe Stream Research Centre in Kigoma, Tanzania, noted that:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reproductive cessation has also been documented in non-human primates,
<br>
rodents, whales, dogs, rabbits, elephants and domestic livestock. The human
<br>
menopause has been considered an evolutionary adaptation, assuming that
<br>
elderly women avoid the increasing complications of continued childbirth to
<br>
better nurture their current children and grandchildren. But an abrupt
<br>
reproductive decline might be only a non-adaptive by-product of
<br>
life-history patterns... a systematic test of these alternatives us[ed]
<br>
field data from two species in which grandmothers frequently engage in
<br>
kin-directed behaviour. Both species show abrupt age-specific changes in
<br>
reproductive performance that are characteristic of menopause. But elderly
<br>
females do not suffer increased mortality costs of reproduction, nor do
<br>
post-reproductive females enhance the fitness of grandchildren or older
<br>
children. Instead, reproductive cessation appears to result from senescence. 
<br>
<p>The animals studied were baboons and lions. The distinction in life span is
<br>
revealing. Female baboons who make it to old age become menopausal at 21,
<br>
and survive an extra five years - a couple of years longer than needed for
<br>
their last infant to outgrow dependency. Female lions live only 18 years,
<br>
with menopause at 14, and their cubs need about a year of maternal attention. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kristen Hawkes argues that this might not be as water-tight an argument
<br>
against the `Grandmother Hypothesis' as it seems, in evolutionary terms.
<br>
Four-fifths of hunter-gatherer women, these days at least, survive beyond
<br>
menopause, often into their seventies, so their contribution is marked.
<br>
Lions, though, average only an extra three and a half years, and baboons
<br>
only five. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tried and true
<br>
<p>The basic argument here is that an organism that has stopped bearing young
<br>
- or, in the elaborated version, can no longer contribute to the thriving
<br>
of grandchildren - loses its relevance in the genetic struggle for
<br>
survival. That is, we die after we have fallen too far behind in the
<br>
struggle for genetic endurance. Accumulating errors exceed the ability of
<br>
repair systems to proofread fix them, even (to a lesser extent) the sex
<br>
cells. But this analysis, as we have seen, assumes part of what needs to be
<br>
demonstrated - that older organisms automatically cease breeding reliably.
<br>
While that is contingently true of complex creatures, as we have just seen,
<br>
what we need to ask is: why it should be so? 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In other words, it is logically possible that an endlessly healthy,
<br>
self-repairing and fertile couple could run a production-line of their
<br>
joint genes until the end of time, with an inclusive fitness function (in
<br>
the jargon of the population geneticists) for their very own selfish genes
<br>
which is superior to that of their rivals' gene pool. Both Darwin and
<br>
Mendel would rub their hands with glee without a single censorious word of
<br>
reproof. The only reason our earlier imaginary tribes came to the same
<br>
grisly end was that the thousand-year-old women in the long-lived tribe
<br>
were assumed, rather arbitrarily, to become infertile at about 45. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why, after all, shouldn't the machinery of the body's maintenance systems
<br>
keep working at peak efficiency forever? The accepted answer is that there
<br>
are better strategic trade-offs for available energy and coding, trade-offs
<br>
that allow the old to wear out and die. One reason this happens is that the
<br>
world is a dangerous place. It's a lethal place, most of the time, in the
<br>
wild - and the wild is where most humans have spent their time, until very
<br>
recently indeed. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another reason is that its deadliness keeps changing lanes, as viruses,
<br>
bacteria and parasites frantically mutate. Sex happens to be a quite
<br>
effective method for generating novel immune defence codes, blending two
<br>
working systems into a fresh version, perhaps with some novel benefits.
<br>
That makes sex a kind of genetic-immunological luck dip, since many
<br>
combinations are just as likely to make the creature they specify worse off
<br>
- but evolution is a blind process, not a caring designer, and if one
<br>
strategy is more successful than another, it is preserved, at whatever the
<br>
cost to individuals.
