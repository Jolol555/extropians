Samantha:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Cute, but it has the standard Creator problem.  How was the Creator 
<br>
created?  
<br>
From what process did the original first SuperIntelligence spring?   Unless 
<br>
somehow the snake does indeed swallow its own tail, there must have been one 
<br>
universe that was not created by some SI.  
<br>
<p>- samantha&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Of course you are right on this issue. I purchased a book by Edward Harrison, 
<br>
a retired cosmologist from Amhurst or U. Mass. The original work was 
<br>
published in 1985. He viewed the universe as created by &quot;angels&quot; or as some of us 
<br>
might quip &quot;godz&quot; and I wonder if the author of this new book, Biocosm; was not 
<br>
also influenced by Andrei Linde, from Stanford? Harrison seemed to conclude that 
<br>
the universe was the mind. Perhaps looking at the universe in a different way 
<br>
then your typical astronomer, may help the species forward. This is my hope, 
<br>
anyways.
