<p>
Isn't Islam a good bit younger than Hinduism, Christianity and Buddhism?
<br>
Islam is like the teenager of world religions.  It took an awful long time
<br>
for Christianity to &quot;simmer down.&quot;  Perhaps, as religions mature, their
<br>
followers get a bit more laid back.  Now, obviously some Hindus and
<br>
Christians can still get rabble roused and incited to violence, but in
<br>
general their followers seem to be less raucous.  
<br>
<p>I think part of the problem is

<br>
<p><p>Ok, so Damien makes some reasonable counterpoints to my arguments
<br>
that other religious groups may be less violent than Islam.
<br>
(So my comments on who might be the most violent religious groups
<br>
may be open to significant debate.)
<br>
<p>But *what* then is driving these people to irrational behavior?
<br>
Is it simply &quot;salvation&quot; in the afterlife, e.g. really gone wrong
<br>
mental programming?  Social pressure?  Desire for power by the leaders?
<br>
It simply does not seem rational.
<br>
<p>It is not a trivial question as many of these groups will be
<br>
opposed to the entire extropian/transhumanistic agenda.
<br>
We are just lucky that we tend to be off of their radar at this time.
<br>
<p>R.
