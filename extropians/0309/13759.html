<p>As promised in CRN's initial response to the recent Greenpeace report on
<br>
nanotechnology, we have prepared a detailed technical analysis and
<br>
commentary on their report. For more information, The release is available

<p>(ETC Recent activity) Developing nations 'must wise up to nanotechnology'.
<br>
Decision makers in developing countries need more information about the
<br>
potential impact of nanotechnology on their economies and livelihoods. This
<br>
was the warning given to a conference in London yesterday that celebrated
<br>
the 30th anniversary of economist E.F. Schumacher's influential book Small
<br>
is Beautiful, which argued that inappropriate technologies were failing the
<br>
developing world. Pat Mooney, head of the Canada-based Action Group on
<br>
Erosion, Technology and Concentration (ETC) warned that emerging field of
<br>
nanotechnology - technology and engineering at the level of atoms and
<br>
molecules - could damage developing countries' export markets and
<br>
agricultural systems...But Mark Welland, a nanotechnologist from the
<br>
University of Cambridge, United Kingdom, urged against generating 'hype'
<br>
over the possible effects of nanotechnology, both positive and negative. &quot;We
<br>
have to be realistic and not expect too much,&quot; he said.  (SciDev 9/4/03)

<p>Drexler speaks! - Or at least writes! In this week's issue of the magazine,
<br>
I wrote a story about some of the hype over nanotechnology-particularly
<br>
estimates of how big of a market various nanoproducts might someday have.
<br>
But it's hard to talk about nanotech without mentioning the guy who invented
<br>
the term: Eric Drexler, author of the 1986 book Engines of Creation.
<br>
(Drexler and everyone else in the field credit the founding vision behind
<br>
nanotech to a 1959 talk by Caltech physicist Richard Feynman). In
<br>
researching my article, I had a fascinating E-mail chat with Drexler. Here
<br>
is some of that exchange:...

<p>The world's smallest buckets. In a typical chemistry lab, the smallest

containers hold just two millilitres of liquid. But despite their size,
<br>
these tiny glass tubes still contain billions of atoms. Now, there are &quot;nano
<br>
test tubes&quot; so small they hold just a few hundred atoms. Such containers,
<br>
with a diameter equivalent to about 20 atoms, have been manufactured by
<br>
experts at the University of Nottingham. (BBC News 9/5/03)

<p>Peres to deliver keynote Nanotech address at U.S. conference. When Shimon
<br>
Peres appears in Washington DC this week to deliver a crucial keynote
<br>
address, it will not be in any of his current roles as Labor party leader,
<br>
Nobel peace prize laureate, nor even as a highly-respected elder statesman
<br>
for Israel. Instead, Mr. Peres will be speaking in his newest role: that of
<br>
nanotechnologist. That role was taken on last spring with a speech given
<br>
before the Knesset, during which Peres unequivocally declared Israel's need
<br>
to be among those nations leading the development and commercialization of
<br>
this fundamental new technology. (Israel21 9/7/03)

<p>Nanomaterials. Large chemical and materials companies target small
<br>
nanotechnology firms for venture investing, collaborations, and product
<br>
innovations. Good things come in small packages. the unique properties of
<br>
nanomaterials and structures on the nanometer scale have sparked the
<br>
attention of materials developers. Incremental shifts in product performance
<br>
using these materials--for example, as fillers in plastics, as coatings on
<br>
surfaces, and as UV-protectants in cosmetics--are already occurring. The
<br>
technology holds more promise for the future, though, and is expected to
<br>
bring more disruptive changes to both products and markets. (C&amp;E cover story

<p>USC Receives $1.3M Nanoscience Grant. The National Science Foundation has
<br>
awarded the University of South Carolina a $1.3 million grant to research
<br>
the ethics of nanoscience, which is the study of atoms and molecules. The
<br>
four-year grant is a major step forward for the university's nanoscience
<br>
research, USC said. In June 2001, the university created its NanoCenter,
<br>
which brings together faculty from science, math and engineering to conduct
<br>
research. The university sees the efforts as gaining a better foothold in
<br>
emerging technology. (Macon 9/4/03)

<p>In the Laboratory for Electronic and Electromagnetic Systems at
<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), electrical engineer Markus Zahn
<br>
and his research team are exploring ferrofluids' potential in nanoscale
<br>
motors and biomedical devices. All the current uses of ferrofluids involve
<br>
their responding to permanent magnetic fields, fields that remain constant
<br>
and don't change over time. Zahn asked, &quot;What happens if you put a
<br>
ferrofluid in rotating magnetic fields?&quot; He knew that electromechanics
<br>
involved rotating machinery, and so he reasoned, &quot;Ferrofluids could make the
<br>
world's smallest and simplest rotating machines. A simple, single magnetic
<br>
particle in a rotating magnetic field will spin.&quot; Since ferrofluid involves
<br>
countless numbers of particles, &quot;you could induce lots of fluid motion that
<br>
could be used in nanoscale devices.&quot; -the movie on this webpage does not

<p>ASU Researchers Develop Method for Testing Molecular Electronics.
<br>
Researchers at Arizona State University have developed a relatively
<br>
straightforward method for measuring the electrical resistance of single
<br>
molecules. The advance is a technical achievement in terms of its precision
<br>
and repeatability. The researchers, Nongjian Tao, an ASU electrical
<br>
engineering professor, and his student Bingqian Xu, said their method
<br>
overcomes three thorny issues in the electrical resistance measurements of a
<br>
single molecule. &quot;What we have is a technique that guarantees one molecule
<br>
is attached between two electrodes every time; we can identify how many
<br>
molecules are present; and we can do thousands of measurements in a matter
<br>
of minutes,&quot; Tao said. (Nanotech Planet 9/2/03)

<p>Nanotubes Surprise Again: Ideal Photon Emission. Carbon nanotubes, recently
<br>
created cylinders of tightly bonded carbon atoms, have dazzled scientists
<br>
and engineers with their seemingly endless list of special abilities--from
<br>
incredible tensile strength to revolutionizing computer chips. In today's
<br>
issue of Science, two University of Rochester researchers add another feat
<br>
to the nanotubes' list: ideal photon emission. &quot;The emission bandwidth is as
<br>
narrow as you can get at room temperature,&quot; says Lukas Novotny, professor of
<br>
optics at Rochester and co-author of the study. Such a narrow and steady
<br>
emission can make such fields as quantum cryptography and single-molecule
<br>
sensors a practical reality.

<p>Wet nanoparticles alter their atoms. 'Just add water' is a phrase found on
<br>
many instant-mix food packets. Now scientists at the University of
<br>
California Berkeley, US, have found that applying the technique to certain
<br>
nanoparticles can actually change their structure. The researchers
<br>
synthesized zinc sulphide (ZnS) nanoparticles with an average diameter of 3
<br>
nm in anhydrous methanol. They discovered that adding water to the
<br>
nanoparticles at room temperature reduced distortions of the surface and
<br>
interior of the particle, producing a more crystalline arrangement of atoms.
<br>
The resulting structure was close to that of sphalerite - tetrahedrally
<br>
coordinated cubic ZnS. (nanotechweb 8/28/03)

Nanobiotech companies are developing miniaturized components that could
<br>
revolutionize medical implants, ophthalmic surgery tools, cell manipulators,

and nanofluidics, reports Genetic Engineering News (GEN;
<br>
www.genengnews.com ). Some firms are manufacturing nanotech systems for

homeland security and other applications in national defense, according to
<br>
two related articles in the September issue of GEN. &quot;Nanotech received a
<br>
huge boost with the introduction of the atomic force microscope in the late
<br>
1980s because this allowed scientists to take measurements at the atomic
<br>
level,&quot; says John Sterling, editor-in-chief of GEN.(Quote.com 9/5/03)

<p>Gold Speck Highlights Molecules. How do you sense what is happening at the
<br>
scale of molecules, which are thousands of times smaller than microscopic
<br>
objects like red blood cells? Researchers from Ludwig-Maximilians University
<br>
in Germany have found a way to detect the very small spectral shifts that
<br>
occur when the light scattering off a single gold nanoparticle interacts
<br>
with molecules. The device makes it possible to detect molecular changes in
<br>
real-time. The method could eventually be used to make arrays of devices
<br>
that very quickly sense many types of molecules at once. (Technology Review

<p>DNA Throttle Controls Molecular Machine. A DNA sequence that acts as a
<br>
throttle to control the rate at which an enzyme moves along the DNA has been
<br>
observed by researchers at UC Davis. By controlling the activity of the
<br>
RecBCD helicase enzyme, the &quot;Chi&quot; sequence can affect how efficiently genes
<br>
are repaired. RecBCD unwinds the DNA double helix so that the genetic code
<br>
can be read, copied or repaired. This unwinding is an essential first step
<br>
in most processes involving DNA. The research findings, which are published
<br>
in the September 5 issue of the journal Cell, could explain how short DNA
<br>
sequences such as Chi can interact with enzymes and affect how DNA is copied
<br>
or repaired. They could also give insight into how to control the speed of
<br>
tiny nanomachines built for various purposes. (ScienceDaily 9/5/03)
