<em>&gt; &gt;Mormonism is *much* younger than Islam but not at all violent. Many of

the
<br>

<p>Amara said

<p><em>&gt; I don't have an opinion regarding the 'age' of a religion, but I do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that religions evolve in time, and the violent aspects do check
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Christianity had its Reformation.. Islam has not had its own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'reformation' yet. Extremists at the edge of every religion will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always exist, but I think that Islam is ripe for an upheaval of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of its core elements. Some Moslem scholars have observed and written
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Islam needing a 'reformation', unfortunately their ideas have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not been accepted well in their societies yet.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One example of such a person is Nasr Hamid Abu Zeid. He is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Egyptian teacher, and was a professor of Arabic Literature at Cairo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; University, who has written some works that interpret the Koran in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the context of life at the time that the Koran was written. In his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book: _Criticism of Religious Discourse_, he writes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Since language develops with the development of society and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; culture, providing new ideas and developing its terminology to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; express more developed relations, then it is necessary and only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural to re-interpret texts in their original historical and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social context, replacing them with more contemporary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretations that are more humanistic and developed, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeping the content of the verses stable.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&lt;big snip about what has happened to this fellow&gt;
<br>
<p>I think we need to be very careful, both about metaphors that liken
<br>
religions to human individuals (use of words like 'adolescence') and about
<br>
historical comparisons. A Reformation is the last thing Islam needs right
<br>
now - fundamentalists are very similar in their rhetoric and analysis to
<br>
people such as Luther and Calvin. The Reformation did not make Christianity
<br>
more mellow or rational, on the contrary it reversed a movement towards
<br>
rationalism in the writings of people like Erasmus and made Christianity
<br>
(both Catholic and Protestant) much more dogmatic and intolerant. It also
<br>
led to savage religious wars within 'christendom' - I think something that
<br>
is actually the most probable outcome of Islamic fundamentalism. What Amara
<br>
is talking about and Abu Zeid is articulating here is more like the 'higher
<br>
criticism' of the mid-nineteenth century, which has destoyed the traditional
<br>
way of reading the Bible for most educated people. Textual criticism of the
<br>
Koran may sound boring but it's actually the way to go.
