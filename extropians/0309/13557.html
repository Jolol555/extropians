Greg:
<br>
<p>Thanks for your reply.  Let's stick to Iraq for now, talking about two 
<br>
wars at once is almost as hard for me as watching them.
<br>
<p>You allude to a few reasons for attacking Iraq that I will paraphrase 
<br>
here to make sure I've got a good understanding of what you're saying:
<br>
<p>1)  Iraq is a threat to the values of liberty and progress.
<br>
2)  Saddam Hussein's regime had reneged on commitments.
<br>
3)  It was time for a major social-upheaval in Iraq and we had to be 
<br>
the catalysts.
<br>
4)  Our &quot;Enlightenment-based&quot; culture is fundamentally in disagreement 
<br>
with Iraq's culture.
<br>
<p>___________________
<br>
<p>Going from our point of agreement, that nations shouldn't bomb other 
<br>
nations unless &quot;Forced&quot; to and your apparent contention that it was 
<br>
forced, we need to get some agreement on what is meant by &quot;forced&quot;:
<br>
<p>A nation is &quot;forced&quot; to do something if all other options would cause 
<br>
more pain, death and violence to their population than the one in 
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>I know that jumps through quite a few hoops - the concept of 
<br>
nationhood, the responsibility of the ruling class to its population, 
<br>
etc.  I'm also not taking into account the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; additions 
<br>
that there should be universal responsibility of people making the 
<br>
responsibility broader than just the population of the nation in 
<br>
question.  In any case, I think the above definition should be 
<br>
relatively uncontroversial.
<br>
<p>Regarding your reasons (1), (2), (3) and (4), it's pretty clear that 
<br>
the counterfactual:
<br>
<p>(5)		&quot;There were other things we could have done to promote those goals 
<br>
which would have been equally or more likely to cause less pain, harm 
<br>
and death to Americans.&quot;
<br>
<p>or the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; and quite stronger version:
<br>
<p>(5e)		&quot;There were other things we could have done to promote those 
<br>
goals which would have been equally or more likely to cause less pain, 
<br>
harm and death to Humans.&quot;
<br>
<p>Is true barring any a priori determinism which would obviate the whole 
<br>
moral question.  That's assuming for the moment that the goals outlined 
<br>
above are clear or worthy of pursuit about which I'm not sure.
<br>
<p>It wouldn't take a tremendous amount of imagination to review those 
<br>
alternate scenarios.  I believe that the French had a perfectly 
<br>
reasonable proposal before the UN to step-up the effectiveness of the 
<br>
(now apparently completely effective) UN inspection regime and the 
<br>
economic pressure that the US and its (at least prior to the war) 
<br>
Allies can put on a nation is tremendous (if we're interested in 
<br>
controlling the economic growth of another country which strikes me as 
<br>
an illegitimate goal - what we've found is that wealthy people are less 
<br>
inclined to go to war than the poverty-stricken).
<br>
<p>If you like it might be a worthy exercise in international diplomacy to 
<br>
take a few minutes to rehash those alternate scenarios, or we can just 
<br>
take that as a given.
<br>
<p>In any case, in light of (5) and (6), don't you think it's false that 
<br>
we were &quot;Forced&quot; to invade Iraq?  Or do you really think there was 
<br>
absolutely no other option?  If so, I'm interested in hearing more on 
<br>
why there really were genuinely no other options.  I admit, it sounds a 
<br>
bit complicated, but I sense we're at least making progress on 
<br>
identifying the source of our disagreements.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
