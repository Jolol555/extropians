<p>
So if I understood Randy right, some entire cultures should be managed 
<br>
by other cultures &quot;for their own good&quot; since they are not rational and 
<br>
wise, while Robert thinks people are not rational and wise since some 
<br>
people choose short-term goals. 
<br>
<p>Personally I think you are falling into exactly the trap Brin was
<br>
warning against. These views are not compatible with the libertarian
<br>
idea that people can be trusted and allowed to run their own lives. The
<br>
fact that some are not rational or long-term is not an indictment of
<br>
everybody else. And policies based on the &quot;people are irrational and 
<br>
stupid&quot; meme complex tend to be centralist, misanthropic and coercive.
<br>
<p>In Randy's case, the response is likely to have the rational cultures
<br>
manage the irrational ones. The only problem is of course how to tell
<br>
which ones are rational. The US government right now certainly thinks it
<br>
is rational, and right now cheerfully tries to implement it in the
<br>
&quot;irrational&quot; middle east. Meanshwile representatives of European culture
<br>
thinks they are even more rational and actually should manage the
<br>
irrational and dangerous US if they only had the power (and who knows
<br>
that the Chinese are thinking). Sounds like a recipe for disaster. Just 
<br>
imagine a situation where the power ranking was different.
<br>
<p>But I think Robert's case is more important (foreign policy isn't
<br>
exactly the area where Brin's analysis is relevant) since it directly
<br>
impringes on our transhumanist goals. 
<br>
<p>Isn't transhumanism a short-term (and hence irrational) strategy,
<br>
compared to the promise of eternal life given by our Lord and Saviour
<br>
Christ? That argument might not convince anybody on this list, but it
<br>
makes a lot of sense to a lot of people. So maybe for our own good we
<br>
should be sent to church. The rationalist response is of course to try
<br>
to demonstrate the irrationality of religious beliefs, which seldom has
<br>
any larger effect than polarizing the issue since religion often runs on
<br>
another epistemology than we do. It becomes a kind of shouting match,
<br>
and whoever wins and gets to decide who is and isn't irrational is
<br>
likely going to oppress the other. Which is exactly the situation
<br>
libertarianism was out to avoid by trying to set up frameworks of mutual
<br>
tolerance and ways of trading even when people disagree. 
<br>
<p>Today boxers know that boxing is unhealthy, and they still do it. Many 
<br>
athletes are apparently willing to sacrifice their lives in order to 
<br>
excel. Are they irrational (and hence in need of being managed for their 
<br>
own good)? I don't think so. I think they have a very different value 
<br>
system from us, one that evaluates fame and achievement enormously 
<br>
higher than long-term health, and then act accordingly. That might 
<br>
very well be the best life to live for them. There exist a lot of very 
<br>
strange life projects, and if we or anybody else would start dividing 
<br>
them into apporved &quot;rational and wise&quot; lives and disapproved 
<br>
&quot;irrational&quot; lives, we end up with the same problems as with the 
<br>
religion example above. In the end it all becomes an issue of power 
<br>
rather than human excellence. Transhumanism is not likely to be on the 
<br>
powerful side, and even if it was, how would we handle the vast 
<br>
differences in opinion on the most rational approach to posthumanity 
<br>
within our own group?
<br>
<p>Brin's point is important: it does not matter that we see a lot of 
<br>
people doing things we think are stupid. They have actually been doing 
<br>
great! By starting from the *positive* side of humans and their 
<br>
institution and looking at how it can be improved, you get a very 
<br>
constructive agenda that actually can entice people to join. If you 
<br>
instead look mainly at the negative side you will become a centralist 
<br>
and lose the cooperation with people.
