<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Are you sure that's a small fraction of the cases?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People always say that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; skewed by only being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to measure those who are caught. So much

</em><br>
<em>&gt; instance, and never returned, so that it seems to me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that most theft is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually completely successful. 
</em><br>
<p>The only reliable source of the numbers is law
<br>
enforcement officials themselves - and one could
<br>
easily suspect that data of being forged, deliberately
<br>
or not, towards lower-IQ criminals.
<br>
<p>That said, there is a theoretical reason why criminals
<br>
are, on the average, not that bright.  In most
<br>
societies, the majority of laws are made for the
<br>
benefit of the governed, and more importantly
<br>
represent behavior that certain people find
<br>
objectionable.  People can and do increase their own
<br>
wealth (or whatever they find valuable, such as
<br>
spiritual enlightenment, but even that requires at
<br>
least some resources to keep body and soul together)
<br>
by a wide variety of means, but some methods are more
<br>
likely to get said wealth taken away afterwards than
<br>
others.  It is little coincidence that the greatest
<br>
sources of wealth happen to be those that bring at
<br>
least small measures of wealth to just about everyone
<br>
else.  For instance, no matter what one may think of
<br>
CEOs of large corporations, the fact remains that said
<br>
corporations are providing something of value to
<br>
people, else they would have no customers and would
<br>
not be large.  (Which is not to say that some of said
<br>
figures do not also turn to criminal activities to
<br>
boost their revenues.  But the ones that do are
<br>
newsworthy because they are exceptions: less than 10%
<br>
of all corporate executives in the US were indicted on
<br>
insider trading or the like so far this year, probably
<br>
far less.  Source for that: NYSE lists 3008
<br>
US-headquartered corporations at this time.  There is
<br>
at least one CxO per company - probably far more, but
<br>
we can prove without research that there is at least
<br>
one.  Further, there are several corporations not on
<br>
the NYSE; NASDAQ has at least 100.  But the SEC has
<br>
only launched 309 administrative actions so far this
<br>
year.  309 &lt; (3008 + 100) * .1)
