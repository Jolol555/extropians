<p><em>&gt; Already I fail my resolution to avoid posting on

<p>Never mind spike. Human societies are inherently 
<br>
political. We can choose to participate or too observe
<br>
but we have a real hard time hopping out of the road
<br>
of others who decide to play politics, so maybe it 
<br>
behoves us to participate at least a bit. Just nicely and
<br>
carefully.

<em>&gt; &gt; Brett, the disembodied brain needs to come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Taxifornia.  One need not be a legal person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to vote here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Wow! I'm treating this as serious (but bearing in mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm talking to the spikester)...Brett
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are too kind, Brett, but in this case, yes I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; serious. 
</em><br>
<p>I recalled your comments on the ease of voting in CA.
<br>
In Oz we take voting so seriously its compulsory 
<br>
dammit. Or at least one must attend the booth, 
<br>
(travel not tax deductible and draw a jackass or
<br>
something on the polling paper to satisfy the law).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the last election I noted that the poll 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers were asking for only signatures when picking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up the ballots, but were not doing *any* checking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against previous signatures.  I produced my driver's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; license, which they refuse to look at, and informed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; me that they were specifically *forbidden* to request
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *any* personal identification, at which time I asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what measures, if any, were being taken to discourage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive voter fraud.  There were absolutely none.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The discussion began to grow mildly heated, as I pointed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out that the results of this &quot;election&quot; were nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than a casual opinion poll, except with a higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty rating and muuuuch higher stakes.  Then I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realized I was preaching to the choir.  These were simply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; innocent volunteer poll workers, so there was no point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in spoiling their day.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Historians may now claim that the current president 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won the election by a landslide because the results 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from Taxifornia were invalid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; On the bright side, Our governor is hoping to save his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job by allowing illegal immigrants to get a valid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Taxifornia driver's license.  They have pulled out the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requirement for fingerprints or any other biometric, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (privacy concerns and all that) so all I need to do is claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be an illegal immigrant from Canada in order to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a convenient second drivers license with another ID number 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and address for use whenever I am pulled over by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boys in blue.  Those who have lost driver's privileges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for any reason can do likewise, then transfer the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; license to another state in order to avoid a cloud
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of suspicion, like all Taxifornia licenses will soon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ah, my blood pressure has just dropped by several 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred  torr, just venting that one paragraph.  {8-]
</em><br>
<p>Wow again! And I'm not smoking anything I swear. 
<br>
<p>I reckon Arnie *could* be the logical candidate of 
<br>
concern for AI's though. 'Praps we should investigate
<br>
Arnies sources of funding for running before its too
<br>
late ;-) 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
