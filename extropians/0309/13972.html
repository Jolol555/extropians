<em>&gt;-----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt;From: Robert J. Bradbury
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It takes *at least* five mutations for a cell to become 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancerous, 50% 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of cancerous cells have a mutation in the p53 gene, if one of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; parents gamete cells has that mutation, you are far more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;likely to get 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cancer throughout your lifetime then people without that mutation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Actually Michael, this may not be strictly true -- yes the p53 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;gene and retinoblastoma (RB gene) mutations do certainly bias 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cells towards cancer.  The standard &quot;5 mutations&quot; model is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;used mainly with colon cancer I believe.  But there are other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;types of cancer, esp. leukemia where the primary culprit is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;chromosome rearrangements (do a google on &quot;Philadelphia 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Chromosome&quot;).  
</em><br>
<p>Robert, thanks for the excellent info.  I find this topic very
<br>
interesting and will certainly do the research you suggest.  I did not
<br>
think the 'five mutation' model was completely accurate in all cases,
<br>
but from the rest of your descriptions, it seems it, or something very
<br>
similar, is the case in most forms of cancer with the exception being
<br>
luekemia.  I will definitely read up on the biological processes
<br>
responsible for leukemia.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I think the counts at this point are something like 15-20 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tumor suppressor genes (like p53 and RB) and perhaps 50-100 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;tumor promoter genes.  One generally has to get mutations in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;several of the tumor promoter genes and 1 or more of the tumor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;supressor genes before the cell becomes cancerous.  
</em><br>
<p>So the five mutation model may not describe every form of cellular
<br>
cancer, there are probably four mutation or eight mutation variants?
<br>
The number of mutations may differ, but is seems safe to say the
<br>
principle and the requirement for certain number of certain mutations to
<br>
take place is still valid.
<br>
<p>The p53 
<br>
<em>&gt;gene is a particular weak point because it seems it plays a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;critical part of deciding whether the cell should commit apoptosis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(suicide) if things get too messed up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Its not just any five mutations, but a whole score of mutations can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; occur in different places in the genome.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Yes, but I would probably say that each specific type of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancer results from an accumulation of a specific set of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutations (or genomic changes) that cause the normal cellular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control processes to become defective.  That is why you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view aging in part of the flip side of the coin from cancer.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We *know* from cancer research that mutations and chromosomal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rearrangements are taking place.  One has to ask what kind of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;damage results from the same types of mutations and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rearrangements taking place in those genes that are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;involved in tumor suppression or tumor promotion?  If one has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a few hundred genes involved in regulating cell division then 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;one has 30,000+ genes involved in dealing with other stuff.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What happens as they gradually go bad?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; At least five of the target areas have to be mutation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not strictly true as pointed out above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Eventually, all cells in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; your body (with the exception of nuerons) are child cells of parents,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Not quite accurate.  Obviously all the cells in your body are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the child cells of parent cells.  Different cells in your body 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have different regenerative schedules.  
</em><br>
<p>My main point was that once a cell gets a mutation, all of its offspring
<br>
have that same mutation (unless some are lucky enough to have that
<br>
mutation reversed accidently) Thus the older you get, the more likely
<br>
you are to have more of your cells have more and more mutations, even in
<br>
the absence of pollution or radiation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So one can view tissues that are biased towards cellular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;division as already having a genetic program with a few 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;mutations&quot; that can lead down the path to cancer.  (When was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the last time you heard of someone getting &quot;heart cancer&quot;?)
</em><br>
<p>Never have, actually.  Interesting stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Now, dealing with Robbie's claims -- I would suggest that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;go do a google on &quot;aflatoxin grain cancer&quot;.  Aflatoxin is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;toxin produced by a natural fungus that is known to cause a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mutation(s) in the p53 gene.  It is a primary source of liver 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cancer in China which has few or no constraints on the levels 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of aflatoxin that may be present in grains or peanuts (which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are particularly susceptible to the fungus).  Now could you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;please explain how a toxin produced by a natural fungus can be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considered a &quot;pollutant&quot;? 
</em><br>
<p>I think this question was rhetorical, I have been saying all along that
<br>
natural sources contribute to far more cases of cancers than man made
<br>
pollutants or radiation.  Since virtually all plants we eat are pumped
<br>
full of natural pesticides.  Whether or not natural pesticides or toxins
<br>
should be called 'pollutants' seems more of a semantic issue, though I
<br>
would answer no to that.  
<br>
<p>Robbie, is a natural toxin a 'pollutant'?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The rise in exposure to aflatoxin is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a consequence of the fact that over the last several thousand 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years humans learned to store food sources to allow them to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;survive years when crop harvests are poor. So you can die from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;starvation or you may eventually die from cancer due to long 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;term aflatoxin exposure.  Take your pick.
</em><br>
<p>I am sure there are many more examples like the one you cite, and
<br>
probably many that have nothing to do with human behavior.  It has been
<br>
only very recently that the EPA has payed *any* attention at all to
<br>
natural carcinogens.  Too busy obsessed with placing all the blame on
<br>
'evil corporations' as Robbie seems to be, instead of actually trying to
<br>
get an accurate description of reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I am not saying that there is not any evidence that pollutants 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do not contribute to cancer.  For example, there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;overwhelming evidence that some of the substances in tobacco 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;smoke -- which one can probably consider to be a pollutant -- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do contribute to mutations and cancer in a significant subset 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of the human population (in large part due to their genetic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;makeup most probably).  However other pollutants, such as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;lead, may have little relation to cancer but may instead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;impact other functions such a neuronal development or activity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am sure there are many made made pollutants which are specifically
<br>
carcinogenic, but I don't think I would consider smoking in that
<br>
category, since it is generally a chosen behavior (pollutant as in
<br>
something people get subjected to against their preferences)  But again,
<br>
I will continue to argue unless presented with evidence suggesting
<br>
otherwise that the vast majority of cancers come from diet, both what we
<br>
eat and how much of it, and for how long we have been eating it.  
<br>
<p>All this talk of Diet and cancer makes me want to stop procrastinating
<br>
and do a CR diet.
