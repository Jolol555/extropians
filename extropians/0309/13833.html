<em>&gt; ### Yes. See <a href="http://www.techcentralstation.com/090803C.html">http://www.techcentralstation.com/090803C.html</a>, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; references to Nike.
</em><br>
<p>Non-responsive.  Nike is both famous for running sweatshops which 
<br>
perpetuate poverty and lying about it.
<br>
<p>Lies will not help you here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; What's the mechanism by which this happens exactly?  Can you site any
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; historical precedent?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Free market. Poland in 1970-95, even more so later on. USA at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning of the century, industrialization by Ford, GM, etc. Etc. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. etc.
</em><br>
<p>Mechanism, think physical &quot;follow the path of resources.&quot;  Your 
<br>
historical precedence is ridiculous.  Laughable, really.  How do THEY 
<br>
show that it happens?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why would you like to reduce incentives to invest by individuals of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; limited
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means, thereby reducing economic growth, and harming everybody?
</em><br>
<p>Clearly stated above.  Read better.  Capitalism causes inhumane 
<br>
situations, the LLC is the vehicle by which it does it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Yes. By increasing the flow of capital to the mud huts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (This is not meant as a snub - I actually mean exactly what I wrote. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easier it is to invest, the more competition there is for workers, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better wages ensue)
</em><br>
<p>You mean keeping them in their mud huts?  What USUALLY happens is the 
<br>
peasants revolt and are put-down occasionally by their 
<br>
capitalist-funded leaders.  At least, this is how it works in Burma.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ### Thanks to the flow of capital, the percentage of children playing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in pee
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been steadily decreasing. The world is actually getting better 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day.
</em><br>
<p>Where do you get your stats?
<br>
<p>Here's a good place to start: <a href="http://corporatism.tripod.com/poverty.htm">http://corporatism.tripod.com/poverty.htm</a>
<br>
<p>As a matter of fact, poverty is up worldwide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; Do you seriously think that we're going to run out of poor countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; in which workers can be exploited?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Yes. The world will be getting better in the future, too.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;There is a sucker, born every minute&quot; - Barnum
<br>
<p>Rhetorical questions to which I know the answer.  Do you?
<br>
<p>What is the current population of the earth?
<br>
What percentage are &quot;poor&quot;?
<br>
Has that changed significantly over time?
<br>
<p>______________________________________________
<br>
<p>Personal questions directed to the point:
<br>
<p>Rafal, are you a multi-millionaire?
<br>
<p>Do you want to be?
<br>
How do you think someone like you could accumulate the effective labor 
<br>
of lots of other people without actually performing that labor yourself?
<br>
<p>If you are a multi-millionaire:
<br>
<p>How will you continue to benefit from your economic status without 
<br>
continuing to keep other people working for you?
<br>
How will you keep them working for you if it's not in their best 
<br>
interest?
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
