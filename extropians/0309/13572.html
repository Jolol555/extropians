</em><br>
<em>&gt;Mormonism is *much* younger than Islam but not at all violent. Many of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;world's religions were much more mellow in their beginning than later on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Besides, can the world afford to have a violent teenager over 1.3 billion

</em><br>
<p>I don't have an opinion regarding the 'age' of a religion, but I do
<br>
think that religions evolve in time, and the violent aspects do check
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>Christianity had its Reformation.. Islam has not had its own
<br>
'reformation' yet. Extremists at the edge of every religion will
<br>
always exist, but I think that Islam is ripe for an upheaval of some
<br>
of its core elements. Some Moslem scholars have observed and written
<br>
about Islam needing a 'reformation', unfortunately their ideas have
<br>
not been accepted well in their societies yet.
<br>
<p>One example of such a person is Nasr Hamid Abu Zeid. He is an
<br>
Egyptian teacher, and was a professor of Arabic Literature at Cairo
<br>
University, who has written some works that interpret the Koran in
<br>
the context of life at the time that the Koran was written. In his
<br>
book: _Criticism of Religious Discourse_, he writes,
<br>
<p>&quot;Since language develops with the development of society and
<br>
culture, providing new ideas and developing its terminology to
<br>
express more developed relations, then it is necessary and only
<br>
natural to re-interpret texts in their original historical and
<br>
social context, replacing them with more contemporary
<br>
interpretations that are more humanistic and developed, while
<br>
keeping the content of the verses stable.&quot;
<br>
<p>On 5 August 1996,  Dr Nasr Hamed Abu-Zeid was ordered to divorce
<br>
from his wife after being branded an apostate by the Court of
<br>
Cassation. The court  confirmed a decision by the Cairo Court
<br>
of Appeals in June 1995 where the verdict stated:
<br>
<p>&quot;The court announces the separation of the first defendant [Dr
<br>
Abu-Zeid] from his wife, the second defendant, because of the
<br>
former's apostasy and because she is a Muslim. And the court calls
<br>
on the first defendant to repent to God Almighty and to return to
<br>
the Islamic religion which was brought as a light to the people to
<br>
being them happiness in this world and the hereafter.&quot;
<br>
<p>He is now living in exile with his wife in The Netherlands.
