<p><em>&gt; But *what* then is driving these people to
</em><br>
irrational behavior? Is it simply &quot;salvation&quot; in the
<br>
afterlife, e.g. really gone wrong mental programming? 
<br>
Social pressure?  Desire for power by the
<br>
leaders?.......
<br>
<p>..... It simply does not seem rational.
<br>
<p>What precisely is the behavior you consider
<br>
irrational?
<br>
<p>Suicide bombings?, with the attendant
<br>
willingness--even enthusiasm--for the sacrifice of
<br>
one's own life?  They call it martyrdom, which goes a
<br>
long way toward explaining it, if you consider that
<br>
similar ideas in different cultures are expressed
<br>
differently.  We call it &quot;the ultimate price&quot; or &quot;the
<br>
ultimate sacrifice&quot; or &quot;the glory of war&quot; or &quot;our
<br>
patriotic duty&quot;: the risk and sacrifice of soldiering.
<br>
&nbsp;These risks are motivated by patriotism, a desire to
<br>
earn 'glory', or heroism, or the attendant acclaim of
<br>
our nation(tribe), or social acceptance and promotion
<br>
to full adulthood, and--perhaps cynically--by the
<br>
inherent naivete of the very young.
<br>
<p>Was the war in Afghanistan, provoked by 911,
<br>
irrational?  I'm guessing you would say &quot;Clearly, no.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;And that answer would be based on your intimate
<br>
personal experience of, and thorough understanding of,
<br>
the events which motivated that war.
<br>
<p>I suggest that if you were as thoroughly versed in the
<br>
Muslim experience, from living within it and being
<br>
informed by its information 'environment'   
<br>
(memetics), you would find the Arab/Islamic view to be
<br>
as self-evidently logical as was the Afghan war.
<br>
<p>It boils down to our media trains us, their media
<br>
trains them.  Misunderstanding, prejudice, and then
<br>
finally, conflict, result from the mutual invalidity
<br>
of half-truths.  The mutual invalidity of tribal myth.
<br>
<p>[I haven't yet read the rest of this thread, so if I'm
<br>
behind the curve, covering territory already surveyed,
<br>
please excuse; or as Rosanne Rosannadanna used to say,
<br>
&quot;Nevermind.&quot;] 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't see things as they are, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we see them as we are.&quot; 
<br>
