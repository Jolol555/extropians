<p>
There is a real axiomatic difference between collectivists and 
<br>
individualists, and it's likely to persist indefinitely. This reminds me 
<br>
of a cellular automaton experiment (Forgot the reference, anybody 
<br>
remember? It was in Science) where they found that neither strategy 
<br>
consistantly &quot;wins&quot; in the simulation... the &quot;winning&quot; side depends upon 
<br>
starting conditions, is hard to predict, and often the simulation just 
<br>
keeps on going in a perpetual state of flux between the two rival 
<br>
strategies.
<br>
<p>I think that's what the debate between individualists and collectivists 
<br>
is like, and I think it will last throught the next *several* singularities.
<br>
<p>That being said, the collectivist side in *this* particular thread may 
<br>
do well to read up on game theory. You will never convince anybody who 
<br>
doesn't agree with you to begin with if you proceed on the demonstrably 
<br>
false assumption that everything is a zero sum game.
<br>
<p>I'm deliberately not naming names to avoid a defensive reaction. Simply, 
<br>
within the privacy of your own brain, if the terms &quot;positive sum game&quot; 
<br>
and &quot;zero sum game&quot; are kind of vague, then google them and read up on 
<br>
them. I might do the googling myself and post the links later if I have 
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Also, it looks like there's a terminological disagreement over the term 
<br>
'value'. Some people hold the axiom that value stems from the labor put 
<br>
into a product (value to the seller) and some hold the axiom that value 
<br>
stems from the usefulness of a product (value to the buyer). This can be 
<br>
completely sidestepped by instead talking about 'price', and that might 
<br>
be what you mean in the first place anyway. If we're talking about 
<br>
price, then it's determined simply by what gets exchanged for what. In a 
<br>
pure command economy it's determined by the governing body. In a pure 
<br>
market economy it's determined by the market. Usually it's a mix of 
<br>
both. Price objective, value subjective.
<br>
<p>Sorry if I'm stating the obvious.
