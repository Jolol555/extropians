<p>Huh? Neural networks can become overtrained if they are too large and 
<br>
get too little data - they learn each individual piece of data but does 
<br>
not generalize them to intermediary values. Attractor neural networks 
<br>
can also suffer from catastrophic forgetting: they can store a finite 
<br>
amount of information, but if they are trained with more they forget 
<br>
everything and become useless, unable to either learn or retrieve. The 
<br>
&quot;solution&quot; is to make them forgetful, so that they forget old or 
<br>
irrelevant information, or make them extend themselves with new neurons 
<br>
as needed.
<br>
<p>Looking at your post, your thrust seem to be that our civilization is 
<br>
getting too rigid, locked into non-adaptable patterns. A bit like 
<br>
catastrophic forgetting: we have filled our potential of complexity, and 
<br>
adding anything more will break the patterns. I think this is an overly 
<br>
pessimistic view. I rather think the situation is like selforganised 
<br>
criticality. Whenever things get too rigid and blocked, they build up 
<br>
pressure and eventually break. The result is a state of dynamic 
<br>
equilibrium where large and small changes occurs. Sometimes this results 
<br>
in dramatic and painful cascades, sometimes in minor disturbances. The 
<br>
small disturbances are far more common than the big ones and serve to 
<br>
prevent them (typical examples are brushfires, which prevent larger 
<br>
forest fires). Maybe the real threat would be if a global civilization 
<br>
manages to hold off such changes too long - the pressure builds up, and 
<br>
when the shift comes it hurts a lot of people. That's why I'm happy 
<br>
there are still mongolian horsemen on the Asian steppes - they are a 
<br>
valuable backup.
