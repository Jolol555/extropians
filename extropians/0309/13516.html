<em>&gt;Interesting. I did a google probably much the same as you would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I expect, (or probably less adeptly), and I'm not ever sure its more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an &quot;old&quot; urban myth.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;  <a href="http://www.bbk.ac.uk/eh/eng/skc/artlaugh.htm">http://www.bbk.ac.uk/eh/eng/skc/artlaugh.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Seems to be at least an academic paper on the subject written in 1998.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;A find on &quot;lost&quot; pulls up the following paragraph.
</em><br>
[...]
<br>
<p><em>&gt;How far did you get towards concluding there might actually have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;been such a book?
</em><br>
<p>I didn't know if Aristotle's second book was urban legend or a fact,
<br>
commonly accepted. I read through Aristotle's _Poetics_ last
<br>
weekend, looking where Aristotle was said to have discussed it. He
<br>
discusses tragedies, but barely mentions comedies. If that is what
<br>
people mean, when they say the book is 'lost', then it is tantalizing,
<br>
but not convincing (to me), at all. However, I read it in English,
<br>
so I would need a Greek person to tell me if Aristotle wrote something
<br>
strongly implied in Greek, that was missed by the translator.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;For some reason that I don't get, the formal study of laughter has never
</em><br>
<em>&gt;really intrigued, as much as it should.
</em><br>
<p>I know.
<br>
<p>or the INformal study of laughter. You will find the archetype of Tricksters
<br>
and Jokesters and Clowns in the folk tales and myths, where they play
<br>
important roles, turning your psychological perspectives upside down.
<br>
<p>Also going back centuries are the Sufic tales of Mulla Nasrudin. He's
<br>
a jokester and a sage, forcing you to arrive at profound concepts, to 
<br>
see a situation from a completely different perspective with the aid 
<br>
of laughter.
