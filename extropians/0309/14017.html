ExI - Changing the Game (September 16, 2003)
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
<p>Dear Natasha,
<br>
<p>Extropy Institute has grown from a groundbreaking 
<br>
futurist organization to a worldwide incubator for 
<br>
solutions.  Having spent the last 15 years developing 
<br>
a grid for transhumanity, ExI is now going in a new 
<br>
direction.  In doing so, we've taken the &quot;ism&quot; out of 
<br>
extropy and 
<br>
heading toward the many cultural, economic and 
<br>
technological riddles that wait to be solved and the 
<br>
questions that need to be answered. ExI's 
<br>
design of thinking systems and solutions for the future 
<br>
will unfold over the next year as we approach business 
<br>
structures and 
<br>
educational systems, probe each others brains and 
<br>
nourish the very environment from which we thrive.  
<br>
Right now it's time to 
<br>
move on to new gardens. Hey, it's an uphill trek - we're 
<br>
packing a new website, 
<br>
new mission, and new principles, for a new direction.  
<br>
Come along - the sky is still blue, Mars is in the 
<br>
southwest just before dawn, and tonight Sirius will 
<br>
shine brightly in reflection of our deepest 
<br>
desires.
<br>
<p>CONGRATULATIONS to DAVID McFADZEAN!  ExI's 
<br>
Directors 
<br>
elected David McFadzean to the board.  David has 
<br>
contributed enormous Internet savvy and strategic 
<br>
business development to ExI and we decided that his 
<br>
talents are indispensable for our future.

<br>
<p><p>WHY DO WE NEED EXTROPIC SOLUTIONS?
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
Human beings achieved &quot;civilization&quot; thousands of years 
<br>
ago. Yet we have not shaken off the ancient tyrannies 
<br>
that haunt the human condition. We suffer physical and 
<br>
emotional sicknesses ending in decrepitude and death. 
<br>
The primitive parts of our brain spur us to envy, to 
<br>
hate, to despair, and to kill. Our philosophies and our 
<br>
religions attempt to express our highest values, yet we 
<br>
use them to oppress and control. We use them to crush 
<br>
the world's complexity into a simplicity that we can 
<br>
clutch like a security blanket for the human condition.
<br>
<p>Human ingenuity has created astonishing institutions 
<br>
and technologies to remedy these problems. Yet our 
<br>
intellectual and emotional limitations often spawn new 
<br>
problems from our attempted solutions, while our 
<br>
primitive drives find ways to abuse them. The ever-
<br>
accelerating pace of change breeds anxiety even as it 
<br>
glimmers with hope. Powerful technologies ever more 
<br>
rapidly shake up entire cultures and economies as well 
<br>
as each individual life. As we continue to experiment 
<br>
with technology using legacy brains and antiquated 
<br>
strategies, uncertainty and anxiety continue to plague 
<br>
us.

<br>
<p>ExI's NEW MISSION STATEMENT
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
Extropy Institute sees enormous potential in advanced 
<br>
decision making and strategic thinking, coupled with 
<br>
emerging sciences and technologies, to quicken 
<br>
humanity's resolution of these fundamental problems. 
<br>
We aim to gradually but firmly change the rules of the 
<br>
game called &quot;being human&quot;.
<br>
<p>In pursuit of our mission, Extropy Institute assembles 
<br>
individuals from diverse domains of expertise. We gather 
<br>
these ambitious, daring minds to combine creative and 
<br>
executive approaches to expose the fundamental roots 
<br>
of our problems. We see this advanced, multi-faceted 
<br>
solution-seeking as the best way to create a radically 
<br>
better future.
<br>
<p>We need not remain slaves to our cultural and 
<br>
evolutionary history. For centuries, cultures around the 
<br>
world saw human slavery as part of the natural order, 
<br>
until they were shown irrefutably otherwise. Likewise 
<br>
today, many of us passively accept or stridently defend 
<br>
the inevitability of human stupidity, malice, conflict, 
<br>
aging, and death. We invite you to participate in our 
<br>
mission to connect and cultivate the ingenious and 
<br>
intrepid shapers of the future.

<p>NEW! &quot;Extropy-Chat&quot; Email List
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
Welcome to the &quot;Extropy-Chat&quot; List.  ExI's new email 
<br>
list is launched today.
<br>
<p>ExI's email list is the longest running transhumanist 
<br>
email list in the world. Now entering its second decade, 
<br>
the Extropy-Chat (formerly &quot;Extropians&quot;) email list is 
<br>
open to ExI members and non-members alike. It is a 
<br>
general-purpose discussion forum. The List covers all 
<br>
manner of topics over time, and you can search back 
<br>
several years through the archives on the Web to find 
<br>
previous posts on topics that interest you. We also 
<br>
provide a daily digest version for those who prefer 
<br>
receiving fewer emails.
<br>
<p>Over the years, this List hosted innovative discussions 
<br>
on the Internet continuously since 1991. We welcome 
<br>
innovative discussions pertaining to scientific, 
<br>
technological, philosophical, artistic, economic, and 
<br>
social perspectives on the future.
<br>
<p>Please be aware that the content of the Extropy-Chat 
<br>
List does not automatically reflect Extropy Institute or 
<br>
the philosophy of extropy itself. As with most mailing 
<br>
lists, it reflects opinions on various subjects and the 
<br>
posts therein should not be viewed as official 
<br>
endorsements of Extropy Institute or vice versa.
<br>
<p>Please carefully read the List Agreement below, 
<br>
followed by more information about the Extropy-Chat 
<br>
List.
<br>
<p>Welcome!

<br>
<p>ExI Launches New Website!
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
Along with a new mission, new email list, revised 
<br>
principles, and new business strategy, ExI launches 
<br>
its new website. ExI will have a more comprehensive 
<br>
resources page, 
<br>
media and PR page, and a page specifically for &quot;The 
<br>
Futurists QUIZ.&quot;  Along with the QUIZ, we are also 
<br>
launching a new email list, &quot;ExI-Solutions&quot;, by invitation 
<br>
only.
<br>
<p>While the new website reflects the new direction of 
<br>
ExI, some of its pages are still being designed as I write 
<br>
this.  If you have talents in the area of web design or 
<br>
digital 
<br>
media, please let us know.  In return for your talents, 
<br>
we will provide a free membership to ExI.
<br>

<p>Principles of Extropy, Version 3.1  (by Max More, Chairman)
<br>
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<br>
An evolving framework of values and standards
<br>
for continuously improving the human condition
<br>
<p>Prologue: What is the Purpose of the Principles of 
<br>
Extropy?
<br>
<p>Philosophies of life rooted in centuries-old traditions 
<br>
contain much wisdom concerning personal, 
<br>
organizational, and social living. Many of us also find 
<br>
shortcomings in those traditions. How could they not 
<br>
reach some mistaken conclusions when they arose in 
<br>
pre-scientific times? At the same time, ancient 
<br>
philosophies of life have little or nothing to say about 
<br>
fundamental issues confronting us as advanced 
<br>
technologies begin to enable us to change our identity 
<br>
as individuals and as humans and as economic, cultural, 
<br>
and political forces change global relationships.
<br>
<p>The Principles of Extropy first took shape in the late 
<br>
1980s to outline an alternative lens through which to 
<br>
view the emerging and unprecedented opportunities, 
<br>
challenges, and dangers. The goal was  and is  to use 
<br>
current scientific understanding along with critical and 
<br>
creative thinking to define a small set of principles or 
<br>
values that could help make sense of the confusing but 
<br>
potentially liberating and existentially enriching 
<br>
capabilities opening up to humanity.
<br>
<p>The Principles of Extropy do not specify particular 
<br>
beliefs, technologies, or policies. The Principles do not 
<br>
pretend to be a complete philosophy of life. The world 
<br>
does not need another totalistic dogma. The Principles 
<br>
of Extropy do consist of a handful of principles (or 
<br>
values or perspectives) that codify proactive, life-
<br>
affirming and life-promoting ideals. Individuals who 
<br>
cannot comfortably adopt traditional value systems 
<br>
often find the Principles of Extropy useful as postulates 
<br>
to guide, inspire, and generate innovative thinking 
<br>
about existing and emerging fundamental personal, 
<br>
organizational, and social issues.
<br>
<p>The Principles are intended to be enduring, underlying 
<br>
ideals and standards. At the same time, both in content 
<br>
and by being revised, the Principles do not claim to be 
<br>
eternal truths or certain truths. I invite other 
<br>
independent thinkers who share the agenda of acting 
<br>
as change agents for fostering better futures to 
<br>
consider the Principles of Extropy as an evolving 
<br>
framework of attitudes, values, and standards  and as 
<br>
a shared vocabulary  to make sense of our 
<br>
unconventional, secular, and life-promoting responses 
<br>
to the changing human condition. I also invite feedback 
<br>
to further refine these Principles.
