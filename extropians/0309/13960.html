<br>
buy us a few more years.  Doesn't make it ethical, but makes it a bit more 
<br>
understandable.  (It's also why France got so pissed off at us.  They had made 
<br>
arrangements to acquire that oil, and we stole it.  Were I France, I'd be pissed 
<br>
off too.  But their arrangements were only slightly more ethical than ours.  
<br>
Well, maybe twice as ethical.  But still pretty far from any base line.)
<br>
<p>Charles,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amidst that flock of charges and off hand opinions I believe you made 
<br>
one flat statement that might be pinned down as fact or fiction.  As you made 
<br>
the statement &quot;...we stole it...&quot; would you please document that remark?
