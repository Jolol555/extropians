<p><em>&gt; Aubrey, my readings right now suggest that the ALT pathway for

</em><br>
<p>Correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It makes sense since telomeres are essentially identical and so

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty darn difficult.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  The key point is that just swapping bits of DNA between
<br>
telomeres can do very little to stave off cell senescence and/or
<br>
death (always death in the case of cancer cells because they have
<br>
already overcome the senescence response in order to reach crisis
<br>
in the first place), because all it does is ensure that one short
<br>
telomere doesn't trigger death prematurely.  For indefinite (or
<br>
even much extended) cell division you need DNA replication.  DNA
<br>
repair involves a tiny bit of replication, but only a tiny bit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One would presumably turn down the ability to do homologous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recombination repair system as the telomeres shorten.  But I suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will be tissues where that has a significant negative impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (in terms of cell replacement capacity).
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  The reason we know it's wrong is just that ALT is evidently
<br>
as hard to activate as telomerase is, even in cells like skeletal
<br>
muscle satellite cells where telomerase is fabulously well shut down.
<br>
So, even though at this point we don't know what aspects of our DNA
<br>
repair machinery are involved in ALT, we can actually be reasonably
<br>
confident that at least some of that machinery is very well turned
<br>
off in normal cells.  That's not as surprising as it sounds, because
<br>
it doesn't imply anything for the activity of DNA repair generally:
<br>
the get-out is that there are many genes that have no constitutive
<br>
role, and only operate in unusual cells, e.g. in meiosis.  Meiosis
<br>
is the best bet, in my view, for a process some of whose machinery
<br>
is essential for ALT.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One of the problems is that we don't fully understand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the degree to which telomere extension needs to be tuned
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for specific tissues based on their cell division rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect the optimal balance between telomere extending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and shortening is not attained in many tissues.
</em><br>
<p>All true, but irrelevant if we get WILT to work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On a positive note, though I can't discuss it, Juvensa may be on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the path towards a &quot;homologous recombination-based gene therapy&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approach that may be workable.  If that plays out in a successful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way you will have a much greater toolbox to work with.
</em><br>
<p>All true.  (I know plenty about that work of course as I am on the
<br>
Juvensa scientific advisory board.)
