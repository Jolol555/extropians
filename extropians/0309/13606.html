<p>
The open question then is this:
<br>
<p>Say N is an action of itself Bad (going to war, dropping bombs, etc.)
<br>
Say M is an action of itself Not as Bad as N (stepping up economic 
<br>
sanctions).
<br>
<p>Say that N &amp; M both have the same likelihood of bringing about R 
<br>
(Iraq's long-term change to a peaceful society).
<br>
<p>My contention is that we should do M, not N and in particular since we 
<br>
have OPTIONS, that is, it is reasonable to conclude that we could 
<br>
accomplish our goals given either chosen path, then we should do the 
<br>
good one.
<br>
<p>We were in agreement on this point - if your principles are that you 
<br>
should do whatever will, in the short and long run, cause the least 
<br>
harm, then you are obliged to act.  We will continue to agree that that 
<br>
means &quot;Forced&quot;.  However, if those are not your principles, then you 
<br>
should change your principles.
<br>
<p>You seem to think that my position leaves me in an unreasonably 
<br>
reactive position.  But this is based on the idea that the only way to 
<br>
react to a threat is direct force.  But that's clearly false.
<br>
<p>If the Germans are amassing tanks and have cut off diplomatic relations 
<br>
with you, you pretty much know that they're going to attack and not 
<br>
preparing for that attack would be suicidal and hence morally 
<br>
objectionable.
<br>
<p>While the germans are amassing tanks, though, the options are open to 
<br>
amass tanks yourself, providing a route to a peaceful step, or to 
<br>
attack pre-emptively.
<br>
<p>You're right that the standard always prevents you from attacking 
<br>
pre-emptively unless you have no ability to match forces with your 
<br>
oponent (as in the &quot;terrorist&quot; attacks on the part of our current 
<br>
oponnents - they have no choice but to attack &quot;irrationally&quot; since 
<br>
nothing they can do will likely accomplish their goals).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You've placed the burden of proof too high, in my opinion.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we would put the matter this way - If we thought with higher 
<br>
certainty that Iraq was a genuine immediate danger, we should act as 
<br>
quickly as possible to alleviate that danger.  There are LOTS of ways 
<br>
of doing this.
<br>
<p>In cases where there are fewer ways of doing that, then the rationality 
<br>
of a military solution comes more clearly into focus.
<br>
<p>IF you don't take the attitude that military force is a last resort, 
<br>
then you're really just being opportunistic and frankly too optimistic 
<br>
that &quot;things will work themselves out in the end&quot; since we know that 
<br>
we're starting with something fundamentally objectionable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Luddites have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sought to do with the so-called &quot;Precationary Principle;&quot; they've 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stacked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the deck against action.
</em><br>
<p>I thought we weren't going to do any name-calling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ultimately you'll be judged by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that history is the judge.  The harm that is done is 
<br>
immediate - number of dead people.  If history is the judge, then 
<br>
Alexander can be made to be a hero or murderer, it depends on whether 
<br>
you're a greek or a turk.  But if we count it OBJECTIVELY, we know that 
<br>
Alexander was a murderer, an imperialist conqueror and we judge him by 
<br>
the number of bodies he left behind.
<br>
<p>Consider the possibility that in the long-term some NAZI-like military 
<br>
government will prevail - in that case History will judge that Hitler 
<br>
was a visionary.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judgment of bull-headed self-righteousness will have been correct.
</em><br>
<p>Ignoring the &quot;bull-headed&quot; and &quot;self-righteous&quot; adjectives for the 
<br>
moment...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember the judgment of Churchill in the 1930s -- most people saw him 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grumbling crank.
</em><br>
<p>The case is not parallel.  The Germans were already militarily active, 
<br>
the question was whether they'd stop at the channel and whether England 
<br>
by amassing force could make an impenetrable wall that Germany would be 
<br>
too scared of to cross.  They couldn't, in either case preparing for 
<br>
war is better than actually going to war.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p>What do you estimate was the relative probability that Iraq was going 
<br>
to Invade, say, Turkey, Iran or Kuwait as of January 2003?
<br>
<p>Oppose that to the likelihood that Germany would invade Poland circa 
<br>
1944.  That some people assign probabilities differently isn't at 
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>I don't know if there's an &quot;objective probability&quot; but I estimate the 
<br>
probability that Iraq would invade Iran, Kuwait or Turkey at less than 
<br>
0%.  Certainly the probability that they would invade the US is less 
<br>
than 0%.
<br>
<p>Given the status of the UN inspections regime and economic sanctions, I 
<br>
estimate their ability (pre 2003) to generate a viable military force 
<br>
within the next 20 years as negligible (they'd have to get some very 
<br>
serious cooperation from some very large powerhouses to make up the 
<br>
delta between their forces and even the forces of say Turkey, let alone 
<br>
the combined forces of NATO or the UN!)
<br>
<p>How do you estimate that probability?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this, you're being consistent: With the standard of moral certainty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you've set, one could not act until the tanks actually cross the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; border, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would think.  After all, they may just be having a parade!
</em><br>
<p>Not at all. If the Germans are having a tank parade, we should have a 
<br>
BIGGER tank parade.  That tends to prevent them from crossing the 
<br>
border.
<br>
<p>In the Iraqi case, there was as far as I can tell, no danger whatever 
<br>
that they would cross the border.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me end by saying that I came to support the war in Iraq late and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with great reluctance.  Nevertheless, I expect to be judged harshly by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend and foe if things go disasterously wrong.  Heck, I'll probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; judged harshly no matter what!
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the point of the discourse is to Judge but rather to 
<br>
re-acquire a sense of what was lost.
<br>
<p>Prior to the Iraqi conflict, the standard for War was &quot;clear and 
<br>
present danger&quot; which was interpreted as an amassing of identified and 
<br>
confirmed force on the part of a clearly identified enemy.
<br>
<p>That standard was loosened to include &quot;rumors&quot; - recalling the infamous 
<br>
16-words &quot;British Intelligence says...&quot; and &quot;unconfirmed innuendo&quot; - 
<br>
the famous UN presentation by Colin Powell and merely potential 
<br>
long-term future threats.
<br>
<p>As a rule, there are long-term potential future threats.  As I said 
<br>
elsewhere, the only way to deal with the possibility of a 5-man crew 
<br>
putting together a series of nuclear weapons in a technologically 
<br>
advancing society is either by putting an end to the technological 
<br>
advancement or genuinely making peace with all humans.  If you always 
<br>
react against long-term possible threats, then the reasonable thing to 
<br>
do is kill everyone that isn't demonstrably loyal to you.
<br>
<p>Otherwise, there will be Hot-Heads who are both capable and willing to 
<br>
go to war &quot;By whatever means necessary&quot;.
<br>
<p>To have a long-term strategy of pre-emptive strikes is to invite 
<br>
competition and force, per the game theory of Prof. Nash, only by 
<br>
making concessions and engendering long-term cooperation will we be 
<br>
able to create a future safe for our future selves and children.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie Lindauer
