<em>&gt; Ok, Greg, I'll wade into these waters (though I realize it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably foolish to do so).  [Someday, the Extropian List Principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should include a list of people that one should never never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue with.]
</em><br>
<p>No, no, no Robert :-) 
<br>
<p>I agree with what I think is your contention that Greg's post was 
<br>
excellent. I'm actually very much enjoying the current exchanges on
<br>
the list on law (and politics) especially between Greg and Barbara 
<br>
and now between Greg and Robbie and am mindful that Greg has
<br>
other demands on his time too, (indeed we all have) but I really 
<br>
hope we (extropians) never get the point when there are any people
<br>
who are formally listed as not to be argued with. I am sure you jest
<br>
&nbsp;- but any newbies please take note that that is my view of Robert's
<br>
statement. 
<br>
<p>I would like to explore some of the issues Greg raises in his post
<br>
as well, (but not in this post), I think, there is much wisdom in 
<br>
Anders recent comment in another thread that we (transhumanists 
<br>
I presume) need to be get are arguments sharp as it is the status
<br>
quo that we are trying to change and we are not the only ones with
<br>
visions of a possible futures. I was less certain that Anders was right
<br>
in saving sharpening the arguments is the *first* step. We must get
<br>
our arguments sharp to change the status quo that is true but I think
<br>
even before that we need to be able to triage and prioritise issues. 
<br>
<p>I do not have too much trouble envisioning to a fairly high degree
<br>
of detail how the commercial and technological wherewithal to
<br>
radically extend life may be achieved even without GAI within 
<br>
a couple of decades. I do have trouble though factoring into 
<br>
my mapping of such a possible futures the great uncertainties
<br>
that exist in international law. International law or the lack of it
<br>
has the potential to unsettle everything. It is the big factor X
<br>
on the horizon. International law relates to the relations between
<br>
countries which relates to economics and human rights and 
<br>
everything down stream of those. Politics (international law and
<br>
politics) can stymie technological development at least for 
<br>
timeframes that are not insignificant for individual humans with
<br>
our current lifespans. I have seen this up close with the international
<br>
stem cell debate in which I am certain that politics and law (including
<br>
international and intellectual property law) has slowed the rate of 
<br>
basic research and created bottlenecks in the pipeline of the 
<br>
development of therapies.  
<br>
<p>I respect that the Exi list is not about partisan politics, and agree
<br>
that it should not be, however politics (in the broad sense) and the
<br>
laws by which humans live and organise themselves sensibly be 
<br>
off-limits to any transhumanist agenda in my view unless we are
<br>
content to be an esoteric enclave. We must engage politically at
<br>
times because we will be treated politically whether we do or not.
<br>
<p>Now to me, it is very clear that most existing ideologies and 
<br>
party platforms are not going to be embraced wholesale by 
<br>
transhumanist but it is not so clear how we can go about triaging
<br>
the problems that remain and require solutions between us.
<br>
<p>I do however think that international law (whether it exist or works
<br>
or not) and the relationship of the most powerful country in the 
<br>
world to the future of the world will be of *great* importance. 
<br>
I also think it is important for us to realise that technology may 
<br>
have the effect of placing enormous propaganda power in the 
<br>
hands of fewer and fewer individuals. Even the brightest of us can
<br>
only make good decisions on the basis of the information we 
<br>
receive. This means that there are good grounds for us to be 
<br>
mindful of the quality of the information we receive. It is no good
<br>
arguing flawlessly from flawed axioms and it is no good having a 
<br>
great understanding of world events and ideas if our information
<br>
base itself is getting increasingly smaller and subject to the power
<br>
of fewer and fewer individuals and governments. 
<br>
<p>The internet can be a great tool for providing diversity of sources
<br>
but it is not completely untouchable by governments that may be
<br>
tempted to control the sources of information that citizen voters
<br>
receive. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett
