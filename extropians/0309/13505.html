<p><em>&gt; Roughly simultaneously, Reason cried out in pain:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Narry a mention of the job creation in new industries, just the same old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; zero-sum protectionist nonsense based on the assumption that people are
</em><br>
owed
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; security and a livelihood with no effort on their part, funded by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wealthy via forced redistribution of wealth. Even the anti-capitalist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anti-free-market arguments in this thing are tired and by the numbers,
</em><br>
pushing the
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effects of government intervention (no5t labeled as such, of course) in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; trade and markets as reasons for more government intervention. It's sad,
</em><br>
sad,
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sad. And stupid. Massively, massively stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt; coff &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd demur on that `massively, massively stupid', obviously.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Reason, I think you're jumping the gun. Brain's case is precisely that
</em><br>
there *can't* be
<br>
<em>&gt; much in the way of `job creation in new industries' for the robotically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; downsized (unless I'm reading that in). I found his suggestions most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laughable when he tried to give his prescription a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; `turbo-capitalist' spin:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selling advertising space on the rear of greenbacks, under public bridges,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the Washington Memorial. Pure '50s Pohl&amp;Kornbluth parody. But if his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remedies are incomplete, that's where people like us need to step in with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some imagination.
</em><br>
<p>I'm prepared to go out on a limb and say that automation (basically
<br>
increased efficiency, the same work done by fewer people) will never result
<br>
in a state in which there *can't* be job creation in new industries or in
<br>
old industries invigorated by said automation.
<br>
<p>I don't see any difference between the coming automation and the process of
<br>
automation that's been happening since the industrial revolution got
<br>
underway. A failure to imagine new industries and whole new areas of
<br>
productive human labor open to people displaced by robots (indeed, *enabled*
<br>
by the use of those robots) doesn't mean those things don't exist. Just like
<br>
the same failure to figure out what all those farm laborers in 1900 would be
<br>
doing as they were replaced by farm automation, and all those household
<br>
domestics would be doing as they were replaced by household
<br>
automation...things seem to be just fine as a result of those enormous gains
<br>
in automation (making 99% or so of those previous workers redundant), and
<br>
we're all better off for it. If you asked the man on the street in 1900 what
<br>
the millions of farm workers would be doing with themselves, I doubt you'd
<br>
have got a good answer.
