<br>
<p>&quot;When NASA killed Saturn, they killed more than the vehicle...Two of
<br>
these launches could have put the entire ISS as it currently is
<br>
configured in orbit!&quot;
<br>
<p><p>Welllll, that might be a bit of overstatement.  There is
<br>
more to the ISS than lifting mass.  They have a tremendous
<br>
build-on-orbit task that requires astronauts and time.  I 
<br>
suppose they might have been able to park the pieces on orbit 
<br>
somehow, then send up astronauts by some means.
<br>
<p><p>I have heard that the Saturn 5 blueprints were destroyed -- does anyone
<br>
know if this claim is valid or an urban legend?
<br>
<p><p>Robert that is a far more complex question than it appears.
<br>
I have heard this for years.  I heard it came out of a
<br>
a heated discussion at a congressional committee meeting
<br>
in the late 1970s when it became clear that the space shuttle
<br>
would not be able to carry as much load as was anticipated.
<br>
A proposal was made to build more Saturn Vs, at which time 
<br>
hot-head made the famous accusation that NASA had 
<br>
intentionally destroyed the documentation in order to push
<br>
the shuttle agenda.  
<br>
<p>I asked a number of people about this and have gotten
<br>
various answers, from which I distill the following
<br>
explanation.  The accusation was an exaggeration.  NASA
<br>
microfilmed much of the documentation package and archived
<br>
some of the ink-on-vellum drawings.  This was in the days 
<br>
before CADAM, so none of it existed in soft copy.  This is 
<br>
not to say that they have a complete drawing package to 
<br>
this day, however, as it is quite probable that a *complete* 
<br>
drawing package never existed.  This is what I got from 
<br>
talking to some old-timers at Lockheed:
<br>
<p>My former boss went to work in the space program at age 23
<br>
with a freshly minted master's degree in structural engineering.
<br>
At that time they were just about to launch the first Atlas 
<br>
(he is old, but still working at LMCO).  He is a thin short
<br>
guy.  The Atlas was a bit over the target weight, not by much.
<br>
They handed him a pair of tin snips and told him to climb up
<br>
in that stage and cut away anything he was sure wouldn't hurt
<br>
the mission to do without.  {8^D  The second stage of the 
<br>
mighty Saturn V had a weight problem.  He said they did some
<br>
of those kinds of tricks again, never actually documenting
<br>
or drawing everything that had been cut away or filed off.
<br>
<p>My father was a technician for North American Rockwell as
<br>
it was called in those days.  He told of a certain subsystem
<br>
with a troublesome cover on an access port.  There was 
<br>
an old cat working out there who modified the cover by
<br>
making a pair of hinges out of a couple pieces of soft leather 
<br>
that he had fashioned.  The bird flew like that.  Thereafter, 
<br>
they used those leather replacement hinges on all the flights,
<br>
never actually documenting how to make them or epoxy them in
<br>
place, since the guy who knew how to do it had no plans of
<br>
moving on to a different career.  
<br>
<p>There were plenty of undocumented modifications made in 
<br>
those days of looser quality control than we have today.
<br>
Many of the subcontractors were not required to provide
<br>
complete documentation of their subsystems.  They didn't
<br>
offer them for free.  They didn't store them for free
<br>
either.
<br>
<p>NASA relied upon craftsmen to some extent, and these have
<br>
now gone on to retirement.  If we were going to ressurrect
<br>
the Saturn V today, we would find a lot of engineering would 
<br>
need to be redone, but this would be the case even if all the
<br>
documentation had been completed and perfectly archived,
<br>
for many of the components are no longer available.  Think
<br>
in terms of controls, switches, computer memory etc.  Where
<br>
would you find magnetic core memory today?  Where would you
<br>
find a standing army of people who understand Fortran well
<br>
enough to maintain and operate the software alone?  Think
<br>
of all the processes that they had back in those days which
<br>
used freon.
<br>
<p>The way to the future isn't back.  We have a lot of high
<br>
techy aluminum alloys now that weren't available in the 60s,
<br>
as well as composite materials.  We could build a biggie
<br>
throwaway booster again today, on the scale of the Saturn V,
<br>
only better.  But there is probably no way to do it as 
<br>
cheaply as the Russians can.  They need the money, so let's
<br>
just buy their stuff and concentrate on miniaturization of
<br>
payloads, which the US has always been very good at.  
<br>
<p>I get ridicule whenever I suggest this, but here goes:  As for
<br>
space stations and human cargo, I really think we need to
<br>
get serious about either miniaturizing people or choosing small
<br>
people for space missions.  Recall that the weight of a pressure
<br>
vessel varies as the cube of the linear dimension, so the
<br>
potential weight savings from choosing 5 foot tall astronauts
<br>
vs 6 foot tall astronauts is (5/6)^3 =.58 assuming everything
<br>
can be scaled down by five sixths.  I do not see why not, 
<br>
over 40 percent weight savings and we are still very much 
<br>
in the range of ordinary sized humans.  Shrimpy humans but 
<br>
still very ordinary sized.  I think we can find people
<br>
smaller than that if keep in mind that we have a pool of
<br>
6E9 people to choose from.
