-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: Chuck Kuecker
<br>
<p>Subject: Excel - was RE: How do you calm down the hot-heads?
<br>
<p><p>As far as I am concerned, Mr. Gates more than made up for Excel with 
<br>
Windows...
<br>
<p><p>Ja, so don't use it.
<br>
<p><p><p>...Anyway, which came first - Excel or Lotus 123? Seems to me Lotus was
<br>
out 
<br>
first, and Microsoft stole their lunch... Chuck Kuecker
<br>
<p><p>Ja, Lotus was first, and Visicalc was before
<br>
either of those, but both Lotus and Excel made
<br>
important contributions.  Excel couldn'ta devoured
<br>
Lotus' lunch if it wasn't better.  Either way, its a
<br>
first class engineering tool.  Granted, windows
<br>
is a last class system, and many of us are stuck
<br>
using it, but at home we still have the Mac choice.
