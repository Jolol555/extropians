Discovered something...

<p>I think a trip to the National Library in Naples is in my future

<p><p>Richard Janko on Philodemus
<br>
<p>Understanding one of the richest periods in the history of human thought
<br>
<p>&lt;begin quote&gt;
<br>
<p>In 1986, browsing among the new periodicals in a college library in
<br>
America, I came across an article by a recently deceased Italian
<br>
scholar. In it he lamented that nobody had noticed his work on a
<br>
papyrus from Herculaneum, first published in 1955. In his edition he
<br>
had shown that new fragments of Aristotle's lost dialogue On Poets
<br>
are cited in a work on literary theory by the poet and philosopher
<br>
Philodemus, who was the teacher of Vergil and, probably, of Horace,
<br>
the greatest poets of Augustan Rome.
<br>
<p>Two years earlier I had published a book, Aristotle on Comedy,
<br>
arguing that the lost second Book of Aristotle's Poetics, on comedy
<br>
and laughter (celebrated in Umberto Eco's novel The Name of the
<br>
Rose), had not actually perished entirely, but survived in a summary
<br>
in a medieval manuscript in Paris. So new fragments of Aristotle's
<br>
poetic theory, wherever they might be found, were of the greatest
<br>
interest to me. Hence I went for the first time to the National
<br>
Library in Naples, the home of the papyri preserved by the eruption
<br>
of Vesuvius, to restudy this text. Fragile, brittle, black as coal,
<br>
it was the hardest thing which I had ever tried to read. But my
<br>
excitement was great as I managed, using a microscope, to read more
<br>
of the text and thus to confirm the Italian scholar's theory.
<br>
<p>While I was there, I looked at a few other manuscripts in the
<br>
collection. Many were very extensive indeed-and completely
<br>
unpublished. Looking at one which was full of quotations of Greek
<br>
poetry, I said to one of the local scholars that he ought to publish
<br>
it. He said he was too busy with other papyri, and I had to confess
<br>
that I was also. But this made me aware of how much remains to be
<br>
done, even in the absence of finds of more texts from resumed
<br>
excavations at Herculaneum.
<br>
<p>This is the only scholarly library from Greek and Roman antiquity to
<br>
have been preserved in conditions which ensured its physical
<br>
survival. Other ancient texts, like Aristotle's Poetics, survive
<br>
because they were copied and recopied by monks; but not these. They
<br>
are unique in every sense, and do much to bridge the gulf in ancient
<br>
philosophical writing between the time of Aristotle and that of
<br>
Cicero. Philodemus' On Poems, in particular, opens a window onto a
<br>
lost age of scholarship-the period between Aristotle's Poetics and
<br>
Horace's Art of Poetry, the works which define classicism for the
<br>
ancient and modern worlds. I felt that it was time for the On Poems
<br>
to be restored to the world in as complete a state as possible.
<br>
<p>New techniques for reading the papyri-better microscopes, better
<br>
photographs, digital enhancement, infra-red images-came along at
<br>
just the right time. In France and America, two scholars had
<br>
independently rediscovered the key to putting the mutilated
<br>
fragments back into the correct order. The work remained laborious
<br>
and terribly difficult; but it was now possible. As I prepared the
<br>
first volume in Oxford's new series, which aims to edit all the
<br>
aesthetic treatises of Philodemus, the team of scholars whom I
<br>
brought together to undertake this exciting task made other
<br>
discoveries which all contribute to our ability to reconstruct this
<br>
lost library, and with it to understand one of the richest periods
<br>
in the history of human thought.
