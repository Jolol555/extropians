<em>&gt; The opinion-movers would flee the major cities, after which it would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never be in their interest to have their country surrender.
</em><br>
<p>Obviously, following Trotsky, you'd have to kill them FIRST.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Publicly, the first attempt at blackmail, much less the first 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explosion, would be met with outrage and vows to die before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrendering.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on how well you negotiated with their enemies.
<br>
<p>If you've vowed to blow up America in defense of Alla to the Arabs, and 
<br>
in defense of the Empire to the Japanese, etc., you could go a long way.
<br>
<p>While Americans are bull-headed, it's unclear how they'd respond to a 
<br>
genuine nuclear threat by a foe that obviously will use them and has 
<br>
nothing to lose.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Neither the public nor the aristocracy is likely to countenance 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surrender no matter how many cities die.
</em><br>
<p>I think you overestimate human will - cowardice drives civilization - 
<br>
we organize and let the stronger people lead IN ORDER to save our own 
<br>
skins from them.  Witness feudal lordships.
<br>
<p>with the US federal government gone, there'd quickly be local 
<br>
organizations (state troopers, etc.) that would attempt to maintain 
<br>
order, but with the looming threat of nuclear holocaust, how many 
<br>
people would really, say, continue to follow Gray Davis?
<br>
<p>Now, if the TEAM we willing to nuke Los Angeles, San Francisco, 
<br>
Sacramento and San Jose, it probably wouldn't matter much WHAT Gray 
<br>
Davis did, would it?
<br>
<p>The remnants would then be in the position of deciding whether to 
<br>
surrender or to fight back against this unassailable opponent.  Sure 
<br>
it'd be a long slow process, but as I said, if you're willing to risk 
<br>
nuclear holocaust and your opponent isn't, you'll win in the stare-down.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Countries may surrender to invading armies, but not small clever bands 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of blackmailers - it just doesn't trigger our submission reflex.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think the visceral emotional reaction to this scenario would be very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simple; crush the little upstart rodents no matter the cost.  There 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are no nuclear weapons in the ancestral environment.
</em><br>
<p>I guess it would depend on what the upstarts consider victory - if 
<br>
eliminating the governments of the world-superpowers  and being the 
<br>
remaining superpower would be sufficient, I think THAT much could be 
<br>
accomplished.
<br>
<p>The rest would be a question of recruiting - could you get the Chinese 
<br>
Hordes to overrun the Russians in exchange for your nuclear backing?   
<br>
Maybe, maybe not.
<br>
<p>Could you get the Pakistanis to overrun India - absolutely.
<br>
<p>could you get the Serbs to overrun middle-europe?  Probably.
<br>
<p>Could you get another Russian Revolution with nuclear backing, probably.
<br>
<p>I think the only troublesome countries would be the US and China, 
<br>
themselves already being run by &quot;the right 10 people&quot;.
<br>
<p>The question would be whether or not you could hit them effectively.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
