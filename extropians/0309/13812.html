(Please note that the nation/culture thread is actually rather unrelated

to Brin's real point, which is practical politics)

<p>Sure, but that does not change the basic idea. Libertarian theory says 
<br>
one should be peaceful and not initiate coercion, but it is still OK to 
<br>
defend oneself. Furthermore, systems of delegated defensive coercion 
<br>
(neighbourhood associations, PPL firms or police forces) are acceptable 
<br>
- within certain limits. Here things become applied and complex, and one 
<br>
can spend forever analysing the best approach, various more or less 
<br>
likely what-ifs and how to implement it - it has already been done on 
<br>
this list and elsewhere. Other extensions and refinements of the theory 
<br>
apply to cases of lack of information, deranged people, prepersons and 
<br>
so on. Again a lot of complicated judgements but a fairly clear core 
<br>
principle that now interacts with various other principles.
<br>
<p>How OK it is to intervene coercively to save another person from
<br>
coercion or violence is in this complex area, but my understanding
<br>
(interpretation?) of the (a?) libertarian position would be that it is
<br>
usually OK, although it does not have to be a moral obligation. This is
<br>
based on the natural rights perspective. In order to save a human from
<br>
an unjust violation of her right to live it is OK to coerce her
<br>
violators (but avoid unnecessary violence; the case for whether they may
<br>
be killed in the pursuit of human rights is very iffy). This is of
<br>
course based on the universalist view that a certain hierarchy of rights
<br>
really do apply to all people no matter who, when or where they are and 
<br>
that even socially agreed on laws about sex can not void the right to 
<br>
life. 
<br>
<p>We should let others do their thing, but there are things that merit 
<br>
intervention. But one should not see intervention as the default case, 
<br>
but rather as a very extreme special case. We often go on far too much 
<br>
about all the injustices and problems of the world to look at the vast 
<br>
fields of positive results that we already have and how to extend them 
<br>
more efficiently.
