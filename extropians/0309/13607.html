<em>&gt; &gt; Thank you for pointing out my mistake, Steve. I had thought that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amara, I would *not* be so fast to back off on this.  There has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been a recent PBS special in the U.S. running on Luther I think.
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue of priests and marriage suggests the restriction that priests

</em><br>
<em>&gt; had primarily to do with having priests leave their wealth to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; church rather than their heirs.  Pure self-interest at work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The consequence, in part, being the current molestation scandals.
</em><br>
<p>Umm, I'm afraid I'll have to stand my ground here. The programme you mention
<br>
was basically giving the modern 'liberal protestant' view of Luther and the
<br>
reformers as critical opponents of dogma and superstition. Total rubbish I'm
<br>
afraid. Luther, Calvin et al all thought that the Catholic Church had become
<br>
infected by pagan corruptions (such as philosophy) partly through relying
<br>
too much on human reason and the answer was to go back to the original
<br>
pristine tradition of the early church and junk all that scholasticism in
<br>
favour of faith. It's well known that clerical celibacy is not scriptural -
<br>
it was started in the 12th century by Gregory VII for the kind of secular
<br>
reasons you mention, which is why it isn't a dogma (i.e. something you have
<br>
to believe on pain of anathema)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, why the reformation may have promoted individual self-interpretation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the text of the Bible -- it seems to have given way to
</em><br>
&quot;fundamentalism&quot;.
<br>
<em>&gt; I am not sure when and why this took place.  I suspect it has something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to do with the power of leaders to convince people to interpret things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a specific way.  Spike has pointed out to me several times that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Bible can probably be used to justify almost anything.  I suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the same is true of the Koran.
</em><br>
<p>The Reformers argue that the Bible is the ultimate authority (rather than
<br>
the Pope or tradition). Their problem of course is to determine which
<br>
reading is correct but only a few wild eyed radicals wanted each individual
<br>
to be able to interpret it as they saw fit. The general answer is that the
<br>
'magistrate' (the civil power) had to decide what it was, on the advice of
<br>
'the learned and godly' and woe betide anyone who tried to insist on their
<br>
own view. That's why John Locke kept his heterodox religious views to
<br>
himself - he'd have ended up imrpisoned or dead at the hands his Protestant
<br>
fellow Englishmen if he'd been too open. The idea that each beliver can
<br>
interpret scripture as they chose really only gets going after the later
<br>
eighteenth century. A critical thing is what I mentioned, the 'higher
<br>
criticism' started by German scholars, which unravelled the traditional
<br>
understanding of the date and authorship of the scriptures. Before then
<br>
virtually all Christians believed in the inerrancy of scripture (though they
<br>
weren't literalists). Fundamentalism in both Chritianity and Islam is a
<br>
response by (some) believers to the challenge of modern science and critical
<br>
analysis of holy texts. The problem with Islam is it has never really been
<br>
exposed to the 'higher criticism', the overwhelming majority of Muslims are
<br>
scriptural literalists who believe that the text of the Koran is eternal.
<br>
They have the same problem as the Reformers, made worse by the fact that
<br>
there's no 'church' as such. Their answer is exactly the same, that the
<br>
civil power should enforce a particular interpretation (just like in
<br>
Calvin's Geneva).
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So the problem is *not* a 'reformation' per se but the fact that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people abuse the 'reformation' process to convince people to interpret
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the text in a certain specific way -- rather than allow people to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpret it in their own way.  Such behavior is a power grab and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is rooted in basic survival instincts.  One can see this between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; both the people who have religious power in Iran and the young
</em><br>
<em>&gt; college students there as well as the old and young shiites in Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>This is true, but I think it's the inevitable outcome of a process that
<br>
calls on a body of believers to reject the historic, partly reason based
<br>
intellectual tradition of their faith in favour of a return to a
<br>
(fantastical) pure original state, on the basis of one text.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Friedman has an interesting observation with respect to &quot;tribes&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the NY Times today [1]...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; { Technology, though, still can't trump two huge impedients to Arab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy. One is the lack of institutions to ensure a peaceful rotation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of power. &quot;In too many countries there is still a tradition of rule or die
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - either my group or tribe is in power or it's exposed to great danger, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you must never give up power,&quot; noted Michael Mandelbaum, author of &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ideas That Conquered the World.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>True but why is this so? I think the key factor is the familial structure of
<br>
the Arab world, above all the fact that the huge majority of marriages are
<br>
to first cousins. This means a society where you belong to one of a number
<br>
of very large extended kin groups. Broadly speaking you trust your relatives
<br>
and treat them well bu don't trust anyone else. This makes it very difficult
<br>
to sustain modern bureaucratic forms of administration in either the public
<br>
or private sector. Government is basically a system whereby one extended kin
<br>
group screws everyone else. They know that if they lose out, they're toast.
<br>
The key factor is 'asibiya', which means something like 'group
<br>
loyalty/solidarity/team spirit', if you don't have that you're knackered.
<br>
It's worth looking at a map of the world showing the degree to which
<br>
marriages in countries are consanguineous, you'll see some very interesting
<br>
correlations. I think this family structure also explains the proclivity of
<br>
people in certain parts of the world to suicide based
<br>
terrorism/assassination. It isn't so much the lure of paradise as the
<br>
knowledge that you're bringing honour and status to your family, which
<br>
you've been told from birth you must subordinate and sacrifice youself for.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The other is that so many Arab economies are dominated by state oil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revenues and state companies, with private enterprise very weak.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Therefore, holding onto or being close to power are the only pathways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wealth. Control power, control wealth. &quot;It will be very hard to install
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lasting democracy in this region,&quot; Mr. Mandelbaum added, &quot;without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; institutions and economic reforms that guarantee that there is life after
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power and wealth without power.&quot; }
</em><br>
<p>This is clearly true but not enough by itself imo.
<br>
