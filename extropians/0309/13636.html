<p>
I was quite happy to solve (at least temporarily) my individual spam
<br>
problem, and I wanted to share it in case it is useful to anyone (the
<br>
solution works for Unix/Linux and Windows 95 and up).
<br>
<p>I use Linux as my main OS, and my first try was with Vipul Razor
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://razor.sourceforge.net/">http://razor.sourceforge.net/</a>&gt;. Nice, but it only caught a modest
<br>
fraction of the spam. I then switched to a Perl solution that goes by
<br>
the silly name of SpamAssassin (now on SA) &lt;<a href="http://www.spamassassin.org/">http://www.spamassassin.org/</a>&gt;,
<br>
wich turned out to be awesome.
<br>
<p>SA uses both text analysis based on a large number of rules, and
<br>
online checks (including Vipul Razor if you like). Online checks can
<br>
be disabled, which is much faster and almost as useful. In many months
<br>
of use, I only had one mailing list producing false positives (French
<br>
folks sending HTML-only messages with typically spam-like formatting).
<br>
<p>Then, very recently, I had a few SERIOUS false positives. I was quite
<br>
worried, but then discovered the reason: a black list had stopped
<br>
working (as mentionned by someone else here) AND RETURNED POSITIVE TO
<br>
EVERY CHECK. To avoid this, just get a recent version of SA, or see &lt;<a href="http://news.spamassassin.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=44&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0">http://news.spamassassin.org/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=44&amp;mode=thread&amp;order=0&amp;thold=0</a><br>
<p>SA is a collection of Perl modules distributed under Perl's Artistic
<br>
license, so it can easily be ported to other platforms. I was asked an
<br>
anti-spam solution by a friend using Windows, and I found a nice
<br>
Windows port of SA (implemented as a local POP3 proxy server). It is
<br>
very easy to install and as effective as the original. It works with
<br>
any email client.
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://saproxy.bloomba.com/docs/faq.html">http://saproxy.bloomba.com/docs/faq.html</a>&gt; (read first entry for download)
<br>
<p>Of course, you will still download the spam -- unless you have access
<br>
to procmail (Unix) at your web service provider. I don't; I have a
<br>
fetchmail + local procmail setup. The relevant part of my .procmailrc is
<br>
<p># spamassassin
<br>
:0fw
<br>
| /usr/bin/spamassassin
<br>
:0:
<br>
* ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
<br>
spam-assassin.spool
<br>
<p>Windows users don't need to do anything like that. (They just need to
<br>
ask at install time that the proxy POP server be started at boot time.)
