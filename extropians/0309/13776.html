I am right at my &quot;ideal&quot; body weight, but I expect to put on a few pounds
<br>
while I adjust to being a non-smoker. I'm also only 5'3&quot; so I am a good
<br>
candidate for a Mars mission :-)
<br>
Until recently I had been of the opinion that cancer cause smoking, not the
<br>
other way around. I figured that a few mutated DNA sequences were
<br>
responsible for cancer, and addiction. (Have you ever met an alcoholic
<br>
non-smoker?)
<br>
Anyways, I was living based on a hypothesis that I had created without
<br>
adequate knowledge that could justify smoking. Just like any other junky.
<br>
Now I know it was the nicotine talking.
<br>
<p>With my diet, I love pizza, McDonald's, and any other fast-food. I rarely
<br>
eat &quot;normal&quot; meals. I used to eat 3 peanut butter sandwiches per day. Yet my
<br>
body weight has never been below or above average. I have maintained the
<br>
same 135-140 pounds for the ;ast 15 years. I am inexcusably healthy. I am
<br>
sick no more than pnce per year and I fight it off quickly. I have a few
<br>
allergies, but not many. Everyone in my family smokes. My great-grandmother
<br>
died at 96 a few years ago. My grandparents are all deceased, but 2 died
<br>
from alcoholism, one an accident, one complications from radiation exposure
<br>
in WW2 in Nagasaki.
<br>
<p>But i don;t want to take the chances any further than I need to. Thanks for
<br>
your help!
