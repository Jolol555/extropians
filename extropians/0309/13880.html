<p>Actually, neither.  As I recall, I was working at Yourdon, Inc. in
<br>
the early 1980's when an individual, who if I recall correctly was
<br>
named Mark Pearson, developed the first spreadsheet application I
<br>
ever saw.  [I don't recall the name of the program.]  Of course it
<br>
was rather cumbersome since windows did not exist so one was running
<br>
it on standard 23x80 terminals.  I think subsequently VisiCalc became
<br>
the first well known spreadsheet application.  Then came Lotus 123
<br>
followed by Excel.  Can't google come up with something on the
<br>
&quot;history of spreedsheets&quot;?
<br>
<p>Also, on a related topic -- Java was not designed by Bill Joy, it
<br>
was designed by James Gosling [1].
