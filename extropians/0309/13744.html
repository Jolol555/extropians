<p>Let's hope so.  It certainly seems to be loosening up.  I'm not prepared
<br>
to get into a discussion of Chinese politics and history, but it seems
<br>
like Chinese Communism is slowly evolving into something much more free
<br>
and open.  There might be setbacks and it might take a while, but it
<br>
appears China either won't go through the kind of revolution that
<br>
happened in Eastern Europe or that it hasn't reached the critical point
<br>
where a revolution can take place.  Perhaps Greg has some insight into
<br>
this???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I hope the Chinese are successful.  It is

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't know about inevitability.  The US space industry from the 1950s
<br>
to today is heavily subsidized and regulated.  (The non-US space
<br>
industries are likewise heavily subsidized and regulated.)  This leads
<br>
to all kinds of economic inefficiencies and roads not taken.
<br>
<p>The problem with lunar commercialization is getting over the initial
<br>
costs.  I think the Moon would be a money maker for tourism at least,
<br>
but we need the infrastructure to get there.  Of course, this could be
<br>
said about a lot of projects, but in this case, it seems obvious that
<br>
government intervention has driven up launch costs.  Since we can't
<br>
really go back in time and correct this, we have to focus on the future.
<br>
One thing we should try to do is get the space industry to stop being a
<br>
giant welfare program.
<br>
<p>Cheers!
<br>
