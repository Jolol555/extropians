<p><p>The point being that the investors may have limited their liability

PHYSICALLY by being completely detached from the mission, but I'll bet

whoever the ships were sent to exploit wouldn't see it that way if they

got them in a room alone.
<br>
<p>Once again, the point being that the Moral Liability for desecrating 
<br>
someone's homeland, for instance, should not be disclaim-able simply 
<br>
because someone ELSE writes their contracts that way.  And in fact, by 
<br>
nature, they are not disclaim-able.  Only when backed by FORCE or 
<br>
DECEPTION can liability be avoided.  If the natives who's homelands are 
<br>
desecrated by the ships funded by the LLC's members find out who the 
<br>
members are, their outrage can only be blocked by 
<br>
force/deception/coercion.
