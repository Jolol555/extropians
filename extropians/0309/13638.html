Hmmm... looks to me like I was right about the PA and
<br>
perhaps other laws going completely against the 1st
<br>
ammendment.
<br>
<p>This is derived from:
<br>
<a href="http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=03/09/01/1059213&amp;mode=thread">http://grep.law.harvard.edu/article.pl?sid=03/09/01/1059213&amp;mode=thread</a> <br>
leading to:
<br>
<a href="http://www.raisethefist.com/news.cgi?artical=wire/-----74814smallsherm.gifIMG.article">http://www.raisethefist.com/news.cgi?artical=wire/-----74814smallsherm.gifIMG.article</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;Austin's probation stipulates, among other things, that (1) he cannot
<br>
possess or access a computer of any kind without prior approval of his
<br>
probation officer, (2) if his probation officer gives permission, the
<br>
equipment is subject to monitoring and is subject to search and seizure at
<br>
any time, without notice, (3) he cannot alter any of the software or
<br>
hardware on any computer he uses, (4) he must surrender his phone, DSL,
<br>
electric, and satellite bills, (5) he cannot associate with any person or
<br>
group that seeks to change the government in any way (be that
<br>
environmental, social justice, political, economic, etc.), and (6) he must
<br>
pay over $2,000 in fines and restitution. Austin must surrender himself to
<br>
the Federal Bureau of Prisons by September 3, 2003.&quot;
<br>
<p>Read that carefully -- &quot;cannot associate with any person or group
<br>
that seeks to change the government in any way&quot;!!!
<br>
<p>So he could not attend a rally to elect Arnold S. in CA.
<br>
<p>I'd advise watching things like this very carefully as it looks to
<br>
me as if the government decides to outlaw nanotech or AI
<br>
or body enhancement or cryonics -- then the transhumanist agenda
<br>
is likely to become significantly constrained.  In this particular
<br>
case it is interesting because it looks like one can place blame
<br>
on the executive, legislative *and* judicial branches of the
<br>
government.
