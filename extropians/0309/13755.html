<p><p>Point well taken.  I've never claimed to be among the &quot;right 10 people&quot; 
<br>
so that'd be something for them to decide.
<br>
<p>So, for instance, preemptively and without warning, nuking tokyo, los 
<br>
angeles, new york, san francisco, chicago, washington, london, paris, 
<br>
munich, berlin, beijing, (and of course, wherever GW Bush happens to be 
<br>
vacationing at the moment) etc., might be a necessity.  If the Queen of 
<br>
England survives the rubble of London, she wouldn't be able to make a 
<br>
significant move any faster that the TEAM would be.
<br>
<p>I expect that destroying the communication infrastructure for the other 
<br>
political elite would be a primary goal.  In the US, for instance, a 
<br>
major catastrophe in Los Angeles, DC and New York would be enough to 
<br>
really whack the mainstream television/news networks.  If you could 
<br>
time it with the release of a really vicious DDOS-style virus, you'd 
<br>
have blocked information from the political elite to their followers in 
<br>
the US (just as an example) (since the combination of a congested 
<br>
network and failing smtp servers worldwide would effectively put the 
<br>
internet QUA means of military organization out of business).  That 
<br>
would leave the Military networks isolated from Civilian Networks.
<br>
<p>If the military were simultaneously over-committed (like the current US 
<br>
military) the military would be unable to effectively respond without 
<br>
their political leadership, leaving it up to the FBI/CIA to deal with 
<br>
the threat.  You could expect half the CIA to join you if you offered 
<br>
them the right kind of incentives :) (since most of them are working 
<br>
for two side as it is...)
<br>
<p>In (most) other countries, the communication infrastructure doesn't 
<br>
exist at the level it does here, so toppling the government isn't as 
<br>
big a deal.  In Hungary, for instance, I think most of the people 
<br>
wouldn't care if you toppled their government as long as you didn't 
<br>
replace it with something really egregious.
<br>
<p>Okay, this has been fun, but I admit it, I'm no world-conqueror and not 
<br>
even interested in doing it.
<br>
<p>I am interested in the future possibility of it by some 
<br>
hyper-technologically advanced coup, though, make a good novel.
