<em>&gt; I agree that limited liability should be abolished.
</em><br>
<p>### Why? Don't forget that tort liability (and this is the liability we are
<br>
talking about) is a almost always a function of the state court system, so
<br>
its limitations/extensions are not a matter of physical law, but malleable
<br>
convention, to a larger extent than e.g. contract law, which has a more
<br>
direct recourse to game theory, and reciprocity-based moral intuitions.
<br>
<p>I see no reason why limited liability should be prohibited. This legal
<br>
convention allowed some increases in investment, especially for poor people.
<br>
Tort liability in this context can be satisfied by liability insurance
<br>
carried by the LLC. The assessment of risk performed by professional
<br>
adjusters for the insurance providers would determine the premiums, which
<br>
directly translate into increased stock prices of dangerous companies, and
<br>
provides incentives for limiting liability exposure (by e.g. adopting safer
<br>
business practices).
<br>
<p>Without limited liability, stock owners would assume unlimited liability,
<br>
and only the professionals or the foolhardy can do that repeatedly.
<br>
Alternatively, only stocks carrying sufficient liability insurance would be
<br>
widely traded, but this would not differ from an LLC with insurance in
<br>
anything but name.
<br>
<p>Abolishing LLC would change little in the economy, except for some names,
<br>
decreased reliance on stock for funding, increases in reliance on credit,
<br>
and maybe increased use of commercial insurance by businesses. The
<br>
non-professional investor would lose, and consumers would not gain.
