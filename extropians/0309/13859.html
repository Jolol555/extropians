<p><em>&gt;&gt; Poverty is NOT less than 20% - even in the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;poverty&quot; is, of course, relative.  Define what you mean by it.  As of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1992, per this study, the global figure was at 24%, defined as $1 US
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dollar per day.
</em><br>
<p>A dollar a day is a lot in some places.
<br>
<p>let's define poverty as:
<br>
<p>Inability to afford simultaneously health care, food and shelter.
<br>
<p>According to the UN report (which I take to be a relatively biased  
<br>
report, requiring the consent of the 5 most powerful nations in the  
<br>
world....)
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/action/actionindex.htm">http://www.globalpolicy.org/globaliz/action/actionindex.htm</a>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as well as excerpted here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.richmonddiocese.org/ojp/ojp121.htm">http://www.richmonddiocese.org/ojp/ojp121.htm</a>
<br>
<p>In the 1990's, the number of people surviving on less than $1/day was  
<br>
halved IN EAST ASIA (my emphasis).
<br>
<p>Still, human development is proceeding too slowly, for many countries,  
<br>
the 1990's were a decade of despair.  Some 54 (out of 125 &quot;developing&quot;  
<br>
countries) are poorer now than in 1990.  In 21 a larger proportion of  
<br>
people is going hungry.  In 14, more children are dying before age 5.   
<br>
In 12, primary school enrollments are shrinking (notably India).  In  
<br>
34, life expectancy has fallen.  SUCH REVERSALS IN SURVIVAL WERE  
<br>
PREVIOUSLY RARE (my emphasis).
<br>
<p>But in Latin America and the  Caribbean, the Arab States, Central and  
<br>
Eastern Europe and sub-Saharan Africa  the number of people living on  
<br>
less than $1 a day increased. Moreover, at the  current pace,  
<br>
sub-Saharan Africa would not reach the target for poverty  reduction  
<br>
until 2147 and for child mortality until 2165. And both HIV/AIDS and   
<br>
hunger in Africa are heading up -- not down.
<br>
<p>The  report notes that in the 1990s average per-capita income growth  
<br>
was less than 3%  in 125 developing  countries.  In 54 of these  
<br>
nations, average per-capita  income fell -- 20 in sub-Saharan Africa,  
<br>
17 in Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent States, 6  in  
<br>
Latin America  &amp; the Caribbean, 6 in East Asia &amp; the Pacific, and 5 in  
<br>
the Arab States.
<br>
<p>Why?
<br>
<p>One common reason is poor governance. When  governments are corrupt,  
<br>
incompetent or unaccountable to their citizens,  national economies  
<br>
falter.
<br>
<p>Now, if you were the president of Burma and Nike were to offer you and  
<br>
your sweat-shop owning buddies a coupla million to put down revolts.   
<br>
AND if the US government were selling you weapons at discounted rates,  
<br>
you might just do it.
<br>
<p><p><p><em>&gt;&gt; So are you just ignorant of the political repression in Burma that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; causes them to be subject to abject poverty and willing to take shitty
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; jobs?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Burma?  From the CIA world fact book
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bm.html">http://www.cia.gov/cia/publications/factbook/geos/bm.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>Granted and affirmed, the Burmese government SUCKS.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know little of Burma, but this seems typical of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppressive closed societies, do you have knowledge suggesting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poverty in burma is FROM the multinational conglomerates?
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://www.csun.edu/CommunicationStudies/ben/news/961120.disney.html">http://www.csun.edu/CommunicationStudies/ben/news/961120.disney.html</a>
<br>
<p>For instance, there's loads of this stuff.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Population below poverty line = 25%
</em><br>
<p>Again, depending on how you define poverty.  There are people who live  
<br>
in the United States on $20k/year that I think are poor by the standard  
<br>
above - can they simultaneously afford  (adequate)  health-care,   
<br>
food/water and shelter?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No doubt the perpetuation of poverty is a complex issue, but lets not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forget that at the very least before agriculture and civilization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *everyone* was below poverty level,
</em><br>
<p>So things have been better for only 8000 years.  Hmmm.
<br>
<p>I look at it this way.  In every generation and in every time, there  
<br>
have been slaves and masters, genocides and wars justified by economic  
<br>
expansion and &quot;progress&quot;.  Today is not different.  We just hide the  
<br>
word slavery under &quot;obscenely poor&quot;.  As I told Rafal, if it REALLY  
<br>
makes you feel better to turn someone from a slave to a share-cropper  
<br>
fine, but that just means you don't understand the plight of the  
<br>
share-cropper.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have read suggestions that at one point some 10's of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of years ago the entire adult breeding population was as low
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as 1,000 people.
</em><br>
<p><p>Surely during the plague years, people dropped like flies.  Today's  
<br>
plagues are AIDS, Heart Disease and Cancer.  I gave references to the  
<br>
CDC before in this thread.  People are still dropping like flies - Ma  
<br>
nish tanah, ha lailah hazeh, mikohl ha-ley-lot.  But &quot;since  
<br>
civilization&quot; there've always been increases in raw numbers of people  
<br>
as far as I know.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Robbie
