<p>To a limited extent -- we know that certain pollutants can cause
<br>
mutations (this has been worked out extensively by Bruce Ames).
<br>
But this can include both pollutants *and* natural substances.
<br>
What we don't know is the effect of dose-response relationships.
<br>
There is reasonable evidence that exposure to low levels of stresses
<br>
or toxic substances might actually up-regulate cell defenses and
<br>
decrease the chances of getting cancer.  This process is known as
<br>
hormesis.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We don't KNOW that age does.
</em><br>
<p>Ca-ca.  Cancer rates go up with age whether one lived in Roman
<br>
times or the 20th century.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Although it seems tautological - if increased exposure to pollutants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes cancer, then the longer you are exposed to them, the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely you are to get cancer, hence the older you are, the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely you are, etc.
</em><br>
<p>No argument -- except for the hormesis effect I point out above.
<br>
This is very variable in the human population -- consider humans
<br>
living in a cave (for generations) with high radon levels vs. humans in
<br>
a cave with low radon levels.  It would have been very difficult for evolution
<br>
to do a complete population optimization for exposure to variable levels
<br>
of ionizing radiation (radon is radioactive and decays producing radiation
<br>
that is potentially a major source of lung cancer).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While the conjecture is an important one, it doesn't make it more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a contributing factor - GIVEN that we KNOW that increased stress,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollutants, alcohol, tobacco, smog, heavy-metals, food-poisons, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are cancer-causing.
</em><br>
<p>Stress causes cancer because it down-regulates the response of the
<br>
immune system (see Sapolsky's work).  This is a general misprogramming
<br>
of the genome and the shift we have had from a hunter-gatherer societies
<br>
to modern societies (which do provide certain benefits like antibiotics).
<br>
<p>Pollutants is kind of a genaral term -- certainly some alter gene regulation
<br>
pathways in very subtle ways -- such as pollutants that resemble natural
<br>
hormones (which seem to be involved in serious consequences to the development
<br>
of certain fish and amphibians).  Other pollutants may be completely harmless.
<br>
<p>Tobacco and smog are complex problems because they are not specific substances.
<br>
Again types of molecules may be harmful but others may be non-harmful or
<br>
even beneficial.
<br>
<p>Heavy metals can disrupt normal genetic regulatory pathways or the function
<br>
of normal protein functions (as was recently determined for cadmium).
<br>
They may or may not cause cancer.  Iron and copper can hardly be considered
<br>
&quot;heavy&quot; metals but both are ions that if not properly managed can generate
<br>
free radicals that *will* damage DNA and lead to cancer.  They are also
<br>
essential nutrients -- if not consumed in sufficient quantities one is
<br>
highly likely to suffer a premature death.  Ha -- you can beat cancer
<br>
by reducing your iron and copper intake -- that way you die before you
<br>
get a chance to develop cancer.
<br>
<p>Certain &quot;food-poisons&quot;, such as Sulforaphane in Broccoli actually have
<br>
anti-cancer properties by up-regulating the better pathways of detoxification
<br>
in ones liver.
<br>
<p>Bottom line (IMO): a big chunk of aging is due to the misrepair of DNA
<br>
double strand breaks corrupting the genetic code.  The longer you are around
<br>
the more corrupted the code becomes.  Result: increased rates of cancer
<br>
and the more general phenomena known as &quot;aging&quot;.
<br>
<p>This fits in well with oxidative stress, management of cellular glucose
<br>
levels (the whole glycemic index thingy), caloric restriction, increases
<br>
in mutagenic substances in the environment damaging DNA, exposure to higher
<br>
radiation levels (homes with higher radon levels), etc.
<br>
<p>Bottom line -- one isn't going to correct the problem until one has robust
<br>
bionanotechnology or nanotechnology to correct the repair pathways that
<br>
cause the corruption of the genetic code.  The best you may be able to do
<br>
in the meantime is retard those processes that contribute to the mutations
<br>
and/or double strand breaks.
<br>
