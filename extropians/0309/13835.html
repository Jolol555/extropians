<p>
This reminds me, though I have no concrete plans to reproduce, I keep 
<br>
thinking about what I would do if it fell to me to teach survival skills 
<br>
to a fledgling.
<br>
<p>I think I'd make allowance merit- and negotiation-based. Examples:
<br>
<p>1) &quot;Applicant Initiated Grant Proposal&quot;
<br>
You want a talking Poke-Tubby? Tell you what, do a search on the 
<br>
internet on where I can buy you one, and write me a short paragraph 
<br>
saying why you think this Poke-Tubby will be more fun for you than other 
<br>
toys I could buy you for the same price, or other toys I've bought you 
<br>
in the past. Extra points for coming up with clever arguments.
<br>
<p>2) &quot;Call for Proposals&quot;
<br>
There was an old guy named Robert Heinlein who wrote some interesting 
<br>
books for kids your age. If you write me a one-page book report or do a 
<br>
five-minute 'seminar' on one of his books, there will be XX 
<br>
yen/egolds/whatever-we'll-be-using-for-money-by-then in it for you, if 
<br>
it's as good as or better than the Isaac Asimov report you did last week.
<br>
<p>3) &quot;Matching Funds&quot;
<br>
Here's XX rands/neo-rubles/whatever for you (thanks for defragging the 
<br>
family PC). It's yours to spend as you like, but for every 
<br>
rand/neo-ruble you put into saving up for that glow-in-the-dark hamster 
<br>
you wanted, I'll add a rand/neo-ruble of my own.
<br>
<p>That way, real life won't take them by surprise... they'll have already 
<br>
developed intuitions for how to go about getting what they want (rather 
<br>
than just 'gimme!').
<br>
<p>Also, people, kids especially, are visual/tactile learners. How much 
<br>
easier it would have been for me to understand valence interactions of 
<br>
the common atoms if I had a molecular model kit to play with when I was 
<br>
a kid. Same complexity level as a tinker-toy, but communicates 
<br>
supposedly high school level concepts. Likewise, visible man/woman, 
<br>
microscopes, telescopes, bread-boards for circuitry... can anybody think 
<br>
of good toys for developing intuitions for calculus, evolution, algorithms?
<br>
