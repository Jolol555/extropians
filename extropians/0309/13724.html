</em><br>
<p>There are more, and bigger, problems.  &quot;Rebuild the Saturn V&quot; 
<br>
comes up regularly on sci.space.* -- there are arguments
<br>
against it.
<br>
<p>Firstly, there's the customization issue (as noted earlier in
<br>
this thread). Bluntly, the blueprints don't reflect the final
<br>
stacks that flew -- at least, not perfectly.
<br>
<p>Then there's instrumentation. Almost all the avionics are long
<br>
obsolete to such an extent that they'd have to be redesigned
<br>
from scratch.
<br>
<p>Then there's the pad. Pad 39A was _special_, and so was the
<br>
VAB and the crawlers, and they have all been repurposed for
<br>
Shuttle ops.  You couldn't convert them back for Saturn V ops
<br>
without retiring STS (a bit of a gotcha in the current
<br>
climate), and building new ground facilities at a cost of
<br>
several gigabucks (the VAB was the world's largest single
<br>
room building when it was built, the crawler was the largest
<br>
non-railroad ground vehicle, and when they built a second
<br>
shuttle pad at Vandenburg AFB in the 80's it cost a few
<br>
billion for all the kilotons of concrete and hundreds of
<br>
kilometres of pipework).
<br>
<p>Then there's the jigs for assembling the plumbing. Maybe
<br>
setting up to manufacture F1 and J2 engines wouldn't be too
<br>
hard, but those were _big_ cylinders and nobody kept the
<br>
assembly jigs. It's not impractical to build new tankage
<br>
production from scratch, but it's still a large job.
<br>
<p>There are other problems. All the measurements and parameters
<br>
are pre-metric, some of the materials aren't available any
<br>
more, and so on. But those are trivial compared to the big
<br>
roadblocks like the lack of ground facilities and avionics.
<br>
<p>Various folks have run the figures, and by the time they get
<br>
through with them they calculate that re-starting Saturn V
<br>
production would cost as much as taking Shuttle tech and
<br>
building an unmanned Big Dumb Booster with a 100 ton 
<br>
payload to LEO, and would probably cost more per flight.
<br>
<p>The real scandal is that BDB and Energiya aren't flying.
<br>
Because the kit to build them and the knowledge base to make
<br>
it work is a lot more recent than Saturn V.
<br>
<p>(I will happily agree that cancelling Saturn production in
<br>
1966 was an amazingly stupid and short-sighted move and that 
<br>
an ongoing Saturn program made a lot more sense than Shuttle. 
<br>
But now we're here, the question &quot;where do we go tomorrow?&quot; 
<br>
isn't answered by resurrecting a forty-year-old design.)
<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a Saturn V fly with his own eyes)
