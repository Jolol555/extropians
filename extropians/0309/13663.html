<p>Absolutely, I think I was simplifying. But whether its Joe person, 
<br>
Joe the group or corporate or Joe the country the concerns are
<br>
still the same.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It only works if you assume that such AIs are the result of

<p>I won't repeat all my comment in my reply to Robert, but this is in
<br>
fact largely my point. There will probably be a range of AI's and
<br>
their will be a bit of a technological arms race once the notion that
<br>
AI's are producable and can give economic advantage to their
<br>
holders catches on.  Where in all this does the friendly bit of AI 
<br>
get to emerge that is genuinely universally friendly? Seems to me
<br>
it quite possibly doesn't. Universal friendliness is not something 
<br>
that the AI developers get a premium for &quot;growing from a seed&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Maybe one could make an analysis looking at different &quot;Gini
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coefficients&quot; of AI intelligence distribution. 
</em><br>
<p>Sorry. Must plead ignorance to &quot;gini coefficients&quot; but some risk
<br>
analysis sounds real healthy 'cause if it turns out that by running 
<br>
some fairly easy game theory notions that the first AI's are going
<br>
to face a backlash because they are not human and can't be
<br>
agents or treated as persons (where would society draw the
<br>
line?) then we may do well to look at the consequences for this
<br>
on any singularity take off time.
