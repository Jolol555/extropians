<p>Unless you have concrete knowledge with regard to the genetics of your
<br>
variants with respect to DNA repair and toxic substance disposal genes
<br>
this is *not* a good strategy [i.e. assuming that technology will save
<br>
you] (at least with respect to smoking).  I strongly suspect genetic knowledge
<br>
is also essential for dealing with diet -- just this week they reported that
<br>
people who tended to be overweight produced less of one of the hormonal signals
<br>
in the intestine that indicated that one was &quot;full&quot;.  So both damage caused
<br>
by smoking and obesity management have very strong genetic components.
<br>
Best strategy is to assume you have a bad set of genes.  Otherwise, its
<br>
like Dirty Harry (Clint Eastwood) said &quot;Well, do you feel lucky?&quot; -- best to
<br>
assume one is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do any of you have any suggestions for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reading material on either of these two items?
</em><br>
<p>I would say that the Walford diet books, the Pritikin books and the Atkins
<br>
books might all be of interest.  The question is whether or not you are
<br>
at your &quot;ideal&quot; weight (assuming that &quot;ideal&quot; is what one typically weighed
<br>
around the end of high school).  [Though that may not be true if one is
<br>
really young and a victim of our current food trends in society.]  The
<br>
CDC recognizes obesity as an epidemic in the current U.S. society and
<br>
other societies are trending that way -- McDonald's (and others) are
<br>
&quot;global&quot; companies.  Greg Burch reported several months ago that he
<br>
was having good success with the Atkin's Diet in reducing weight but the
<br>
Walford and Pritikin strategies are reasonable alternatives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My first assumption has been to quit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drinking milk entirely since the ability to digest it is a mutation that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only affects a minority of us. I've always had trouble with it, so I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only assume that it's not right for me. But where else do I go from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there?
</em><br>
<p>The ability to digest lactose (in cow's milk) is genetic.  One might try
<br>
switching to soy milk to see if that makes a difference.  One doesn't have
<br>
to consume milk in ones diet -- one could substitute a variety of other
<br>
protein sources -- everything from eggs to turkey patties to salmon or tuna.
<br>
Salmon and tuna are helpful because they tend to be high in omega-3 fatty
<br>
acids as well as protein.
<br>
<p>If one wants to go strict vegetarian its a little more difficult --
<br>
I believe one could get a relatively complete protein complex on
<br>
corn + beans (as in a Mexican diet).  In that case one might want
<br>
to supplement on omega-3 fatty acids.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What about quitting smoking? Patches, gum, orange juice, water?
</em><br>
<p>Frozen lemonade mix with lots of ice in the glass.  Or in Seattle its
<br>
clearly coffee/expresso in various combinations.  I got through the
<br>
Univ. of Wash. for several years on double-tall non-fat lattes.
<br>
I've also found things like diet coke or pepsi flavored with Italian
<br>
syrups (cinnamon, hazlenut, etc.) helpful.  The trick is to try and
<br>
keep the tastebuds entertained while keeping the calorie content low
<br>
(esp. with lots of ice).
<br>
<p>In the winter hot apple cider mix where you really throw on the
<br>
spices (cinnamon, nutmeg, etc.) might be helpful.
<br>
<p>But by all means go with patches or gum if necessary.  With respect to
<br>
smoking it is all of the other things (and there are many of them)
<br>
that are produced by smoking and that one exposes lung, oral and
<br>
liver tissue to rather than the nicotine itself that are probably
<br>
most harmful.  (I could give a long lecture on the detoxification of
<br>
substances in smoke but that would probably be overly technical.)
<br>
<p>There are two aspects of smoking -- the &quot;ritual&quot; and the &quot;addiction&quot;
<br>
you can treat them as separate entities and perhaps make the behavioral
<br>
modification process easier.  One can substitute &quot;rituals&quot; and step
<br>
down the &quot;addiction&quot; (so ones brain has time to adapt).  It probably
<br>
takes the brain at least several days to modify neurotransmitter levels
<br>
influenced in various addictions.  So  IMO, one should stage
<br>
withdrawal processes.  Anders or Rafal should feel free to correct
<br>
this if they feel otherwise -- I'm making these comments based on how
<br>
long I believe it takes gene regulatory feedback processes to &quot;kick in&quot;
<br>
in neurons on a large scale basis.
<br>
<p>Good luck,
<br>
Robert
