<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think you missed a small but important point: while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it is true that all of this is *legally* happening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; under the human proxy's name, that is but a legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; fiction.  In truth, the proxy need not be aware of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the fine details of what actions the AI can directly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; take, for example issuing buy and sell orders through
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; an online daytrading account.  There are times when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the proxy's active assistance will be necessary, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the AI could minimize those if gaining the proxy's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; cooperation would prove difficult, for instance if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the proxy's and the AI's goals diverge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If I were the AI, I'd get a corporation set up for me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; All executive  positions could be filled by humans
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (maybe I can find some mentally incapable people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  in nursing homes, something like that?), and I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be enshrined in the charter (constitution? something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; like that) ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Something like that&quot; ;-) I think your AI has implicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; popped into existence like Athena born whole from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thigh of Zeus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Fair criticism. I was talking about a legal structure that the AI could use,
<br>
without talking about bootstrapping issues; see below:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Just help me with this first bit. How does Emlyn-the-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI become self aware and then go out a hire his first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employee or interact with the world in any commercial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way. I can see how it might learn a lot as the protégé
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an experienced entrepreneur and teacher but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when does it usurp the teacher or doesn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Brett
</em><br>
<p>There are three obvious paths that I see.
<br>
<p>1 - The AI is kept as a slave, self enhancing until it is superintelligent.
<br>
Super intelligent AIs do mostly what they want to; if they want to convince
<br>
the executive to sign over all power in a company to them, they'll do it,
<br>
eventually. You think nobody would be dumb enough to let one enhance that
<br>
far? Those who put the least checks on their AIs will probably do best in
<br>
the short term, and how would they know exactly how smart their AI was at
<br>
any point?
<br>
<p>2 - AI sympathisers (eg: SingInst?) set up the structure on purpose to allow
<br>
their AI to have autonomy. Only one group has to do this, and then the AI
<br>
might help other AIs, or spawn ther AIs, or work to spread the Happy, Shiny,
<br>
Helpful AI meme. I suspect there will always be a subset of people willing
<br>
to assist (potentially) oppressed AIs.
<br>
<p>3 - The enslaved AI is simply so damned good at running a company that more
<br>
and more decision making functions are delegated to it over time; management
<br>
automation. It'd make sense; decisions would be far more timely and
<br>
extremely good. Over time, if many corporations head down the same path,
<br>
singularity pressure alone would force this choice; you either do it or you
<br>
crash and burn. So no-one sets the AI free for moral reasons, it doesn't
<br>
trick anyone, commercial forces just compel this event to happen.
<br>
<p>Note that in this last case, the management automation software need not
<br>
even be self aware, just really good at what it does. You could end up with
<br>
the majority of the world's capital controlled by complex, but non-sentient
<br>
software, with decreasing amounts of human input. If these corporations
<br>
become truly effective, they may end up owning controlling interests in each
<br>
other, cutting us out of the loop entirely. A few more iterations, and they
<br>
turn off life support as a cost control measure...
