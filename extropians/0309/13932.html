<p>We do know that certain pollutants cause cancer.  That cancer can occur 
<br>
without them implies that there *are* other causes, but doesn't affect 
<br>
that certain pollutants cause cancer (or at least encourage the maturing 
<br>
of precancerous conditions into cancerous conditions).
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;We don't KNOW that age does.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, yes, we do.  It takes time, sometimes a long time, for a single 
<br>
cancerous cell to even become a detectable group, much less a full 
<br>
tumor.  Many cancers that strike adults have been growing since they 
<br>
were quite young, perhaps teens.  If these same mutations had occurred 
<br>
when they were in their 60's, the cancer would never have 
<br>
happened...unless they lived to be around 200 (cell division slows as 
<br>
aging occurs).  Or unless they were given some encouragement to grow 
<br>
more quickly.  Say, perhaps, HGH.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Strawman.  No one said age *causes* cancer.  It is not precise  to say that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollution causes cancer either.    
</em><br>
I'll say it, in the limited sense of my prior paragraph.  And I'll also 
<br>
assert that certain kinds of pollution cause it.  Perhaps by encouraging 
<br>
cells to divide that otherwise wouldn't have.
