<p>
This is a study which came out a few years ago.  Anyone
<br>
hear of an update?
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.alzheimers.org/nianews/nianews6.html">http://www.alzheimers.org/nianews/nianews6.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;...The ground-breaking study ... found that the complexity of the
<br>
sisters' writings as young women had a great deal to do with how they
<br>
fared cognitively later in life...&quot;
<br>
<p><p>It occurred to me that the extropians archives provides
<br>
the basis for a similar study of the complexity of
<br>
poster's sentence structure in the younger years versus 
<br>
their later development of Alzheimer's disease and other
<br>
cognitive degradation conditions, as noted in the URL cited
<br>
where it was demonstrated that the nuns whose writings showed
<br>
the most complicated and convoluted sentence structure were
<br>
those least likely to develop Alzheimer's disease later in
<br>
life, although we must recognize the possibility that a
<br>
knowledge of the study itself may result in an unconscious 
<br>
tendency or perhaps an intentional effort to communicate with 
<br>
preposterously complex sentence structure, which may in
<br>
fact skew the outcome and result in some extremely pedantic
<br>
sentences which would be nearly impossible to diagram
<br>
because of all the digressions, clauses and other useless
<br>
clutter that is inserted or appended in an attempt to protect 
<br>
oneself from getting Alzheimers disease as well as a reluctance
<br>
to use periods, causing posters to choose instead to end their
<br>
marathon sentences with a comma,
<br>
<p>spike
