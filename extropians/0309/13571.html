<p>I have heard this metaphorical theory before.  I don't believe it is valid.  
<br>
Mormonism is *much* younger than Islam but not at all violent.   Many of the 
<br>
world's religions were much more mellow in their beginning than later on.  
<br>
Besides, can the world afford to have a violent teenager over 1.3 billion 
<br>
strong loose?
