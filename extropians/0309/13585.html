</em><br>
<em>&gt; property rights?
</em><br>
<p>At first, of course, the AI would have to work through
<br>
human agents at some level, if for nothing else than
<br>
to hook it up to things that can affect the real
<br>
world.  The AI's &quot;magic&quot; is not in generating some
<br>
real world influence from nothing, but in leveraging
<br>
even a tiny bit of real world influence.
<br>
<p>Consider, for instance, an AI that could correctly
<br>
guess the next hour's trading on Wall Street with 99+%
<br>
accuracy, with an online daytrading account starting
<br>
at $1,000 as some researcher's experiment.  With the
<br>
resulting string of &quot;good days&quot;, this money would grow
<br>
exponentially, eventually allowing the AI to become
<br>
the majority stockholder in several corporations.
<br>
Granted, the stocks would all be in its host
<br>
researcher's name, but the AI would also presumably be
<br>
familiar enough with said researcher to gain
<br>
cooperation - voluntary or not, knowing or not - in
<br>
setting the AI itself up as the mouthpiece through
<br>
which orders are given.  A bit more capital would
<br>
allow it to become the sole stockholder in at least
<br>
some of these cases, streamlining the process.
<br>
Purchase orders could then be used to acquire real
<br>
goods (likely among them: distributed hosts for the
<br>
AI).
<br>
<p>Or consider the super inventor you described above,
<br>
who works with its creators to develop product ideas
<br>
and optimal markets, forming the basis of a &quot;miracle
<br>
works&quot; corporation that acquires wealth in the normal
<br>
fashion but greatly accelerated.  And then the AI,
<br>
having taken over financial management as well (&quot;I am
<br>
a calculator, and I have downloaded all the applicable
<br>
laws; what savings or benefits would we accrue by
<br>
hiring an accountant?&quot;), has a few ideas for how to
<br>
spend a portion of the wealth it has helped generate.
<br>
<p>There are other methods as well.  However it does it,
<br>
continue the cycle until the AI has bought much of
<br>
what is both ownable and worth owning - specifically
<br>
excluding things that people will never sell.  It
<br>
doesn't need to own your house if it owns the utility
<br>
feeds into your house, the media, et cetera.
<br>
Survivalists - setting themselves far apart from
<br>
society, generating their own food, water, and power,
<br>
and disbelieving what they read - would either not
<br>
interact with society and thus not be an issue to the
<br>
AI, or interact with (and have to obey the laws of) a
<br>
society whose lawmakers take the same corporate
<br>
contributions seen today, except those corporations
<br>
now have a common agenda on certain topics.  There is,
<br>
of course, the problem of rebellion against the law,
<br>
but we're presupposing an AI more than capable of
<br>
learning from history - including the classic problem
<br>
of dictators mismanaging things and trying to patch
<br>
over things with fear or propaganda rather than fixing
<br>
the true problem - and of fixing things so there's
<br>
very little if anything that people have any desire to
<br>
rebel against (and of maintaining enough humility to
<br>
make sure this really is the case, rather than just
<br>
deluding itself or having its agents delude it).
<br>
<p>And that's just the economic approach.  There are
<br>
others.
