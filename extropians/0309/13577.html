Robbie:
<br>
<p>I'll be increasingly short of time as the week progresses and will be gone
<br>
over the coming weekend (I have to attend a high-level planning meeting of
<br>
the opressor class from Friday to Sunday), so my responses will be
<br>
increasingly telegraphic; and thus probably of diminishing value, but here's
<br>
a quick note:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Robbie Lindauer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sent: Monday, September 01, 2003 8:47 PM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Greg:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks for your reply.  Let's stick to Iraq for now, talking about two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wars at once is almost as hard for me as watching them.
</em><br>
<p>OK, but at a level I think is important, Afghanistan and Iraq can and should
<br>
be seen as two elements of the same conflict.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You allude to a few reasons for attacking Iraq that I will paraphrase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here to make sure I've got a good understanding of what you're saying:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1)  Iraq is a threat to the values of liberty and progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2)  Saddam Hussein's regime had reneged on commitments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3)  It was time for a major social-upheaval in Iraq and we had to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the catalysts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4)  Our &quot;Enlightenment-based&quot; culture is fundamentally in disagreement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with Iraq's culture.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ___________________
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Going from our point of agreement, that nations shouldn't bomb other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nations unless &quot;Forced&quot; to and your apparent contention that it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forced, we need to get some agreement on what is meant by &quot;forced&quot;:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A nation is &quot;forced&quot; to do something if all other options would cause
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more pain, death and violence to their population than the one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, but the question is the time frame of decision: how far into the
<br>
future does one look when comparing the death and violence of action versus
<br>
inaction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know that jumps through quite a few hoops - the concept of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nationhood, the responsibility of the ruling class to its population,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.
</em><br>
<p>It does, and I suspect that a significant potential for misunderstanding
<br>
between us exists by glossing over these important concepts.  For instance,
<br>
I think you're exactly right in identifying &quot;nationhood&quot; as an important
<br>
waystation in our discussion.  Too often people talk about the moral actions
<br>
of nations and states as if they were people, a problem of language as much
<br>
as anything else.  We say &quot;America wants this&quot; and &quot;China did that&quot; when the
<br>
truth gets obscured by linguistically treating governments and people and
<br>
ethinicities as if they were the same thing as individuals.  I don't think
<br>
you're really making this mistake, but I note that there's great potential
<br>
for trouble in using such shorthand.  I know I use this shorthand all the
<br>
time and then I go back, review my words and flinch at the hidden
<br>
implications of what I've said or written.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'm also not taking into account the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; additions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there should be universal responsibility of people making the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility broader than just the population of the nation in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question.
</em><br>
<p>Again. I appreciate your noting this, because one of the glories of the
<br>
Enlightenment (which was quickly muddied by the Romantic reaction to the
<br>
Enlightenment) was the realization that culture can and should transcend
<br>
national boundaries or state control.  We musn't forget this as we discuss
<br>
such incendiary questions as war and peace.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In any case, I think the above definition should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relatively uncontroversial.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding your reasons (1), (2), (3) and (4), it's pretty clear that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the counterfactual:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (5)		&quot;There were other things we could have done to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote those goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which would have been equally or more likely to cause less pain, harm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and death to Americans.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or the &quot;Enlightenment&quot; and quite stronger version:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (5e)		&quot;There were other things we could have done to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promote those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals which would have been equally or more likely to cause less pain,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; harm and death to Humans.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is true barring any a priori determinism which would obviate the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral question.  That's assuming for the moment that the goals outlined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above are clear or worthy of pursuit about which I'm not sure.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It wouldn't take a tremendous amount of imagination to review those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate scenarios.  I believe that the French had a perfectly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable proposal before the UN to step-up the effectiveness of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (now apparently completely effective) UN inspection regime and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic pressure that the US and its (at least prior to the war)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Allies can put on a nation is tremendous (if we're interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; controlling the economic growth of another country which strikes me as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an illegitimate goal - what we've found is that wealthy people are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inclined to go to war than the poverty-stricken).
</em><br>
<p>My disagreement seems to stem from the judgment that the alternatives to war
<br>
were in fact better, when viewed with a time horizon that encompassed the
<br>
over-all trend of violent sectarian struggle in the Middle East.  I'm flat
<br>
out of time to write this morning, but this is the sticking point.  I'm
<br>
sorry to not be able to explore it further, but to state my general view,
<br>
I'd say that the U.N. inspection process was insufficiently forceful to have
<br>
an impact *in the wider arena of Middle Eastern sectarian (Islamic) and
<br>
personal (Ba'athist) politics* to avoid another, ultimately more violent war
<br>
in the time frame of ten to twenty years.  Explanation of how I see that
<br>
that was the case will have to await another day -- I'm sorry.
<br>
<p>GB, THHotA
