BillK &lt;<a href="mailto:bill@wkidston.freeserve.co.uk?Subject=Re:%20Is%20theft%20becoming%20impossible?">bill@wkidston.freeserve.co.uk</a>&gt; said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I laughed at the story about the thief who stole a GPS tracking device:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.adn.com/24hour/weird/story/985993p-6924904c.html">http://www.adn.com/24hour/weird/story/985993p-6924904c.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but then I started thinking about it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Expensive cars are now protected by GPS locator systems. These and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similar devices have a transmitter that will call for help if they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stolen and they are becoming cheaper and more widespread.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Computers can have security systems that 'phone home' as soon as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connect to the internet, so stolen computers can turn themselves in.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CNET had an article about RFID tags that can be fitted to everything.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; CNET was worried about the 'Big Brother' tracking implications because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every time you walked past a scanner your clothes, possessions, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would report your presence to the authorities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://news.com.com/2010-1069-980325.html">http://news.com.com/2010-1069-980325.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Register says that manufacturers want to change all barcodes into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RFID tags:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/31461.html">http://www.theregister.co.uk/content/55/31461.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And the European Central Bank is even considering putting RFID tags into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paper money!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if everything can be 'tagged' then surely this means that theft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; becomes impossible? It would need a central database to record changes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of ownership of course, with the previous owner required to authorize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the transfer. But if the authorities want to do suspect tracking then they 
</em><br>
will 
<br>
<em>&gt; need to build the central database anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Police would just need to visit your home and the scanner computer would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list everything on the premises that was not registered to you. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; future they might be able to do this without even physically entering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the premises.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So we can look forward to a near future without casual theft, burglary,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mugging, car theft, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That should help to empty the prisons as well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh joyous day!
</em><br>
<p><p>But aren't something like 3/4 of all people in American jails in there for 
<br>
drug offenses?
