<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;Cute, but it has the standard Creator problem.  How was the Creator created?  
<br>
<em>  &gt;From what process did the original first SuperIntelligence spring?   Unless 
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;somehow the snake does indeed swallow its own tail, there must have been one 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;universe that was not created by some SI.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;- samantha&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course you are right on this issue. I purchased a book by Edward Harrison, a retired cosmologist from Amhurst or U. Mass. The original work was published in 1985. He viewed the universe as created by &quot;angels&quot; or as some of us might quip &quot;godz&quot; and I wonder if the author of this new book, Biocosm; was not also influenced by Andrei Linde, from Stanford? Harrison seemed to conclude that the universe was the mind. Perhaps looking at the universe in a different way then your typical astronomer, may help the species forward. This is my hope, anyways.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe he'd read Philip Jose farmer's &quot;World of Tiers&quot; series, which I recall from the 1970s. That posited lots of &quot;pocket universes&quot; created by ultra-advanced beings. it then turns out the home universe of the ultra-advanced was itself an artificial one. I suppose the response is, yes, there has to be some 'original' universe where superbeings arose, but how then do we know what kind of universe we are in?
