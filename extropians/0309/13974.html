</em><br>
<p>You have to realize that cancer goes through 3 stages.  First,
<br>
uncontrolled cell division.  Second, production of angiogenisis
<br>
factors to increase blood supply (and therefore nutrient availability).
<br>
Third, metastasis where the cancer spreads throughout the body.
<br>
<p>If you can limit it to the first stage it is less probable
<br>
that cancer can kill an individual.  The progression through
<br>
each of the stages involves the expansion of cells with a
<br>
greater number of specific mutations or chromosome rearrangements.
<br>
There is a fairly large debate right now within the cancer researcher
<br>
community if chromosome rearrangements might not be the start of the
<br>
problem followed by mutations rather than the other way around.
<br>
I suspect it will turn out to be a mix perhaps depending on cancer
<br>
type.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So the five mutation model may not describe every form of cellular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cancer, there are probably four mutation or eight mutation variants?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The number of mutations may differ, but is seems safe to say the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle and the requirement for certain number of certain mutations to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take place is still valid.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  The problem is that &quot;mutations&quot; tends to be a general term
<br>
and one has to get down to specifics -- these can include things
<br>
like &quot;point mutations&quot; (i.e. the change of a specific base so the
<br>
protein does not function as it is supposed to), deletions (i.e.
<br>
a section of the gene gets deleted), insertions (i.e. some extra
<br>
code gets inserted into the DNA), and chromosome segment exchanges
<br>
(that produce cases where genes that are supposed to be off get turned
<br>
on or genes that are supposed to be on get turned off).
<br>
<p>Its a mess when you get into the details.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My main point was that once a cell gets a mutation, all of its offspring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have that same mutation (unless some are lucky enough to have that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutation reversed accidently).
</em><br>
<p>Yes, that is why most cancers occur in cells that are significantly biased
<br>
to divide -- they probably need fewer mutations to run amok.  Reversal
<br>
is unlikely -- it is more likely that your immune system just might
<br>
be able to recognize the signs of cancerous (malformed) proteins within
<br>
a cell and take out the offending cells.  This is difficult but serves
<br>
as an interesting explanation behind the remission of some cancers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus the older you get, the more likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are to have more of your cells have more and more mutations, even in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the absence of pollution or radiation.
</em><br>
<p>I would guess that free radicals and radiation are the primary sources.
<br>
That would explain why cancer remains relatively constant across people
<br>
with a wide variety of diets that may or may not contain various toxins.
<br>
Free radicals would also explain in part why CR is effective in extending
<br>
longevity -- fewer free radicals leads to less DNA damage leads to less
<br>
cancer (as well as other causes of &quot;aging&quot;).
<br>
<p>The problem, IMO, is that it appears cells use various pro-oxidant
<br>
molecules (e.g. nitric oxide, perhaps superoxide, etc.) as signal
<br>
molecules and so they compensate for the amount of anti-oxidant molecules
<br>
that may be available.  That explains why massive supplementation of
<br>
anti-oxidants only has limited effectiveness in extending lifespan.
<br>
<p>I think that natural toxins may play only a limted role.
<br>
For example several types of cancer have been linked to viruses
<br>
(e.g. HPV).  Others are linked to numbers of hormonal cycles that
<br>
promote cell division (e.g. breast cancer).
<br>
<p>Some individuals clearly have molecular signal systems where
<br>
natural toxins actually help more than they hurt.  This makes the
<br>
whole process of attempting to adopt a useful strategy a nightmare
<br>
because we don't currently relatively inexpensive genotyping that
<br>
would allow one to determine whether such toxins help more than
<br>
they hurt.  As a side note -- the systems that metabolize the
<br>
plant toxins are relatively the same as those that metabolize
<br>
drugs.  So it is effectively impossible for physicians to prescribe
<br>
drug doses that work well without a complete understanding of
<br>
ones genetic systems that remove toxins/drugs from ones body.
<br>
The variations in rates and processes of metabolizing toxins/drugs
<br>
can be quite significant from individual to individual.  There
<br>
are probably 50 or more genes involved.  Each gene may have
<br>
multiple variations within a population because they only impact
<br>
reproductive and survival capacity to a very limited extent --
<br>
so natural evolution will allow the accumulation of many variations.
<br>
<p>Some of us may deal with toxins/drugs quite well (perhaps a good
<br>
sitation for toxins but a not-so-good situation for drugs where
<br>
one might want effects to last longer).  Some of us may have the
<br>
reverse situation (poor toxin removal but drugs are more effective).
<br>
<p>Its a real mess at this time.
