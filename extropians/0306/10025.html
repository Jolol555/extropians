</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; You could start by fixing the stuff 9/11 was about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Religious idiocy?
</em><br>
<p>Sure.  That's a good place to start :) I *totally* agree with reforming 
<br>
the splinter groups of christianity that specifically choose to support
<br>
Israel because it will bring about the second coming of christ.  I am
<br>
so *terribly* happy we found some common ground :P
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US support for Israel (financial, military) and how that relates to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Palestinians.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of the hijackers were not Palestinians nor were they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor, and most Indonesian Moslems hate America as much as the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arabs do and they've never seen a Palestinian in their life.
</em><br>
<p>So what you mean to say is that coming to the aid of your allies (in
<br>
this case
<br>
fellow muslims) is Wrong...  So what happened to your previous
<br>
justification of
<br>
the US entering kuwait to help its ally?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Occupation of Saudia Arabia
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America was there at the request of the Saudi Arabia 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government to prevent a invasion, and now that Saddam is no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer a threat they are leaving. Not the sort of behavior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you'd expect from a conquering power.
</em><br>
<p>Oh that's right :) Let me know when the ticker-tape parade begins...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Removing any policies in place that purposefully destabilize the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;region
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Destabilize? Before 911 the American policy was always to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preserve the Status Quo, things are different now and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frightens many in the Mid East and that's a good thing. Be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; afraid, be very afraid.
</em><br>
<p>And before 911, the status quo was good?  I suppose that would
<br>
Explain the 3 wars between Israel and Egypt, the ongoing palestinian
<br>
Revolt against Israel, the 1 Between Iraq and Kuwait, the 1 Between
<br>
Iraq and Iran, the 1 between Israel and Syria, the 1 between Israel and
<br>
Lebanon..[and a couple others]?  So its your contention that
<br>
purposefully
<br>
Preserving the status quo is beneficial for that region?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; so you can get your oil cheaper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, if you can think of a policy that leads to cheaper oil 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm all for it.
</em><br>
<p>More than happy :) Someone's just pioneered a (commercial) process
<br>
which recycles carbon based materials [organic refuse] and plastics
<br>
Into oil and gas.  Its depolymerizes polymers.  Or you could tap your
<br>
own oil reserves in Alaska.  Or build some more of those nuclear 
<br>
powerplants.  Or design your houses better so you don't continiously
<br>
Waste significant amount of energy heating and cooling your houses.
<br>
how about this, the horror, limit your energy consumption to that of
<br>
your europaen counterparts (per capita of course)... Hell ride a bike 
<br>
to work.  I'ld even support something as simple as mandating a certain
<br>
amount of fuel efficiency for consumer vehicles....
<br>
<p>All of those would positively affect your balance sheet for costs
<br>
associated with oil purchases.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  &gt; Don't mind &quot;fundamentalist&quot; or religious based political 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups if and  &gt; when they gain power so long as  they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *democratically* elected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't give a damn if their democratically elected or not, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if 51% want to kill the other 49% then they have lost all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral authority in my book and 
</em><br>
<p>Democracy cuts both ways, eh?  Sucks when the majority
<br>
Doesn't do what you want, eh?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; if they want to kill us (and some do) 
</em><br>
<p>And so the entire group is guilty by association? 
<br>
And how did you manage to equate fundamentalism with wanting
<br>
Americans dead?  Just fix the aforementioned policies.  I'm sure
<br>
they'ld be more than happy to leave you alone...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; then I have even less respect for them and will do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my best to kill them first. 
</em><br>
<p>So I guess you would have a problem with those religious nuts 
<br>
adopting your particular line of thought?  I mean, you've just clearly
<br>
indicated your intention to kill any fundamentalists, because a few
<br>
members of theirs may want you dead [I'll give you that assumption,
<br>
for the sake of the broader point]....  Does that mean that the
<br>
entire group should attempt to kill you now?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;By the way Hitler gained power 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legally too, not that I care.
</em><br>
<p>Hehehe, can't resist.... So did Bush :P
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;Just because western mentality espouses separation of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; church and state
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; as a *THEORY* does not mean everyone else DOES or SHOULD.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All I can say is if they want my respect they'll have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separation of church and state.
</em><br>
<p>They're not trying to earn your respect; In the grand 
<br>
scheme of things, they're judged for their actions by God, not you
<br>
&nbsp;-- a fact that seems to have escaped your notice... Pretty
<br>
much all they want you to do is stop fucking with them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;      &gt;As I recall,  the muslim caliphs did well under an  Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      &gt;government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You recall that do you? Well then you must be very old indeed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because Islamic civilization has gone straight downhill for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 800 years due to an uninterrupted line of incredibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incompetent governments. They were great once but that was a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very long time ago.
</em><br>
<p>HAHAHAHA :) That is one of my favorite points to bring up...
<br>
Sure, go ahead, pick a fight with a people who have a long
<br>
term view of things...   I mean, the battles might be quick, but
<br>
how long do you think, will be the war?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; stop insulting the prophet mohamed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why? Clearly he was an asshole.
</em><br>
<p>&lt;grin&gt; perhaps, but its still not polite :)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; I have yet to see a single muslim proclaim loudly,  &quot;Jesus was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; goat-buggering RAPIST!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Too bad, because Jesus was an asshole too.
</em><br>
<p>Well at least your consistent :)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt;freedom of religion is gauranteed under the koran
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well now you're just being silly.
</em><br>
<p>Not really; just more informed...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;lekum deenakum, wee leeya deen.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have your religion and I have mine. &lt;&lt;lets leave it at
<br>
that&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>That's one of the earliest surrahs in the koran;
<br>
Its also one of my favorites.
<br>
<p>omard-out
