<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Behalf Of Lee Corbin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sent: Thursday, June 12, 2003 7:44 PM
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I propose a pledge.  We could start by debating certain 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideals that are much more down-to-earth and concrete than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian ideals. These would seek to &quot;govern&quot; (in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loosest possible sense of the term) the manner of debate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here.  (Besides, it would be vastly interesting to see if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such ideals could be agreed upon in the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then, perhaps, if some general agreement was reached, one's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on-line &quot;signing&quot; of the pledge might give one little pause 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when retaliating against the latest outrage from the other side.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just an idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I cannot refrain from immediately proposing three.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    I acknowledge that most posters are of fundamentally good
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    will, and sound mind, and despite having from time to time
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    gone beyond the limits of good taste, and despite having
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    over-reacted to others' posts, they are capable---even my
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    bitterest ideological adversaries, as well as myself---of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    doing better.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    I acknowledge that no identifiable political or philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    position has a monopoly on truth and rightness, including
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    mine.  Extremely intelligent and highly moral people of all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    persuasions can be found (perhaps amazingly) holding almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    any position whatsoever.  Therefore, I will conduct myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    in as high-minded manner as I can, especially in refraining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    from name-calling and ad hominem remarks, and will strive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    address other posters respectfully.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    I will try to avoid using the list as an emotional outlet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    instead merely to state the truth as I see it, and point out,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    both courteously and politely what appear to me to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    mistaken philosophies and conjectures of those I disagree with.
</em><br>
<p>Well said, Lee!  If you care about this list as a forum for continuing
<br>
discussions of vital ideas and issues, PLEASE read -- and REREAD --
<br>
Lee's post and make a conscious and continuing effort to adopt Lee's
<br>
pledge.
<br>
<p>Lee's suggestion is especially important when it comes to topics
<br>
touching on politics and ideology.  Because truth claims are so much
<br>
more difficult to falsify in these areas, and because we higher primates
<br>
have an inescapable emotional attachment to our cultural in-group, the
<br>
temptation to escalate rhetoric when addressing such subjects is great.
<br>
This means that people who value self-governance must work ALL THE
<br>
HARDER to embody ideals of courtesy in their own communication.  Before
<br>
you employ sarcasm, THINK about the effect it will have on people whom
<br>
you KNOW disagree strongly with you and on the over-all atmosphere on
<br>
the list.
<br>
<p>A personal note.  Someone recently asked for a statement by people
<br>
identified with list governance about their own personal opinions on the
<br>
war in Iraq.  I'll respond.  I favored the war, although with strong
<br>
reservations.  I know that others WHOSE OPINIONS I RESPECT disagree with
<br>
me.  This is why I have made my communications on the subject brief and
<br>
as unemotional and polite as I can.
