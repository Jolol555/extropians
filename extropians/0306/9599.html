<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Aum Sriyinko executed attacks intended to be on the same scale as 9/11
</em><br>
<em> &gt; or even larger.  They had no state support. They operated inside of
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Japan.  
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>I don't know what you mean, before the nerve gas attack in the subway 
<br>
<p>Aum Sriyinko has secure bases, Japan did nothing to stop them. That 
<br>
<p>was no longer true after the attack and as a result the organization no 
<br>
<p>longer exists. Not supporting terrorists is insufficient, you must actively
<br>
<p>oppose them or one way or another you'll be sorry, just ask Saddam.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt; Their anger comes from their poverty (relative to us)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Yes, and they're poor relative to Japan or Korea too, and they started from 
<br>
<p>zero just 50 years ago and have no natural resources. With all that oil the 
<br>
<p>Arabs should be the richest people on Earth, but they blew it big time.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>   &gt; their despair  (lack of future opportunities)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;the oppression of their governments
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><p><em> &gt; (supported or installed by the US)
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Some were, but the opponents were not exactly Jefferson style libertarians,
<br>
<p>they were in fact even more brutal and brainless than the thugs 
<br>
<p>they wound up with.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;their indoctrination into fundamentalist  religion.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Yes. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em> &gt;their feeling of having been  humiliated by the west
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Yes, and the reason they feel humiliated is that they made an ass of themselves;
<br>
<p>their culture has not produced a good original idea in 500 years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em> &gt;A real plan on terrorism would target these root causes by spreading
</em><br>
<em> &gt;affluence, freedom, and opportunity. [.] it all comes back to 
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt;spreading democracy and affluence.  IMHO, that should be the 
</em><br>
<p><em> &gt;US's #1 priority in foreign policy 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Certainly, I want freedom and affluence for everybody, but you can't 
<br>
<p>accomplish that by lying and telling Islam what it wants to hear, 
<br>
<p>that all the idiotic decisions they've made over the last 500 years 
<br>
<p>were really good ideas. They were not.
