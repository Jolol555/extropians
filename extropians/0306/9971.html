<p><em>&gt; From <a href="http://www.dogsofthedow.com/">http://www.dogsofthedow.com/</a>
</em><br>
<p>I took a closer look at this trading strategy for your sake, Gary. It is not
<br>
immediately clear from the website that anyone actually followed the
<br>
strategy since 1973 (probably they are quoting a theoretical annual return
<br>
based on 20-20 hindsight) but in any case it is very obvious why it would
<br>
have worked so well since 1973. 
<br>
<p>The strategy is to buy the highest dividend stocks in the Dow at the
<br>
beginning of each year, and then sell them and rebuy the highest dividend
<br>
stocks again at beginning of each new year. This strategy would have worked
<br>
wonderfully since the 70's for the simple reason that interest rates have
<br>
plummeted. I don't remember the exact figure but the yield on the 30 year
<br>
treasury bond during the inflationary 70's peaked well into the double
<br>
digits. Today it yields a meager 4.21% 
<br>
<p>Stocks that pay high dividends outperform the market when interest rates are
<br>
declining because the risk of owning dividend paying stocks becomes more
<br>
acceptable to investors seeking current income. People and institutions in
<br>
need of income sell government and corporate guaranteed bonds and cash out
<br>
of interest earning bank accounts to buy the riskier but higher yielding
<br>
stocks. In particular they are attracted to high dividend stocks in the Dow,
<br>
because these are large low-risk companies.
<br>
<p>If interest rates rise again to levels seen in the 70's then the opposite
<br>
will occur and those who follow this trading strategy will get creamed. The
<br>
strategy will underperform the market by as much as it has outperformed it.
<br>
To make matters worse, the stockmarket itself is likely to fair poorly if
<br>
interest rates rise. There is nothing more painful than underperforming the
<br>
market while it is declining.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I wish I had followed this system instead of being greedy and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investing exclusively in technology stocks!
</em><br>
<p>If you are considering the possibility of following this strategy then the
<br>
questions you need to ask yourself are: 
<br>
<p>1) &quot;Do I think interest rates will continue to decline over the long term?&quot; 
<br>
2) &quot;Am I really so smart that I should risk money on my predictions about
<br>
interest rates?&quot;  
<br>
<p>I always have an answer to the first question but as someone who accepts the
<br>
efficient market hypothesis I never answer yes to the second question. 
<br>
<p>I won't make a prediction about interest rates here but I will say that I
<br>
really hope they don't decline very much from current levels. We are not far
<br>
from sinking into an economic depression. It was for this reason that
<br>
Greenspan and his cronies at the Fed decided not to cut the discount rate
<br>
last time around.
