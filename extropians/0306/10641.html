From: Wei Dai [mailto:<a href="mailto:weidai@weidai.com?Subject=RE:%20The%20Future%20of%20Secrecy">weidai@weidai.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that whatever economic pressure exists towards 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standardizing on verifiable mental architectures will apply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more towards standardizing on motivations. A group of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agents with the same mental architecture and different 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations faces huge disadvantages when competing with a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; group of agents with a variety of mental architectures and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same motivations. The latter group can optimize their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental architectures for efficiency and specialization, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than verifiability.
</em><br>
<p>I think your mention of groups is quite interesting here.
<br>
<p>It does indeed seem likely that we'll see different groups with
<br>
different mental architectures.  That raises the possibility that
<br>
transparency across groups will be much more difficult than
<br>
transparency within those groups.[*]
<br>
<p>And transparency within those groups will depend upon the details of
<br>
the mental architecture.  While there are advantages afforded to
<br>
groups that are able to achieve a high degree of transparency, there
<br>
are also likely disadvantages resulting from the design overhead
<br>
necessary to ensure that transparency.
<br>
<p>The disadvantages accrue to both solo individuals and to members of
<br>
the group.  The advantages accrue only when multiple individuals are
<br>
cooperating.  The advantages of transparency are likely greater for
<br>
groups whose members cooperate more fully.  This suggests an
<br>
evolutionary feedback loop - as a group achieves a level of
<br>
transparency it can achieve a level of greater cooperation which
<br>
encourages an even greater level of transparency, etc...
<br>
<p>So one wonders if entities which are truly able to achieve mental
<br>
transparency end up on a path towards merger into composite entities,
<br>
whereas entities that are less able to achieve transparency remain
<br>
more individual, and are perhaps pushed towards ecological niches
<br>
where they can take advantage of the freedom their individuality
<br>
affords them to rapidly experiment with new mental designs without the
<br>
burden of transparency protocols and such which would otherwise limit
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>mez
<br>
<p>* - The notion of groups who are able to achieve high degrees of
<br>
internal transparency but are unable to achieve transparency with
<br>
members of other groups is actually rather disturbing.  It suggests
<br>
the possibility of more deeply embedded tribalism among diverse future
<br>
entities, with all the ills that tribalism brings.
