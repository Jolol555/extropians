<em>&gt; But if you are the same person that you were last month,

<em>&gt; what are you besides information?  What else could you
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>If you are the same person you were 10^43 Planck increments ago, even 
<br>
though all of the matter waves in your body have shifted places, why would 
<br>
you not be the same person after a slightly different interaction within 
<br>
the same huge wavefunction?
<br>
<p>There is no &quot;stuff&quot;.  Stuff is an illusion generated by a brain adapted to 
<br>
deal with complex regularities of the macroscopic world as if they were 
<br>
substances.  You are dynamics of information in a probability 
<br>
distribution, dynamics distributed over an unimaginable number of changes 
<br>
and interactions, stretched over an incredibly long time period. 
<br>
Uploading is a change scarcely more drastic, and no more high-level, than 
<br>
the changes your brain is undergoing right now.  It is only the appearance 
<br>
of substance, the illusion of stuff, that leads you to think there is any 
<br>
difference between just standing there having a temporally evolving brain 
<br>
and being uploaded.  Each is a physical evolution that preserves complex 
<br>
correlations in the wavefunction, and this is all that matters.
