<p>I not sure I follow your reasoning here Mike.
<br>
<p>Fossil fuel generation plants already exist, indeed, so now do some 
<br>
new windmills, so once these alternate forms of generation are
<br>
able to distribute electricity to the grid their relevant costs to supply
<br>
would seem to depend more now on the operational costs rather than
<br>
the construction costs.
<br>
<p>As you say, a new player (with their windmills not yet built)
<br>
entering the electrical supply market when interest rates on 
<br>
construction capital are higher would find the cost of entry higher.
<br>
<p>Just as an afterthought, I understood that it is the nature of 
<br>
electricity that it needs to be generated at the same time as it is 
<br>
used. ie . They are no super large batteries akin to water reservoirs
<br>
etc.  So windmills would only be able to provide power to the 
<br>
grids when the wind blows. And the net demand for electricity will 
<br>
depend on when most of it is being used.
<br>
<p>I did some contract work for a hydro electricity plant years ago
<br>
and they had to balance to timing of the release of water to turn
<br>
the turbines with when there was a need for power and when 
<br>
the water could also be used as a downstream resource for 
<br>
irrigation or river maintenance etc.
<br>
