<p>Indeed, but I didn't get from his article whether Sterlong saw this 
<br>
(relinquishment) as a possibility or was just trying to show how absurd 
<br>
it was.
<br>
<p>I've wondered whether Sterling got sloppy, always being number 2. _Holy 
<br>
Fire_ and _Distraction_ were ok, but nothing like _Schismatrix_ but 
<br>
Gibson's _Pattern Recognition_ seems almost right up there with 
<br>
_Neuromancer_. As in, Gibson still has it...
<br>
<p>Maybe he is slipping into fantasy in his emeritus years. I've seen old 
<br>
folks get rigid, to the point where I thought immortals would end up 
<br>
sitting in a chair all day muttering longremembered hatreds and saying 
<br>
'leave me alone'. Perhaps an opposite might occur to those who 
<br>
self-educate throughout life, after some decades, everything reminds you 
<br>
of everything else. For example, I'm often more fascinated by tangents, 
<br>
by the dynamics of a conversation rather than the content, by amusing 
<br>
synchronicities that occur only because of subtle deja vue experiences 
<br>
meaningless to anyone else.
<br>
<p>I don't admit to knowing anything about anything other than programming 
<br>
and web development, and there I see it as an established beachhead but 
<br>
beyond that there's a web-induced singularity. I can feel it reaching in 
<br>
with slender fingers when I work, but surprise myself I still have the 
<br>
discipline to prevent analysis paralysis. Of course once I abstract my 
<br>
work away from the computer maybe I can enter fantasy land and write 
<br>
unimplementable draft specifications for W3C.
<br>
<p>But I'd take fantasy over rigidness any day. The path of Isaac Newton 
<br>
rather than Archie Bunker (showing my age here).
