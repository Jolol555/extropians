<em>&gt; ### For all the decades of unmet expectations, AI relied on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing power of the order of an ant, and only recently, as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Moravec writes, did they graduate to the computing power of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mouse. Since AI on ant-powered computers gave ant-powered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results, and AI on mouse-powered computers gives 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mouse-powered capacities (such as target tracking, simple 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; learning, simple motor control), we may expect that AI on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human-level computers will give human-level results.
</em><br>
<p>I like this answer but also Harvey's rebuttal of it.
<br>
<p>Most AI researchers that I know of are not overly concerned with
<br>
processing power.  They think the fundamental problems of AI are
<br>
design problems.
<br>
<p>But as you point out, roboticists do care about computing power.
<br>
<p>I find this an interesting dichotomy, actually.  Roboticists, computer
<br>
vision researchers, and the like deal in interacting with the messy
<br>
physical world.  
<br>
<p>More traditional AI branches that concern themselves with more
<br>
abstract reasoning problems like knowledge representation or mimicking
<br>
human experts deal with relatively clean and sparse sets of data.
<br>
Even CYC's eventual knowledge database is still small compared to the
<br>
relative flood that a computer vision system must deal with.
<br>
<p>This suggests that you're right in that additional processing power
<br>
will enable the creation of software and robots with higher levels of
<br>
sensory and locomotor intelligence.
<br>
<p>However it's not clear to me how we'll bridge the gap between that
<br>
kind of intelligence and the abstract reasoning that we humans have.
<br>
<p>Right now if I had infinite computing power and wanted to do it I'd
<br>
employ an evolutionary technique.  Unfortunately, this is Eliezer's
<br>
worst nightmare - a new form of intelligence grown by evolution and
<br>
not necessarily friendly to us.  
<br>
<p>In any case, your post has mostly convinced me that increased
<br>
computing power in and of itself may lead us to this this kind of
<br>
messy, physically-rooted intelligence.  Just not the clean, abstract,
<br>
designed-from-the-top intelligence that people usually associate with
<br>
AI.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Human-level computing power is going to be available to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SingInst in about 15 years, so we can expect the recursive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-enhancement of the FAI to take off around that time.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not convinced of this.  You're basing this on Moravec's
<br>
extrapolation of computing power necessary to replace the retina to
<br>
the whole brain?  I think that's a pretty rough model. The retina
<br>
lacks much of the complexity of the cortex.
