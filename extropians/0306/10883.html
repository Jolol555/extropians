<p><em>&gt; Brett raises one of our oldest and most fruitlessly debated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topics: whether an upload or a cryonics revivee is &quot;the same&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person he was before.
</em><br>
<p>Ah a challenge :-) !
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I believe the question is meaningless, based in part on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions like these:
</em><br>
<p>Let me paraphase and you can correct me if I misrepresent
<br>
you. 
<br>
<p>You hypothesis that the question (above) is meaningless and
<br>
offer the following questions as corroborative evidence.
<br>
I have some doubt as to the validity of such a process for 
<br>
getting at the truth but let's move on. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you &quot;the same&quot; person you were yesterday? 
</em><br>
<p>Depends on how we define the slippery word &quot;person&quot;. But for
<br>
the moment I'll say that yes I am essentially the same person I
<br>
was yesterday. Some of my atoms have changed. But that there
<br>
has been no interuption of the &quot;super-conscious&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you know? 
</em><br>
<p>I don't *know* I merely hold it as more likely than the alternative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Isn't  this ultimately just as much a &quot;leap of faith&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as believing that you are the same person after awakening 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from an  upload or cryonic suspension?
</em><br>
<p>No not as much. Not if the 'super-consciousness' (unconscious
<br>
plus conscious) is interrupted in cryonic suspension. 
<br>
<p>The difference is some sort of continuity. Whilst asleep or in 
<br>
a coma my brain would continue to show activity. The 
<br>
ceasation of brain activity is an extra difference. Given what
<br>
we (scientists) and mores specifically me, a more limited
<br>
amateur instance of the class) understands about 
<br>
consciousness, this extra difference gives rise to a *higher*
<br>
degree of uncertainty that person X is the same after
<br>
coming out of a coma as opposed to coming out of cryonic
<br>
suspension.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or, suppose you are an upload.  Let's leave aside for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moment the question of whether you are &quot;the same&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person as before, but consider your identity going forward.
</em><br>
<p>This *seems* to me to be a shift in topic now, but ok.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose you learn that the computer that is running you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uses a time-sharing architecture like most computers today.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It occasionally stops your program for a short while, running
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other people's programs.  It rapidly switches among 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone's program, giving the illusion that everyone is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running at once.  Does this make you doubt that you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not &quot;the same&quot; person from moment to moment?
</em><br>
<p>We have supposed I have *learnt* that the computer I am
<br>
running on time-shares. That additional knowledge *must* 
<br>
influence my world-view. Something in my world-view has
<br>
to change. Either my operating assumption that personhood
<br>
requires continuation of the 'super-conscious' or my concept
<br>
of personhood in someother respect. 
<br>
<p>Within the constraint of this clearly I *cannot* be exactly
<br>
&quot;the same&quot; person from moment to moment as in some 
<br>
moments I am have learn that I am not a running program
<br>
at all. (Raises an interesting question as to how I might have
<br>
learnt such a thing but that is an aside). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Suppose the computer were shut down for a longer time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and your program then allowed to run again.  Do you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greater doubts that you are &quot;the same&quot; person?
</em><br>
<p>No. The duration of the ceasation of the &quot;super-conscious'
<br>
does not affect the notion that any ceasation potentially snuffs
<br>
it out and what is restarted is a new super-conscious. 
<br>
<p>The granularity of a moment is probably related to something
<br>
like the speed of light.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; For me, the intuition that there is an objective fact about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether you are &quot;the same&quot; in one incarnation as another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not work well given these kinds of gray areas.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I see the gray areas as you do yet. I am wondering
<br>
instead how malleable you concept of personhood may turn
<br>
out to be.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If &quot;sameness&quot; is really well defined, either you should be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;the same&quot; or not &quot;the same&quot;.  It doesn't work well to say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there are gray areas.  It seems to be a binary relation, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you hold to this philosophical perspective.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I'm following you now, but if I am the notion of 
<br>
who and what sort of phenomena one thinks one is can seemingly
<br>
change with additional data too. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet the examples above, which can be further subdivided and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permuted ad infinitum, demonstrate many kinds of gray areas
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on advanced technology that can manipulate the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substrates that embody our brains. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ultimately it does not work (for me at least) to imagine that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a fact of the matter about whether two incarnations of a mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are &quot;the same&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Are you allowing then mulitple fuzzy definitions. Being aware that
<br>
&quot;the same&quot; should be definable to the point it is not a variable but
<br>
that the tradoff of such certainty is that you introduce more 
<br>
variability into what you consider the phenomena of you is.
<br>
<p>Not sure I communicated that clearly or that it made sense.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
