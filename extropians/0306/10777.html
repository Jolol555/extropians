<em>&gt; One thing I don't get about the spending on tech weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Seems the US has such an overwhelming military advantage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that no single country in their right mind would take them on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a conventional or even nuclear war. 
</em><br>
<p>You say &quot;no single country in their right mind&quot;. You are making one too
<br>
many assumptions here.
<br>
<p>The US leadership has reached a consensus that the people of the US
<br>
have a right to live free of fear of nuclear annihilation at the hands
<br>
of insane dictators. We also have a right to this freedom without
<br>
having to sacrifice a large fraction of our GDP to get it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Add to that the fact that the US is linked in through a number
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of alliances. And I wonder what the need is for the type of big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toy &quot;defence spending&quot;. I heard Australian PM Howard talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about possibly being a buyer of nuclear defence shielding 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systems. This seems completely nuts to me. The chances of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being attacked by ICBMs etc seem virtually zero in comparison
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with say a suitcase nuke or dirty bomb or something similar. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ICBMs leave a trail that's like a return to sender with interest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; message. 
</em><br>
<p>Defense against ICBMs is something we can do with big technology
<br>
affordably. You are also assuming that insane megalomaniacs like to
<br>
attack without getting credit and the acclaim of their insane
<br>
followers. Name one major terrorist attack where we don't know exactly
<br>
who is responsible for the attack after the fact. Secrecy is only
<br>
desired as a means of ensuring that an attack is brought off
<br>
successfully. Attacking an enemy is only effective if the enemy
<br>
understands why it was attacked. Anonymous terrorist attacks do not
<br>
achieve desired ends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I used to reckon the stuff about the military/industrial complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running on an economic imperative that had nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much else besides preserving the status quo in spending was a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bit batty even in the cold war. But now, who is the US really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preparing to fight or defend itself against?
</em><br>
<p>The people of the US are essentially an isolationist people who value
<br>
their freedom, their livlihoods, and living in peace and resent the
<br>
degree to which the rest of you in the world have forced them to take
<br>
responsibility for things with your old world politics, agendas, hates,
<br>
feuds, etc. Truly advanced technology seems to indicate that getting
<br>
more of it actually will cost us less in the long run to keep the dogs
<br>
at bay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The types of weapons being built seem to be the wrong ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for fighting terrorists and small scale guerrilla wars. And these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to be exactly the sorts of conflict that are likely to arise.
</em><br>
<p>Terrorists and small scale guerrillas are always sheltered, trained,
<br>
aided, financed, and supplied by some nation-state(s) with an agenda of
<br>
their own. Denial of these shelters by overwhelming force seems to be
<br>
the strategy. One that has worked in Afghanistan, is working in Iraq,
<br>
and will continue to work elsewhere.
