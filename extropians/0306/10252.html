<em>&gt; &gt; I disagree.  There is no tiny kernel of truth.  None of these

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, of course by &quot;the enemy&quot; you mean Saddam Hussein.
</em><br>
<p>Or the communists, the terrorists, al Quaeda, bin Ladin, the North
<br>
Vietnamese, the 911 hijackers, and the Saudis.  We have been accused of
<br>
supporting all of these in the past week.  All without evidence.  It is
<br>
pretty extensive, wide-spread, and really bizarre!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But doesn't it all depend on how you conceive of what your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper duties are as a citizen?  Is it not also highly parameterized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by circumstances?  I'm sure that you can think of many historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations (or simulations) in which sufficient danger would exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or in which sufficient fealty would be the norm, that it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true that &quot;if you are not with us, then you are against us&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>NO, NO, NO, NO!  We cannot require people to express the government's
<br>
official line or be accused of treason for merely failing to express an
<br>
opinion.  This is so wrong, I can't imagine people buying into these loyalty
<br>
oaths.  Not expressing an opinion is not evidence of guilt.  People cannot
<br>
be accused of crimes for NOT doing anything.  People are innocent until
<br>
proven guilty.  We cannot allow the government to change this to being
<br>
guilty until proven innocent.  A lack of evidence is not proof of guilt.  (I
<br>
never thought I would have to explain this on the the Extropians list....)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I readily understand that you cannot take insults lying down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that you need to defend what &quot;anti-American&quot; would mean to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you (not that you and others have neglected this).  I myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt the utility or the wisdom of such provocations---yet if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could (and I don't know---perhaps you've tried) get those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to explain more concretely what they mean when they use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such terms, perhaps the disagreements would be loftier.
</em><br>
<p>You haven't followed the debate.  The terms are not unclear.  People are
<br>
being accused of specific terms with no evidence.  There is no failure on my
<br>
part to understand the slander being bandied about here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is going on is differing conceptions of what a country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a nation should be, and the proper amount of allegiance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is due.  ;-) Your cries of &quot;slander&quot; are just as much an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overreaction as theirs of &quot;war-criminal&quot;, or &quot;traitor&quot;, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps they did start it.
</em><br>
<p>Wrong.  When someone is accused of being supporting communism, terrorism, or
<br>
the enemy without any evidence, that is slander.  My complaints are not an
<br>
overreaction.  Accusations of crimes against the state with no evidence is a
<br>
much larger overreaction than merely defending against those accusations.
