<p><em>&gt; I think that at this point, I am going to be transparent on this list. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since no matter how I try to deal honestly, considerately, and firmly by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warning, requesting, or suggesting ways of dealing with post problems,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone is going to take my private message and send it to someone else to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either (a) complain; (b) *assume* something is occurring; (c) look for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support by inference.
</em><br>
<p>It was, I think, only a misunderstanding.  But in the spirit
<br>
of decency, I don't see how it is ever wrong to spread a true
<br>
account of what seems to be oppression or injustice, even if
<br>
one turns out to be completely mistaken in one's thoughts.
<br>
<p>For example, suppose that the list administrator sends me a
<br>
warning that I have broken the list rules.  It would be the
<br>
right thing---as a conscientious contributor---to consult
<br>
others, offlist, to find out if their opinion that was the
<br>
case if I couldn't make heads or tails of the charge.
<br>
<p>Next, one might even go onto the list itself and say, &quot;Can
<br>
anyone explain to me why that is considered to be a personal
<br>
attack?&quot;, or whatever.  Observe that this level of inquiry
<br>
is far different from continuing to engage in the forbidden
<br>
activity itself.
<br>
<p>But before going onto the list, it's possible that a
<br>
clarification can be issued---if need be---to someone
<br>
who had concluded something about the list which was
<br>
not true.
<br>
<p>In fact, I did involve two list administrators in an
<br>
effort to explain to certain people what was really
<br>
true about our list, people who had concluded that it
<br>
was all up with Extropians for them.  Finally, I have
<br>
asked for on-line clarifications, and everything now
<br>
seems fine.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll state upfront and in full sight that I am disappointed with a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people on this list who I have tried to be fair to, regardless what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume, because I think their contributions are often very meaningful, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it is my nature.
</em><br>
<p>Thank you.  I know that you and this list are fair, but
<br>
people newer to the forum don't know that, and I hope
<br>
they do now.  It's very gracious of you to say that their
<br>
contributions are often meaningful, and I think that your
<br>
statements above go a long way to putting this behind us.
<br>
<p>Thanks again,
<br>
Lee
