<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I will grant that to me and everyone relating to you the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; duplicate will be satisfactory.  I am more &quot;selfish&quot; when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it comes to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Absolutely!  This is the *crux* of the real philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; problem! We ought to posit the existence of a Most Selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Individual, and ask to what well-informed decisions he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would come.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There may be merit in that. I may actually know this guy :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me take a shot at describing him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Most Selfish Individual's well-informed decision can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be as good as his knowledge base. He is presumably rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and open to learning better survival options...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any 'leap of faith' this Most Selfish Individual takes will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as *small* and late as he can make them.
</em><br>
<p>This, of course, is also true of a wider class of beings who
<br>
want to know the truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But we are talking about a survival-oriented, selfish view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what is &quot;in it&quot; for an individual.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *I* perceive the world from a stand-point that is necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-centred. *My* senses collect data and *my* brain interprets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it as information. My &quot;self&quot;, a process which I understand emerges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with consciousness has amongst its attributes a desire for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;self&quot; preservation. It's a pretty strong desire and my worldview
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rightly or wrong informs *my* self about what seem to be more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and less optimal ways to pursue that desire.
</em><br>
<p>All that is very true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Personally, I don't find altruism a particularly useful concept,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; except as a shorthand, and I'm not sure it has anything to do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with *my* desire for self preservation one way or the other.
</em><br>
<p>I and many others *do* find it an exceedingly useful concept,
<br>
and it is important for everyone to acknowledge the genetic
<br>
origins of their altruism, and most importantly, decide whether
<br>
to jettison via memetic engineering or genetic engineering those
<br>
tendencies.  I fervently hope that people embrace their altruism.
<br>
<p>However you and I agree completely: it ought have NOTHING to do
<br>
with the philosophical questions of personal identity, and is
<br>
often a red herring.  Yes, certain others will, because they
<br>
wish to evolve a wider definition and meaning for &quot;self&quot;, do
<br>
foray into these waters; but (1) it goes against the behavior
<br>
and thinking of most people and (2) the resolution of any purely
<br>
philosophic problem seems easier (or perhaps I'm just not interested
<br>
in it).
<br>
<p>So shall we agree that in this thread, there will be no further
<br>
talk of altruism?  About that fascinating topic, and even its
<br>
relation to concepts of &quot;self&quot;, perhaps indeed other people should
<br>
start other discussions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Suppose that there existed a machine that could decompose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you into your constituent elements within a microsecond.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Then suppose that a few microseconds later, it reconstitutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you.  Now suppose that this entire process happens hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of times per second...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And this is NOT the place to inquire after the actual physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plausibility of such a device.  Yes, our notions of who and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what we are do depend on our basic understandings of physics,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but not on [a certain conceptually insignificant technical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; breakthrough].
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok. Stipulations noted. If I was to discover that this had in fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been happening my worldview would necessarily change. I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclude that continuity cannot be a necessary precondition for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-hood, as I have come to experience it, because I hadn't ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had continuity, I'd have been mistaken. But I think I've missed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your point as I think I am repeating something I said earlier here.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this experiment is suggestive only.  It is certainly not an
<br>
exercise in deductive reasoning to go from its possibility-in-principle
<br>
to a conclusion that YOU MUST ALLOW THAT THIS IS HAPPENING TO YOU RIGHT
<br>
NOW.
<br>
<p>However, we might further imagine that you lived in a population
<br>
one-half of which underwent this operation one hundred times per
<br>
second.  At this point, your intuition might suggest that since
<br>
everyone acted as if they were conscious, and were the same person,
<br>
then perhaps it was true.
<br>
<p>We routinely avoid solipsism by extending this notion to other people
<br>
(even though we feel no pain when they are pinched), and also go so
<br>
far as to extend it to animals.
<br>
<p>But what is important is the *story*, the *explanation* behind the
<br>
scenes.  If it's not at all compelling, then the above thought
<br>
experiment has little point.  The story is that when you examine
<br>
the *physics* associated with this operation happening to someone
<br>
else, then you wonder just what could be the difference between
<br>
the various 1/100 second versions.  In what sense are they different
<br>
people?  How is it possible that a person associated with one of them
<br>
vanishes the next instant?
<br>
<p>The only way that I have been able to figure out how it might
<br>
be possible for another person to flash into existence for 1/100th
<br>
of a second, and then to vanish forever into non-existence, is if
<br>
indeed there is someone overhead Who is stamping out souls, and
<br>
assigning them to these copies.  But we reject this (most of us).
<br>
<p>Instead, it seems far more likely that our minds are contaminated
<br>
with lingering notions of a soul, and that this is responsible for
<br>
our uneasiness at the prospect, say, of being teleported, or 
<br>
disassembled and reassembled.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ... the question is once an adult level of sentience is achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; can you capture the recursion counters in the wetware? A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; snapshot of the conscious process and memories and restore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it either onto an identical wetware substrate or a different set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of firmware on an upload. I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Why not?  [why couldn't these &quot;recursion counters&quot; be captured]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because I don't *know* enough about how my consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the experience of self-hood manifests to assume that it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persist completely decoupled from a matter substrate for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; length of time.
</em><br>
<p>No one that I know of imagines that it can persist without
<br>
a material substrate, except non-materialists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My current thinking is no substrate means no conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing (or unconscious processing either). No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness process means no self concept process. In short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assume that no brain means a discontinuation of me because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems prudent to do so.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, certainly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Is this the scenario where life and consciousness spring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back into the new structure at the instant of its reassembly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because they were an inherent part of it?  In my experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains grow they aren't top down or bottom up assembled.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, life and consciousness &quot;springs back&quot; into the new
<br>
structure because they were only derivative processes to
<br>
begin with.  They arise as a result of certain kinds of
<br>
processing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How do you bring about that instant in wetware when all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the pieces come together at once?  This would require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extraordinary feat not just of construction but of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coordinating the synchronous assembly of perishable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; components in real time and bringing them together in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instant that is the deadline.   Doesn't seem &quot;easy&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>;-)  I meant easy in the philosophical sense.  Since
<br>
we are mechanical devices, the same applies to us as
<br>
to any other machine that you disassemble.  When a 
<br>
heart ceases to beat, indeed, a jolt may be necessary
<br>
to get it once again into the state wherein it begins
<br>
to operate all by itself.  An ideal brain brought to
<br>
a complete state of readiness one day may require a
<br>
similar jolt (perhaps merely along sensory nerves) to
<br>
get it going again.  But I believe that neurons can be
<br>
prepared in states such that they fire spontaneously.
<br>
<p>So one hardly need fear that one's brain would just &quot;sit&quot;
<br>
there if one were uploaded, copied, or teleported.  In
<br>
fact, the usual philosophical questions are pursued by
<br>
even adding in that all the original atoms are given
<br>
their original velocities as well.  Thus the brain
<br>
resumes its activity in a way that is physically completely
<br>
equivalent to the original.  It is disturbed less by this
<br>
operation (in principle) than it is by an annoying phone call.
