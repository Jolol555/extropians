<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20Boy%20Genius%20or%20Craft%20Idiot?">fauxever@sprynet.com</a> writes: At best, this is disingenuous.  At worst, the metaphorer becomes 
<br>
an &quot;enabler&quot; (to use the parlance of the new psychobabble).  Maybe that's one 
<br>
of the reasons United States denizens are far behind in intellectual maturity 
<br>
when it comes to confronting the material world - they're intellectually lazy 
<br>
due to the mollycoddling that's been done by those-who-know-better but insist 
<br>
on acting paternalistically.  We have groups like the Boy Scouts who 
<br>
outrightly discriminate against gays and nontheists.  We have a Christian 
<br>
fundamentalist president.  We have an attorney general who practices speaking in tongues.  
<br>
Is this not - at the very least - like, embarrasing?
<br>
<p>Olga,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But isn't it just embarrassing to have an &quot;intellectual&quot; that attacks 
<br>
everyone that thinks about there possibly being a God and using an exceedingly 
<br>
broad brush in doing so?  I thought being an intellectual was about using the 
<br>
intellect not about insulting everyone that remotely disagreed with you.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to then to do all of that on a subject where it is obvious you 
<br>
know nothing, &quot;Is this not - at the very least - like, embarrasing?&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Look I didn't get into this discussion to dump on Olga -- But when you 
<br>
get into any discussion of religion or religious people but sure you very 
<br>
pointedly include me out.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to John Ashcroft, he was a politician and public servant in my home 
<br>
state of Missouri for many years.  If I had to describe him in one short 
<br>
phrase it would be personally very competent, and totally unexciting.  Then he 
<br>
went to Washington and his opponents wanted to trash him totally overlooking the 
<br>
great kindness he had shown their party in a moment of distress.  They have 
<br>
returned kindness with character assassination.
