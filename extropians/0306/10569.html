</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However it's not clear to me how we'll bridge the gap between that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right now if I had infinite computing power and wanted to do it I'd

</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst nightmare - a new form of intelligence grown by evolution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessarily friendly to us.
</em><br>
<p>### I understand that Bayesian networks can be used to approximate the
<br>
behavior of both low-level motor/sensory neural networks, and high-level
<br>
semantic networks. Ben Goertzel is working on a system using probabilistic
<br>
inference on &quot;atoms&quot; (simple nodes) and &quot;maps&quot;(mapping of ensemble of atoms)
<br>
to achieve AGI. He believes that 3 to 5 years might be sufficient to build a
<br>
system capable of supervised learning with real-world input (e.g. scientific
<br>
journals). This is a bit like evolution but more amenable to oversight.
<br>
---------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Human-level computing power is going to be available to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; SingInst in about 15 years, so we can expect the recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; self-enhancement of the FAI to take off around that time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not convinced of this.  You're basing this on Moravec's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extrapolation of computing power necessary to replace the retina to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the whole brain?  I think that's a pretty rough model. The retina
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lacks much of the complexity of the cortex.
</em><br>
<p>### The estimate of the number of synapses and their firing rates is taken
<br>
directly from histological and neurophysiological analysis of the cortex.
<br>
The equivalence coefficient between computing power needed to emulate the
<br>
retina and the number of retinal synaptic events is also a direct
<br>
observation (subject to uncertainties of whether the retinal emulator is
<br>
really emulating the retina). The main leap of faith is applying the
<br>
FLOP/synapse equivalence coefficient from the retina to the cortex, but then
<br>
the increased complexity of the cortex is accounted for by the enumeration
<br>
of synapses. We have no reason to believe that the cortical synapses are
<br>
more computationally efficient that the retinal ones (they have similar
<br>
structures, similar evolutionary pressures for optimization). In fact, since
<br>
retinas have been around much longer than the prefrontal cortex, the former
<br>
might better optimized than the latter.
<br>
<p>In any case, while I am not a totally gung-ho near-term Singularity apostle,
<br>
I do think the UFAI should figure very high on Brett's and most of other
<br>
people's lists of future problems.
