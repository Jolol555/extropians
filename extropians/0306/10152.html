Damasio's work is fascinating and I am happy you mention it here. On a
<br>
somewhat unrelated note - I think we shouldn't draw too far-reaching
<br>
conclusions from it - abnormal functioning of the ventromedial cortex
<br>
correlates with poor performance in certain cognitive tests, and with the
<br>
absence of emotional reactions to some stimuli, that's true. Whether the
<br>
emotive qualia are a necessary part of cognitive performance, is not totally
<br>
clear. Until we learn *exactly* what the ventromedial cortex is doing, we
<br>
can't really tell if taking emotion out of cognition will always result in
<br>
problems in our type of cognitive architecture.

Subject: RE: Damasio (was Damiaso)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Hi Brett,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry I mangled Antonio Damasio's name.  Besides, one could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have reasonable read what I wrote as googlable, or being a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genuine reference.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here a description of what I was refering to:  Patients with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some kinds of brain damage behave exactly like normals on all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the usual tests.  But one kind of test showed what was going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on, and moreover, illustrated how our emotions are *needed*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (at present) in our thinking.  Here is an excerpt from my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; book:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; RISK TAKING: THE GAMBLING EXPERIMENTS  Chapter in Damasio's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Descartes Error&quot; page 213-215.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Another approach we took to testing the somalic-marker hypothesis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     made use of a task designed by my postdoctoral student.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Frustrated, as all researchers are, by the artificial nature of lost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     experimental neuropsychological tasks, he wanted to develop as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     lifelike a means as possible to assess decision-making performance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The clever set of tasks that he devised, and further refined in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     collaboration with Hanna Damasio and Steven Anderson, have come to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     known in our laboratory, predictably enough, as the &quot;Gambling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Experiments.&quot;  Overall, the setting for the experiments is colorful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a far cry from the boring manipulations of most other such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     situations.  Normals and patients alike enjoy it, and the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the investigation makes for amusing episodes. I recall the bulging
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     eyes and dropped jaw of a distinguished visitor who came to my office
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     after walking by the lab where an experiment was in progress.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &quot;There're people gambling in here!&quot; he informed me in a whisper.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     In the basic experiments the subject, known as the &quot;Player,&quot; sits in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     one of four decks or cards labeled A, B, C, and D.  The Player is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     given a loan of $5,000 (play money but looking like the real thing)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and told that the goal of the game he is about to play is to lose as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     little as possible of the loan and try to make as much extra money as
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     possible.  Play consists of turning cards, one at a lime, from any of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the four leeks, until the experimenter says to stop. The Player thus
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     does not know the total number of turns required to end the game.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The Player is told also that turning any and every card will result
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     in earning a sum money, and that every now and then turning some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     cards will result in both earning money and having to pay a sum of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     money to the experimenter.  Neither the amounts of gain or loss in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     any card, nor the cards' connection to a specific deck, nor the order
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     of their appearance is disclosed at the outset.  The amount to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     earned or paid with a given card is disclosed only after the card is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     turned.  No other instruction is provided.   The tally of how much
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     has been earned or lost at any point is not disclosed, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     subject is not allowed to keep written notes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The turning of any card in decks A and B pays a handsome $100, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     the turning of any card in decks C and D only pays $50.  Cards keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     being turned on any deck, and quite unpredictably, certain cards in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     decks A and B (the $100-paying decks) require the Player to make a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     sudden nigh payment, sometimes as much as $1,250.  Likewise, certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     cards in decks C and D (the $50-paying decks) also require a payment,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     but the sums are much smaller, less than $100 on the average.  These
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     undisclosed rules are never changed.  Unbeknownst to the Player, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     game will be terminated after 100 plays.  There e is no way for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Player to predict, at the outset, what will happen , and no way to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     keep in mind a precise tally of gains and losses as the game
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     proceeds.  Just as in life, where much of the knowledge by which we
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     live and by which we construct our adaptive future is doled out bit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     by bit, as experience accrues, uncertainty reigns.  Our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     knowledge---and the Player's ---is shaped by both the world with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     which we interact and by the biases inherent in our organism, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     example, our preferences for gain over loss, for reward over
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     punishment, for low risk over high risk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     What regular folds do in the experiment is interesting.  They begin
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     by sampling from all four decks, in search of patterns and clues.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     Then, more often than not, perhaps lured by the experience of high
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     reward from turning cards in the A and B decks, they show an early
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     preference for those decks.  Gradually,k however, within the first
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     thirty moves, they switch the preference to decks C and D.  In
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     general, they stick to this strategy until the end, although
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     self-professed high-risk players may resample decks A and B
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     occasionally, only to return to the apparently more prudent course of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     There is no way for players to carry out a precise calculation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     gains and losses.  Rather, bit by bit, they develop a hunch that some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     decks---namely, A and B---are more &quot;dangerous&quot; than others.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     might say they intuit that the lower penalties in decks C and D will
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     make them come out ahead in the long run, despite the smaller initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     gain.  I suspect that before and beneath the conscious hunch there is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     a nonconscious process gradually formulating a prediction for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     outcome of each move, and gradually telling the mindful player, at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     first softly but then ever louder, that punishment or reward is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     to strike *if* a certain move is indeed carried out.  In short, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     doubt that it is a matter of only fully conscious process, or only
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     fully nonconscious process.  It seems to take both types of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     processing for the well-tempered decision-making brain to operate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     The behavior of ventromedial frontal patients in this experiment was
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     most informative.  What they did in the card game resembled what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     often have done in real life since they sustained their brain lesion,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     and differed from what they would have done before the lesion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps this can now be found on-line somewhere too.  I'll look around,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I consider this experiment absolutely fundamental.
</em><br>
