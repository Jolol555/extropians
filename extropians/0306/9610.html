<em>&gt;&gt; It is worth remembering that the specific actions performed by Ms

<em>&gt;&gt; Stewart are referred to as &quot;crimes&quot; only because a statute
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; manipulation to use this term here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I guess I agree, but this could be said of any crimes.  They are only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;crimes&quot; because a statute classified them as such.  I don't think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is too misleading to refer to acts defined by statute to be illegal as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;crimes.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>### This is incorrect. There are crimes which have been recognized as such
<br>
by case law, without statutory help. Commonly, the crimes from case law will
<br>
be recognized as detestable by the average citizen. Many statutory crimes,
<br>
on the other hand, are actions which only thanks to political pressure are
<br>
being condemned, without recourse to the ethical intuitions of most humans,
<br>
and what's worse, without any consideration for advanced ethical theories,
<br>
merely because the wielder of power decided so.
<br>
<p>I do believe insider trading is one of such cases, and I fully agree with
<br>
LDC's opinion.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I thought the correct word here is something like &quot;invalid&quot; or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &quot;void&quot; but not illegal. It would be wrong to make it illegal.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Null&quot; and &quot;void&quot; and &quot;invalid&quot; all mean the same thing as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;unenforceable.&quot; The contract does not have to be enforced, but the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legislature hasn't defined such as a crime.  In discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transactions that have been defined by the legislature to be crimes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as fraud and insider trading, then the term &quot;illegal&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate.
</em><br>
<p>### My statement referred to your words: &quot;If the property turns out to be
<br>
substantially different than what the seller expected while the buyer knew
<br>
this and remained silent, the contract is illegal.&quot;. To the best of my
<br>
knowledge, the seller generally is not obliged by law to disclose such
<br>
information, except in certain types of situations. Therefore I am correct
<br>
in saying that such contract is not in general illegal. My statement did not
<br>
pertain to insider trading.
<br>
<p>Also, null is not the same as unenforceable.
