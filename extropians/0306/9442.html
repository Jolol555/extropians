<p>
I won't claim this is an original idea because I read about this on
<br>
Wired possibly a few years back and it was such a good idea I can't
<br>
believe it hasn't popped up yet.
<br>
<p>People spend a lot of time and money on clubbing, personal ads, online
<br>
and dating services, etc.. trying to to find the ideal mate or dating
<br>
partner.  They also spend a lot of time filling out job applications,
<br>
medical information requests in doctors offices and credit applications.
<br>
<p>Why not have a PDA with Wireless capability that hold all the data that
<br>
you wish to have known about yourself as well as a private section that
<br>
you could release to a querying source at your approval.
<br>
<p>You would have descriptions on the type of person and personal
<br>
attributes you were looking for attracted to.  When you walked into a
<br>
club or mall the device would send out the query and let you know if
<br>
there were any people there who fit your query and show you that
<br>
persons's profile.  If you wanted to meet them you could approve the
<br>
query and send them an instant message asking to meet them.
<br>
They of course could then view your data as well and decide if you were
<br>
worth talking to.
<br>
<p>Stores could also have the readers present where they accept credit
<br>
applications.
<br>
<p>They could be used in hospitals, and medical emergencies to give
<br>
paramedics and doctors critical medical information saving lives, etc.
<br>
<p>Most computerized dating services today do not gather nearly enough
<br>
information to determine if a person would be compatable or even
<br>
interesting to talk to.  It seems a shame that with all the 
<br>
time and money people spend trying to find someone interesting to be
<br>
with that the best we currently
<br>
can manage are smokey meat markets and judging each other on physical
<br>
appearance on the dance floor.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The Extropian payoff on this could great.  Higher compatability in
<br>
relationships leads to longer marriages, better child rearing more
<br>
efficient use of resources (2 together can live more cheaply than 2
<br>
seperately).  Not to mention all the lives saved due to medical
<br>
information and time and paper saved not having to fill out a form every
<br>
time you turn around.
