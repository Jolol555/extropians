<p>Reminder:

_______________
<br>
In a concrete basement at the University of Sydney, I sat in a chair
<br>
waiting to have my brain altered by an electromagnetic pulse. My forehead
<br>
was connected, by a series of electrodes, to a machine that looked
<br>
something like an old-fashioned beauty-salon hair dryer and was sunnily
<br>
described to me as a ''Danish-made transcranial magnetic stimulator.''
<br>
This was not just any old Danish-made transcranial magnetic stimulator,
<br>
however; this was the Medtronic Mag Pro, and it was being operated by
<br>
Allan Snyder, one of the world's most remarkable scientists of human
<br>
cognition.

Or neither?
<br>
<p>I presented at a conference with Allan Snyder and spent a fair bit of time
<br>
a few years ago listening to him on this theory. I met savants and experts
<br>
on the whole range of exceptionally (the politically correct term for
<br>
non-normal intelligences, whatever that may be) during that conference. I
<br>
am supposedly an expert on smart kids - hence my involvement. His theories
<br>
have been well documented in New Scientist and such like over the years.
<br>
<p>In my humble opinion his scientific credentials stand up well and his
<br>
skepticism of his own theories, and willingness to reject them if they
<br>
don't stand up to testing, lets me conclude he is a legitimate scientist,
<br>
working in the radical fringe areas. His confidence may be such that it
<br>
blinds him a bit - not sure on that one. He is very confident and
<br>
theatrical.
<br>
<p>Consequently he may lead to an incredible change in our understanding of
<br>
the human brain, or he might have an interesting theory which doesn't
<br>
stand up to testing. I think the jury is still out, but he's worth
<br>
following - he is never dull. Strange, but never dull.
<br>
<p>cheers,
