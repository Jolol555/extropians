Ah. I misunderstand things. Side effect.  :  )

Wow yeh. That's the main reason I think it's good people know what's 
<br>
possible and decide what they want to do about it. I wouldn't call it 
<br>
political though; I'd call it common sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

I know, that's why we keep having to go somewhere else...perhaps it just 
<br>
hasn't been far enough?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
I don't know for sure either. But I don't see it going on for much 
<br>
longer in secret, and I'd rather we knew before some a-hole starts 
<br>
messing with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When what we are up against is essentially fear 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
What we are up against is essentially fear, period.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;For me the brain is almost the holy of holies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I agree. Does that surprise you?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am confident
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that most of what makes me me is happening in there, but I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;regard it still a bit like a critical production system that is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;running on op code and I haven't got the source.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It _is_ accessible. Unfortunately not without a price most people don't 
<br>
wanna pay, ouch, ouch, -sentiment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For obvious
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reasons I want to tinker only very carefully.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
That guy's wise  :  )
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Research into the workings of brains though I am all for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Perhaps we can reengineer some of the source from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;op code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Well it would seem this is so.  It's not quite a fitting analogy but I 
<br>
can't think of one right now, sorry.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I particularly like the idea of being able to add 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;modules dynamically without having to go for an all or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;nothing upload.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I'm pretty sure this will happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is something more appealing about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being able to test the water with one toe and possibly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;retract it as opposed to jumping in in one great reckless
</em><br>
<em>&gt;plunge.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Ah -Learn to swim first? (Someone might push you in, after all)  :  )
<br>
Best,
