<p>Patriot Act of 2001 casts wide net
<br>
By Frank J. Murray
<br>
Published June 15, 2003
<br>
<p>Amara,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much.  I took a fast glance at the article you referred 
<br>
to us.  Consider the source in this case.  The Washington Times is the most 
<br>
right wing large newspaper I know of -- yet it is a respectable organ in that 
<br>
it is truthful and well reasoned.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all this is an example of why I am not afraid of the Patriot 
<br>
Act, RICO, nor of Joe McCarthy type individuals of either the right nor the 
<br>
left.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our country has a long history of occasionally attempting to do 
<br>
something that is beyond the pale and then having the citizenry or the courts 
<br>
overturn the government.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Washington Times leads in speaking out against the abuses large or 
<br>
small in the Patriot Act.  Eventually to the extent it is a bad law they and 
<br>
others will get the law struck down.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;According to the reports I am hearing RICO is being brought to rein.  
<br>
Eisenhower slapped down Joe McCarthy.  The courts overturned FDR's treatment 
<br>
of the Japanese Americans.  The courts overturned Lincoln on Habeas Corpus.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only time I know of the system didn't work was with Andrew 
<br>
(Chicken Snake to the Cherokee) Jackson.  People forget today that the Cherokee took 
<br>
Jackson to the Supreme Court over his grabbing of their land and won.  Jackson 
<br>
disobeyed the Supreme Court decision and forcibly removed the Cherokee with 
<br>
his Army.

<br>
<p>BTW, in case Indian stuff interests you.  General Custer was known as Iron 
<br>
Butt to the Indians.  They admired his endurance in the saddle.
