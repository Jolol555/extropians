MMB sayeth:
<br>
&lt;&lt;This seems to presuppose that you can accurately model the thought processes of the putative sim writer[s]/editor[s]/operator[s]. Your blanket claim, if I understand you correctly, that there can be no good reason, is 
<br>
a bold one. You haven't supported it in any way as far as I can see. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>(Intoning Frank Oz's Yoda) Yes, Bold, am I yes!
<br>
<p>I will say if the author-programmer-editor(s) are using the pain/ pisery index as a motivator or modifer; they done way too well in my opinion.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Lately, my favorite explanation for the Problem of Evil (shamelessly stolen 
<br>
from somebody) is the conjecture that /God is _malevolent_, but _only 80% effective_/.  No, I'm not serious when I countenance this notion. I only do it to be more amusing to...whom it may concern. :)&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ya know, Tipler had the idea that all quantum universes-based on random action-would provide all manner of good and evil. In essence God, the Great Programmer has no choice in the rolling of the dice, but must roll them none the less. (hmmm!)
<br>
<p>Seems like we don't have any disagreement, except perhaps on whether such a simulation, would be so technically flawed as to induce massively pain, apparently, randomly; yet be so meticulous that its brightest inhabitants cannot prove that its all an illusion (not meaning to get Buddhistic on anyone's buttocks).
<br>
<p>Better to just say this is a Creation, possibly one of a Plenitude. If this is just a Sim, lets find the controls and fix her up. If this is a creation, let's find the controls and fix her up. My sense of it is, man's teleological purpose, is to spawn descendents who will find the controls and fix her up. The answer is the same, the question, as I ask it, is the same. The context, Live or Mermorex, to quote the ancient commericial, is the central, but unimportant issue, me thinks.
<br>
<p>Munkinds Purpose: Look for the F^%CK*ng controls! ò¿ó
