<p>### Wow, I have discussed this idea with Eugen Leitl a couple of years ago,
<br>
and we thought it could be done soon. This is so cool. If progress keeps at
<br>
this speed, with the nanodot-labeled antibodies which are already available,
<br>
it will be possible to map all the synaptic strengths in a brain sample in a
<br>
few years (once we know all the proteins that define synaptic strength).
<br>
<p>Talking about progress:
<br>
<p>There was recently an article in &quot;Neuron&quot; (Neuron, Vol. 38, 547-554, May 22,
<br>
2003,) about the cognitive performance of Alzheimer's patients who received
<br>
an anti-amyloid vaccine and developed an adequate antibody response. Turns
<br>
out that their cognitive decline was totally arrested, while the controls
<br>
lost 6 points on MMSE, which I can tell you, makes a huge difference. While
<br>
this is not the cure for Alzheimer's, it could mean a major improvement over
<br>
existing approaches.
<br>
<p>Our prospects for the future are getting better every day.
