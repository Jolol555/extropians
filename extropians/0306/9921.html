Kevin Freels stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;The only IT money left will be for those who design and implement the new
<br>
technologies as they are developed, and those who market and sell it. It
<br>
only makes sense that your only choice if you wish to stay in IT is to
<br>
increase your education in the field, or move into a sales position.
<br>
Of course, when AI is developed, maybe the software will design and sell
<br>
itself&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Kevin, I am indeed continuing my education in computing, but I also realize 
<br>
that no matter how much I learn and improve, it is not my expertise that really 
<br>
matters, but rather the mentality of corporations that send jobs overseas, in 
<br>
order to squeeze costs. There will always be someone somewhere who will know 
<br>
more, and work amazingly cheaper.
<br>
<p>Regarding sales positions,  the lead story of the Wall Street Journal on 
<br>
Weds, June 11 2003,  was the trend in corporate thinking is to eliminate higher 
<br>
paid people from jobs and replace them with lower paid workers. According to the 
<br>
article, this is apparently not illegal to do so. This occurred at Circuit 
<br>
City, nationally. What I sense from some of the people on this list is a &quot;trust 
<br>
in capitalism, not reason&quot; and judging by the behaviors of the corporations, 
<br>
this seems to be the case. 
<br>
<p>This may be a self-correcting problem, in the sense that when there are not 
<br>
enough people to afford to purchase goods and services, a lot of the 
<br>
stockholders will demand retribution on the boards of directors, for the decline in the 
<br>
value of their stocks, as the economy tanks. Call it  The Darwinian Principle 
<br>
in action. What is left of the United States after this process completes is 
<br>
another story.
