</em><br>
<em>&gt; Scientific Anomalies and Other Provocative Phenomena: An Annotated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Outline of 6,000 Entries
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Compiled by William R. Corliss
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The book pictured above is my first attempt to map the universe of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific anomalies in a compact format....
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure how much of a &quot;review&quot; this was since it seems to be
<br>
written by the author!  But I've had one of Corliss's books for years,
<br>
Unexplained Natural Phenomena, and it is fascinating reading.  He's
<br>
combed the literature of the last few hundred years for peculiarities,
<br>
odd sightings, bizarre events, etc.
<br>
<p>The disturbing thing is that he presents each topic in order from rather
<br>
unusual but believable events, through downright strange, to utterly
<br>
impossible.  It's obvious that many or most of the extreme observations
<br>
are mistakes, lies, exaggerations and tall tales.  But there is a huge
<br>
gray area between the believable and unbelievable, and it is impossible
<br>
to say where to draw the line.  Ultimately the lesson is that the world
<br>
is not as black and white as we think it is, that it is not so easy to
<br>
distinguish the possible from the impossible.
<br>
<p>As Corliss mentions, he's published 37 books in this general area, so
<br>
I'd imagine that one is much like another.  If you do run across one in a
<br>
used book store, it's probably worth reading if you like mind-stretching
<br>
material.  It's also great for those with short attention spans as you
<br>
can open it up anywhere, read a few pages and usually find something
<br>
interesting.
<br>
