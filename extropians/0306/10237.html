<p><em>&gt; &gt; Well, we should inspect the tiny kernel of truth in such charges,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if any such truth there be.  For example, I had difficulty *while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the war was on* (a brief time indeed), not thinking of American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dissenters as treasonous---I even provided definitions of &quot;treason&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This, IMO, *should* give rise to sincere questions about patriotism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and loyalty, and what roles they truly ought to play, according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the visions of the various posters.  Thankfully, such discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have taken place, (and I'm even still interested in the topic, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps that should warrant a separate thread).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have marked patriotism and loyalty as &quot;considered harmful&quot; since before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the age of sixteen.  I have seen nothing within the recent debacle on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropian mailing list that leads me to reconsider this.  &quot;Patriotism 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; switches on, brain switches off&quot; appears to be the rule.
</em><br>
<p>Surely that's an exaggeration!  Many extremely thoughtful and
<br>
calmly, deliberately rational people partly extend the notion
<br>
of self to cover larger groups, and this often manifests as
<br>
loyalty and, on the level of nations, patriotism.
<br>
<p>Now you can readily see the evolutionary sources of such
<br>
conduct; so I infer that the above is a personal statement.
<br>
You might say if there are other groups, possibly a family,
<br>
possibly a group of friends or associates, that you have such
<br>
regard for.  It's not entirely a matter of rationality:  notice
<br>
how you react when a statement is made concerning your own
<br>
integrity or past wisdom on some matters close to your heart.
<br>
I doubt that you wish to claim that you always remain an
<br>
objective observer when personal matters are concerned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I shall side with the right whether it be this country or another.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Patriotism cannot help, can only hinder, in computing this.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America is right then America is right whether I had been born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American or French.  If America is wrong then America is wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether I had been born British or Iraqi.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I think that's right.  But this doesn't cut as close to the
<br>
issues as it could in my opinion.  Namely, you won't find anyone
<br>
here arguing that America is right if they think that America is
<br>
wrong.  If you don't truly know what it's like to have loyalty to
<br>
a group, I'm hardly going to be able to explain it to you.  (You
<br>
may indeed be an extreme case.)
<br>
<p>I have seen people who are otherwise not engaged with any group
<br>
exhibit loyalty to &quot;the Extropians&quot;.  All people, I think, are
<br>
wired at a level immune from memes to have a team to root for
<br>
(just think of teenagers and their peer group or sports fans
<br>
and their favorite teams)---it's just a matter of degree.  Again,
<br>
it's important to realize that this did not occur by chance in
<br>
the evolutionary heritage of the human race; it has had survival value.
<br>
<p>The question for most of us will turn out to be how appropriate
<br>
is it at this point in history or within a large powerful
<br>
Western nation to try to hold in check one's native disposition?
<br>
Or conversely, with those not well-endowed by nature with a team
<br>
spirit, how right (as well as prudent) is it to now embrace a
<br>
people or a cause that has had a good track record?
<br>
<p>Either way, of course, it's almost impossible if it's not in
<br>
accord with the way you are.
<br>
