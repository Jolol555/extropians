<p><em>&gt; Personally, I've been finding continuing thinking on the

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Axiom: I am.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tenuous hypothesis 1: I have sensory input implying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other stuff, and so it  is too.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tenuous hypothesis 2: I am part of the set of other stuff.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (much deduction, investigation, leading to negation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concept of conscious self; self is an illusion, &quot;I&quot; am just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a pattern of information)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find that if I take Tenuous Hypotheses 1 &amp; 2 as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axioms, I produce the result:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Result: I am not.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how you get to your result from 1 and 2.
<br>
<p>Why not posit:  &quot;I&quot; whatever &quot;I&quot; am, am party a self referential
<br>
processes or even set of processes. The &quot;I&quot; may not be a singular
<br>
process it may be a plurality. Perhaps some of these processes
<br>
contained in what we term crudely call the &quot;self&quot; are recursively
<br>
aware of the other processes in the &quot;self&quot;.
<br>
<p>We don't doubt we are multicellular though we talk of having
<br>
a body. Perhaps consciousness is a sets of precesses and to
<br>
refer to the self as though it is a singular thing is to make a similar
<br>
mistake as to assume our body is a single thing. The level of
<br>
abstraction at the body level and the &quot;self&quot; level losses too much
<br>
detail. Maybe.

<p><p><em>&gt; By my original axiom, I now have A and ~A. I've just flushed reality down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the toilet. What is existence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't fault the materialist viewpoint, because I can't support the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

else.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course it is correct that we do not yet know as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; we should on brain and consciousness. At the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the point that I am trying to make is independent of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; particular mechanism of consciousness:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Question A: does the uploaded copy of person X wake up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; thinking and feeling that (s)he is X? Does (s)he feel continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; with X (going to sleep - waking up)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes and yes. Assuming, as we have been, that the upload works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Indeed the test of whether the upload has worked is likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; does Xprime think (s)he is X and does everyone else relate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Xprime as X.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This is a scientific question that can be answered with a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; experiment: just ask the uploaded copy of X. I assume the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; answer depends on the details of a uploading technology, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; how much and what kind of information it is able to copy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; restore. I think this technology is a few decades away at least,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; but it seems reasonable to think that it will be developed sooner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; or later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, the uploading technology is unlikely to be *built* until it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be designed. Seems we are unlikely to be satisfied with the design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; until we have a better understanding of what we take for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; and the &quot;self&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Question B: assuming that the answer to Question A is yes (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; uploaded copy feels that (s)he is X), is (s)he REALLY X?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; This does not look like a scientific question, since its formulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is such that it cannot be verified or falsified.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Agreed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem:  There are certain propositions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that are true that cannot be proven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you think the consciousness of any other person you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is a scientifically veriable hypothesis? I think it can only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be inferred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do you think your own is even to you? I think it can only be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; assumed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Without assuming it you have *no base* from which to formulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientific questions or any other types of questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course we still tend to feel uneasy: when it comes to survival,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; everyone is the Most Selfish Individual. We cannot help thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that Question B matters very much. The answer that I choose is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it does not matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A leap of faith?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I can accept as a continuation of my current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; identity any conscious being who thinks that he is a continuation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of my current identity. I could not go to sleep if I could not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; accept this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A leap of faith for peace of mind?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Brett:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because I don't *know* enough about how my consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the experience of self-hood manifests to assume that it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; persist completely decoupled from a matter substrate for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; length of time. My current thinking is no substrate means no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conscious processing (or unconscious processing either). No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness process means no self concept process. In short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I assume that no brain means a discontinuation of me because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems prudent to do so.
