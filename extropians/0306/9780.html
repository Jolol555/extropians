<p>IANAP.  With that in mind, my understanding goes something like this:  The 
<br>
instrument is attracted to where the star's projected position is, 
<br>
according to the star's velocity in the past.  This is because of the way 
<br>
the star's velocity bends the potential well generated by the star.  If 
<br>
you're one light-minute away, you are not attracted to where the star is 
<br>
now.  You're attracted to where, one minute ago, the star would have been 
<br>
in one minute, had it continued on at the same velocity it had one minute 
<br>
ago, from the position it had one minute ago.  (I'm not quite sure if 
<br>
acceleration is supposed to be taken into account as well, or maybe it was 
<br>
some other property of the star's behavior aside from or in addition to 
<br>
the velocity, but I think this is roughly how it goes...)  This is quite 
<br>
distinguishable, behaviorally and experimentally, from an infinite 
<br>
propagation speed.  It also produces the same behavior if we shift 
<br>
reference frames to regard the instrument as moving and the star as 
<br>
motionless.
