<p>US TROOPS ADMIT SHOOTING IRAQI CIVILIANS
<br>
<a href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/content_objectid=13087653_method=fu">http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/allnews/content_objectid=13087653_method=fu</a>

<br>
<p>An interesting article, and disturbing if true.  However, no indication
<br>
is made that this is the official US policy, and the simple manner is
<br>
was titled &quot;US TROOPS ADMIT SHOOTING IRAQI CIVILIANS&quot; and the first
<br>
sentence &quot;American troops today admitted they routinely gun down Iraqi
<br>
civilians - some of whom are entirely innocent&quot; should cause some pause.
<br>
Both of these statements should have been preceeded by a qaulified, for
<br>
instance 'some' i.e. &quot;SOME US TROOPS ADMIT SHOOTING IRAQI CIVILIANS&quot; and
<br>
&quot;Some American troops today admitted...&quot;  Leaving that out makes a very
<br>
clear distinction harder to draw.  More accurately the article should be
<br>
titled &quot;TWO US TROOPS ADMITTING SHOOTING IRAQI CIVILIANS&quot;  Was this
<br>
official policy? or are thes acting a manner that is uncondoned by the
<br>
coalition forces?  And, more importantly, it is clearly easy to imply
<br>
certain things an add an spin to an article withouth lying, this is
<br>
easily accomplished by quoting out of context.  
<br>
<p>For example, the interview may have asked 
<br>
<p>&quot;Whats it like over there&quot;
<br>
<p>To which Sergeant First Class John Meadows responded 
<br>
<p>&quot;&gt; &quot;You can't distinguish between who's trying to kill you and 
<br>
<em>&gt; who's not,&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>The next question a reporter might as then would be
<br>
<p>&quot;Have you ever killed any civilians?&quot;
<br>
<p>To which John could have responded
<br>
<p>&quot;Its possible, you don't really know for sure every time, and some
<br>
instances may occur where you don't have time to sit down and analyze
<br>
whether a person is a civlian or plan clothed combatant out to kill you.
<br>
And in the heat of the battle, making such clear decisions could be made
<br>
even more difficult.&quot;
<br>
<p>To which the reporter might have responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;Oh Can you give an an example of a situation where something like that
<br>
might occur?&quot;
<br>
<p>To which John may have responded
<br>
<p>&quot;Like when a wall of people are approaching you, some armed and some
<br>
not.  Like, the only way to get through s*** like that was to
<br>
concentrate on getting through it by killing as many people as you can,
<br>
people you know are trying to kill you. Killing them first and getting
<br>
home&quot;
<br>
<p>Then the reporter made a mental note &quot;Ah, American Troops admit shooting
<br>
Iraqi Civilians&quot; will make a great headline, and I can use this quote!
<br>
<p>I am not saying this is what happened, but I don't think there are *any*
<br>
news stories of this manner from either idealogy that does not
<br>
sensationalize, twist, or otherwise quote out of context, so please keep
<br>
this in mind while reading.
<br>
<p>If these soldiers actions are not condoned, and they admit to shooting
<br>
civilians when they had no reason to feel threatened by them, they
<br>
should be punished, severely.  However, I note in the above quote that
<br>
the interviewee said &quot;you know they are trying to kill you&quot;  If they are
<br>
civilians, and they are trying to kill you, you can certainly defend
<br>
yourself.  The fact that he said this could mean that he told a story
<br>
and was asked question similar to what I hypothesize, conversely, it
<br>
could mean that he thinks 'them' (as in all Iraqis) are out to kill him,
<br>
but which of these is a more reasonable opinion that we should
<br>
reasonably suspect an average soldier of holding?
<br>
<p>Each of the statements of this article viewed in this late can become
<br>
suspect, yet the first line in the article insists that &quot;American troops
<br>
today admitted they routinely gun down Iraqi civilians - some of whom
<br>
are entirely innocent.&quot;
<br>
<p>Where is the 'Routine' admission of gunning down Iraqi civilians?  No
<br>
where in the article does a soldier say 'Yeah, we routinely gun down
<br>
civilians'
<br>
<p>Consider also the reporter says &quot;Describing the scene during combat
<br>
Richardson admitted shooting injured soldiers and leaving them to die.&quot;
<br>
So, during combat, he shot the enemy, and then left them to die?  This
<br>
does not seem to be odd behavior for actually being in combat.
<br>
<p>The latter two statements are much more difficult to reconcile, but I
<br>
would be interested in hearing what these two soldiers have to say of
<br>
this 'interview'.  In either case, suggesting that the killing of
<br>
civilians was routine and leaving the implication open that [all]
<br>
American troops admit shooting civilians instead of [two] is egregious
<br>
and dishonest reporting.  But I am sure less critical people whos
<br>
idealogy this reinforces will be all to ready to accept everything it
<br>
says.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
