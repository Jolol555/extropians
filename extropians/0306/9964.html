<p>Well, from a theological point of view the movie *is* troublesome, in
<br>
fact more troublesome than the first. After all, Neo is shown as a
<br>
saviour that both has human passions (not so bad; Islam acknowledges
<br>
that Mohammed liked cats and was buried beneath the bed of his favorite
<br>
wife where he died) and is fundamentaly deluded (*very* bad). After all,
<br>
if saviours can be unwitting agents for the archons keeping us
<br>
imprisoned (the gnostic position taken by the Matrix movies), then what
<br>
about Jesus or Mohammed?  Gnosticism is something that tends to worry
<br>
traditionalists. 
<br>
<p>Of course, the reasons are likely also a dislike for violent american
<br>
movies, distaste for the erotic scenes, the strong women, the message of
<br>
rebellion against authority and so on. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Looks like papers by Nick Bostrom, books by Damien Broderick,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Are they widely read? Are they likely to affect somebody? Those are
<br>
issues censors tend to think about. Bring these works up and the censors
<br>
would likely find them disagreeable, but otherwise they would
<br>
concentrate on more pressing menaces like MTV. Fortunately there are
<br>
cultural developments that might break through anyway:

<p>IMHO rock videos are currently more important for liberating the Arab 
<br>
world than transhumanist treatises. Their day will come later.
