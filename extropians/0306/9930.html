<p>No, we did not benefit &quot;wildly and disporportionately&quot; unless we happened to 
<br>
be in a company with a good IPO and cashed out at the right time.  General 
<br>
salaries simply were not that high.  Some consulting for trendy stuff got 
<br>
pretty out there for a time but that was about it.  Whereas now, now people 
<br>
who have trained and worked hard in this field for many years have been out 
<br>
of work a damn long time.  Not low wages even, no wages.  This is not a 
<br>
simple normal market readjustment.  The economy was reamed and many IT folks 
<br>
are bearing a goodly share of the brunt.     If economies have cycles that 
<br>
throw millions of the highly trained out of work for many months then those 
<br>
cycles damn well need to be fixed!     Saying after the fact, in an economy 
<br>
that goes out of its way to create as much personal debt as possible, that 
<br>
people should learn saving, is quite cold.

<p>What is wrong with people losing everyting they own through no fault of their 
<br>
own and despite great work ethic, skills, knowledge and so on?   What is 
<br>
wrong with a world that is largely capricious economically?
