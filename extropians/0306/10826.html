<p>_Scientific Anomalies and Other Provocative Phenomena: An Annotated Outline of
<br>
6,000 Entries_
<br>
<p>Compiled by William R. Corliss
<br>
<p>The book pictured above is my first attempt to map the universe of scientific
<br>
anomalies in a compact format.  The quotation below from page 1 details the
<br>
book's background and objectives.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past four decades, I have amassed a collection of roughly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;50,000 articles and shorter items from the scientific literature.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each was selected because it seemed to challenge a paradigm of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;science or was in some way &quot;provocative&quot; in that it suggested all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the elements in Nature's grand scheme.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although I have already published 37 books detailing over 2,000
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;scientific anomalies and &quot;provocative&quot; phenomena, the cataloging
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;task is barely half done.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this midpoint of the effort, it seems worthwhile to stand back
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and look at what has been accomplished and what mysteries of the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;natural world have not yet been cataloged.  Therefore, in this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;book, I spread out in print the vast scope of scientific anomalies,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;as seen in a deep, eclectic, one-person search of the literature
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of science.  I include those phenomena already identified in my
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;previous books and the many more that merit space in my files but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which have not yet been fully analyzed.  It should not surprise
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;anyone that this Outline contains about 6,000 entries, all of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which remain unexplained to my satisfaction or which, at the very
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;least, I find very curious and engaging.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Outline is one person's attempt to grasp better the full scope
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the cosmos by mapping its terra incognitae.  Hopefully, it will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be useful and stimulating to others.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My major objectives are these:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The compilation of a list of scientific phenomena worth of further
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;attention and research;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The presentation of a &quot;first look&quot; at the *entire* spectrum of what
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have found anomalous, provocative, and exciting in science (It is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a very large realm as you shall see.); and
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* The provision, via a menu-type index, of a guide to my many
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;already-published Catalogs and Handbooks of anomalies and curiosities.
<br>
<p>As for specific content, the six disciplines already represented by Catalogs
<br>
and/or Handbooks (Archeology, Astronomy, Biology, Geology, Geophysics, and
<br>
Psychology) are briefly recapitulated and updated in separate chapters.  The
<br>
Biology chapter; in addition to humans, other mammals, and birds; includes
<br>
fish, reptiles, amphibians, and arthropods.  There is a separate chapter on
<br>
Chemistry &amp; Physics and another short one on Miscellany.
<br>
<p>The 6,000 entries are often expanded by interpretative annotations, examples
<br>
in telegraphic form, and cross references.
<br>
<p>The book's statistics prove that it is a bargain for the great mass of
<br>
unique material it contains.
<br>
<p>300 pp., large 7x10 format, 244 illustrations, only $17.95p
<br>
<p>Five of the 244 figures now follow [not shown].
