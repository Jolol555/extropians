<p><em>&gt; I watched it, the watched it again a second time while I recorded it. It's 
</em><br>
great to have something out there that explains the evolutionary history of 
<br>
human beings in laymen's terms. I had 6 people (all of whom think I am nuts) 
<br>
watch this. If there is one thing they all got out of it, it was the fact 
<br>
that Neanderthal man is NOT our ancestor, but an entirely different species! 
<br>
I am starting to check around right now, but it seems to me that the common 
<br>
misconception is that we descended from Neanderthal man. After viewing this 
<br>
program, all 6 of these people are more inclined to listen to what I have to 
<br>
say about evolution vs. creation. They simply had no idea how it worked! 
<br>
<em>&gt; Until seeing this program, one of my friends (and possibly more) actually 
</em><br>
thought that man descended from what is, for lack of a better word, modern 
<br>
ape. Once again, the Discovery channel has opened a few minds!!!!!!
<br>
<em>&gt; Three cheers for the Discovery Channel!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I also enjoyed what I saw of the program, and plan to eventually watch it in 
<br>
its entirety.  However, I would not take what they say as carved in stone 
<br>
truth.  Every week some grand revelation issues forth from the mills of the 
<br>
press via some study. But many of those studies are flawed.  Truth is always 
<br>
being revised, and it seems that we have a short memory considering how often 
<br>
studies that are promoted as carved in stone truth are refuted a few years 
<br>
later.  Evolutionary biology is great stuff, but I would not be surprised if 
<br>
what we saw in the aforementioned TV show is revised with a decade or 2.
