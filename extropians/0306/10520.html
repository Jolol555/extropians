<em>&gt; Sure there is only one total explanation, but are you Eliezer S. 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; them all to the world in one grand revelation?  We are rich, in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; have fallen for the &quot;Dream of Autarky&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>Yes, as a matter of fact that does happen to be a major dream of mine. 
<br>
That applies after the Singularity, though, not before.
<br>
<p>This aside, whether many people or a few people are working out their 
<br>
areas of the One Explanation, my point is that I would not strive for 
<br>
modularity in my maps unless I thought that reality itself was modular 
<br>
with respect to the thing I was mapping.  This idea of building a 
<br>
philosophy that is modular, where you can stand regardless of who else 
<br>
falls... it may help on public relations but how can it possibly be 
<br>
*right*?  Isn't this a sign that one has fallen into &quot;mere 
<br>
philosophizing&quot;, unconnected from the rest of the universe?  As Dan 
<br>
Fabulich put it:

<em>&gt;&gt; Nature doesn't work that way in constructing explanations; how could it

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My first response: &quot;I would least expect to get this kind of argument
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>When I am *designing* something, then yes, I will try and make the design 
<br>
modular because that is a good heuristic for humans to use.  When I am 
<br>
trying to *discover* something I will not try to make the *explanation* 
<br>
modular unless I think the *reality* is modular - the purpose of the map 
<br>
is to correspond to the territory, after all.  If you can build a theory 
<br>
that's modular, just because you want it to be modular, doesn't that mean 
<br>
you're inventing something rather than discovering something?  Is this not 
<br>
the very essence of &quot;mere philosophization&quot;, building maps unconstrained 
<br>
by territory?
<br>
<p>If I am an interdependent programmer, I will try to write modular code and 
<br>
use other people's modular code.  But if I am an interdependent explainer, 
<br>
I will try to constrain other people's explanations and be constrained by 
<br>
other people's explanations.  It is a very different task than 
<br>
programming.  I can clearly see the *memetic* benefits to having theories 
<br>
that are small and modular and persuasive whether or not you have the 
<br>
background in a particular field, and whether or not you accept the 
<br>
majority or the contrarian view, and so on, but is this not directly 
<br>
opposed to the way things really are?  Doesn't it mean that you are just 
<br>
making stuff up, in which case you may as well make stuff up that's easy 
<br>
to package for sale?  &quot;This is why I am not an academic&quot;; because emergent 
<br>
effects in academia produce forces on the map that do not correspond to 
<br>
forces on the territory.
<br>
<p>Robin Hanson and I both seem to agree that, given the facts as we know 
<br>
them, including contrarian facts, the best move is, in fact, to be 
<br>
rational.  Fine.  *With* this fact and the real reasons for it understood, 
<br>
we can go over the web of interdependencies and see if there are 
<br>
generalizable arguments that can be modularized away from correct but 
<br>
controversial beliefs.  And indeed there are; for example, &quot;rationality is 
<br>
a guard against unknown unknowns&quot; - if you adopt the perspective of 
<br>
someone who doesn't know about the Singularity, then the Singularity is 
<br>
exactly the sort of unknown that rationality is meant to guard against, 
<br>
and many other similar possibilities would qualify as well.  Or if you 
<br>
adopt the perspective of someone who doesn't know about evolutionary 
<br>
psychology, then it turns out that without this tremendous complex 
<br>
background in evolutionary psychology and game theory and all these other 
<br>
highly rational disciplines, there's no good way to calculate whether to 
<br>
be rational; and the generalizable argument here is, &quot;If you're not 
<br>
rational, how can you figure out whether or not to be rational?&quot;  So there 
<br>
are generalizable, modular arguments, but these modular arguments have to 
<br>
*follow* the consilient theory.  If your map is accurate than you should 
<br>
not be surprised if it starts looking consilient, frequently contrarian, 
<br>
and interdisciplinary; that is just reflecting the territory.
<br>
<p>I am sympathetic to the need to come up with modular *arguments* for good 
<br>
ideas - stretching back the inferential chain to the knowledge base of a 
<br>
general audience.  Even here there are, in my opinion, strong constraints; 
<br>
one must come up with valid arguments, meaning arguments that you yourself 
<br>
currently take into account as evidence.  The task is not persuasion or 
<br>
rationalization, but finding a subset of the valid arguments that are easy 
<br>
to explain, accessible to many disciplines, requiring a minimum amount of 
<br>
new material as prerequisite.  This is the task of building a paved road 
<br>
down which anyone may travel - a concrete highway of strong, obvious 
<br>
evidence.  But while we are blazing the first dirt trail and trying to 
<br>
discover where the path *goes*, we must have a sharp distinction between 
<br>
forces that constrain human argument, and forces that constrain the 
<br>
territory and its map.
