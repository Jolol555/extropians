<p>We have our share of right-wing fascists, and communist-from-russia

death count, but high emotional impact.

</em><br>
<p>Fair enough. I'm not saying that everyone should sing in choir the same
<br>
song. Just that different opinions, as opposite as they are, should not
<br>
single out each other as the &quot;enemy&quot;. Most people in the US thinks that
<br>
Bernard's thoughts are contrary to the US interests. A small percentage
<br>
thinks that it would be better for the US to follow his thoughts. (and a
<br>
bigger percentage outside the US thinks that too :-))
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;There are people, who would like to see the nation-state of America
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;there are vicious empty-headed people of the Right, with their white robes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hoods who advocate America's destruction (The South shall rise again!), there
</em><br>
<em>&gt;have been vicious, empty-headed people of the Left, who seem to wish the worst
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have been taken so seriously in Europe. But then most Europeans appear
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to enjoy what they say and agree with them, yes?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know, since very few people here know who Vidal his, or what
<br>
Chomsky writes about. If they were really advocating the end of the
<br>
US under the cover of leftist speech, I could somewhat agree with
<br>
labelling them as anti-US. But I doubt it.

<p>Ciao,
