</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What about where X = &quot;This drug will relieve your illness&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, even then.  Because, what I think you're arguing here is that, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this case, we should believe X, and hence, we shouldn't believe (1), which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just says ~X.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There may be a problem with the use of the word &quot;we&quot;. In your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example &quot;we&quot; could be the same person, in mine the people it is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doctor that makes statement X. And note he says &quot;will&quot; not &quot;might&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to maximise the patients confidence and give the placebo the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chance. Yet it is the patient (another person) who believes X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and in 40% of cases actually benefits from that belief (but not for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reasons he thinks) but in 60% of cases he does not benefit.
</em><br>
<p>Well, first off, I think it's important to note that my argument isn't a
<br>
proof that _lying_ is wrong.  If you say that the doctor should lie in
<br>
this case, well, we can discuss that, but it has no bearing on my argument
<br>
that &quot;we&quot; shouldn't believe *.
<br>
<p>But to clarify the point about &quot;we&quot;, you can replace &quot;we&quot; in * with any
<br>
particular individual in this scenario; which ever individual you choose,
<br>
THAT individual shouldn't believe their version of *.  Let's call the
<br>
doctor Alice and the patient Bob.  What I'll try to show is that Alice
<br>
shouldn't believe * for Alice, which says that &quot;~X &amp; Alice should believe
<br>
X&quot;, and Bob shouldn't believe * for Bob, which says that &quot;~X &amp; Bob should
<br>
believe X.&quot;
<br>
<p>Starting with Dr. Alice, clearly, she shouldn't believe X, (even if,
<br>
perhaps, she should tell Bob X,) and she shouldn't believe that she
<br>
*should* believe X.  If she shouldn't believe &quot;Alice should believe X&quot;,
<br>
then she shouldn't believe &quot;~X &amp; Alice should believe X&quot;, which is * for
<br>
Alice.  So Alice shouldn't believe *.
<br>
<p>Next, let's consider Bob.  Let's suppose, for the sake of argument, that
<br>
you're right that Bob should believe X.  (Perhaps if only because Dr.
<br>
Alice told him so.)  Well, this is the case I discussed earlier: if Bob
<br>
should believe X, then he shouldn't believe that ~X.  If he shouldn't
<br>
believe that ~X, he shouldn't believe that &quot;~X &amp; Bob should believe X&quot;,
<br>
which is * for Bob.  So Bob shouldn't believe * either.
<br>
<p>Of course, if I don't let you suppose that Bob should believe X, if I
<br>
demand that Bob SHOULDN'T believe X for some reason, then my argument that
<br>
Bob shouldn't believe * looks just like the argument that Alice shouldn't
<br>
believe *.  So it doesn't matter what you think Bob should think about X,
<br>
he DEFINITELY shouldn't believe *.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are potential benefits in believing white lies told to us by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others and that being the case they may be being ethical to do so.
</em><br>
<p>If so, then all I need to prove is that you (the individual) shouldn't
<br>
believe that they are lies: you should believe that they are *not* lies.
<br>
And you shouldn't believe that you should believe that they're lies.
<br>
<p>Of course, that means that there's no proposition P which you should
<br>
believe to be a lie, but you should also believe.  That means that if you
<br>
think you should believe in something, then you should believe it; you
<br>
shouldn't believe it's a lie at all.  So you shouldn't believe that there
<br>
are any lies that you should believe.
<br>
<p>The argument is slippery, but, I think, it is correct.
