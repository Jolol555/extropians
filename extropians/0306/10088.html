<p><em>    &gt;freedom of religion is gauranteed under the Koran
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Like all sacred texts the Koran is full of contradictions, if you look
<br>
<p>hard enough you can find some nice warm inoffensive platitudes in it,
<br>
<p>but I don't see how you can say it GUARANTEES religious freedom
<br>
<p>when these gems are also in the book:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;Strongest among men in enmity to the Believers will you find the 
<br>
<p>Jews and Pagans&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them. And seize them, 
<br>
<p>beleaguer them and lie in wait for them.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;Those that make war against God and His apostle and spread disorder 
<br>
<p>in the land shall be slain or crucified or have their hands and feet cut 
<br>
<p>off on alternate sides, or be banished from the land&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal rigorously 
<br>
<p>with them. Hell shall be their home: an evil fate.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;Believers, take neither the Jews nor the Christians for your friends.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;When the sacred months are over slay the idolaters wherever you 
<br>
<p>find them. Arrest them, besiege them, and lie in ambush everywhere
<br>
<p>for them.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;When you meet the unbelievers in the battlefield strike off their 
<br>
<p>heads and, when you have laid them low, bind your captives firmly. 
<br>
<p>Then grant them their freedom or take a ransom from them&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
