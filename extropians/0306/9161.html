<em>&gt;&gt;Certainly, I can understand why a 13-year-old would think that (most

<em>&gt; Also remember that this boy is still in the formative stages gathering
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioning what he has learned or started producing new ideas to replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old ideas yet.  That comes with experience.
</em><br>
<p>As I recall, I started tossing out religious ideas as &quot;obviously wrong&quot; at 
<br>
around the age of five, when they first claimed that praying in a language 
<br>
I didn't know (Hebrew) could possibly accomplish anything.  But I didn't 
<br>
actually work up all the way to tossing out the idea of God until age 13 
<br>
or so, and I kept my mouth shut about it until I had moved out of my 
<br>
parents' home.  I would never have voluntarily made a statement about God 
<br>
to nonfamily, though, and certainly not to the press.
