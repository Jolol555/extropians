Rafal said:
<br>
&lt;&lt;### This is incorrect - almost all Americans benefit from the globalization
<br>
of the labor market by being able to buy services and products at a lower
<br>
price. Additionally, the foreign employees of American companies benefit
<br>
from American capital and knowledge, which enables them to purchase globally
<br>
produced goods.
<br>
<p>Freedom is good for you.
<br>
<p>Rafal&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If one has a high-paying job one can, indeed benefit from globalization. On 
<br>
the other hand, if hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs go overseas, and 
<br>
those being paid are paid at a tenth the wage-level that the American IT 
<br>
workers were paid at; there is no way that they, as the &quot;new&quot; workers can ever 
<br>
afford goods and services offered by American companies.
<br>
<p>In essence, the &quot;new country&quot; employees are not part of the American economic 
<br>
cycle. Its not, as if, the Parent company which off-shores these jobs, 
<br>
invests in many new jobs in the US. Why should they, if goods and services are so 
<br>
inexpensive overseas?  This also leads to the de-stablization of American 
<br>
society because skilled jobs are no longer to be had, because of the corporation's 
<br>
cost savings. This can't be a good thing and is already and election issue and 
<br>
a &quot;class warfare&quot; issue as well.
