<em>&gt; &gt; I think you're getting yourself confused with the language of

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Bayesian argument, which I took to be the meat of my point.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Given a theory T and our background theory B, we regard our theory T to

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equal.  Do you contest this for some reason?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's a Bayesian answer to a most un-Bayesian question.  We do not want the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability of our theory P(T) to be as high as possible.  Seriously.  We
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't.  There is no &quot;our&quot; theory in rational thinking.  We want P(T) to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whatever P(T) really should be.  We do not want to argue *for* P(T), we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to equably assemble all the evidence for and against T.  This being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case, I as a human find it quite highly suspicious when people try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have their cake and eat it too.
</em><br>
<p>This completely missed the point.  The point is that we want to pick the T
<br>
with the highest probability.  I'm not trying to MAKE P(T|~B) higher so as
<br>
to make P(T) turn out better for my favorite T, I'm suggesting that we
<br>
ought to select T over T', under which P(T|~B) is low; that, furthermore,
<br>
if we can find a T* that's even *more* likely, we should switch to that
<br>
instead.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It moreover follows from Bayes' Theorem that if B is evidence for T,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then ~B *must* be evidence against T - you *cannot* have your cake and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eat it too.
</em><br>
<p>The degree of confirmation that B is for T is given by the log of the
<br>
likelihood ratio
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(lR) log (P(T|B)/P(T|~B)).
<br>
<p>You're right, it can't be both positive and negative.  But what of that?
<br>
I'm precisely proposing a case where T should be (largely) independent
<br>
from B, or at least more independent from B than T'.  (Note that T is
<br>
fully independent from B only when lR is 0; but we can say that T is
<br>
*more* independent from B than T' if the lR of T is closer to 0 than the
<br>
lR of T'.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Let's suppose I agree with you that any theory T for which P(T|B) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; P(T|~B) are both high is less &quot;constrained by the territory&quot; than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; alternate theory T', under which P(T'|B) = P(T|B), but P(T'|~B) is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; low.  T' is constrained by the territory.  T is less constrained by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; territory.  Are you trying to tell me, against Bayes, that we should hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; T' to be more likely than T, because T is &quot;mere philosophy&quot; whereas T' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;constrained by the facts&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nope!  Reality has no preference one way or the other.  Therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neither should our theories.  If T and T' start out being mostly equal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then in the situation you name, we should slightly prefer T to T'.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's my whole point!  You smear T as &quot;mere philosophy&quot;, but my
<br>
whole point is that we should slightly *prefer* it for its modularity, not
<br>
reject it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; *However* this is because the prior probability of T' starts out lower,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and then, if we observe B, this will be evidence about T' which raises
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it to the around the level already occupied by T; however we haven't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observed B yet.
</em><br>
<p>Sure.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You cannot say that both B and ~B are arguments for T - that is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not.  I'm saying that T is more independent of B than T', and
<br>
therefore, all else being equal, preferable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   The most you can say is that T is about evenly compatible with B and ~B
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such that B does not interact much with T and is not evidence about T one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way or the other.  Interpreting P(T|B) and P(T|~B) as &quot;high&quot; does not mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that both B and ~B are strong arguments for T; this is *impossible*.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can only mean that the prior probability of T is high and that B is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much additional evidence one way or the other.
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  That's good ol' modularity for you.  You have a problem with that?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But that's not at all the case in my T &amp; T' example, by construction, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it doesn't apply to our &quot;Why believe the truth&quot; argument either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Nobody's saying that we shouldn't consider the probability of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Singularity [P(T|B)] in our calculations.  But we ARE saying that a theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that applies well to Singularitarians and non-Singularitarians alike is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; better theory, more likely to be true, than a theory that applies equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; well to Singularitarians but not at all to non-Singularitarians, ceteris
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; paribus.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The key word is that &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;.  It never is.  Ceteris paribus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what you are saying is true, but ceteris is only paribus if you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happened to stumble across two theories T and T' and you're wondering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vaguely which of them is more accurate.  This business of trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberately assemble evidence *for* a theory is never Bayesian.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are just trying to sum up all the support and anti-support you run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across.  If it happens to support the theory, great, but you can never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *try* to make a theory stronger by *trying* to show it is compatible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with ~B if that is not a natural way for the theory to work.
</em><br>
<p>So, here's where I think you've got me confused.  You see me as saying:
<br>
&quot;Hmm.  I wanna believe claim X.  It's certainly probable given S.  How
<br>
could I make it more probable given ~S?&quot;
<br>
<p>But I'm not saying/doing this at all.  I'm saying: &quot;You've got an argument
<br>
A that entails X.  A is certainly sound given S, but it depends on S;  if
<br>
~S, A is probably not sound.  We should keep an eye out for some argument
<br>
A' (which might also entail X) that's independent of S.&quot;  And, indeed, I
<br>
take myself to have offered a few such arguments, arguments which are
<br>
independent of Singularitarianism.
<br>
<p>These independent arguments are better arguments for X; how much better
<br>
simply depends on how likely a near-future Singularity may be.
