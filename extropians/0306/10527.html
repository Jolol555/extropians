</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
We've seen arguments that _explain_ why it might be important to pursue or
<br>
belief the truth in some contexts and not others. (E.g., it is good to know
<br>
the truth about whether there is a saber tooth tiger outside the cave; but
<br>
it may increase your chances of having more off-spring if you believe
<br>
falsely that your partner is an above average mate). This tells us why we do
<br>
and do not pursue the truth, but it doesn't answer the question of whether
<br>
we _ought_ to. I take it from the betting market idea that the idea is that
<br>
we ought to pursue greater truth. But why should we suppose that it is
<br>
better to throw off &quot;the shackles&quot; of self-deception rather than truth
<br>
seeking? Perhaps with better technology our self-deception could be more
<br>
complete. With better control of our minds we might be able to believe even
<br>
more outlandish things that we find satisfying to believe. (E.g., not only
<br>
am I a better than average lover, I am the world's greatest lover, etc.).
<br>
Perhaps we might employ AI &quot;truth minders&quot; to steer us clear of trouble when
<br>
necessary (as any good minder does). Perhaps we might have a truth toggle
<br>
switch: every day you go into truth mode for a few moments to get done those
<br>
things in your life that require knowing the truth (say managing your
<br>
money). Perhaps in truth mode you realize that your wife is not particularly
<br>
attractive but once you flick the toggle switch you go back to believing she
<br>
is the most beautiful thing in the universe. (Somewhat reminiscent of the
<br>
movie Shallow Hal). So, I take it then that technology will allow us to
<br>
recreate ourselves as better truth seekers or self-deceivers, and, I take it
<br>
that most of us would take the former option if we could. Of course this
<br>
raises the question of whether given our present partially self-deceiving
<br>
natures we might have deceived ourselves about the value of truth seeking. I
<br>
suppose if there is a fact of the matter whether the greater truth seeking
<br>
life or the greater self-deception life is better then the best (and perhaps
<br>
the only way) would be to run the experiment (i.e., live for a while each
<br>
conception of the good life).
