<em>&gt; Er, Eliezer, this *is* exactly an example of Doomsday type reasoning.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you are a billiard who does not know his number, you reason that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; since only one in a hundred million balls are in the small barrel, there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is only a one in a hundred million chance that you are in the small

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50/50 chance you are in the small barrel.  Your estimate of &quot;doom&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (living in a small barrel) just went way way up.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, it's an example of applying the Self-Indication Assumption 
<br>
followed by the Doomsday Argument, which I think might turn out to be a 
<br>
case of making two sequential mistakes that cancel out.  I agree that if 
<br>
you look at a complete set of indistinguishable cognitive pointer states 
<br>
corresponding to each billiard in all barrels, then a well-calibrated 
<br>
estimate for these pointer states is 'one in a hundred million'.  If a 
<br>
billiard which *starts out in this state* looks at itself and discovers 
<br>
the number '5', then the Doomsday Argument would apply as evidence and the 
<br>
probabilities would change.
<br>
<p>But you can also be born seeing the number '5', and you'd find your 
<br>
probability was 50/50 when you started.  You can only get a 'Doomsday 
<br>
Argument' by imagining that you cancel out a fact that you already know, 
<br>
and cancel it in a certain specific way, which - given that your *final* 
<br>
answer must equal 50/50 to be correct - leads you to think that your 
<br>
&quot;prior&quot; before &quot;learning&quot; this piece of &quot;evidence&quot; must have been very 
<br>
high, i.e., the SIA prior.  Personally I look on all of this with 
<br>
suspicion.  There are millions of times more grains of sand than humans. 
<br>
Should I conclude that I started out with an enormous prior probability of 
<br>
being a grain of sand?  There is nothing a cognitive pointer state *could 
<br>
have been*; it just *is*.  A mind is just something that the physical 
<br>
universe coughs up from time to time, and all you can do is try and 
<br>
calculate the correlation of that pointer state with environmental 
<br>
variables.  You can go forward from the discovery of new evidence; I'm not 
<br>
sure it makes sense to selectively eliminate evidence you were born with 
<br>
and ask what your &quot;priors&quot; were before that.  I didn't start out with a 
<br>
one-in-six-billion chance of being Eliezer Yudkowsky.  I'm just Eliezer 
<br>
Yudkowsky, where an Eliezer Yudkowsky is something the universe coughs up 
<br>
from time to time.  My prior probability of being Eliezer is 1.
