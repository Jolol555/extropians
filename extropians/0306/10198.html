</em><br>
<p>There are a million people just like you, Olga, who believe there are
<br>
&quot;reliable techniques&quot; for trading the market. I was once one of them. To be
<br>
very frank about it, and I don't mean to be rude, but I'm quite sure that
<br>
I've forgotten more about stock trading than you ever knew. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately in every case when such techniques have been subjected to
<br>
rigorous statistical analysis, they have failed the test. This does mean
<br>
that some people have not made money with such techniques. You may be one of
<br>
those who has. It means only that people have no more chance of
<br>
outperforming the market in the future with the techniques than those who
<br>
don't use the techniques. 
<br>
<p>I know it's difficult to understand and believe... trust me I spent a big
<br>
chunk of my life as an investment professional who believed and promulgated
<br>
the same religion that you hold dear. I stubbornly banged my head for nearly
<br>
12 years against the truth before it finally sunk in. 
<br>
<p>Fortunately the market does go up over time with the growth of the world
<br>
economy, so any trading strategy that keeps you long more than short, and in
<br>
more than out, is going to make money over time. However this fact also
<br>
helps to perpetuate the myth that market skill exists. If you don't
<br>
understand statistics, and if you don't understand such concepts as
<br>
opportunity cost, then you will tend to see your profits as evidence of
<br>
trading skill.
