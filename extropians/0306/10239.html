<br>
since before the age of sixteen.  I have seen nothing within the recent debacle 
<br>
on the Extropian mailing list that leads me to reconsider this.  &quot;Patriotism 
<br>
switches on, brain switches off&quot; appears to be the rule.  I shall side with the 
<br>
right whether it be this country or another.  Patriotism cannot help, can only 
<br>
hinder, in computing this.  If America is right then America is right whether 
<br>
I had been born American or French.  If America is wrong then America is 
<br>
wrong whether I had been born British or Iraqi.
<br>
<p>Elienzer,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the mass media of today with zillions of bits of data coming at 
<br>
you how do you determine what is true and what is untrue.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given the sheer number of claims coming at us any man might be 
<br>
forgiven if he thought the Arabs of 911 were merely retaliating against prior 
<br>
American misconduct.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am saying that to a large extent ones decision might be colored by 
<br>
ones viewpoint -- not our prior prejudices but simply where we happened to be 
<br>
standing and our ability to get information from that viewpoint.  For example 
<br>
Amara is in Europe and surrounded by people that have different interests than 
<br>
we have in this country.  I am sure she is fair mainded enough to that she 
<br>
tries to discount part of what she is hearing.  But how does she get total 
<br>
information, fair information and information free of self interest?  I don't envy 
<br>
the lady.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now of course you can say that I am just as vulerable (although to a 
<br>
different set of biases) as Amara is.  I will agree.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also true that we can discern different layers of society all 
<br>
with its set of prejudices, all with their slice of available information.  I 
<br>
was on campus and one teacher harranged the class with his PC version of events 
<br>
and from that viewpoint a reasonable continuation of events.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end the determining factor for me was my acquaintence with 4 
<br>
middle eastern people, my reading of their newspapers on line, and listening to 
<br>
a middle eastern group that convinced me that all the claim they were 
<br>
motivated by the sins of the Americans was a simple smokescreen.  I got a slightly 
<br>
mixed message.  My middle eastern friends obviously loved the countries of their 
<br>
birth.  But, in the end their media convinced me that public opinion in the 
<br>
middle east is being driven by the rulers of those countries based on fear of 
<br>
what will happen if and when their populations call them to a reckoning -- a 
<br>
reckoning of the social and economic conditions the population finds surrounding 
<br>
them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the end I had to conclude that those attackers had attacked us and 
<br>
would continue attacking us regardless of any merit or lack of merit in the 
<br>
American position or conduct.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in this group we debate many subjects.  Sometimes the language 
<br>
gets very harsh.  I've certainly had my feelings hurt, I am sure others have 
<br>
also.  Never the less we all agree that physical attack is beyond the pale.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about Patriotism, if you will forgive me the use of capital 
<br>
letters.  Even Eisenhower soldier and fighter that he was knew that Patriotism 
<br>
is a farce, a studied air put on by folks attempting to fool us.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still on 911 we saw firemen, policemen, emergency medical people and 
<br>
sometimes others running toward the burning towers.  I don't think Patriotism 
<br>
had any part in that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Instead we had men and women that loved their fellow man, that loved 
<br>
their city enough to put their own bodies in harms way to protect and serve 
<br>
those same people.  For lack of a better word we call that love, that willingness 
<br>
to walk in harms way to serve, patriotism.  But the real stuff never needs 
<br>
capitalization.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you be so sure that same love is not in the hearts of the 
<br>
soldiers, etc., that went into Afghanistan and Iraq?  Just today we found another Al 
<br>
Queda base in western Iraq.  That is not the first one.  On March 3rd George 
<br>
Bush laid out his reasons for removing Sadaam.  Events have proven him right 
<br>
despite the caterwauling.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In one sense the caterwauling over Iraq is misplaced in that the war 
<br>
has moved on to other countries around the world.  Sometimes the war is 
<br>
military and sometimes it is diplomatic.  But it is intense in anycase.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still I return to your concern being with patriotism.  You  decided 
<br>
against any patriotism at 16 yo or earlier.  Don't you love anyone enough to 
<br>
place your body between them and danger?  Does 911 ask for anything more than an 
<br>
extension of that love?  Isn't it better to face danger now with friends than 
<br>
wait until you are forced to defend your loved ones by yourself?
<br>
