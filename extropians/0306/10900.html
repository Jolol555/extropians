Brett Paatsch:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; ... &quot;we've been able to do selective memory wiping for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; at least a year now...&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;...I was joking about wiping away any feelings of guilt that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;might arise if one could and did wipe away particular memories 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at will...  Brett Paatsch
</em><br>
<p>Surgical removal of guilt feelings would be a wildly
<br>
popular application of such a technology, were it
<br>
to become available.  Of course one would suffer
<br>
condemnation from *every* major religion, this
<br>
being their jealously guarded line of business,
<br>
in which they would not welcome additional competition.
<br>
<p>A better use of this tech would be in dentistry.
<br>
Do let me offer this scenario:
<br>
<p>A coworker comes to the office raaaaving about a
<br>
wonderful new dentistry office in town, Needleman
<br>
and Paatsch.  One goes into the office, wait for ones
<br>
name to be called, then as if by magic one immediately
<br>
find oneself again in the sitting room, teeth all
<br>
fixed, three hours past and no problem at all.
<br>
<p>Coworkers try this and all agree, it is the very most
<br>
perfectly painless oral procedure ever.
<br>
<p>So you go in, but being an inquiring mind, you ask
<br>
the practitioners what is this wonderful anesthetic
<br>
they have discovered.  They tell you it isn't anesthetic
<br>
at all, but a post op memory wipe.  You will still
<br>
suffer all the pain of an ordinary oral operation
<br>
without anesthetic.  More so in fact, for the
<br>
memory wipe is more effective if the exact
<br>
memories can be identified by increased contrast:
<br>
the doctors actually enhance your pain.
<br>
<p>This of course evokes further questioning from
<br>
you, upon which time you learn that upon walking
<br>
thru the door, a pair of burly galoots strip the
<br>
patient naked and tie him or her to the chair,
<br>
attach electrodes to the testicles or nipples, apply
<br>
excruciating electric shocks while the doctor
<br>
performs the procedure.  The shock levels are
<br>
not high enough to leave any scars, just enough
<br>
to cause the patients to shriek in unspeakable agony.  
<br>
<p>You decline the procedure, returning to the office 
<br>
to tell your coworkers what they have been thru.
<br>
One says he doesn't care, his teeth are fixed,
<br>
he felt no pain, has lost no skill, knowledge nor 
<br>
wisdom, other than his wisdom teeth.  But another
<br>
coworker starts to squirm uncomfortably as she realizes 
<br>
the cruel torture she has apparently suffered.  She 
<br>
eventually goes back to Dr. Needleman and has him erase 
<br>
the memory of your telling her about the doctor's methods.  
<br>
That works.  In fact, she later returns and has Needleman
<br>
erase the memory of her entire second marriage,
<br>
this being easily identified by it's being a 
<br>
biorecord of pain and misery from start to finish.
<br>
<p>Of course it is only a matter of time before word
<br>
gets around and a long waiting list soon forms
<br>
on Needleman's appointment book, as patients want
<br>
all feelings of guilt removed from their brains, this
<br>
being a very special kind of pain: the kind that 
<br>
actually gets worse as time passes.
