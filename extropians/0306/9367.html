<em>&gt;The term &quot;neo-conservative&quot; has been around since the early 1980s
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and has been widely used in political science since then.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It refers to a group of intellectuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who were at one time supporters of the Democrats
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(some had even earlier been on the far left)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who moved towards the Republican party
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and conservatism in the late 1970s/early 1980s
</em><br>
<p>I think there is good evidence for this characterization.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The neocons have their agenda
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;And they have been remarkably successful in seeing it implemented.
<br>
<p>They should be proud [instead of suddenly disowning the &quot;neo-con&quot;
<br>
label]...they did exactly what they said they were going to do.
<br>
<p>Whether you call them &quot;neo-cons&quot; or not, in 1997 a group of Right wing
<br>
Republicans formed The Project for the New American Century (PNAC); their
<br>
aim was to prepare for the day when the Republicans regained control of the
<br>
White House - and, it was hoped, the other two branches of government as
<br>
well - so that their vision of how the U.S. should move in the world would
<br>
be in place and ready to go, straight off-the-shelf into official policy.
<br>
<p>This PNAC group was led by Donald Rumsfeld, Dick Cheney, James Woolsey, Paul
<br>
Wolfowitz, Richard Perle, Bill Kristol, James Bolton, Zalmay M. Khalilzad,
<br>
William Bennett, Dan Quayle, Jeb Bush, most of whom were movers-and-shakers
<br>
in previous Administrations, then in exile, while Clinton was in the White
<br>
House.
<br>
<p>With the selection of George W. Bush in 2000. The &quot;outsiders&quot; from PNAC were
<br>
now powerful &quot;insiders,&quot; placed in important positions from which they could
<br>
exert maximum pressure on U.S. policy: Cheney is Vice President, Rumsfeld is
<br>
Defense Secretary, Wolfowitz is Deputy Defense Secretary, I. Lewis Libby is
<br>
Cheney's Chief of Staff, Elliot Abrams is in charge of Middle East policy at
<br>
the National Security Council, Dov Zakheim is comptroller for the Defense
<br>
Department, John Bolton is Undersecretary of State, Richard Perle is chair
<br>
of the Defense Policy advisory board at the Pentagon, former CIA director
<br>
James Woolsey is on that panel as well, etc. etc. (PNAC's chairman, Bill
<br>
Kristol, is the editor of Rupert Murdoch's The Weekly Standard.)
<br>
<p>One doesn't have to speculate what the PNAC guys might think, since they're
<br>
quite open and proud of their theories and strategies. Indeed, they've left
<br>
a long, public record that lays out quite openly what they're up to.
<br>
<p>A shorthand summary of PNAC strategies that have become U.S. policy[*]:
<br>
<p>1. In 1992, then-Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney had a strategy report
<br>
drafted for the Department of Defense, written by Paul Wolfowitz, then
<br>
Under-Secretary of Defense for Policy. In it, the U.S. government was urged,
<br>
as the world's sole remaining Superpower, to move aggressively and
<br>
militarily around the globe. The report called for pre-emptive attacks and
<br>
ad hoc coalitions, but said that the U.S. should be ready to act alone when
<br>
&quot;collective action cannot be orchestrated.&quot; The central strategy was to
<br>
&quot;establish and protect a new order&quot; that accounts &quot;sufficiently for the
<br>
interests of the advanced industrial nations to discourage them from
<br>
challenging our leadership,&quot; while at the same time maintaining a military
<br>
dominance capable of &quot;deterring potential competitors from even aspiring to
<br>
a larger regional or global role.&quot; Wolfowitz outlined plans for military
<br>
intervention in Iraq as an action necessary to assure &quot;access to vital raw
<br>
material, primarily Persian Gulf oil&quot; and to prevent the proliferation of
<br>
weapons of mass destruction and threats from terrorism.
<br>
Somehow, this report leaked to the press; the negative response was
<br>
immediate. Senator Robert Byrd led the Democratic charge, calling the
<br>
recommended Pentagon strategy &quot;myopic, shallow and disappointing....The
<br>
basic thrust of the document seems to be this: We love being the sole
<br>
remaining superpower in the world and we want so much to remain that way
<br>
that we are willing to put at risk the basic health of our economy and
<br>
well-being of our people to do so.&quot; Clearly, the objective political forces
<br>
hadn't yet coalesced in the U.S. that could support this policy free of
<br>
major resistance, and so President Bush the Elder publicly repudiated the
<br>
paper and sent it back to the drawing boards. (For the essence of the draft
<br>
text, see Barton Gellman's &quot;Keeping the U.S. First; Pentagon Would Preclude
<br>
a Rival Superpower&quot; in the Washington Post.)
<br>
<p>2. Various HardRight intellectuals outside the government were spelling out
<br>
the new PNAC policy in books and influential journals. Zalmay M. Khalilzad
<br>
(formerly associated with big oil companies, currently U.S. Special Envoy to
<br>
Afghanistan &amp; Iraq ) wrote an important volume in 1995, &quot;From Containment to
<br>
Global Leadership: America &amp; the World After the Cold War,&quot; the import of
<br>
which was identifying a way for the U.S. to move aggressively in the world
<br>
and thus to exercise effective control over the planet's natural resources.
<br>
A year later, in 1996, neo-conservative leaders Bill Kristol and Robert
<br>
Kagan, in their Foreign Affairs article &quot;Towards a Neo-Reaganite Foreign
<br>
Policy,&quot; came right out and said the goal for the U.S. had to be nothing
<br>
less than &quot;benevolent global hegemony,&quot; a euphemism for total U.S.
<br>
domination, but &quot;benevolently&quot; exercised, of course.
<br>
<p>3. In 1998, PNAC unsuccessfully lobbied President Clinton to attack Iraq and
<br>
remove Saddam Hussein from power. The January letter from PNAC urged America
<br>
to initiate that war even if the U.S. could not muster full support from the
<br>
Security Council at the United Nations. Sound familiar? (President Clinton
<br>
replied that he was focusing on dealing with al-Qaida terrorist cells.)
<br>
<p>4. In September of 2000, PNAC, sensing a GOP victory in the upcoming
<br>
presidential election, issued its white paper on &quot;Rebuilding America's
<br>
Defenses: Strategy, Forces and Resources for the New Century.&quot; The PNAC
<br>
report was quite frank about why the U.S. would want to move toward
<br>
imperialist militarism, a Pax Americana, because with the Soviet Union out
<br>
of the picture, now is the time most &quot;conducive to American interests and
<br>
ideals...The challenge of this coming century is to preserve and enhance
<br>
this 'American peace'.&quot; And how to preserve and enhance the Pax Americana?
<br>
The answer is to &quot;fight and decisively win multiple, simultaneous
<br>
major-theater wars.&quot;
<br>
<p>In serving as world &quot;constable,&quot; the PNAC report went on, no other
<br>
countervailing forces will be permitted to get in the way. Such actions
<br>
&quot;demand American political leadership rather than that of the United
<br>
Nations,&quot; for example. No country will be permitted to get close to parity
<br>
with the U.S. when it comes to weaponry or influence; therefore, more U.S.
<br>
military bases will be established in the various regions of the globe. (A
<br>
post-Saddam Iraq may well serve as one of those advance military bases.)
<br>
Currently, it is estimated that the U.S. now has nearly 150 military bases
<br>
and deployments in different countries around the world, with the most
<br>
recent major increase being in the Caspian Sea/Afghanistan/Middle East
<br>
areas.
<br>
<p>5. George W. Bush moved into the White House in January of 2001. Shortly
<br>
thereafter, a report by the Administration-friendly Council on Foreign
<br>
Relations was prepared, &quot;Strategic Energy Policy Challenges for the 21st
<br>
Century,&quot;that advocated a more aggressive U.S. posture in the world and
<br>
called for a &quot;reassessment of the role of energy in American foreign
<br>
policy,&quot; with access to oil repeatedly cited as a &quot;security imperative.&quot;
<br>
(It's possible that inside Cheney's energy-policy papers - which he refuses
<br>
to release to Congress or the American people - are references to
<br>
foreign-policy plans for how to gain military control of oilfields abroad.)
<br>
<p>6. Mere hours after the 9/11 terrorist mass-murders, PNACer Secretary of
<br>
Defense Rumsfeld ordered his aides to begin planning for an attack on Iraq,
<br>
even though his intelligence officials told him it was an al-Qaida operation
<br>
and there was no connection between Iraq and the attacks. &quot;Go massive,&quot; the
<br>
aides' notes quote him as saying. &quot;Sweep it all up. Things related and not.&quot;
<br>
Rumsfeld leaned heavily on the FBI and CIA to find any shred of evidence
<br>
linking the Iraq government to 9/11, but they weren't able to. So he set up
<br>
his own fact-finding group in the Pentagon that would provide him with
<br>
whatever shaky connections it could find or surmise.
<br>
<p>7. Feeling confident that all plans were on track for moving aggressively in
<br>
the world, the Bush Administration in September of 2002 published its
<br>
&quot;National Security Strategy of the United States of America.&quot; The official
<br>
policy of the U.S. government, as proudly proclaimed in this major document,
<br>
is virtually identical to the policy proposals in the various white papers
<br>
of the Project for the New American Century and others like it over the past
<br>
decade.
<br>
<p>Chief among them are: 1) the policy of &quot;pre-emptive&quot; war - i.e., whenever
<br>
the U.S. thinks a country may be amassing too much power and/or could
<br>
provide some sort of competition in the &quot;benevolent hegemony&quot; region, it can
<br>
be attacked, without provocation. (A later corollary would rethink the
<br>
country's atomic policy: nuclear weapons would no longer be considered
<br>
defensive, but could be used offensively in support of political/economic
<br>
ends; so-called &quot;mini-nukes&quot; could be employed in these regional wars.) 2)
<br>
international treaties and opinion will be ignored whenever they are not
<br>
seen to serve U.S. imperial goals. 3) The new policies &quot;will require bases
<br>
and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia.&quot;
<br>
<p>In short, the Bush Administration seems to see the U.S., admiringly, as a
<br>
New Rome, an empire with its foreign legions (and threat of &quot;shock&amp;awe&quot;
<br>
attacks, including nuclear weapons) keeping the outlying colonies, and
<br>
potential competitors, in line. Those who aren't fully in accord with these
<br>
goals better get out of the way; &quot;you're either with us or against us.&quot;
<br>
<p>As I say, it was all laid out years ago, but nobody took such extreme talk
<br>
seriously; now that they're in power, actually making the policy they only
<br>
dreamed about a decade or so ago - with all sorts of consequences for
<br>
America and the rest of the world - we need to educate ourselves quickly as
<br>
to how the PNACers work and what their future plans might be.
