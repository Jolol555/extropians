</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to disagree, it's unclear whether they have to notice the ambiguity.
</em><br>
<p>The difficulty here stems from two different senses of the word 
<br>
&quot;disagreement&quot;.  Ideal Bayesians who &quot;disagree about values&quot; still cannot 
<br>
&quot;disagree about facts&quot;.  That is, having different values does not allow 
<br>
ideal Bayesians to disagree about facts, including the fact of who assigns 
<br>
what values.  Perhaps this means that the term &quot;disagreement&quot; should not 
<br>
be used for differing values, and we should simply say that Bayesians may 
<br>
&quot;assign different values&quot;.
<br>
<p>This confusion stems from treating &quot;value&quot; as an abstract variable with 
<br>
deixis; if we apply the term &quot;value&quot; to a specific Bayesian, we fill in 
<br>
that Bayesian's specific values.  Both X and Y agree that X's values say Q 
<br>
and that Y's values say P, but if you abstract out the specific X and Y 
<br>
and talk about the abstract variable &quot;values&quot;, which takes on the specific 
<br>
values of the speaker, then X and Y &quot;disagree&quot; on &quot;values&quot; because they 
<br>
agree that values(X) differs from values(Y).  Think of X and Y as objects, 
<br>
and values as an instance method.  We say that X and Y &quot;disagree&quot; because 
<br>
they give different outputs for the &quot;values()&quot; function call, but they 
<br>
both agree on the output of &quot;X.values()&quot; and &quot;Y.values()&quot;.
<br>
<p>The problem is that the above is about ideal Bayesians who have not 
<br>
evolved to argue about morality, and it does not even begin to fit or 
<br>
explain human intuitions about morality, which are much more complicated. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;In the above scenario no one would ever argue about morality!  It may 
<br>
even be questionable whether the &quot;values&quot; of the ideal Bayesians referred 
<br>
to above are like what humans think of as &quot;values&quot;, any more than 
<br>
activation of a simple numerical reinforcement center is what a human 
<br>
thinks of as &quot;fun&quot;.
<br>
<p>One oversimplified way in which you can have a genuine disagreement about 
<br>
values is if there is a common computation Values() and that X and Y have 
<br>
a disagreement of fact about what output Values() produces, with no deixis 
<br>
or curried functions involved.  But of course that is not how human values 
<br>
work either.  It's a bit complicated.  See my post in this thread on 6/17.
