Bleh, mail client sent off that one before it was done :P
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Uh, just in case you didn't know, Kuwait was originally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part of Iraq, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Like Sudan was part of Egypt.  In point of fact, Iraq refused to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; recognize Kuwait as an independent country until 2 years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *AFTER* the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; gulf war. So as far as I'm concerned, Saddam didn't invade anybody.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amazing, so because Saddam, a murderous tyrant, does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize a group of individuals who of their own free will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose to leave his country and form their own, they are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a legitimate country?  Countries exist only as collections of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individuals, and deserve no existence beyond the collective 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acceptance of its citizens.  If a group of citizens chooses 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to excise themselves from an oppresive dictatorial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government, they DO NOT NEED HIS PERMISSION *or* recognition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to form a legitimate state!!!  What system of ethics do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prescribe to, the 'Dictator has final say over everything' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system?  Do you think the people of Kuwait feel Saddam 'didnt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invide anyone'?
</em><br>
<p>I'm merely pointing out that this particular dilemma (of rebelling
<br>
populace being squashed by its parent country) is repeated throughout
<br>
both history *and* current events.  And that in the past, successfully 
<br>
squashed rebellions are judged valid actions by the parent country in a 
<br>
historical context, but that successful rebellions where a foreign power
<br>
is 
<br>
brought into the conflict to threaten (and beat) the parent country,
<br>
history
<br>
is less enthusiastic about endorsing whether or not the parent country's
<br>
<p>actions were valid.  But given the tendency of states to respond to
<br>
rebellions
<br>
with &quot;suppressive&quot; (sometimes genocidal) force, it seems clear to me
<br>
that it
<br>
is, if nothing else, and accepted strategem @ the nation-state level.
<br>
<p>And yes, that includes the United States, who, if threatened with
<br>
serious succession
<br>
today, would no doubt go to great lengths, *including* the steady
<br>
application of violence,
<br>
to crush said rebels.  And no doubt, if the rebels were smart, they
<br>
would (similar to Kuwait)
<br>
call in a coalition of foreign powers to aid in dealing with the US.
<br>
<p>And while I'm not particularly keen on the notion of nation-states, I
<br>
can understand
<br>
their use of such a strategem, because examination of history proves
<br>
that, while it sucks
<br>
morally, it does indeed work.
<br>
<p>On a personal note, I think the notion of nation-states is out-of-date
<br>
and needs revision.
<br>
I have the glimmer of an idea of what I would like to see, but it
<br>
requires much more
<br>
examination of legal systems, history and some serious critical debate
<br>
for me to flesh 
<br>
it out to a point that I would consider acceptable.
<br>
<p>omard-out 
<br>
PS&gt; the capitals are gone (for now :P)
