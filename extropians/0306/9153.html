In a message dated 6/1/2003 12:18:58 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:fauxever@sprynet.com?Subject=Re:%20Boy%20Genius%20or%20Craft%20Idiot?">fauxever@sprynet.com</a> quotes Ron h: Does your example or your argument gain power when it is 
<br>
couched an offensive manner?  No I didn't misunderstand anything.  You have 
<br>
made yourself very clear.  You feel prerfectly justified in insulting people 
<br>
that you have never had offend you in any way.
<br>
##Then you replied, &quot;What was offensive about what I said?&quot;
<br>
<p>Olga,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The term &quot;religious nut&quot; comes to mind.  You have thrown that around 
<br>
throughout your writing.  Unless I am mistaken you have even used the term in 
<br>
connection with a 13 year old boy having remarked that his intelligence was a 
<br>
gift from God.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wrote earlier, 'On the other hand he says: &quot;[arrogantly] I believe 
<br>
I was given a special gift from God, and [humbly] I don't know why&quot; ... and 
<br>
[as Miss America candidates are inclined to say] &quot;I want to use this gift to 
<br>
help all mankind and bring lasting world peace.&quot; [my italics]  Being that I am 
<br>
constantly naive on this subject, it is astouding to me when people say they 
<br>
were given a special gift from god (female singers are especially likely to say 
<br>
this).  But what I don't understand is how a brain
<br>
(as in the boy genius story) that makes mathematical and scientific 
<br>
connections doesn't make the observation that we just crawled out of the ocean not all 
<br>
that long ago ... and that there is no Monkey King.' 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;##So your concept of God is a &quot;Monkey King?&quot;  You are capable of 
<br>
determining that the boy is being alternately &quot;Arrogant&quot; and &quot;Humble?&quot;  And when 
<br>
you are called on your being insulting you evade and heap further insulting beh
<br>
avior on the pile.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of which sounds to me as if you are a self appointed God with the 
<br>
power to be judge, jury and executioner.  Isn't that the way &quot;religious nuts&quot; 
<br>
behave?
<br>
Ron h.
