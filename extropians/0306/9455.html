I generally respect Friedman but I think he's probably wrong about the
<br>
effects of an American display of power in Iraq.  Throughout history
<br>
ethnic and religious groups who have been beaten or humiliated by
<br>
other groups have harbored grudges.  Those grudges have manifested
<br>
themselves in retributive violence, rather than just rolling over and
<br>
taking it.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Friedman is essentially saying that the US has now shown that it's
<br>
tough, and this will bring the Arab governments into line, which will
<br>
in turn reduce terrorism.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But Friedman is wrong about the role of states in terrorism, both now
<br>
even moreso in the future.  The Taliban probably new nothing about the
<br>
9/11 attack.  The training facilities in Afghanistan were irrelevant
<br>
to it.  All it took was a couple hundred thousand dollars and some
<br>
people willing to die.  Future terrorist attacks will just get chaper
<br>
and easier as the technology of destruction advances.  Increasingly
<br>
governments won't matter in terrorism at all - just motivated
<br>
individuals, like the angry muslim men who crashed those planes on
<br>
9/11.  The US attack on Iraq has probably increased the number of such
<br>
angry muslim men willing to die if they can take some Americans with
<br>
them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
On the other hand, I think what Friedman lists as the &quot;right&quot; reason
<br>
to invade attack may pay major dividends.  If the US can succeed in
<br>
nation building, and help establish a prosperous and democratic Iraq,
<br>
it'll have a major positive effect on the region.  That effect, in the
<br>
long run, could outweigh the short term increase in Arab anger towards
<br>
the US.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
But if the US only shows strength, and fails to build a prosperous
<br>
democracy in Iraq, the invasion of Iraq will be a large net negative,
<br>
especially for the US itself.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From: John K Clark [mailto:<a href="mailto:jonkc@att.net?Subject=RE:%20[Iraq]%20The%20real%20reason%20for%20the%20war">jonkc@att.net</a>] 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thomas Friedman had a interesting column in the New York Times
<br>
today about the true reasons for the Iraq war and I think he was
<br>
absolutely correct:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;===========
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There were actually four reasons for this war: the real
<br>
reason, the right reason, the moral reason and the stated reason.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;real reason&quot; for this war, which was never stated, was
<br>
that after 9/11 America needed to hit someone in the Arab-Muslim
<br>
world. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &quot;right reason&quot; for this war was the need to partner with
<br>
Iraqis, post-Saddam, to build a progressive Arab regime. Because the
<br>
real weapons of mass destruction that threaten us were never Saddam's
<br>
missiles. The real weapons that threaten us are the growing number of
<br>
angry, humiliated young Arabs and Muslims, who are produced by failed
<br>
or failing Arab states — young people who hate America more than they
<br>
love life. Helping to build a decent Iraq as a model for others — and
<br>
solving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict — are the necessary steps for
<br>
defusing the ideas of mass destruction, which are what really threaten
<br>
us.
<br>
