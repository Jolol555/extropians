<p>Matus asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Does anyone else on the list feel that the current communist vietnamese
<br>
government is a legitamate one?  Note I will not be attacking those who
<br>
express this opinion, I am just curious how prevealent this opinion is on
<br>
this list.  Samantha, do YOU feel the current communist government of
<br>
Vietnam is a legitimate one?  Does anyone on this list (besides Jeff) feel
<br>
as much?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;They are &quot;legitimate&quot; in the sense of the fact that ARVN did not want to
<br>
fight. Now, are they the kind of government, I would wish on a dog, hell no!
<br>
But just like Iran and Iraq, there was something in the people that
<br>
tolerated these types of governments, promoted them, allowed them to take
<br>
their sons in the military and security forces, and that their sons
<br>
voluntarily oppress the rest. Easy for me to say, yet the lack of
<br>
counter-revolution is evident. I am assuming that the current anti-Mullah
<br>
fever will soon be swept away in Iran.&quot;
<br>
<p>More South Vietnamese soldiers died fighting north Vietnam then French
<br>
soldiers died fighting Hitler, it is a popular myth the people of the south
<br>
did not fight the communist north invaders.  I think the clearest indicator
<br>
of that myth is the fact that 1 million people took off in boats into the
<br>
south china sea instead of face the communist 'paradise' that awaited them.
<br>
If they were motivated enough to leave their entire lives behind to face
<br>
near certain death at sea instead of face communist enslavement and forced
<br>
peasantry, its seems reasonable that they were also motivated enough to
<br>
fight before the soviet backed communist victory.
<br>
<p>In either case, do I take your answer to be 'No, the Vietnamese govt is NOT
<br>
legit'
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Secondly, Jeff makes various assertions about my debating abilities,
<br>
including claiming that many of my 'facts' are inventions of my idealogy, I
<br>
am dishonest and insulting, incoherent, I am not qualified to discuss
<br>
political topics, undisciplined, lack effort..&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>&quot;Look, when people whine about debating methods, its just so much empty
<br>
writing that is better ignored, rather then addressed. Them's that dishes it
<br>
out, must also taketh - Book of Yog Sothoth, Chapter 6, verse 211    Now let
<br>
us all prey!&quot;
<br>
<p>I agree with you for the most part, however Jeff's comments seemed to be
<br>
very sincere on his part, which Is why I would value the opinion of other
<br>
extropes on this question.  Since we rarely partake in debate (if ever) do I
<br>
take your answer to be that you disagree in general with Jeff's description
<br>
of my extropian mailing list qualities?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
