<em>&gt; As I mentioned my statistical project these days is horse racing. I read
</em><br>
an
<br>
<em>&gt; interesting research report in a statistics journal about an apparent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inefficiency in paramutual betting at the track: it seems that the most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boring and conservative bets, (show bets on heavy favorites), have bigger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pay-offs than they should have in an efficient market for bets. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistics suggest that novices tend to bet on long shots for the sheer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrill and entertainment value, creating an opportunity for professionals
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; make a profit on the favorites.
</em><br>
<p>As i have not gone in the horsie direction yet, i guess it's safe to point
<br>
You to two sites that are quite handy when it comes to horses..
<br>
www.betbrain.com and www.oddsexchange.com  both sites display multiple odds
<br>
on the race allmost real time.
<br>
<p>Horse races are of the kind where the players set the odds. If enough
<br>
players don't know what they're doing, or if there are many combinations,
<br>
some of which are not played enough by chance - then You should get out
<br>
ahead if You can get enough information to see the betting landscape, if you
<br>
know the odds of the horses winning to a reasonable degree, and if you're
<br>
playing the right way at the right time. Unfortunately just a few pro
<br>
players will remove the imbalances - and if the players that play at the
<br>
last minute doesn't do as they usually do, you're toast anyway.
<br>
<p>The long-shot bias is quite well defined and researched ( check
<br>
www.bjmath.com ) i have had some fun trying to calculate my way around it,
<br>
and earning some money while doing so. It is not always easy (or possible)
<br>
to get from idetifying an anomality to a system that makes you a steady
<br>
income. However, it seems i tend to get faster and faster at programming
<br>
what needs to be programmed and my systems perform more and more
<br>
predictably. Right now it is kind of a hobby for me to try to identify games
<br>
or investment areas where imbalances might be, and build systems that
<br>
exploit them. It would probably be infinitely more easy just to set up an
<br>
online casino and earn money that way  - but it wouldn't be as intersting...
<br>
<p>It takes a broad range of skills (or a little luck) to make it in the
<br>
gambling business - until now i'm just doing it for fun. My hourly wage is
<br>
way below what i could get as a contractor doing systems development. Just
<br>
to warn wanna-bee's i have been playing with numbers and games the last 21
<br>
years. I reinvented the basic probabillity math 3 years before i encountered
<br>
some of it in scool. I just started to break even with this kind of
<br>
ventures.. However, a skilled math guy with good logical sense and lots of
<br>
&quot;feel&quot; for probabillities might be able to build sufficient skills in a year
<br>
or two.
