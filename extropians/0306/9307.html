<p>Speicher, Saddam &amp; Wmd: Together? 
<br>
<p>By John Leboutiller on 06/02/03 
<br>
<p>It's now two months since the war in Iraq ended and yet we have made almost no
<br>
progress on three crucial unresolved issues: 
<br>
<p>1) Where are Saddam and his two murderous sons? 
<br>
<p>2) Where is 1991 Gulf War Navy Commander Michael Scott Speicher - long reported
<br>
by credible intelligence sources to be alive and under the 'personal' control of
<br>
Uday Hussein? 
<br>
<p>3) Where are the Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) that precipitated that war in
<br>
the first place? 
<br>
<p>Is it possible that all of them - Saddam and sons, Speicher and barrels/vials of
<br>
the most potent WMD - are together somewhere? 
<br>
<p>Could the treacherous Saddam have grabbed Speicher from his last underground
<br>
prison cell and taken him with him during his own 'escape from Baghdad'? 
<br>
<p>In other words, poor Speicher is Saddam &amp; Sons' insurance policy against any
<br>
direct attacks on their location or attempts to seize them. 
<br>
<p>Here is a so-far unreported clue: for thirty years Saddam has 'adopted' young
<br>
male orphans throughout Iraq and raised them to become loyal sycophants. All of
<br>
his personal bodyguards were thus raised and recruited. They were always
<br>
fanatically loyal to Saddam - and only to Saddam. He rewarded them with
<br>
Mercedes, with legal immunity for many crimes and with tons of cash. 
<br>
<p>These 'bodyguards' were more powerful than most of the 55 Iraqi leaders on the
<br>
deck of cards because they controlled access to their Great Leader. 
<br>
<p>In the two months since the war ended, we have not heard of one of these
<br>
bodyguards being captured. Not one. 
<br>
<p>Where are they? Certainly if they are roaming around Baghdad some citizens would
<br>
finger them to US troops for capture. 
<br>
<p>Is it possible they aren't around because they have escaped with their 'father'
<br>
- Saddam - his two sons, Speicher as insurance, tons of ill-gotten cash and gold
<br>
and the most potent WMD - all for protection and insurance? 
<br>
<p>Another tantalizing clue: US forces are not finding any evidence of bodies
<br>
buried at either site bombed when we thought we caught Saddam by surprise - once
<br>
on the first night of the war and the other in early April. In fact, the US Army
<br>
Colonel in charge of 'digging up' remains at the site of the first bombing said
<br>
most bombs missed their targets.And there never was the long-rumored
<br>
'underground command bunker' we had been told of. 
<br>
<p>In fact, where are all these underground palaces we had heard of? Have you seen
<br>
even one on television? Have our media been denied access - or do they simply
<br>
not exist? 
<br>
<p>Two months; no news on Saddam &amp; Sons, Speicher and WMD. 
<br>
<p>Maybe they're all dead and buried. 
<br>
<p>Or maybe - just maybe - they're all together in hiding some place. 
<br>
<p>In that case, why can't our highly vaunted, $60 billion per year intelligence
<br>
operation find them?
