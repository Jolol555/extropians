<em>&gt; Of course that raises the question of why believing in the truth should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have such an overwhelming importance, moral or otherwise.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausibly argue that it is more moral to be loyal to one's group, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if this means that your beliefs will be biased, just as they believe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is more moral to give charity to members of your group, even if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means that worse off outsiders go without. I have to admit to while I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that there are few things more important than believing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth, I can offer only disappointingly weak moral arguments to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this.
</em><br>
<p>Here are some of my favorite answers:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;Because I value the truth as a thing in itself.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;If the sky is blue, it's blue.  If I think that's true, how could 
<br>
I believe something else just because I wanted to?  That's not how my mind 
<br>
is wired.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;Because knowing the truth is the best and only means of achieving 
<br>
the goals I care about.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;Because even the process whereby I *decide* my goals depends on 
<br>
finding the actual answers (as opposed to the comforting or convenient 
<br>
answers) to logical or factual questions.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;Because if I wrapped myself up in a private world, severing my 
<br>
connection to outside reality, I would destroy my potential to grow as a 
<br>
person.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;Darn, I don't have enough knowledge to answer that question.  I'd 
<br>
better go get some.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* &quot;Because without accurate knowledge, I'd have no way of knowing how 
<br>
dangerous it was to be ignorant.&quot;
<br>
