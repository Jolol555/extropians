<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Pure emotion?  Isn't this the second time today I've caught
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you in gross exaggeration?  What is happening to you, Eliezer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Can't you try for a little detachment here?  You're making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; it so black and white.
</em><br>
<p>I wish to public ally apologize for using the words &quot;What is
<br>
happening to you?&quot;, and my purported evidence that Eliezer
<br>
was establishing a track record of exaggeration.  These 
<br>
comments were unnecessarily provocative and superfluous
<br>
to what I really wanted to say.  (That Eliezer is usually
<br>
unruffled by such provides no excuse.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Quite often I become equally searingly annoyed with both 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sides of a particularly stupid fight.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Why shouldn't we confuse you with a human? If you were consistent about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoiding group polarization, wouldn't you stick to terms that describe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the degree to which people fail to be Bayesians, rather than using a word
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such as &quot;pure&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Why are the fights stupid? Are the people engaged in them being hurt by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their participation in them?
</em><br>
<p>I agree that often the fights are not as &quot;stupid&quot; as many
<br>
(who are disgusted) would think.  But yes, it does turn
<br>
out that people are harmed, even by attacks on their ideas.
<br>
The harm sometimes even compares to an actual physical wound
<br>
in the time it takes to recover, and the unhappiness it creates.
<br>
<p>But while people wiser than I am no doubt have long lists of
<br>
tricks to avoid such pain (I do have a couple myself), there
<br>
is no easy way of getting around it in our struggle for truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My guess is that they are on average being successful at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advertising themselves to members of their groups as being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; altruistic, loyal, or something like that,
</em><br>
<p>Quite right.  That is what is going on.  But in addition
<br>
there is also
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* joining the good fight against bad memes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* venting one's feelings
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* standing up for the underdog
<br>
<p>and more, I suspect.  The first on my list of three here is
<br>
what inspires crusaders to fight for the oppressed, and gives
<br>
them energy that the Bayesians lack.  I have respect for the
<br>
crusaders (occasionally I am one), both the ones for and against
<br>
the ideas I support.  They have played and will play a crucial
<br>
role in history and in society.
<br>
<p>I have no use for the act of merely venting one's feelings on
<br>
a forum such as this.
<br>
<p>Finally, my emotions do sometimes pull me in the direction of
<br>
standing up for the underdog, but I try to sacrifice that urge
<br>
for the sake of getting to and speaking the truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [The fighters] aren't being significantly hurt by the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that they are annoying the more Bayesian list members.
</em><br>
<p>Heh, heh.  I agree: not at all!  They're imploring the more
<br>
restrained to join them, and figure that people who don't agree
<br>
with them need to be challenged even if it does amount to annoyance.
<br>
That these challenges often don't meet the standards that the
<br>
&quot;Bayesians&quot; would prefer is rarely, you are right, of concern
<br>
to them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think &quot;pandering to a rather unsophisticated tribe&quot; might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a better way of describing what's wrong with the fight.
</em><br>
<p>Yes---and you and I will have a fairly large overlap in the
<br>
parties or tribes we deem unsophisticated.  And I *probably*
<br>
am less affected by their arguments on the whole.  Yet, again,
<br>
it's the truth that counts, of course, and wisdom can
<br>
sometimes come from surprising quarters.
<br>
<p>Lee
