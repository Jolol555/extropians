<p>One of the most interesting thing about the Doomsday Argument is that most
<br>
people have a strong negative reaction, yet the arguments they offer against
<br>
it are usually much weaker than they realize.  Harvey's is no exception.
<br>
<p>I find the argument well worth considering, but in the end unpersuasive.  I
<br>
agree with the published formal critics that the DA neglects what Nick calls
<br>
the &quot;Self-Indication Axiom&quot;.  That is, the DA suggests that you consider the
<br>
various possible worlds that there could be, including worlds with varying
<br>
numbers of people in them, and suggests that you pick some sort of symmetric
<br>
or simple prior over those worlds, but that all the while you assume that
<br>
you would have existed no matter what.  If you instead allow for the 
<br>
possibility
<br>
that you might have never existed, and pick your symmetric or simple prior
<br>
over all worlds, including worlds where you don't exist, there is no DA.
<br>
<p>Now Nick (Bostrom) criticizes this approach because it suggests that all else
<br>
equal you should think worlds with more people (or creatures that you could
<br>
have been) are more likely, and this could greatly favor some cosmological
<br>
theories over others.  I think Nick too easily conflates possible worlds with
<br>
cosmologies; small cosmologies can be in possible worlds with many people
<br>
simply by having the world have many of those cosmologies in it.
