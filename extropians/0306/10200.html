</em><br>
<p>While far from identical, they would share a number of facets. As in, if 
<br>
I was designing a database to track down these people, I might include 
<br>
insurrectionist tactics from many different cultures and times. I would 
<br>
never compare the U.S.'s original revolutionaries and founders to 
<br>
sadistic Baathist murderers, just that both groups might make use of the 
<br>
same stratagems and such have attributes in common.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Those like Saddam Hussein
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be hunted down after they lose wars!
</em><br>
<p>Yeah it's a lot easier than hunting them down after they win wars.
<br>
<p>Considering all the bombing the US has done, it's no wonder muslims hate 
<br>
us and become terrorists. So why not just rename 'civilians' to 
<br>
'potential terrorists'? That way we can say that US troops killed x 
<br>
thousand Iraqi troops and x thousand potential terrorists. No civilians 
<br>
were killed at all! Like that poster kid w/o the arms: he could've used 
<br>
those later in life to throw a grenade at US troops! (he might have 
<br>
reasons, like the US killing his family.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Exactly the same thing was done to the Nazi organization
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after WWII, and ought always to be done. Because if it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not done, a ruthless minority of fanatics will once again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume power, and the atrocities will go on and on and on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's how history works, unfortunately.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but analogous to overuse of antibiotics, the overuse of force has 
<br>
only created super-resistant terrorists. (Cf. the 'TV Funhouse' cartoon 
<br>
(on Sat Night Live) where Hussein and UBL can shapeshift into innocuous 
<br>
typical desert objects when US troops approach). And isn't it ironic how 
<br>
we've accomplished two of UBL's goals: leave saudi arabia and bring down 
<br>
the secular Hussein regime.
<br>
<p>I recall some opinion piece in WaPo where the writer suggested that 
<br>
Microsoft, Sun, and Oracle launch a 'Digital Marshall Plan'. He 
<br>
suggested Sun supply the servers while MS supply desktops. Oh yeah I can 
<br>
see that happening. In any case a digitized Iraq, full of educated young 
<br>
men resentful at the occupation but too intelligent to face overwhelming 
<br>
US firepower, could probably turn out some hellacious encryption and 
<br>
anti-echelon software. Gee, wonder if there would be a market for that?
