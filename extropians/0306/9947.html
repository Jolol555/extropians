</em><br>
<p>I have a problem with the statement on from 2 different viewpoints:
<br>
1) Consumer:  Having reduced their labor costs by 1/10th, 
<br>
are US software companies going to pass that savings on to me?
<br>
Has anyone here seen the tangible benefits to the off-shoring of IT?
<br>
<p>2)Producer:  Is the government willing to either 
<br>
a) deflate the dollar hard-core to equalize the currencies globally so
<br>
American's
<br>
can compete globally on a 1-1 hour basis with foreign workers and
<br>
perhaps equalize
<br>
the trade imbalances that currently exist?
<br>
Or
<br>
b)  subsidize the IT industry like it has others so that US programmers
<br>
are
<br>
Paid (salary-wise) the equivalent of Indian programmers, and receive
<br>
cost-of-living
<br>
Adjustment adjusted subsidies tied to the competing foreign currencies
<br>
exchange rate?
<br>
<p>If they're unwilling to do either, or something as effective, than I
<br>
have no sympathy 
<br>
for your logic.  Its already difficult enough (read: costly) to live
<br>
decently in the U.S. on 
<br>
a single (much less dual!) income family.  To be forced to compete for
<br>
skilled labor
<br>
on foreign currencies rates while still paying US-style prices is
<br>
flat-out suicidal.
<br>
<p>Personally I'ld rather see the dollar deflate terribly than endure MORE
<br>
of my tax dollars
<br>
going to patch a currently (and inevitably) downward spiraling dollar.
<br>
They could start
<br>
By allowing other currencies to be used for the purchase/sale of oil,
<br>
and of course, by
<br>
eliminating all the hard-currencies flowing out of the country for drug
<br>
sales.  Not that
<br>
Any US politician would have the balls to do such a thing.
<br>
<p>omard-out
