Alfio Puglisi: Argh. We live in interesting times...
<br>
<p>This is a contradiction, Alfio.  The term Argh
<br>
usually carries a negative connotation, whereas
<br>
one can scarcely imagine wanting to live out one's 
<br>
only chance at life in boring times.  I thank 
<br>
evolution I live in interesting times.  Your comment
<br>
is analogous to saying &quot;Dammit.  I just won the
<br>
lottery.&quot;
