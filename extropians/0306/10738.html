One thing I don't get about the spending on tech weapons.
<br>
<p>Seems the US has such an overwhelming military advantage
<br>
that no single country in their right mind would take them on
<br>
in a conventional or even nuclear war. 
<br>
<p>Add to that the fact that the US is linked in through a number
<br>
of alliances. And I wonder what the need is for the type of big
<br>
toy &quot;defence spending&quot;. I heard Australian PM Howard talking
<br>
about possibly being a buyer of nuclear defence shielding 
<br>
systems. This seems completely nuts to me. The chances of 
<br>
being attacked by ICBMs etc seem virtually zero in comparison
<br>
with say a suitcase nuke or dirty bomb or something similar. 
<br>
ICBMs leave a trail that's like a return to sender with interest
<br>
message. 
<br>
<p>I used to reckon the stuff about the military/industrial complex 
<br>
running on an economic imperative that had nothing to do with
<br>
much else besides preserving the status quo in spending was a
<br>
bit batty even in the cold war. But now, who is the US really
<br>
preparing to fight or defend itself against?
<br>
<p>The types of weapons being built seem to be the wrong ones
<br>
for fighting terrorists and small scale guerrilla wars. And these
<br>
seem to be exactly the sorts of conflict that are likely to arise.
