<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; For those who aren't spiritual, this isn't a big leap. You are the

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; It really is not that simple.  Further, there is a problem with
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; (the English) language, such that when one refers to a an object,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it's not clear whether you mean that object or all objects of that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; class.  If I talk about a book I own, it's unclear whether I mean
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; that I own all the information in all books like it (as many say
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the author does), or only the physical instance of the book.  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; confusion is at the heart of most arguments about both &quot;intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; property&quot; and uploading/copying of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But if you are the same person that you were last month,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you are the same person after you wake up from a coma
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wherein your EEG was zero for an extended period, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what are you besides information?  What else could you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly be?
</em><br>
<p>Let me clarify:  The part I disagree with is the point I inferred
<br>
from &quot;regardless of how it is stored&quot; in the original post.  I'm
<br>
not interested in storage; I'm interested in processing.  Runtime,
<br>
as it were.  I am not just the information required to run me, I
<br>
am the instance that is running right now.  I *was* the person I
<br>
was last month, but I am now one month removed from being that
<br>
person.
<br>
<p>People are processes, not data.
<br>
<p>In my current opinion, of course.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, most debates about this get bogged down in differences
<br>
between definitions of &quot;same&quot; and similar words and phrases, without
<br>
the debaters seeming to be aware of that.  I was just trying to head
<br>
off another iteration of &quot;extropians talking past each other&quot;.  :)
