<p>
Extropes,
<br>
<p>For many, this brings to mind the &quot;luddite rejection&quot;
<br>
issue.  However, I have stumbled across a separate
<br>
GM-crop issue, a legal problem--gene patent law legal
<br>
problem--which might reasonable be seen by any
<br>
county's leadership as grounds for signing on to the
<br>
treaty in question so as to preserve the freedom of
<br>
action which is the treaty's central feature. 
<br>
Consequently, folks wanting to promote the value
<br>
offered by GM crops will need to consider the problem
<br>
and how it might be corrected.
<br>
<p>Perhaps you've heard of this.  In 1997, a Canadian
<br>
farmer, with long years of growing canola, found
<br>
Round-Up (tm) resistant canola growing in one of his
<br>
fields, the result of the wind borne spread of pollen
<br>
from the nearby fields of other growers.  He was an
<br>
alert and knowledgeable farmer and knew it was
<br>
genetically modified and how it got into his seed
<br>
stock, and subsequently into his crop--he would sell
<br>
his crop, but hold back seed for planting next year's
<br>
crop.  He selectively saved the seed from the Round-Up
<br>
resistant plants and planted them, mixed with others,
<br>
for his 1998 crop.    
<br>
<p>Monsanto, the patent holders on the gene conferring
<br>
Round-Up resistance, sued the farmer for patent
<br>
infringement, and won, and won on appeal, and now the
<br>
farmer is counter-suing.
<br>
<p>Here's a couple of links to the story:  
<br>
<p>The whole shebang
<br>
<a href="http://www.percyschmeiser.com/">http://www.percyschmeiser.com/</a>
<br>
<p>and the appeals court decision
<br>
<a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fct/2002/2002fca309.html">http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fct/2002/2002fca309.html</a>
<br>
<p>I've spent the last hour or so reading parts of the
<br>
Appeals Court Decision and thinking it over, but
<br>
haven't gotten to the counter suit.  I've been
<br>
guessing thought about what approach the counter suit
<br>
might take.
<br>
<p>It isn't over till it's over, but at this juncture, it
<br>
looks like the patent holder can broadcast his
<br>
pollen/gene, and then bill the owner of any plant so
<br>
pollinated--unwilling or no--for any possession or use
<br>
of any plant tissue containing the gene.
<br>
<p>So here's a case where the uncontrolled release of the
<br>
gene, a predictable consequence of commercial-scale
<br>
canola agriculture, poses a threat those farmers
<br>
previously uninvolved, unaffected, and independent.
<br>
<p>To put in the words of the article below:
<br>
&quot;  ...genetic mutations could ...cause havoc...&quot;
<br>
<p>At least havoc in the 'commercial environment'.
<br>
<p>Grounds for the treaty, or no?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Life doesn't have to survive -- 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;its the *code* that counts.&quot;

<em>&gt; &quot;The United States and the European Union have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dispute over genetically modified products, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreement has stalled the current round of WTO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talks.

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 16/06/2003 A United Nations treaty regulating the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of genetically modified products will soon go into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after gaining the approval of a 50th U.N. member.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Pacific nation Palau ratified the controversial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treaty,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; known as the Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Friday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fifty nations needed to adopt the pact before it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into law, 90 days from now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The U.N. Environment Program said Saturday that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Palau`s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move will help make use of genetically-modified
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products
</em><br>
<em>&gt; safer by allowing countries to reject them without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proof
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they pose any danger.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the agreement goes against current World Trade
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Organization (WTO) rules that require countries to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific proof of a risk to refuse entry of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; products.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Associated Press reports none of the major grain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; producing countries has ratified the protocol,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the United States.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The United States and the European Union have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a dispute over genetically modified products, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreement has stalled the current round of WTO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trade talks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Genetically modified foods have had their genes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; changed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually to make them more resistant to disease or to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce in greater quantities. Proponents say they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no risk and could work to alleviate poverty. Critics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the genetic mutations could pose health hazards and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause havoc in the environment.
