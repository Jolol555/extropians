<p>
My final comment on this particular thread is that them that dishes it out 
<br>
can't take it. From what I surmise, is that there seems to be a few on this list 
<br>
who when contradicted, respond by complaining about personal attacks. Why 
<br>
raise political subjects then, or respond to them, if one sees their views as 
<br>
sacrosanct? Or at least don't whine when someone opposes your views and call it 
<br>
personal.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, since many global topics are by their nature, polemical. 
<br>
Interactions with radical militant, are indeed personal. As personal as an 
<br>
enhanced fission weapon detonating in DC or LA. This is a real-world worry, and 
<br>
not some fantasy.  Like I said, some topics are polemical by nature. Sometimes 
<br>
one is forced to choose. Often, there is no choice. 
<br>
<p>This list, cannot go back to being what it was in the 1990's; because the 
<br>
past is gone and the world has changed, and will change more. One may garner, a 
<br>
greater civility, at the cost of a lessened relevancy. But there is room in the 
<br>
world, for such a list or group such as this. Please be aware it will not be 
<br>
in the vanguard. Remember the word relevancy, because it will come back to 
<br>
haunt. I gar-on-tee.
