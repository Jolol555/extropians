<em>&gt; &gt; What I find so amusing is that we have Olga here, trashing a 13

<em>&gt; &gt; old, for thinking there is a God while being allegedly so high an

<em>&gt; Mike, did I not write (to Rafal)?:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***&quot;... we can cut him some slack.  The kid is only 13 and is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dependent on his grownups (or, sounds like, they may be dependent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on him?).&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***I also agreed (I don't remember with whom) that the kid is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitely worth watching.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***I also agreed with Newstrom:  [Olga Bourlin wrote]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, I can understand why a 13-year-old would think that (most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; teenagers are prone to narcissism, anyway - it's probably even an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important developmental step).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ***Mike, why are you ignoring the whole of what I've written?  Please
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond to this point.
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm not. What I am doing is drawing a contrast between what seems
<br>
to be a need for you to attack religiosity when overtly expressed as
<br>
such (even to the point of dissing a 13 year old kid, which I think was
<br>
excessive, and which you seem to be backing off a bit, good for you!),
<br>
yet you have been silent on the writing of Nick Bostrom, whose
<br>
simulation arguments MANDATE that there be a system operator, i.e. a
<br>
'God' to have created this universe if it is indeed a simulation. I'll
<br>
note that you failed to respond to this point in my post. Please do
<br>
respond now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I've not had any trouble shedding religiosity at a very early 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; age (and I'm no genius),  I was wondering what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people thought.  I've learned some things here (I usually do), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciate the input from all the posters.
</em><br>
<p>I'll note that you failed to respond to my earlier post making just
<br>
that contrast, that Mr Smith IS a supergenius and you are not, so IMHO
<br>
it's a bit arrogant for you to think that it was to be assumed that you
<br>
automatically knew more than him, in calling him arrogant for thinking
<br>
that there is a God.
<br>
<p>As for myself, I'm enough of a genius to say I don't know the answer. I
<br>
am genius enough to say that the arguments made by Nick Bostrom are
<br>
persuasive that we likely do live in a simulation. If that is so, then
<br>
the argument that there is a creator 'God' is implicit. Furthermore,
<br>
the range of knowledge between what we know and what such a theoretical
<br>
God must know to have achieved this simulation is so significant that
<br>
we really are in no position to judge any limits on what is and is not
<br>
possible for such a God to do within this simulation.
<br>
<p>Thus, if the simulation argument holds, then atheism is dead, and
<br>
religiosity is an acceptable standard for scientific individuals to practice.
