Ron H observed:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;They are using the US as Hitler used the Jews.  Consequently their stories 
<br>
are nothing but a long list of events spun to make the US appear villainous.
<br>
       All in all there is obviously a large segment of the middle eastern 
<br>
people that regard us only as fit for subjugation.  To them we are a people 
<br>
without a God or any standards whatever.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I have to chime in ( Do you have to? Yes!) because I think people on this 
<br>
list, no matter how angry at the American government (and a majority of the 
<br>
people) they are; need to recognize the threat of radical, militant, Islam. Hitler, 
<br>
and the National Socialists were &quot;intelligent&quot; enough to pick on weaker 
<br>
peoples like Gypsies (Romany) Jews, Poland, etc. 
<br>
<p>When they underestimated the Anglo powers they screwed up, and when they 
<br>
underestimated the Russians, they screwed up even worse. Radical militant Islam is 
<br>
antagonistic to everything virtually everyone on this list supports, save, 
<br>
anti-Americanism. The Radical Militant sects of Islam have scape-goated the 
<br>
wrong people, is my point.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; All in all there is obviously a large segment of the middle eastern people 
<br>

<br>

<br>
<p>Yes, its a different mentality indeed. I think of KKK terrorist, Robert Eric 
<br>
Rudolph, freshly captured last weekend, as a kind of &quot;daguerreotype&quot; of this 
<br>
state of mind that is present in so many graduates of Islamist schools, 
<br>
sponsored by Wahabbi and Iranian Ayatollahs. And, guess what troops, the radical 
<br>
Islamist movement is as serious at proselytizing as your fire-breathing 
<br>
Evangelical is, or, even worse, your average Amway salesperson.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;In the meantime, Michael, you are right.  &quot;Norway, still being a country 
<br>
that is not Islam, is eventually to be targeted.&quot;  Michael, the shame and the 
<br>
futility of it is those poor dummies don't realize that we smart enough to 
<br>
listen to them and draw the obvious conclusions.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Ron h.  &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, indeed! Today the World! Tomorrow Norway!
