<p>Sorry, I wasn't completely clear.  The electric and gravitational fields
<br>
move along with the star only while it is moving uniformly.  If the star
<br>
gets bumped, the *change* in the field propagates outward at c.  At time
<br>
t after the bump there is an expanding sphere of size c*t, where inside
<br>
the sphere the field has changed due to the bump, but outside the sphere,
<br>
nothing has changed yet.  Outside of the sphere, the field points to
<br>
where the star would have been at that moment if it hadn't been bumped.
<br>
This part of the field doesn't know yet about the bump.
<br>
<p>This can perhaps be most easily understood if you think of the simplest
<br>
case, where the speed of the star is zero.  Then it is not surprising
<br>
that the field is spherically symmetric around the center, right?
<br>
Now bump the star, and the field will change; but the change will
<br>
propagate outward at speed c.  Outside of the sphere of size c*t, the
<br>
field is undisturbed and still points placidly at where the star was
<br>
before the bump.
<br>
<p>Think about how this would look from the perspective of a moving observer
<br>
(which is the same as looking at a moving body+field from a stationary
<br>
observer) and it will hopefully be easier to see how it works.
