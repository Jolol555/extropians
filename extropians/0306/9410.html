<p><em>&gt; I am faced with the unfortunate and perhaps hypocritical

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this is
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;<a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/eldred/petition.html">http://www.petitiononline.com/eldred/petition.html</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now my ethical conundrum is that the first sentence of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; petition says something along the lines of &quot;while we believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the value of copyright, we also believe in the value of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strong public domain...&quot; Well, I personally don't believe in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the value of copyright at all. I see this bill as a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiny step in the right direction, so I support its goals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I cannot in good conscience sign a statement I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agree with. 
</em><br>
<p>You are a wonder Lee. ;-)  I'd sign your petition but I'm not a
<br>
US citizen. Despite holding the view that it *is* possible in 
<br>
principle to write laws that *do* mean something, the &quot;bush 
<br>
lawyer&quot; (don't know if that term is a cultural one and will cross
<br>
the Pacific) in me reckons there must be a way for an imaginative
<br>
and motivated guy like yourself to resolve your dilemma with
<br>
ethics in-tact. There is wriggle room (ambiguity) in most forms
<br>
of human language. 
<br>
<p>The statement causing the concern is:
<br>
<p>&quot;We, the undersigned, while believing in the importance of 
<br>
copyright, also believe in the importance of the public domain.&quot;
<br>
<p>Consider the following.
<br>
<p>1) Do you believe copyright law *exists* whether you agree 
<br>
with it or not.
<br>
<p>2) Do you believe its existence is important? ie. Seems to me
<br>
you thinks its important enough to think we'd be better of 
<br>
without it. But that *still* means its important to you.
<br>
<p>Besides, the statement &quot;we&quot; is a collective one. By your
<br>
own statement you suspect *most* do agree that copyright
<br>
is important. There is only one petition &quot;we&quot; are signing and
<br>
therefore the statement &quot;we, the undersigned&quot; (by
<br>
overwhelming majority *acting in concert* on the majority
<br>
view) do believe etc.
<br>
<p>For some reason I'm reminded of Bertrand Russell talking
<br>
of Spinoza. &quot;Ethically Spinoza was supreme.&quot; But Spinoza
<br>
suffered a lot.
<br>
<p>I reckon you can sign with a clear conscience Lee, but it's
<br>
*your* conscience. ;-)
