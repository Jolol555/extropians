<br>
<em>&gt; There is also the concern over personal reputations and having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misrepresentations tar us in public.  Many of us have professional careers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that require us to avoid the appearance of impropriety.  I personally have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had clients reject contracts with me because an Internet search on my name
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows me connected to the Extropians List.  Most people don't realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is why I drop in and out over the years, and why I suddenly disappeared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the Board of Directors.  When the list just becomes too extreme, I feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it is detrimental for me to be associated with it.  I have never had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any problem with ExI or the philosophy.  But the false accusations on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list and the level of debate here literally reflects poorly on my and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; damages my profession.  A simple Google on any of our names will bring up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the list archives due to our numerous postings.  This instantly links each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of us to list discussions whether we are personally involved or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>This is why I operate on a variety of pseudonyms on the Net.  I prefer to 
<br>
express my opinions as they are without having to worry about what you 
<br>
mention above.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I will even reveal something that few people know.  A couple of years ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when I was involved in a dot-com startup that no longer exists, one of our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; venture capitalists expressed interest in providing funding to ExI.  They
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought our futuristic and technological philosophies might give an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executive better insight and a better reputation.  They were intrigued by my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involvement with the Board of Directors and thought this would make my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; executive profile look attractive to investors in future startups.  To
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facilitate this angle, they thought they could have their execs as members
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for free think-tank support and prestige, as well as indicating their active
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involvement in promoting future technology.  In return, they would want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide funding to keep ExI viable and promotional activities to enhance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ExI's visibility in the technology sector.  The idea was still at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talking stage, and I had barely mentioned the possibility to Max and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Natasha, when suddenly they pulled out and dropped any consideration of me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or ExI for any future projects.  They had found the list and were reading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  They said their execs were horrified at what they saw.  They were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unanimous that they did not want to be even indirectly associated with such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unprofessional behavior.  This was a huge loss of a potential support and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding for ExI.  And it was lost due to bad behavior on this list which had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing to do with ExI, the Board of Directors, or anything officially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connected to the extropian philosophy.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>This is what I said years ago: the extropian list is a public surrogate for 
<br>
the extropian institute and the people who run it. So therefore politically 
<br>
correct opinions are an embarassment.  Well, I have a suggestion, then. Just 
<br>
sort through the list archives and find the posts that you find politically 
<br>
correct (or correct in whatever fashion you find appropriate). Then store 
<br>
them and write a bot to periodically post them to this list.  With a little 
<br>
more work, you can even have them quoting each other :-)
<br>
&nbsp;Investors will not read the list enough to notice the facade.
<br>
<p>Then, create another list for those who post profilfically here. Hide that 
<br>
list so that potential investors cannot find it. Of course, it is hard to get 
<br>
new list subscribers that way. But then again, when is the last time a new 
<br>
subscriber made made than a couple of posts here, anyway?
