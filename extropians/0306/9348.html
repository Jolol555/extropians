<em>&gt; One has to whack the web site designers &amp; developers in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side of the head and say -- &quot;Hey, do you know that Javascript
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not only crashes browsers because it is not a &quot;standard&quot; language,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slows page download times (due to the increased size of pages that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; involve Javascript), allows annoying pop-up windows that will not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; go away, and increases consumption of CPU time that I would rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dedicate to more productive distributed computing purposes?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>There are reasons that people use Javascript, though...
<br>
<p>1 - You can make a website look a lot better, and behave better (for ie5.5+
<br>
users at least) using lots of javascript. This may not jibe with yourself,
<br>
but most of the users out there want something aesthetic and user friendly;
<br>
straight html is often not so.
<br>
<p>2 - Many web sites these days are web apps. When we wander into app
<br>
territory, the site tends to be judged against tradional windows software.
<br>
Users want instand validation of data entry, they want windows-like dynamic
<br>
control behavior, they want complex controls like trees and pretty lists.
<br>
These things are not catered for by html; they require client side
<br>
processing (ie: Javascript).
<br>
<p>3 - Browser based apps are big in enterprise computing, slowly replacing the
<br>
traditional client-server app. Inside an intranet, you can control the
<br>
browser used and the browser settings, and you can trust intranet sites in a
<br>
way that you can't trust internet sites. You also tend to have a nice
<br>
responsive LAN. So, the desire for glossy, MS only feature exploitation very
<br>
much outweighs concerns of security, portability, universal standards, and
<br>
efficiency. Why does this affect the outside world? Because a lot of (most?)
<br>
web style development is taking place in such an environment. People learn
<br>
habits here which bleed out into internet development, because the same
<br>
people get jobs in both environments.
<br>
<p>4 - MS only sites/apps/javascript turns up a lot due to commercial
<br>
imperative. IE just has such a large marketshare (especially amongst the
<br>
mainstream) that the extra effort required to make code behave properly (ie:
<br>
also work with netscape and opera) is in no way worth the expense (which can
<br>
be huge). I think it is becoming increasingly common to see web development
<br>
environments where there isn't even a netscape machine to test the final
<br>
product on, let alone any thought about it in development.
<br>
<p>5 - Any client side processing that you can do makes sense, if it doesn't
<br>
overcomplicate things (= more difficult dev = higher maintenance costs),
<br>
because you take load off your servers. People have big fat PCs, doing
<br>
bugger all (if not navel gazing, they are looking for ET or something
<br>
equally non-contributory to business-Xs bottom line). Servers cost lotsa
<br>
moola.
<br>
<p>There are probably a bunch more reasons to be using Javascript. What I would
<br>
say is...
<br>
1 - Client side processing has it's place. Some of the reasons above are
<br>
nasty, evil realities that should be abolished but wont be. Others are
<br>
entirely legitimate. Some are in between somewhere.
<br>
2 - You shouldn't lament the use of client side processing. You should
<br>
lament the lack of standards for it (which cause the problems), and the
<br>
ramifications of a virtual MS monopoly wrt browsers.
<br>
3 - Get a newer version of netscape, pleeeeeease. Version 4.0 blows goats.
