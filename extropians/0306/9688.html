E. Yudkowsky just said:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Flandern is a well-known relativity crank.

Research Fellow, Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence&gt;&gt;
A few weeks ago, Flandern was attacked and defended his record (on the usenet 
physics group) between himself and another physicist. The crank thing by Baez 
concerns me because along with using it to dismiss kooks, it serves to 
dismiss anyone out of step with majoritarian views. It does good, but it also does 
harm. It seems to be what Sagan was bothered by, concerning attacks in 
Velikowsky (who in my opinion really was a kook!) and a desire for conformity.  
Similarly, Mr. Yudkowsky's goal for an SI-AI singularity would face scorn from many 
if not most more conservative researchers; who seem to be the majority of 
them.  They would insist on a doctorate in computer science, and a list of 
published, peer-reviewed papers published by accredited, recognized journals. Fair or 
not, that's how people seem to be, academics included.
