<br>
<p><em> &gt; When the 911 attacks came, I thought &quot;***NOW SURELY***
</em><br>
<em> &gt; people will ask 'Why?'
</em><br>
<p>You're assuming that if somebody hates you then you must have done something
<br>
wrong, but hate can be generated far easier than that.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;  Some segment of Islam--maybe even a very large
</em><br>
<em> &gt; fraction--may disapprove of western cultural values
</em><br>
<p>Yes indeed!
<br>
<p><em>            &gt; but so long as we keep it here, and don't force it on
</em><br>
<em>            &gt; them, it's probably not something they care a whole
</em><br>
<em>            &gt; lot about.
</em><br>
<p>In the above you seem to be saying that the Islamic community is infused
<br>
with a basic libertarian attitude, and I'm saying baloney.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It's the aggressive intrusion of the west that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inspires their antipathy.  The crusades.
</em><br>
<p>800 years ago, get over it!
<br>
<p><em>            &gt;The invasions of western &quot;colonial&quot; powers
</em><br>
<p>For a very brief time in their history, and the USA was never part of it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; most noitable  and recently the parcelling up of the mideast by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Europeans (primarily the Brits) after the defeat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Ottomans . [etc]
</em><br>
<p>The long list of bad events you mention happened centuries ago, and measured
<br>
against the historic scale of human evil none of them rank very high,
<br>
certainly not enough to account for their vast rage. Nothing on you list
<br>
comes close to what the Jews experienced, and far more recently too. The
<br>
stuff that happened to Islam is just the sort of hum drum evil that happens
<br>
in history, nothing special.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And finally, the jewel in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crown, the poison pill, the knife in the back (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps I should say the ice pick in the face) of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deliberate, overt, unashamed, and unrelenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;erasure&quot; of Palestine and ethnic cleansing of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Palestinians, accompanied by their replacement by an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ultra-aggressive, ultra-militaristic(which is to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threatening), and ultra-contemptuous  Jewish state
</em><br>
<p>I've said several times that it's a mistake to treat Israel like the 51's
<br>
state, but to say that the reason Muslims in Indonesia hate the USA more
<br>
than they love life is because America supports a nation who harmed a people
<br>
who speak a different language, live 10,000 miles away and who they've never
<br>
seen is ridiculous. Most Indonesian Muslims wouldn't recognize a Palestinian
<br>
if he tripped over him.
