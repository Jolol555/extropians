&lt;&lt;Sergeant First Class John Meadows summed up the prevailing attitude 
<br>
amongst his colleagues telling the Evening Standard that Iraqi fighters 
<br>
were dressed in civilian clothes.
<br>
<p>&quot;You can't distinguish between who's trying to kill you and who's not,&quot; 
<br>
he said.
<br>
<p>&quot;Like, the only way to get through s*** like that was to concentrate on 
<br>
getting through it by killing as many people as you can, people you know 
<br>
are trying to kill you. Killing them first and getting home.&quot;
<br>
<p>And in an admission that directly contrasts with the line coming out 
<br>
from the Pentagon's spin doctors Specialist Corporal Michael Richardson 
<br>
added: &quot;There was no dilemma when it came to shooting people who were 
<br>
not in uniform, I just pulled the trigger.
<br>
<p>&quot;It was up close and personal the whole time, there wasn't a big 
<br>
distance. If they were there, they were enemy, whether in uniform or 
<br>
not. Some were, some weren't.&quot;
<br>
<p>Describing the scene during combat Richardson admitted shooting injured 
<br>
soldiers and leaving them to die.
<br>
<p>He said: &quot;S***, I didn't help any of them. I wouldn't help the f******. 
<br>
There were some you let die. And there were some you double- tapped.&quot;
<br>
<p>Making a shooting sign with his hand he went on: &quot;Once you'd reached the 
<br>
objective, and once you'd shot them and you're moving through, anything 
<br>
there, you shoot again. You didn't want any prisoners of war. You hate 
<br>
them so bad while you're fighting, and you're so terrified, you can't 
<br>
really convey the feeling, but you don't want them to live.&quot;
<br>
<p>And despite there being no link between Iraq and the September 11 
<br>
attacks Richardson admitted that it gave him his motivation to fight Iraqis.
<br>
<p>&quot;There's a picture of the World Trade Centre hanging up by my bed and I 
<br>
keep one in my flak jacket. Every time I feel sorry for these people I 
<br>
look at that. I think, 'They hit us at home and, now, it's our turn.' I 
<br>
don't want to say payback but, you know, it's pretty much payback.&quot;&gt;&gt;
