<p>
By the way, where is the usual whining that we have all
<br>
been through this many times before, and there is no
<br>
point to the discussions, and that it is a waste of time
<br>
etc., etc.?  (Perhaps those who think this are now judging
<br>
that such protestations have now themselves been stated
<br>
many times before, and there is no point to re-iterating
<br>
them, and that it is a waste of time, etc., etc.?  ;-)
<br>
<p>But I have found a wonderful solution to this whole dilemma.
<br>
It is possible---if you are subscribed to the list in such
<br>
a fashion that the posts appear individually---to simply
<br>
not read those posts and ignore those threads that you
<br>
find unproductive.
<br>
<p>This magic elixir also has amazing and unexpected side-benefits!
<br>
I find that I do *not* reply to posts that I have not read!
<br>
<p>So not only is there a great savings in time and energy
<br>
avoiding reading and thinking about topics of no interest
<br>
to me---or that I am tired of---but I save vastly more
<br>
time and energy because for some mysterious reason I don't
<br>
even formulate replies to them!
<br>
<p>Now of course, those receiving the daily digest cannot take
<br>
advantage of this wonderful phenomenon.  The posts appear as
<br>
one continuous scroll, and naturally it would be impossible
<br>
for them to just suddenly stop reading and employ the page-down
<br>
key.  After all, words about the very subjects that they didn't
<br>
want to be informed further about would still catch their eye,
<br>
and it would take superhuman determination not to read all 
<br>
those words.  Advertizers have taken aggressive and opportunistic
<br>
advantage of this awful human limitation by inserting ads in
<br>
magazines, and people are tragically trapped into reading every
<br>
word, whether they want to or not.
<br>
<p>But relatively few of us subscribe in digest mode, and so the
<br>
previous solution I have stumbled upon should really be given
<br>
a try by almost everyone!
<br>
<p>Lee
