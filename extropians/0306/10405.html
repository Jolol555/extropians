On Tue, 17 Jun 2003, Ramez Naam, in reply to my citing U.S. deaths wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This looks like a breakdown of US causes of death to me.   When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; look at the numbers for the whole world, it's like so (as of 2001).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Total Deaths in 2001	56.5 million	100%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Non-communicable[1]	33.1 million	58.6%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communicable[2]		18.4 million	41.4%
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [1] - This category is dominated by heart disease and cancer, both of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which are radically more common in old age.  Even if we imagine that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20% of deaths in this category are not age-related, we end up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; almost half of all deaths being indirectly due to aging.
</em><br>
<p>But we know that there are people who can live past 90 without
<br>
dying of heart disease or cancer -- so one has to assign a
<br>
significant part of the responsibility to self-inflicted
<br>
causes (smoking, poor diet, etc.) and probably an even larger
<br>
fraction to genetic defects.  There are just too many people
<br>
who don't get heart disease or cancer to place the blame on
<br>
&quot;aging&quot; per se.  &quot;Aging&quot; may be a contributing factor but
<br>
I suspect poor genetic combinations are a big part of the
<br>
problem as well.  Does one call mutations in the FAP or
<br>
HNPCC genes that predispose one to colon cancer or the
<br>
several mutations that predispose one to Alzheimer's disease
<br>
&quot;aging&quot;?  I would argue no.  Yes those people age -- but
<br>
the &quot;cause of death&quot; should be assigned to having a losing
<br>
ticket in the genetic lottery.
<br>
<p>If one assumes that the genetic lottery is a significant
<br>
factor in determing whether one dies at 70-80 vs. 100-110.
<br>
then it is a major player in &quot;premature&quot; death.  Interactions
<br>
between environment &amp; diet &amp; the genetic lottery are probably
<br>
another specific fraction -- there are people who smoke or
<br>
drink who do not die a &quot;premature&quot; death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; [2] { snip} Even so, we end up with more than 15 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diseases due directly to infectious diseases, around 26-27% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total deaths in 2001.
</em><br>
<p>Granted.  Fortunately almost all, if not all, of the significant
<br>
disease causing organisms have had their genomes sequenced.  So
<br>
we can rip them apart, as one would open up a shrimp or lobster
<br>
shell, to find their vulnerabilities.  The problem will be in
<br>
delivering solutions to less developed countries affordably.
<br>
<p>Great data BTW.
