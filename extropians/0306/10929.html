<br>
<p>IBM has found a way to get thousands of molecules to assemble themselves 
<br>
into designer crystals, a technique that, along with others, could 
<br>
change how people look at chemistry.
<br>
<p>Collaborating with researchers from Columbia University and the 
<br>
University of New Orleans, IBM was able to create an environment where 
<br>
lead selenide, a semiconductor with optical properties, and iron oxide, 
<br>
a magnetic material, combined to form large crystals exhibiting 
<br>
electrical, optical and magnetic properties.
<br>
<p>The method for combining these materials, however, is just as important 
<br>
as the result in this experiment. These so-called meta-materials, which 
<br>
consist of tens of thousands of atoms, don't occur naturally. The basic 
<br>
crystal unit in this experiment, for instance, consists of 63,000 atoms. 
<br>
They also exhibit behavior not found in the separate materials.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is something where two plus two equals five,&quot; Murray said. &quot;Our 
<br>
building blocks are much larger than those in classical chemistry.&quot;
<br>
<p>Meta-materials hold the potential for substantially changing the field 
<br>
of chemistry because they allow researchers to find new materials 
<br>
exhibiting as-yet-unknown characteristics out of more basic molecules 
<br>
that have been studied for years and, to a large degree, are fairly well 
<br>
understood.
<br>
<p>Also see Nature magazine:

<br>
<p><p>Well! Is this a breakthrough or what?
<br>
This seems to be saying that you can combine anything to make completely 
<br>
new molecules unknown in nature with any properties you want.
<br>
Sounds like a good trick if it works.
