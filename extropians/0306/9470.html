Note, the Institute prefers to be called Caltech versus Cal Tech or
<br>
CAL TECH.
<br>
<p>This was discussed on slashdot a couple of months ago,
<br>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/22/2148241">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/03/22/2148241</a>.  I think the part
<br>
about &quot;6,000 times the capacity of the ordinary broadband links&quot; was
<br>
along the lines of &quot;6,000 times finer than a human hair&quot; or &quot;6,000 times
<br>
heavier than a battleship&quot;, or &quot;6,000 times farther than the distance from
<br>
New York to Los Angeles.&quot;  In other words, a comparison to something that
<br>
users might be familiar with.  In this case, I think they were trying to
<br>
compare the bandwidth of this link versus an ordinary broadband connection
<br>
that a typical user might have used.  Their grammar kind of got away
<br>
from them and the sentence didn't quite work, but that's my guess.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The protocol is called FAST, standing for Fast Active queue management
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Scalable Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). The researchers have
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;achieved a speed of 8,609 megabits per second (Mbps) by using 10
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;simultaneous flows of data over routed paths, the largest aggregate
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;throughput ever accomplished in such a configuration. More importantly,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the FAST protocol sustained this speed using standard packet size,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;stably over an extended period on shared networks in the presence of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;background traffic, making it adaptable for deployment on the world's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;high-speed production networks.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The experiment was performed last November during the Supercomputing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Conference in Baltimore, by a team from Caltech and the Stanford Linear
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Accelerator Center (SLAC), working in partnership with the European
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN), and the organizations DataTAG,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;StarLight, TeraGrid, Cisco, and Level(3).
<br>
<p>It sounds like they actually sent data from California to Geneva
<br>
across the plain old Internet, at 8.6 Gbits per second.  And this was
<br>
contending with all the MP3s and Britney Spears photos and everything
<br>
else.  So that's pretty good.  Of course, probably the toughest part is
<br>
getting an 8.6 Gbit connection to the Internet at both ends!
