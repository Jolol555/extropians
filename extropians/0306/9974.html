<p>I wanted to remark about the &quot;do as I say, not as I do&quot; posture of someone 
<br>
who is a fairly new poster, who writes a bunch of (typically, regarding 
<br>
this topic; not singling you out here as anything special) passionate 
<br>
(inflammatory? *shrug*) stuff, and then caps it off with &quot;now play nice&quot;. I 
<br>
did so.
<br>
<p>There's enough sarcasm on this list to sink any reasonable discussion, as 
<br>
we see.
<br>
<p>I don't see you raising the bar. Perhaps I should use a microscope.
<br>
<p>Thus my attempt at a tiny bit of what the Commonwealth types sometimes call 
<br>
&quot;taking the piss&quot;.
<br>
<p>Nothing more, and nothing particularly uplifting; I herewith retire, 
<br>
leaving you in posession of the field.
