</em><br>
<em>&gt; would lead you to expect?
</em><br>
<p>Sorry if I wasn't as clear as I could have been.  Yes, that's exactly what
<br>
I'm saying - that there are investors who do better than chance would have
<br>
them do.  The rest of my post went:  &quot;There are *techniques successful
<br>
traders and investors use - it takes time and education and work* - but
<br>
there are plenty of people who are doing all right (and many are doing much
<br>
more than just all right).&quot;
<br>
<p>Because this thread didn't exclude professional traders, I was thinking more
<br>
about people who do this for a living.  There are many tools available to
<br>
professional investors (and they're the *same* tools that are available to
<br>
any investor who wanted to learn more about the stock market and how it
<br>
operates - Level II, Island, real time quotes on Streamer, stochastics,
<br>
candlestick charts, and the many other sites devoted to helping investors).
<br>
I do this for a living myself, and am still honing my skills and learning
<br>
new things (but even more experienced traders are constantly learning new
<br>
things).
<br>
<p>As a huge *side benefit,* I keep up with all kinds of interesting news, and
<br>
the news recently has been inspiring (and profitable) indeed, especially in
<br>
the biotech and nanotech sectors.  Check out the recent -
<br>
one-to-three-months' - percentage gains on:  GERN, GENR, DNDN, TGEN, BIOM,
<br>
ALTI, TINY, NGEN, PPHM, VECO, to name a few  (most have dropped off a little
<br>
since making their big moves due to  momentum generated by promising
<br>
research news, but are still hanging in there, and are interesting stocks to
<br>
watch).
<br>
<p>FYI I have never bought a lottery ticket in my life.  I have almost an
<br>
aversion (and never entertain myself) with games of any kind - card games,
<br>
gambling, you name it.  Yech.
