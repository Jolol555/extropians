<em>&gt;I'm skeptical of the efficient market theory.  It treats all decision

<em>&gt;the same response to that information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;None of those three assumptions is correct.  Humans are emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt;decision makers.  There are indeed differences in the information
</em><br>
<em>&gt;investors have access to.  And given the same information, different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;investors would make different decisions based upon their individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analysis, risk tolerance, and of course that emotional factor listed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;above.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't think differing information can explain inefficient prices, for
<br>
reasons that were explained in the recent threads about it being irrational
<br>
for people to disagree. And random emotions wouldn't do much either. I
<br>
think you need to understand the reasons behind the emotions to explain
<br>
persistent patterns of inefficient prices.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;People want to hold popular beliefs. It's easier to feel comfortable
<br>
holding stocks of widely respected companies than it is to hold stocks
<br>
that nobody has heard of. This creates a bandwagon effect.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;People are biased to believe that prices today normally ought to be the same
<br>
as they have been on previous days. This attitude sometimes helps you to
<br>
negotiate a better price when you're trying to buy from a specific person,
<br>
but costs you in anonymous markets. For a good explanation of this phenomenon,
<br>
see:
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;This causes stock prices to be sometimes slow to respond to new information,
<br>
which causes trend following to be good on average. Once investors notice
<br>
that fact, they cause trends to extend too far.
