<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;In the future, people in this country are going to be faced with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice. To become educated, or to starve. Hopefully, the majority of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people choose the former. The argument that cheap labor overseas is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to kill our economy is just garbage. People can move into the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The educated are the ones taking it up the ass, nowadays, not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blue collar folks. Or don't you consider developers, and network
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admins educated? These are the folks whose jobs have been and are
</em><br>

<p>Ayup. Don't know how many programming positions I sent resumes for that
<br>
wound up being outsourced to Indian or Pakistani job shops. Computer
<br>
jobs can be done anywhere there is a computer online. While high tech
<br>
is going more international, blue collar manufacturing is getting more
<br>
nationalist. Manufacturing companies are learning that the grass isn't
<br>
always greener on the other side of the river, that has specifically to
<br>
do with differences between the Anglosphere and the rest of the world.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile, I'm working as a mechanic and  the biggest demand now is
<br>
apparently skilled machinists, which you can't export without exporting
<br>
your whole manufacturing base (they need the machinists where the
<br>
machines are).
<br>
<p>I'm looking at starting a tool company and will most likely have my
<br>
tool designs manufactured here in the northeast, at least until one of
<br>
the big boys wants to buy the rights to the designs. If I get
<br>
manufacturing done overseas, it will be for overseas markets, in which
<br>
case I'll likely sell licenses rather than do the work myself. All I
<br>
can say is thank goodness for GATT. My first tool design will be a must
<br>
for anyone that works on brakes for trucks, buses, or railroad cars,
<br>
but won't fit in the consumer tool market. Since it's a tool for
<br>
professionals, it will have a lifetime warranty, so I need to know that
<br>
it is made to last and not materials or methods substitution occurs.
