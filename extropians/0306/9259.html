<p>Ok, point taken.  But it doesn't answer the question of whether
<br>
robotic &quot;insects&quot; can solve the problem of maintaining the structure
<br>
or whether we should be looking at vessels made of fiberglass
<br>
or eventually nanotube composites where the &quot;maintaining&quot;
<br>
problem will be much less.
<br>
<p>The Europeans are sending a probe to Mars on the cheap today --
<br>
$190 million buys a *lot* of &quot;maintaining&quot; (point being that
<br>
the cost of getting into space buys a *lot* on the Earth's
<br>
surface right now and probably for several decades).  While
<br>
navigation in space is probably easier, I question whether it is
<br>
cheaper after one takes into account the radiation shielding
<br>
required to provide that equivalent to that the atmosphere provides.
<br>
<p>I would say that I want to grow into space nearly as much as
<br>
Greg does -- but I want to live in a colony that has a *lot*
<br>
of water (or better frozen hydrogen, but that is a bit tougher
<br>
to engineer) surrounding it.  And I honestly don't know
<br>
if that makes space a better place to live than international
<br>
waters (in terms of freedom from those who would restrict ones
<br>
freedoms).
