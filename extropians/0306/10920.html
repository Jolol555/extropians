<p><em>&gt; How could you know that there has not been a change of

</em><br>
<p>Yes, this topic may be not as fruitless as it appears, since those who are
<br>
like-minded will tend to remain silent, and others may be silently refining
<br>
their understanding as they observe the discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Many persons with scientific and philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; backgrounds struggle with concepts such as the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; consciousness, personal identity, morality, free will, all of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; sense of &quot;self&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rings true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; This strong sense of &quot;I am me, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; everything outside is not me&quot; seems to prevent one from
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; adopting the wider perspective by which these apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; paradoxical topics become transparent (and then one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; discover and begin working on the next layer of the onion.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But clearly *everyone* is not prevented from adopting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wider perspective. If the wider perspective is more useful,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more valid. more true, then it would seem worth while to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try and mark the trails blazed by these daring lateral thinkers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whose eridition may be greater so that when policy is made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the hand count of politicians more of the average folk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in favour, savvy, or at least less opposed.
</em><br>
<p>How to make progress on these topics?
<br>
<p>On a list such as this, rational debate often tends to devolve into a
<br>
competition to prove who's right rather than cooperation to increase
<br>
bilateral understanding.
<br>
<p>On a list such as this, the same topics arise repeatedly.  Surprisingly to
<br>
some, this rehashing of common topics does not lead to much more effective
<br>
sharing of the acquired wisdom of the group.  In fact just the opposite
<br>
occurs, with old-timers tired of the same old discussions, and newcomers
<br>
must discover the questions and hunt for the answers anew.  (and &quot;reading
<br>
the archives&quot; is grossly inefficient as a learning aid.)
<br>
<p>On many topics, we could have easy access to the following:
<br>
<p>* Identification and classification of most common questions and objections,
<br>
with links to effective arguments and supporting information for each.
<br>
* A collection of thought experiments that can provide a more intuitive
<br>
understanding of difficult concepts.
<br>
* Definitions of pertinent concepts and neologisms.
<br>
* Links to related threads in the forum archives.
<br>
<p>It would be wonderfully effective, in my opinion, while in a discussion on
<br>
the list, or during live chat, to be able to link to a reference in the
<br>
knowledge base to provide clarity and more depth for those who seek it,
<br>
while keeping list traffic at a higher signal to noise ratio.
<br>
<p>There's a need for a repository of extropian and transhuman thinking to
<br>
complement the discussion list, and to be most effective I think it should
<br>
be designed as a collaborative system.  It would require sponsorship.  Is
<br>
this something the ExI board would agree is worthwhile, or would it have to
<br>
be done independently?
<br>
