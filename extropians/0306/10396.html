<p><em>&gt; &gt;Hence, with the use of approximating models, we can get 99% of the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of believing a falsehood without actually doing so.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think you vastly over-estimate the ability of most people to pretend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to believe things that they do not actually believe.  The reason that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution has equipped us with biased beliefs about such things is that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people are actually pretty good at detecting insincerity.
</em><br>
<p>I think you, in turn, vastly underestimate our capacity to become immersed
<br>
in models.  (Er, not the living kind.)  As we all know, it's easy to get
<br>
into the &quot;zone&quot; and forget about crucial details for a while, or, if not
<br>
forget about them, then just let them sink back into our unconscious.
<br>
<p>Ask an average man with an average girlfriend whether he really believes
<br>
his girlfriend is the beautifulest, (in private, of course, and under
<br>
conditions of trust, etc.) and I think he'll concede that, when he
<br>
considers it carefully, she's not the most beautiful girl *in the world*,
<br>
but, you know, she's _close enough_.  Since it's easy enough not to let
<br>
that be a constant factor in your consciousness, it's easy enough to let
<br>
that slide into the background as you engage in close relations.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; You might tell your girlfriend that she is average ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I'd like to call attention to the fact that this is exactly the sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;thing that a person &quot;acting as if&quot; the shared social model were true would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;*not* do.  The obvious disaster cases can be safely avoided 99% of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;time just by being aware of the flaws in our standard intuitions, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;still managing to be polite regardless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your girlfriend will not be satisfied with your being polite and never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bringing up the subject of what you think of her.  She will ask you, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need be.  And she will look closely to see if you believe what you say.
</em><br>
<p>And I'll tell her she's the best.  This isn't a merely hypothetical
<br>
question... this has worked out well in the past.  It'd take a rather
<br>
unusual person, far from the evolutionarily selected norm, to respond to
<br>
&quot;you're the best&quot; with &quot;hah! no I'm not, you're a liar and I'm calling
<br>
your bluff!&quot;  Perhaps a coy denial... ah, but that's all part of the
<br>
delicious game of flirting.
<br>
<p>Anyway, I'd argue, against your claim, that the strategy I describe is, in
<br>
fact, what's used by most people, contra your claim that they are mostly
<br>
self-deceived most of the time.
<br>
<p><p>You, on the other hand, seem to be pursuing a distinctly irrational
<br>
strategy at the moment.  I think if you believe what you say, you should
<br>
stop doing so immediately, on its own terms.  All these dismal truths are
<br>
precisely the sort of thing you argue we're supposed to disbelieve for our
<br>
own good, isn't it?
<br>
<p>In that regard, arguing that the true is anything but what it is right to
<br>
believe is, in a way, self-defeating.  In particular, I consider it a fact
<br>
of ethical logic that, for any X, we shouldn't believe the claim *:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(*) Although X is false, we should believe X anyway.
<br>
<p>Note how this is different from showing directly that * is false: my claim
<br>
is merely that you shouldn't believe *.  But, of course, if you believe my
<br>
argument, then you'll agree with me that * must be false for any X.
<br>
<p><p>I might add that your claim that most people seem to be mostly
<br>
self-deceived about most of what's around them, especially in particular
<br>
areas of discourse, seem vulnerable to (Donald) Davidsonian arguments: I'd
<br>
say that we could not say of a society that we understand what they are
<br>
saying and that they are radically mistaken about most of what they're
<br>
saying.   <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/</a>
<br>
<p>Still too weak for ya? ;)
