<p>
In some ways, however, Egypt might not be that different from the USA 50
<br>
or 60 years ago. I haven't seen Matrix Reloaded yet, but it is obvious
<br>
that this film would have never been produced in the USA until a few
<br>
decades ago (speaking of the social/legal restraints, not technical or
<br>
dramatic ones), and if it had been produced anywhere else would have
<br>
likely not been widely shown here, if at all. It would have been
<br>
censored, just as Egypt censors it today. Back then there were quite a
<br>
number of European films that you couldn't see in the USA because of a
<br>
patchwork of industry regulations and government film censors.
<br>
<p>Under the Production Code observed by the American industry, to some
<br>
extent even into the '60s, any movie challenging conventional religious
<br>
belief was verboten. Some states such as New York required films to be
<br>
licensed before they were shown, and the licensing authority did not
<br>
hesitate to withhold authority from any film containing &quot;sacrilege.&quot;
<br>
They were, apparently, much influenced by church leaders, especially
<br>
Catholics. These clerics and laymen didn't give up anything to the
<br>
current crop of mullahs in their zealotry to control what ideas were
<br>
presented. Religious issues would have almost certainly shot down The
<br>
Matrix back in &quot;the good old days.&quot; 
<br>
<p>The Matrix would also have also been unproduceable and unscreenable in
<br>
the USA because of its use of black characters in leadership roles. And
<br>
finally the suggestion of drug usage when Neo is offered the pills would
<br>
have violated a strict prohibition against even dealing with that whole
<br>
subject, however obtusely.
<br>
