</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Depends on what you mean. According to Mohandas Gandhi, armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; revolt was a possibility he kept firmly in mind. That he wound up
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; emphasizing nonviolence doesn't mean it wasn't also on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Viceroy's mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He said that non-violence was for the really strong and was the superior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; method but that it was better for those less strong to take up arms than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to simply acquiesce to that which is wrong.

has the quote as:
<br>
&quot;I would prefer to see India defend her honor by armed force than to see 
<br>
her stand like a coward, watching her defeat without an attempt to defend 
<br>
herself. But I still believe just as strongly that nonviolence is 
<br>
infinitely superior to violence.&quot;
<br>
<p>He maintained with great force of will that Satyagraha would work; and, as 
<br>
it happened, it did. Had it not worked, there were still armed-force 
<br>
alternatives. I think he remained mindful of that to some degree or other; 
<br>
perhaps &quot;firmly&quot; was the wrong adverb. Mea culpa.
<br>
<p>I also want to point out, in response to the original poser, that the 
<br>
Indian populace was armed--with an idea. And other arms were available as 
<br>
an additional resort. Call that amphigory if you want to.
