Yes that is so.

...And that's more importantly so...unfortunately TMS may encounter a 
<br>
conflict with the first problem because it is looking very effective in 
<br>
treating depression...now the sufferer would have to go for regular 
<br>
sessions, but could come off drugs, and TMS seems to have much fewer 
<br>
side effects than drugs. I don't think drug companies would be too 
<br>
impressed by that concept, so there may be a conflict.

<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;It's not removing guilt, it's removing _the ability to feel guilt_. In

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;my opinion 'guilt' is a symptom of mental disorder due to malfunction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;There is no reason for an intelligent, neurologically healthy person to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;ever feel it. If they have done nothing deliberately that they know to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be bad, what is there to feel guilty about? Mistakes should not invoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;guilt; mistakes happen to everybody and we all know that and accept it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;And if someone is being an a-hole on purpose, they're unlikely to feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;guilty, because they're an a-hole...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Where does that leave a place for guilt, apart from filling you full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;hormones that make you sick and shortening your lifespan?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;While I don't consider longterm guilt at all optimal I think some sense of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;remorse over misdeeds is not necessarily a bad thing.   Clinging to that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;indefinitely isn't healthy.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Why would anything intelligent commit 'misdeeds' to be guilty over? As I 
<br>
said, there is no misdeed in a mistake. Where is the place for guilt? 
<br>
This is a legitimate question. Embarrassment or remorse for not being as 
<br>
bright as we feel we could have been in any given situation, fair 
<br>
enough. We'll learn.  Guilt? Guilt for _what_?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; wiping 'guilt' is not, for me, a misuse of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;technology but part of the cure for a malfunction, so perhaps it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;hasty to use the word 'misuse'? ... a lot of people think stem-cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;cloning is 'misuse'...you know what I mean?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It is certainly subject to misuse though. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Well, I think that applies to almost everything, in it's own way. I 
<br>
could even misuse cheese. I could certainly kill somebody with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;...That's why I asked about the PTSD...ever-increasing guilt about your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;inability to cope, and your inability to stop experiencing horrid things
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;against your will, can utterly destroy your life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;    
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But this is a bit more than your run-of-the-mill guilt over some actual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wrongdoing.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Yes, absolutely. But it is using the same feeling, the same set of 
<br>
hormones, the same networks, as everyday guilt about, say, 'what you 
<br>
said to someone in the middle of last week when you were feeling 
<br>
irritable and they might have misunderstood or thought you were being 
<br>
rude' sort of guilt. What I am saying is that _none_ of this is 
<br>
necessary. Instead of guilt about failing to live up to our standards, 
<br>
we need integrity and determination and resolution to do better; 
<br>
positives; not a negative. The complete removal of the ability to feel 
<br>
guilt is an advantage to intelligence. That's what I'm saying. Give it 
<br>
up, it's bad for your health and it will kill you, is what I'm saying. 
<br>
It's worse for you than smoking, is what I'm saying. Give it up for 
<br>
medical reasons.
<br>
...I'm nagging you now, aren't I?  :  )
<br>
But, what are we addicted to? -If your doctor told you to give up 
<br>
_worrying_ because it was bad for your health for example, would you 
<br>
(could you) comply?
<br>
Best,
<br>
