By all means, there are good reasons to pursue research, which will
<br>
eventually persuade us (especially the good Bayesians) to start developing a
<br>
definite opinion about the reality, extent, causes, economic implications
<br>
and actions to be taken in relation to global warming.  But for now, I side
<br>
with you in having no opinion. The reason for bringing up the subject again
<br>
here is to prod those who already have an opinion to shed their premature
<br>
conviction. And I mean it - really I have no opinion, I neither deny nor
<br>
believe in dangerous anthropogenic climate warming and the need for action,
<br>
because there are insufficient data on the future of our climate.
<br>
<p>Indeed, there is an interesting phenomenon in cognitive science, the
<br>
Bruner-Potter interference. If  a human visual system is exposed to a very
<br>
blurry, incomprehensible version of a photograph, this person will have
<br>
difficulty deciphering a less blurry version of the same image, which is
<br>
already understandable to a person who never saw the very blurry version. It
<br>
is explained by the consumption of perceptual resources by futile hypotheses
<br>
formed during exposure to insufficient data. Your higher visual areas (the
<br>
semantic parsers) are so consumed with a flurry of conflicting hypotheses
<br>
from the too-blurry image that they can't analyze the scene even if
<br>
sufficient data becomes available. The truth is lost in the internal babble
<br>
of your temporoparietal cortex. So it pays to hold off on guessing until you
<br>
know better, especially in cases where upwards of a trillion dollars is the
<br>
down-payment on your decision.
<br>
<p>Also, I plainly hate environmentalists, and I am happy to see them suffer a
<br>
hit.

<em>&gt; Here's a recent view to the contrary; I have no opinion:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By FRED PEARCE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; New Scientist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Smoke is clouding our view of global warming, protecting the planet from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps three-quarters of the greenhouse effect. That might sound like
</em><br>
good
<br>
<em>&gt; news, but experts say that as the cover diminishes in coming decades, we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are in for a dramatic escalation of warming that could be two or even
</em><br>
three
<br>
<em>&gt; times as great as official best guesses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This was the dramatic conclusion reached last week at a workshop in
</em><br>
Dahlem,
<br>
<em>&gt; Berlin, where top atmospheric scientists got together, including Nobel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laureate Paul Crutzen and Swedish meteorologist Bert Bolin, former
</em><br>
chairman
<br>
<em>&gt; of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IPCC scientists have suspected for a decade that aerosols of smoke and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other particles from burning rainforest, crop waste and fossil fuels are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blocking sunlight and counteracting the warming effect of carbon dioxide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emissions. Until now, they reckoned that aerosols reduced greenhouse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warming by perhaps a quarter, cutting increases by 0.2 °C. So the 0.6 °C
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; warming over the past century would have been 0.8 °C without aerosols.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the Berlin workshop concluded that the real figure is even higher -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aerosols may have reduced global warming by as much as three-quarters,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cutting increases by 1.8 °C. If so, the good news is that aerosols have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevented the world getting almost two degrees warmer than it is now. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the bad news is that the climate system is much more sensitive to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; greenhouse gases than previously guessed. [etc]
