<p>I like this analysis. 
<br>
<p>Not many animals have been cloned so far. Can we use Doomsday-style reasoning 
<br>
to conclude that not very many animals will ever be cloned? 
<br>
<p>Consider any other new effective technology, only a few instances of which 
<br>
exist so far, and you'll find Doomsday reasoning leading to the strange 
<br>
conclusion that not very many instances of that great new technology will ever 
<br>
exist. Why does Doomsday reasoning seem misguided in these cases? 
<br>
<p>Doomsday reasoning works fine for independent balls in urns. Pick a small 
<br>
number, and you're more likely to have picked from the less numerous 
<br>
collection. 
<br>
<p>But Doomsday reasoning doesn't seem to work for things that are likely to 
<br>
proliferate themselves and/or be proliferated, such as useful new technologies, 
<br>
and clever new sentient species. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps someone more statistically sophisticated than I can explain more 
<br>
clearly the reason why this is so. Or why it isn't so.
