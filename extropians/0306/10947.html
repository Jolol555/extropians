<p>
Yes this sounds like a great idea: a repository of points of view on subtle
<br>
things like this, were individual entries are written, and peer-reviewed,
<br>
more carefully than when writing a &quot;casual&quot; contribution to the list. For
<br>
example we could have some &quot;standard&quot; points of view on individual identity
<br>
and its `[non] preservation after upload. For such a repository I would wish
<br>
to write a much more articulated account of the half-baked thoughts in my
<br>
last message (this would take days if not weeks). Of course, I may find that
<br>
a good account of my own point of view already exists in the repository.
<br>
Good luck if someone wishes to get the repository started, I look forward to
<br>
contributing. I wonder how many entries we would get on the eternal
<br>
left/right issue.

Subject: Re: Cryonics and uploading as leaps of faith? (was Re: Uploaded
Omniscience)
&gt; There's a need for a repository of extropian and transhuman thinking to
&gt; complement the discussion list, and to be most effective I think it should
&gt; be designed as a collaborative system.  It would require sponsorship.  Is
&gt; this something the ExI board would agree is worthwhile, or would it have
to
&gt; be done independently?
