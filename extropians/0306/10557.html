<p>
When I joined the Extropians List I received an email of useful
<br>
information from E. Shaun, including how to post messages and what 
<br>
behavior was expected from list members.
<br>
<p>A relevant quote is:-
<br>
<p>5d) Rules about fighting and insulting; fighting and insulting
<br>
are not allowed!
<br>
<p>5e) If someone starts a fight with you what should you do?; we have a
<br>
private legal code set-up to handle such disputes which includes a
<br>
judge (the List Administrator) and an adjudicator to handle appeals.
<br>
<p>If someone really annoys you, you can do any of the following:
<br>
1) Nothing - give no response
<br>
2) Respond OFF the list
<br>
3) Make a formal complaint to me asking for a judgment against Person X
<br>
<p>5f) What if you just have to respond to &quot;uphold your honor&quot; or to set
<br>
the &quot;facts/record straight,&quot; or to tell the entire list why you
<br>
will not be speaking or reading posts or messages from the person who
<br>
offended you?
<br>
<p>D O N ' T!
<br>
<p>we consider such responses flames in their own right and you would
<br>
be taking the law into your own hands; you might also be censured or
<br>
removed from the list.
<br>
<p>Remember:
<br>
&nbsp;Don't contribute to or continue a fight once one has started.
<br>
&nbsp;doing so places you in violation of the list rules. That includes
<br>
&nbsp;meta communication, which includes posts with an angry tone, or voice.
<br>
<p>End quote ------------
<br>
<p><p>From this message it would appear that the list rules do not permit 
<br>
Harvey (or anyone) to 'set the record straight' after they perceive that 
<br>
they have been falsely accused.
<br>
<p>So Amara was acting correctly in refusing to respond to her attackers.
<br>
<p>Effectively, these list rules mean that as soon as someone is accused of 
<br>
supporting Sadaam, supporting Communism, seeking the downfall of USA, 
<br>
terrorism, cannibalism, etc. then they should leave the discussion and/or 
<br>
complain to the List Administrator.
<br>
<p>This would be similar to invoking Hitler as ending the discussion.
<br>
<p>Hopefully people who want to discuss political systems will be able to 
<br>
carry on a reasonable discussion. But as soon as they start accusing 
<br>
people of various beliefs or traits that they find objectionable, then 
<br>
the discussion stops. Personal attacks are Ad Hominem.
<br>
It is pointless to carry on attempting to discuss with someone who is 
<br>
making Ad Hominem attacks,
<br>
Do not respond to Ad Hominem attacks!
<br>
Report them to the List Administrator.
<br>
<p>One teensy problem is that apparently we don't have a List Administrator 
<br>
at present. See the mess that gets us into.  :)
<br>
<p>Bring back E.Shaun! At least temporarily to clean the bodies off the 
<br>
battlefield and have a few executions, (pour encourager les autres).
<br>
<p><p>The original quote is by Voltaire in Candide
<br>
<p>Dans ce pay-ci, il est bon de tuer de temps en temps un amiral pour 
<br>
encourager les autres.
<br>
In this country it is good to kill an admiral from time to time, to 
<br>
encourage the others.
<br>
