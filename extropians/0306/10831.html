<em>&gt; Inca may have used knot computer code to bind empire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By Steve Connor, Science Editor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 23 June 2003
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt; 
<br>
<em>&gt; They ran the biggest empire of their age, with a vast network of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roads, granaries, warehouses and a complex system of government. Yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Inca, founded in about AD1200 by Manco Capac, were unique for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a significant civilisation: they had no written language. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has been the conventional view of the Inca, whose dominions at their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; height covered almost all of the Andean region, from Colombia to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chile, until they were defeated in the Spanish conquest of 1532.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But a leading scholar of South American antiquity believes the Inca
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did have a form of non-verbal communication written in an encoded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; language similar to the binary code of today's computers. Gary Urton,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professor of anthropology at Harvard University, has re-analysed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complicated knotted strings of the Inca - decorative objects called
</em><br>
<em>&gt; khipu - and found they contain a seven-bit binary code capable of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conveying more than 1,500 separate units of information.

<br>
Not again, arrgh! Every few years someone comes along and claims to have
<br>
&quot;deciphered&quot; the Inca Quipu (usual spelling: don't know where the
<br>
Independent got &quot;Khipu&quot; from!).
<br>
Always making the same claim: that it's a complex code that substitutes
<br>
for a written language. Always the &quot;decipherer&quot; is a *traditional*
<br>
academic of some form or another; this time it's a Harvard Professor,
<br>
last time it was a senior archaeology student; and the list goes back
<br>
and on as far as the hind can sight.
<br>
<p>Why? Particularly when the quipu system is still in use in the Andean
<br>
mountains and in the 19thC european scholars had the system explained to
<br>
them by Inca descendents. In essence it's a book keeping system.
<br>
Different colours represent different items (Llamas, potatoes, etc) and
<br>
the different knots represent units, 10, 100, and so on (I forget if the
<br>
Inca used base 5, 10, or 20, but for the purposes of illustration I'm
<br>
using base 10 as it's more familiar to us). 
<br>
<p>This was the fashion of the Quipu;
<br>
If, for example, + x O and @ represent different types of knot 
<br>
and ---- represents the central string
<br>
and if;
<br>
+ = 1 
<br>
x = 10
<br>
0 = 100
<br>
@ = 1000
<br>
then 2,403 might be strung as;
<br>
---+++---0000---@@--- 
<br>
or 1,044, might be strung as;
<br>
---++++---xxxx---@---
<br>
(note the absence of a need for zero in this notation system)
<br>
<p>In the Quipu the stringings recorded individual quantities and the
<br>
furthermost strings the totals so
<br>

<br>
LLamas 5   16   4   22  106  37   total 190
<br>
<p>Using Quipu the local temples would keep records of which farmers had
<br>
what stock and produce, the central temples would demand taxes on the
<br>
basis of these records, and the temples would record what was being sent
<br>
and received. The main temples recorded on huge quipu the taxes
<br>
collected, and would add complexity to denote which region, which record
<br>
keeper, which official dealt with this case, which reginal year of which
<br>
king, and if the number was actual, estimated, or wanted (this required
<br>
a few non-numeric knots of mnemonic value but it was a case of priests
<br>
and kings having &quot;personal&quot; knots: as which knot was whose was passed on
<br>
verbally this particular information is lost to us). Andean farmers
<br>
today have personal knots to identify quipus as theirs, and use the
<br>
innovation of the modern calendar to record the year: EG 2002 = 2
<br>
thousand and 2  =  ---++---@@---.
<br>
No Y2K bugs in this system!
<br>
<p>The Mesopotamian cultures used a similar accounting system (of different
<br>
shaped clay objects, backed in a hollow &quot;egg&quot; with pictorial
<br>
representations of the contents scraped into the exterior clay) for
<br>
nearly 4,000 years before they developed a full written language.
<br>
<p>Both cases show one *can* run an empire, and have a civilization,
<br>
without a written language but not without taxation or accountants who
<br>
need a numeric notation system.
<br>
<p>So, again, if the quipus are &quot;understood&quot; as much as they can be, do
<br>
&quot;classically trained&quot; scholars and archaeologists persist in claiming
<br>
year after year that the quipus were much more, and were a full written
<br>
language?
<br>
<p>Well, that's simple. In standard traditional academic thinking a people
<br>
or culture can NOT be *civilised* unless they have writing. In
<br>
traditional academic thought writing is the primary indicator of
<br>
civilization. Moreover, writing being the herald of &quot;History&quot;, most
<br>
traditional academic works will solemnly inform you that civilization
<br>
itself begins with writing.
<br>
<p>The Inca people present a *big* problem to this view, for here was a
<br>
people, a culture, observed and recorded by &quot;civilized&quot; europeans, who
<br>
could pass every single &quot;test&quot; of civilization except one: they'd no
<br>
writing system. Yet they were undeniably civilized by every other
<br>
traditional test thereof.
<br>
<p>There's evidence, in spite of the barrier of the Andes, that the Inca
<br>
were aware of writing in the east by the Aztec and Maya peoples, yet
<br>
they did not adopt these systems.
<br>
The traditional view sees this as evidence for their case. The Inca
<br>
didn't adopt eastern writing systems therefore they *must* have had no
<br>
need for it because they'd an adequate writing system of their own,
<br>
which in turn must be hidden in the &quot;undeciphered&quot; quipu.
<br>
The idea that the Inca may have rejected writing (as did the Celts) for
<br>
social, cultural, religious, and/or political reasons, or that they
<br>
simply saw no need for it as the existing system worked fine without it,
<br>
is not considered.   
<br>
<p>So rather than re-order their world view, or even accept that the Inca
<br>
cast doubt upon the view that writing indivisibly equals civilization,
<br>
the hunt by traditional academics goes on to find a &quot;writing system&quot;
<br>
within the knots of the quipus. Like Buffy &quot;into every generation one is
<br>
born&quot;, and like every &quot;one&quot; before them they will fail, because what
<br>
they seek does not exist, and has no need to exist, for its &quot;necessity&quot;
<br>
exists to justify a definition rather than an actuality.
<br>
<p>Can Archaeologists really be so blind? Well they can. A good example is
<br>
the view once held was that a culture could not develop monumental
<br>
architecture until after they'd invented pottery. In consequence, the
<br>
stone pyramids of the Chavin area were said, because the Chavin had no
<br>
pottery, to have been build by a later people who mysteriously came,
<br>
built their pyramid temples, and left - taking all their pots with them.
<br>
However, scientific dating methods proved that the pyramids were
<br>
contemporary to the Chavin people and the view that pottery precedes
<br>
monumental architecture was wrong. Indeed the pyramids in question are
<br>
contemporary to Egyptian pyramids! (see Richard L Burger's &quot;Chavin and
<br>
the Origins of Andean Civilization&quot;).
<br>
<p>The very Fortean aspect the orthodox view that Writing = Civilization is
<br>
that it spawned the belief that &quot;civilization&quot; began suddenly, almost
<br>
catastrophically fast, with the advent of writing.
<br>
<p>This in turn, with 95 per cent of humanity's time on earth being
<br>
pre-literate, begs the not unreasonable question &quot;If civilization began
<br>
suddenly then where did it come from?&quot;. And thus in turn are spawned the
<br>
&quot;alternative&quot; answers of Ignatious Donnelley (atlantis), Desmond Leslie
<br>
(spacemen), and Piazzi Smith (divine intervention); and the better known
<br>
moderernisers of these views; Graham Hancock, Robert Bauval, Erich Von
<br>
Daniken, Alan Alford, Peter Lemesurier, uncle Tom Cobblers an' all.
<br>
<p>It is a great irony that the platform, without which all these
<br>
alternative explanations fail, or are even justifiable, is orthodox
<br>
archaeological dogma, yet it is archaeological orthodoxy that all these
<br>
alternatives claim must be swept aside in the light of their
<br>
&quot;discoveries&quot;, yet to do so would destroy the very foundations without
<br>
which their own theories are unnecessary and unjustifiable!
<br>
<p>For a fuller exploration of the falsity of the view that civilization
<br>
begins with writing see Richard Rudgley's excellent &quot;Lost Civilizations
<br>
of the Stone Age&quot; and for an account of pre-literate numeric systems,
<br>
their great antiquity, and pre-dating of writing systems, see Georges
<br>
Ifrah's &quot;The Universal History of Numbers&quot;.
