On your points 3 and 4; one might then conclude that the disuasion of 
<br>
radical, militant Islam as practiced by Salafists, Wahabbis, and Shiite Ayatollahs, 
<br>
as well as their Baathist cohorts, would thus be in your interests? The 
<br>
Egyptian government has surely followed the Saudi practice of blame the USA since 
<br>
Sadat's assasination, as a means of deflecting due criticism for failed economic 
<br>
policies. Since nothing seems to be more poweful then power in this old world, 
<br>
what are we to do to disusade militant, radical, Islam (and its non-Muslims 
<br>
supporters) from practicing nuclear guerilla warfare?  There's an old saying 
<br>
that &quot;Nice guys don't win ballgames&quot;, to which I would add, Survival is not a 
<br>
popularity contest, which I would apply this to at least one group in the Middle 
<br>
East.
<br>
<p><p>Mez stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt; 3) My relatives in egypt are members of an oppressed and discriminated
<br>
against minority (egyptian christians).  They are the oppressed rather
<br>
than the oppressors.  From an early age I was taught that Islam is an
<br>
evil religion.  In many ways I hold my current opinions /despite/ my
<br>
upbringing, rather than because of it.
<br>
<p>4) To the extent that I care about the welfare of my relatives in
<br>
Egypt, I would like to see Egypt become more like the US.  I'd like to
<br>
see it become a democracy rather than a dictatorship.  I'd like to see
<br>
it become a modern capitalist society rather than a mostly statist
<br>
one.  &gt;&gt;
