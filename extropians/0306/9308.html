<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmmm. On the carrier I was on there was no hotbunking with a complement of 
</em><br>
5K 
<br>
<em>&gt; men (Kitty hawk, built in the 60s).  But it is possible there was 
</em><br>
hotbunking  
<br>
<em>&gt; in an earlier carrier.  Yes, the compartments often had as many as 100 
</em><br>
people 
<br>
<em>&gt; in them, and the beds were stacked 3 
</em><br>
deep.                                    
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As far as the viability of such a scheme...with extropian type people? 
</em><br>
YIKES! 
<br>
<em>&gt; THat would be a disaster.  We are not all that sociable. I myself had 
</em><br>
a       
<br>
<em>&gt; helluva time being confined that way with so many people. THe ones 
</em><br>
who        
<br>
<em>&gt; actually like it are very sociable 
</em><br>
people.                                    
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My original estimate was obviously somewhat off the cuff. The carrier would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obviously have no need of so much flight support equipment or manpower. 
</em><br>
Didn't
<br>
<em>&gt; know what the original compliment was, my statement was shooting in the 
</em><br>
dark.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If we cut manpower to 500, then single bunk cabins should be de rigeur. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we can eliminate lots of unneeded military and flight ops equipment, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cabin size would increase significantly. At 500, buy in would average at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $20k. Smaller cabins could be let to those wishing to make lots of sweat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equity contributions (i.e. chipping and painting, etc).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then lets imagine a fraction of cabins would be let as time-shares by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; month. $2k per month buy-in is a fantastic time-share rate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then we have to deal with operational costs. This obviously depends on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of propulsion that would be used. Current installation would be fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hungry. One idea I have is that with that big flat deck, we could install a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of scrap airliner wings vertically on pivoting masts. and make it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sailing ship... Extropian Windjammer Cruises, anyone?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p><p>I guess it could possibly work as a commercial venture/lifestyle opportunity, 
<br>
if a bunch of the people were craftsman, machinists, etc.  A carrier actually 
<br>
has lots of cargo space (for the planes, and their parts and fuel, mostly).  
<br>
THe men live in a fraction of the total space.  If you had 500 men with 20K 
<br>
and some mechanical skills, electrical skills, piloting, etc., yeah, global 
<br>
shipping seems to be a growth industry (infortunately for the factory workers 
<br>
of America).
<br>
<p>Fix it up, find manufacturers who need cargo shipped. Of course, there is 
<br>
insurance to consider, but since all the operators would be owners, that 
<br>
would be simplified somewhat.
<br>
<p>I guess the real problem is the hull, and what rusting problems you might 
<br>
have. Now that kind of work is major league stuff.
<br>
<p>Could you get a shot at shipping from 3rd world manufacturers to 
<br>
America/Europe? Maybe....
<br>
<p>This touches tangentially on my kooky ideas about why I think the whole 
<br>
globalization movement is a shaft job on American workers.  There is a LOT of 
<br>
opportunity for Americans who have perhaps modest savings with respect to 
<br>
starting businesses in the 3rd world. But when &quot;free trade&quot; agreements are 
<br>
created, it is always only the big businesses that get the shot at the 3rd 
<br>
world.
