40% efficiency is interesting if true. I wonder how noisy it is...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A new design for an engine has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a quintessentially British origin

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ENGINES have been spluttering along in more or less the same way for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decades. Most motor vehicles still rely on one of two sorts of piston- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal combustion engine, both conceived over 100 years ago (by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nikolaus
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otto and Rudolf Diesel). Turbine engines are similarly ancient. Even one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the more recent innovations, the pulsed jet engine, which injects gobbets 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fuel into a combustion chamber to create intermittent pulses of power, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its debut as far back as the second world war. It formed the motor of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; V1
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flying bombs launched by Germany against Britain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, a father-and-son team of inventors from Suffolk, in Britain, hopes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revolutionise engine technology with a new design for an ultra-efficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engine. John and Laurie Archer have been spending their spare time hidden
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away, in true British inventors' tradition, in a shed at the bottom of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; garden. There, they have designed a motor that can run on natural gas,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; methane from landfills, or hydrogen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; After ten years of hard work, a prototype made in part from a child's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction kit, and many patent applications, they have licensed their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design to a Dutch technology group called ICCU Holdings. ICCU is putting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; together a consortium to develop the engine, and plans to use the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Archers'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design to build generators that will provide clean, green power units for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; housing estates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All engines work on the principle of burning fuel in a confined space and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; using the resulting rise in pressure to generate mechanical energy. In an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Otto or Diesel engine, large losses of energy arise from incomplete
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combustion of the fuel. Further waste comes from losses to friction and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; noise as the pistons are driven up and down. As a result, the average car
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engine burns four times more fuel than it would need to move the vehicle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were it as efficient as the laws of thermodynamics permit. By contrast,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turbine engines, such as those used in aircraft, waste only about one- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; third
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the fuel they burn. They do so because rotation is smoother than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up-and-down motion of pistons, and also because they are able to suck in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vast amounts of air and thus burn the fuel with a lot of oxygen, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that combustion is more or less complete.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The ³Archer-Trice² engine, as it is known, combines pulse jets with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; turbines. John Archer describes the engine as looking like a propeller in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doughnut. In the Archer-Trice engine, gaseous fuel is fed into a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cylinder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which then rotates to compress the space in which the gas is held. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design of the rotor gives the air intake a large ³swept volume²‹in other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, a vast amount of air is sucked in, even though the engine itself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stationary. A sparking plug ignites the gas, providing the pulse which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produces power to turn the cylinder. The compressed burning gas is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; released
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through the exhaust.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Water is injected into the system to produce steam, providing a way of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooling the engine (which, in a moving machine, is another of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; services
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provided by the airstream). And the engine is computer-controlled to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ensure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all the stages are timed to perfection and that it operates at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maximum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficiency. Currently, the engine is around 40% efficient, and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Archers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope to improve on this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; John and Laurie Archer are both electrical engineers, and have always 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in how engines work. But their decision to try to design their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own engine came after they built a D-type Jaguar car together in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1980s.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ³We realised that the car engine was hugely inefficient and thought we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to make something better,² says John Archer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What may once have seemed like a crazy idea is now being taken seriously. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moment, the Netherlands imports much of its electricity from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighbouring countries, meaning that a significant amount of energy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wasted in transmission. ICCU is keen to develop a more efficient and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environmentally friendly power supply, and the Archer-Trice engine could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide a solution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The firm is investing several million euros in the project, and within 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; months it hopes to use the Archer-Trice design to produce an efficient,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural-gas-fuelled generator capable of powering 1,000 homes. As a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bonus,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the steam from the cooling system can be used to heat the homes, instead 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being wasted. If all goes to plan, ICCU will be able to set up a network 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; local generators that will reduce reliance on large power stations. They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even be able to sell surplus power back to the national grid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the meantime, John and Laurie Archer are still refining their engine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design and waiting for the day when Archer-Trice engines are taken up by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; car industry. That may be a while coming. But you never know. Perhaps in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another 100 years the name ³Archer² will stand alongside those of Otto 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Diesel in the history books and maintenance manuals.
