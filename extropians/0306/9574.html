I said (amongst other things, to properly quote Emlyn):
<br>
<p><em>&gt;This is even more appalling when one considers that every civilian life
</em><br>
lost in Iraq could've been saved had Saddam Hussein simply relinquished
<br>
power by the time of the U.S. imposed deadline.
<br>
<p>To which Emlyn responds:
<br>
<p>&quot;This is the second time you've said this in the last day or two. You don't
<br>
also say &quot;This is even more appalling when one considers that every civilian
<br>
life lost in Iraq could've been saved had the coalition of the willing not
<br>
attacked in the first place.&quot; Why not?&quot;
<br>
<p>The answer to that is very simple. The causes of the Coalition to remove 
<br>
Saddam Hussein from power and Hussein's quest to continue his murderous, 
<br>
dictatorial regime are not morally equivalent. Again, you seem to be suggesting that 
<br>
had the Coalition not attacked Iraq, then no killings of any kind would have 
<br>
occured, as opposed to the daily doses of state sanctioned murder that was one of 
<br>
the Hussein regimes distinguishing traits.
<br>
<p>One can say &quot;I'm no fan of Hussein&quot; and despise (or claim to) every facet of 
<br>
his rule until they're blue in the face, but ultimately such attitudes endorse 
<br>
a status quo that permits unending human suffering. As fellow extropian Matus 
<br>
likes to say &quot;No one is free until everyone is free.&quot;
<br>
<p>And as Churchill once said, &quot;I choose not to be impartial between the fireman 
<br>
and the fire.&quot;
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
