Harvey Newstrom asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;On a personal note:  You probably think I am anti-George because of my
<br>
frequent liberal-leaning rants.  I am not sure that I have ever felt the
<br>
need to oppose bin-Laden in this group.  It never seemed to come up or be
<br>
disputed among us.  Do you therefore believe I am a bin-Laden supporter?
<br>
Isn't that what your logic demands?  Is that really what you think?  Do you
<br>
really think that conclusion is accurate and supportable based on evidence?
<br>
I really am not following your logic here.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>One can either limit discussion to technical forecasts of the future, chat 
<br>
about the Singularity, or discuss the world as it is. If you wish to limit 
<br>
discussion to technical progress, I am fine with that; hence my daily sends of 
<br>
articles I find on the web, in order to enhance technical discussions. 
<br>
<p>If you wish to enter the fray of world politics, where people unto this very 
<br>
hour, get hurt and killed. Thus, there is then the notion that whom you 
<br>
support or oppose, or are indifferent to constitutes who you are. You may disagree 
<br>
with this concept, and, of course, on a mailing list, you can absolutely ignore 
<br>
it. But in the real world, it will make a difference in how people view you 
<br>
or I, as unfair as that seems.
<br>
<p>For example, if your are indifferent on Bin Laden, or a supporter, or 
<br>
sympathize with his cause, that will make a difference on how I view your attitude on 
<br>
other matters. Furthermore, anyone who was neutral on Osama, or favorable 
<br>
towards his kith and kin, are people who, by definition, are mine enemy. 
<br>
<p>A lot of this has to do with what Dr. Martin Luther King called &quot;a raising of 
<br>
consciousness.&quot;  If one is indifferent, frequently it isn't awareness, its 
<br>
mere disinterest.
