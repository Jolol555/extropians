<p>Nano-coated implants cut MRI scan dangers 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<br>
Two years ago, a patient in a British hospital died of heart failure shortly 
<br>
after being given an MRI brain scan. 
<br>
<p>Despite being asked several times, he had failed to tell doctors that a heart 
<br>
pacemaker was implanted in his chest. The scanner's powerful radio waves are 
<br>
thought to have induced inappropriate voltages in the implant - boosting the 
<br>
patient's pulse so much his heart failed.
<br>
<p>MRI images are invaluable. Their ability to show up different densities of 
<br>
soft tissue is particularly useful in cancer diagnosis. But the risk of such 
<br>
accidents means they cannot be used on patients who have implants that contain 
<br>
any kind of metal. This is becoming a serious problem as more people are fitted 
<br>
with implants to control various conditions.
<br>
<p>But now a US company has come up with a new coating for implants that should 
<br>
protect such patients from dangerous MRI scanner fields. And there could be 
<br>
spin-offs for everyone if this paves the way for the routine use of MRI scanners 
<br>
during surgery - an activity currently prevented by the use of metal surgical 
<br>
tools
