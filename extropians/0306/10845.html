<p>Maybe I haven't followed closely, but what exactly are these trusted
<br>
devices? Transparency in the manufacturing department, at the required
<br>
degree, seems to require a transparent society that is not going to appear
<br>
in a short timeframe. Or maybe I'm simply misunderstanding what you say

<p><em>&gt;quantitative measure of the ability to indulge wishes, i.e. freedom). Such

<em>&gt;Ah, well, maybe this idea's time will come eventually.

<p>It's a sign of the time that someone like me, often cheering for the
<br>
Greens in their battles, thinks about the opposite approach of opening
<br>
oceans and air to private property, and finds it at least sensible. Argh.
<br>
We live in interesting times.
