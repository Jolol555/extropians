<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/invention/program.html">http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/invention/program.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for example.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the link Hal, I would not have intuitively gone 
<br>
looking for this stuff with a keyword like Sumeria.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your invention is given such an order, you not only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't get the patent, you aren't allowed to make or use
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  the invention, or to tell anyone about it.  One reference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I found from the 1980s suggested that there were several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousand patent secrecy orders in effect in the United 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; States at that time, many of them relating to cryptography.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Yeah I was hoping to collect a few declassified historic 
<br>
examples of these but the Australia patent office guy I'd
<br>
been speaking though he recollected but could not put
<br>
his fingure on a specific example.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One way to avoid a patent secrecy order is to not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patent your idea. 
</em><br>
<p>Yep. But at this stage although there is much in patent
<br>
law that is ripe for revision the most optimal (fastest) 
<br>
paths to actualising transhumanist technologies that I can
<br>
think of rely on the use of patents to secure funding in scale.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as I know, there is no comparable procedure to hush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up your invention if  you don't patent it.  Of course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain areas such as  nuclear research are &quot;born
</em><br>
<em>&gt; classified&quot; and you can't start selling nuclear reactors.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's possible that eventually nanotech and similar 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies will be treated like nuclear work, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something illegal unless done under government
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  supervision.
</em><br>
<p>That this will happen with nanotech and cryptography
<br>
strong enough to withstand governmental economic 
<br>
imperialism is my current concern. 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
