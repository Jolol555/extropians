<p>
Don't know much about biology, but I've been searching out images of
<br>
biological macromolecules and nanomachines.  I've been trying to get a
<br>
feel for how things work at the nanometer to micron scale, for how the
<br>
world is.  It is in many ways bewilderingly different from our own world,
<br>
but there are points of contact.
<br>
<p>The Protein Data Bank, <a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/</a>, is the main repository
<br>
for protein structures.  There are a number of free viewers which
<br>
can read PDB files and display them interactively.  I was able to get
<br>
the Chime plug-in to work with an old Netscape browser I still had.
<br>
<a href="http://www.imm.org/Parts/MolVis.html">http://www.imm.org/Parts/MolVis.html</a> describes several of the viewers,
<br>
and also has links to a few large nanotech designs stored as PDB files.
<br>
<p>The PDB has an educational poster that shows a number of important
<br>
biomolecules scaled up 3 million times.  This makes the atoms just
<br>
visible as small dots.  The poster shows a cell membrane with several
<br>
receptors and channels poking through it; DNA being worked on by various
<br>
protein complexes; the ribosome with some of its associated molecules;
<br>
actin and myosin fibers, microtubules; antibodies; even a rhinovirus.
<br>
They have a small version of the poster online at
<br>
<a href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/molecules/poster_quickref.pdf">http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/molecules/poster_quickref.pdf</a>, and you can request
<br>
a big one about 20 by 30 inches if you send a request with your name
<br>
and address to info@rcsb.org.
<br>
<p>I've got the poster hanging on my wall now, and it's simultaneously
<br>
intriguing and frustrating.  At this scale a typical 1 micron bacterium
<br>
would be about 3 meters in diameter; maybe the size of a bus.  There's
<br>
room for lots and lots of complexity at the scale we are looking at
<br>
in these pictures.  The frustrating part is that it is so hard to tell
<br>
what anything does, just by looking at it.  Some things do make sense,
<br>
the cell channels, the fibers, maybe some of the DNA machines.  But the
<br>
ribosome is a total mystery, it's just a couple of blobs.  And with
<br>
the small molecules there's no way to tell what's a poison and what's
<br>
absolutely crucial to life.
<br>
<p>I found another web site with some amazing graphics of the bacterial
<br>
flagellum.  This is the corkscrew-shaped &quot;propeller&quot; that sticks out
<br>
of some kinds of bacteria and spins to move it along through the water.
<br>
The flagellar motor is interesting in itself, but this site focuses on
<br>
how the flagella are assembled.  They are many times longer than the
<br>
bacterium itself, and it turns out that they grow outside the bacterium,
<br>
growing from the tip.  The inside of the flagellum is hollow, and the
<br>
main flagellum protein, flagellin or F41, is sent down the tube from
<br>
the bacterium until it comes out the hollow end.
<br>
<p>The flagellum has 11-fold symmetry, built from repeating units of this
<br>
flagellin protein in a spiral pattern, but at the end there is a cap
<br>
with 5-fold symmetry.  This means that the cap doesn't fit evenly and
<br>
there is one part which is stretched.  As the flagellin molecules come
<br>
out the end, this asymmetry in the cap acts as a sorting engine and
<br>
makes sure they come to rest in the next available spot.
<br>
<p>The site has some amazing graphics that make all this very clear.  It is
<br>
at <a href="http://www.npn.jst.go.jp/">http://www.npn.jst.go.jp/</a>.  Click on the Movies link; they have five
<br>
pages which show how the flagellum is organized and then how it is built.
<br>
The last one is the most impressive and really sums it all up.
<br>
<p>One last site I'll mention is the home page of David Goodsell of Scripps
<br>
Institute, <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/pub/goodsell/">http://www.scripps.edu/pub/goodsell/</a>.  He has a painting of a
<br>
macrophage engulfing a bacterial cell that is incredible in its detail.
<br>
At first it just looks like a jumble, but if you read the captions on
<br>
some of his other paintings on the site, you can start to pick things
<br>
out.  It helps to use the PDB PDF file above as a guide for some of it.
<br>
It shows how crowded and busy these cells are.  It's not just water with
<br>
a few impurities.
<br>
<p>Goodsell is coming out with a book, Bionanotechnology, Lessons from
<br>
Nature.  The cover, <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/pub/goodsell/books/bionanotech.gif">http://www.scripps.edu/pub/goodsell/books/bionanotech.gif</a>,
<br>
shows a DNA molecule passing through a Drexlerian bearing ring.  But
<br>
the book is really about natural biological nanomachines.  His Chapter 1
<br>
excerpt begins:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nanotechnology is available, today, to anyone with a laboratory and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imagination. You can create custom nanomachines using commercially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available kits and reagents. You can design and build nanoscale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assemblers that synthesize interesting molecules. You can construct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tiny machines that seek out cancer cells and kill them. You can build
</em><br>
<em>&gt; molecule-size sensors for detecting light, acidity or trace amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poisonous metals. Nanotechnology is a reality today, and nanotechnology
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is accessible with remarkably modest resources.
</em><br>
<p>Sounds like a must-read book!  BTW I've ordered volume 2 of Robert
<br>
Freitas' Nanomedicine, but it has been delayed from its May shipping date.
<br>
I think they're saying July now.  I'll try to provide a review once I
<br>
receive it.
