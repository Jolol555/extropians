<p><em>&gt; Brett,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       A theory has been going around this list that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list is operated by a clique.  To this date I have resisted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the theory and denied its validity.  I did this partially just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because I didn't want to believe its truth.
</em><br>
<p>As I understand it the list is operated (in the sense that it is
<br>
maintained and it's health is monitored) by the ExI Board 
<br>
and at present, primarily by Natasha. People who have
<br>
all invested their time in building something worthwhile. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;      My personal belief was that a majority that closely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shared the same political convictions was warring with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone that attempted to maintain any position to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contrary.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;      The distinction I was making was the one made by
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Gatto.  Gatto states that a conspiracy is not necessary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when a group with the same bias exists.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       I can live with a Gatto type situation but you have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone a long way to convince me I was wrong. 
</em><br>
<p><p>Then I apologise to you. My clumsy post seems to have
<br>
contributed to an impression that I don't hold to be true.
<br>
<p>BTW:  I Googled on Gatto and got 200,000 hits. Are 
<br>
you referring to John Taylor Gatto? 
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
