Brett Paatsch,  Wed Jun 11:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But could you *smell* anything? I imagine the dangers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;passive smoking would take on whole new meaning as well.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, you can smell sulfur. However the smell wasn't overwhelming,
<br>
probably because the viewers were (forcefully) kept far away from the
<br>
rockfalls and flows.
<br>
<p>The sulfur smell from our viewing point wasn't as strong as the
<br>
sulfur on Etna (I hear, I still must go there) or as strong as on Vulcano
<br>
(which is overwhelming from the fumeroles and sulfur mud baths, see
<br>
below).
<br>
<p>The visitors to the Stromboli volcano, including the
<br>
seismologists(!), who need to get to the top to retrieve their
<br>
broken equipment, are now forbidden to go to the top by the Italian
<br>
Civil Defense and the Guardia di Finanzia. They seem to think that
<br>
the biggest danger is the volcano, when actually it is the tsunamis.
<br>
The highest that the hikers are allowed to go now is halfway up to
<br>
400m. From those observational points you can still see and hear a
<br>
spectacular scene, but the smells are weak.
<br>
<p>On Vulcano, which has been dormant for ~100 years, fumeroles of
<br>
sulfur rise all along the top of the volcano (concentric rings of
<br>
explosions). The vents are burning hot, so you don't want to get
<br>
your feet too close, or your camera lens either (corrosion). You
<br>
will find signs at the beginning of the hiking trail telling you not
<br>
to stand still or sit down, otherwise you will be overwhelmed from the
<br>
fumes. My friends with me tried an experiment dripping water onto
<br>
the hot sulfur vents to see if we could create sulfur dioxide, but
<br>
didn't notice any changes.
<br>
<p>Down below from the Vulcano peak, you will find sulfur mud baths and
<br>
other warm bubbly pools, which are popular for health reasons- the
<br>
mud is supposed to be good for your skin and various other ailments.
<br>
It was a rare time during that trip that I wore a swimsuit, and the
<br>
sulfur smell on that suit will now linger forever (my suit is
<br>
probably destroyed). Interestingly, the sulfur stink disappears from
<br>
the skin after a good shower.  The mud baths part was as fun for the
<br>
bath-watching as it was for the slimy, smelly mud. I took some
<br>
photos of the ladies (Sirens of the Mud Bath, I called them), and my
<br>
friend did too- they were wonderfully enjoying themselves. His
<br>
photos will be available at the stromboli.net web site sometime in
<br>
the next few weeks.
<br>
<p>There were no Civil Defense or Guardia di Finanzia at Vulcano, but I
<br>
hear they are present at Etna, restricting access to the top now.
<br>
The Guardia di Finanzia (the Tax Police), did look a bit out of
<br>
place at Stromboli- their uniforms were immaculate; their shoes,
<br>
shiny  too.
<br>
<p>(I think that there must be an unwritten law in Italy that says that
<br>
you can do whatever you want, as long as you look good).
<br>
<p>Of course my curiosity for why the Tax Police were risking dirtying
<br>
their shoes on the peak at Stromboli piqued my interest and I looked
<br>
further into the strange situation. Historically, they are the police
<br>
force that has the most mountaineering experience, so when Italy
<br>
needs a group of people with a particular skill, it looks at what it
<br>
has, and selects the group with those skills, no matter what
<br>
is their mandated function today.
<br>
<p>A sidetrack about police in Italy.
<br>
<p>Italy has the highest number of policemen per inhabitant in Europe
<br>
and the greatest number of different police forces. Their functions
<br>
overlap -- it would not be unusual to find several different police
<br>
appearing at the scene of a traffic accident, for example. Each
<br>
can stop you for any infringement of the law, they don't cooperate
<br>
with each other very well (they are supposed to), and competitive
<br>
elements and friction appears between the different forces (perhaps,
<br>
a good thing under the circumstances).
<br>
<p>There are three -national- police forces in Italy:
<br>
<p>1) the Cararbinieri (under the control of the Ministry of Defence).
<br>
They are highly militarized, the best dressed (they wear Armani
<br>
uniforms), used to be an all-male police force until just a few
<br>
years ago, they have a well-trained, anti-terrorist group, plus a
<br>
calvary division with some of the best horsemen in Italy, who win
<br>
prizes every year.
<br>
<p>These policemen, in particular, seem to be considered like clowns,
<br>
Italians joke about them alot, and they have their own TV show.
<br>
<p>1) &quot;Why do the carabinieri have a red strip up the side of their
<br>
trousers?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;To help them find their pocket&quot;
<br>
<p><p>2) the State Police, Polizia, (under the Ministry of Interior, i.e.
<br>
Home Affairs). Their headquarters are at the questura, and among
<br>
their functions is to issue permits of stay to foreigners (I finally
<br>
received mine- after 5 months, and it contained mistakes). The State
<br>
Police was also a military body until twenty years ago when they
<br>
became a civilian police force, when the intention was that they
<br>
would become closer to the public. Their behavior is generally rude
<br>
and unpleasant, and if they want to get your attention, they will
<br>
wave a red-and-white paddle at you. There are a few thousand fewer
<br>
poliziotti than carabineieri, but they have more women.
<br>
<p>3) la Guardia di Finanzia (under the ministry of Finance). This was
<br>
the first example in Italy of a special Corps specifically
<br>
established (1772, under  Victor Amedeus III, King of Sardinia) and
<br>
organized for financial surveillance duties along the borders, as
<br>
well as for the military defence of  the frontiers. They function
<br>
more like a Tax Police and combatting smuggling, now, but they
<br>
fuzzily do other things, such as civil defense and guarding
<br>
volcanos.
<br>
<p>All of the national police forces are well-armed.
<br>
<p>Add to these three, -local- police forces:
<br>
<p>- the Coast Guard,
<br>
- the Prison Guards,
<br>
- the Corpo Forestale dello Stato,
<br>
- and the Vigili Urbani (municipal police, who give speeding tickets,
<br>
parking tickets, they also control commercial establishments to see
<br>
if they are opening and closing according their licence etc.)
<br>
<p>Hopkinson gives the reason (1) for this abundance of police forces
<br>
being that, after World War II, the allies did not want Italy to
<br>
build up a large army. This reason sounds a little fishy to me
<br>
because the origin of some of the police forces is old,
<br>
but anyway, it's food for thought.
