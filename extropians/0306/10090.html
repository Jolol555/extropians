Shade opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;First, thats one fundamentalist party leader (of which there
<br>
are many); Second, that are moderate &quot;fundamentalist&quot; party
<br>
leaders that don't agree with him and declared his jihad to
<br>
be wrong... Ergo my point that equating fundamentalism and an
<br>
American body count is not a valid 1-to-1 mapping...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>1) Islam, by its nature is a fundamentalist religion. The closest thing to 
<br>
progressive Islam, are the Sufi's who practice a kind of ecstatic 
<br>
&quot;Pentacostalist&quot; dancing rituals.
<br>
<p>2) Before this administration came to power, the Islamists, who seem to be in 
<br>
charge of things in Islam nowadays; have advocated attacks against the United 
<br>
States. In fact, the war against the US is a war against US ideas, and 
<br>
culture, because the Islamists view it as undermining the faith of their people by 
<br>
corruption. 
<br>
<p>The current example is the violence between Iranian students and the 
<br>
vigilante's now attempting to break up demonstrations in Tehran, unto this very hour. 
<br>
You can also view, if you care to, OSB's declaration of war against &quot;Crusaders 
<br>
and Jews&quot; that was published on the web, in 1998. Before that was the attacks 
<br>
on westerners by the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, starting in the early 
<br>
1960's, as a means of purifying the 
<br>
perceived corruption of the Gamal Abdul Nasser regime, with its cozy 
<br>
relationship with the Soviets, and Europeans.
<br>
<p>You may heave brickbats at America (those politicians sure do love dat old 
<br>
debbil oil, and love to be advisors to the Wahabbi kingdom), but the chief 
<br>
responsibility of how Muslims behave, lies within themselves. Making the US jump 
<br>
through hoops to placate the Islamic (read Islamist) world appears merely 
<br>
encourage more violent and intolerant behavior from Islam. Remember the quote from 
<br>
Osama regarding how people like the stronger horse? 
<br>
<p>To get back to the Thread Topic, I am not sure everything should be defined 
<br>
as Extropian or not. Was the Great Revolution of 1688 in Britain, Extropian? 
<br>
How about the 1832 creation of the Third Republic in France? Its not like apples 
<br>
and oranges, its like apples and LVAD's. 
<br>
<p>Finally, if no nerve gas or biotoxins can be found in Iraq, or found that 
<br>
they have been sent to Syria (for example) then we have been subjected to a Wag 
<br>
The Dog lie from Bush. I suspect that Bush is hiding the fact that Syria took 
<br>
the stuff in question, as a means to cajole the Syrians into joining the team. 
<br>
I could be wrong, but its just a hunch. In this case, a lie is still a lie, 
<br>
even if its for a &quot;good&quot; reason. If these allegations are proven true, Bush 
<br>
should no longer be given carte blanche on foreign policy. Because if they lied, 
<br>
then every claim now needs to be scrutinized, because if he's going to lie 
<br>
once, he's going to lie again.
