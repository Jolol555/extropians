<p>Fair enough, lead times would be a consideration. But 
<br>
presumably the lead times on weapons construction are not
<br>
greater for the US than for other nations. And I'd imagine 
<br>
that the US intel would (should?) be capable of picking up
<br>
on weapons programs and increased spending of potential
<br>
adversaries pretty quickly. 
<br>
<p>So I guess the question becomes, if you are part way 
<br>
through developing a weapon or weapons system in the
<br>
US and have sunk costs and you find that the weapon 
<br>
system is not going to have any real practical application
<br>
do you keep throwing good money after bad? 
<br>
<p>I'm wondering if the US Govt is employing a bit of Keynesian 
<br>
economics. Keeping the economy going by generating 
<br>
weapons in this case that are not relevant but that people and
<br>
industry know how to make. I really don't know that this is
<br>
the case. I'm just wondering.
<br>
<p>The notion of Australia, with all its major cities around the
<br>
coast buying a nuclear defence shield seems to defy all
<br>
logic except maybe political logic.
