</em><br>
<em>&gt;...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's one thing to admit the philosophical possibility that there are

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It would be nice if what you said were true, but alas I think it is 
<br>
not.  We actually usually follow the rule &quot;Just be Natural&quot;.  Evolution has 
<br>
equipped us with vast and complex habits of thought, which people mostly 
<br>
just use without understanding them.  This isn't a particularly dangerous 
<br>
strategy for the usual evolutionary reasons: your ancestors did pretty well 
<br>
following these habits, so you probably will to.
<br>
<p>If you are thoughtful and try to evaluate these inherited habits of 
<br>
thought, you will find that some of them seem to be biased, systematically 
<br>
leading away from truth relative to some other habits you can imagine.  But 
<br>
if you think more about these biases you can see that they are plausibly in 
<br>
your self interest; you can see why evolution might have given you such 
<br>
habits of thought.  At this point you must choose between the safe route of 
<br>
just continuing with the standard biased inherited habits of thought, or 
<br>
taking the chance of using less-tried habits that seem to you to be less 
<br>
biased, but which would probably have harmed your ancestors, and may well 
<br>
harm you as well.
<br>
<p>For example, we have the habit of over-estimating our popularity and 
<br>
abilities, thinking ourselves to be better lovers and drivers than we 
<br>
are.  We know that the best salespeople honestly believe in their product, 
<br>
so we allow ourselves to believe in whatever product we are supposed to 
<br>
sell.  When we &quot;fall in love&quot; we believe that we have found a very good 
<br>
match that will last a long time, consistently over-estimating such 
<br>
things.  We find it easy to believe that our in-group is more able and 
<br>
morally justified that out-groups.  We consistently have persistent 
<br>
disagreements with others, believing ourselves to be right more often in 
<br>
such disagreements, when in fact we are only right as often as others.
<br>
<p>We do all these things without thinking about them.  They are 
<br>
natural.  They are safe strategies.  Once you realize that they are biased 
<br>
habits of thoughts, you can just say isn't that interesting, then forget 
<br>
about it and go on with your life as usual.  Or you can decide that truth 
<br>
is really important to you, and take the chance of violating these standard 
<br>
habits, substituting less tried social strategies which may well have great 
<br>
personal costs.
<br>
<p>You might tell your girlfriend that she is average among the girlfriends 
<br>
you have had, and that you think you are likely to stay with her for the 
<br>
average time.  You might admit you are an average lover and driver, that 
<br>
the products you sell are average, and that your in-group is no more 
<br>
morally justified than any other group.  You might rarely disagree, and 
<br>
accept that others are right as often as you.  You might admit that you 
<br>
care almost nothing about poor people in Africa.
<br>
<p>When you do so, the likely consequences are that people will consider you 
<br>
less able, less caring, and less loyal, then they otherwise would.  They 
<br>
may choose to associate with you less because of this.  Now maybe they will 
<br>
also realize that you seem to be especially truth-oriented, and want to 
<br>
keep you around because you can provide instrumental benefits of 
<br>
truth.  But they may not care about the truth near as much as they care 
<br>
about loyalty, and your ability to accomplish most of your other goals in 
<br>
life will be thereby diminished.  That may be acceptable if you put a high 
<br>
enough value on truth, but otherwise it may not be.
