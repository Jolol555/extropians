<br>
which I would add, Survival is not a popularity contest, which I would apply this 
<br>
to at least one group in the Middle East.
<br>
<p>Spudboy,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You might review the bidding in this game also.  The so called Moslem's 
<br>
in the middle east have bombed our ships.  When one of those countries invaded 
<br>
a 2nd and threatened a 3rd we went over to help.  We ran Sadaam back into his 
<br>
own country and were fully sensitive to their Islamic sensitivities in the 
<br>
process.  If it we whipped anyone it was in their defense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After more injuries inflicted on us we sent a reported 185 men on the 
<br>
ground in Afghanistan and ran both the Taliban and the Al Qaida out of the 
<br>
country.  When Sadaam would not comply with the UN ultimatum to prove he had no 
<br>
WMDs we removed him with ridiculous ease.  In all the combat we had in that 
<br>
country we did not kill anywhere near as many people as Sadaam killed in peacetime.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, that we have begun working to rebuild Iraq we are getting guerilla 
<br>
volunteers from all the surrounding countries including Egypt trying to slow 
<br>
or prevent the rebuilding of Iraq. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would they do that?  Those &quot;volunteers&quot; are in Iraq with the 
<br>
approval of their governments just as they were in Afghanistan.  If you read the 
<br>
media over the last two years you will find that the leaders, Egypt especially, 
<br>
are trying desperately to hold the lid on before they are either chased out of 
<br>
country or left swinging from a lamp pole.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet the best advice MEZ can give us is not to send so many bombs and 
<br>
missiles.  What bombs and missiles?  We have sent them on fewer occasions against 
<br>
them than they have against us.  Certainly the number is very close but 
<br>
always in reply to assault from them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first MEZ gave his advice because he was a middle easterner and 
<br>
therefore held special expertise.  Now he is a poor Egyptian Christian that hasn't 
<br>
been in the country since he was 3 years old.  At first he lambasted the US 
<br>
and its policies, now he is a loyal American and I mustn't criticize him.  
<br>
Frankly, I am confused.  It is like listening to a windshield wiper -- flip, flop, 
<br>
flip, flop.  Only one thing is consistant with him, everything he says is 
<br>
detrimental to our country, IMHO.
