</em><br>
<p>It may be worth noting that &quot;The Hunger Project&quot; has noted for a
<br>
decade, probably more, that one of the keys to ending hunger is
<br>
empowering women.  Men, in most cultures, particularly those
<br>
where there may be religious support for a male superior role,
<br>
are not likely to give up that traditional power dominance easily.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why is this misleading propaganda credible though? (Or is it - I know it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't in Iran but don't know about Egypt or the ME proper.)
</em><br>
<p>It is going to become less so as the internet spreads (governments
<br>
can't control foreign media) unless a government enacts very strict
<br>
&quot;filtering&quot; policies as they have tried to do in China.  But those are
<br>
doomed to failure as well.
<br>
<p>One of the most interesting things that the U.S. could do is to launch
<br>
a satellite system to provide an alternate point of view to Al Jazeera.
<br>
Esp. if they could get it to be managed by an an &quot;independent&quot; group (the
<br>
Japanese or Russians perhaps???).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again I agree that &quot;soft power&quot; is the best strategy. However if undermining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religious fundamentalism is one of the aims doesn't this involve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disseminating what are ultimately anti-religious notions (memes if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prefer)?
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps one should divide the problem into 2 categories --
<br>
a) Those people attracted to &quot;radical&quot; ideas out of frustration or boredom
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or poverty or some other lack of a better opportunity; and
<br>
b) Those people attracted to &quot;radical&quot; ideas because they *really* believe
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in their religion/cause/etc.
<br>
<p>People in the (a) category one can reason with and if one can improve
<br>
conditions perhaps eliminate as a threat.  People in the (b) category
<br>
are essentially irrational (at least from my perspective) and should
<br>
be dealt with the way you deal with any &quot;crazy&quot; person (realizing of
<br>
course that this varies between societies depending on their resources).
