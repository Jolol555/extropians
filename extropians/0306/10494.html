</em><br>
<p>Cool. I guess the little that is happening that is healthy
<br>
is an acceptable loss considering.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I imagine we are probably building up a catalog of cancer cells in

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, there are large libraries of cancer cells, presumably at
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I did a bit of reading last night (not much) to see how many
<br>
different *types* of cancers there actually are. 
<br>
<p>It was interesting. Tumors can be benign or malignant and only
<br>
the malignant are cancers.
<br>
<p>Malignant tumors (cancers) are classified in accordance with
<br>
the embryonic tissue of origin. Most (&gt;80%) are carcinomas,
<br>
from endothermal or ectothermal tissues such as skin or the lining
<br>
of internal organs and glands. Colon, breast, prostate and lung
<br>
cancers are carcinomas.
<br>
<p>Leukemias and lymphomas are cancers of the hematoietic cells
<br>
of the bone marrow and make up 9% in the US. Leukemias 
<br>
proliferate as single cells, lymphomas grow as masses.
<br>
<p>Finally sarcomas, ~1% are dervied from tissues such as bone,
<br>
fat and cartilage.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Anyone know what the technological bottleneck is on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; identifying markers of tumor cells (or even cells generally)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is basic biology.  Proteins that control cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; division generally operate only within the cell or within the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nucleus, not on the cell surface.  One doesn't need cell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surface proteins to mutate (usually) to cause excessive cell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; division. 
</em><br>
<p>Makes sense.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Sometimes one gets mutations for secreted proteins that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cause the cell to stimulate itself into dividing -- but then they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't attached to the surface of the cell.  The internal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteins are digested and are often displayed on cell surface,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but exactly which fragments get displayed (and these are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  small 9-12 amino acids) depends on which set of MHC
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes one has. 
</em><br>
<p>Yep.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the mutations responsible for cancer are not those that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one can display in the MHC proteins then it is very difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to detect cells that are in the process of becoming cancerous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and eliminate them.  In effect, it is true for many cancers
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  that the same reason one cannot develop a monoclonal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antibody is the same reason your immune system doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; eliminate the cancerous cells -- one cannot &quot;see&quot; what has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone wrong *inside* the cell.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Its going to take nanorobots to solve that problem.
</em><br>
<p>Yep. But there seems to be one positive thing at least. Given
<br>
nanobots, all malignant tumors, are likely to be directly abutting
<br>
the vasculature not two or three cells away from it so it should
<br>
not be necessary to pass through healthy cells to get at the
<br>
cancerous ones.  
<br>
<p>Tumorous cell two or three cell widths away from the
<br>
vasculature are likely to be benigh, ie, not dividing very fast
<br>
and ignorable. By the time the rate of division gets to be
<br>
a problem the nanobots will find a vasculature access point
<br>
to the cancer mass.
<br>
<p>A good early project for nanobots. Kicking cancers butt.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
