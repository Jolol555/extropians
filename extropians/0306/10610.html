<p>
Taking a major step forward, the Center for Responsible Nanotechnology (CRN)
<br>
has established a Board of Advisors, including several well-known names. The
<br>
first six members of CRN's Board of Advisors are José Luis Cordeiro, Eric
<br>
Drexler, Jerry Glenn, Lisa Hopper, Doug Mulhall, and Rosa Wang. More
<br>
advisors will be added in the near future, as CRN identifies and engages
<br>
leaders in government, business, and civil society who share a vision of
<br>
nanotechnology being widely used for productive and beneficial purposes,
<br>
with malicious uses limited by effective administration of the technology.
<br>
<p>&quot;We are proud to welcome such accomplished and respected figures to our
<br>
Board,&quot; says Mike Treder, Executive Director of CRN. &quot;It's a great
<br>
beginning. We aim to continue building a well-rounded Board, with additional
<br>
experts in fields beyond nanotechnology, such as economics, philosophy,
<br>
sociology, ecology, and politics. We're committed to a globally
<br>
representative mix, with members from all major world regions.&quot;
<br>
<p>José Luis Cordeiro is President of the Sociedad Mundial del Futuro
<br>
Venezuela, and author of The Great Taboo. An engineer and economist with
<br>
expertise in global affairs, he is Director of the Club of Rome (Venezuela),
<br>
and an international advisor to several companies and organizations. As
<br>
Director of the Association of Venezuelan Exporters (AVEX), he has
<br>
participated in the negotiations of the Free Trade Area of the Americas
<br>
(FTAA).
<br>
<p>K. Eric Drexler, Founder and Chairman of the Foresight Institute, is a
<br>
researcher concerned with emerging technologies and their consequences for
<br>
the future. In the mid 1980s, he introduced the term 'nanotechnology' to
<br>
describe atomically precise molecular manufacturing systems and their
<br>
products. His research ranges from computational modeling of molecular
<br>
machines to engineering analysis of molecular manufacturing systems and
<br>
their potential products. Author of Engines of Creation and Nanosystems, and
<br>
co-author of Unbounding the Future, he lectures widely on molecular
<br>
nanotechnology, its development, and its implications for the human future.
<br>
<p>Jerome C. Glenn is the Executive Director for the American Council for the
<br>
United Nations University, where he co-founded and directs the Millennium
<br>
Project on global futures research. He has 30 years experience in futures
<br>
research with governments, corporations, and international organizations
<br>
working for the Committee for the Future, Hudson Institute, Future Options
<br>
Room, Millennium Project, and as an independent consultant. He has written
<br>
over 90 articles and authored, edited, or co-authored eight books on the
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>Lisa Hopper is President and Founder of World Care, a non-profit
<br>
organization dedicated to raising consciousness in the education, health,
<br>
environmental, and community service arenas. World Care converts surplus
<br>
into valuable resources for relief efforts throughout the world, creating
<br>
opportunities for those who are less fortunate by providing the necessary
<br>
supplies.
<br>
<p>Douglas Mulhall, author of Our Molecular Future, is a leading figure in
<br>
global environmentalism. He has participated in designing, building, and
<br>
operating water recycling and flood control facilities in China and Brazil,
<br>
in cooperation with the European Commission and multinational companies. A
<br>
former Managing Director of the Hamburg Environmental Institute, he is
<br>
cofounder and director of O Instituto Ambiental, the first South American
<br>
institute to specialize in wastewater recycling.
<br>
<p>Rosa Wang is founder and principal of GeographicEngine.com, which offers
<br>
financial and strategic advisory to non-profits. In addition, she serves as
<br>
consultant for Ashoka Innovators for the Public, a non-profit organization
<br>
dedicated to the profession of social entrepreneurship. Rosa has extensive
<br>
experience in finance and economic policy based in North America and Asia,
<br>
and her past employers include Dresdner RCM Global Investors, Lehman
<br>
Brothers, and the Federal Reserve Bank of NY.
<br>
<p>Since its formation in late 2002, CRN has attracted significant notice for
<br>
taking a strong stance on the risks of unregulated molecular nanotechnology,
<br>
and the need for a coordinated international program of development. CRN's
<br>
founders, Executive Director Mike Treder and Director of Research Chris
<br>
Phoenix, believe that the humanitarian potential of nanotechnology is
<br>
enormous, but so also is the potential for misuse. Their mission is to raise
<br>
awareness of the issues presented by nanotechnology: the benefits and
<br>
dangers, and the possibilities for responsible use.
<br>
<p>The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology is headquartered in New York. CRN
<br>
is an affiliate of World Care, an international, non-profit, 501(c)(3)
<br>
organization. For more information on CRN, see www.CRNano.org.
