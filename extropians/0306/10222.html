<p>
I bought a bunch of Commodore stock in the mid'80's at
<br>
about $8/share.  In late '92, I believe it was, some
<br>
prominent analyst said that Commodore stock was the
<br>
hottest buy around, and the stock shot up to
<br>
$20/share, and, I think, maybe to $30 at peak.  From
<br>
there, a few months later, it had fallen to $3/share
<br>
and then the company went bankrupt.  
<br>
<p>I had plenty of insider knowledge as a journalist
<br>
covering Amiga products and related issues for several
<br>
Amiga magazines.  It was clear that the Amiga was
<br>
miles ahead of the competition in virtually every
<br>
respect, and about 10 million Amigas were ultimately
<br>
sold, so it certainly wasn't a market size problem,
<br>
and Amiga owners tended to be even more fanatically
<br>
loyal than Mac adicts.  From every technical
<br>
perspective, the Amiga was the horse to bet on.
<br>
<p>Except, the company was run by people who knew NOTHING
<br>
about computers or the computer market, and the CEO (a
<br>
banker) at one point expressed puzzlement over why
<br>
people would get so excited about a machine.  After
<br>
Commodore finally collapsed, various people from the
<br>
engineering dept. made retrospective comments about
<br>
how many times Commodore Mgt. had &quot;snatched defeat
<br>
from the jaws of victory.&quot;
<br>
<p>Commodore is the example that I know most intimately
<br>
and best, having spent a sizeable portion of 15 years
<br>
covering the Amiga, and 5 years prior as a VIC20/C64
<br>
user.  However, the same sort of analysis applies to a
<br>
host of other tech companies, including Apple, Atari,
<br>
AutoDesk, ....
<br>
<p>In each case, the bankers basically bought control and
<br>
then installed their people to run things - meaning
<br>
CEO's whose job it was to be the bankers' agents,
<br>
report back to them, and not rock the boat.  These
<br>
people were controllable in that they could not
<br>
possibly have achieved such a position on their
<br>
merits; i.e., it was their very incompetence and
<br>
consequent controllability (where else would they get
<br>
a job?) that were their desireable characteristics.  
<br>
<p>Terrified of making a mistake, but also terrified of
<br>
losing control, these flunkies predictably slotted
<br>
other incompetent jerks into positions to spy for them
<br>
and support their decisions, and those people did
<br>
likewise, leaving only engineering relatively
<br>
unscathed (only relatively, however, as when Commodore
<br>
put the same character who was responsible years
<br>
earlier for the C64 power supply that ALWAYS died in
<br>
charge of new products for the Amiga line, and he -
<br>
predictably - came up with the Amiga 600, which every
<br>
single reviewer noted immediately (and correctly)
<br>
would be a total failure, filling no concievable
<br>
market niche.
<br>
<p>Bottom line: whenever a market area - personal
<br>
computers, internet companies, biotech? - attracts the
<br>
attention of the banking/investment community, it is
<br>
the kiss of death.  They will finagle control away
<br>
from the dangerous innovators who made the company
<br>
profitable and then milk it all the way down, trading
<br>
their insider knowledge to their buddies to keep
<br>
making money even as the core value is diluted to
<br>
zero.  That's why I've been sticking mainly with
<br>
smaller companies still run by the original
<br>
management.
