<em>&gt; &gt; Why is it a crime in the USA to profit from information one has

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brain that others don't have in theirs? Isn't knowledge and insight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something we should reward? Where in the US Constitution is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated that
</em><br>

<em>&gt; what they
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brains? Who owns our brains, anyway?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>My take on this subject, stock values are very subjective and based alot on
<br>
what a person percieves a company to be worth at a time in the future.
<br>
Companies, can and in fact have been made or broken merely on their
<br>
percieved value, and not necessarily their real value.  If you are a
<br>
primarily stock driven company, then your company can *fail* merely because
<br>
more than a critical number of people *think* it will, regardless of
<br>
reality.  For this system of investing based on possible perceived future
<br>
value of something to work, the ability of individuals to manipulate future
<br>
perceived values must be curtailed.  In insider trading, ones knows that the
<br>
percieved value is not accurate, or that due to knowledge they know, or an
<br>
action of theirs they will take, the percieved value will deviate much
<br>
further from the actual value.  If the SEC did not curtail these activities,
<br>
it would make investing in stocks more risky than investing in shady
<br>
secretive governments.  Who knows if that they are telling you has any
<br>
modicum of truth?  Its the enforcement of these rules that allow this kind
<br>
of manipulative perception based investing to continue.  If the SEC did not
<br>
enforce these rules, the stock system would crumple.  Fine with me.  People
<br>
would have to then invest in companies with more objective criteria.
<br>
Studies I have heard of stock investing suggest it is little more than
<br>
gambling, even with extensive knowledge and research.  I believe this is in
<br>
part because the weight of percieved value holds sway over real value, which
<br>
is what a stock *should* represent.  Of course, I am no expert, and may be
<br>
completely wrong.  But I will not be investing in stocks anytime in the
<br>
future.
<br>
<p>regards,
<br>
