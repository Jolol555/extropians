<em>&gt; &gt; I see the debate as between those who agree with Harvey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is all a matter of semantics (and I am one of them),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and those who see it as much more significant, with an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; underlying, important factual issue about survival that must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be resolved.  It seems difficult to convincingly justify the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; intuition in either case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If all the questions are oriented around *action*, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either you will upload or you will not.  Either you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sacrifice yourself for your duplicate or you will not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The disagreements are substantive.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. We still live in a contingent world where financal
<br>
resources cannot be doubly allocated.
<br>
<p>As Damien puts it, and as we may imagine person generally
<br>
might ask themselves: 
<br>
<p>&quot;Would you spend $100,000 (or whatever it costs) to
<br>
bring about this discontinuous xoxing? It's like the choice 
<br>
of cryonics, but more moot. If you're dying anyway, you
<br>
can't take it with you, but wouldn't it be make you happier
<br>
to bequeath it to your kids, your extended family,&quot; etc
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think that people's minds are being changed.  
</em><br>
<p>I think we are at least refining the questions. And I think
<br>
there is substantial agreement that some terms like 
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; &quot;self&quot;, &quot;same person&quot; which normally are
<br>
used pretty freely are problematic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But I also claim that people's beliefs would (and perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will) alter dramatically after they've known a few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicates. 
</em><br>
<p>To go back to the leap of faith aspect. I have never seen
<br>
anything I regard as sentient return from the dead even in
<br>
convincing replica. A revived cryonaut would make the 
<br>
leap of faith in cryonics substantially less than leaps of faith
<br>
in religions. An uploaded personality, that can be interacted
<br>
with in a convincing Turing-like way would also give some
<br>
further evidence at least that the leap of faith is lessened. 
<br>
But note it does not remove it altogether because, imo, all
<br>
of experience each others personailies in reality only as 
<br>
streams of sensory data with which we interact.
<br>
<p>Again, on the practical, why we should bother with the
<br>
question at all aspect, for those who would like to see
<br>
cryonics and uploading become more mainstream a revived
<br>
animal, a &quot;Benny the dog&quot; (Vanilla Sky), is likely to give a
<br>
competitive edge against religions to people less sceptical
<br>
than me and influence social policy such as when 
<br>
(information losing) autopsies are done.
<br>
<p>The question I ask myself is what would make a difference
<br>
for me, from the standpoint of increasing my confidence that
<br>
I would *actually* survive cryonics, or uploading (that wasn't 
<br>
incremental - incremental being my scenario at present), and
<br>
as Lee points out teleportation.
<br>
<p>It seems taking a teleport would not suffice. I'd have
<br>
gone in reluctantly and come out happy to be alive but 
<br>
wondering if I was the same specimen that went in so 
<br>
reluctantly.
<br>
<p>Rather, I think the better way to approach it is to attack 
<br>
the question from the other way. To explore those scenarios
<br>
where to increasing degrees the &quot;mind&quot; as conscious, then 
<br>
unconscious process and brain are decoupled. If the mitochondria
<br>
in the neurons of the brain are still generating ATP then perhaps
<br>
EEG or no (my ignorance wall again) energy has continued to
<br>
play out on the substrate even in the clinically dead.
<br>
<p>Interestingly this seems to involve attacking the concept of self 
<br>
and may drawn one towards the conclusion that ones does not
<br>
know intellectually why the heck one has a urge to survive, or 
<br>
what exactly it is that one is trying to preserve.
<br>
<p>Some scattered thoughts.
<br>
<p>I assume.
<br>
<p>Two electrons may be functionally equivalent but they are not
<br>
the same. Equivalence is not identity. 
<br>
<p>Consciousness is emergent. It is not all or nothing, there are 
<br>
degrees of consciousness. In my experience it *always* arises
<br>
in the context of changing wetware. In my experience no brain
<br>
means no consciousness. 
<br>
<p>The notion of &quot;mind&quot;, the notion of &quot;self&quot;, seem to be a result
<br>
of a mental process that emerges like a program that through 
<br>
recursion becomes self aware but is always closely coupled 
<br>
with changes in the underlying substrate, with neural 
<br>
development.
<br>
<p>I am a combination of matter and energy. Historically the
<br>
matter has never been completely decoupled from the energy
<br>
flow. Cryonics and uploading would seem to completely 
<br>
decouple these. All atoms would be replaced (in cryonics)
<br>
producing functional equivalence but the new composite
<br>
would not be identical. Two functionally equivalent IBM
<br>
PCs do not have the same identity though they may be
<br>
functionally equivalent. Two versions of an operating system
<br>
on the PC's may be functionally equivalent, indeed one can 
<br>
download from the same disks, the same information onto
<br>
two functionally equivalent sets of hardware but what is
<br>
then running is not one unique program but two functionally
<br>
equivalent programs. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps the pre-conditions for consciousness, (or that illusion
<br>
that we mistakenly label 'consciousness' or 'self' as though it
<br>
was a discrete thing -perhaps its a measure of intensity) to
<br>
emerge can be ported, but not consciousness itself.
