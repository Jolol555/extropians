Ouch! You poor thing ...
<br>
<p>You might need a nail trephine. A hot paper clip or needle is used to
<br>
release blood which has collected under the nail - the pain relief is almost
<br>
instantaneous. You should also apply ice 10mins on/off for 30mins 3x day for
<br>
48hrs &amp; take some pain-killers. Keep the toe elevated.
<br>
<p>It is probably not fractured. There is not much you can do about it if it
<br>
is. You don't plaster a broken toe. It is immobilized by strapping to the
<br>
adjacent toes.
<br>
<p>I would have it checked out - just to see about the trephine, at least.
<br>
<p>All the best,
<br>
Patrick

<em>&gt; I dropped a very hard piece of laminate flooring on my toe and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think it is fractured above the joint.  My toe nail is black and blue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and my toe is very red and swollen.  It is extremely sensitive and I
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; just let it be and it will heal on its own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any and all suggestions are welcome.  (You can email me privately.)
</em><br>

### Strictly as a private person, not licensed to practice medicine outside
<br>
the state of Virginia, let me tell you: go to the doctor pronto. You could
<br>
have a partial fracture, or worse...
