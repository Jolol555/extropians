<p>Ahh, the &quot;follow the smart money&quot; theory. 
<br>
<p>Problem here is that science has never been able to prove the existence of
<br>
smart money in the market. See my last post to Rafal. The only real smart
<br>
money is the money invested in illegal insider trades. Neither intelligence
<br>
nor knowledge of public information buys one a superior return in the
<br>
market. However if you can *pretend* to be intelligent and knowledgeable
<br>
then you can be very successful as a broker or as a TV or radio stockmarket
<br>
guru. :)
<br>
<p>Reminds me... back in 1985 I appeared on a PBS television show called
<br>
&quot;Stockmarket Today.&quot; It was broadcast from a PBS station in the San Mateo Ca
<br>
area (the station was located at a college there somewhere, if I remember
<br>
correctly). At the time the Dow was only at about 1200, which by historical
<br>
standards was very high. I predicted on television that it would
<br>
nevertheless break the 2000 level within two years. People thought that was
<br>
a pretty bold prediction. But as you know the market took off and eventually
<br>
blew right through 10,000. 
<br>
<p>By the late 80's I was beginning to think I was a genius, until I started
<br>
applying my apparent genius to a more thorough and objective statistical
<br>
analysis of the market. 
<br>
<p>I learned through my own research that I was not a genius; that in reality I
<br>
was only some deluded stooge who happened to be at the right place at the
<br>
right time. I felt like that poor mentally retarded guy in &quot;Flowers for
<br>
Algernon&quot; who through some medical intervention becomes a genius, and then
<br>
through his genius realizes that he's destined to return to being retarded.
