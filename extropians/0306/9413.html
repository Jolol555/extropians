<em>&gt; I have an idea for one, but I'm dead-seriously not going to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post about it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the clear on this list. I suggest others consider this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carefully too. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'll codename this idea of mine Tarmac.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Care to suggest a secure channel? Sorry to be so coy, but that's what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; happens when I try to get serious about wearing a business 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guy hat. I had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to learn that. There's a time for going public, so to speak, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and this ain't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Spiders do crawl the Javein archive. :)

<em>&gt; I am not here to have an argument. I am here as part of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilization. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sometimes I forget.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not enough of a business guy to worry about that (although when bound to
<br>
secrecy, which is relatively common, I abide by my contracts).
<br>
<p>I have noticed that the ideas that *need* secrecy are limited in potential.
<br>
Once they are out of the box, first mover advantage can be strong enough, or
<br>
it can fail to work for various reasons, but the big boys catch up with you
<br>
eventually.
<br>
<p>OTOH, really truly good ideas seldom require secrecy, imo. The kinds of
<br>
ideas that people don't understand until the rubber of the finished product
<br>
hits the road and people say &quot;Oh, I get it now, damn, that *is* a good
<br>
idea&quot;. Like the photocopier, for example.
<br>
<p>I think that real ideas usually require skill and time and effort to
<br>
implement, and aren't hugely stealable - what you would be &quot;stealing&quot; is a
<br>
starting point, still requiring heaps of blood sweat &amp; tears (and
<br>
investment) before being able to prove itself.
<br>
<p>I also concur with Adrian that peer review is often worth more than secrecy.
<br>
I've worked for more than one small org that thought it had an amazing,
<br>
secret idea that it was working on for ages, that seemed clearly to me to be
<br>
really far less remarkable (and marketable) than the org thinks. Secrecy,
<br>
and the associated isolationism, can very easily lead you to empty your bank
<br>
account to no good end.
