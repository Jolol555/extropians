</em><br>
<p>### The disagreement between Alfio and John Clark prompted me to make the
<br>
following observation (or maybe just a restatement of the obvious):
<br>
difficulty accessing truthful information about products in the free market
<br>
is caused by the difficulty in making a profit on certain types of
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>Let's consider a manufacturer who has information about his product, which
<br>
if released to customers would put him at a disadvantage compared to other
<br>
manufacturers (e.g. a loss of 1000$ in sales). This loss is an
<br>
expression/summation of preferences of all the customers, therefore we can
<br>
assume than for N customers, the average customer will be willing to spend
<br>
somewhat less than 1000/N $ to know the truth about the product. If an
<br>
independent provider of information could produce and sell the product info
<br>
at a price 1000/N, such information would be provided. However, currently it
<br>
is not easy to prevent the free rider problem regarding information. In
<br>
practice, the purveyor of information would have to price his information
<br>
well below 1000/N. At some point, especially with expensive types of
<br>
consumer information, such as results of clinical drug trials, it would be
<br>
impossible to produce information profitably.
<br>
<p>This is the problem with the free market approach to consumer information -
<br>
the difficulty making a profit on a specific class of information - that
<br>
which is both expensive to replicate and harmful to manufacturer if
<br>
released. Information which is either cheap to replicate, or beneficial to
<br>
manufacturer will be either provided by information makers (Consumer
<br>
Reports, etc.) at a very low price, or gratuitously by the manufacturer.
<br>
<p>The statist solution to the problem is seemingly simple and effective -
<br>
manufacturers are forced to provide the information they already have
<br>
(nutrition labels), or if they do not have it, they are forced by law to
<br>
produce it (e.g. pharmaceutical companies) in order to be allowed to sell
<br>
products. However, this solution does have some problems: the feedback loops
<br>
between players in the game, manufacturer, customer, politician, and
<br>
bureaucrat, are very long, tenuous, so that information will be provided in
<br>
an inefficient, unstable way. Also, the opportunity for some players to
<br>
avoid consensus-building (as it happens every time a vote is not 100% for or
<br>
against a proposition), leads to dangerous restrictions of freedom in the
<br>
long run.
<br>
<p>The right (IMO) solution, use of transparency, trusted devices, and other
<br>
technical measures to improve the marketability of customer-desired
<br>
information, is frequently rejected by both libertarians and statists. The
<br>
former are worried about the Big Brother, the latter are uncomfortable with
<br>
too much freedom for both the manufacturer and the customer to choose who
<br>
will be harmed and how. The point for me is of course the long-term
<br>
maximization of material affluence of the average citizen (as a proxy
<br>
quantitative measure of the ability to indulge wishes, i.e. freedom). Such
<br>
an abstract measure of utility doesn't agree well with built-in emotional
<br>
reactions to the threat of physical violence (motivates some libertarians),
<br>
or a feeling of lack of control over the environment (drives the statist).
<br>
Ah, well, maybe this idea's time will come eventually.
<br>
<p>For the time being I am for mandatory nutrition labels if and only if the
<br>
information released has measurable survival-related value (e.g. content of
<br>
substances proven to be poisonous, such as trans-fatty acids), otherwise
<br>
voluntary labeling must do (as in the case of GMO, where the information
<br>
does not have relevance to individual survival). When somebody hides from me
<br>
information and thereby my life is endangered, in reciprocity I feel
<br>
justified in threatening his own life, if this is the only way of saving
<br>
mine.
