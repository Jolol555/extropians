<p><em>&gt;       Not at all.  Alfio.  In this society of English speaking people when

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It is evident that we think in a different manner. My view of &quot;religion&quot;
<br>
is not restricted to what I see around my immediate vicinity. Nor seems
<br>
Olga's, but I can't speak for her.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       In addition Olga, according to another poster, has included the leader
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of Israel as a &quot;religious nut&quot; when he is an atheist.  She has not included
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at least three atheists that have each murdered millions as examples of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;murderous people.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe because it was you that introduced the subject, and asked about
<br>
actual religious nuts?
<br>
<p><p>I've seen, and maybe partecipated, in many flame wars here. But I really
<br>
didn't expect religion-backed flames.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;       But to discover her greatest offense you have to listen to what she
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't say.  At no time has she recognized the distinction between philosophy
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;examines everything through the eyes of science and only science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Science is wonderful but it does not even attempt to answer the great
</em><br>
<em>&gt;questions of life.  That is what philosophy and great art attempts to do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;[...]
</em><br>
<p>It's so off-topic that I don't know what do reply. Please realize that you
<br>
are following a line of reasoning that no one is thinking about. Like
<br>
going from a comment about an hypotetical nut straight to Hitler. It's an
<br>
off-track route that, I'm sure, no one had in mind.
<br>
<p>Ciao,
