<br>
entirely pointless to me. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes Naddy, that would be pretty pointless to shoot a dumb round at a 
<br>
target 70 to 400 miles away.  That is the range we are currently thinking 
<br>
about.  Apparently we have achieved a 70 miles range in development tests and have 
<br>
a 400 mile randge in the early planning stage.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is an area we call the littoral (n.) lying at or alongside the 
<br>
shoreline.  Our Marine Corp and Army is interested in having our Navy extend 
<br>
that zone as far inland as possible with its fire support.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is why we are in interested in the extremely long range weapons.  
<br>
The various services want to fix the location of a target using the GPS (?) 
<br>
system, call in the location and have the Navy fire using a guided round aimed 
<br>
at the given GPS location.  As I understand the system the bullet would steer 
<br>
itself to the desired location.  In addition such a system would reduce the 
<br>
need for the land forces to provide themselves heavy artillery.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BTW guys, I took several ideas that we have been booting around for 
<br>
the past few days to my cousin for his comments.  Believe me, unlike me, my 
<br>
cousin is an engineer's engineer and this is his general field.  His comment was, 
<br>
&quot;Maybe in my lifetime.&quot;  However as he and I are starting to get elderly I am 
<br>
still not sure what timespan he had in mind. &lt;G&gt;
