Kevin Freels stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;In the future, people in this country are going to be faced with a choice. To become educated, or to starve. Hopefully, the majority of people choose the former. The argument that cheap labor overseas is going to kill our economy is just garbage. People can move into the country, or jobs can move out. It doesn;t matter. Eventually, economic expansion will improve the lives of everyone. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The educated are the ones taking it up the ass, nowadays, not the blue collar folks. Or don't you consider developers, and network admins educated? These are the folks whose jobs have been and are being off-shored. You stated that people can move into the country. Should Americans move into Brazil or India to follow these jobs? You said eventually the economic expansion will improves the lives of everyone.  Is this before or after the US economy is debstablized? Companies which used to make products and sell services are now prone to merely squeeze costs and off-shore jobs, merely to deceive their stockhholders, into thinking that saved costs is the same as growth .
