<em>&gt; I'm not blasé, I know it's a terrible problem but I also know that making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nice to Islam will not reduce their anger one iota because the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; root cause of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that anger was not any specific action committed by the west.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They are angry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at us for what we are not what we did. They would be less angry if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foundation of the west was some dogma, even some dogma they didn't like,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead it is based on free markets and pragmatic problem solving and that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; frightens and angers them. They would be less angry if our system didn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work very well but we're rich free and powerful and they are poor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppressed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and weak. 800 years ago Islam was the most advanced civilization on Earth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but its been straight downhill since, today they are not even second or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; third but dead last; we have the word of The Profit so it can't be our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fault, it must be due to those evil westerners, our only mistake was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; embracing too many 16'th century ideas, we should go back to 13'th century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideas.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>To emphasize your point
<br>
<p>Oslo: Why Us?
<br>
<p>&quot;Norwiegians are trying to figure out what they did to earn the enmity of al
<br>
Qaida.  In an audio tape aired on Al-Jazeera last week, the terror network's
<br>
No. 2 man, Ayman al-Zawahiri, called on followers to &quot;hit the embassies of
<br>
America, England, Australia, and Norway, their interests, their companies,
<br>
and their employees; set the ground ablaze under their feet.&quot; While the
<br>
first three countries took active roles in the conflict in Iraq, Norway did
<br>
not.  Known for its global peace-making efforts, the country is home to the
<br>
Nobel Peace Prize.  &quot;Why Norway?&quot; wailed a headling in the Oslo daily
<br>
Verdens Gang.  &quot;We are very surprised,&quot; said a Foreign Ministry spoksman.
<br>
&quot;I have no idea why we were named&quot; &quot;
