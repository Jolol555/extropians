When I read that a nuclear terrorist attack is inevitable, I experience a
<br>
sense of deja-vous. (did I spell  that correctly?)
<br>
I don't know the ages of the people on this list, but I would assume that
<br>
most of us are old enough to remember the cold-war and the pessimistic
<br>
beliefs that we would all die in a nuclear holocaust.
<br>
I will grant that the proliferation of nuclear weapons and the increased
<br>
technologies needed to produce them makes it very likely that it will
<br>
happen, but a terrorist organization that can get their hands on a nuke,
<br>
smuggle it into the country and detonate isn't exactly stupid.
<br>
They are aware that there is no possible way they could wage a full-scale
<br>
war and win on their own.
<br>
One concern I have is that MAD doesn't apply when the enemy is willing to
<br>
die. But I don't think that the leaders of these organizations are willing
<br>
to die for their causes. Theysee themselves as too important. They know our
<br>
capabilities, especially now. They may be able to get one or two nukes in,
<br>
but we could make the entire middle East a radioactive waste land!
<br>
They also know that there would be almost no support for such an attack and
<br>
the entire world would go after them in response to an attack that would
<br>
hurt, but would not be mortal to us.
<br>
So we come back to the cold war. The cost of a nuclear attack is higher than
<br>
the benefit. For this reason, we may never see such an attack. In the
<br>
future, people may once again look back and wonder how we got through this
<br>
period in our history without such an attack.

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; What impact., on this list, would such an attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; have, if it were devastating, in the number of casualties?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Would such an attack, change anyon's mind on public policy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that have been so ellucidated on this list, over the last 2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; months?  Would anyone here embrace the W as a result, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; curse him for not being vigilant against such an attack?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A better question is how we feel about current US policies in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; context of future terrorist activities.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Personally, I fully expect a nuclear (not just radiological)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attack against the US in the coming 10 - 20 years.  I believe current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US foreign policy makes this event more likely rather than less.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I'm already aghast at Bush.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm aghast that you're aghast. Of course, many groups around the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are dismayed at Bush's &quot;we're not your punching bag anymore&quot; attitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is to be expected when so many groups have learned from past
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administrations that terrorism and extortion pays and that the US, esp
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US left, is quite willing to be a punching bag for being the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-eminent 'imperialist dog' exploiting the masses of the second,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; third, and fourth worlds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While many on the left would like to adopt the French attitude (and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not surprising that the biggest America haters here in the US are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also francophiles) that it is our fault for our imperialist attitudes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is being ignored is that the Islamist agenda implicitly accepts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Islam must adopt the same imperialist agenda that their ancestors
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the Andalusian era took for granted. Are the anti-imperialists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against America similarly against muslim imperialistic aspirations?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I fully expect the terrorists to use nukes within a decade, and I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fully expect to see the left blaming America for its own policies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, the day they use a nuke, I think we'll see a significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change in the muslim street attitudes toward the terrorist groups. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only thing that would prevent terrorists from nuking would be if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were smart enough to realize that it would lead to their total undoing.
