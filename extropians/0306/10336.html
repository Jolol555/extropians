Things in Iran look to be hotting up, with pro-reform students saying 
<br>
they'll demonstrate until early July.  That, plus the trouble being stirred 
<br>
up by Islamist &quot;vigilantes&quot; and the pressure being put on by the EU/U.S. 
<br>
looks like potentially pushing Iran to greater internal unrest.

<em>&gt;Iran protests at US 'interference'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Iran has made a strong protest over what it calls American &quot;interference&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in its internal affairs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Thirty &quot;miscreants and hooligans&quot; are being held by police, after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thousands took to the streets in a sixth night of demonstrations on Sunday.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A police commander quoted by the official Irna news agency did not say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;whether those detained were anti-regime protesters, or hardline Islamic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vigilantes opposing them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;On Sunday an influential group of Iranian dissidents issued an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unprecedented declaration defending the right to criticise their leaders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;As well as criticising the conservative clerics, demonstrators have also 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;attacked the reformist President, Mohammad Khatami, who is accused of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;betraying hopes for change.
</em><br>

<br>
<em>&gt;Iran rejects tougher nuclear checks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Iran has confirmed that it will not sign up to tougher, short-notice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;inspections of suspected nuclear sites.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The European Union joined growing international pressure on Iran on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Monday, saying Tehran should comply with the measures &quot;urgently and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unconditionally&quot;.
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2992240.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2992240.stm</a>
<br>
<em>&gt;Iran dissidents raise their voices
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;An influential group of Iranian dissidents have issued an unprecedented 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;declaration defending the right to criticise their leaders.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Following five nights of violent protests around Tehran University, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;248 reformists said the people of Iran had &quot;the right to fully supervise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the action of their rulers&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;Sitting or making individuals sit in the position of divine and absolute 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power is a clear heresy towards God and a clear affront to human dignity,&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;said the strongly-worded statement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;US President George W Bush has meanwhile described the Iranian protests as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;positive&quot; and &quot;the beginning of people expressing themselves toward a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;free Iran&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Both conservative and pro-reform members of the Iranian establishment have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strongly condemned US support for the demonstrations, which are now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reported to have spread beyond Tehran.
</em><br>
<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2989778.stm">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2989778.stm</a>
<br>
<em>&gt;Iranian protesters remain resolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Crowds of students in the Iranian capital Tehran have staged nights of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;protests to express anger about the slow pace of reform in the country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The rare show of defiance against the power of Iranian supreme leader 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been harshly suppressed by conservative 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vigilantes and the Iranian authorities.
</em><br>

<br>
<p>Worth keeping an eye on developments.
