<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm rambling, sorry. Anyone have anything definitive to add to this?
</em><br>
<p><p>Yeah.  My idea of altered immigration reciprocity could provide solutions to 
<br>
many problems both for Americans who have been globalized or outsourced or 
<br>
immgration-ized out of a job (Globalization-Screwed Americans (GSA's) 
<br>
hereinafter), and provide solution for Third World Country (TWC, hereinafter) 
<br>
citizens who see immigration as a way from them to make a life for themselves 
<br>
either by immigrating, or by getting remittance money from a relative who 
<br>
immigrate to America (Third-World Strivers (TWS's) hereinafter). 
<br>
<p>The fact is that America is being exploited by corporations and investors who 
<br>
seek to raise profits by outsourcing labor for work related to America, or to 
<br>
lowering wages by encouraging immigration both legal and illegal.
<br>
<p>This is not the way it should be. By definition, only a small part of the 
<br>
American populace can make a living through investing, seeing as how 
<br>
quantities of money are relative.  America should be exploited by the average 
<br>
non-investing citizen.  THey could exploit America by withholding for 
<br>
themselves the exclusive right to work in America, save for would be 
<br>
immigrants from countries where jobs would be available for Americans, e.g., 
<br>
European countries.
<br>
<p>Immigration reciprocity is a new idea.  It proposes that a country may send 
<br>
immigrants to America only to the degree that Americans could immigrate 
<br>
there. This idea is put forth by anti-mass immigration enthusiasts. THey 
<br>
claim that it allows American pols a chance to avoid cries of racism when 
<br>
clamping down on immigration.  
<br>
<p>I doubt many of you are aware of this, but it is very hard for Americans to 
<br>
immigrate (or live for extended periods of time) in Third World COuntries 
<br>
(TWCs). For example, you cannot move to India unless you are of Indian 
<br>
heritage.
<br>
<p>After all, fair is fair. How fair is it that many thousands of Indians can 
<br>
move to the USA and make a living while I cannot move to India and make a 
<br>
living?
<br>
<p>However, why not take immigration reciprocity a step further? 
<br>
<p>Though there are not any jobs available for the **average** Americans in 
<br>
Third World Countries TWC, hereinafter) (to any significant degree (do I 
<br>
really have to say that? Oh, that's right. THis is the Internet)), there is 
<br>
investment opportunity for **average Americans** in TWCs.  $20K would go a 
<br>
long way in starting a business in a TWC. And I disagree with the poster who 
<br>
earlier said that lack of capital is NOT a problem for the average citizen of 
<br>
a TWC. That is a BIG problem. 20K dollars is very hard to come by there. And 
<br>
20K gives you a lot of power in a TWC.  20K in my bank account here makes me 
<br>
no big deal. But 20K in India puts me in an elite group.
<br>
<p>Now, as someone else pointed out, and to which I elaborated, most TWCs are 
<br>
strangled by a parasitic bureaucracy.  This **could** be a problem for 
<br>
Americans who wanted to seize upon the opportunity to start a business in a 
<br>
TWC.  
<br>
<p>But one major problem is that in order to go and live in a TWC and operate a 
<br>
business, you have to have a LOT of money. For example, the threshold for 
<br>
Mexico is something like $250K.  OTherwise, you cannot live there and operate 
<br>
a business. Other countries have other restrictions. For example, in the 
<br>
Philippines, a foreigner cannot own &gt; 50% of a business.
<br>
<p>It is currently very hard for Americans to go to a TWC and start a business.
<br>
I think this is because American politicians only seek access to TWCs for 
<br>
large corporations, and not for average Americans. THis is wrong.
<br>
<p>But some very basic dynamics have been left out of consideration: the TWS's, 
<br>
who number in the billions. The TWSs and the GSAs could be the carrot and 
<br>
stick that reform the TWC countries.  If the USA negotiates with the TWCs to 
<br>
allow immigration access (and trade access) only if Americans can go into the 
<br>
TWC and start a business with a few thousand dollars, unhamper by stifling 
<br>
bureaucracy. 
<br>
<p>Immigration and trade access would be predicated on the degree to which 
<br>
AMericans would be able to actually do that. If Americans complain about 
<br>
being hassled by bureaucracy, then the immigration access would be cut off. 
<br>
And the TWSs would hopefully see their dreams being lost and take it out on 
<br>
the TWC leaders.
<br>
<p>Obviously, the TWCs could use the infusion of dollars and know how from 
<br>
average Americans who have $10-20K and want to own a business in a TWC. And 
<br>
the GSA could have a lot of opportunity available for them.
<br>
<p>Just an idea that could help GSAs and TWSs.
