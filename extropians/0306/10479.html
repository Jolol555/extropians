</em><br>
<p>But this is a basic choice inherently tied up with the choice to seek
<br>
truth.  You cannot take failure on that choice as assumed, then ask
<br>
whether it is rational to be rational (note recursion).  And why the 
<br>
counterfactual?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The vast majority of humanity believes they are in this situation.
</em><br>
<p>What of it?  If all our beliefs were correct, what need would there be to 
<br>
guard against unknown unknowns by being rational?  As it happens the 
<br>
belief is wrong, and isn't that the point?  What need would there be to be 
<br>
rational &quot;if&quot; all truth were contained in the Bible, as many people believe?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this situation, I claim the extra effort to substantially overcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our inherited biases and be more rational than we naturally would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems usually more effort that it is worth, given the goals specified.
</em><br>
<p>But why should this imaginary scenario matter?  Was there ever a point in 
<br>
human history where the academic grounding of rationality was strong 
<br>
enough to describe evolutionary motives for self-deception and contrast 
<br>
them with Bayesian reasoning, while the Singularity was yet far off?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evolution has in fact equipped humans with behavioral strategies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughly appropriate to such situations.  I do grant that in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation you think you are in, where your goals and the future you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; face are very different from what evolution has equipped you to deal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with, being unnaturally rational may well be a better strategy.  So, do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we disagree or not?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure.  What is the utility of thought experiments in which 
<br>
humanity develops sophisticated evolutionary psychology a century in 
<br>
advance of the Singularity?
