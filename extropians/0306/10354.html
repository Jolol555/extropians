<em>&gt; I edited out more of the discussion above because it all comes down to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one simple point.  Yes, truth is instrumentally useful in various ways, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but unless you assign it overwhelming primary importance, it is easy to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find situations where you should be willing to give up the instrumental 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advantages of truth to obtain other things.  Such as in marriage, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; promoting group loyalty, and much else.  Can't you imagine any such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations?
</em><br>
<p>Even if you assign truth overwhelming primary importance, an altruist can 
<br>
as easily be confronted with the dilemna, i.e., &quot;If you don't believe that 
<br>
2 + 2 = 5 in the next ten seconds, I'm going to implant that false belief 
<br>
into ten other people.  Is your knowledge of the truth more valuable than 
<br>
theirs?&quot;  Fortunately, my brain is wired in such a way that I would fail 
<br>
to believe this even if I tried.
<br>
<p>Calling the truth &quot;instrumentally useful&quot; vastly understates the point. 
<br>
The truth is an &quot;ethical heuristic&quot;, in the CFAI sense.  In any given 
<br>
situation where it *seems* that there is some &quot;good&quot; reason for believing 
<br>
a lie, it is more likely that the reason itself is wrong.  The truth is 
<br>
valuable for reasons which are not always immediately obvious.  You and I 
<br>
both know that a less-informed or less-intelligent truthseeker would *in 
<br>
fact* be far safer trying simply to find the truth, always, rather than 
<br>
trying to recalculate in any given instance whether knowing the truth is 
<br>
the best strategy.  Despite all conceptually possible thought experiments, 
<br>
in practice, in real life, the truth is so important that the net expected 
<br>
utility of asking the question &quot;Should I believe what is true?&quot; is 
<br>
negative.  You are more likely to make a mistake than you are to run 
<br>
across (and successfully identify!) a situation where wholeheartedly 
<br>
pursuing the truth is somehow not the best strategy.
<br>
<p>Reality is all one piece, and the explanation of reality is all one piece. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;To defend a lie requires embracing other lies, and you cannot know the 
<br>
cost of those lies in advance, because you have destroyed the very means 
<br>
by which you would accurately calculate the true cost.  To abandon the 
<br>
truth is far more dangerous than it looks, for reasons which are not 
<br>
immediately obvious, and which apply in a way that approximates full 
<br>
generality.  That is, to calculate the supposed utility of self-deception 
<br>
in any specific instance is extremely demanding of both computing power 
<br>
and knowledge, has a very high prior answer of yielding a negative answer, 
<br>
has a higher chance of yielding false positives than false negatives, has 
<br>
a higher penalty for false positives than false negatives, and requires 
<br>
already knowing the truth about the matter for which one is attempting to 
<br>
calculate the utility of self-deception.
<br>
<p>It's one thing to admit the philosophical possibility that there are 
<br>
hypothetical scenarios where the &quot;right&quot; thing to do is believe falsely, 
<br>
just as it is possible to construct thought experiments where the right 
<br>
thing to do is commit suicide or overwrite your own goal system.  I would 
<br>
not, however, advise people to try and calculate the utility of truth in 
<br>
specific instances; we are not that smart.  We are especially not that 
<br>
smart in a situation where sticking to the truth seems emotionally hard. 
<br>
The safe rule is to Just Be Rational; to arrive at that conclusion once, 
<br>
for the general case, and not reconsider it, especially in moments of 
<br>
emotional stress.  The rule &quot;Just Be Rational&quot; is more reliable than you 
<br>
are.  Sticking to the truth is a very simple procedure, and it is more 
<br>
reliable than any amount of complex verbal philosophization that tries to 
<br>
calculate the utility of truth in some specific instance.
