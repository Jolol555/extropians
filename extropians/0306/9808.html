University Health Network researchers discover new class of human
<br>
stem cells

<p>&quot;Cells show promise for cancer and transplant patients because of 
<br>
rapid growth in bone marrow (Toronto, June 9, 2003) - Scientists
<br>
with University Health Network have discovered a new class of 
<br>
human stem cells that rapidly grow when implanted in the bone 
<br>
marrow of mice. The findings, available today in an advance on-line
<br>
publication of the international scientific journal Nature Medicine,
<br>
are a major advancement in human stem cell research with possible
<br>
significant clinical implications for designing more effective cancer
<br>
therapies.
<br>
<p>&quot;This is an exciting discovery because for the first time we have
<br>
found human stem cells that rapidly rebuild a blood system,&quot; said 
<br>
Dr. John Dick, lead author of the study, senior scientist with UHN,
<br>
and a professor in the University of Toronto's Department of Molecular
<br>
and Medical Genetics. &quot;The potential is that it may allow transplant
<br>
patients to quickly regain their blood cells, which are critical to their
<br>
immune system.&quot;
<br>
<pre>
----
By injecting the stem cells (these would be adult hematopoietic cells
- the patient's own cells - so no compatibility problems) into the bone 
marrow directly, rather than the bloodstream, it seems that the 
immune system (which is constructed from such cells) can rebuild
itself in about half the time. This translated into humans might 
reduce the window of risk of  infection following some cancer 
treatment where immunity was knocked out by chemo or radiation
therapy.
