<p>
In the book The Golden Age, the truth-detection was done by the
<br>
Sophotechs, the super-AIs millions of times smarter than people.
<br>
These AIs were also trustworthy (&quot;friendly&quot;?), so if they learned
<br>
someone's secrets it was OK.  It was a sort of literal deus ex machina
<br>
solution to the problem.
<br>
<p>But if the people doing the mind-reading are of only equal complexity and
<br>
intelligence to the minds being read, then it seems like it would be much
<br>
more difficult to untangle the truth about what someone's true beliefs
<br>
and motivations are.  It's not even clear that a human level intelligence
<br>
could understand the brain of a human being in sufficient detail.
<br>
<p>As far as the issue of keeping secrets that Wei raised, there might be a
<br>
few possible solutions.  One would be to create an AI which would read
<br>
your mind, report on your truthfulness, and then self-destruct.  Or,
<br>
given such an AI program, in principle you could use a crypto algorithm,
<br>
a zero knowledge proof, to show that your brain state would satisfy the
<br>
AI program, without actually running it.
<br>
<p>Another possibility would be to standardize on mental architectures which
<br>
have a fairly strict separation between the motivational structure and
<br>
certain kinds of factual knowledge.  Then you could expose the one part
<br>
but keep the other secret, and the mind reader could be confident that
<br>
the secret data would not have a significant impact.  However I'm not
<br>
sure it makes sense to keep secrets but somehow to have them be unable
<br>
to affect your motivations.
<br>
<p>As a final point, the question was raised about how to allocate resources
<br>
for problem solving: how much to spend working on the problem, versus
<br>
looking for other methods to solve it.  Apparently the answer to this
<br>
is known, at least in principle.  Juergen Schmidhuber, best known for
<br>
his idea that the multiverse consists of all possible computer programs
<br>
being run at once, has a page describing Levin Search, an algorithm that
<br>
goes back to 1973:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/optimalsearch.html">http://www.idsia.ch/~juergen/optimalsearch.html</a>
<br>
<p>Schmidhuber's team has improved and extended the algorithm.  Basically
<br>
the computer spends half its time working on the problem using the best
<br>
algorithm it has found so far, and the other half of the time trying to
<br>
find new algorithms for the problem.  This also includes time to try to
<br>
improve the algorithm-search technique.  Apparently in the long run this
<br>
works as fast as if you knew the very best algorithm from the beginning,
<br>
to within a small constant factor.
<br>
<p>So that's it, that's the best algorithm for living in the world, I guess.
<br>
