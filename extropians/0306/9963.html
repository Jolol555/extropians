</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I should make clear that this thread is far from the only one where these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kinds of tactics are being used.  In fact, I see the quality of almost all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our political discussions as being atrocious, full of name-calling and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rhetorical trickery.  Complaining about all of them would be a full time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; job, which I am not willing to take on.
</em><br>
<p>I have started pointing out a few of these as examples.  My point is just to
<br>
prove that it really is occurring.  I likewise don't have enough time to
<br>
take on all of these or act as our moderator.  However, I am not sure what
<br>
to do about it.  Something needs to change.  There is no reason why we can't
<br>
accuse each other of crimes against humanity, treason and make other
<br>
horrible claims in a calm, civilized manner without resorting to rhetorical
<br>
trickery.
<br>
<p>I see this problem as a direct cause of my previous complaint that we aren't
<br>
attracting more scientists and mainstream support.  I don't think real
<br>
science and the mainstream public have a stomach to put up with this sort of
<br>
nonsense.  If we want to deliver a message, we need to do it honestly and
<br>
fairly without resorting to irrational tactics.  I believe that only this
<br>
will make our list acceptable to real scientists, rational thinkers and
<br>
logical debaters.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On this list we claim to be willing to explore novel technologies.  Yet we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engage in exactly the same styles of pointless rhetorical battling that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can find in any other forum on the net.  What is Extropian about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we handle political disagreements?  Nothing.  We just yell at each other.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  We all need to grow up, transcend, and really act in an extropian
<br>
manner....
<br>
But how?
