Ron, I have no idea what you're talking about in terms of a &quot;clique&quot;,
<br>
but let me make the status of the list clear.  This list belongs to
<br>
Extropy Institute, which is ultimately governed by its board of
<br>
directors and which is run on a a day-to-day basis by its executive,
<br>
which is its president, Natasha Vita-More, assisted where possible by me
<br>
as ExI's vice-president.  Most of the old-timers on this list know us
<br>
personally to one degree or another, and I think we have the support of
<br>
those who have been part of this community for a long time.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Natasha has acted to appoint Hal Finney as interim list moderator, a
<br>
decision I support 100% -- Hal's been around as a part of this community
<br>
for a long, long time and is respected as a reasonable, fair and
<br>
intelligent person.  I know I've enjoyed corresponding with him through
<br>
this medium for going on a decade, and have learned a thing or two from
<br>
him!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Let's give Hal our support, renew our commitment to reasonable and
<br>
polite dialogue and focus on the values we share: progress and
<br>
improvement in the human condition.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Greg Burch
<br>
Vice-President, Extropy Institute

<p><p><p>In a message dated 6/19/2003 12:45:01 AM Central Standard Time,
<br>
<a href="mailto:paatschb@optusnet.com.au?Subject=RE:%20Offlist%20%20%20Re:%20List%20Moderator%20Suggestions">paatschb@optusnet.com.au</a> writes: Yourself ;-), Hal, Harvey, Eliezer (has
<br>
experience), Greg, Steve Davies, all good candidates.  There might be a
<br>
number of others that might be sufficiently invested in the health of
<br>
the list and concerned to do the job well to grow into a job they may
<br>
not have a natural flair for.  Say Lee Corbin? and perhaps me, but the
<br>
workload scares me and its no fun doing any sort of policing work or
<br>
umpiring.  If you really wanted to experiment will what a bit of
<br>
responsibility might do how about Ron, Mike and Sam ;-)
<br>
<p>Brett,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A theory has been going around this list that the list is
<br>
operated by a clique.  To this date I have resisted the theory and
<br>
denied its validity.  I did this partially just because I didn't want to
<br>
believe its truth.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My personal belief was that a majority that closely shared the
<br>
same political convictions was warring with anyone that attempted to
<br>
maintain any position to the contrary.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction I was making was the one made by Gatto.  Gatto
<br>
states that a conspiracy is not necessary when a group with the same
<br>
bias exists.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can live with a Gatto type situation but you have gone a long
<br>
way to convince me I was wrong.  If your suggestions were carried out I
<br>
would be convinced that a politically biased group was formally in
<br>
charge of the Extropian list.  Of course this would no longer be an
<br>
Extropian group should that come to pass.
<br>
Ron h.
