<em>&gt; you will find that the leaders, Egypt especially, are trying 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desperately to hold the lid on before they are either chased 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of country or left swinging from a lamp pole.
</em><br>
<p>Most of the dictators who rule the arab countries are indeed
<br>
frightened of democracy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      Yet the best advice MEZ can give us is not to send so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many bombs and missiles.  
</em><br>
<p>I have made, in this thread and others, concrete proposals.
<br>
Specifically: 
<br>
<p>1) That the US should refuse to support dictatorial regimes (Saudi
<br>
Arabia, Egypt, etc..) unless those regimes are taking concrete and
<br>
measurable steps towards democracy, open market, civil liberties, a
<br>
free press, the rule of law, and so on.
<br>
<p>2) That the US should dramatically increase its foreign aid to the
<br>
region (and to much of the rest of the world) and focus that aid on
<br>
incentives for nations to implement the political and economic reforms
<br>
I list above.  
<br>
<p>US foreign aid spending is currently about 1/20th of US military and
<br>
security spending.  A rational foreign policy would balance out the
<br>
carrot and the stick a bit more.
<br>
<p>3) That the US reserve the use of military force as a last resort.
<br>
Indeed, I believe Iraq was a particularly heinous situation.  And with
<br>
a US administration who I trusted to implement a long-range foreign
<br>
policy that made sense, I could have been convinced to support
<br>
military action.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt;      At first MEZ gave his advice because he was a middle 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; easterner and therefore held special expertise.  Now he is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poor Egyptian Christian that hasn't been in the country since 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he was 3 years old.  At first he lambasted the US and its 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; policies, now he is a loyal American and I mustn't criticize 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him.  
</em><br>
<p>Your post sheds much heat but little light.  As I posted in a previous
<br>
conversation with you a few months ago, I'm an atheist.  I was born to
<br>
parents of a christian minority in Egypt.  I moved to the US at age 3
<br>
and am culturally american (or as culturally american as an atheist
<br>
transhumanist can be).  Living here has not prevented me from
<br>
traveling the world, and in particular from visiting the place I was
<br>
born or conversing with people who live in that region.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only one thing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is consistant with him, everything he says is detrimental to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our country, IMHO. 
</em><br>
<p>Demonizing those who you disagree with is so convenient, isn't it?
<br>
Yet it does nothing to address the issues.  I've posted my analysis of
<br>
the situation, the evidence which supports that analysis, and the
<br>
proposals for future action that arise from it.  All you've posted
<br>
here are insults, distortions of the views of others, and vague
<br>
opinions which you have yet to back up.
