Harvey said:
<br>
&lt;&lt;This sounds less extreme, but the logic error is still there.  You cannot
<br>
assume anything about anyone based on a lack of information from them.
<br>
There could be a million reasons why someone doesn't respond.  This tactic
<br>
can never add information to a debate, while it can frequently lead to
<br>
misunderstandings and accusations of misrepresentation.  I maintain that
<br>
this source of information is unsupportable and should not be used in a
<br>
rational debate where the person in question is available for comment if
<br>
they so choose.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Harvey, when the anti-war protestors, actors, comics line up against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Son of George, and have never, ever, been heard saying a word against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam, or the Saudis, or Bin Ladin, what is a thoughtful person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supposed to think?
</em><br>
<p>That they oppose the &quot;Son of George&quot;, but that you've never heard them speak
<br>
out about Saudis or Bin Ladin.  Seriously, I don't know what else you could
<br>
think.  These are not the same topic.  It is possible to speak on one and
<br>
not the other.  Do you really believe that everybody who opposes George Bush
<br>
must support bin Laden without a specific disclaimer otherwise?  This is
<br>
insane.
<br>
<p>Maybe they're interested in American politics but not our foreign policy.
<br>
Maybe they want to modify their leadership's actions, but don't feel they
<br>
can have much influence on foreign terrorists.  Maybe they think that George
<br>
is more sensitive to public opinion than foreign terrorists.  Or, for the
<br>
comedians, maybe they think George is funny, but they don't see anything
<br>
funny about terrorism.  Maybe so many people support George that they feel
<br>
like they have to fight for their cause, but there isn't a lot of
<br>
pro-bin-Laden support in this country so they don't have to fight that
<br>
battle.  Maybe they think there are non-obvious reasons to oppose George
<br>
that they need to explain it a lot, but the reasons for opposing bin-Laden
<br>
are so obvious that they don't need to be explained.  Maybe because people
<br>
debate and disagree about George, but there is not so much debate or
<br>
disagreement about bin Laden.
<br>
<p>There are so many reasons, I would never have jumped to the conclusion you
<br>
draw.
<br>
<p>On a personal note:  You probably think I am anti-George because of my
<br>
frequent liberal-leaning rants.  I am not sure that I have ever felt the
<br>
need to oppose bin-Laden in this group.  It never seemed to come up or be
<br>
disputed among us.  Do you therefore believe I am a bin-Laden supporter?
<br>
Isn't that what your logic demands?  Is that really what you think?  Do you
<br>
really think that conclusion is accurate and supportable based on evidence?
<br>
I really am not following your logic here.
