<p>The news as I heard it is that she was indicted for five counts of
<br>
securities fraud in addition to conspiracy and making false statements in
<br>
the investigation. 
<br>
<p>She claims to have had a stop-loss order in with her broker to sell if
<br>
ImClone fell below 60, but the books show that her broker entered the stop
<br>
loss in a different ink, suggesting that the books were doctored after the
<br>
fact. 
<br>
<p>I don't think Stewart or her broker are without guilt here. However I do not
<br>
approve of the laws that made it a crime for her to protect her interests
<br>
when she happened to learn that
<br>
her investment in ImClone was likely to go sour. In that respect she was
<br>
acting naturally and rationally.
