And there are people who win at poker too.  But what makes you think you are 
<br>
another   Buffet?
<br>
<p>Robin,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me compliment you on asking a good question.  Your question is 
<br>
absolutely a real world question for me as I am working to position myself to try 
<br>
exactly that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe the question goes this way.  I have several elders that played 
<br>
poker for money.  No I don't just mean they gambled I mean they played as semi 
<br>
pros and they went home with the other fellows money.  I noticed they never 
<br>
played each other except rarely and just for fun.  They were looking for suckers 
<br>
to fleece not sharks to compete with.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition I have read Mr. Buffet, and observed my grandfather as 
<br>
well as an old buddy playing business for money.  Mr. Buffet is in stocks, my 
<br>
friend dealt in small businesses and my grandfather in livestock.  All knew at 
<br>
what price they could purchase their chosen commodity at guarenteed profit -- 
<br>
almost certainly.  When someone offered them their price, they would deal.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certainly those men had failures but all three did extremely well on 
<br>
the average.  In the end I don't regard Mr. Buffet as a stock market investor 
<br>
although he does buy stocks.  It seems his talent is finding really good 
<br>
profitable businesses that emotional people are willing to sell too cheaply on some 
<br>
given day.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me the illuminating question is this: if I do a Buffet type 
<br>
investigation of a business and its market and end up buy a stock paying $15 annual 
<br>
dividends like clockwork for $100 per share (that is his criteria for 
<br>
performance) and that stock goes to $50 per share if I do analysis of the stock only to 
<br>
discover nothing material has changed should I sell?
<br>
