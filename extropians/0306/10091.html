<br>
<p><em>    &gt; It [911] brought out the current policies to light, didn't it?
</em><br>
<p>If you think 911 will ever lead the American people to demand their
<br>
government have a more sympathetic policy toward Palestine then you must be
<br>
smoking some very funny cigarettes.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;There's documented proof all over the place of Israeli's human rights
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;violations
</em><br>
<p>Sure there is, big deal. The world is full of injustice and every people has
<br>
had bad things happen to them and Palestinians are no exception, but if you
<br>
want to explain the unprecedented volcanic rage consuming the entire Islamic
<br>
world from Algeria to Indonesia you're going to have to come up with some
<br>
unprecedented horror inflicted on all of Islam (not just the tiny percentage
<br>
that is Palestinian) the likes of which no other people have ever
<br>
experienced
<br>
in the history of the world; and after that you need to explain why Jews
<br>
don't crash airliners into German skyscrapers.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Islam is a brotherhood, and ALL muslims are troubled when
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; one of them is attacked.
</em><br>
<p>Brotherhood? Muslims have killed far more Muslims than the West could ever
<br>
dream of doing.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; So then let them democratically elect their brainless thugs than
</em><br>
<p>Let them? Islam has no history of democracy, it's not in their culture, even
<br>
today Turkey is the only country that comes close, but if they want to turn
<br>
democratic that's fine with me. However even if they have a vote and decide
<br>
that all Americans should die I'm still not going down without a fight. You
<br>
mention democracy a lot, you seem to think it will solve all the world's
<br>
problems, it's kinda cute.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;But ya did get your ass spanked in Vietnam
</em><br>
<p>True, but judging from what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq it doesn't look
<br>
like that's going to happen again anytime soon. Muslims make lousy soldiers,
<br>
especially Arabs.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;you support Israel
</em><br>
<p>You have a simplistic black and white attitude, the Arabs are the good guys
<br>
and Israel is the bad guy. I think they're both bad, the only difference is
<br>
one crashes airliners into American skyscrapers and one does not.
