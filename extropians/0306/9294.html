<em>&gt; &gt; What are some of the assumptions the DA makes to prove its point, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; which there is no evidence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Assumption: at this time in the evolution of the universe the measure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civs which die early (before diaspora) is not significantly lower than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure of civs which live to diaspora and beyond. If the above were not

</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure I follow this.  You're saying the DA assumes, basically,
<br>
that most civilizations have died out early?  And that if this were not
<br>
true, and most civilizations had flourished and spread widely through
<br>
space, then our early birth rank would not be worrisome?
<br>
<p>I think your reasoning is that if most civilizations were successful like
<br>
this, then we are likely to succeed, too.  Given that fact, we might
<br>
be surprised to find ourselves so early in our history, with the vast
<br>
majority of humans yet to be born.  This might be something of a puzzle,
<br>
but we would still be confident that the human race had a long future
<br>
ahead of it, because so many other species had similarly succeeded.
<br>
Does this sound about right?
<br>
<p>If so, I think the problem is that this viewpoint doesn't face up to the
<br>
internal inconsistency within itself.  It's just not a plausible picture,
<br>
since it requires the incredibly unlikely coincidence of us having a
<br>
birth number that is perhaps in the first millionth or billionth of all
<br>
humans who will be born.  The chances of this viewpoint being true have to
<br>
be seen in the face of these million to one odds against it.
<br>
<p>If you started off confident that humans would survive because so many
<br>
other peoples have done it, the analysis of the DA ought to shake your
<br>
confidence at least somewhat.  It ought to cause you to revise your
<br>
estimate downward of the human race's chances for success.  Your early
<br>
birth rank is evidence against a successful human diaspora.  You may
<br>
still believe that it can happen, if the evidence from alien success is
<br>
even greater than the odds-against generated by the DA.  But still, you
<br>
have to count the DA as evidence in the negative direction.  And that's
<br>
all that the DA asks, that you take it into consideration and revise
<br>
your estimates downward.
<br>
<p>Let me give you my version of the DA.  I think it's about as simple as
<br>
things can get.
<br>
<p>90% of the members of a species will have a birth rank between 5% and
<br>
95% of the total range.  That's tautological.  It follows that if each
<br>
member reasons that his birth rank is likely to be around the middle,
<br>
plus or minus an order of magnitude or so, then 90% of the time, this
<br>
reasoning will be correct.
<br>
<p>Our birth rank is something like 60 billion.  If we apply this reasoning,
<br>
we would conclude that there will be something like 6 billion to 600
<br>
billion more humans born.  Given our current population and growth rates,
<br>
that corresponds to perhaps 50 - 5000 years.  If our population were
<br>
to start growing rapidly again, it would bring the high figure down a
<br>
great deal, to just a few hundred years.
<br>
<p>Now, we might be wrong in this conclusion.  But over the history of the
<br>
human race, 90% of the people who reason like this will be correct.
<br>
Without a very strong reason to believe otherwise, which I don't think
<br>
we have, it seems that we must very seriously consider the possibility
<br>
that we are within that 90%, and that the reasoning is correct.
<br>
