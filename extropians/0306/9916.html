<p>Actually I think you were quoting someone else. 
<br>
<p>My point is simply that stock trends don't exist, period.

<p>I'm glad for you if you've been banking profits from your stock trades, but
<br>
taking cash to the bank does not prove a thing.

<p>I bet Funny Cide to show in the Preakness last week. Poor Funny Cide and his
<br>
jockey and owner didn't win the Triple Crown, but as a show better I was
<br>
very happy that Funny Cide finished third. I won in the Preakness even
<br>
though my horse only showed. My win does not however prove that I'm
<br>
discovered a way to win at the ponies. (It is, however, a major statistical
<br>
project of mine. :-)
