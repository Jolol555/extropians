From: &quot;Hal Finney&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20Investing">hal@finney.org</a>&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; According to the efficient market theory, there are really no such things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as bull and bear markets.  They are optical illusions.
</em><br>
<p>Illussion schmillusion.  Even on the most bleeding-red-market day, there are
<br>
always stocks that are jumping on good news with investors lined up to buy.
<br>
And even on a bulliest of a market day, there are some stocks that are
<br>
dropping like flies on bad news with investors selling and bailing.
<br>
<p>But when I see most of my positions on Streamer with cute little minus signs
<br>
and the DJIA and NASDAQ and S&amp;P 500 all in red font, it's not an illusion -
<br>
it's a sucky stock day!
<br>
<p>As for the ability to make money in whatever market, for those investors and
<br>
traders who short (which helps liquidity), they can make money even in a
<br>
&quot;bear&quot; market when stocks are plummeting.  And traditional investors tend to
<br>
lose money if they're just holding stocks when the market is in a downslide.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is, it is impossible at any time to predict whether the market
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is going to rise or fall.  You can't say &quot;we are in the middle of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bull/bear market and therefore the market is more likely than not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rise/fall in the next few months.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>... you're right, any more than you can say that a particular stock won't
<br>
rise or fall on a particular day.  And, yet ... during the dot.com salad
<br>
days, one could throw darts at the Wall Street Journal to pick stocks and
<br>
still make money.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can only recognize bull and bear markets retroactively.
</em><br>
<p>... yes, but ... read the last sentence in my previous paragraph.  I don't
<br>
know about you, but when my stocks were making tens of thousands of dollars
<br>
a month every month for a while - I was suspecting (strongly) that we were
<br>
in a bull market (somewhat).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When you see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a time when prices tended to rise, you call that a bull market.  When you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see a time where prices tended to fall, you call that a bear market.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When prices didn't have much of a trend, you'll say that was neither.
</em><br>
<p>When prices don't have much of a trend, it's a &quot;flat&quot; market, yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So it doesn't make sense to say, buy stocks during a bull market and sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; during a bear market.  That's because it is impossible at any time to say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the future course of stock prices will be.  All you can do is look
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back, and with the wisdom of hindsight, say that you should have bought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here and sold there.  But that's not a way to make future decisions.
</em><br>
<p>It makes general sense to lock in profits during a bull market.  Don't worry
<br>
about selling and then seeing a stock go up, just take profits.  It often
<br>
makes more sense to sell in a bull market (or bullish phase of it), and buy
<br>
at or near the bottom of the bear market (or bearish phase of it), not the
<br>
other way around.  It's the opposite of what many people tend to do.  And,
<br>
by studying the stock market, it is easier to make educated guesses.  There
<br>
are lots of guides out there to help you - the Internet has brought Wall
<br>
Street into your kitchen, bedroom or living room.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These observations are based both on theory and practice.  I studied
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some of the academic literature several years ago, and statistically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they found virtually no correlation between past price changes and future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price changes.
</em><br>
<p>Not certain what you mean.  I personally won't be persuaded or dissuaded
<br>
trying to make sense of statistics and correlations.  Playing the market is
<br>
a skill, and not for the timid.  But its permutations are not difficult to
<br>
grasp (and sometimes only after losing a bit of money, but then any good
<br>
education can be expensive).
