It is time for a reality check in America as far as jobs are concerned. The days of Being a &quot;skilled&quot; laborer are soon to be over. The fact is that many so-called &quot;skilled&quot; labor jobs don't require many skills at all. This is why they have been moved to countries that have a largely uneducated population.
<br>
In the future, people in this country are going to be faced with a choice. To become educated, or to starve. Hopefully, the majority of people choose the former.
<br>
The argument that cheap labor overseas is going to kill our economy is just garbage. People can move into the country, or jobs can move out. It doesn;t matter. Eventually, economic expansion will improve the lives of everyone.

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;### This is incorrect - almost all Americans benefit from the globalization
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of the labor market by being able to buy services and products at a lower
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;price. Additionally, the foreign employees of American companies benefit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;from American capital and knowledge, which enables them to purchase globally
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;produced goods.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Freedom is good for you.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;If one has a high-paying job one can, indeed benefit from globalization. On the other hand, if hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs go overseas, and those being paid are paid at a tenth the wage-level that the American IT workers were paid at; there is no way that they, as the &quot;new&quot; workers can ever afford goods and services offered by American companies.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;In essence, the &quot;new country&quot; employees are not part of the American economic cycle. Its not, as if, the Parent company which off-shores these jobs, invests in many new jobs in the US. Why should they, if goods and services are so inexpensive overseas?  This also leads to the de-stablization of American society because skilled jobs are no longer to be had, because of the corporation's cost savings. This can't be a good thing and is already and election issue and a &quot;class warfare&quot; issue as well.
