<p>
I used to argue quite a bit with Tom van Flandern 20 years ago on
<br>
the old Compuserve Science and Math Forum.  He had many of the same
<br>
incorrect ideas back then that he is pushing now.  Yet somehow he had
<br>
managed to maintain the image of a respectable mainstream scientist,
<br>
and even was giving public speeches and leading science-based tours as
<br>
an expert astronomer.
<br>
<p>The speed of gravity is perhaps worth talking about.  What does that
<br>
mean, the speed of gravity?  When we speak of the speed of light, or
<br>
the speed of sound, that has a pretty well defined meaning.  We can send
<br>
a pulse of sound or light and see how long it takes to get from A to B.
<br>
<p>But gravity is different, it is more pervasive.  It's always there,
<br>
between A and B.  It's like asking for the speed of temperature, or
<br>
pressure, or density.
<br>
<p>This ambiguity seemed to be the foundation for many of TvF's mistakes.
<br>
Here is an example he used.  Imagine we have two masses orbiting around
<br>
their common center of gravity, like a binary star system.  In Newtonian
<br>
physics, this is a stable system.  And for it to be stable, each star
<br>
must be gravitationally attracted to where the other star is precisely at
<br>
that moment.  That is, the acceleration vector has to point directly at
<br>
the other star.  If the vector is off, then the star system will speed
<br>
up or slow down and the orbits are unstable.
<br>
<p>Then TvF argued, if we modify this Newtonian picture to incorporate
<br>
relativity, then the stars should not be attracted to the current
<br>
position of the other star.  Instead, they should be attracted to where
<br>
the other star was in the past.  If the two stars are a light-day apart,
<br>
then they should be attracted to where the other star was one day ago.
<br>
That's because of the &quot;speed of gravity&quot;, it should take that long for
<br>
information about the other star's position to get to this star.
<br>
<p>However, if star systems worked like this, binary star systems would be
<br>
highly unstable and their orbits would quickly be destroyed.  Since this
<br>
does not happen, TvF concluded that the speed of gravity must be infinite,
<br>
or at least a lot faster than c, to explain why stars are attracted to
<br>
the current position of the other star.
<br>
<p>Now, as described, this is a pretty good relativity paradox.  It does
<br>
have a certain plausibility.  It would be a good problem to teach a
<br>
student of special and general relativity, to help explain the concepts.
<br>
<p>However, it is nothing more than that.  There is no difficulty in
<br>
accounting for the stability of orbits in relativity theory, and this
<br>
is done without invoking a speed greater than c for gravity.
<br>
<p>The simplest way to explain it is to consider a single, linearly moving
<br>
star and to consider its gravitational field.  The field surrounds the
<br>
star and moves with it.  Imagine the field as a physical object built of
<br>
wood, a gigantic framework that surrounds the star.  As the star moves,
<br>
the framework moves too.
<br>
<p>As the star passes by an observer, the field points to the current
<br>
position of the star.  That's because the field is moving uniformly with
<br>
the star.  In the case of a wooden framework, the beams would point
<br>
directly at where the star is right now, because that is how the frame is
<br>
built.
<br>
<p>It turns out that gravity is not unique in this respect.  Electric fields
<br>
work the same way.  If the star carried an electric charge, and you had
<br>
an instrument to detect it, the instrument would be attracted towards
<br>
the current position of the star, not to where the star was in the past.
<br>
It's for the same reason, that the electric field moves along with
<br>
the star.
<br>
<p>The orbital example is a little more complex, because each star is moving
<br>
in an ellipse.  The details of the curved motion affect the star slightly
<br>
differently than the remote parts of the field, so the field does not
<br>
point exactly at the star.  But it's very close.  The discrepancy does
<br>
cause orbits to decay, but at an extremely slow rate.
<br>
<p>The truth is, orbits are unstable in GR, but the degree is insignificant
<br>
for all but the heaviest objects in the smallest orbits.  This orbital
<br>
decay predicted by general relativity can be explained by the creation of
<br>
gravitational waves as the stars orbit, a new phenomenon not predicted
<br>
by Newtonian physics.  This orbital instability can also be seen as
<br>
a manifestation of gravity not being directed exactly at the current
<br>
position of the attracting object.
<br>
<p>So the bottom line is that TvF's example does not show that gravity moves
<br>
faster than c; in fact, the phenomenon actually illustrates how accurate
<br>
relativity theory is at explaining the details of orbital mechanics.
<br>
And of course there is no need for anything to move faster than light
<br>
in relativity.
<br>
<p>Despite the attempts by me and others to explain these details, TvF was
<br>
unconvinced, and apparently the same thing is true today.  I can't help
<br>
noticing that he gets a lot more attention this way than he would if he
<br>
were the ordinary NASA Astronomer that he claims to be.
