In a message dated 6/1/2003 6:16:57 AM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:puglisi@arcetri.astro.it?Subject=Re:%20Boy%20Genius%20or%20Craft%20Idiot?">puglisi@arcetri.astro.it</a> writes: the &quot;christian&quot; that you saw before &quot;religious nut&quot; is just 
<br>
your imagination. At least, this is what one gets when reading what you wrote. 
<br>
Why do you react so violently to such an innocent example, giving it a 
<br>
political and not-in-my-backyard view?  Ciao, Alfio
<br>
<p>Afio,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at all.  Alfio.  In this society of English speaking people when 
<br>
you speak of religious people, nuts or otherwise, you are speaking of 
<br>
Christians and Jews.  There is a small smattering of other religions but those are the 
<br>
primary ones.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If Olga had intended to exempt the majority of religious people 
<br>
(Christians and Jews) in her audience she should have said so on one of the many 
<br>
times she called them &quot;religious nuts.&quot;  No, to assume that Olga intended to 
<br>
insult Christians and Jews as well whatever minority religions are present is 
<br>
entirely a fair inference.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition Olga, according to another poster, has included the leader 
<br>
of Israel as a &quot;religious nut&quot; when he is an atheist.  She has not included 
<br>
at least three atheists that have each murdered millions as examples of 
<br>
murderous people.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But to discover her greatest offense you have to listen to what she 
<br>
didn't say.  At no time has she recognized the distinction between philosophy 
<br>
and science -- or between science and art, if you please.  She apparently 
<br>
examines everything through the eyes of science and only science.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Science is wonderful but it does not even attempt to answer the great 
<br>
questions of life.  That is what philosophy and great art attempts to do.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Olga insists on the right to blast off insulting large segments of our 
<br>
population when she obviously has not tried to learn of that which she is 
<br>
insulting -- she plays God and that is her biggest offense.  She has the power of 
<br>
speaking in ignorance and having what she said be so.  When challenged she 
<br>
evades.  She is God.
<br>
Ron h.
