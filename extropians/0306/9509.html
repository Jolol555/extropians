<em>&gt; (Harvey Newstrom &lt;<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20Martha%20Stewart%20and%20her%20Merrill%20Lynch%20Broker">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why insider trading is illegal for the company:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The theory is that the stockholders own the company. Any material
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information that would affect purchasing or selling decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be disclosed to the owners affected.  Any failure to do so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jeopardizes the owner's assets and demonstrates a lack of due
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diligence.  
</em><br>
<p>But of course this could be easily handled by contract law instead of
<br>
being imposed by fiat: a stock exchange could require that all stocks
<br>
sold on its exchange meet certain requirements, including the obligation
<br>
for directors to disclose all material facts to stockholders in a timely
<br>
way before taking personal profit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why insider trading is illegal for the broker:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Stock brokers are supposed to be working for the benefit of their clients.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a conflict of interest for them to selectively censor the information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they pass to clients to manipulate their actions against their own interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in favor of the brokerage.  To disclose different information or advice to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different clients is clear evidence of misrepresentation.
</em><br>
<p>And again, is clearly a matter for contract and tort law.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why insider trading is illegal for the trader:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is nothing in the law that prevents people from using their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains to predict stocks and make lots of money.  The legal problem only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes in from receiving information secretly that should have been delivered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to somebody else...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Instead of delivering the required information to the rightful owners (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stockholders, all of them), this valuable information is secretly diverted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the insider traders.  Like fences, they profit from receiving the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information only if all of the rightful owners (stockholders) are deprived
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the information.  They cannot profit from inside information if it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equally shared with the rest of the stockholders.
</em><br>
<p>Again, all quite well handled by contract law.
<br>
<p>I see no compelling reason for legislation in this matter. If stock
<br>
markets that contractually restrict insider trading are better than
<br>
those that don't, then they'll succeed in the marketplace. If they
<br>
don't, then the legislation is counterproductive.
<br>
