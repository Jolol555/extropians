</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; On your points 3 and 4; one might then conclude that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disuasion of radical, militant Islam as practiced by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Salafists, Wahabbis, and Shiite Ayatollahs, as well as their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Baathist cohorts, would thus be in your interests?
</em><br>
<p>Ramez responded
<br>
<p><em>&gt; IMO, the reduction of fundamentalism in the world is in just about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone's interests.  Certainly I think it's in the interests of both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US and vast majority of people living in the middle east.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely. Easier said than done though. It isn't clear exactly why
<br>
&quot;fundamentalism&quot; (basically a response of traditional religions to
<br>
scientific modernity) should have such a receptive audience in some parts of
<br>
the world and not others. It does seem though that the key to undermining it
<br>
is changing the social role of women (see Callum Brown's &quot;Death of Christian
<br>
Britain&quot; for a discussion of this).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Egyptian government has surely followed the Saudi practice of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; blame the USA since Sadat's assasination, as a means of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deflecting due criticism for failed economic policies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  Most of the arab governments use the US (and Israel) as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convenient scapegoats to deflect people's attention away from their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; awful situation and the vast corruption of the dictatorial regimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that rule them.
</em><br>
<p>Why is this misleading propaganda credible though? (Or is it - I know it
<br>
isn't in Iran but don't know about Egypt or the ME proper.)
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing seems to be more poweful then power in this old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world, what are we to do to disusade militant, radical, Islam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (and its non-Muslims supporters) from practicing nuclear
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guerilla warfare?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Prosperity and freedom undermine fundamentalism.  Fundamentalism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thrives in areas where people are oppressed, poor, uneducated, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have few prospects for the future.
</em><br>
<p>This may be true but I don't think terrorism is commonly associated with
<br>
these factors. Typically terrorists come from an educated and privileged
<br>
background (they seem to have disproportionate likelihood of having an
<br>
engineering qualification for some reason). They are usually aspirant
<br>
would-be elites or to put it another way people who feel they ought to be
<br>
higher up the pecking order than they are. All this has been true since at
<br>
least the 1860s when the first modern style terrorist movements appeared. So
<br>
reducing poverty will be good in itself and will help somewhat but it's not
<br>
enough by itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So again, I see tackling oppression and poverty as the only viable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long-term strategies to reducing terrorism.  And I see US cultural and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic might as the most effective tools to accomplish this.
</em><br>
<p>Again I agree that &quot;soft power&quot; is the best strategy. However if undermining
<br>
religious fundamentalism is one of the aims doesn't this involve
<br>
disseminating what are ultimately anti-religious notions (memes if you
<br>
prefer)?
