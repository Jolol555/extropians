<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; cryonics is that I just not convinced that, appearances

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We've seen these topics arise repeatedly on this list, with very little or
<br>
no change of viewpoint resulting from extensive discussion.  This seems to
<br>
indicates that the prior beliefs we're dealing with are at fundamental
<br>
levels which are rarely open to self examination, and thus very resistant to
<br>
change.  It seems that these prior beliefs or biases come mainly from our
<br>
evolutionary programming, and are further reinforced by cultural
<br>
programming.  The difficulty is perhaps not so much with learning more about
<br>
these subjects, but with the need to *unlearn* a lot of the previous
<br>
programming.
<br>
<p>Many persons with scientific and philosophical backgrounds struggle with
<br>
concepts such as the nature of conciousness, personal identity, morality,
<br>
free will, all of which appear to be contingent on the evolutionarily based
<br>
sense of &quot;self&quot;.  This strong sense of &quot;I am me, and everything outside is
<br>
not me&quot; seems to prevent one from adopting the wider perspective by which
<br>
these apparently paradoxical topics become transparent (and then one can
<br>
discover and begin working on the next layer of the onion.)
<br>
<p>Earlier today someone (Rafal?) mentioned the chinese &quot;mu&quot; as an appropriate
<br>
response when no correct answer is possible due to the question not being
<br>
meaninful in the given context.  In such a case, widening the context
<br>
(greater scope of understanding) so the discussion illuminates both
<br>
viewpoints can lead to progress, but how can this be done effectively on a
<br>
list such as ours?
<br>
<p>I've dreamed of having a set of web pages, generated by a database relating
<br>
arguments, counter-arguments, and prior beliefs, in a way that would
<br>
interactively guide someone from their current view point to (one hopes) a
<br>
more enlightened view point.  Perhaps such a hypothetical system could
<br>
refine its data and methods by learning from each encounter.  Unfortunately,
<br>
such a system is currently impractical to program due to the combinatorial
<br>
explosion that it would involve.
<br>
<p>I thought that perhaps a group effort, collaborating on such a database
<br>
might make some progress toward this goal, but this now appears overly
<br>
idealistic given actual social dynamics.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the great Google will eventually lead the way toward enlightment for
<br>
all...
