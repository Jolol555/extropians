<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not true. No war, no war casualties.
</em><br>
<p>Right, so Saddam Hussein insisted on a war, and had *no* right to continue
<br>
his rule over the Iraqi people.  If Saddam had left, no war, and no war
<br>
causalties.  Yet you still blame the war causalities on the coalition, and
<br>
not the corrupt murderous dictator who felt it his right to rule over
<br>
millions of people.
<br>
<p>I will grant you that people may have
<br>
<em>&gt; died by the actions of their government, somewhat counteracting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between war and peace (slightly).
</em><br>
<p>*may*?  Whats the figure now, 300,000 in mass graves?  May!?  Yeah, im sure
<br>
ol Saddam would have just stopped his mass killings, oppressive rule, and
<br>
exploitation.  What about the deaths from the sanctions, which as a result
<br>
of the war, have been lifted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Remember, though, that you must also count the rioting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disturbance that has followed the war, and all the casualties incurred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, as part of the toll of the war.
</em><br>
<p>Again, the moral culpability lies on Saddam, not the Coalition.  Saddam and
<br>
the Baath party could have easily agreed to and facilitied a peaceful change
<br>
in government, and he *chose* not to.  *chose*.  No power outages, no water
<br>
shortages, no phone problems, no cluster bombs, no rioting. etc. etc. etc.
<br>
Saddam is still to blame for each and every death, you completely MISS the
<br>
point that he has NO RIGHT to be a dictator, and thus anything that results
<br>
from his insisting he remain a dictator he is morally culpable for.
<br>
<p>You have no right to take over your neighbors house by force, and are
<br>
morally culpable in everything that happens as a result.  In the US system
<br>
of law, you are held morally accountable if anyone dies, even a member of
<br>
the group committing a crime, while in the act of committing a crime.  You
<br>
are the criminal taking over the neighbors house, if you friend helping you
<br>
dies in the process, you are held morally accountable.  You have no more
<br>
right to take over a neighborhood than your neighboors house, and you have
<br>
no more right to take over a country than you have your neighboorhood.  You
<br>
have no right to continue to rule over that country.  You are morally
<br>
accountable for every death that occurs from the freeing of those you rule
<br>
over.  How can you DARE imply that I would be as morraly culpable from
<br>
deaths that result in my attempt to free the neighborhood, or country, you
<br>
have taken by force, when you have no right to rule that country!!!
<br>
<p>In the US system of law, you are also held morally accountable for deaths
<br>
that result from 'depraved indifference', which I assert each and ever war
<br>
opposer is guilty of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is difficult for me to even began to coalesce the reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; why such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statement is repulsive to me as an extropian and an person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who values human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Come on, that's a bit strong. The statement wasn't supposed to support or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppose the war itself; I was attempting to point out that there are two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sides to the coin of who is responsible for deaths in Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah, and both sides of that coin have the head of Saddam Hussein on it.
<br>
Your statemt implies it does not.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I
<br>
<em>&gt; really have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strongly object to the idea that an aggressive, invading power bears no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility for the deaths; it *always* does. Sometimes that cost is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; warranted, as it may well yet turn out to be in this case. However, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unescapable that when you attack a sovereign country and kill its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you bear the responsibility for those deaths. Anyone is allowed self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Dictators are not allowed that right when they are defending their continued
<br>
empowerment and enslavement of people.  Your comments continue to illustrate
<br>
your strange conept of ethics.  As Mike Lorrey pointed out, you are blaiming
<br>
the hostage rescuers for the deaths of the hostages.  Saddam held every
<br>
citizen in Iraq hostage, and his mass graves and murderous track record
<br>
prove as much.  Yet you blame the deaths that result from his removal from
<br>
power on the rescuers, not the hostage taker.
<br>
<p>&lt;scroll past red herrings&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; As far as &quot;as an extropian&quot; goes, I am quite unconvinced that you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evaluated this war action using the tools of an extropian. Is state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggression dynamist? Does it enhance liberty? Is it constructive, does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance our knowledge of ourselves or the universe? Is it rational (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst realpolitik sense perhaps). War, as a tool, is possibly one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least extropic choices that you can make. It is statist, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interferes with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liberty, it destroys with abandon.
</em><br>
<p>bla bla, all irrelevant to Saddam's morally culpability.  You are nothing
<br>
less than a moral relavitist, or have such fleeting definitions of your
<br>
ethical principles that they sway and bend with the slightest breeze.
<br>
<p>Is state pacifism progressive?  Does it enhance liberty (no) Is it
<br>
constructive (no) Does it advance our knowledge of the universe (no) Is it
<br>
rational? (no) Apathy, deprativity, pacifism, ARE the least extropic choices
<br>
that you can make.
<br>
<p>Does saddam hussein have a right to be a dictator, yes or no?
<br>
<p>Please present your case that WWI resulted in fewer liberties
<br>
<p>Please present your case that WWII resulted in fewer world liberties
<br>
<p>Please present your case that the Cold war resulted in fewer liberties
<br>
<p>Please present your case that this war will result in fewer liberties.
<br>
<p>The fact is, no two democratic nations have ever been at war, and no
<br>
democratic nation has ever waged war on another.  This century has seen
<br>
fewer wars in the world than any century before it.  The previous century
<br>
saw some ten times as many wars as this, and the one before than a similiar
<br>
increase.  The are fewer and fewer wars, and more and more free people in
<br>
the world, despite the moral cowardice presented by persons such as
<br>
yourself.
<br>
<p>This is not to say that I think war is
<br>
<em>&gt; always unquestionably wrong. It is that war is the tool of last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resort, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then to be questioned, and the aggressor must always carry the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stain of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable blood on its collective hands.
</em><br>
<p>And Saddam was merely the innocent victim in this event, with the coalition
<br>
as the evil aggressors.  You ignore, of course, the case for pre-emptive
<br>
strikes as a form a self defense, insisting unabashadly that the coalition
<br>
was an 'aggressor' did you forget the Gulf War?  Where Saddam invaded a
<br>
neighboring country that we agreed to protect in case of such invasion?  The
<br>
resolutions that resulted in this war came about as a flagrant disregard by
<br>
IRAQ of those agreements to end that War.  On multiple grounds Saddam's
<br>
regime was the aggressor.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Regardless of your opposition to the Iraq war, had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goal of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coalition been simple to remove Saddam just because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wanted to, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would have *still* had more moral validity than a murderous dictator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; remaining in power, simply because he was a murderous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dictator.  Dictators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have *no right* to be dictators!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may very well have had more moral validity, but you are comparing two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative numbers of great magnitude.
</em><br>
<p>it might very well!!!?? Did it or didnt it!? How *much* more?  only a
<br>
little?  Again, dispicable ethics.  The Coalition removing a murderous
<br>
dictator from power 'might' have had more moral validity that said murderous
<br>
dictator remaining in power?  Natasha, these are the kinds of twisted
<br>
ethical systems I am talking about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me pose a different question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A little googling (not all that much, so I could be mistaken)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tells me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraq war has/will cost the US government (ie: the US people) between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US$100 and US$200 billion. That's a lot of money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can look at a figure like that as an extropic potential. The US has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spent US$200 billion in extropic potential in waging this war. Forgetting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questions of moral validity, etc etc, I would ask the list this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given the choice, what would you rank as the most extropic way to expend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US$200 billion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I might post a response to this myself; I'll have to think on it.
</em><br>
<p>All interesting questions which I will contemplate, but completely
<br>
irrelevant to Saddams moral culpability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Every single person who died in the coalition war did so ONLY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; because Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; did not want to give up his control over the 20 million or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not correct. Choices were made on both sides, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly each side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carries a moral burden (assuming some consistent set of rules). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agressors hands can never be clean.
</em><br>
<p>Again, you paint the coalition as a patent aggressor, which paints a moral
<br>
picture of its own, that you disgregard pre-emptive strikes as a form of
<br>
self defense and disregard the pre-existing military aggresion by IRAQ that
<br>
the UN resolutions were born from.   Care to elaborate on your requirements
<br>
for the moral justification of a pre-emptive strike?  Care to present the
<br>
case that this war was not an escalation of the Gulf War, the agreements
<br>
which ended that having been broken by IRAQ?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Please explain to me your ethical principles that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; place his choice in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this conflict of staying in power and opposing the coalition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; efforts in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; morally valid catagory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I simply can not fathom how any extropian can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consider Saddam's actions in this situation as morally valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't defend Saddam Hussein. I defend neither side - big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negative numbers.
</em><br>
<p>Disgusting in itself.  Is the US as bad as a world presence as Saddam
<br>
Hussien?  I invite you to imagine a world controlled by Saddam, and then
<br>
convince me that neither side is worth defending.  Rubbish, you wouldnt even
<br>
have a computer nor an internet to surf on if Saddam was the world leading
<br>
power, you, in all likelyhood, would be either a poor peasant farmer, dead,
<br>
or never have existed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's no necessity to hand out black and white hats; the world is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boolean (unless we are in a sim :-)
</em><br>
<p>You did not answer the question.  You clearly indicate that if they are not
<br>
morally equally, then perhaps one *might* be morally more valid than
<br>
another, why?  why not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Given his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; past track record of murder, future likely hood of murder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; track record of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wars and aggressiveness, systematic effort to wipe out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kurds, slaughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of some 50,000 shiites, suspicions of harboring WMD, economic control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resulting in the untolds thousands of deaths, etc. etc I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not even began
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to understand how you place the moral culpability of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deaths on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people attempting to STOP that, instead of the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; choosing and insisting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that he must continue it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, that's not actually true. The coalition of the willing went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in to stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; development and use of WMDs. Laudable self interest, if it is true (??).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, the saving of the iraqi people was *not* the driver for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action.
</em><br>
<p>So?  Again the primary motivation is irrelevant.  If the Iraqi people are
<br>
freed from a murderous tyrant, I dont care if Bush's primary motivation was
<br>
tossing a few chicken bones and reading their divine meaning.  Freeing the
<br>
Iraqi people was certainly not ANYWHERE in the list of Saddams motivations
<br>
for remaining a murderous DICTATOR!!!  Ah, but the coalitions efforts
<br>
*might* have been more valid.  Again, disgusting.  Simply because 'freeing
<br>
the IRAQ people' even appeared on the coalition list of goals justifies
<br>
their moral highground over Saddam remaining in power!  Yet you insist the
<br>
coalition bears more of the blame
<br>
<p>As I and other have argued previouslly on this list, motivations are not
<br>
relevant, it is actions that are relevant.  We can argue all day long what
<br>
the true motivations of the coalition were, oil, revenge, WMD, free Iraq,
<br>
democractic Arab Nation, etc. etc.  We can judge from the stated goals,
<br>
which did include freeing Iraq (Hence, 'Operation Iraqi Freedom', and not
<br>
'Operation Find WMD')  It is the ACTIONS we must judge on.  The Actions in
<br>
the case have led to the ousting of a murderous tyrant, the freeing of some
<br>
20 million people, the ending of a monopoly over the worlds largest energy
<br>
reserves by a murderous tryant who used said energy reserves for murder and
<br>
tyranny, the setting up of a democratic arab nation to stem the tide of Arab
<br>
fundamentalist Islamic hatred, and to curtail the creation and spread of
<br>
WMD.  Lets compare the results of this action with Saddams remaining in
<br>
power, shall we?
<br>
<p>*might* be more morally valid!!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To which you did not respond.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are on my killfile. Sorry. I only see your posts second hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in other's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replies.
</em><br>
<p>Then why do you ask me questions?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure that I didn't say that. Got a direct quotation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Emlyn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Perhaps it is only evidence that you want to sheild yourself from critics
<br>
of you strange system of ethics.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Just to clarify, I shall ask you the same question I asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Damien, and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can choose to not answer as he has of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Is Saddam Hussain morally culpable for the deaths of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; civilians in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Coalition lead effort to remove said murderous tyrant from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; power, or is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coalition morally culpable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both share some of the burden, of course. I believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalition must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wear the majority, as I've said above.
</em><br>
<p>THE COALITION MUST WEAR THE MAJORITY!!!!  Amazing.
<br>
<p>Again, Natasha, more evidence of the disturbing ethics present on the
<br>
Extropy list.  Emyln is saying that Saddam Hussein, as a murderous dictator,
<br>
with a track record of hundreds of thousands of deaths, had more of a moral
<br>
right to remain in power then the coalition had to oust him.  I am
<br>
completely flabbergasted.
<br>
<p>What about the right of the 20 million people under saddams murderous rule?
<br>
do they, at least, outweigh his right to continue to rule them?
<br>
<p>This is balanced by an
<br>
<em>&gt; altered future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is the result of their actions; how much so is impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared to the aftermath in Afganistan (ie: not stable democracy) it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very difficult, I think, to say thus far how much the war is justified by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the result.
</em><br>
<p>Given Saddams track record, unless the coalition led efforts kill more
<br>
people than would have died had Saddam remained in power, the the moral
<br>
validity is clear.  Of course, life is not the only thing that we value,
<br>
freedom and standard of living are valued also, have you compared these in
<br>
your possible future tallies?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are right that I am against the Iraq war. It is because, as I've said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above, from an extropian standpoint it stinks.
</em><br>
<p>Regardless of whether you supported the war or not, Saddam still had no
<br>
right to be a dictator, and thus when the coalition was knocking on the
<br>
doorstep every death that resulted HE is morally culpable for.
<br>
<p>For the record, does anyone have the right to be a dictator?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I wont outline it again
<br>
<em>&gt; (because I have above), but I really think that it should be clear that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must be a tool of last resort, if to be used at all. Not only is it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (spectacular) waste of resources and lives, it decreases our freedoms at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; home.
</em><br>
<p>Just like WWI and WWII did right?  They definately decreased our freedoms.
<br>
