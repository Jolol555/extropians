</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's talk more on the list about this.
</em><br>
<p>I don't know how much experience others have on the publishing side of
<br>
things as opposed to the writing side. I've been on both sides. I'd
<br>
like to hear what Damien finds is so fucked up about the print and mass
<br>
market distro markets right now. On demand printing is actually quite
<br>
useful these days so it isn't that difficult for an individual to
<br>
become their own publisher if they don't mind spending 6 months or so
<br>
learning the hand work in a larger printing company, then scaling that
<br>
down to smaller equipment affordable to keep in a home workshop. For
<br>
$10k I could start a publishing company today using used equipment and
<br>
bringing a lot of work in house and earn enough money to live fine off
<br>
of if I could build a portfolio of several dozen books to start with.
<br>
<p>One area that is not glamorous but is a growth industry is reprinting
<br>
books that are in the public domain, from ancient greek or other such
<br>
texts to rennaisance and enlightenment era, 19th century novels, etc.
<br>
<p>A horror writer I know (Thomas Monteleone) runs a home grown publishing
<br>
operation from his home in Grantham, NH such as I've described. He
<br>
supplements publishing income by providing other services, for example
<br>
he is a local supplier of printer cartridge recharging, which is
<br>
something that he already does for his own publishing needs.
<br>
<p>I find amusing the confluence of the publishing discussion at the same
<br>
time as the Extro1 freedom ship discussion. I am reminded of Vinge's
<br>
novel on Tatja Grimm, where a world travelling ship earned its keep as
<br>
a publishing house, doing its own distribution.
