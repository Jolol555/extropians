<p>I wonder.  Would it be worthwhile for the Extropians
<br>
site to host a classifieds section - especially given
<br>
today's economy?  You know most of the candidates
<br>
there
<br>
would have a certain set of beliefs, which some
<br>
companies would very much want in their company
<br>
culture.

</em><br>
<p>Now that, I think this list can do.  C'mon, everyone,
<br>
any ideas for pieces of TransHumanity, Inc. that we
<br>
could start up today for, say, under US$10 million?
<br>
Low cost orbital transport is already in the news (and
<br>
there are several companies trying for it, not that
<br>
there isn't room for new entrants and/or better
<br>
support
<br>
of the existing ones); what else seems feasable?
<br>
<p>Any killer apps for wearable computers/augmented
<br>
reality nearing marketability?  (Facial recognition
<br>
doesn't count yet: among other things, you'd need to
<br>
get the error rate way down before the market would go
<br>
for it, or so say the studies I've seen.)
<br>
<p>I can think of at least one biotech possibility I've
<br>
mentioned on this list before, but I'm sure there are
<br>
several - not even counting spinoffs of Big Pharma
<br>
companies (whom you'd need to have personal
<br>
connections
<br>
with to tap; I'm looking for ideas the Joe Average
<br>
Extropian could use today).
<br>
<p>What about 3D printers?  Are there models available
<br>
that you could load food stock into, and print out
<br>
edible sculptures?  Would edible sculptures be able to
<br>
support a business (and if so, with what service
<br>
area), or would you have to convince restaurants that
<br>
this was the latest trend, then support yourself
<br>
selling food printers, stock, and recipe software?
<br>
This seems like the kind of thing faux-fashionable
<br>
fast
<br>
food joints might like.  What other profitable uses
<br>
are
<br>
there for the state of the art?
<br>
<p>I'm sure I'm not the only one here who can dream this
<br>
stuff up - and, just as importantly, take a serious
<br>
look at it to see if it might have potential for
<br>
profit
<br>
within the next few years.
