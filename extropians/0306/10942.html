<p>Quite so. `Sacrifice' is it, exactly.

<p><em>&gt;But I

</em><br>
<p>I agree that this delusion will become common, because operationally, from
<br>
the outside, you *will* be dealing with the same person (or an improved
<br>
version), and the duplicates, from the inside, will recall the same
<br>
memories as the original. That's built in to the premise.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&quot;I still think that all you
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Only if he's an idiot. Obviously exact duplicates are *not* zombies, any
<br>
more than new children are zombies. The only real question is whether you
<br>
will *sacrifice yourself for your duplicate*. Many people on this list,
<br>
ironically enough, have enough Rand in their memetic substrate that they
<br>
regard the idea of self-sacrifice as noxious and wicked.
<br>
<p>You think I'm begging the question, of course. I think I'm pinpointing it.
