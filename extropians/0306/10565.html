</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I mean by &quot;patriotism&quot; is a love of one's country, but especially

</em><br>
<em>&gt; which conveys an emotional attachment that colors one's vision somewhat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is parallel to the love of a woman for her husband, or of a man for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his son.  One simply does not wish to hear bad things about them, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be most unlikely to pass on bad news about their character, except
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I love what this country was supposed to stand for and sometimes does but to 
<br>
often does not stand for in practice.   Loving those things means that I 
<br>
cannot affort to be dishonest about whether or not they are present and cared 
<br>
for.   Loving a country or a person does not allow the luxury of not seeing 
<br>
what is true if one really loves them instead of loving a fantasy rather than 
<br>
the reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

<em>&gt; I think of Eisenhower as a patriot.  But perhaps with your capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; letter you meant something else.  Or maybe you just know more about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him than do I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Ike certainly wasn't above telling it like it is to the best of his knowledge 
<br>
and ability.  His love was not at all blind.
