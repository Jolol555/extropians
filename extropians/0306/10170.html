Actually someone's really working on something cool :)
<br>
They've got a process to convert the gas into a crystalline
<br>
solid.  No containment problems/specialized transport necessary.
<br>
The trick is they've converted to a solid material already commercially
<br>
processed (for other purposes), thus making it economical.  I can't
<br>
remember specifically what gas it was (methane, propane etc), but
<br>
it was a combustable gas suitable for a converted gasoline engine.
<br>
I read the article back in January/February.  The main problem,
<br>
as I recall, was final distribution and consumption [similar
<br>
to the last mile problem with fiber vs copper].  Everybody's cars
<br>
are using gasoline, and to retrofit small distributors (e.g. not a
<br>
backbone supply) would be a pain... The former being significantly
<br>
more of a problem than the latter of course,
<br>
<p>And as to methane production in solar ponds (a technology I am not
<br>
familiar with I confess), one of the byproduct of alcohol fermentation
<br>
is
<br>
methane, and that *is* currently being bottled by the beer/alcohol
<br>
companies
<br>
for resale..

<em>&gt; I have heard, from what I consider to be an authoritative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; source, that international natural gas transport is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic (it would triple or quadruple prices).  Now perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is because one has to build special vessels with high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strength containers to compress it enough or cryogenic tanks 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to liquify it 
</em><br>
&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am willing to stand corrected if someone knows better.

<p>The Old Salt stands.  A quick google turned this up as an example:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mariport.com/Mariport%20Files/lng.htm">http://www.mariport.com/Mariport%20Files/lng.htm</a>
<br>
<p>But there's plenty more.  I know from recent meetings I've been in that
<br>
Korea has a substantial consumption of natural gas, all of which is
<br>
imported via ship.
<br>
<p>One of my firm's clients, El Paso Natural Gas (founded by a former
<br>
partner in the firm) was one of the pioneers in the field of building
<br>
the first generation of LNG tankers in the 1960s.  It was VERY high-tech
<br>
then but, although they still ain't your rusty old break bulk ships, LNG
<br>
tankers are relatively common today.  The global fleet may be as big as
<br>
100 vessels in 2003.
