</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sort of propulsion that would be used. Current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; installation would be fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hungry. One idea I have is that with that big flat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deck, we could install a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number of scrap airliner wings vertically on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pivoting masts. and make it a
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone?
</em><br>
<p>Nah.  If it's an Extropian boat, let's at least make
<br>
it 21st century. ^_-  If we aren't going to be landing
<br>
that many planes on that wide, flat surface, cover it
<br>
(as much as feasable) with solar panels.  (I'd
<br>
suggest nuclear, but I don't think that could be done
<br>
cheaply enough.  No question that it could be done for
<br>
enough money - civilian nuclear plants get their fuel
<br>
from somewhere - just on the amount of mone when this
<br>
is supposed to be cheap.)  It'd be slower than diesel,
<br>
perhaps, but a primarily residential ship probably
<br>
wouldn't want to go that fast anyway.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I guess it could possibly work as a commercial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; venture/lifestyle opportunity, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if a bunch of the people were craftsman, machinists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  A carrier actually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has lots of cargo space (for the planes, and their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; parts and fuel, mostly).  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THe men live in a fraction of the total space.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you had 500 men with 20K 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and some mechanical skills, electrical skills,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piloting, etc., yeah, global 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shipping seems to be a growth industry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (infortunately for the factory workers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of America).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fix it up, find manufacturers who need cargo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shipped. Of course, there is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insurance to consider, but since all the operators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be owners, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be simplified somewhat.
</em><br>
<p>Is it a residence or a cargo shipper?  If the latter,
<br>
container ships do that much better, so you'd rapidly
<br>
find yourself outpriced.  But the former might be a
<br>
viable niche, especially if it was anchored just
<br>
outside US waters (to be able to move inside, if
<br>
non-US pirates came a-calling; possibly near the
<br>
border to Canadian waters if said pirates were the
<br>
type the US wouldn't act against).  It'd still be a
<br>
carrier of sorts, just that most of its child craft
<br>
would be watercraft instead of aircraft.
