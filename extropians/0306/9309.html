<p>The first letter of the Hebrew alphabet is the Aleph.  &quot;Aleph&quot; means ox.
<br>
(Is that close enough to a buffalo for you?)  It is also the number one,
<br>
because like the later Romans, they used letters to represent numbers.  The
<br>
earliest form of Aleph was a little ox-head figure carved into clay.  It was
<br>
used to tabulate cattle.  The first mark of writing that became the first
<br>
letter of the first written language meant one-ox or one-aleph.  Their first
<br>
letter literally was both the one and the letter &quot;A&quot; and the ox.  This was
<br>
not a code invented later for numerology.  Rather, this was inherent in
<br>
their view of the universe.  To them 1=A=ox was the same as Ayn Rand's A=A.
<br>
It was so obvious that a thing was itself and that aleph=aleph=aleph, that
<br>
the metaphor qabalistic gematria was reality for them.
