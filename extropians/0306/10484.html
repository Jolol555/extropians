<em>&gt; Most AI researchers that I know of are not overly concerned with

<em>&gt; design problems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But as you point out, roboticists do care about computing power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find this an interesting dichotomy, actually.  Roboticists, computer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vision researchers, and the like deal in interacting with the messy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical world.
</em><br>
<p>This makes sense to me.  Robotics is hardware.  AI is software.
<br>
Characteristically speaking, software is more predictable and can be made to
<br>
work.  We are just working on making it smaller, cooler, faster.  Software
<br>
is not very predictable.  We seem to be making it more bloated, more
<br>
&quot;cooler&quot;, and slower.
<br>
<p>In the future we want the AI(software) to design the hardware.  If only we
<br>
could figure out a way to do the reverse!  This is probably where uploading,
<br>
simulation, and evolution come in.  This might be a creative compromise, but
<br>
it also might lead us to building things we don't understand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Right now if I had infinite computing power and wanted to do it I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; employ an evolutionary technique.  Unfortunately, this is Eliezer's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worst nightmare - a new form of intelligence grown by evolution and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not necessarily friendly to us.
</em><br>
<p>I agree - on the nightmare part.  This also is similar to how software is
<br>
built today.  It is &quot;evolved&quot;.  Not in the true sense of the word as we mean
<br>
it.  But it grows in little pieces.  As things break, we find a way to
<br>
adapt.  It becomes a bloated inefficient collection of junk code rather than
<br>
a sleak, elegant, well-designed thing.  In fact, some people have argued
<br>
that faster hardware helps prop-up poorer programs.  If you have excess
<br>
speed, why be efficient?  If you have excess memory and disk, why conserve?
<br>
If you can reboot in a couple of minutes, who cares if you crash?  But for
<br>
AI, I certainly don't want errors, bugs, security holes, and crashes every
<br>
day.
