<a href="http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,59133,00.html">http://www.wired.com/news/medtech/0,1286,59133,00.html</a>
<br>
<p><p>Getting a gene inside cells to cure disease is the essence of gene therapy. 
<br>
It's also the biggest obstacle to making gene therapy work. 
<br>
<p>Cells do what they can to prevent foreign objects from entering, so 
<br>
researchers have tried various methods to trick the cell into allowing access. None so 
<br>
far have been successful, and several gene therapy trials have been halted for 
<br>
safety reasons. 
<br>
<p>Researchers studying a technology called electroporation, which uses pulses 
<br>
of electric current to prompt cells to become porous, believe their method 
<br>
might be a safer option. 
<br>
<p>&quot;People have tried gene therapy with retroviral or adenoviruses, and you have 
<br>
manufacturing issues, safety issues,&quot; said Robert Goodenow, vice president of 
<br>
business development at Gentronics in San Diego, California. &quot;We feel that 
<br>
using a physical method like electroporation can end up being cheap and safe.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Viruses are good at getting inside cells, so researchers have tried to 
<br>
piggyback genes on them while altering the virus to remove its harmful qualities. 
<br>
But that method resulted in the death of 18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger in 1999, 
<br>
and researchers as well as patients have been wary of the viral method ever 
<br>
since. 
<br>
<p>Electroporation, on the other hand, doesn't require a viral vector, since it 
<br>
uses a transient electric current to open up the cell wall. Researchers at 
<br>
Genetronics have made progress recently using this method to deliver an HIV 
<br>
vaccine, as well as to grow new blood vessels in animals. 
<br>
<p>Their work with HIV is a collaboration with Chiron, the biotech company that 
<br>
provided the DNA, and is closest to being tested in humans. Now, they're 
<br>
testing the technology in primates, where they've seen encouraging results. 
<br>
<p>The gene-therapy vaccine introduces a bit of HIV DNA into cells using 
<br>
electroporation. In primates, the treatment has induced a strong immune response that 
<br>
makes the researchers hopeful it will also work in humans. 
<br>
<p>Humans have two kinds of immunity: antibodies that attack specific foreign 
<br>
entities in the body, and T-cells, a type of white blood cell that kills 
<br>
infected cells. T-cells are most important in the fight against HIV -- antibodies 
<br>
alone can't kill the virus. 
<br>
<p>&quot;If you're an HIV patient and you have generated a strong antibody response, 
<br>
that's not going to help you unless you can develop a strong T-cell response 
<br>
also,&quot; Goodenow said. &quot;We enhanced the production of not only antibodies but 
<br>
also T-cells.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Genetronics is also using electroporation along with a balloon catheter -- 
<br>
similar to the type used in an angiogram -- to deliver DNA that encourages the 
<br>
growth of blood vessels. 
<br>
<p>Cardiovascular disease can cause the death of peripheral blood vessels, which 
<br>
can lead to ulcers, infection and even amputation. 
<br>
<p>To avoid this, Genetronics, in collaboration with Boheringer Ingleheim has 
<br>
developed a catheter connected to a balloon that contains DNA, which is fed into 
<br>
the artery. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The trick was we coupled that to electroporation,&quot; Goodenow said. 
<br>
<p>In mice, the electroporation opened up muscle cells to deliver the growth 
<br>
factor, which led to new arteries. 
<br>
<p>The catheter platform could be used to deliver everything from gene therapy 
<br>
to topical anesthetics to collagen as an anti-aging treatment, Goodenow said. 
<br>
<p>Some researchers are using different means to get gene therapy into cells. 
<br>
Jonathan Vogel, an investigator in the dermatology branch at the NCI takes skin 
<br>
from a mouse, and subjects it to gene therapy using a viral vector in a dish. 
<br>
<p>He then grafts the skin back onto the mouse. The goal is to get the gene into 
<br>
the bloodstream so it will have a therapeutic effect throughout the body. For 
<br>
example, it could generate a clotting factor for hemophiliacs, or insulin for 
<br>
diabetics. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The cells are used as factories,&quot; Vogel said. 
<br>
<p>Genetronics is collaborating with Genteric to develop a similar systemic 
<br>
method by injecting genes into salivary glands, then electroporating the area so 
<br>
cells will absorb them and carry them through the bloodstream.
