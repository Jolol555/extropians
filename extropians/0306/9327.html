</em><br>
<em>&gt; [I'm] drawing a contrast between what seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a need for you to attack religiosity when overtly expressed as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such (even to the point of dissing a 13 year old kid, which I think was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excessive, and which you seem to be backing off a bit, good for you!),
</em><br>
<p>What is all this &quot;attack religiosity&quot; business?  I mean, religiosity is not
<br>
above reproach, is it?  Maybe I don't mince words (and I like to have fun
<br>
with words - hmmm, I think that was the name of one of my primers from
<br>
childhood, Fun With Words), but, Mike, I'm really a sweetie.  Carl Sagan was
<br>
(had to be) much more diplomatic when he wrote about the issues we've been
<br>
discussing on this thread, and I've admired his clarity and integrity for a
<br>
long time (maybe you'll find his thoughts regarding religiosity more
<br>
palatable, and not as churlish as mine?):
<br>

<br>
<p><em>&gt; yet you have been silent on the writing of Nick Bostrom, whose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulation arguments MANDATE that there be a system operator, i.e. a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'God' to have created this universe if it is indeed a simulation. I'll
</em><br>
<em>&gt; note that you failed to respond to this point in my post. Please do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond now.
</em><br>
<p>I am much more pedestrian than Nick Bostrom.  I am also at a complete loss
<br>
to understand what he means by a &quot;system operator&quot; (i.e., a &quot;God&quot;).  I
<br>
MANDATE that there be proof (or rhyme or reason), and if and when there is
<br>
incontrovertible evidence ... I'll skip my skiff and join you all on the the
<br>
God Ship Lollipop.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; As I've not had any trouble shedding religiosity at a very early
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; age (and I'm no genius),  I was wondering what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people thought.  I've learned some things here (I usually do), and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; appreciate the input from all the posters.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I'll note that you failed to respond to my earlier post making just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that contrast, that Mr Smith IS a supergenius and you are not, so IMHO
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's a bit arrogant for you to think that it was to be assumed that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically knew more than him, in calling him arrogant for thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is a God.
</em><br>
<p>That's not what I meant.  I don't think intelligence has much to do with
<br>
whether a person comes up with the observation:  &quot;There's no reason to think
<br>
there's a supernatural creator (not to mention:  'Which one?'),&quot; v. &quot;Why,
<br>
yes, of course there is a supernatural creator.&quot;  I've read about many
<br>
humans' almost palpable desire to believe in a divine force (due to
<br>
something dubbed &quot;the religion gene&quot;).  Whatever it is - whatever makes
<br>
group A different from group B - this interests me, and remains a mystery to
<br>
me.  I'm very practical - maybe I don't have a very fantastical mind.  Ever
<br>
since reading Russian fairy tales as a child, I've always liked stories
<br>
(these days, in the form of some fiction, movies and the like), but when it
<br>
comes to day-to-day life, I am very practical - a materialist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for myself, I'm enough of a genius to say I don't know the answer. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am genius enough to say that the arguments made by Nick Bostrom are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persuasive that we likely do live in a simulation. If that is so, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the argument that there is a creator 'God' is implicit. Furthermore,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the range of knowledge between what we know and what such a theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God must know to have achieved this simulation is so significant that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we really are in no position to judge any limits on what is and is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible for such a God to do within this simulation.
</em><br>
<p>As a child I remember seeing an episode of The Twilight Zone that first
<br>
introduced me to the idea of living in a simulation - I mean, the screenplay
<br>
was very crude and simple, but I found it intriguing.  But unless and until
<br>
there's good reason to believe any of that, I'm of the parsimonious
<br>
principle school (aka Occam's razor).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thus, if the simulation argument holds, then atheism is dead, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiosity is an acceptable standard for scientific individuals to
</em><br>
practice.
<br>
<p>There's nothing like scientific proof.  And I'll believe it when I see it
<br>
(and - it is hoped - understand it!).
