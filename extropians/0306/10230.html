<p>There are three aspects of this question:
<br>
a) Can you design the molecule?
<br>
b) Can you determine its properties?
<br>
c) Can you actually assemble one of them?
<br>
<p>The answers are probably something like;
<br>
a) Probably not, you cannot design every possible molecule, there are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;just too many possibilities. Drexler (Nanosystems, pg 264) computes
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that the number of possible atomic configurations in even a small
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 nm^3 volume, limiting yourself to only 30 atom times is 10^148.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is a *huge* number.  I'm not sure even an MBrain could touch it.
<br>
b) To determine its properties you (unless you do it from a &quot;theory&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perspective you have to do a molecular simulation.  Molecular
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;simulations EAT computer time because you have to run them at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;something between femtosecond and picosecond time resolution.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also don't think physicists and chemists have a good handle
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on predicting physical properties yet -- quantum dots come to mind.
<br>
c) There will likely be physical chemical (molecular) designs which
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;there is no way to assemble.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This would eleminate the trial and error approach and solve possible
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every disease!
</em><br>
<p>However, &quot;combinatorial chemistry&quot; does work at small scales and does
<br>
generate a *lot* of nanoscale molecules -- many hundreds of thousands to
<br>
perhaps millions of combinations.  And in fact Francis Collins et al (the
<br>
director of NHGRI and associates), in a recent Nature paper discussing
<br>
where does genomic/proteomic research go next actually suggested using
<br>
combinatorial chemistry to pre-screen for molecules that interact with
<br>
defective or maladapted proteins, particularly for rare disease gene
<br>
candidates, to speed up the development of candidates for treating the
<br>
disease.  (So you are thinking along the right lines...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I estimated that there are so many possible chemicals out there in nature
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we could probably never get to a point where we could try them all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on everything.
</em><br>
<p>The phase space of chemicals at the nanoscale is *very* large -- though
<br>
certainly Nature is complex -- it hasn't even begun to touch the
<br>
surface.
<br>
<p>Interesting question though.
