<p><em>&gt; Lee Corbin wrote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I disagree.  There is no tiny kernel of truth.  None of these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; people have ever given any indication of supporting the enemy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, of course by &quot;the enemy&quot; you mean Saddam Hussein.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or the communists, the terrorists, al Quaeda, bin Ladin, the North
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnamese, the 911 hijackers, and the Saudis.  We have been accused of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supporting all of these in the past week.  All without evidence.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pretty extensive, wide-spread, and really bizarre!
</em><br>
<p>Of course.  Thanks for the correction.  But I also surmise that
<br>
by &quot;our&quot; enemy, one is identifying with Western civilization,
<br>
or with a specific collection of Western nations, or with the
<br>
U.S.  Which is it?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; But doesn't it all depend on how you conceive of what your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proper duties are as a citizen?  Is it not also highly parameterized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by circumstances?  I'm sure that you can think of many historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; situations (or simulations) in which sufficient danger would exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or in which sufficient fealty would be the norm, that it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; true that &quot;if you are not with us, then you are against us&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; NO, NO, NO, NO!
</em><br>
<p>Not very uncertain here, I see  ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We cannot require people to express the government's official line
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or be accused of treason for merely failing to express an opinion.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  The mechanism looks simple to me (not that I'm defending it),
<br>
and I am sure you understand it too:  A attacks X.  B attacks A.  The
<br>
conjecture arises naturally that B supports X.  You couldn't be more
<br>
correct when you point out that this is not a logical conclusion.  But
<br>
as Eliezer was saying, it must weigh what one thinks (or suspects) is
<br>
going on.
<br>
<p>In this case C, who conjectures that B supports X, should *ask*
<br>
&quot;why shouldn't an attack on A in these circumstances be regarded
<br>
as support of X?&quot;  You did not respond to my &quot;lip-service&quot; remark.
<br>
I think that perhaps if B every so often paid lip-service by
<br>
denouncing X, the problems would be less severe.  (Perhaps you
<br>
have done this sufficiently enough in your eyes.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is so wrong, I can't imagine people buying into these loyalty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oaths.
</em><br>
<p>Well, this is the sort of leap from one subject (that I
<br>
thought I was talking about) to another that sometimes
<br>
contributes to misunderstanding.  But as you write below,
<br>
I have missed a lot of this thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Not expressing an opinion is not evidence of guilt.  People cannot
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be accused of crimes for NOT doing anything.  People are innocent until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven guilty.  We cannot allow the government to change this to being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guilty until proven innocent.  A lack of evidence is not proof of guilt.  (I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never thought I would have to explain this on the Extropians list....)
</em><br>
<p>Totally agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I readily understand that you cannot take insults lying down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and that you need to defend what &quot;anti-American&quot; would mean to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you (not that you and others have neglected this).  I myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doubt the utility or the wisdom of such provocations---yet if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you could (and I don't know---perhaps you've tried) get those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people to explain more concretely what they mean when they use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such terms, perhaps the disagreements would be loftier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You haven't followed the debate.  The terms are not unclear.  People are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being accused of specific terms with no evidence.  There is no failure on my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part to understand the slander being bandied about here.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I still suspect that the terms *are* unclear.  But it
<br>
doesn't matter: no accusation should be put forth without
<br>
a supporting argument.  The length and detail of the supporting
<br>
argument should be proportional to the seriousness of the charge
<br>
(i.e., the estimated intensity of the denial it will provoke).
<br>
Sadly, such supportive arguments are too seldom seen---but today,
<br>
at any rate, things look better than they did before.
<br>
<p>You will note that I did not mention any failure on your part.
<br>
I'm very worried that in the above paragraph---despite all my
<br>
qualifying words and phrases, it still accused you of some kind
<br>
of failure (my blind).  If so, I guess I'd like to know what.
<br>
But if not, forget it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; What is going on is differing conceptions of what a country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or a nation should be, and the proper amount of allegiance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that is due.  ;-) Your cries of &quot;slander&quot; are just as much an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overreaction as theirs of &quot;war-criminal&quot;, or &quot;traitor&quot;, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps they did start it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Wrong.  When someone is accused of being supportive of communism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism, or the enemy without any evidence, that is slander.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I'm not going to argue about that definition.  Evidently
<br>
you don't see much hope that a softer tone would be salutary.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My complaints are not an overreaction.  Accusations of crimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the state with no evidence is a much larger overreaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than merely defending against those accusations.
