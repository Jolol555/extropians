<p>Here's a foolish question to which the economically-sophisticated might
<br>
care to respond: 
<br>
<p>What happens to the vast hoards of loot misappropriated by those despots,
<br>
corrupt bureaucrats and (at last, a chance to use this word!) their ilk?
<br>
<p>I assume they don't stock their swimming pools with greenbacks and swim in
<br>
money like Unca Scrooge.
<br>
<p>Presumably a lot of it is used on military purchases, which doesn't help
<br>
their own economies develop but must be useful to the Swedes, the Brits,
<br>
the French and other nameless arms manufacturers and dealers. So the wealth
<br>
doesn't *vanish*, a lot of it supports First World manufacturing, and
<br>
presumably our economies (although in a less useful way than if it was
<br>
spent on intelligent matter compilers, but not worse than if it were spent
<br>
on porn and action DVDs, chewing gum, hamburgers, fat fantasy trilogies and
<br>
hair styling).
<br>
<p>Much must be spent on fawning retinues and standing armies or the like,
<br>
which means at least those people are being fed and housed, although at a
<br>
colossal waste of human productive capacity (but maybe also constraining
<br>
the nastier impulses of many people who otherwise would run about setting
<br>
fires and rampaging and killing in an uncontrolled rather than contained
<br>
manner).
<br>
<p>Even if the despots spend a lot of their ill-gotten gains on closets of
<br>
shoes and tasteless bedroom art and whores, you hit a limit on that kind of
<br>
expenditure fairly quickly, I imagine.
<br>
<p>On humanitarian grounds, it's obviously offensive that any of it at all is
<br>
spent on stocking and running torture chambers, spy networks, etc. But
<br>
that's a different topic, I think.
<br>
<p>I'm rambling, sorry. Anyone have anything definitive to add to this?
<br>
