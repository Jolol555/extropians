<p>
I'm surprised that I haven't seen the real truth about the market and
<br>
trading strategy exposed yet ... let me throw it out there ...
<br>
<p>Playing the market is pretty straightforward.  Forget all that fancy
<br>
schmancy analysis and clever algorithmic prediction nonsense.  As gts
<br>
says, trading systems that claim to validate themselves on hindsight are
<br>
cute, but are still 50/50 chances (or worse for you) on making money.
<br>
<p>The market is driven by the simplest of principle -- supply and demand.
<br>
The supply is known and limited ... so demand is what sets the price.
<br>
So, how do you profit in the market?  Try to guess where the demand is
<br>
going to be.  What's great is in order to profit, you don't have to be
<br>
the /first/ to know where the demand is headed.  You just have to not be
<br>
the /last/ one to find out where it went.
<br>
<p>Now, all those analysts will tell you that the hard work and brainpower
<br>
expended in analysis is all about determining where the demand is
<br>
headed.  Fact of the matter is, the market is a beauty pageant.  It's
<br>
subjective, because demand is the result of the subjective choices of
<br>
some key players.  In other words: the most beautiful girl at the
<br>
pageant isn't necessarily the most beautiful.  She's just the one that
<br>
all the /judges/ agree is the most beautiful by the way they voted.
<br>
<p>So, IMHO, a good strategy is to try and identify at the current time who
<br>
the &quot;judges&quot; in the market are, try to understand their strategy
<br>
(irrelevant of if you think their strategy is good or bad) and try and
<br>
simply predict where they're headed.  Or, don't even do that much:
<br>
simply watch them and follow them and hope you're not the last one in
<br>
line, and you should profit -- the earlier you get in line, the more
<br>
you'll profit.
