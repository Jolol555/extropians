<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, Sharon is just one example where religious motivation is surely not a primary force. On the other hand, people who take up Islamist causes, however, or at least their rhetoric; rate a cosmic double-whammy in my rating.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, there is little evidence that atheism, is any more peaceful, then relgiousity.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;***Atheism is not a philosophy (such as secular humanism), and it's not a political party.  While communism was supposedly atheistic (and, again, atheism was not the primary focus of communism, but a component), the religious/monarchist cultural model (at least in Russia) never really dissipated.  Supposedly, when there was no longer any reason to be prejudiced against Jews (even secular Jews) in the USSR, Jews (primarily) were relegated to a different &quot;class&quot;.  The cultural baggage just couldn't be shaken.  Religion (and its divisive ways) never left entirely, in other words.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;The same sort of nonsense is going on in Israel.  It claims to be a democracy, but it seems to be influenced by its Old Testament biblical roots (ancient prejudices, privileges and all).  How does anyone claim real estate (Israel) after 2000+ years?  (A line from Exodus-the-song comes to mind:  &quot;This Land is mine, God gave this Land to me&quot; - I realize it is only a song - and the words, not the song, were written by non other than the esteemed *Pat Boone,* I believe - but that seems to be the sentiment, as well)  By this line of reasoning (the reclamation of real estate after thousands of years have passed), we need to give the U.S.A. back to the Native Americans.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;It's an interesting aside is that people who are unchurched (or unsynaguogued or unmosqued) are way under-represented in jails.  It seems those free from religion are better citizens.
