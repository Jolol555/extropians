<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hey, all of you silent extropians, did you hear that? Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;                                    IRAQ WAR WAS EXTROPIAN
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I would love to hear a statement from those celebrities who came up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the idea of extropianism a while ago. Maybe a voice or two from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; board of directors? Just to make sure if this is a general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion, just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand why main contributors to the ideas of the movement like Eugen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Leitl withdrew from this list...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If you want a voice from the board of directors, refer to Greg Burchs post
<br>
in which he outlined the reasons why he felt this war was extropic.   While
<br>
Greg does not speak for the whole board, I would be interested in seeing the
<br>
boards official opinion on the war, if they feel it necessary to form and
<br>
officialize one.
<br>
<p>If the board wants to ban political discussions, thats fine, but if you are
<br>
implying that people like Eugen Leitl withdrew from the list because of my
<br>
posts, he should have just put me in his Kill File.  As I said before on
<br>
this particular point, I refuse to be held responsible for other peoples
<br>
actions.  If you accuse me of dishonest debate, please present evidence that
<br>
I have acted dishonestly, otherwise merely partaking in political
<br>
discussions is not justifaction for blaiming me for Eugen Leitl loss.
<br>
<p>I will pose a question to you, which so many others refuse to answer.
<br>
<p>Does anyone have a right to be a dictator?
<br>
<p>I suspect you, just as everyone else, will simply refuse to answer this
<br>
question, you will refuse because it would force you to acknowledge that
<br>
Saddam had no right to be a dictator and that he is morally culpable for
<br>
every death that resulted from the coalitions efforts and not the coalition,
<br>
which it seems, above all else, must be wrong.
<br>
<p>Even if you felt the motivations going into the war were not justified, that
<br>
STILL does NOT give Saddam any right to be a dictator.
<br>
<p>If the extropy board (board of directors) takes on official stance on the
<br>
War, I want to see them take an official stance on rights of a dictator
<br>
question.
<br>
<p>As for the reasons this War was Extropic, as I said Greg Burch posted
<br>
reasons he felt it was, additionaly, both Robert Bradbury and Lee Corbin
<br>
have posted reasons why this war could be considered extropic and just, as
<br>
have I.  I will not, however, repost it because I doubt you will be
<br>
interested in reasonably debating each point, since you have never showed
<br>
any inclination to do so in the past.  If you do feel inclined to discuss
<br>
each point and its relatively extropic value, just respond as much and I
<br>
will be happy to oblige.
<br>
<p>I will repeat a paragraph I posted to you previously.
<br>
<p>There are many other reasons to support the effort to remove Saddam Hussain
<br>
from power, but unless you address and/or invalidate these points (or
<br>
whatever other ones other supporters have) you will not change any ones
<br>
minds.  So I guess it boils down to what your goal is, reminding everyone
<br>
that you dont like the war, or trying to change other peoples minds about
<br>
it.  We know you dont like the war, so dispense with your creative efforts
<br>
at saying as much, and just post 'I dont like the war'  Pointing out to
<br>
supporters the dismay that the Iraqi people undergo dissuades no supports
<br>
because they believe, legitametely, that more suffering will be caused by
<br>
inaction than by action.
