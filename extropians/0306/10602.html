following up on a topic from last August 2002
<br>
<p><p>The Economist 7 June 2003
<br>
<p>Sticky tape
<br>
Echoes of geckos
<br>
<p>A new adhesive tape works like a lizard's foot
<br>
<p>Engineers frequently admire the ways in which living creatures solve
<br>
problems. However they rarely manage to emulate them. But Andrey Geim
<br>
from Manchester University, in England, and his colleagues have done
<br>
so. In a paper just published in Nature Materials, they describe how
<br>
they replicated the way that geckos cling to ceilings in a new
<br>
glue-free adhesive tape.
<br>
<p>A gecko's powers come from tiny hairs on the soles of its feet. Each
<br>
hair sticks to any surface it touches by a combination of capillary
<br>
action due to water it has absorbed and so-called van der Waals
<br>
forces - electrostatic interactions between individual molecules.
<br>
Though the attraction between a hair and a surface is tiny, geckos
<br>
have zillions of such hairs, and the sum of the interactions is
<br>
enough to hold a lizard to the ceiling.
<br>
<p>Dr. Geim and his colleagues used electron-beam lithography (a
<br>
technique employed in the manufacture of computer chips) to
<br>
fabricate small pieces of plastic tape that had hairlike
<br>
protuberances on their surfaces. They created a range of surfaces
<br>
with hairs measuring between a fifth of a micron (millionth of a
<br>
metre) and four microns in diameter, and with around 100m hairs per
<br>
square centimetre. Dr. Geim reckons that a person wearing gloves
<br>
made from the tape could stick to a wall as well as a gecko does. He
<br>
has not yet done that experiment, though, for the pieces of tape
<br>
that the team has produced so far are only a square centimetre in
<br>
area.
<br>
<p>There is still some way to go before gecko tape becomes a commercial
<br>
reality. The prototype is delicate stuff, losing its adhesive powers
<br>
after three or four uses. And electron-beam lithography does not
<br>
lend itself to mass production. But if it could be made cheaply,
<br>
geckotape would have many uses. Move over Spiderman, Geckoman is on
<br>
his way.
