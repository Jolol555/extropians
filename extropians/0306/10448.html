In a message dated 6/17/2003 1:48:41 PM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:alex@ramonsky.com?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!%20%20(personal%20revelation)">alex@ramonsky.com</a> writes: There are a lot of very clever people on this list. By 'clever' I 
<br>
mean they know a lot of facts, are competent in maths and the sciences, take 
<br>
an interest in world (or at least US) affairs, and are very very good at the 
<br>
sort of skills that enable us to pass IQ tests.
<br>
<p>Alex,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me back away from your position just a little to recall what 
<br>
Herrnstein and Serebriakoff said that seems to me to be applicable to this list and 
<br>
the heat that is generated here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Herrnstein claims there is evidence that since about 1900 AD the 
<br>
clever Hi IQ types have slowly been coming into community.  I think Mensa, the 
<br>
Extropian list and lots of other evidence is indicative that Herrnstein was 
<br>
correct.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, Victor Serebriakoff was saying back in the 60s that when a 
<br>
bunch of Hi IQ types get together they behave badly.  They are not used to being 
<br>
around those as clever as themselves and behave badly when they can't dominate 
<br>
anyone with their intellectual agility.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given what we observe on the list why shouldn't I assume that 
<br>
Serebriakoff and Herrnstein are correct?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give a minor example: we have a thread called &quot;Dishonest debate 
<br>
(was Cluster Bombs)&quot;  I haven't looked up the origins of that thread name but 
<br>
I will bet you that the guy or gal that changed that name didn't do it to 
<br>
warn us of his dishonest tactics.  In fact I will hazard a guess that he or she 
<br>
was involved in the debate called &quot;cluster bombs&quot; and changed the name while he 
<br>
was losing the debate called &quot;cluster bombs.&quot;  I'll let you look it up and 
<br>
you can be the judge, Alex.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my view the arguments and the dishonest manipulation of threads 
<br>
through name changes serves the Serebriakoff purpose.  Immature people are being 
<br>
given an opporturnity to vent their spleen and learn how to behave in polite 
<br>
society.  Alex, I'll let you be the judge of that also -- think about it for 
<br>
awhile and watch.
<br>
Ron h.
<br>
<p>No, I don't know who made that change, hope it wasn't me.  &lt;G&gt;
