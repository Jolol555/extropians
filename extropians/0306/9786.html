<em>&gt;James,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        I think that was probably meant to express your emotions more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt;your intellect or any evidence you might have.
</em><br>
<p><p><em>&gt;Instead you want to make it sound as if we have deeply offended you on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some deep level and that the evidence we have found is non existent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Heck after more than fifty years your people can't even tell the truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about Israel nor admit they have a right to live except at your mercy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>It was meant to express pretty much what I stated, that I wasn't going to 
<br>
get into the discussions and accusations of what &quot;you want to make it sound 
<br>
as if&quot; and &quot;your people can't&quot;.  Since I don't know your good self or Mez 
<br>
(or either of your families) personally, I'm not qualified to make comments 
<br>
regarding what your or his &quot;people&quot; are doing or not doing.  I didn't see 
<br>
the relevance of it to the discussion, except as an emotive statement.  As 
<br>
such, I felt it at very least sidetracking, if not overly personal towards 
<br>
Mez, so I didn't want to add fuel to any fire that might erupt.
<br>
<p>I'm not clear as to where the &quot;emotion&quot; bit comes into it on my part, 
<br>
though.  Or the &quot;evidence&quot; bit, either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   If you ever straighten it out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;into a coherent piece, I will answer it -- easily.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ron h
</em><br>
<p>I'd guess that most people understood what I was talking about.  If anyone 
<br>
(besides Ron) didn't, I hope the above serves as adequate clarification.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p><p>James...
