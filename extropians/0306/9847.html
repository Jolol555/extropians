<p>It sure as hell is.  The number I'm more familiar with is ~$70 billion.
<br>
But that is still a hell of a lot of money unless it ends up getting
<br>
paid for by Iraqi oil.  With 112+ billion barrels in reserves, even
<br>
at a very low price of $10/barrel they could easily afford it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given the choice, what would you rank as the most extropic way to expend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; US$200 billion?
</em><br>
<p>It depends in part whether one wants to optimize short term life
<br>
extension or long term life extension.
<br>
<p>Aubrey de Grey's &quot;Institute of Biomedical Gerontology&quot; which might
<br>
make a significant dent in aging I believe requires ~$100M over
<br>
10 years (= ~$1B).  So it is a drop in the bucket compared with
<br>
the Iraqi situation.  Yet funding for the NIH has approximately
<br>
doubled over the last 5-7 years so it may be difficult to see
<br>
how that might be increased substantially in the near future.
<br>
<p>Given the post 911 realities the U.S. population is willing to
<br>
spend big on defense.  Now whether that is spent wisely is a very
<br>
complex question.  The fact that the U.S. military is now able
<br>
to largely get out of Saudi Arabia would seem to be good.  But
<br>
leaving civilians as the primary Al Queda targets there leaves
<br>
many questions.
<br>
<p>But expenses there will tend to be a drop in the bucket.
<br>
<p>I would guess that significant programs to deal with the
<br>
HIV/AIDS crisis in Africa would probably come near the top
<br>
of my list and the U.S. appears to be doing that.
<br>
<p>After HIV/AIDS and aging, one needs to solve world hunger
<br>
and that gets into some very complex issues (farm subsidies,
<br>
etc.)  In the longer term there are a host of environmental
<br>
issues that are in turn tied to population issues that need
<br>
to be dealt with.
