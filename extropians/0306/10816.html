<br>
<p><em>    &gt; The &quot;forcing&quot; of labels
</em><br>
<p>Why the quotation marks? You're saying if I sell a can of peas with a label
<br>
you don't like you will put me in jail, that sounds like forcing to me.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;is to prevent a bigger, messier sequence of  events: companies selling
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;foods without labels,
</em><br>
<p>It's really not that complicated, if you don't like food without labels then
<br>
don't buy food without labels.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;people (as it was  suggested) setting up labs for analyzing food and
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;publishing reports
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with that?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; companies suing those labs for misleading information,
</em><br>
<p>What's wrong with that? Fraud should be punished and I don't see why
<br>
mandatory labeling laws will lead to less fraud or fewer lawsuits.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;special interest  groups lobbying for this and that,
</em><br>
<p>In government special interest  groups will always be lobbying for this and
<br>
that, and the more an industry is regulated the more lobbying there will be.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;and consumers that do not know what to do.
</em><br>
<p>Consumers will know to buy food that has a label they like from a company
<br>
they trust. That trust is a valuable commodity and something no company
<br>
would not want to jeopardize.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; It's something like the lesser of evils. Complete, in-depth labels
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; would not only settle the GM arguments, but also provide benefits in
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;other  ways,
</em><br>
<p>And would one of those &quot;other ways&quot; be the astrological sign of the person
<br>
who grew the food along with the GM information? After all, millions of
<br>
people are interested in astrology, far more than in modern genetics, you
<br>
don't see many molecular biology columns in the tabloids but every one of
<br>
them will tell you what will happen when the house of Mars is in Uranus.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Forget GM, if people are worried about the food supply they should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;demonstrate against the huge amount of antibiotics injected into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;millions of cows and chickens that helps bacteria develop resistance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;those drugs; and also complain about the unsanitary and unusual culinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;practices in China that gave us SARS and many varieties of influenza.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;There is little doubt those two things have killed people, lots and lots
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;of people, GM food almost certainly never hurt anybody.
</em><br>
<p><em>     &gt; I agree, but those are independent issues. Protesting one does not
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;mean accepting another one.
</em><br>
<p>Protesting something that has never hurt anyone is time and effort spent
<br>
that could have been used to save many thousands, it's a classic case of
<br>
misplaced priorities.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Some years ago, Europe was shocked by the &quot;mad cow&quot; disease.
</em><br>
<p>And mad cow disease had nothing to due with GM foods.
