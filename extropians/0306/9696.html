Harvey Newstrom replied to me:
<br>
<p><a href="mailto:MaxPlumm@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20[WAR]%20amazing%20new%20photo%20history">MaxPlumm@aol.com</a> wrote,
<br>
<em>&gt; If you had taken a moment to step off the Condescension Express, Mr.
</em><br>
Newstrom,
<br>
<em>&gt; you might have noticed that I never once mentioned President Bush in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original reply to Damien.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;That's just plain misleading.  While it is true you didn't mention
<br>
President Bush by name, you clearly criticized Damien's concern with
<br>
&quot;American missteps&quot; and suggested he research &quot;the Saddam Hussein regime&quot;
<br>
instead.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
No, it is you who again are being just &quot;plain misleading&quot;. On the first 
<br>
point, by &quot;American missteps&quot;, I referred to civilian casualties inflicted by 
<br>
Coalition forces in the field, given those would be the dead bodies Damien sought 
<br>
to have included in the photo history. In regard to your assertion that I 
<br>
suggested he ignore those deaths, let us refer back to my original post to Damien: 
<br>
<p>Then no doubt you are currently at work preparing in your view a more 
<br>
appropriate pictorial compendium of the just concluded war in Iraq. One would hate to 
<br>
think you are merely concerned with American missteps, however, so no doubt 
<br>
you are ALSO (emphasis added) preparing a pictorial compendium of the Saddam 
<br>
Hussein regime and its legacy. You'll find no shortage of dead children there.
<br>
<p>I certainly did criticize Damien's concern with &quot;American missteps&quot;, but only 
<br>
because he showed a single-minded concern for what the West did wrong and 
<br>
ignored the innocent victims murdered by the Hussein regime. The context in which 
<br>
I mentioned the other evil regimes was, as I said earlier, heavily sarcastic, 
<br>
but I was and remain appalled that he is more concerned with the plight of 
<br>
American pot smokers than the victims in Pyongyang, Hanoi, or Havana's gulags. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have never read a post of Damien's in which he refers to a Vietnamese
</em><br>
Communist
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;re-education camp omelette&quot;, a Castro or Mengistu's &quot;famine omelette&quot;,
</em><br>
or even
<br>
<em>&gt; a Saddam Hussein's &quot;oily omelette&quot;. The crude criticism is reserved
</em><br>
solely for
<br>
<em>&gt; the Bush administration.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The current thread is about the Iraq war.  It is unfair to attack Damien
<br>
for not criticizing other regimes that are not involved.&quot;
<br>
<p>Last time I checked, Saddam Hussein's regime was (albeit briefly) involved in 
<br>
the Iraq war. In regards to the other odious regimes, they merely serve to 
<br>
illustrate the fact that Damien somehow approves of a world and moral view in 
<br>
which a despot may deliberately murder or destroy hundreds of thousands to 
<br>
millions of people, but the West may not inadvertently kill hundreds to remove said 
<br>
despot. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So clearly your analysis that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my thinking consists of Bush=good, arrogant extropians=evil is clearly
</em><br>
incorrect.
<br>
<em>&gt; If anyone is guilty of oversimplification in this instance, it is clearly
</em><br>
you.
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't think so.  The more you rail against communists in other regimes
<br>
instead of discussing Iraq, the more I think you are using binary thinking
<br>
of &quot;us-versus-them&quot; to lump all of &quot;them&quot; together.&quot;
<br>
<p>Please illuminate for those of us not occupying your higher plain of logic 
<br>
and reasoning specifically why it is inappropriate, or an &quot;oversimplification&quot; 
<br>
to list the Saddam Hussein regime amongst a &quot;them&quot; list of similar murderous 
<br>
and barbaric tyrants ranging from Hitler to Mengistu Haile Mariam.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since it is apparent you are more than willing to share your ever cogent
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; not the slightest bit pretentious insights with us, Mr. Newstrom, I
</em><br>
humbly
<br>
<em>&gt; request that you tell me how my &quot;position&quot; as an anti-communist (indeed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone's favorite at that) is so flawed.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This is the oversimplification I am talking about.  Where in the world did
<br>
you get the idea that I thought your anti-communist position was flawed?&quot;
<br>
<p>Hmm, let us return to your original post to me:
<br>
<p>&quot;I also noted that the previous note somehow was connected with
<br>
anti-communism AND (emphasis added) several other binary us vs. them 
<br>
worldviews.&quot;
<br>
<p>You directly state that anti-communism is a subset of binary &quot;us vs them&quot;
<br>
worldviews.  You then commented on your perceived value of binary world views 
<br>
thusly:
<br>
<p>&quot;Strange.  It's like some people see reality in black and white, while
<br>
others see whole continuums of grey and colors.&quot;
<br>
<p>Given these concise observations, one must draw the conclusion that you 
<br>
consider binary worldviews flawed, or incorrect.  Since you directly assert that 
<br>
anti-communism is a binary worldview, the negative implications of your comments 
<br>
are obvious. So, you must then either directly acknowledge that my position 
<br>
as an anti-communist is not flawed, or conversely you must define why it is 
<br>
flawed, which despite a clear enunciation of why I hold such a &quot;binary worldview&quot; 
<br>
in my previous post to you, you chose not to address it in this post.
<br>
<p>Regards from a country without &quot;Democratic&quot; in its name,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
