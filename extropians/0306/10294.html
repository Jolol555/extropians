<em>&gt;&gt;and WARPING of intellect necessary to distort one's probabilities THAT FAR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;away from the simple COMMON SENSE that NOBODY on the Extropians mailing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;list is likely to support Hussein!  What is going on here cannot possibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be Bayesian reasoning.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alas, your extremely strong wording is only symptomatic
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Do not worry.  No irrationality is occurring.  I am simply becoming 
<br>
Annoyed.  This is an ordinary state for an Eliezer to be in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;That's not what's going on.  Foaming tribalist fanatics such as are now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;appearing on this mailing list - there is no point in mincing words
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh yes there is!  Your so-called &quot;mincing words&quot; is extremely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effective flame retardant.  Who're you calling a &quot;foaming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tribalist fanatic&quot;?  We absolutely must lower the level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rhetoric here.
</em><br>
<p>Hm.  Well, that's one approach to life, I suppose.  I've never ever been 
<br>
able to master it, and I've tried.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;- are not attempting to use &quot;Bayesian reasoning&quot; or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&quot;rationality&quot;; they are acting on blind instinct and pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;emotion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pure emotion?  Isn't this the second time today I've caught
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you in gross exaggeration?  What is happening to you, Eliezer?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can't you try for a little detachment here?  You're making
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it so black and white.
</em><br>
<p>Please do not confuse my searing flame of annoyance with group 
<br>
polarization.  Quite often I become equally searingly annoyed with both 
<br>
sides of a particularly stupid fight.
<br>
<p>Now of course my annoyance may well be a personal flaw.  I have often 
<br>
considered that.  I don't seem to be able to get rid of it, though; and it 
<br>
would be very very dangerous to stop being annoyed with my own flaws. 
<br>
Like it or not, becoming annoyed at things seems to be a part of my basic 
<br>
nature and motivations.  Whether I like it or not, I am, by my nature, 
<br>
rational, fair, altruistic, tactless, sharp, acerbic, biting, and easily 
<br>
annoyed even at people who are honestly trying to improve.  I try and work 
<br>
with it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;anyone who does not support Bush must support Hussein, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;when this conclusion runs in total defiance of simple common 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;sense about the prior odds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are correct.  Anyone committing that fallacy needs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be criticized, *individually*.  Are you attempting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to characterize with these remarks all those who value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patriotism here?
</em><br>
<p>I don't know.  Are there any sensible people who value patriotism here, 
<br>
who consider themselves patriots but have been staying out of the current 
<br>
flamingly stupid debate?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;That is how human tribalist thinking works.  One need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;only pick up a history book to see this.  I do not need
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;to invent more elaborate explanations for this behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Tribal polarization is a human universal and it is quite,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;quite stupid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree with your sweeping conclusion.  Moreover, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think your choice of words very imprudent, especially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the last one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;I will *not* pay lip-service to it.  That ugly part
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;of human nature is *my* enemy.
</em><br>
<p>I consider it okay to have inanimate enemies; death, human nature, 
<br>
evolution, stupidity, etc.
