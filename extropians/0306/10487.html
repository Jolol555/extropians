</em><br>
<p>That is correct; it seems uncontroversial that the majority of humanity 
<br>
doesn't know what's coming down the line.  Of course, neither may we, but 
<br>
that would only seem to bolster the point about rationality; if the future 
<br>
is not as strange as we imagine it will probably be stranger.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are many things that I do not like about academia, but on this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point I have internalized the academic priority given to intellectual 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modularity.  In academia, different people work on different topics, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hope to combine their results later.  When discussing each topic, one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tries to minimize the dependencies of results in this area to results in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other areas.  Of course there will have to be some dependencies, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoiding unnecessary dependencies allows more rapid progress, just as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modularity aids the design of most systems.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is a standard position in some area, and a contrarian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative position in that area, and you are doing work in some other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; area which depends on this first area, your first priority is to say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the standard position would imply for your research, and only after 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having done that may you turn to seeing what the alternative position 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would imply.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am trying to make our discussion of &quot;why believe in truth&quot; be modular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with respect to the very contrarian position that our goals are very 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different from what evolution has given us, or that the world will soon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be very different from what evolution has adapted to.  The fact that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I might happen to agree with this contrarian position is besides the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point.  My first priority is to make our conversation be accessible and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant to the majority who do not share this contrarian position.
</em><br>
<p>Deliberately strive for modularity?  In a consilient universe?
<br>
<p>There is only ever one explanation.  In it, all the pieces fit together 
<br>
perfectly, without strain.  Any divisions in that explanation are 
<br>
artificial - human biases.  I would not take it as a good sign if my 
<br>
theories about one part of cognitive science were consonant with many 
<br>
possible alternatives elsewhere; it would be a sign that the theory was 
<br>
inadequately constrained by the evidence.  I certainly wouldn't 
<br>
deliberately alter the theory to make it consistent with more than one 
<br>
alternative elsewhere.  Nature doesn't work that way in constructing 
<br>
explanations; how could it be a good method for discovering them?  Your 
<br>
first priority should be to discover what the real answer is about the 
<br>
usefulness of rationality.  When you know the real answer, then worry 
<br>
about how to explain it - constructing an accessible explanation.  How can 
<br>
you do both at the same time without biasing your conclusions?  And if 
<br>
your conclusion is wrong, what can you expect but that it will be 
<br>
difficult to explain, being not consonant with many other facts, as truths 
<br>
are?
<br>
<p>This is one of the reasons why I am not an academic...
