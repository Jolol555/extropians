<p>
The Doomsday Argument is silly.  I don't understand how it can be considered
<br>
a valid use of statistics in the first place.  To get an accurate estimate,
<br>
we must pull a random sample from the entire population pool.  In the case
<br>
of the Doomsday Argument, which purports to do statistical analysis on all
<br>
populations past and future, we would need to pull random samples from all
<br>
time periods including past and future.  Any sampling which does not pull
<br>
examples from the future is incomplete and will skew the measurement toward
<br>
our current time.
<br>
<p>Future civilizations are not represented in our random sampling.  By
<br>
sampling at this current point in time, we are excluding future
<br>
civilizations.  Therefore, there is nothing unusual about the fact that our
<br>
numbers are skewed toward the present time, or that future populations are
<br>
not represented in our statistics.  It is circular logic to pull a random
<br>
sample that excludes the future and then turn around and note that the
<br>
future is not represented in the data.
<br>
<p>We can demonstrate the validity of my argument by looking in the past.  It
<br>
is argued that the Doomsday Argument is valid for all period in the past,
<br>
even though it turned out to be wrong.  I submit that it was never valid.
<br>
Looking backwards, we can randomly sample people from the ancient caveman's
<br>
past and future.  In doing so, we do not find an over-represented number of
<br>
people in the past.  The numbers keep expanding into the caveman's future.
<br>
Looking backwards, we can see the true results and the fact that the
<br>
Doomsday Argument failed to accurately measure it.  Thus, as a tool, it has
<br>
continuously failed.  It has never been successful as a predictive tool.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, we can build a simulation of our future civilization and
<br>
measure it.  Even in a civilization that expands forever, we find that the
<br>
Doomsday Argument incorrectly samples its own time period and fails to
<br>
predict the future.  We can see in the simulation that it would always fail
<br>
to produce the correct data.  It does not matter if we simulate doomsday
<br>
scenarios or immortal scenarios, the Doomsday Argument does not and cannot
<br>
change.  It is a broken meter that is not measuring anything about the
<br>
future.
