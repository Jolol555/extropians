<p>Hmmm. On the carrier I was on there was no hotbunking with a complement of 5K 
<br>
men (Kitty hawk, built in the 60s).  But it is possible there was hotbunking  
<br>
in an earlier carrier.  Yes, the compartments often had as many as 100 people 
<br>
in them, and the beds were stacked 3 deep.                                    
<br>
<p>As far as the viability of such a scheme...with extropian type people? YIKES! 
<br>
THat would be a disaster.  We are not all that sociable. I myself had a       
<br>
helluva time being confined that way with so many people. THe ones who        
<br>
actually like it are very sociable people.                                    
<br>
<p><p>My original estimate was obviously somewhat off the cuff. The carrier would
<br>
obviously have no need of so much flight support equipment or manpower. Didn't
<br>
know what the original compliment was, my statement was shooting in the dark.
<br>
<p>If we cut manpower to 500, then single bunk cabins should be de rigeur. If
<br>
we can eliminate lots of unneeded military and flight ops equipment, then
<br>
cabin size would increase significantly. At 500, buy in would average at
<br>
$20k. Smaller cabins could be let to those wishing to make lots of sweat
<br>
equity contributions (i.e. chipping and painting, etc).
<br>
<p>Then lets imagine a fraction of cabins would be let as time-shares by the
<br>
month. $2k per month buy-in is a fantastic time-share rate.
<br>
<p>Then we have to deal with operational costs. This obviously depends on the
<br>
sort of propulsion that would be used. Current installation would be fuel
<br>
hungry. One idea I have is that with that big flat deck, we could install a
<br>
number of scrap airliner wings vertically on pivoting masts. and make it a
<br>
sailing ship... Extropian Windjammer Cruises, anyone?
