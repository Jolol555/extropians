Jeff Davis offers a quotation:
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;...if I thought myself prejudiced against the Jew, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should hold it fairest to leave this subject to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person not crippled in that way. But I think I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such prejudice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no special regard for Satan; but, I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at least claim that I have no prejudice against him.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It may even be that I lean a little his way, on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; account of his not having a fair show.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A person who has for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untold centuries maintained the imposing position of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spiritual head of four-fifths of the human race, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political head of the whole of it, must be granted the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possession of executive abilities of the loftiest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; order.
</em><br>
<p>I haven't read this quote, but from the content and style it is clearly
<br>
Samuel Clemens, aka Mark Twain.  Clemens' nonfiction writings are
<br>
marvelously refreshing in their unmitigated cynicism.  Another delightful
<br>
curmudgeon of the same era is HL Mencken.
<br>
<p>Twain does of course depart from his claimed impartiality in the quote
<br>
Jeff offered, in a surprisingly timely comment:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All religions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; issue bibles against him, and say the most injurious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things about him, but we never hear his side. We have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; none but the evidence for the prosecution, and yet we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have rendered the verdict. To my mind, this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irregular. It is un-English; it is un-American; it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; French.
</em><br>
<p>I'm surprised the Bush administration didn't dust off this quote for
<br>
their anti-France rhetoric.  OTOH the fact that it is used in the context
<br>
of defending Satan was probably disqualifying.
<br>
<p>Hal
