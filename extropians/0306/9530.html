<p>If you use your brain to acquire information before it is reported to the
<br>
newspapers, and act on that information, then that action can be considered
<br>
insider trading. In effect it is legal only for you to be an average
<br>
investor with average knowledge. If you do your homework too well and don't
<br>
share it with everyone else then you go to prison. Superior knowledge is a
<br>
crime.
<br>
<p>Let us say that Martha Stewart is a genius who wrote some kind of amazing
<br>
crystal ball AI software capable of predicting the future of the business
<br>
world with perfect accuracy.  One morning she fires up her AI software and
<br>
sees that the ImClone drug is not going to be approved. Martha then sells
<br>
her shares to protect herself. 
<br>
<p>Her actions and their ramifications under this scenario above would have
<br>
been no different from what they were under the actual real-world scenario.
<br>
The world look exactly the same today if Martha had acted according to her
<br>
AI software rather than on so-called inside information. The same number of
<br>
people would have lost the same number of dollars in ImClone stock. But
<br>
Martha would not now be facing criminal charges.
<br>
<p>If the world would look exactly the same under that hypothetical AI scenario
<br>
compared to the real-life scenario, then where is the justification for the
<br>
criminal charge? Why would we say there are &quot;victims&quot; to Martha's &quot;crime&quot; in
<br>
one scenario but not in the other, when the end results of both scenarios
<br>
are identical in every respect?
