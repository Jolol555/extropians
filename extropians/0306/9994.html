<br>
<p><em>    &gt; You could start by fixing the stuff 9/11 was about.
</em><br>
<p>Religious idiocy?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; US support for Israel (financial, military) and how that relates to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Palestinians.
</em><br>
<p>Most of the hijackers were not Palestinians nor were they poor, and most
<br>
Indonesian Moslems hate America as much as the Arabs do and they've
<br>
never seen a Palestinian in their life.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Occupation of Saudia Arabia
</em><br>
<p>America was there at the request of the Saudi Arabia government to prevent a
<br>
invasion, and now that Saddam is no longer a threat they are leaving. Not
<br>
the sort of behavior you'd expect from a conquering power.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Removing any policies in place that purposefully destabilize the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;region
</em><br>
<p>Destabilize? Before 911 the American policy was always to preserve the
<br>
Status Quo, things are different now and that frightens many in the Mid East
<br>
and that's a good thing. Be afraid, be very afraid.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; so you can get your oil cheaper.
</em><br>
<p>Well, if you can think of a policy that leads to cheaper oil I'm all for it.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Don't mind &quot;fundamentalist&quot; or religious based political groups if and
</em><br>
<em> &gt; when they gain power so long as  they are *democratically* elected.
</em><br>
<p>I don't give a damn if their democratically elected or not, if 51% want to
<br>
kill the other 49% then they have lost all moral authority in my book and if
<br>
they want to kill us (and some do) then I have even less respect for them
<br>
and will do my best to kill them first. By the way Hitler gained power
<br>
legally too, not that I care.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;Just because western mentality espouses separation of church and state
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; as a *THEORY* does not mean everyone else DOES or SHOULD.
</em><br>
<p>All I can say is if they want my respect they'll have separation of church
<br>
and state.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;As I recall,  the muslim caliphs did well under an  Islamic
</em><br>
<em>     &gt;government.
</em><br>
<p>You recall that do you? Well then you must be very old indeed because
<br>
Islamic civilization has gone straight downhill for 800 years due to an
<br>
uninterrupted line of incredibly incompetent governments. They were great
<br>
once but that was a very long time ago.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; stop insulting the prophet mohamed
</em><br>
<p>Why? Clearly he was an asshole.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I have yet to see a single muslim proclaim loudly,  &quot;Jesus was a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; goat-buggering RAPIST!&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Too bad, because Jesus was an asshole too.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;freedom of religion is gauranteed under the koran
</em><br>
<p>Well now you're just being silly.
