<p>Agreed.

<p><em>&gt; Oil is an easy source of energy and carbon compounds,

</em><br>
<p>I've got an economical solution, but one that I am starting
<br>
to believe will not be developed until the &quot;crisis&quot; develops
<br>
(something Simmons talks about).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My prediction is that oil will run out but energy prices remain
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>There is no question that the world has enough coal or nuclear
<br>
energy to last for hundreds of years (at current growth rates).
<br>
The question is whether that energy will be available when it
<br>
is needed?  My home requires natural gas for both heat and hot
<br>
water.  If the natural gas supply goes kaputsky I'm going to
<br>
be very unhappy and have to dedicate resources to investing
<br>
in electric water and home heaters.  The same could be said
<br>
for my cars -- if gasoline becomes an obsolete fuel then my
<br>
cars that require it are likely to be devalued.
<br>
<p>When I discuss &quot;hitting the wall&quot; it applies to the fact that
<br>
in the U.S. everyone is effectively &quot;plugged in&quot;, to either
<br>
their electricity supplier, their natural gas supplier, their
<br>
oil supplier, their gasoline supplier, etc.  A significant
<br>
disruption in this structure is going to hit very hard on
<br>
any economy.  E.g. Where is Japan going to be without oil?
<br>
Where is Russia going to be without natural gas? [For those
<br>
that don't know Moscow is essentially centrally heated
<br>
by hot water produced at a limited number of power plants.
<br>
I would presume those power plants are in turn dependent
<br>
on cheap natural gas supplies.  If the Europeans are willing
<br>
to pay high market prices for natural gas (most of which
<br>
comes from Russia), where does that leave the Russians???]
<br>
<p>I'm not worried that things will eventually balance out --
<br>
I'm worried that the short term disruptions may be very
<br>
significant (and may slow developments).
<br>
