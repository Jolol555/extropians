<p>
Time and again during my 5 tours in SEA I watched while our military was denied
<br>
the right to fight the war as all wars should be fought.  Unrestricted by
<br>
politicians at any level.  Every operation in Laos had to have the pre approval
<br>
of the Ambassador, the State Dept, and the President.  As a result of these
<br>
political decisions we lost LS-85 and the debacle known as Lam Son 719, and
<br>
ultimately all of SEA.   Thousands died in SVN, more thousands in Laos, and more
<br>
than 1 million in Cambodia.   May the Gods forgive them, for I can't. 
<br>
<p>I remember all too well a visit to Ambassador Sullivan's office with Gen Lendley
<br>
trying to get security personnel for our in country Tacan sites.  His words, &quot;We
<br>
are in a war, and you people fail to realize in war you must expect
<br>
casualties&quot;.  Request denied.  He then went on to state that he had it from a
<br>
very good source that we had armed men across the river, and if he verified it,
<br>
we would be yanked out immediately.  I then told him yes we were armed, and gave
<br>
him a run down on the arms that we smuggled in labeled &quot;Combat Essential
<br>
Electronics Equipment&quot;.  I then asked him when we would be leaving.  He then
<br>
screamed to Gen Lendley that I was crazy, and for him to get me out of his
<br>
office. 
<br>
<p>We never did get orders to leave.  Sam Morrow, TLCB

<p>This tribute especially hits home because it vividly reflects the essence of the
<br>
SEA Vet's travail -- the deep love for our Brothers vs our anguish over the
<br>
disdain and outright hatred we encountered upon returning to the World. The
<br>
disdain from our &quot;fellow citizens&quot; was  truly hurtful but, in truth, it was the
<br>
politicians who delivered the telling body blow. 
<br>
<p>The hatred we encountered from the civilian population -- if never forgiven --
<br>
can perhaps be understood-- the ignorance behind it, the desire to be popular by
<br>
adopting a &quot;popular' cause, etc -- may give us some little tolerance for those
<br>
who castigated the returning Vet.  But the politicians involved? Never. 
<br>
<p>There's an old Zen adage that I paraphrase here: 
<br>
<p>&quot;do not hate and fear the tiger that tears your throat when you are thrust into
<br>
his domain; hate and fear he who has placed you there for his own
<br>
purpose...........&quot;

<p>Earl, 
<br>
<p>Got this off another net, a little late for Memorial Day, poignant but on the
<br>
money, especially with regard to &quot;Patriots &quot; that went on to be CEO's,
<br>
politicians etc. 
<br>
<p>Tom 
<br>
<p><p><p>This letter from F8 Crusader Pilot Dick Schaffert to his old roommate Norm Levy
<br>
is most appropriate for Memorial Day. I hope we all had someone like Norm in our
<br>
thoughts today, even if we could not express them as eloquently as did Dick. 
<br>
<p><p>Brown Bear sends: 
<br>
<p>To: LCDR Norm Levy 
<br>
<p>'Morning, Norm. It's Memorial Day, 07:29 Tonkin Gulf time. Haven't talked with
<br>
you in a while. Seems like a good day to make contact. It's 
<br>
36 years and 5 months to the day since I last saw you, sitting on the edge of
<br>
your bunk in our room on the Oriskany. You remember, it was the 26th of October
<br>
1966. We were on the midnight schedule. There was a solid wall of thunderstorms
<br>
over the beach--with tops to 
<br>
50K--but McNamara's Pentagon planners kept sending us on &quot;critical&quot; missions all
<br>
night. 
<br>
<p>At 04:00, they finally ran out of trucks to bomb--in that downpour--and we got a
<br>
little sleep. The phone rang at seven, you were scheduled for the Alert Five. I
<br>
had bagged a little mor! e rack time than you, so I said I'd take it. I went to
<br>
shave in the head around the elevator pit, the one near the flare locker. The
<br>
Ordies were busy putting away the flares. They'd been taking them out and
<br>
putting them back all night. I finished shaving and started back to our room
<br>
when the guy on the 1MC said: &quot;This is a drill, this is a drill, FIRE, FIRE,
<br>
FIRE!&quot; I smelled smoke and looked back at the door that separated the pilot's
<br>
quarters from the flare locker. Smoke was coming from underneath. I ran the last
<br>
few steps to our room and turned on the light. You sat up on the edge of your
<br>
bunk. I shouted at you: &quot;Norm, this is no drill. Let's get the hell out of
<br>
here!&quot; I went down the passage way around the elevator pit, banging on the metal
<br>
wall and shouting: &quot;It's no drill. We're on fire! We're on fire!&quot; I had rounded
<br>
the corner of that U-shaped passage when the flare locker exploded. There was a
<br>
tremendous concussion effect that blew me out of the passage way and into t! he
<br>
hangar deck. A huge ball of fire was rolling along the top of the hangar bay. 
<br>
<p>You and forty-five other guys, most of them Air Wing pilots, didn't make it,
<br>
Norm. I'm sorry. Oh, God, I'm sorry! But we went home together--Norm Levy, a
<br>
Jewish boy from Miami, and Dick Schaffert, a Lutheran cornhusker from Nebraska.
<br>
I rode in the economy class of that Flying Tigers 707, along with the other
<br>
surviving pilots. You were in a flag-draped box in the cargo compartment. The
<br>
San Diego media had found out about the return of us &quot;Baby Killers.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Lindberg Field was packed with scum enjoying the right to protest. The &quot;right&quot;
<br>
you died for! There was a bus, with our wives, waiting for us VF-111 Sundowners;
<br>
there was a black hearse for you. The protestors threw things at the bus and
<br>
your hearse, not a policeman in sight. When we finally got off the airport, they
<br>
chased us to Fort Rosecrans. They kept interrupting your graveside service,
<br>
until your honor guard of three brave you! ng Marines with M-16's convinced them
<br>
to stay back. 
<br>
<p>I watched the TV news with my children that night, Norm. Sorry, the only clips
<br>
of our homecoming were the Baby Killer banners and the one of the burned girl,
<br>
which they played nightly for 8 years. It was tough to explain that to four
<br>
pre-teenaged kids. You know how it went, Norm. The scum were the heroes--they
<br>
went on to be CEO's, who stole from our companies--lawyers, who preyed off our
<br>
misery--doctors, who we can't afford--and elected politicians, who broke the
<br>
faith and the promises. 
<br>
<p>The only military recognized as &quot;heroes&quot; were the POW's. They finally came home,
<br>
not because of some politician's expertise; but because there were those of us
<br>
who kept going back over Hanoi, again and again. Dodging the SAM's and the flak,
<br>
attacking day and night, keeping the pressure on--all by ourselves! Absolutely
<br>
no support from anyone else! Many of us didn't come home, Norm. You know, the
<br>
guys that are up there with you ! now. But it was our &quot;un-mentioned&quot; efforts
<br>
that brought the POW's home. We kept the faith with them, and with you, Norm. It
<br>
never really ended. We seemed to go directly from combat into disabled
<br>
retirement and poverty, ignored by those whose freedoms we insured by paying the
<br>
very high premium. The only thing many of us have left is our memories, Norm. We
<br>
hold those dear! We band together in groups like the Crusader Association. Some
<br>
might say that has to do with flying a peculiar aircraft, I say it has to do
<br>
with a peculiar bunch of guys. We'll all be joining you shortly, Norm. Put in a
<br>
good word for us with the Man. Ask him to think of us as His peacemakers, as His
<br>
children. Have a restful Memorial Day, Norm. You earned it. 
<br>
<p>Your Roomie, Brown Bear
