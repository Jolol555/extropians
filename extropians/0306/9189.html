<p>
Pardon me if I've got the threads mixed, and have not paid
<br>
attention to all the arguments about this, but I'm way 
<br>
behind on the serious discussions.
<br>
<p>Hal writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see both the averagist and totalist positions as being too extreme to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be effective strategies for altruism.  The averagist falls into the trap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that eliminating unhappy people makes the average happiness level rise.
</em><br>
<p>It's only a trap from a &quot;non-averagist&quot; value system.  The
<br>
averagist should defend his position, until there exists one
<br>
one supremely happy person in the universe (whose actual
<br>
level of happiness doesn't matter, only whose relative
<br>
level does).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And the totalist falls into the corresponding error, of increasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; population beyond the carrying capacity until everyone is just one step
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from committing suicide.
</em><br>
<p>I would say no.  The totalist as I conceive him, assigns negative
<br>
values of happiness (colloquially called 'unhappiness') to those
<br>
who are but one step away from suicide, so miserable, your implication
<br>
is, their lives have become.  Thus the totalist only wants to do
<br>
away with those whose lives are not worth living (as they contribute
<br>
negatively to the total).  Of course, the efficient totalist will 
<br>
not let go to waste such amazingly contrived organisms as unhappy
<br>
people, but will simply subdue their unhappiness with drugs or
<br>
direct-wire brain stimulation.
<br>
<p>I once participated in an organization called the Brother's Keepers.
<br>
We would assemble weekly and put on our robes and try to look like
<br>
medieval monks the best we could, right down to the bare feet or 
<br>
sandals.  We would also collect copious quantities of drugs that are
<br>
known to induce great happiness in human subjects (fear of prosecution
<br>
prevents me from being more explicit about which drugs, exactly).
<br>
Then when we ourselves were sufficiently happy---often just from
<br>
the prospect of what joy we were shortly to bring to people---
<br>
we would strike.
<br>
<p>Several of us would usually know some person or persons who had been
<br>
visited by great unhappiness---their girl had left them, a child had
<br>
died, a divorce, a loss of a job, etc.  We would wait until 11:00 in
<br>
the evening, and then run through the grass barefoot or with just our
<br>
sandals towards the residence of our intended victim.  To light the
<br>
way, at least one of us would carry a torch.  A knock on the door, and
<br>
then as soon as it opened a crack, we would all crash in.  The startled
<br>
victim would have no chance to reach the telephone and call 911, nor
<br>
even call out before we had him bound and gagged.
<br>
<p>The terror in our victims eyes as he saw a bunch of crazed middle-aged
<br>
men with the look of lunacy in their eyes can hardly be exaggerated.
<br>
His apparent terror was hardly lessened when he saw the three inch long
<br>
hypodermic needles that we waved in his direction, with the most gruesome
<br>
yet happy smiles on our faces.  &quot;Resistance is futile,&quot; we would cry,
<br>
&quot;no one can resist the Brothers Keepers!  Rejoice!&quot;.  But very soon the
<br>
terror in his eyes would be replaced by extreme ecstasy as the effect of the
<br>
drugs set in.  At this point he'd &quot;get it&quot;.  It would be excessively obvious
<br>
to him that all his unhappiness had merely been due to the dominance of
<br>
unfortunate chemicals in his brain, which now the sublime saints of the
<br>
Brothers Keepers had overcome with chemicals of their own.
<br>
<p>In every case, so extreme was the joy visited upon our victim that tears
<br>
of happiness would roll down his cheeks, and he would beg to join our merry
<br>
band and proceed with us to the residence of the next unhappy person on
<br>
our list.  We were always careful to bring extra robes and pairs of sandals,
<br>
so that the initiate could fully participate in the next glorious salvation
<br>
(Errand of Mercy) of the evening.  Finally, near dawn, with the list of
<br>
unhappy persons exhausted, we would retire separately to our own homes,
<br>
feeling not only the righteousness of our civilized charity, but in all
<br>
too many cases additional happiness that stemmed from use of several of
<br>
the chemicals that we didn't want to go to waste.
<br>
<p>So if you are ever really, really very unhappy, you may wish to keep it
<br>
to yourself, or else you may receive a midnight visit from the Brothers
<br>
Keepers.
<br>
<p>Lee
