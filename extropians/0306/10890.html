<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Brett raises one of our oldest and most fruitlessly debated topics:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; whether an upload or a cryonics revivee is &quot;the same&quot; person he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I believe the question is meaningless
</em><br>
<p>If the question keeps coming up and cryonics and uploading is
<br>
something we want to gain community support for, at least 
<br>
sufficient support to ensure we are not prevented from developing
<br>
and using these options ourselves, it seems sensibly that by now
<br>
we should have canned best answers for the reoccuring questions. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; yes, especially seeing as how we really do not have any choice, 
</em><br>
<p>Uploading is not an option today, burial or cremation seem to
<br>
offer less chance than cryonics so it might be argued cryonics
<br>
is the smart current choice. On what I understand at present 
<br>
I'd agree with this assessment. But I don't like the arguments
<br>
or rather the lack of them much. Cryonics is not selling well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; as it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent (to me, anyway) that virtual immortality or radical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life extension is not right around the corner.  So, if you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to live, go for cryonics. Otherwise, take your chances elsewhere.
</em><br>
<p>There are two good reasons for giving a damn. 
<br>
<p>1) Better understanding of what is involved in preserving personal
<br>
identity may make for better procedures. 
<br>
<p>2) The better explanations make for better marketing and the 
<br>
success of cryonics and uploading may require not just fostering
<br>
a more positive acceptance to these ideas in the community but
<br>
being able to answer objections from those who may try and
<br>
remove the right of those who wish to attempt to use cryonics
<br>
or uploading themselves.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
<br>
<p>(Sorry I should have bundled responses to this thread up
<br>
a bit better).
