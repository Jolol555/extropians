&nbsp;We seek the truth ultimately to gain freedom:
<br>
<em>&gt; freedom of action, freedom of knowledge, freedom of opportunity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Knowing the truth maximizes our options for effective action in the world,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because it allows us to make the most accurate predictions of the effects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of our actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
There are all sorts of instrumental reasons for valuing the truth--as
<br>
prosaic as allowing you to do better at Jeopardy. The &quot;moral&quot; problem seems
<br>
to be that we seem to be willing to pay a high price for the pursuit of
<br>
truth, a price that looks like it might be disproportionate to the value
<br>
that one might  think on reflection that true confers to the seeker. If this
<br>
is correct then the sort of instrumental explanation you offer can at best
<br>
only be part of the story. There are, after all, all sorts of real and
<br>
hypothetical cases where seeking the truth leads to the loss of freedom of
<br>
action, opportunity and effective action. If we are talking these freedoms
<br>
in terms of individuals then Galileo might be adduced as an example. If we
<br>
are talking in terms of the contribution of to our collective freedom (and
<br>
arguably Galileo sacrificed his freedom for our freedom) then we can imagine
<br>
a case where we discover the truth that we are in a simulation and then our
<br>
program is wiped because then the experiment is spoiled. In this case,
<br>
obviously, seeking the truth need not necessarily contribute to our freedom,
<br>
and indeed may detract from it. What is noteworthy here is that even if we
<br>
think that the cost of discovering this truth (that we live in a simulation)
<br>
is not worth the cost (the wiping of our simulation), nevertheless,
<br>
discovering the truth about our simulation still seems to be something good
<br>
even though it does not seem to contribute anything to our welfare (and
<br>
indeed seems to detract from it).
