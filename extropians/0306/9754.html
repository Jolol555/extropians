<p>There are monarchists in Italy. They can freely speak about bringing the
<br>
monarchy back. Actually doing so would require a modification of the
<br>
Constitution.
<br>
<p>Of course, the Constitution provide ways to change itself. A complex
<br>
procedure is required, as you can imagine :-) . Basically, 66% or more of
<br>
both parliaments houses is required, plus a slew of OK signs from various
<br>
sources, plus a special commission, etc. But it can be done. It has been
<br>
done for a few issues. Some months ago, the ex-monarch Savoia family was
<br>
allowed to enter Italy again. A Constitution change was required for this,
<br>
it was done, and I couldn't care less.
<br>
<p>There are many Nazi/Fascist nostalgics. A real Fascist party is forbidden
<br>
by the constitution, but this does not prevent Mussolini granddaugther to
<br>
sit in the Parliament, because she was elected as part of National
<br>
Alliance, the main right-wing party (I mean right-wing in an European
<br>
sense). There are parties that are to all effects Fascist except the name.
<br>
They get about 0.2% of votes. On the other side of the spectrum there is a
<br>
Marxist-Leninist party. It also gets some 0.2% of the votes.
<br>
<p>All of them are allowed to partecipate, and no one refers to them as
<br>
&quot;enemy of Italy&quot;. Maybe they are enemy of the current political-economic
<br>
system, and disagree about what the current government is doing - if so,
<br>
they are in good company :-)
<br>
<p>Ciao,
<br>
Alfio
