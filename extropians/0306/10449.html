<br>
<em>&gt; Just a thought..... It doesn't seem likely that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; massive breakthroughs are predictable 20 years in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advance. In 1949,noone expected to be on the moon in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1969. In 1883, powered flight wasn't expected anytime
</em><br>
<em>&gt; soon. In 1976, the current access to information was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfathomable except to a few people speculating. There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was no real expectation of it happening. Thus is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature of discovery.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Certainly.  There could be a breakthrough next year that changes
<br>
everything in the field of AI.  I'm not saying it's impossible, just
<br>
that there's no hard evidence to suggest that it's going to happen.
<br>
In the absence of that evidence, and in the context of decades of
<br>
unmet expectations for AI, I think it makes sense to take a more
<br>
conservative view of the field.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Or, to appeal to the Cult of Bayes out there, what priors would lead a
<br>
Bayesian to believe that AGI is anywhere near realization?  Whatever
<br>
they are, I must not have them.
