<p>
It turns out that economists can trace most of the social problems in the
<br>
world to secrets, things some people know that other people do not.  It also
<br>
turns out that verifiable secrets are not really much of a problem.  When
<br>
there is something that someone knows, but they could reveal and prove it to
<br>
someone else, a variety of institutions can induce people to reveal that
<br>
information.  So the real problem is unverifiable secrets.
<br>
<p>For example, if a nation wants to make an arms treaty, but is concerned
<br>
about the possibility of the other side cheating, they might each agree to
<br>
open their military bases or production facilities to inspection.  When
<br>
corporate directors want to convince investors that they are not stealing
<br>
the money, they hire accountants to reveal corporate spending.  When
<br>
individuals want to insure a home, they allow an insurance company
<br>
representative to inspect their home's current condition.
<br>
<p>So why do individuals still have secrets?  Some of their secrets are
<br>
verifiable, but only at a prohibitive cost.  Insurance companies could set
<br>
insurance rates based on how carefully you drive, but it is now too
<br>
expensive for them to put a recorder on your car that records exactly how
<br>
carefully you drive.  This may change in the next decade, however.  And in
<br>
general as costs fall we should expect to see people agreeing to reveal more
<br>
verifiable info about themselves to solve secrecy problems.
<br>
<p>Some of the secrets people have, however, are in their heads.  Is my spouse
<br>
still happy with me, or is he thinking of leaving?  Does my business partner
<br>
really plan to work hard, or is he hoping I'll do most of the work?  Now
<br>
some of this info is revealed in our observable behavior so far; humans have
<br>
evolved to be &quot;leaky&quot;, and to be good at detecting such leaks in the
<br>
behavior of others.  And as we have been discussing in the &quot;Why believe the
<br>
truth&quot; thread, this leakiness has induced evolution to bias our beliefs, in
<br>
order to impress others.
<br>
<p>The need to be close enough to others to detect such leaks is one of the key
<br>
obstacles limiting telecommuting and other long-distance relationships that
<br>
otherwise seem so attractive.  Some day cheap long-distance communication
<br>
may have enough bandwidth to allow us to detect such leaks as we usually do,
<br>
and we may perhaps also develop automation that can detect such leaks up
<br>
close, so we don't need the bandwidth.
<br>
<p>How leaky will our distant descendants be?  How far will they want to go,
<br>
and be able to go, in agreeing to reveal their secrets to each other, to
<br>
avoid the social problems that secrets cause?  It seems plausible that our
<br>
descendants will be constructed so that they can allow outsiders to directly
<br>
inspect the internal state of their minds, to verify the absence of certain
<br>
harmful secrets.  It also seems plausible that our descendants will feel a
<br>
pressure to standardize the internal state of their mind to facilitate such
<br>
inspection, just as corporations now feel pressure to standardize their
<br>
accounting.
<br>
<p>Of course we already expect other pressures to standardize, such as to take
<br>
advantage of improvements in mind modules.  Even so, our descendants will
<br>
probably not reveal everything to everyone; not all possible agreements will
<br>
be made, and there will remain some advantages to non-standard mind parts,
<br>
which can then become costly to verify (sure I see these bits here in your
<br>
mind, but what the hell to they mean?).
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, as an overall long term trend, I'm leaning toward expecting not
<br>
only a move toward a transparent society (a la Brin), but then toward
<br>
transparent minds as well.  And one disturbing implication of this is that
<br>
we may well evolve to become even *more* self-deceived than we are now,
<br>
as believing one thing and thinking another becomes even harder than now.
