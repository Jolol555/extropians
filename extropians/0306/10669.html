</em><br>
<p>&lt;more quotes snipped&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;

</em><br>
<p>I can understand your sentiment here but in the case of 
<br>
newspapers I think there is likely to be pretty clear rules 
<br>
about words that can't be used. Even if there are not, there
<br>
are some people who, for whatever reason, have a strong 
<br>
negative reaction to certain words. So if one still wants to 
<br>
communicate with those people (and papers still want to 
<br>
sell them papers), then its simply more *effective* to change
<br>
the language so that a wider audience or readership will
<br>
actually be able to take in the story or the message.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; On the eve of the Iraq war I found a similar attitude here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the list, too. People who cold-bloodedly accepted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a lot of innocent civilians would die in this war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused me of using shocking terms that referred to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these overwhelming peristaltic movements that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; automatically started in my guts when being confronted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with pictures of your proud and praying nation. 
</em><br>
<p>Like you, I had a pretty strong negative reaction to the
<br>
war. I did not support this war. But I think I would 
<br>
support some wars. I did support the previous war by the
<br>
previous President Bush. And I don't just suppport war as
<br>
an &quot;absolute last resort&quot; because such is empty rhetoric that
<br>
can't be operationalised. And at this stage of human evolution 
<br>
some people will know when the rhetoric is just that and
<br>
take you to the brink. Saddam *was* a career brinksman.
<br>
<p>Regardless of what was written I don't think anybody on 
<br>
this list had a cold-blooded acceptance of the loss of 
<br>
civilian lives. I think there was a lot of venting because 
<br>
most people were affected by the war but did not really
<br>
perceive that they could actually do anything much about it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One person even claimed that with my description of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this visceral activity I had left the path of civility while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he and his co-patriots were willing to sacrifice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thousands of human beings for a not existing threat.
</em><br>
<p>I do think that the Secretary of Puke idea was probably
<br>
a suboptimal way of making your point on a topic very
<br>
*worthy* of serious discussion but very hard to have 
<br>
when the stakes were so high and emotions so charged.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Pretty soon these killing machines and mass murderers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who did the job for you will return to your country and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will live among you. I know what it feels like to live 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; among mass murderes. My father was one, my 8 uncles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were war criminals, when they survived WWII, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; priests I got to know were mass murderers, almost all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my teachers had been killing machines and not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single one of them was healthy and happy. They were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all broken personalities, somehow.
</em><br>
<p>I can't agree with this assessment. Soldiers kill yes. So
<br>
sometimes so do police and incompetent doctors. 
<br>
<p>If you use the words killing machines and mass murderers
<br>
to describe ordinary soldiers, which seem to be the type
<br>
describes in the article above (or perhaps some of the
<br>
more crass less media savvy ones and media savvy isn't
<br>
big in military training) and to describe your own relatives
<br>
(who I imagine were also soldiers) then the words loss
<br>
their meaning when you really need them. From reading
<br>
your passae above I can't tell if there was a private
<br>
Mania who found under orders in a war he didn't 
<br>
understand or if he was an architect or gas chambers or
<br>
a voluntary assistant who requested to be transferred to
<br>
work with Mengele. There is lots of room in between.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To clarify my personal definition of a mass murderer: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *every* person in a mass murderer who killed more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  than two humans in his life, no matter if he took part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a war of aggression or if he defended his country. 
</em><br>
<p>I think your definition is too sweeping to be useful. It
<br>
would include surgeons who only operate on the marginal
<br>
patients. It would include every military commander
<br>
competent or otherwise who ordered men into battle in
<br>
order to achieve an outcome of  &quot;less evil&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can laugh about my definition and start to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enumerate the reasons for a just war - yes, yes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yes, but no, no no -  I don't give a damn about any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war convention
</em><br>
<p>I'm not laughing. I do care about the rule of law and
<br>
of standards of decency and moral shades of grey. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if you defend your country, *afterwards you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must live with the guilt* of having killed human beings.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't know anybody of the mass murderers I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  personally met who had not - in the deepest place 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of his heart - a rest of guilt he had to drown with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; booze or other anaesthetics.
</em><br>
<p>As you say, you don't know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In my imagination transhumanism cannot be achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before the territorial fighting mechanisms from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reptile brain are abolished or appeased or cultivated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow. One generation has to start with this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mission impossible. I would like to belong to this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generation.
</em><br>
<p>In your imagination is transhumanism a &quot;destination&quot; or
<br>
a &quot;transitioning&quot; perhaps more like a journey? 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Peace on earth
</em><br>
<p>A noble goal but we must approach it *practically* and
<br>
with the use of our wits as well as our hearts. There is 
<br>
no magic switch we can flip to right all that is wrong.
<br>
We must triage. And sometimes, in frustration, we may 
<br>
vent and find fault with the different triaging decisions 
<br>
made by others who also work on imperfect 
<br>
information.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
