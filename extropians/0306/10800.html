I actually thought of this a year or so prior to the
<br>
Iraq war, and I decided not to say anything about it,
<br>
but, since then, other people have publicly discussed
<br>
this idea....
<br>
<p>Yes, I assumed that sat mirrors would be an option for
<br>
lasers - of course!  However, sats are quite
<br>
vulnerable to some fairly low tech attacks.  Even now
<br>
sats are being taken out regularly, I understand, by
<br>
the debris from all the junk and collisions between
<br>
junk and other junk, which keeps accumulating.  Now
<br>
one good military idea that Saddam had at least ten
<br>
years ago was to simply build huge cannons into the
<br>
sides of hills, as tunnels, aimed at Israel.  
<br>
<p>Potentially, however, the size of the projected
<br>
cannons and the velocity they could achieve could just
<br>
as well put heavy artillary shells into orbit, or
<br>
deliver them anywhere on a ballistic trajectory.  Such
<br>
cannons could deliver shells designed to explode in
<br>
space, as secondary guns, huge shotguns blasting
<br>
hundreds of pounds of the hardest sand-sized material
<br>
available into paths that would take out billions of
<br>
dollars of sats.  The relative velocities could
<br>
easilly be high enough - especially if the orbits were
<br>
in the opposite direction, or separated by a
<br>
considerable angle - to vaporize a tunnel right thru a
<br>
substantial mass, taking out the electronic brains
<br>
that keep those mirrors aligned.  
<br>
<p>And there are a lot of other similar options by which
<br>
a terrorist nation could cheaply wipe out virtually
<br>
the entire existing sat industry - and make it almost
<br>
impossible to rebuild for months or years to follow,
<br>
as all that stuff gradually slowed down and burned up
<br>
in the high atmosphere.
