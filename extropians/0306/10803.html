In the article below it seems the myc cancer causing gene 
<br>
(which is already known to be responsible for about a third
<br>
&nbsp;of all cancers (bad gene, very bad! ) produces the protein
<br>
that activates the Werner's gene (a fine friendly gene, one
<br>
warms naturally to it, - because in healthy folk that don't suffer
<br>
from the rare premature aging syndrome known as Werners
<br>
when the gene is broken) it is actually involved in keeping 
<br>
cells young and growing. 
<br>
<p>So, the bummer of it is, the gene that keeps cells young and
<br>
growing is fired off by a gene that gives you cancer. Sort of.
<br>
<p>Irritating universe. Still it is better to know. As now, maybe,
<br>
we can gerry rig some sort of work around or kludge. 
<br>
<p>Also, we may get some more insight into kicking cancers butt.
<br>
<p>------------
<br>
<p>Scientists identify genetic link between cancer and aging
<br>
<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-06/cshl-sig062303.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-06/cshl-sig062303.php</a>
<br>
<p>A collaboration of scientists mainly from the Fred Hutchinson
<br>
Cancer Center and at the University of Washington (Seattle)
<br>
has made an important discovery linking the powerful cancer
<br>
-causing oncogene, myc, with the gene behind the premature
<br>
aging disease, Werner syndrome. Their finding reveals that the
<br>
MYC oncoprotein turns-on Werner syndrome gene 
<br>
expression, and posits the Werner syndrome gene as a 
<br>
potentially important participant in MYC-induced tumorigenesis. 
<br>
<p>Werner syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by 
<br>
the appearance of old age beginning after puberty. It is caused
<br>
by mutations in the Werner syndrome gene (WRN), which 
<br>
resides on the short arm of human chromosome 8. The WRN 
<br>
gene encodes a DNA helicase (an enzyme that unwinds DNA)
<br>
involved in DNA replication and repair. 
<br>
..
<br>
<p>As Dr. Grandori explains, &quot;We uncovered a role in 
<br>
oncogenesis for a gene, WRN, whose function was known to
<br>
be important in maintaining youth of the whole organism. This
<br>
study was prompted by the characteristic ability of tumor cells
<br>
in culture to multiply indefinitely and thus to exhibit permanent
<br>
youth. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that 
<br>
genetic programs that limit organismal aging may, at the cellular
<br>
level, promote tumor development, thus constituting a double 
<br>
sword. On the positive side, we hope that our study will 
<br>
provide a new therapeutic target able to trigger tumor cells
<br>
into senescence.&quot; 
<br>
<p>etc
<br>

<p>- Brett Paatsch
<br>
<p>PS:  &quot;Dr Ray Monnet at the Universtity of washington notes 
<br>
that &quot;we have recognized deep links between cell senescence
<br>
and tumorigenesis for some time. Its gratifying (sic) to see 
<br>
another of these links identified that is conceptually interesting
<br>
and may (sic) have practical importance&quot;.
<br>
<p>That Dr. Ray has 'scientific detachment' down to an art form.
