Word for Word on the Web, Isaac Newton's Secret Musings
<br>
<p>June 12, 2003
<br>
By PETER DIZIKES
<br>
<p><p>JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES called them &quot;fascinating&quot; and read them
<br>
in taxis. Albert Einstein called them &quot;unique treasures.''
<br>
But for roughly 300 years, just a handful of people had
<br>
ever seen Isaac Newton's voluminous writings on alchemy and
<br>
theology. Now that is changing, thanks to a group of
<br>
scholars who are making them available on the Internet.
<br>
<p>The Newton Project, a joint effort based at the University
<br>
of London, aims gradually to post all of the scientist's
<br>
previously unpublished work at a Web site
<br>
(&lt; <a href="http://www.newtonproject.ic.ac.uk">http://www.newtonproject.ic.ac.uk</a> &gt;), including thousands of pages
<br>
of alchemical and theological writings and, eventually,
<br>
some of his optical studies. The material, which may take
<br>
15 to 20 years to finish transcribing, will be accompanied
<br>
by high-resolution images of the manuscripts.
<br>
<p>The enterprise was founded in 1998 by a small group of
<br>
Newton scholars who had grown tired of seeing the complete
<br>
writings of other important thinkers published only as
<br>
expensive multivolume editions that would invariably
<br>
languish in a few academic libraries.
<br>
<p>&quot;In these projects in the past, you've got scholars who
<br>
produce very high-quality printed texts for about three
<br>
people,&quot; said Rob Iliffe, a historian at the University of
<br>
London and a co-founder of the project. &quot;Ordinary people
<br>
who've funded these things, taxpayers, don't have access.&quot;
<br>
<p>For the Newton Project, said Dr. Iliffe, &quot;My image was of
<br>
something that would be available to anybody with a
<br>
computer - an 8-year-old kid, an intelligent lay reader, a
<br>
university scholar.&quot;
<br>
<p>But Newton is famous for his work in physics and
<br>
mathematics. Why publish his thoughts about religion or
<br>
alchemy?
<br>
<p>&quot;Newton did not compartmentalize himself,&quot; said Mordechai
<br>
Feingold, a historian of science at the California
<br>
Institute of Technology in Pasadena, Calif., who is an
<br>
adviser to the project and the curator of an exhibition on
<br>
Newton's influence that is to open at the New York Public
<br>
Library next year. &quot;To understand the man himself, we must
<br>
understand the various facets of his own activities.&quot;
<br>
<p>Other Newton scholars, while intrigued, are taking a
<br>
wait-and-see approach. &quot;The question is how much light it
<br>
will shed on Newton and the emergence of Newtonian
<br>
science,&quot; said Alan Shapiro, a historian of science at the
<br>
University of Minnesota.
<br>
<p>But George E. Smith, a philosopher of science at Tufts
<br>
University in Medford, Mass., said there was no clear
<br>
distinction in Newton's time between chemistry and alchemy
<br>
and that he expected the papers to reveal much about
<br>
17th-century science. &quot;He did a huge amount of chemistry,&quot;
<br>
he said. &quot;It's a broad form of investigation characteristic
<br>
of the time. No one has really worked through those
<br>
manuscripts in any detail.&quot;
<br>
<p>Newton spent years studying alchemy, using furnaces in his
<br>
Cambridge rooms to conduct experiments. He wrote thousands
<br>
of pages in his notebooks about religion but kept his views
<br>
almost completely secret. Although loyal to the Church of
<br>
England, he feared that his anti-trinitarian beliefs - he
<br>
thought that regarding Christ as God was a sin - would
<br>
destroy his career.
<br>
<p>Enhancing the mystery in this side of Newton, the
<br>
alchemical and theological papers remained in private hands
<br>
from Newton's death in 1727 until they were sold at a
<br>
Sotheby's auction in London in 1936. Among the buyers was
<br>
Keynes, the legendary Cambridge economist and monetary
<br>
expert, who scooped up the bulk of the alchemical writings
<br>
chiefly to save them.
<br>
<p>Keynes then donated his holdings to Kings College,
<br>
Cambridge, though not before studying Newton in his spare
<br>
time. &quot;There are stories that Keynes read these things in
<br>
taxis going from one Treasury meeting to the next,&quot; Dr.
<br>
Iliffe said.
<br>
<p>Many of Newton's theological writings were purchased from
<br>
Sotheby's by Abraham Yahuda, an iconoclastic scholar who
<br>
enlisted the services of Einstein, a close friend, in an
<br>
effort to resell them. Despite letters from Einstein
<br>
vouching for the papers' importance, several prominent
<br>
American universities are said to have declined to acquire
<br>
the collection, which wound up in a Jerusalem archive. In
<br>
all, nearly 40 libraries, from Jerusalem to Geneva to Los
<br>
Angeles, now own portions of Newton's work; bits of it have
<br>
circulated on microfilm.
<br>
<p>Over all, an estimated 2.7 million words are to be
<br>
transcribed from Newton's small, right-slanting handwriting
<br>
on pages littered with crossed-out words, revisions and
<br>
equations.
<br>
<p>A zoom tool at the Web site can be used to magnify the
<br>
scanned images of Newton's original manuscripts, making it
<br>
easier for users to read them. The site is adding a search
<br>
engine this year so that readers can find recurring topics
<br>
in the sprawl of Newton's work. Web publishing also gives
<br>
the project the ability to incorporate scholarly revisions
<br>
and commentaries nearly instantly.
<br>
<p>With people perusing the works on the Internet, Dr. Iliffe
<br>
said, the Newton Project can also receive valuable
<br>
assistance from around the globe. &quot;People who are
<br>
interested can write to us and say, 'Look, we've discovered
<br>
a mistake in your transcriptions,' &quot; he said. &quot;There is a
<br>
sense in which end-users can become part of the authorial
<br>
team.&quot;
<br>
<p>In the meantime, the project's scholars face new
<br>
challenges. Their main financing, a five-year British
<br>
government grant, expires in 2004. Another concern is
<br>
ensuring that their software does not become obsolete by
<br>
the time the project is completed. &quot;The one deep problem
<br>
about electronic scholarship is we don't know how it will
<br>
be preserved in the long run,&quot; Dr. Smith said. The Newton
<br>
Project's transcriptions are now being coded in XML, but
<br>
members say they are wary of being derailed by changing
<br>
standards. For this reason, they are considering an
<br>
eventual print companion to the site.
<br>
<p>If the Newton Project seems like an unending effort, the
<br>
team can always draw inspiration from the scientist
<br>
himself. &quot;Newton never thought anything he did was
<br>
finished,&quot; Dr. Iliffe said. &quot;He was constantly revising his
<br>
work and he was never satisfied.&quot;
