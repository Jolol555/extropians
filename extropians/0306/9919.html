Rafal stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;### The US middle class has a decent life already. Sacrificing long-term
<br>
growth for the sake of minor short-term improvements is a loss. A Crown Vic
<br>
instead of a Taurus today means the LongLife(TM) pill could come just a few
<br>
months too late for many.
<br>
Rafal &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The thing is, many people, even in IT, who have lost their jobs because 
<br>
corporations wish to squeeze down costs, rather than have to work at producing 
<br>
goods and services, may indeed, have difficulty even purchasing a Taurus, let 
<br>
alone a Crown Vic. On another matter, it would be nice if the life-extention 
<br>
breakthroughs were not so much smoke and mirrors. A hugely extended life span, with 
<br>
a hugely extended range of good health would surely change the economy. But 
<br>
that is another topic.
