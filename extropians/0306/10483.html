<p>It sounds as if you don't disagree with my claim; you just don't see why I 
<br>
would bother to make such a claim.
<br>
<p>There are many things that I do not like about academia, but on this point 
<br>
I have internalized the academic priority given to intellectual 
<br>
modularity.  In academia, different people work on different topics, and 
<br>
hope to combine their results later.  When discussing each topic, one tries 
<br>
to minimize the dependencies of results in this area to results in other 
<br>
areas.  Of course there will have to be some dependencies, but avoiding 
<br>
unnecessary dependencies allows more rapid progress, just as modularity 
<br>
aids the design of most systems.
<br>
<p>If there is a standard position in some area, and a contrarian alternative 
<br>
position in that area, and you are doing work in some other area which 
<br>
depends on this first area, your first priority is to say what the standard 
<br>
position would imply for your research, and only after having done that may 
<br>
you turn to seeing what the alternative position would imply.
<br>
<p>I am trying to make our discussion of &quot;why believe in truth&quot; be modular 
<br>
with respect to the very contrarian position that our goals are very 
<br>
different from what evolution has given us, or that the world will soon be 
<br>
very different from what evolution has adapted to.  The fact that you and I 
<br>
might happen to agree with this contrarian position is besides the 
<br>
point.  My first priority is to make our conversation be accessible and 
<br>
relevant to the majority who do not share this contrarian position.
