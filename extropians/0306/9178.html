</em><br>
<p>Yes, what I meant by &quot;immediately&quot; is that each person cannot predict the
<br>
other person's next opinion relative to the opinion he just stated.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Now, I think one reason is that this is the discussion which will occur
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if people are constrained to only describe their opinions. And in that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;case, there is a problem. While we can guarantee that people will come to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;agreement, there is no guarantee that the agreement is correct. ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So our conventional pattern, which is to exchange the reasons for our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beliefs, is actually superior in terms of providing information useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for survival. Nevertheless, I suspect that upon an exchange like this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;where each party says &quot;I believe X for reason Y&quot;, it would be appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for the participants to adjust their beliefs along the lines above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They might continue to discuss and give their reasons, but their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;beliefs about which side is likely to be right should switch back and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;forth randomly. ...
</em><br>
<p>The result of being unable to predict the other person's next opinion
<br>
is true regardless of what other information is also communicated at
<br>
each step.  I think Hal understands this, but it might not be clear to
<br>
readers of the above.
