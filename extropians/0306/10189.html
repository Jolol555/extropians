</em><br>
<p>And Dossy may not simply have been talking about selling at +10% *once* -
<br>
this can be done on the same stock (or various other stocks) several times a
<br>
year, leading to decent gains.  If one were invested in a stock like TGEN
<br>
recently (as my husband was), one would have realized 400% gains in a few
<br>
days.  (My advice for people who make a 400% gain on a stock, by the way, is
<br>
to SELL the whole lot - or at least a portion of your investment - *don't*
<br>
think twice!).
<br>
<p>How does the average investor know when to buy or sell?   This would depend
<br>
on the price at which the investor bought the stock, and whether they're
<br>
investing long term, short-term, or for a swing trade, but one very simple
<br>
guide that may prove useful for the average investor is AmericanBulls (this
<br>
is only one *guide* of many that may be used, and does not take into account
<br>
the next morning's news that hasn't happened yet, etc.).  Here is their most
<br>
recent recommendation on Drugstore.com (DSCM), e.g. (you can plug in any
<br>
stock symbol to find what's up with a stock you may happen to own):
<br>
<a href="http://www.americanbulls.com/StockPage.asp?CompanyTicker=DSCM%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;MarketTicker=NASD%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;TYP=S">http://www.americanbulls.com/StockPage.asp?CompanyTicker=DSCM%20%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;MarketTicker=NASD%20%20%20%20%20%20&amp;TYP=S</a><br>
<p>Don't know what's up with you gts.  It doesn't seem to matter when I tell
<br>
you that there are reliable techniques (not perfect on every trade, but
<br>
reliable overall and potentially very profitable), and that while I grant it
<br>
takes a lot of time and effort to learn the business (for people who are not
<br>
average investors but who are doing this for a living) - it is possible to
<br>
make a living trading and investing.  The business is not for everyone as it
<br>
is a sure bet one will lose money initially while learning, but that's the
<br>
*price* of this education.  For those people who stick it out and learn from
<br>
their mistakes this business can be (dare I say it? yes, I've found it to be
<br>
...) fun and a good source of income.  It may take a year - possibly two.
<br>
Not too many people stick it out that long, but I'm talking about those who
<br>
do (and they're the people I happen to know as I've gotten involved in
<br>
trading and investing).
