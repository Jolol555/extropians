<p><em>&gt; Personally, I've been finding continuing thinking on the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness quite unsettling. The problem is as follows:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Axiom: I am.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tenuous hypothesis 1: I have sensory input implying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other stuff, and so it is too.  [Too what, tenuous?]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tenuous hypothesis 2: I am part of the set of other stuff. 
</em><br>
<p>You better jolly well believe that you are part of the
<br>
other stuff.  The materialistic hypothesis is everything
<br>
that we could ask for: for four hundred years it has had
<br>
an unbroken track record of success, it's simple, and
<br>
it's almost free of contradictions (and they're tiny).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (much deduction, investigation, leading to negation of concept of conscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self; self is an illusion, &quot;I&quot; am just a pattern of information)
</em><br>
<p>Well, it depends (of course) on what we ought to
<br>
properly believe the &quot;self&quot; to be.  I think that
<br>
there exists a proper notion of self completely
<br>
compatible with materialism.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I find that if I take Tenuous Hypotheses 1 &amp; 2 as axioms, I produce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; result:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Result: I am not.
</em><br>
<p>It looks probable to me that your notion of self is such
<br>
that you do not have one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By my original axiom, I now have A and ~A. I've just flushed reality down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the toilet. What is existence?
</em><br>
<p>The self-awareness of certain machines whose ability
<br>
to map their environment extends warily into mapping
<br>
themselves as a point in their environment?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can't fault the materialist viewpoint, because I can't support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative; the closer I look, the more it appears that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible role at all for any proposed non-physical piece of consciousness.
</em><br>
<p>Yay.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So intelligent thought is a purely physical phenomenon, about information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processing. Which means that &quot;I&quot; am not; &quot;I&quot; am an illusion (fooling who?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what?).
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me (or if you prefer, to this instance of Lee Corbin)
<br>
that there probably exists a satisfactory meaning to be associated
<br>
with &quot;I&quot; also.  I am finding that emphasizing the difference between
<br>
Tegmark's &quot;frog perspective&quot; and &quot;bird perspective&quot; helps clarity
<br>
an old dichotomy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can only find paradox at the base of any search for an explanation of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only phenomenon in the universe that I can definitely call axiomatic (that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am). To me, it is more clearly evident than the existence of anything else.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I totally agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But apparently it cannot be true. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Help.
</em><br>
<p>Well, our course of action is clear!  We need only reform our
<br>
notions of &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, and &quot;self&quot; so that the inconsistencies
<br>
disappear.  Now it has appeared to many thoughtful people that
<br>
this cannot be done without doing excess violence to what those
<br>
tokens conventionally mean.  The same fate has befallen &quot;free
<br>
will&quot;.
<br>
<p>But I, and also a number of thoughtful people, think that (unlike
<br>
&quot;phlogiston&quot; and &quot;soul&quot;) all of the above can be used to usefully
<br>
communicate, and that all of the above can refer to objectively
<br>
evident pieces of reality.
