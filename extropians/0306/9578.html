<p>You don't have to explain the market to me, Olga. :)  In case I didn't make
<br>
it clear, I spent 12 years of my life as a general securities broker. For
<br>
many years I was a broker for Merrill Lynch, the same firm involved in this
<br>
scandal. I left the business about ten years ago.
<br>
<p>I disagree with your view that stop orders are necessarily a good idea for
<br>
any stock position. They often cause investors to get stopped out of a good
<br>
stock on a minor decline, only to see it immediately recover. But this is
<br>
not really a discussion about smart trading strategies. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; But that's what I was addressing.  If Martha used a stop loss the day 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or night before the IMCLE drop, then it would look suspicious
</em><br>
<p>It would look suspicious, yes, but it is not a crime to do things that look
<br>
suspicious, nor it is it intelligent to take a loss on a stock merely to
<br>
avoid suspicious appearances. 
<br>
<p>She may only have been lucky. I don't personally believe it was luck, (I
<br>
think she was acting intelligently and rationally by trading on so-called
<br>
inside information), but the burden of proof is on the prosecution to show
<br>
that she wasn't just lucky. 
<br>
<p>And actually this all may be moot anyway... according to her attorney at
<br>
<a href="http://www.marthatalks.com/legal/index.html">http://www.marthatalks.com/legal/index.html</a> the indictment is not even about
<br>
her suspicious stock trade. I haven't read the 41 page indictment but
<br>
according to her attorney the gov't is trying to prosecute her for covering
<br>
up an insider trade that it won't accuse her of making in the first place.
<br>
(?) Strange if true.
<br>
<p>I opened this thread mainly to discuss and debate my admittedly
<br>
controversial position against insider trading laws -- not against
<br>
obstruction of justice laws -- but as it turns out Martha may not be in
<br>
trouble for insider trading after all. It is for that reason that I opened
<br>
another thread called &quot;Insider trading and market efficiency.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, I was talking mostly about stocks and investment strategies - 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as that's my forte.
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure you are very wise investor, Olga, but personally I just wish I had
<br>
nickel for every person I've known in life who thought they knew something
<br>
about investments when in fact they did not. 
<br>
<p>Remember that every time you buy or sell a stock, there is someone on the
<br>
other side of the transaction who thinks she's just smart as you are. She
<br>
might even think it's her forte. :)
