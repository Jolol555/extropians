<p><em>&gt; &gt;  I have never read a post of Damien's in which he refers to a Vietnamese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Communist &quot;re-education camp omelette&quot;, a Castro or Mengistu's &quot;famine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;omelette&quot;, or even a Saddam Hussein's &quot;oily omelette&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The occasion hasn't arisen.
</em><br>
<p>Oh Cmon, out of all the times we have discussed vietnam here, you have never
<br>
once felt compelled to say that the North Vietnamese government is actually
<br>
murderous and oppressive, has effectively enslaved the vietnamese population
<br>
for 3 decades, and is overtly anti-extropic?  Afraid you might alienate
<br>
members of this board who helped to bring about that enslavement, or perhaps
<br>
the members who felt 'the good guys won'
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But the general point seems to me this: there is a moral asymmetry between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one's standpoint on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (a) issues where one's democratic representatives and their affiliates are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making decisions on one's behalf,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (not-a) choices made by people outside one's sphere of influence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If your deputy is acting in a way you regard as deplorable, it's up to you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to speak out. If someone over in the next town or nation is doing so, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might take a keen interest, but you generally have a lesser moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; responsibility to speak out.
</em><br>
<p>Absurd, this is the kind of twisted ethics prevalent on the extropy board
<br>
that alienates me.  You are basically saying that the more an act directly
<br>
affects your life, the more you are morally required to speak out against
<br>
it.  Bullshit.  The more an act morally desecrates sentient life, freedom,
<br>
and progress the more your morally responsible to speak out against it.  You
<br>
perpetuate this &quot;As long as Im ok, who cares about anyone else&quot; attitude
<br>
that is regressive and non-extropian, although you hide it under the guise
<br>
of a higher moral principle, the duty to criticize ones own state over the
<br>
rest of the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Australian, British or US decision makers act, allegedly in my behalf,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's far more urgent that I take stock of their actions and speak
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up for or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against their choices. If someone in Vietnam, where I have no stake or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control at all, acts abominably, I might speak up as a concerned, distant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; observer, but the moral situation is rather different, I think.
</em><br>
<p>The *moral* situation is rather different?!  Seems to me murder is just as
<br>
wrong whether perpetrated by a stranger in a distant land or by your mayor.
<br>
It is, in fact, the extent which these dealings affect your daily life that
<br>
dictates the level of moral outrage with which you regard such actions and
<br>
not the intrisnic horrors of the actions.   I dont see how the flagrant
<br>
moral abandoment of murder and enslavement *matters* whether or not those
<br>
who make those flagrant moral aggreivances are a representative of you.  Its
<br>
a convenient excuse to not care.  We are all human beings, we must value all
<br>
life, not just our own, and not just those lucky enough to share our own
<br>
benign leaders.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; When I hear that Saddam and his sons and regime tortured and murdered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, I am horrified; when I hear that US jails contain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prisoners many of them incarcerated for using marijuana and subjected in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prison to rampant rape and brutality, I am horrified as well.
</em><br>
<p>...but are you equally horrified? !!!!!!!!
<br>
<p>Are you seriously suggesting it is equally deplorable that humans beings are
<br>
being raped, murdered, and tortured as you find human beings spending a few
<br>
months in climate controlled prison watching survivor, weight lifting and
<br>
reading Playboy in a post industrialized west nation living longer healther
<br>
better lives than perhaps 3/4's of the world?  Yet again I find myself
<br>
feeling deep visceral disgust to an extropian's concept of ethics.  You
<br>
should be speaking out against things in proportion to the horror of the
<br>
actions.
<br>
<p>If you do not find it equally delporable, which do you find more deplorable,
<br>
and which do you speak out more vehemently against?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
