<em>&gt; &gt; And this provides a semi-seque to my ideas about where opportunity may 
</em><br>
lie 
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for Westerners if the outsourcing and race to the bottom dynamics 
</em><br>
continue: 
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; immigration reciprocity may provide a place for small time American 
</em><br>
business 
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people to immigration at least temporarily overseas to 3rd world 
</em><br>
countries 
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; where their savings would afford them much more ability to operate a 
</em><br>
business.
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem for small business in many third world countries is not lack
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of capital - otherwise they would do no better when they come to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United States.  The problem is regulation.  Most third world countries
</em><br>
<em>&gt; struggle with a bewildering maze of regulatory restrictions, applied at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple levels.  Hernando de Soto shows in one of his books the enormous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of steps necessary to start a business - it was something like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 500 different contacts and approvals that had to be made.  You had to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; talk to the locality, the city, the state, the national government,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and a variety of special boards and commissions within each grouping.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Add to this the widespread corruption and demands for bribes and it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; creates an enormous burden for the would-be small businessman.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As a result, many or most small businesses are &quot;informal&quot;, i.e. illegal,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and are constantly in danger of being shut down.  They can't get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too successful or grow too big, or they will draw the attention of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the authorities.  You end up with a bunch of famly-run shops and services
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which can barely make ends meet.
</em><br>
<p><p><p>Yes, I am aware of the problem. In Mexico, many or most businesses are 
<br>
illegal. But no one seems to care, unless you are a foreigner.  Yes, in some 
<br>
parts of Latin America, and some parts of Asia, and in all of Africa, the 
<br>
govts are into full blown, brazen, leech mode.  Those govts and the govt 
<br>
workers see the citizens as their chattel.  And the bureaucracies are so 
<br>
Byzantine and entrenched that no amount of immigration reciprocity 
<br>
negotiations on the part of the Western powers (particularly America) could 
<br>
begin to reform them.  
<br>
<p>Here is an example of the chaos in Nigeria :
