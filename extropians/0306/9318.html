NACCTS asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;The  core  of  my  ramblings is this: Isn't it a natural proccess that there  should always be superiors and inferiors? Or else how can there be  any  evolution/progress? If all entities were equal, wouldn't that mean   stagnancy   and  eventually  enthropy?  Evolution,  the  way  I understand  it,  involves  changes,  differences.  I don't want to get into  an  argument about racial discrimination, far from that. But I'm thinking  about  Nietzsche and the Overman. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>First, my feeble understanding of the modern understanding of evolution is that when Darwin said &quot;Survival of the Fitest&quot; he did not mean the strongest; he mean't the most successfully adaptive. If strong is what is needed to succeed, fine; if running or flying like a bat out of hell works well enough, so you can breed and pass along your traits. also good.
<br>
<p>As for humans, I suspect that what succeeds for humans is not only academic skills, but social competition. The most agressive and assertive persons, who possess people skills and the ability to hire good speech writers and policy makers and deliver said speeches, is what these Republics we live in are all about.
<br>
<p>The most intellectually gifted in astronomy, for example, are not at the exact head of the chow-line. I mean, astronomers do well enough, and love what they do, but their paychecks do not match that of Corporation CEO's (Pre-Prison income only!)
<br>
<p>The real fun will begin, later in this century when People Helpers (A.I. Proggies) start to assist folks in making life decisions; some of which will be business decisions, and yes, who to vote against. Later implementations will surely include some kind of brain-pc interface, that one caries around-no typing or speaking necessary.  
<br>
<p>This will certainly up-end the social system, because people who follow sound advice, usually wind up smelling like a rose.
<br>
Will the Rich race to supply themselves with uber brains to keep them on top, restrict use of such devices to themselves? People who are integrated with super A.I's will be a force to reckon, in themselves. They are BORG! Or at least people who won't be horn-swoggled.

I've  been  thinking  that  animal evolution resides in the old jungle
<br>
law:  the  survival  of the fittest. And this is well reflected in the
<br>
supposedly civilised/superior humanity.
<br>
<p>It's  still  all about the domination of the strongest entity (whether
<br>
individual  or  group).  And  that  applies  to  any  human  field. By
<br>
strongest,  of  course  I  don't  imply  only  physical  strength  but
<br>
everything that can provide any edge over others.
<br>
<p>The  core  of  my  ramblings is this: Isn't it a natural proccess that
<br>
there  should always be superiors and inferiors? Or else how can there
<br>
be  any  evolution/progress? If all entities were equal, wouldn't that
<br>
mean   stagnancy   and  eventually  enthropy?  Evolution,  the  way  I
<br>
understand  it,  involves  changes,  differences.  I don't want to get
<br>
into  an  argument about racial discrimination, far from that. But I'm
<br>
thinking  about  Nietzsche and the Overman. If we want to evolve, does
<br>
that  mean  that  at  some  time, we will have to consider the rest of
<br>
humanity       as       inferiors       (lower       on       the
<br>
intellectual/emotional/physical/etc  chain)?   How  does that fit into
<br>
our ethical code of conduct?
<br>
<p>I hope that I'm making myself clear enough.  :)
