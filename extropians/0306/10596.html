<a href="mailto:paatschb@optusnet.com.au?Subject=Re:%20Offlist%20%20%20Re:%20List%20Moderator%20Suggestions">paatschb@optusnet.com.au</a> writes: Yourself ;-), Hal, Harvey, Eliezer (has experience), Greg, 
<br>
Steve Davies, all good candidates.  There might be a number of others that 
<br>
might be sufficiently invested in the health of the list and concerned to do the 
<br>
job well to grow into a job they may not have a natural flair for.  Say Lee 
<br>
Corbin? and perhaps me, but the workload scares me and its no fun doing any 
<br>
sort of policing work or umpiring.  If you really wanted to experiment will what 
<br>
a bit of responsibility might do how about Ron, Mike and Sam ;-)
<br>
<p>Brett,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A theory has been going around this list that the list is operated by 
<br>
a clique.  To this date I have resisted the theory and denied its validity.  I 
<br>
did this partially just because I didn't want to believe its truth.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My personal belief was that a majority that closely shared the same 
<br>
political convictions was warring with anyone that attempted to maintain any 
<br>
position to the contrary.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The distinction I was making was the one made by Gatto.  Gatto states 
<br>
that a conspiracy is not necessary when a group with the same bias exists.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can live with a Gatto type situation but you have gone a long way to 
<br>
convince me I was wrong.  If your suggestions were carried out I would be 
<br>
convinced that a politically biased group was formally in charge of the Extropian 
<br>
list.  Of course this would no longer be an Extropian group should that come 
<br>
to pass.
<br>
Ron h.
