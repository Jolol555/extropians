</em><br>
<em>&gt; expect to live an ordinary lifespan, who have the usual goals that most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people do, and who have the usual expectations about future trends, your 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolution has given them, a standard mix of wanting food, status, 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that different from the social world that evolution expects, at least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regarding these issues.  Given those assumptions, it seems quite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable for them to &quot;Just be Natural.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>The argument that is accessible to anyone is Just Be Rational, Or The 
<br>
Unknown Variables Will Eat You.  We know a couple of what are, from the 
<br>
majority perspective, unknown unknowns, and we can confirm that the 
<br>
presence of those unknown unknowns does in fact operate to reinforce the 
<br>
rule and create nonobvious incentives for rationality.  But on new cases, 
<br>
the argument is the same for us as for anyone else.  We don't know all the 
<br>
unknown unknowns either.
<br>
<p>In any case, we should distinguish between the question of whether the 
<br>
right answer is Just Be Rational, and the question of how persuasive the 
<br>
right answer happens to be.  People are playing the game for enormous, 
<br>
nonancestral stakes, even in their own lives, whether they realize it or 
<br>
not.  How wonderful that the Just Be Rational strategy, accessible to any 
<br>
audience, returns the right answer even in the face of such tremendous 
<br>
surprises!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now I actually do think that the world our descendants will live in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within the next century may well be different enough that acting with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the usual level of self-deception may lead to very bad outcomes.  So I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally can accept this as a strong argument for seeking truth.  (And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I even once had this argument in my self-deception paper.)  But for most 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; audiences, this is a very weak argument.  And my original claim was just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I could only find disappointingly weak arguments for believing truth.
</em><br>
<p>The universal argument is &quot;Just be rational or you won't even see the 
<br>
bullet that kills you.&quot;  We know several specific instances of such 
<br>
bullets that are not widely known, which shows that the universal argument 
<br>
has turned out to work so far; as we accumulate additional experience and 
<br>
knowledge, it tends to show that the heuristic was correct.  Speaking from 
<br>
my experience, this heuristic not only turned out to lead to the correct 
<br>
answer, in retrospect it often seems like this heuristic is the only 
<br>
possible way for a human to arrive at the correct answer without 
<br>
anachronistic advance knowledge.
<br>
<p>If you are worried about finding disappointingly weak *arguments* for 
<br>
rationality, *arguments* as opposed to *rational support*, then that is 
<br>
quite a different question from the one I thought you were asking.  I'm 
<br>
worried that quantum mechanics also has disappointingly weak arguments 
<br>
relative to a layman audience; for example, it lacks the dramatic appeal 
<br>
and intuitive animism of elephants on the back of a giant turtle.  But 
<br>
that is a question of needing to write lengthy explanations, not of the 
<br>
principle itself being wrong.
<br>
<p>But I don't think JBR is, in fact, inaccessible.  The Just Be Rational 
<br>
strategy is not only employable by anyone, it has arguments which are 
<br>
accessible to anyone - as widely available as the nutritionless package of 
<br>
fat and sugar at the grocery store, the history of scientific discovery, 
<br>
the innate drive to know the truth.  The list of reasons I originally 
<br>
offered were simply put; only the replies to your complex counterarguments 
<br>
were complex.  Truthseeking is a simple and intuitive idea.  The idea that 
<br>
we execute adaptive self-deception is a complex counterargument.  A box of 
<br>
Little Debbie snack bars is a simple but iffy illustration of the complex 
<br>
reply to the complex counterargument; the Singularity is a more valid 
<br>
illustration, but less accessible.
