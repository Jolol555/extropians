<p><em> &gt;The real question is, would their task have been significantly harder
</em><br>
<em> &gt;without the facilities in Afghanistan?  I doubt it.
</em><br>
<p>Do you? I don't. Even if you're a crazy fundamentalist you are not going to
<br>
crash an airliner into a skyscraper just because I say so unless you are
<br>
convinced my plan will work and am some sort of a superior human being who
<br>
should be followed. To do that I need to isolate you from the rest of the
<br>
world and indoctrinate you, and to do that I need at least one secure base,
<br>
and to do that I need state support. They didn't go to Afghanistan to get a
<br>
tan I can tell you that.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Iraq wasn't a substantially terror-supporting state.
</em><br>
<p>That's the beauty of it! The message is clear, if you are a evil
<br>
totalitarian state you had better do your damn best to make sure the USA is
<br>
not hit by another 911 because guilty or innocent you will be blamed for it
<br>
and I guarantee you that will not be healthy.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;John, would you be so blasé if every person in the world had a global
</em><br>
<em> &gt;destruct button they could push?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not blasé, I know it's a terrible problem but I also know that making
<br>
nice to Islam will not reduce their anger one iota because the root cause of
<br>
that anger was not any specific action committed by the west. They are angry
<br>
at us for what we are not what we did. They would be less angry if the
<br>
foundation of the west was some dogma, even some dogma they didn't like,
<br>
instead it is based on free markets and pragmatic problem solving and that
<br>
frightens and angers them. They would be less angry if our system didn't
<br>
work very well but we're rich free and powerful and they are poor oppressed
<br>
and weak. 800 years ago Islam was the most advanced civilization on Earth
<br>
but its been straight downhill since, today they are not even second or
<br>
third but dead last; we have the word of The Profit so it can't be our
<br>
fault, it must be due to those evil westerners, our only mistake was
<br>
embracing too many 16'th century ideas, we should go back to 13'th century
<br>
ideas.
<br>
<p>Sure all that anger is dangerous and needs to be defused, I'm not sure what
<br>
will work but I am sure what won't work, starting a be kind to terrorists
<br>
policy will not work.
