</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can you say it is not intelligent to sell a stock when you have good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason to believe it is going to drop in price? If you had 4,000 shares of
</em><br>
a
<br>
<em>&gt; biotech stock like ImClone, and you had good reason to believe the FDA was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about to reject its flagship anti-cancer drug, then wouldn't you do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything possible to get out of the stock?
</em><br>
<p>I did not say it was not intelligent to sell a stock that may be dropping in
<br>
price.  I said it was not a good idea (therefore not smart) to enter a stock
<br>
position without a stop in place (sometimes this is called a stop loss, or a
<br>
stop limit, although the latter will execute your sell order only at the
<br>
number you indicate, and not a penny over or under as with a the former
<br>
stop, which will turn your stock into a market sell at your specified
<br>
price).
<br>
<p>That's what a stop is for - to limit your losses.  Stops are not just for
<br>
stocks where you have reason to believe it is going to drop in price ... it
<br>
is a good idea to use stops when entering ANY stock position (after
<br>
determining what percentage loss one is willing to take on the stock).
<br>
Then, should the stock prove profitable, the stops can be moved up to trail
<br>
the profits until you are ready to sell.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can say it is never intelligent to break the law, but the law itself
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; what is in dispute here.
</em><br>
<p>There are many reasons why there are laws - for one thing, to protect
<br>
investors somewhat (and even with what laws we have, the market makers have
<br>
many more advantages than investors in manipulating stock prices and
<br>
&quot;knowing&quot; things earlier than investors and traders).  But I was
<br>
specifically talking about investment strategies, and not disputing the law.
<br>
I trade for a living, so I'm a little more knowledgeable about what
<br>
investors need to do - and Martha failed to do them, it seems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Too early to tell what the judgment will be, but from what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; understand there is NO RECORD of Martha's instructions to her broker
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about the stop loss PRIOR to the day in question
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, order entry should be completely computerized now at Merrill. It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; half-way computerized when I left the firm more than ten years ago. Even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before computerization the stop-loss order would have been on record with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the firm's office at the NYSE.
</em><br>
<p>But that's what I was addressing.  If Martha used a stop loss the day or
<br>
night before the IMCLE drop, then it would look suspicious (especially,
<br>
considering she had other positions, if she was not in the habit of having
<br>
stop losses on her other stocks).  If she put that stop loss in when she got
<br>
bought IMCLE, that would have been better.  Then she could have said she put
<br>
that stop loss in as soon as she bought the stock - as a matter of course -
<br>
because that's how she practices money management.  But Martha apparently
<br>
didn't, and her timing drew suspicion.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A legitimate stop-loss order would be on the record somewhere -- not just
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; the broker's handwritten notes -- but I'm not disputing the unethical
</em><br>
nature
<br>
<em>&gt; of the cover-up. I'm disputing the wisdom of the law that says she had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something to cover up.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I was talking mostly about stocks and investment strategies - as
<br>
that's my forte.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The burden of proof will be on Martha to prove that this transaction
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was similar to her other stock transactions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The burden of proof is never on the accused.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I understand what you're saying.  But what I meant was that if
<br>
Martha's stop loss was timely (on record before there was any talk of the
<br>
stock's dropping), and if there's an electronic record of it, then Martha
<br>
would have a good case that she was simply practicing good financial
<br>
management.
