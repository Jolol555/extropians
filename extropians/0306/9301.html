Los Angeles Times News Service, Via The Dallas Morning News, 1 June 2003
<br>
By Milton Viorst
<br>
<p>Iraq's Shiites, 60 percent of the population, most of them fervently 
<br>
religious, have stunned U.S. officials who gave us the war to 
<br>
overthrow Saddam Hussein.  Not only do the Shiites reject our 
<br>
occupation, but they also dismiss the Western-style democracy that we 
<br>
were assured they would welcome.
<br>
<p>It took hardly more than recent full-color pictures in newspapers and 
<br>
on television of Shiite men flagellating themselves until blood 
<br>
streamed from their flesh to make the case that we are dealing with 
<br>
people we don't know.  Ironically, Saddam's regime had barred 
<br>
self-flagellation as barbaric.  For believers, his fall did not mean 
<br>
freedom to adopt a constitution and elect a parliament; it meant 
<br>
freedom to suffer the stings of whips for a martyr who died 13 
<br>
centuries ago and to demand an Islamic state.
<br>
<p>When communism died at the end of the 1980s, Vaclav Havel, the poet 
<br>
who became president of Czechoslovakia, declared that &quot;democratic 
<br>
values slumbered in the subconscious of our nations&quot;.  His words 
<br>
suggest that these nations waited only for the sunshine of spring to 
<br>
awake to the democracy that had lain dormant within them.  Indeed, 
<br>
societies liberated from communism, including Russia, navigated the 
<br>
currents of Western values to adopt democratic systems, though they 
<br>
sometimes perilously scraped the rocks.  So did the European 
<br>
countries delivered from fascism after World War II -- Italy and 
<br>
Germany, then Spain and Portugal.
<br>
<p>But democratic values do not slumber in the subconscious of the 
<br>
Islamic world.  Free elections threaten to bring religious extremists 
<br>
to power in Egypt, Jordan, Pakistan and even Turkey, which has been 
<br>
working at democracy for nearly a century.  Were free elections held 
<br>
in Saudi Arabia, fanatics would surely triumph.  In 1992, elections 
<br>
brought Algeria to the edge of Islamic rule, triggering a civil war 
<br>
that still rages.  Given the substantial divisions in Iraq's 
<br>
population, and the power of religion within its Shiite majority, 
<br>
free elections there would probably produce the same outcome.
<br>
<p>Years ago, I asked an elderly philosopher in Damascus, Syria, to 
<br>
explain the difficulty Arabs have in mastering democracy, and he 
<br>
answered, ruefully: &quot;The Islamic world never had a Renaissance.&quot; 
<br>
What he meant, I later understood, was that the steps toward 
<br>
secularism that Western society first took in mid-millennium are yet 
<br>
to be taken -- or, at best, have been taken only hesitantly -- within 
<br>
Islam.
<br>
<p>The seminal notion that the Renaissance introduced to the West was 
<br>
that mankind, not God, is at the hub of the social universe.  It held 
<br>
reason to be as important as faith, and urged men and women to claim 
<br>
responsibility, free of clergy, for their own lives.
<br>
<p>Under the influence of texts from ancient Greece, Muslims in their 
<br>
Golden Age considered and rejected these ideas before passing the 
<br>
texts on to Europe.  After triggering the Renaissance, the ideas led, 
<br>
over quarrelsome centuries, to the Reformation, the Enlightenment and 
<br>
the Scientific Revolution.  While Islam remained wedded to desert 
<br>
tradition, Europe created a civilization imbued with a sense of 
<br>
individual identity, in which men and women asserted rights apart 
<br>
from those of the community.  These ideas, for better or worse, 
<br>
became the foundation of the secular culture that characterizes 
<br>
Western civilization today.
<br>
<p>Religion by no means disappeared.  Instead, it was redefined as a 
<br>
personal bond, a relationship of choice, between the individual and 
<br>
God.  The redefinition made Westerners comfortable separating worship 
<br>
from the state.  True, segments of the Catholic Church, Orthodox 
<br>
Jewry and evangelical Protestantism still question this arrangement. 
<br>
But the secular idea constitutes the foundation of mainstream Western 
<br>
values.  Without it, democracy -- and the civil society that, along 
<br>
with the press, supports it -- would be impossible.
<br>
<p>This process has largely bypassed Islamic society.  Muslims like to 
<br>
say that &quot;Islam isn't just a religion; it's a way of life.&quot;  What 
<br>
they mean is that there is no barrier between faith and the everyday 
<br>
world, between what is sacred and what is profane.  It is not so much 
<br>
that Muslims are more pious than Westerners.  It is that the 
<br>
imperatives of the culture impose limits on diversity of outlook, 
<br>
whether religious or social.  These imperatives suppress the demand 
<br>
for personal identity, leaving believers with little tolerance for 
<br>
the free and open debate necessarily at democracy's core.
<br>
<p>Ironically, Saddam's Baath regime once promised to introduce Iraq to 
<br>
secularism.  It went further than any other Arab state in 
<br>
emancipating women, curbing clerical power, promoting literature and 
<br>
arts and advancing universal literacy within a framework of modern 
<br>
education.  Its tragedy is that these seeds of democracy were 
<br>
subsumed under the world's most brutal tyranny, crushing their human 
<br>
potential.  After 1,400 years of Islamic conservatism and 25 of 
<br>
Saddam, there is little likelihood that a disposition to democracy 
<br>
slumbers in Iraq's psyche.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From President Bush on down, officials who are presiding over the 
<br>
rebuilding of Iraq would be wise to remember that the values at our 
<br>
system's heart have been a thousand years in the making.  No doubt 
<br>
Iraq's Shiite majority is happy at Hussein's downfall, but American 
<br>
lectures on the virtues of replacing him with democratic rule fall on 
<br>
uncomprehending ears.  So much must first be done to lay a groundwork 
<br>
of individual freedom and responsibility, values that Iraqis must 
<br>
willingly embrace.
<br>
<p>At the moment, the majority is more comfortable with the familiar 
<br>
idea of Islamic government.  The U.S. administration's vision of a 
<br>
Middle East reshaped by Western democracy, starting with Iraq, is 
<br>
naive and, moreover, delusive.
