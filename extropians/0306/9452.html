I want to clarify something I wrote, because I think it was misinterpreted
<br>
and that led to further commentary that was off base.
<br>
<p>I had written:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Again, no one is postulating that we live in a simulation.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a conclusion, which should not be confused with a premise.
</em><br>
<p>and Harvey replied:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this will be news to most people reading this list.  Many of them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think that Bostrom has lead them to the conclusion that we are &quot;more likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than not&quot; to be inside a simulation.  If people want to reduce their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; position to say that there is a small but unproven chance that we might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in a simulation, I would have no objection.
</em><br>
<p>Then Rafal commented, and things spun off.  The problem is that in
<br>
my comment, I meant to emphasize the word &quot;postulating&quot;.  No one is
<br>
POSTULATING that we live in a simulation.  That means, no one is assuming
<br>
it or taking it as a starting point.  Rather, they are CONCLUDING that
<br>
we (likely) live in a simulation.  A conclusion is the end of a chain of
<br>
reasoning; a postulate is the beginning.  They are completely different,
<br>
which is what I was saying in my second sentence.
<br>
<p>However, Harvey read me differently, to be saying that NO ONE was saying
<br>
that we lived in a simulation.  That's not true; I do think there are
<br>
people who are persuaded enough by the Simulation Argument that they
<br>
think there is a good chance that we are living in a simulation.  I did
<br>
not mean to say or imply that supporters of the SA are only taking the
<br>
weak position that the chance that we live in a simulation is small.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, in my discussion with Harvey, I don't think I was able to
<br>
get across the distinction I was trying to make.  It is absolutely crucial
<br>
to distinguish between premises and conclusions when reasoning logically.
<br>
You can attack a premise directly; but to attack a conclusion, you have
<br>
to go back to the premises (or logic) of the argument which produced
<br>
that conclusion.
<br>
<p>Deriving outlandish conclusions from plausible premises is the greatest
<br>
gift which we can receive from Logic.  I feel that the DA and SA are
<br>
marvelous examples of this phenomenon.
<br>
