<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course that raises the question of why believing in the truth should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; have such an overwhelming importance, moral or otherwise.  Some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; plausibly argue that it is more moral to be loyal to one's group, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; if this means that your beliefs will be biased, just as they believe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; is more moral to give charity to members of your group, even if this
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; think that there are few things more important than believing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; truth, I can offer only disappointingly weak moral arguments to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Here are some of my favorite answers:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;     * &quot;Because I value the truth as a thing in itself.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's a statement of the position, not an argument for it.
</em><br>
<p>Mm, no, I'd call it a refinement of the position.  I.e., one can value the 
<br>
truth as either a means or an ends; this refines the statement by focusing 
<br>
on ends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;     * &quot;If the sky is blue, it's blue.  If I think that's true, how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; could I believe something else just because I wanted to?  That's not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; how my mind is wired.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then your brain is different from most humans.  As with patriotism, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humans are in fact wired to be biased in many ways, and we have to work 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to overcome those biases.  Of course we don't believe we are biased, but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that doesn't stop us from being biased to believe things we want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe.  Honestly, I think it must be the same with you; you'd like to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe you are different, but you are not.
</em><br>
<p>I think most humans are wired such that, standing under a clear blue sky, 
<br>
they would find it at least a little difficult to say and believe the sky 
<br>
is green.  This is what I was speaking of.  It takes considerable training 
<br>
to overcome that innate honesty.  In ambiguous matters, or where there is 
<br>
political controversy, things are different.  There is a certain capacity 
<br>
to believe what one wants to believe, but it's not unlimited.  It would 
<br>
take me a tremendous amount of work to rearrange my mind such that I could 
<br>
believe the sky was green, if I could do it at all, and I expect the same 
<br>
would be true of most people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;     * &quot;Because knowing the truth is the best and only means of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; achieving the goals I care about.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To judge whether this is true, we need to know more about the goals you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care about.
</em><br>
<p>How would a goal get achieved without a Bayesian decisionmaking system to 
<br>
implement it?  (Not a perfect Bayesian decision process; a process which, 
<br>
to the extent it works, works because it has Bayesian structure somewhere 
<br>
in it.)  How would a Bayesian decisionmaking process work without 
<br>
containing Bayesian reasoning on beliefs?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;     * &quot;Because even the process whereby I *decide* my goals depends on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; finding the actual answers (as opposed to the comforting or convenient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; answers) to logical or factual questions.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People *can* choose comforting or convenient goals.  For example, a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; common argument against moral consequentialism is that it is too much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work to figure out the consequences of your actions for all people over 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all time.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but do you want goals that are *really* comforting or convenient, or 
<br>
just goals that you *think* are comforting and convenient?  In other 
<br>
words, if you are computing the &quot;convenience&quot; of a goal, do you want an 
<br>
accurate result for that computation - the really genuinely true result 
<br>
for that computation - or will you be satisfied with a convenient answer 
<br>
to that computation?  In the latter case, I would guess that your goals 
<br>
will end up not being really convenient at all; but perhaps it will be, 
<br>
though not *really* convenient to believe your goals are more convenient 
<br>
than they are, at least convenient to believe that it is convenient to 
<br>
believe that your goals are more convenient than they are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;     * &quot;Because if I wrapped myself up in a private world, severing my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; connection to outside reality, I would destroy my potential to grow as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a person.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are clearly lots of ways to grow that do not depend on close times 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to outside reality.
</em><br>
<p>Name one?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;     * &quot;Darn, I don't have enough knowledge to answer that question.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I'd better go get some.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most people answer such questions without much of any knowledge.
</em><br>
<p>Just because you can answer a question without any knowledge, does not 
<br>
mean that you should.  For any person who is aware of their own lack of 
<br>
knowledge, and who regards that as a bad thing, the above would seem to be 
<br>
a valid argument.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;     * &quot;Because without accurate knowledge, I'd have no way of knowing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; how dangerous it was to be ignorant.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Most of us make most of the important decisions in our lives without 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate knowledge of their dangers.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, with consequences that are instrumentally negative under a wide 
<br>
variety of ends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; An instrumental justification of seeking truth seems bound to run into 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations where it harms other goals more than it helps.  For example, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if you want a happy marriage you might do better to not know too much 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how unhappy most marriages end up, or how similarly happy you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might have been with the other spouses you could have chosen.  Probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simpler to just declare truth-seeking as a strong primary goal.
</em><br>
<p>Simpler, sure.  And you are safer, in your pursuit of rationality, if your 
<br>
love of the truth is strong enough in itself to overcome any temptations 
<br>
to depart.  But that does not mean that there is not more than one 
<br>
argument that locks the truth into place.  Also, I don't consider 
<br>
convenience alone as a valid argument for choosing primary ends, so it's 
<br>
lucky that I do in fact happen to have truth as a primary end.
