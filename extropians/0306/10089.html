<p>Well, first, the three items I put forward are put forward
<br>
mainly at this point to be criticized, or re-worked.  But
<br>
thanks for the encouragement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I agree with both Lee and Greg and have tried, at least much of
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes.  On reflecting on what appeared to be one sarcastic response
<br>
to my note, it occurred to me that not only do we (positively)
<br>
share our thoughts on this list, but (positively?) share our 
<br>
feelings.  Now as our feelings, it turns out, are an integral
<br>
part of our thinking (Damiaso et. al.), &quot;rant modes&quot; and sarcastic
<br>
responses can be seen in a positive light:  they are efforts to
<br>
share our often internal lower level unfinished thoughts too.  Yet
<br>
somehow this kind of sharing, while informative, for some reasons
<br>
is often unproductive.
<br>
<p>But then Robert goes on to discuss (following Greg's lead, alas),
<br>
the Iraq war in *this* thread.
<br>
<p>As threads such as this are aimed at appealing to the most non-
<br>
partisan parts of our consciousness, I think that that's bad slip.
<br>
I too want to say what I think (and perhaps even what I feel) about
<br>
the war, but when I've caught up to all the discussion, I'll
<br>
go into &quot;partisan mode&quot; there.  Certainly ideological remarks
<br>
ought never to be made in META threads.
<br>
<p>Lee
