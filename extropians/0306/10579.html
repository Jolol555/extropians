</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>It's a Bayesian answer to a most un-Bayesian question.  We do not want the 
<br>
probability of our theory P(T) to be as high as possible.  Seriously.  We 
<br>
don't.  There is no &quot;our&quot; theory in rational thinking.  We want P(T) to be 
<br>
whatever P(T) really should be.  We do not want to argue *for* P(T), we 
<br>
want to equably assemble all the evidence for and against T.  This being 
<br>
the case, I as a human find it quite highly suspicious when people try to 
<br>
have their cake and eat it too.
<br>
<p>It moreover follows from Bayes' Theorem that if B is evidence for T, then 
<br>
~B *must* be evidence against T - you *cannot* have your cake and eat it too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let's suppose I agree with you that any theory T for which P(T|B) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; P(T|~B) are both high is less &quot;constrained by the territory&quot; than an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternate theory T', under which P(T'|B) = P(T|B), but P(T'|~B) is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; low.  T' is constrained by the territory.  T is less constrained by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; territory.  Are you trying to tell me, against Bayes, that we should hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; T' to be more likely than T, because T is &quot;mere philosophy&quot; whereas T' is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;constrained by the facts&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>Nope!  Reality has no preference one way or the other.  Therefore neither 
<br>
should our theories.  If T and T' start out being mostly equal, then in 
<br>
the situation you name, we should slightly prefer T to T'.  *However* this 
<br>
is because the prior probability of T' starts out lower, and then, if we 
<br>
observe B, this will be evidence about T' which raises it to the around 
<br>
the level already occupied by T; however we haven't observed B yet.  You 
<br>
cannot say that both B and ~B are arguments for T - that is not possible. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The most you can say is that T is about evenly compatible with B and ~B 
<br>
such that B does not interact much with T and is not evidence about T one 
<br>
way or the other.  Interpreting P(T|B) and P(T|~B) as &quot;high&quot; does not mean 
<br>
that both B and ~B are strong arguments for T; this is *impossible*.  It 
<br>
can only mean that the prior probability of T is high and that B is not 
<br>
much additional evidence one way or the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But that's not at all the case in my T &amp; T' example, by construction, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it doesn't apply to our &quot;Why believe the truth&quot; argument either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nobody's saying that we shouldn't consider the probability of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Singularity [P(T|B)] in our calculations.  But we ARE saying that a theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that applies well to Singularitarians and non-Singularitarians alike is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better theory, more likely to be true, than a theory that applies equally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well to Singularitarians but not at all to non-Singularitarians, ceteris
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paribus.
</em><br>
<p>The key word is that &quot;ceteris paribus&quot;.  It never is.  Ceteris paribus, 
<br>
what you are saying is true, but ceteris is only paribus if you just 
<br>
happened to stumble across two theories T and T' and you're wondering 
<br>
vaguely which of them is more accurate.  This business of trying to 
<br>
deliberately assemble evidence *for* a theory is never Bayesian.  You are 
<br>
just trying to sum up all the support and anti-support you run across.  If 
<br>
it happens to support the theory, great, but you can never *try* to make a 
<br>
theory stronger by *trying* to show it is compatible with ~B if that is 
<br>
not a natural way for the theory to work.  It may be natural, in which 
<br>
case fine, but you can never try and force it.  Proving the theory is 
<br>
never a goal, so there is no reason to cheer if P(T|~B) turns out to be high.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, dropping back into anthropomorphism, and remembering the 
<br>
consilient division of labor, whoever is investigating B will probably be 
<br>
most displeased if we try and make T fit every possible value of B.  And 
<br>
the fact that it is even possible to try and &quot;make&quot; T fit means that we 
<br>
are inventing hot air.
