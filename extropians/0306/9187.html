</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anthropic Principle argues against the first assumption in the Simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Argument.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good point, but there are a couple of counters.  First, among
<br>
the vast amount of literature on the Doomsday Argument (DA) there do
<br>
exist various counter-arguments, which I must confess go somewhat over
<br>
my head.  Nick talks about the &quot;Self-Indication Axiom&quot; which can work
<br>
against the DA.  So you don't necessarily have to accept the DA even
<br>
though you might believe the Simulation Argument (SA).
<br>
<p>Second, even if you accept the DA, we might still squeeze in quite a bit
<br>
of simulating before the end.  The DA basically says that we're &quot;typical&quot;.
<br>
Well, as I understand it, approximately 10% of all humans are alive today.
<br>
Put another way, about 10 times as many people have died as are alive.
<br>
If we are in the middle, then we'd expect history to last until another
<br>
~60 billion have died.  At current population and longevity levels,
<br>
that would be perhaps 500-1000 years in the future.  That is a very
<br>
rough prediction of our future longevity based on the DA, to within an
<br>
order of magnitude or so.  That's enough time that our technology will
<br>
probably advance to the point where we have super-advanced computing
<br>
and can perform enough simulations to give the SA some force.
<br>
<p>And third, the SA is actually an independent counter-argument to the DA.
<br>
Why are we here?  The DA says it's because we're roughly in the middle
<br>
of our species' lifetime.  But it could be that we're here because this
<br>
is the era that everyone likes to simulate the best - the Transition,
<br>
when humans went from animal to god.  It's plausible that this would
<br>
be an era which would be heavily investigated, and so it would be
<br>
over-represented in terms of probability of observer-moments.  In that
<br>
case our presence here and now could be consistent even with an enormously
<br>
long human future, which is otherwise unlikely given the DA.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The statistical counting of the universes to see which is most likely seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; weak to me.  There would be more dreams than realities and simulations.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this process made sense, shouldn't we conclude that we are in a dream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; instead of a simulation or a real universe?
</em><br>
<p>This is a commonly discussed question on the everything-list.
<br>
The consensus resolution is that simpler universes must be inherently
<br>
more probable.  To provide an overly concise explanation, this can be
<br>
justified by imagining that universes correspond to computer programs that
<br>
describe the &quot;laws of physics&quot; and initial conditions for that universe.
<br>
Finite length programs can be thought of as prefixes of infinite length
<br>
strings.  The measure of a program will be greater if it is shorter,
<br>
because then it is a prefix of proportionately more infinite strings.
<br>
Therefore shorter programs are of higher probability, and therefore
<br>
more lawful universes are inherently more probable.  Dreams and such
<br>
are chaotic and lack the internal consistency which the real world has,
<br>
hence such worlds would be less probable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I also question why different universes should be given equal weight in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistical probability that we would find ourselves therein.  Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realities exist for billions of years before the first simulations appear,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wouldn't that give realities a magnitude of more probability in these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calculations?
</em><br>
<p>That makes sense, although I think you might only want to count the
<br>
realities where observers like us exist.  Billions of years of existence
<br>
of a sterile universe would play no role in determining how likely an
<br>
observer is to appear in one place or another.  But if a real universe
<br>
held intelligent life for billions of years, that would count for a lot.
<br>
<p>You might rate a simulation or a reality in terms of person-years of
<br>
conscious existence.  A &quot;real&quot; universe like this one, which holds many
<br>
conscious observers for a long time, would have to be balanced by either
<br>
a sim which held as many people for as long, or by multiple sims which
<br>
had fewer people for a shorter period.
