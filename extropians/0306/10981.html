AOL has blocked e-mail from EarthLink several times, sometimes for days
<br>
before it was corrected. Their explanation was that their spam filters
<br>
kick in when a certain, undisclosed number of messages are received
<br>
simultaneously from a single IP. It didn't really have anything to do
<br>
with whether the server was an open relay (a mail server that will send
<br>
mail from any requestor) or not. None of the EarthLink servers were open
<br>
relays, although it is not inconceivable that a spammer might have sent
<br>
e-mail through one of their servers. AOL apparently just has a system
<br>
that is sensitive to volume, and that's the primary criterion it uses to
<br>
ID spam. When that threshold is breached, it blocks everything from the
<br>
sending IP, although sometimes they do appear to block specific domains
<br>
in the sender's address. A couple of years ago it took EarthLink ten
<br>
days to sort it out with AOL, so fixes don't necessarily happen quickly.
<br>
This isn't anything that unusual. AOL has a reputation for blocking
<br>
traffic from e-mail lists. Check out <a href="http://www.mailinglists.org/aol/">http://www.mailinglists.org/aol/</a>.

Subject: Re: META: aol.com is blocking all mail from extropy.org
<br>
<p><p>David,
<br>
<p><a href="http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#receiving">http://members.aol.com/adamkb/aol/mailfaq/#receiving</a>
<br>
<p>The Unofficial AOL Email FAQ notes this problem:
<br>
<p>Another error, which began appearing in the late summer of 2000, looks
<br>
like:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----- The following addresses had permanent fatal errors -----
<br>
&lt;<a href="mailto:screenname@aol.com?Subject=RE:%20META:%20aol.com%20is%20blocking%20all%20mail%20from%20extropy.org">screenname@aol.com</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;----- Transcript of session follows -----
<br>
... while talking to air-yg03.mail.aol.com.:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; RCPT To:&lt;<a href="mailto:screenname@aol.com?Subject=RE:%20META:%20aol.com%20is%20blocking%20all%20mail%20from%20extropy.org">screenname@aol.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
&lt;&lt;&lt; 550 DIRECT CONNECTION FROM DIAL-UP OR DYNAMIC-IP DENIED
<br>
550 &lt;<a href="mailto:screenname@aol.com?Subject=RE:%20META:%20aol.com%20is%20blocking%20all%20mail%20from%20extropy.org">screenname@aol.com</a>&gt;... User unknown
<br>
<p>In this case, the mail is being rejected because AOL believes it is 
<br>
being sent directly from someone's computer, rather than through their 
<br>
ISP's legitimate mail server, a common sign of malicious or abusive 
<br>
email. This can be fixed by them using a stable, legitimate mail server.
<br>
<p>---------------
<br>
<p>So AOL has decided it doesn't like extropy.org
<br>
<p>Further research at:
<br>
<a href="http://postmaster.info.aol.com/mailer.html">http://postmaster.info.aol.com/mailer.html</a>
<br>
<p>produces -
<br>
<p>550 - The IP address you're using to connect to AOL is either open to 
<br>
the free relaying of e-mail, is serving as an open proxy, or is a 
<br>
dynamic (residential) IP address.  AOL cannot accept further e-mail 
<br>
transactions from your server until either your server is closed to free
<br>
<p>relaying/proxy, or your ISP removes your IP address from their list of 
<br>
dynamic IP addresses. For additional information, please visit 
<br>
<a href="http://postmaster.info.aol.com">http://postmaster.info.aol.com</a>.
<br>
<p>If you are receiving the above bounce message, please check our Dial Up 
<br>
List search page, our open relay search page, and our open proxy search 
<br>
page to determine which of the above scenarios is causing your email
<br>
issue.
<br>
<p>-------------
<br>
<p>Your IP is not on the Dial Up List database. So the problem is probably 
<br>
&nbsp;on the AOL open relay list or the open proxy list.
<br>
<p>I can't check this as AOL will reply to your IP address, so go to
<br>
<a href="http://postmaster.info.aol.com/mailer.html">http://postmaster.info.aol.com/mailer.html</a>
<br>
<p>and you will probably be able to get closer to a solution.
<br>
<p>Best of luck, BillK
