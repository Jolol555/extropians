For those who aren't spiritual, this isn't a big leap. You are the
<br>
information, regardless of how it is stored.
<br>
For those who are spiritual, I suggest you figure out what a spirit is
<br>
composed of and upload that as well.

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The psychological problem that most people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; against uploading, of course, is that of &quot;being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; inside a computer&quot;, or of knowing that one is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; just on a silicon chip.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps its because I haven't read enough about it, but,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the reservation, I have against uploading, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cryonics is that I just not convinced that, appearances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not withstanding, the me that goes in, will be the me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that comes out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With cryonics, most people are concerned about the uncertainty of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology being able to adequately repair the damage, both pre-existing
</em><br>
age
<br>
<em>&gt; and disease-related, and the damage caused by the cryonic processes
</em><br>
itself.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it appears your concern is of more of a philosophical nature related
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; the nature of personal identity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps it is a bit different between uploading and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cryonics because uploading changes the matter substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on which one perceives one exists more radically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would have *much* more confidence in uploading to a more robust and high
</em><br>
<em>&gt; performance substrate compared to risking the damage of freezing and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restoring my biological substrate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let's stipulate that the means to do a complete atomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level recreation of all parts of a cryonically preserved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person, including the sense of self, and a consistent set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of memories from one's early childhood up until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moment one voluntarily consented to undergo a cryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; procedure. Like consenting to a life saving general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anaesthetic. Let's assume the nanotech is good enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to rebuild the exact atomic replica of person X.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you've duplicated the complete physical body, at some moment in time,
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; the atomic level.  To me, that appears to be sufficient, but I realize
</em><br>
many
<br>
<em>&gt; persons *feel* and suspect we are more than physical machines and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search for that something special in terms of quantum theory, mysticism,
</em><br>
or
<br>
<em>&gt; non-materialistic philosophy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My current sense is that, to everyone else person X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *will* appear to be the *same* person both before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and after. Person X prime, (Xprime), will perceive himself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be person X, but it seems to me that neither Xprime's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opinion, nor the opinions of other people are fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfactory when one puts oneself in the place of person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; X considering undergoing cryonics or uploading. It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that person X's predisposition to cryonics or uploading is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something of a leap of faith or perhaps the sense of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing little to lose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If X, and all his friends observe that he is the same in all measurable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ways, then what could be missing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; How can X know that Xprime is any more than a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complete copy? The same process that reproduced one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Xprime from the information in X could also produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; multiple copies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, the idea of multiple copies is outside our experience and threatening
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to our evolved sense of self, and raises some interesting questions of how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; society would deal with their presence, but I don't see anything
</em><br>
paradoxical
<br>
<em>&gt; about the concept.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let me try and use what seems to be an appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; analogy. A candle flame, 'energy' can be transferred or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spread from one candle (a matter substrate) to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without being extinguished. The flame might also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extinguished on the original substrate and relit. Or with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nanotechnology we may rebuilt a candle that, atom by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atom, is the same as the original candle and relight it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but the *particular* flame, the *particular* energy flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the substrate will still have been interrupted. Indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it will have been snuffed out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that &quot;death&quot; may be analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; candle flame (i.e. a continuous flow of energy dancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on a matter substrate). Because we eat and exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atoms throughout our lives the analogy could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extended to say wax is added to the candle whilst the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flame continues to burn. But, extinguish the flame, stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the continuous energy flow, and perhaps you extinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the continuing phenomena, the 'super-consciousness',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (to coin a term covering conscious and unconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processes) that are the subjective experience of life. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guess what I'm positing is that, one's life, one's self,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may depends on continuity. Perhaps something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important to the identity of a person is lost if the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flow or 'super-conscious' is interrupted. Actually the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness is interrupted sometimes in life but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; along with the unconscious so far as I know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People have been completely &quot;brain dead&quot; for significant periods of time
</em><br>
and
<br>
<em>&gt; then revived with no loss of personal identity.  (However it is open to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debate whether their soul got bored and departed.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not aware of anything physical that is truly continuous as you
</em><br>
describe
<br>
<em>&gt; it. If you look closely you see that pieces of the universe appear to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moving around in interesting patterns.  To me, the patterns carry all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, and are all that's really of interest.  A subset of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns is organized in such a way that it thinks it is separate, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perceives a &quot;self&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Following a successful cryonics procedure everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; including the reconstructed X, Xprime, thinks X has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been preserved, this I freely concede. But X the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; original, is no longer around or in a position to confirm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that X the original, X's super-consciousness, X's self,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than an excellent replication has actually emerged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, does it finally come down to a &quot;leap of faith&quot; on behalf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the potential cryonaut or the potential upload that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *they*, X, will *actually* survive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But why does it matter?  There's no need for a leap of faith if everything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works as before.  Your X-prime would know this intuitively.  He would be
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; same as before, and much more the same person than he was a week ago, or a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; year ago, or 20 years ago.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Or, and this I would like to be convinced of, are there in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fact deeper levels of understanding still available to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inquiring mind, *this* side of the cryonics or upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; procedure, perhaps in physics, or perhaps around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (or avoiding) the fuzzy phenomenon I've termed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; super-conscious, that would allow one to more rationally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; avoid the sense that the prospective cryonaut or upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are undertaking a one way journey that is in many ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; every bit as much a &quot;leap of faith&quot; for them as the &quot;leaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of faith&quot; taken by people of religious viewpoints since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time immemorial?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I remember going through similar thoughts in my past, and feeling like I
</em><br>
was
<br>
<em>&gt; abandoning the cultural framework I had acquired as a child, and traveling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into the void.  Coming out the other side, with no visible means of
</em><br>
support,
<br>
<em>&gt; I felt more liberated, more confident, and free of much excessive baggage.
