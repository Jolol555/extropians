<em>&gt;<a href="mailto:mez@apexnano.com?Subject=Re:%20[Iraq]%20The%20real%20reason%20for%20the%20war">mez@apexnano.com</a> writes: I find this suggestion amusing. As you may recall 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;from our previous
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conversations on this list, I'm from the middle east, I speak arabic, and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;spent a few weeks in the region this past December. Of course I read the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;middle eastern papers. I also keep up with the content published in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Arabic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;versions that doesn't show up in the English translations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;MEZ,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Then laugh all you want if you are amused but tell me why you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pushing the Arab party line instead of admitting the truth. Your people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hate us
</em><br>
<em>&gt;because of who and what we are. They don't like our women, they don't like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;men, our TV, our movies or our way of life. I have even read when they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;didn't like for men to wear our Levi's because they are too revealing
</em><br>
<p>&quot;our men&quot;?   &quot;our women&quot;?   &quot;our Levi's&quot;???
<br>
<p>&quot;Overpaid, oversexed, and over here.&quot;  Remember that one?  Remember who 
<br>
said it?  Are you losing any sleep over it?
<br>
<p>Even if the Arab world DID hate your people/media/clothing, so the hell 
<br>
what??  9/11 didn't happen because of an ill fitting crotch line.
<br>
<p>On that basis, why don't you send Pat Robertson and his ilk to Guantanamo 
<br>
then?  Or perhaps the Southern Baptist Convention for their &quot;women should 
<br>
submit to their husbands&quot; diatribe.
<br>
<p>And while you're doing that, bung Mary Whitehouse in there as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;and they feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;contaminated shaking the hand of one of our women in an American business
</em><br>
<em>&gt;setting.
</em><br>
<p>Rubbish.  Seems to me you've bought into someone elses' lie on this 
<br>
point.  Muslim men do not shake hands with ANY woman.   They do not shake 
<br>
hands with Western women.  They equally do not shake hands with Muslim 
<br>
women.  Nothing to do with contamination.  Simply culture.  When I say 
<br>
goodbye to my mother, I hug and kiss her on the cheek.  When I say goodbye 
<br>
to my Father, I hug him.  Does that mean I see him as 
<br>
contaminated?  No.  Simply a cultural distinction.  Some people do no more 
<br>
than shake hands with their Father.  Strange to me, not so strange to 
<br>
them.  I think I can learn to live with that.
<br>
<p>If you ever happen to win a Nobel prize, you will shake hands with the King 
<br>
who presents them.  If you meet him subsequently, you do not shake his 
<br>
hand.  In fact, he will refuse your gesture.  This is culture, and it's 
<br>
different the world over.
<br>
<p>It's nothing to do with who or what you are.  It's to do with their culture 
<br>
and how we percieve it.  Get over it.  Get beyond it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Instead you want to make it sound as if we have deeply offended you on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some deep level and that the evidence we have found is non existent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Heck after more than fifty years your people can't even tell the truth
</em><br>
<em>&gt;about Israel nor admit they have a right to live except at your mercy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not qualified to respond to this point, and to be honest, I don't think 
<br>
it needs to be dignified with one.
