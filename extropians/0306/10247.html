The best way I can explain the difficulty of beating the market is to point 
<br>
out that most any trade you can make in the market is essentially a 
<br>
zero-sum bet.  You could just buy or sell the market portfolio, or a very 
<br>
low risk asset, or any linear combination in between.  *Any* other trade is 
<br>
equivalent to such a trade plus a bet.  In the bet the two sides in essence 
<br>
each contribute some linear combination of the market portfolio and a 
<br>
riskless asset; the winner gets to keep both contributions and the loser 
<br>
gets nothing.
<br>
<p>Now obviously it is possible to win bets.  But it is also obvious that on 
<br>
average bets are not won; with transaction costs the winners are more than 
<br>
balanced by the losers.  Now it can be rational to make bets to hedge 
<br>
risks; that's what insurance is.  But rational agents do not make bets with 
<br>
each other for speculative reasons; making a bet is agreeing to disagree, 
<br>
and rational agents don't do that.
<br>
<p>Of course not everyone is rational; all that speculative trading going on 
<br>
is proof of that.  But when making a bet you should ask yourself why you 
<br>
think you are *more* rational than the folks you are betting with.  Yes, 
<br>
some people are probably more rational that others.  But clearly most 
<br>
people over-estimate their own rationality.  So do you feel lucky, 
<br>
punk?  I'm told that an old poker adage is that there is a fool at every 
<br>
table; if you look around the table and don't see him, he's you.
