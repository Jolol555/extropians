In a message dated 6/10/2003 2:25:45 PM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:rafal@smigrodzki.org?Subject=Re:%20Globalization%20was%20RE:%20Was%20Re:%20PHYSICS:%20force%20fields%20(RANT)">rafal@smigrodzki.org</a> writes: In the long term however, 50 or 500 years, you want to maximize 
<br>
growth, even at the cost of reducing immediate consumption (obvious to anyone 
<br>
who chooses between paying off a mortgage and buying a new car when the old 
<br>
one still runs). Since globalization of the economy increases the effective 
<br>
amount of resources available for enlarging our knowledge, allows uniform 
<br>
increase in production capacity, and a uniform increase in demand across the whole 
<br>
world, including long-term demand for American goods, globalization is the 
<br>
long-term favorite over narrow, parochial approaches, like mercantilism, and 
<br>
protectionism. This is why globalization is good for the American consumer, as well 
<br>
as the European, African or Asian consumer 
<br>
<p>Rafal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I won't say you are right or wrong.  There are too many contradictory 
<br>
facts flying around for me to evaluate at this date.
<br>
-- I was in manufacturing for almost 30 years and a consultant to 
<br>
manufacturing management for a little over 20 years after that.  My observation informs 
<br>
me that the expense of American goods is more due to the incompetence of 
<br>
American Manufacturing Managers than to the price of American Labor.
<br>
-- As we transition to automated equipment we actually go down the 
<br>
productivity curve compared to the old manual labor.  The logic is simple.  We lay off 
<br>
the more intelligent skilled labor that actually did a lot of the managing of 
<br>
our systems and replace them with less intelligent workers.  We are left with 
<br>
untrained managers making the decisions.
<br>
-- Within the last week a von Mises institute article stated that the average 
<br>
American family is spending about 10% of their savings, on balance, each 
<br>
year.  My memory could be faulty on that data.  They may have said 10% of their 
<br>
income.  I am not sure.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is but a small portion of what I am hearing.
<br>
