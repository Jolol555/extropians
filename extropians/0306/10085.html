<em>&gt;  &gt; Most of the hijackers were not Palestinians So what you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean to say is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;that coming to the aid of your allies (in  this case  fellow 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; muslims) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;is Wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What I'm saying is that thinking 911 helped Palestinians is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stupid and that thinking the main reason Muslims hate 
</em><br>
<p>It brought out the current policies to light, didn't it?
<br>
Sure, it took *two* years before anyone in the US media
<br>
had the balls to bring up these issues, but finally they're
<br>
discussing it...  And just to be accurate; Arab's don't hate
<br>
Americans so much as American policy and this 
<br>
administration.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Americans more than they love life is because of alleged 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistreatment of a people they've never seen is baloney.
</em><br>
<p>First off, its not alleged.  There's documented proof all
<br>
over the place of Israeli's human rights violations....
<br>
<p>And Second, you don't know Arabic people very well;
<br>
'cause if you did, you would know, that unlike American's,
<br>
Arabs are very emotional.  And so far as it relates to Islam,
<br>
Islam is a brotherhood, and ALL muslims are troubled when
<br>
one of them is attacked.  
<br>
<p>The direct equivalent of what you're saying btw, can be 
<br>
extended to NY;  why should any of the other states 
<br>
(whose populace has not met a NYer or been to NYC) 
<br>
care about 911 then?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     &gt; And before 911, the status quo was good?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, the Islamic leaders America supported were brainless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thugs, the Islamic leaders America opposed were  brainless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thugs too. Islam has had nothing but brainless thugs leading 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them for 800 years and some would like to blame America for that too..
</em><br>
<p>So then let them democratically elect their brainless thugs than :)
<br>
And I gaurantee you they will be religious based... 
<br>
<p>Stop interfering.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; And how did you manage to equate fundamentalism with wanting
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Americans dead?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By listening to their words, such as that great man of peace 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and religious tolerance Osama bin Laden:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Jihad is allowed against infidels like the Jews, Christians 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and atheists&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Actually, he's right; technically Jihad is open to everyone :)
<br>
It is however, a defensive action... so if you can't see the
<br>
blood staining your hands, I could see why you would confuse
<br>
it with religious crap.  Others do see that blood, however.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot; Our enemy, the target -- if God gives  Muslims the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity to do so- is every American male&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies--civilians 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and military--  is an individual duty for every Muslim who 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can do it in any country in  which it is possible to do it&quot;
</em><br>
<p>First, thats one fundamentalist party leader (of which there
<br>
are many); Second, that are moderate &quot;fundamentalist&quot; party
<br>
leaders that don't agree with him and declared his jihad to
<br>
be wrong... Ergo my point that equating fundamentalism and an
<br>
American body count is not a valid 1-to-1 mapping...
<br>
<p>Second, in his eyes, and his followers eyes, you're killing 
<br>
off their people.  Plain and simple.  If you don't have a problem
<br>
going to war for your people, why shouldn't they be able to follow
<br>
your logic?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And 911 proved he's not just talk too.
</em><br>
<p>Yuppers, I agree.  All the more reason to fix the policies
<br>
I mentioned earlier
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;     &gt; Sure, go ahead, pick a fight with a people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We didn't pick a fight with anyone, 
</em><br>
<p>You do when you support Israel, and call it your ally.
<br>
Remember your little quid-pro-quo, how could we not
<br>
come to the aid of our ally? Well, you've declared openly
<br>
that Israel and the US are allies... So *why* would you be
<br>
so flabberghasted when you get attacked?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; we didn't ram airliners 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into skyscrapers, they did, and now they would do well to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remember that Islam has not won a war with the west or even a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; battle in centuries.
</em><br>
<p>But ya did get your ass spanked in Vietnam :) No offense intended to 
<br>
vietnam vets (for whom I have a great deal of respect for persevering
<br>
in a VERY difficult situation).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;Pretty much all they want you to do is stop fucking with them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bullshit.
</em><br>
<p>At least this time, you can't feign (understable given the US 
<br>
mentality and level of education in unadulterated historical context)
<br>
complete ignorance of the situation.  Besides, EVERYBODY in the world
<br>
recognizes your (our, sadly) strategy now.  Be prepared for a more
<br>
stiff political environment.
<br>
<p>Or as an AI theorist said it best, in uncertain games, 
<br>
the best strategy to employ is Tit for Tat.
<br>
<p>omard-out
