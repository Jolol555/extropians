I'd prefer not nuclear.  Because then you'd need an army to protect the
<br>
vessel from terrorists turned plutonium pirates.  Also a sudden nuclear
<br>
accident at sea doesn't leave many options for evacuation.
<br>
And we'd be enough problems without GreenPeace trying to board us every
<br>
five minutes for being a potential nuclear threat to the dolphins.
<br>
<p>What about an oil converter to reprocess waste into oil and a couple
<br>
wind turbines to make up the 15% lost efficiency. Surely that'd be
<br>
enough to power the carrier.  Or fishing nets to provide fresh seafood
<br>
and make up for the 15% loss with additional oceanic biomass.

<p>Ah but the question is whether the cost of a nuclear reactor
<br>
is in the fuel or the shielding?  [I actually suspect that ship/sub
<br>
based nuclear reactors are probably much cheaper than the civilian power
<br>
plant equivalents due to the lack of a very large &quot;containment&quot;
<br>
facility.]
<br>
<p>Now if we need shielding one probably wants something with
<br>
a high hydrogen content.  Hmmmm....  Humans are mostly water. Water is
<br>
2/3 hydrogen.  Wouldn't a selection of luddites (Rifken, Bill Joy,
<br>
select members of the ETC group, a number of European officials opposed
<br>
to GMO, etc.) do the job? The only thing I'm worried about is that there
<br>
may not be enough true luddites to provide sufficient shielding.
<br>
<p>Damn.
