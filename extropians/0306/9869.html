<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting question, this. This sum only exists as 
<br>
an expression of the US Goverment's will. Asking what one 
<br>
would do with this sum without taking the USG into account 
<br>
strikes me as meaningless. So rather than ask &quot;Given the 
<br>
choice, what would you rank as the most extropic way to 
<br>
expend US$200 billion?&quot; let me propose a variant: &quot;Given 
<br>
the choice, what would you rank as the most extropic _and 
<br>
politically acceptable_ US$200 billion?&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>BOUNDLESS EXPANSION:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;USAF currently studies better access to space in the 
<br>
medium term (2010-2020). Whether or not government 
<br>
programs can make space travel cheap, this goal has 
<br>
military support. A breakthrough here opens up a good many 
<br>
options humanity currently lacks: off-world resources, 
<br>
space colonies, a back-up in case of local catastrophe, 
<br>
etc. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let's spend $40 billion on various projects, 
<br>
including (if no technical spoilers exist) building a 
<br>
space elevator (<a href="http://www.highliftsystems.com">http://www.highliftsystems.com</a>). Cheap 
<br>
access to space, no more expensive than trans-oceanic air 
<br>
travel, gives us B.E. in a literal sense.
<br>
<p>SELF-TRANSFORMATION:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would the government help individuals help 
<br>
encourage personal responsibility? It seems very unlikely 
<br>
that any constituency for this exists in the USG. Throwing 
<br>
more money at drug rehabilitation seems one way to help 
<br>
people transform themselves, and it has some precedent in 
<br>
the government's current activities. Spend $5 billion on 
<br>
this
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Education also counts as self-transformation. 
<br>
Radical new ideas in education could draw seed money. By 
<br>
&quot;radical&quot; I don't mean things such as charter schools or 
<br>
union-busting, but things such as the air-dropped 
<br>
computers in Steigler's &quot;Earthweb.&quot; Greg Burch might have 
<br>
a link for real-world proposals. Spend $15 billion on all 
<br>
of these.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For those who take a more radical view of 
<br>
self-transformation, perhaps a fat series of contracts to 
<br>
Kass and Fukuyama would help. Throwing money at them for 
<br>
heading a multi-year elite commission whose 
<br>
recommendations will never see use might indefinitely keep 
<br>
them out of public view. Say $1 billion here. :-)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life extension definitely falls under ST. I find it 
<br>
hard to imagine the government spending money here more 
<br>
effectively than the market. This probably reflects my 
<br>
ignorance more than the actual state of affairs. Spend $19 
<br>
billion here.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I skipped DO IT SO for want of time, but also left 
<br>
$120 billion unspent. Anyone care to continue?
<br>
