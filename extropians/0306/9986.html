<p>
I've not included it here, but Michael Dickey posted a quite emotional
<br>
response to my reply to him. Nothing wrong with emotions. However, I find it
<br>
extraordinarily difficult to respond to. I feel that my comments have not
<br>
been interpreted with the subtlety that many of them deserve, and am not
<br>
about to try to correct that, point by point. This communication is very
<br>
clearly a tar baby, who I refuse to beat further.
<br>
<p>Michael accuses me of, amongst other things, being a moral relativist. I
<br>
don't think that I am; I think that I have some strong moral principles
<br>
which feel absolute. However, I don't understand what they are grounded on -
<br>
I believe logically that they can have no absolute basis, which leaves me in
<br>
a bind. Fixing this is definitely on my to-do list, and will probably occupy
<br>
a large portion of my entire life.
<br>
<p>I wish to leave aside the previous discussion, because I think we'll get
<br>
nowhere. Hopefully we can agree to disagree (even though that means that at
<br>
least one of us is not a bayesian rationalist :-)
<br>
<p>I want to try to change the direction onto something a bit more directly
<br>
extropian. Directly to you, Michael, although still also to the rest of the
<br>
list: What would you do with $200 billion at your disposal? What would you
<br>
perceive the most extropian use of such resources to be? If they differ, why
<br>
is that? If they are the same, why is that?
<br>
<p>I'll answer this question myself (and much kudos to Robert B and others for
<br>
having a bash at it). I still need to think about it though. I think it's a
<br>
really interesting question, because it relates to the kind of world that
<br>
extropians would envisage. Another way of putting it would be: Say the
<br>
leaders of the world came to you and said &quot;We don't know what to do.
<br>
Extropians seem to have the right answers. How should we be running things:
<br>
what's the really big picture and how do we handle it?&quot; How do we respond?
<br>
<p>To me, the ultimate ethics revolve around people. More people, with more
<br>
ability to self actualize. Along these lines, I can't really abide by
<br>
population control measures, for example. Poverty, oppression, lack of
<br>
education, all of these top my goals for Bad Non-extropian Stuff. Hard to
<br>
solve.  I do believe that if people can have access to enough resources
<br>
(wealth) and education, many other problems go away (eg: overpopulation).
<br>
Free societies probably require minimum levels of both wealth and education.
<br>
It seems to me that there really are enough resources now in the world for
<br>
noone to have to be poor (relative to current standards), but that we have a
<br>
distribution problem. However, throwing money at the problems pretty
<br>
obviously doesn't solve them. Often, local tyrranies do seem to be major
<br>
blocks to helping people (one of the really major distibution problems). Is
<br>
there a non-violent way to deal with these? 
<br>
<p>I'll come up with something more concrete if possible.
<br>
Emlyn
<br>
<p>(Oh, and I don't mean to ignore Michael's oft ask question. No, no one has
<br>
the right to be a dictator (perhaps excepting if his/her citizens choose it,
<br>
but maybe not even then))
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Emyln commented:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Not true. No war, no war casualties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, so Saddam Hussein insisted on a war, and had *no* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his rule over the Iraqi people.  If Saddam had left, no war, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and no war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causalties.  Yet you still blame the war causalities on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the corrupt murderous dictator who felt it his right to rule over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will grant you that people may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; died by the actions of their government, somewhat counteracting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difference between war and peace (slightly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *may*?  Whats the figure now, 300,000 in mass graves?  May!?  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, im sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ol Saddam would have just stopped his mass killings, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; oppressive rule, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploitation.  What about the deaths from the sanctions, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which as a result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the war, have been lifted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Remember, though, that you must also count the rioting and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; general civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disturbance that has followed the war, and all the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; casualties incurred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there, as part of the toll of the war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, the moral culpability lies on Saddam, not the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coalition.  Saddam and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Baath party could have easily agreed to and facilitied a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; peaceful change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in government, and he *chose* not to.  *chose*.  No power 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outages, no water
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shortages, no phone problems, no cluster bombs, no rioting. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. etc. etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam is still to blame for each and every death, you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely MISS the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point that he has NO RIGHT to be a dictator, and thus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything that results
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from his insisting he remain a dictator he is morally culpable for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You have no right to take over your neighbors house by force, and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally culpable in everything that happens as a result.  In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the US system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of law, you are held morally accountable if anyone dies, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a member of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the group committing a crime, while in the act of committing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a crime.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the criminal taking over the neighbors house, if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friend helping you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dies in the process, you are held morally accountable.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to take over a neighborhood than your neighboors house, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no more right to take over a country than you have your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighboorhood.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no right to continue to rule over that country.  You are morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountable for every death that occurs from the freeing of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those you rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over.  How can you DARE imply that I would be as morraly culpable from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deaths that result in my attempt to free the neighborhood, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; country, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have taken by force, when you have no right to rule that country!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the US system of law, you are also held morally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountable for deaths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that result from 'depraved indifference', which I assert each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ever war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposer is guilty of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; It is difficult for me to even began to coalesce the reasons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; why such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; statement is repulsive to me as an extropian and an person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; who values human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; life.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Come on, that's a bit strong. The statement wasn't supposed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to support or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; oppose the war itself; I was attempting to point out that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; sides to the coin of who is responsible for deaths in Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, and both sides of that coin have the head of Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your statemt implies it does not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; really have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; strongly object to the idea that an aggressive, invading 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power bears no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; responsibility for the deaths; it *always* does. Sometimes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that cost is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; warranted, as it may well yet turn out to be in this case. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; unescapable that when you attack a sovereign country and kill its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; citizens,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you bear the responsibility for those deaths. Anyone is allowed self
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; defense.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dictators are not allowed that right when they are defending 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; empowerment and enslavement of people.  Your comments 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to illustrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your strange conept of ethics.  As Mike Lorrey pointed out, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you are blaiming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the hostage rescuers for the deaths of the hostages.  Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; held every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; citizen in Iraq hostage, and his mass graves and murderous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; track record
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prove as much.  Yet you blame the deaths that result from his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; removal from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power on the rescuers, not the hostage taker.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;scroll past red herrings&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; As far as &quot;as an extropian&quot; goes, I am quite unconvinced 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; evaluated this war action using the tools of an extropian. Is state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aggression dynamist? Does it enhance liberty? Is it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructive, does it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; advance our knowledge of ourselves or the universe? Is it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational (in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; worst realpolitik sense perhaps). War, as a tool, is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibly one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; least extropic choices that you can make. It is statist, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; interferes with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; liberty, it destroys with abandon.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bla bla, all irrelevant to Saddam's morally culpability.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are nothing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less than a moral relavitist, or have such fleeting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical principles that they sway and bend with the slightest breeze.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is state pacifism progressive?  Does it enhance liberty (no) Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructive (no) Does it advance our knowledge of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe (no) Is it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational? (no) Apathy, deprativity, pacifism, ARE the least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropic choices
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you can make.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Does saddam hussein have a right to be a dictator, yes or no?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please present your case that WWI resulted in fewer liberties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please present your case that WWII resulted in fewer world liberties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please present your case that the Cold war resulted in fewer liberties
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Please present your case that this war will result in fewer liberties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The fact is, no two democratic nations have ever been at war, and no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic nation has ever waged war on another.  This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; century has seen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fewer wars in the world than any century before it.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previous century
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw some ten times as many wars as this, and the one before 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a similiar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase.  The are fewer and fewer wars, and more and more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; free people in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world, despite the moral cowardice presented by persons such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is not to say that I think war is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; always unquestionably wrong. It is that war is the tool of last
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resort, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then to be questioned, and the aggressor must always carry the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stain of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inevitable blood on its collective hands.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And Saddam was merely the innocent victim in this event, with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the coalition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the evil aggressors.  You ignore, of course, the case for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pre-emptive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strikes as a form a self defense, insisting unabashadly that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the coalition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was an 'aggressor' did you forget the Gulf War?  Where Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invaded a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neighboring country that we agreed to protect in case of such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invasion?  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolutions that resulted in this war came about as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flagrant disregard by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IRAQ of those agreements to end that War.  On multiple 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounds Saddam's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regime was the aggressor.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Regardless of your opposition to the Iraq war, had the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; goal of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; coalition been simple to remove Saddam just because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; would have *still* had more moral validity than a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderous dictator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; remaining in power, simply because he was a murderous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; dictator.  Dictators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; have *no right* to be dictators!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It may very well have had more moral validity, but you are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparing two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative numbers of great magnitude.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it might very well!!!?? Did it or didnt it!? How *much* more?  only a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little?  Again, dispicable ethics.  The Coalition removing a murderous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictator from power 'might' have had more moral validity that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said murderous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictator remaining in power?  Natasha, these are the kinds of twisted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical systems I am talking about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let me pose a different question:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A little googling (not all that much, so I could be mistaken)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tells me that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Iraq war has/will cost the US government (ie: the US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people) between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US$100 and US$200 billion. That's a lot of money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You can look at a figure like that as an extropic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potential. The US has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spent US$200 billion in extropic potential in waging this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war. Forgetting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; questions of moral validity, etc etc, I would ask the list this:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Given the choice, what would you rank as the most extropic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way to expend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; US$200 billion?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I might post a response to this myself; I'll have to think on it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All interesting questions which I will contemplate, but completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrelevant to Saddams moral culpability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Every single person who died in the coalition war did so ONLY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; because Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; did not want to give up his control over the 20 million or so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Iraq.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; That's not correct. Choices were made on both sides, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; certainly each side
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; carries a moral burden (assuming some consistent set of rules). The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; agressors hands can never be clean.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, you paint the coalition as a patent aggressor, which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paints a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; picture of its own, that you disgregard pre-emptive strikes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self defense and disregard the pre-existing military 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggresion by IRAQ that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the UN resolutions were born from.   Care to elaborate on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your requirements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the moral justification of a pre-emptive strike?  Care to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case that this war was not an escalation of the Gulf War, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agreements
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which ended that having been broken by IRAQ?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Please explain to me your ethical principles that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; place his choice in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; this conflict of staying in power and opposing the coalition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; efforts in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; morally valid catagory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I simply can not fathom how any extropian can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; consider Saddam's actions in this situation as morally valid.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't defend Saddam Hussein. I defend neither side - big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; negative numbers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Disgusting in itself.  Is the US as bad as a world presence as Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussien?  I invite you to imagine a world controlled by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam, and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convince me that neither side is worth defending.  Rubbish, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you wouldnt even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a computer nor an internet to surf on if Saddam was the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world leading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power, you, in all likelyhood, would be either a poor peasant 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmer, dead,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or never have existed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

<em>&gt; &gt; There's no necessity to hand out black and white hats; the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; boolean (unless we are in a sim :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You did not answer the question.  You clearly indicate that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally equally, then perhaps one *might* be morally more valid than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; another, why?  why not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;  Given his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; past track record of murder, future likely hood of murder,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; track record of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; wars and aggressiveness, systematic effort to wipe out the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; kurds, slaughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; of some 50,000 shiites, suspicions of harboring WMD, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; resulting in the untolds thousands of deaths, etc. etc I can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not even began
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; to understand how you place the moral culpability of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; deaths on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; people attempting to STOP that, instead of the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; choosing and insisting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that he must continue it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, that's not actually true. The coalition of the willing went
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in to stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; development and use of WMDs. Laudable self interest, if it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is true (??).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, the saving of the iraqi people was *not* the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driver for this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; action.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So?  Again the primary motivation is irrelevant.  If the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqi people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freed from a murderous tyrant, I dont care if Bush's primary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivation was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tossing a few chicken bones and reading their divine meaning. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Freeing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqi people was certainly not ANYWHERE in the list of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddams motivations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for remaining a murderous DICTATOR!!!  Ah, but the coalitions efforts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *might* have been more valid.  Again, disgusting.  Simply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because 'freeing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the IRAQ people' even appeared on the coalition list of goals 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justifies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their moral highground over Saddam remaining in power!  Yet 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you insist the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalition bears more of the blame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I and other have argued previouslly on this list, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motivations are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant, it is actions that are relevant.  We can argue all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; day long what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the true motivations of the coalition were, oil, revenge, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WMD, free Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democractic Arab Nation, etc. etc.  We can judge from the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stated goals,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which did include freeing Iraq (Hence, 'Operation Iraqi 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Freedom', and not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'Operation Find WMD')  It is the ACTIONS we must judge on.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The Actions in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the case have led to the ousting of a murderous tyrant, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freeing of some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 20 million people, the ending of a monopoly over the worlds 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; largest energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reserves by a murderous tryant who used said energy reserves 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for murder and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tyranny, the setting up of a democratic arab nation to stem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the tide of Arab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fundamentalist Islamic hatred, and to curtail the creation 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and spread of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; WMD.  Lets compare the results of this action with Saddams 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remaining in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power, shall we?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *might* be more morally valid!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; To which you did not respond.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are on my killfile. Sorry. I only see your posts second hand
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in other's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; replies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then why do you ask me questions?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm pretty sure that I didn't say that. Got a direct quotation?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Emlyn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Perhaps it is only evidence that you want to sheild yourself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from critics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of you strange system of ethics.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just to clarify, I shall ask you the same question I asked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Damien, and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; can choose to not answer as he has of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Is Saddam Hussain morally culpable for the deaths of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; civilians in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Coalition lead effort to remove said murderous tyrant from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; power, or is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; coalition morally culpable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Both share some of the burden, of course. I believe that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; coalition must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wear the majority, as I've said above.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; THE COALITION MUST WEAR THE MAJORITY!!!!  Amazing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, Natasha, more evidence of the disturbing ethics present on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Extropy list.  Emyln is saying that Saddam Hussein, as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderous dictator,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a track record of hundreds of thousands of deaths, had 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more of a moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to remain in power then the coalition had to oust him.  I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely flabbergasted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about the right of the 20 million people under saddams 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murderous rule?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do they, at least, outweigh his right to continue to rule them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is balanced by an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; altered future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that is the result of their actions; how much so is impossible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; say. When
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; compared to the aftermath in Afganistan (ie: not stable 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democracy) it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; very difficult, I think, to say thus far how much the war 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is justified by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the result.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Given Saddams track record, unless the coalition led efforts kill more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people than would have died had Saddam remained in power, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; validity is clear.  Of course, life is not the only thing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we value,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; freedom and standard of living are valued also, have you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compared these in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your possible future tallies?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are right that I am against the Iraq war. It is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because, as I've said
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; above, from an extropian standpoint it stinks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regardless of whether you supported the war or not, Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; still had no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to be a dictator, and thus when the coalition was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knocking on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doorstep every death that resulted HE is morally culpable for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For the record, does anyone have the right to be a dictator?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  I wont outline it again
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (because I have above), but I really think that it should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be clear that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; must be a tool of last resort, if to be used at all. Not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only is it a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (spectacular) waste of resources and lives, it decreases 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our freedoms at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; home.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just like WWI and WWII did right?  They definately decreased 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our freedoms.
</em><br>
