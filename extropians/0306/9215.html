<em>&gt; I believe as extropians we are bound to draw closer together over the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; course
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the next few decades (or centuries) and we ought to seriously consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clever, economical, and downright cool strategies that might enhance our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understanding and appreciation of these final, historic, pre-singularity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; days.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ................
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>This prompts me to voice one thing I have noticed about the list in general 
<br>
(from my viewpoint anyway)  As a group I think we are adding to extropy. At the 
<br>
same time, we are all doing it through individual efforts. Other than 
<br>
regional meetings, etc., Extropianism seems to be a very solitary affair. Where each 
<br>
of us is still waging  our daily war with the everyday problems of life. We 
<br>
still have to work, pay bills and live in our own houses,  with no help from 
<br>
fellow extropes other than rare snippets of advise.
<br>
<p>Pooling our talents in a collective pot would seem a very obvious and 
<br>
hopefully profitable endeavour. Maybe we should forward a few ideas for an extropian 
<br>
business? we are all online and im sure many of us would be very happy to 
<br>
devote time and knowledge if we had a financial gain. We already have Writers, 
<br>
researchers and probably everything we need to start an online publishing 
<br>
company. 
<br>
Maybe a new everyday life list would help, where we could exchange ideas and 
<br>
advise on everyday things. Such as health, finances even just swap recipes.
<br>
<p>with a group of people this big, with such a broad range of skills, there 
<br>
must be dozens if not hundreds of things we could do collectively. That could 
<br>
make our lives just a little bit easier.
<br>
<p>Any Ideas? how about a proposal for an experiment, to see if we can achieve 
<br>
something like a small business?
<br>
<p>Alex
