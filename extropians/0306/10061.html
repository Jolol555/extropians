<em>&gt; Paul Grant commented:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; And the same could be said of Saddam.  However, Saddams 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral goals, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that of remaining a murderous dictators, are far more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repugnant that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Coalitions moral goals.  Do you agree?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hardly; both are seeking to maintain power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is a dictator seeking to maintain power as legitimate as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; democratic constitutional republic seeking to maintain power? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  (since you clearly assert they are both only attempting to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maintain power)...
</em><br>
<p>Thats correct, especially when you consider how said 
<br>
governments wield that power...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are asserting, basically, that no form of government is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any more legitimate than any other, and all are equally not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate. 
</em><br>
<p>There is of course, the classic theoretical example of a 
<br>
benevolent dictator, as well as an negatively-influenced 
<br>
representational democracy.  I believe that the pursuit of power
<br>
in and of itself is an evil act, but that evil contained in establishing
<br>
dominance over others can be redeemed if and only if that power
<br>
is wielded to increase the common good, as judged largely 
<br>
by the population that was recently put under its boot heel.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Do you acknowledge that some forms are government are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more legitimate than others?  
</em><br>
<p>Depends on what you, as a citizen, expect from your government,
<br>
and what you're willing to give in trade, and whether that trade takes
<br>
place.  So no :) I don't think you can declare one form of governance
<br>
more legitimate than any other.  Personally I prefer a true democracy,
<br>
in that given the choices of all other forms (representational democracy
<br>
as practiced in the U.S. and other countries included), I would rather
<br>
have
<br>
the right to directly influence policy, even though it may miniscule,
<br>
than rely
<br>
on another individual to represent my choice.  Of course that choice may
<br>
not be a
<br>
good choice, depending on who your neighbors are, and the spirit of the
<br>
times you
<br>
live in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; insist, as some libertarians do, that absolutely no state is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate unless it is perfect, 
</em><br>
<p>I would, ultimately, prefer a state that uses the minimum amount of
<br>
force necessary,
<br>
and successfully extends both the quality and length of both my life and
<br>
that of my 
<br>
neighbors [speaking as one race of people] while pursuing the
<br>
accumulation of knowledge
<br>
and the education of said neighbors.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; or under no circumstances is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any state legitmate, and thus all states are equally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illigetmate?  If that is the case, let me ask you this, would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you perfer to live under a democratic consitutional republic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or under Saddam Hussein?  Why?
</em><br>
<p>Could I be Saddam Hussein? 
<br>
See my point? It really depends on your status within that government,
<br>
and by what criteria you judge it to be an effective form of government
<br>
given your needs versus the costs involved.  For instance, I for one, do
<br>
NOT like security at the cost of civil liberties.  As an educated
<br>
person,
<br>
I feel I am perfectly capable of making decisions for myself, and so
<br>
also 
<br>
oppose the notion of forced government-run retirement plan. etc.  Thus 
<br>
every form of government has its benefits, hindrances and costs, and
<br>
thus
<br>
the value of any particular form of government lies in the value
<br>
judgements
<br>
of its citizenry.  However, having said that, said approval does not
<br>
impart any 
<br>
native (or supreme) legitimacy to any particular form of government.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; I was planning on releasing this to the press Monday 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morning, but....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;President Bush.  It pleases me to inform you that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should abdicate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Your thron...OFFICE prior to the end of the week.  If you do so you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will Ensure that there is &quot;no senseless waste of time, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; energy, money, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goodwill, and ~288 million Americans would have been freed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; drop of Blood being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shed. If you do not vacate your office immediately, I (and history)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; will hold you morally culpabable.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is a dictatorship under you a form of goverment that is as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitiamte as the existing democratic constituional republic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; currently present?  (no, it isnt, in case you are not sure)  
</em><br>
<p>&lt;grin&gt; thats your value judgement.  Personally I'm glad saddam hussein
<br>
is out of power.  I could pick out a dozen more arab leaders without
<br>
blinking an
<br>
eye; however, I thoroughly oppose the method by which it was done, the 
<br>
reasoning why it was done (ostensible and otherwise), and of course, 
<br>
the intended replacement for said regime, not to mention the 
<br>
inevitable consequences involved in running over centuries old legal 
<br>
concepts that were in fact, better than the (pursued) alternative
<br>
options.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The fact the you designate this as an example illustrates the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; little time you have spent considering the validity of states 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the implications of your ethical ideas.  The onus of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral culpability lies on the presider of the least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate state.  
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps in a zero sum game of blame.  But really, I think there's
<br>
more than enough blame for all of us to go around....
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A dictatorship is certainly the least 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; legitimate there is, least extropic, and most immoral.  I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprised this even made it to the list as a 'counter' 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument to my comments.
</em><br>
<p>Oh the horror :) We disagree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; putting down a long-standing rebellion when the rebels invited in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; foreign power because they were scared of the consequences.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wonder what consequences they might have been scared of?  
</em><br>
<p>Retribution of course.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Kuwait was internationally recognized and a member of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; United Nations before Saddam took power in Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>Not by Iraq my friend.  So what the UN ratified them; its common
<br>
knowledge that the UN has acted as a rubber stamp for the US in
<br>
its pursuit of its interests.  I would almost go so far to say that
<br>
until Powell's speech before the UN, and the subsequent sidestepping
<br>
of the UN in the rush to war, and the loss of the US  on the seat of
<br>
the human rights commission, the UN was not &quot;real&quot;; it was just a
<br>
thinly veiled attempt to cover the real action with pseudo-legitimacy.
<br>
<p>And just so you know, its not a particularly new or clever gambit
<br>
either.
<br>
There have been many cases were foreign powers rushed to recognize
<br>
weak nation-states of strategic interest to them, in order to cement
<br>
alliances
<br>
and force a &quot;moral&quot; war.  And of course, after the war, they then stay
<br>
for 
<br>
the &quot;protection of the state from its enemies&quot;.  Notice a pattern?
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;   This particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; With foreign powers and psuedo independent states etc has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been played 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out Repeatedly through history.  I can't technically fault 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the man for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; his &quot;invasion&quot;;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Kuwait would have expanded his capabilities.  'course he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got his butt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spanked by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The US, but that's another story.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, I am flabbergasted, please explain to me what right a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictator has to invade another country?  Oh, yeah, thats 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right, he just need not recognize that country as a seperate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one, and thus can do whatever he pleases!
</em><br>
<p>Hell, Bush invaded Iraq and that already had sovereign status.
<br>
And no, its particularly relevant when the land in question is a
<br>
breakaway from a nation-state.  I also note that I don't hear 
<br>
you complaining about chechnya (sp?), which is also in a similar 
<br>
situation..  I'm sure I could find others examples if thats not
<br>
good enough for you.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Your statements do not seem to coincide with the idea of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being an extropian.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps, like most people, I am a mixture of several philosophies,
<br>
and not just one.  And to my pragmatic way of thinking, no philosophy
<br>
should consume your ability to independantly and critically examine
<br>
a situation from several frameworks.  The results of said analysis
<br>
of this particular situation and how it affects and preserves or
<br>
increases
<br>
the  beneficial qualities of our current global situation being the
<br>
meat of this subject.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I am out of my mind?  I have still yet to hear you say 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that no one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; has the right to be a dictator.  As an extropian, can you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; acknowledge the basic moral premise that no one has the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; a dictator?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It *is* technically better than anarchy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &lt;grin&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You did not answer the question, does anyone have the right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be a dictator, yes or no.  Yet again, someone who evades 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the answer.
</em><br>
<p>The phrase &quot;It *is* technically better than anarchy&quot; is a
<br>
perfectly clear answer to your question.  In my opinion,
<br>
under my value system, yes, a dictator is better than pure 
<br>
anarchy (at least considering the available examples of 
<br>
pure anarchy to date).  Whether that is &quot;extropian&quot; or not,
<br>
I do not know.... Give me a little time to read up on the 
<br>
philosophy as it relates to political structures and I'll get
<br>
back to you on it.
<br>
<p>omard-out
