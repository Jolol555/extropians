<p>Umm, meaning no sacasm, but where I come from, &quot;why&quot; is a question, not a 
<br>
reason.
<br>
<p>I think you mean something like &quot;The reason is that there can be no 
<br>
excuse...&quot; etc.
<br>
<p>This seems to presuppose that you can accurately model the thought 
<br>
processes of the putative sim writer[s]/editor[s]/operator[s]. Your blanket 
<br>
claim, if I understand you correctly, that there can be no good reason, is 
<br>
a bold one. You haven't supported it in any way as far as I can see.
<br>
<p>Now, if you go to the Problem of Evil matter, which is probably one of the 
<br>
primary  reasons reflective people go agnostic (the other being the &quot;rock- 
<br>
he-can't-lift&quot; sort of notion, that a god wth all the listed attributes 
<br>
must be self-contradictory and thus impossible--though that more often 
<br>
leads to the faith of atheism--&quot;I know what God is supposed to be and he 
<br>
can't be, 'cause he can't be that!&quot;)...anyway, that doesn't seem to be your 
<br>
aim or viewpoint so far, but I'm raising it just in case:
<br>
<p>Lately, my favorite explanation for the Problem of Evil (shamelessly stolen 
<br>
from somebody) is the conjecture that /God is _malevolent_, but _only 80% 
<br>
effective_/.
<br>
<p>No, I'm not serious when I countenance this notion. I only do it to be more 
<br>
amusing to...whom it may concern. :)
