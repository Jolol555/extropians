<p><em>&gt; Beautiful vision.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A preliminary stage of that goal would be a kind of virtual riding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out before breakfast which has always been one of my favourite dreams....
</em><br>
<p>Nice vision yourself!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would not be interested in real omniscience though. I would rather call it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a kind of *omni part taking* without the intention to rule over situations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or people, an anarchical observer state in the Kantian sense of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;interesselosem Wohlgefallen&quot; (indifferent pleasure).
</em><br>
<p>Well, to &quot;know&quot; as in &quot;omniscience&quot;, is hardly to rule over situations!
<br>
This viewing---as you yourself so aptly described---is informative only---
<br>
(except over what's MINE, of course).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The abuse that arises in animal brains while being logged into trillions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cameras is obvious.  First we have to get rid of greed and lust for power.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And I believe, this state of mind is much harder to achieve than a first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; class consciousness transfer or an omnipresent camera system. The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moral obligation to appease reptile and monkey layers in our brains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems to be the more urgent task in my opinion.
</em><br>
<p>How do you propose &quot;we&quot; do it?
<br>
<p>As for me, I propose that it get done the same way that war and
<br>
violence themselves have diminished so strikingly in recent
<br>
centuries.  Gradually societies and individuals find it less
<br>
profitable to use force to obtain their goals.  Plot the per
<br>
capita involvement in war and crime over the past centuries
<br>
in the advanced nations, and the trend is clear.
<br>
<p>Another option that I have no problem with is allowing parents
<br>
to select their children's genes.  Even Mafiosi will go for the
<br>
&quot;tough but fair&quot; standard, and their children may opt for gentler
<br>
world yet genes.
<br>
<p>Sorry, but I get nervous whenever people I disagree with politically
<br>
start to mention what might be proposals for governments to remold
<br>
society, or for top down solutions in general.
<br>
<p>Lee
