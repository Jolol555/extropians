</em><br>
<p>Uh, it seems to me that the question at issue is when (if ever) the cost
<br>
of rationality is &quot;too high.&quot;  Robin Hanson has argued that not only does
<br>
this happen (often), it is, in fact, what happens most of the time for
<br>
most people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I confess I wasn't even counting the time-energy budget as a loss, just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking it for granted as something a person's gotta do eventually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, even taking into account the substantial cost in time and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mental energy, I still say it's the all-time best investment I ever made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and I still think it's worth a shot for others too.
</em><br>
<p>I suspect that Robin's characterization of the time-energy cost was only a
<br>
characterization of the costs which rise on account of piecemeal
<br>
acceptance of rationality.  (ie. it's harder to be rational when you can
<br>
do so bit-by-bit, because it's easier to believe that you've already made
<br>
plenty of progress.)
<br>
<p>But Robin has already described a variety of other costs of rationality
<br>
that have little to do with the cost/difficulty of overcoming your own
<br>
subconscious: for example, the inability to engage in certain kinds of
<br>
social situations, the opportunity-cost of missing out on group loyalty,
<br>
and so on.
