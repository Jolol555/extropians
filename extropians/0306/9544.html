I must agree with Adrian that the get big then get money plan doesn't appear
<br>
to work.
<br>
<p>If you look at what the scheduler idea (you could expand it a lot to include
<br>
all kinds of extra social networking features), it's primary goal is to be
<br>
the killer app for wireless devices. I mean, geez, a schedule on it's own
<br>
doesn't really get me all worked up; it's a bit dull. The point is that it
<br>
(in some variation perhaps) could move wireless mobile computing devices out
<br>
into the consumer market big time. And that's a very extropic goal I think.
<br>
<p>Following from this, there are lots of hardware and infrastructure people
<br>
who I think are really struggling to find the killer app for their devices.
<br>
So rather than get big first, I think you go find interested already big
<br>
parties, and partner with them.
<br>
<p>I'm not a business guy (as has been amply demonstrated to many already, I'd
<br>
warrant). But I'd say the plan of attack with something like this is to 
<br>
1 - put together a business plan, 
<br>
2 - try to hook up with someone who has or can make the contacts needed with
<br>
a/some phone/hardware/network companies
<br>
3 - build a prototype, targetting the right orgs' devices &amp; infrastructure.
<br>
The goal would likely be to make something really, really slick and easy to
<br>
use, going for &quot;user ecstacy&quot; rather than too many whiz-bang features.
<br>
<p>Something interesting with this idea is that it probably doesn't require
<br>
much, if anything, by way of patents. It's not about IP, it's a tool for
<br>
pushing a technology that many wealthy entities really want to push. It's
<br>
not a unique idea; it's actually pretty pedestrian. But I think it has legs
<br>
in context.
<br>
<p>So what happens next?

<em>&gt; &gt; Rough plan for action would be ( i think )

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1) Get established as one of the widely used

<em>&gt; &gt; internet based scheduling

<em>&gt; &gt; solutions. ( make it free, make it superior to yahoo

<em>&gt; &gt; calender and others -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this should not be that difficult )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 2) ramp it up by supporting everything internet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; enabled and wireless ( this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is technically quite easy if you have it in mind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; when creating the system)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3) when half  the western world are customers, sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out to someone who wants
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the eyeballs, or figure some way to earn a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; respectacle revenue from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; service.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Umm...that is the canonical dotcom business plan: get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large *then* get income, and assume that all or most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the users will stay once the income generation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mechanism is installed (usually, a dramatically false
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption).  True, many such businesses did get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funding, but most places that funded these types of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; businesses have learned their lesson and will not back
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this type of venture again.  Income has to come before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you get big.  (The earlier suggestion of starting out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big, by starting out as an additional feature of one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a few established cell phone networks, suffices to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get around this since the payment method has also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already been established.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course, if You pull it off, the reward when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; selling the company or being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; taken over would most probably be in the triple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; digit million euro range.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ( look at similar companies and their worth )
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While there have been some success stories, most of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the existing companies with plans comparable to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above aren't doing so well, and more - more than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average for small businesses - no longer exist (and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thus have a net worth of zero).
