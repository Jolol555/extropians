<em>&gt; Why is it a crime in the USA to profit from information one has in one's own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brain that others don't have in theirs? Isn't knowledge and insight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something we should reward? Where in the US Constitution is it stated that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the federal government is granted the power to tell US citizens what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can and cannot do with the business information contained in their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains? Who owns our brains, anyway?
</em><br>
<p>Why insider trading is illegal for the company:
<br>
The theory is that the stockholders own the company.  Any material information that would affect purchasing or selling decisions
<br>
must be disclosed to the owners affected.  Any failure to do so jeopardizes the owner's assets and demonstrates a lack of due
<br>
diligence.  This is why inside information is illegal.  Nobody should be selling on secret information that has not been disclosed
<br>
to the public, because that would indicate that full and accurate disclosures are not being made.
<br>
<p>Why insider trading is illegal for the broker:
<br>
Stock brokers are supposed to be working for the benefit of their clients.  It is a conflict of interest for them to selectively
<br>
censor the information they pass to clients to manipulate their actions against their own interests in favor of the brokerage.  To
<br>
disclose different information or advice to different clients is clear evidence of misrepresentation.  When a stock broker advises a
<br>
big client to take the money and run, while deliberately letting their other clients keep their money invested, this is a conflict
<br>
of interest.  They are choosing in advance who will gain and who will lose.  They are consciously diverting funds from many smaller
<br>
accounts into the pocket of the big account.  And this is done by giving different representations to different clients.  This is a
<br>
conflict of interest, material misrepresentation, and deliberate fraud.
<br>
<p>Why insider trading is illegal for the trader:
<br>
There is nothing in the law that prevents people from using their own brains to predict stocks and make lots of money.  The legal
<br>
problem only comes in from receiving information secretly that should have been delivered to somebody else.  It is the intellectual
<br>
equivalent of being a fence and receiving stolen goods.  Instead of delivering the required information to the rightful owners (the
<br>
stockholders, all of them), this valuable information is secretly diverted to the insider traders.  Like fences, they profit from
<br>
receiving the information only if all of the rightful owners (stockholders) are deprived of the information.  They cannot profit
<br>
from inside information if it is equally shared with the rest of the stockholders.  Thus, like an illegal fence receiving stolen
<br>
goods, the insider traders is receiving stolen information that is owned by someone else without the owner's knowledge in a
<br>
deliberate attempt to steal value from the owner.  That is why even the trader is guilty under the law.
<br>
<p>My disclaimer:
<br>
I am not a lawyer, but I do have a business degree which included accounting and business law.  I am explaining my understanding as
<br>
to &quot;why&quot; insider trading is illegal.  This speaks only to the motives of the lawmakers for passing these laws.  This is not a
<br>
discussion of &quot;what&quot; is illegal or what &quot;should&quot; be illegal.
