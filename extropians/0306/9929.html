<em>&gt; &gt; Not true. No war, no war casualties.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right, so Saddam Hussein insisted on a war, and had *no* right to continue
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his rule over the Iraqi people.  If Saddam had left, no war, and no war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causalties.  Yet you still blame the war causalities on the coalition, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not the corrupt murderous dictator who felt it his right to rule over
</em><br>
<em>&gt; millions of people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>We, America, insisted on a war.  Many countries tried to tell us it was not 
<br>
needed.  Many of our own people tried to do so.  But we were railroaded on 
<br>
the basis of WMD which we really had no good evidence for and which never 
<br>
materialized.   
<br>
<p>If Bush and company had backed down then there would not have been this 
<br>
senseless waste of time, energy, goodwill and money for nothing.  Nor are we 
<br>
likely to extricate ourselves gracefully from the resulting mess for some 
<br>
time and at ever more expense in dollars, time, goodwill and lives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will grant you that people may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; died by the actions of their government, somewhat counteracting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difference between war and peace (slightly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *may*?  Whats the figure now, 300,000 in mass graves?  May!?  Yeah, im sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ol Saddam would have just stopped his mass killings, oppressive rule, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exploitation.  What about the deaths from the sanctions, which as a result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the war, have been lifted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You know as well as I that that WAS NOT THE REASON we went so trying to 
<br>
whitewash this senselessness afterward with such is highly dishonest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Again, the moral culpability lies on Saddam, not the Coalition.  Saddam and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Baath party could have easily agreed to and facilitied a peaceful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change in government, and he *chose* not to.  *chose*.  No power outages,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no water shortages, no phone problems, no cluster bombs, no rioting. etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. etc. Saddam is still to blame for each and every death, you completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; MISS the point that he has NO RIGHT to be a dictator, and thus anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that results from his insisting he remain a dictator he is morally culpable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No, you cannot put the entire culpability on Saddam.  We were the invaders. We 
<br>
are the occupiers.  We did not need to be.  Some of the power outages and 
<br>
water shortages and so on were not even necessary according to our own 
<br>
statements of what was and was not a legitimate target and our much vaunted 
<br>
ability to hit more or less only what we wish to hit.   If you are going to 
<br>
continue to be dishones then I will ignore you on this subject from this time 
<br>
forward.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; You have no right to take over your neighbors house by force, and are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally culpable in everything that happens as a result.  In the US system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of law, you are held morally accountable if anyone dies, even a member of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the group committing a crime, while in the act of committing a crime.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the criminal taking over the neighbors house, if you friend helping you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dies in the process, you are held morally accountable.  You have no more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to take over a neighborhood than your neighboors house, and you have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no more right to take over a country than you have your neighboorhood.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no right to continue to rule over that country.  You are morally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accountable for every death that occurs from the freeing of those you rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over.  How can you DARE imply that I would be as morraly culpable from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deaths that result in my attempt to free the neighborhood, or country, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have taken by force, when you have no right to rule that country!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the US system of law, you are also held morally accountable for deaths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that result from 'depraved indifference', which I assert each and ever war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposer is guilty of.
</em><br>
<p>OK.  You are out of your mind on this one.  I hope you get over it.
