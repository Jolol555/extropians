</em><br>

<p>Personally I consider &quot;the enemy&quot; all that is unextropic and works toward 
<br>
greater human chaos and suffering.  But designating &quot;the enemy&quot; is itself 
<br>
sometimes questionable as far as extropic value is concerned.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Well, of course by &quot;the enemy&quot; you mean Saddam Hussein.  I'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sorry that I haven't followed the list so closely recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have a good feeling for how excessive the accusations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The attacks are baseless slander.  They are based on these people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not jumping on the bandwagon to support the war and the president.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Any liberal, democratic or peaceful position is being lumped in as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being anti-American.  This is incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But doesn't it all depend on how you conceive of what your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proper duties are as a citizen?  Is it not also highly parameterized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by circumstances?  I'm sure that you can think of many historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations (or simulations) in which sufficient danger would exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or in which sufficient fealty would be the norm, that it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true that &quot;if you are not with us, then you are against us&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.  It is baseless slander to accuse people of supporting persons and groups 
<br>
there is no evidence, except trumped up questionable reading into statements 
<br>
or absence of same, that there is any such support.  That is so regardless of 
<br>
what one beliieves are one's &quot;duties as a citizen&quot;.    It is obvious that the 
<br>
situations at hand are certainly not a place where &quot;if you are not with us 
<br>
you are against us&quot;.  Frankly I could care less whether there are any 
<br>
(doubtful) circumstances where such binary thinking might be correct.  That 
<br>
is not the question.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I readily understand that you cannot take insults lying down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and that you need to defend what &quot;anti-American&quot; would mean to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you (not that you and others have neglected this).  I myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt the utility or the wisdom of such provocations---yet if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could (and I don't know---perhaps you've tried) get those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to explain more concretely what they mean when they use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such terms, perhaps the disagreements would be loftier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Why is the burden of effort on those who are the victims of the slander?  The 
<br>
slander itself is against the principles of this list.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; These are our friends being accused of war crimes.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; excessive.  What is going on here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is going on is differing conceptions of what a country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or a nation should be, and the proper amount of allegiance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is due.  ;-) Your cries of &quot;slander&quot; are just as much an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; overreaction as theirs of &quot;war-criminal&quot;, or &quot;traitor&quot;, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps they did start it.  Sorry to keep beating on my theme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; here, but it's the underlying assumptions that need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argued about, not the surface phenomena.
</em><br>
<p><p>No, I do not believe that is what is going on.  Actualy real slander is being 
<br>
done and the quotes are misplaced.  Point out that it is slander to call any 
<br>
of us a &quot;war criminal&quot; and so on is not in the least on the same level as 
<br>
using those terms against those who oppose some of this country's recent 
<br>
actions.  In this country it is also not a matter of debate whether simply 
<br>
disagreeing with the actions of the government and saying so makes one 
<br>
anti_US or unpatriotic much less a &quot;traitor&quot;.   The freedom to do so is one 
<br>
of the defining principles of this country.    The &quot;other side&quot; has continued 
<br>
to ignore this and simply repeats their baseless attacks and accusations over 
<br>
and over again.   I have had enough of it.
