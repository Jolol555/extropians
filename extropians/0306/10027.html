<em>&gt; --- Samantha Atkins commented, regarding Michael
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dickey:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You are out of your mind on this one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Six words tells the whole sad story.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The next time you are tempted to respond to Michael
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dickey, (or Ron h, or Max Plumm), concerning matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political (Have they ever offered another kind?) ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself this,  &quot;If, while walking down the street, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dog behind a fence starts barking at you, do you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down on all fours, nose up to the fence, and proceed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to engage said dog in a barking contest?  Supposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, do you regard this as a rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exchange?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Best, Jeff Davis
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>Coming from the man who said &quot;the good guys won&quot; about vietnam.  4 million
<br>
deaths and 30 million enslaved people later, you still think 'the good guys
<br>
won'
<br>
<p>I note on the extropian principles 3.0 that it states:
<br>
<p>&quot;Supporting social orders that foster freedom of speech, freedom of action,
<br>
and experimentation. Opposing authoritarian social control and favoring the
<br>
rule of law and decentralization of power.&quot;
<br>
<p>Since the opposite of what this particular entry in the extropian principles
<br>
is an accurate description of the current communist government in vietnam, I
<br>
wonder how you can both consider yourself an extropian and have considered
<br>
the 'good guys' to have won in that conflict.  Perhaps you do not consider
<br>
yourself an extropian? Or, another option, perhaps you do feel that the
<br>
vietnam communist government fosters free speech and opposes authoritarian
<br>
social control?
<br>
<p>If you can not defend your political viewpoints to criticisms, either dont
<br>
make them, or dont attack those who feel they deserve criticism.  Opposing
<br>
points of view deserve an audience.
<br>
<p>Additionally, I have made contributions non-political to the extropy list,
<br>
but even if I had not, so what?  Politics only discussers are not forbidden,
<br>
and there is no quota of non-politcal discussions required, nor any criteria
<br>
required to meet.  Do you suggest that matters of politics not important to
<br>
extropian interests?  I would argue that they are far more important than
<br>
90% of what is discussed on this list (e.g. what would you ask god if you
<br>
saw him) And when people of this list endorse ethical principles that are
<br>
certainly NOT extropian, or consider governments that could not be any more
<br>
anti-extropian as 'good guys' I feel it vitally important to make my
<br>
political points.
<br>
<p>Interesting to note that those who tend to disagree with you are the ones
<br>
you draw the analogy to a dog barking loudly on all fours.  Coincidence?
<br>
<p>Further, Jeff, I wonder if you consider anyone to have the *right* to be a
<br>
dictator.  I suspect you, just like everyone else, will refuse to answer.
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
