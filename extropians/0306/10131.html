<p>I would be surprised if something like this hasn't
<br>
already been patented.  It would be easy to do, since
<br>
the fragrances are already available on the market.
<br>
Since the fast stream of hot exhaust is already zipping
<br>
past in the manifold, creating a low pressure reservoir,
<br>
all one would need is a valve in a line that goes into
<br>
the exhaust pipe.  Open the valve and the liquid goes
<br>
in, is atomized by the hot exhuast gas and there you
<br>
have it.
<br>
<p>A variation on this theme was introduced by Kawasaki
<br>
on their motorcycles in 1980.  The air pollution rules
<br>
at that time were on the verge of requiring motorcycles
<br>
to add expensive and heavy catalytic converters to
<br>
reduce the concentration of nitrous oxides in the 
<br>
exhaust.  Kawasaki drilled holes in the exhaust pipes
<br>
and inserted what amounted to a venturi in the pipe,
<br>
so that outside air would be sucked into the pipe.  This
<br>
of course did not change the *amount* of nitrous oxides
<br>
produced, but by mixing outside air with the exhaust,
<br>
it reduced the *concentration* of the pollutants coming
<br>
out of the exhaust pipes, allowing Kawasaki to pass the
<br>
tests.  
<br>
<p>Then of course the EPA recognized the absurdity of the
<br>
rules as written and changed them, obviating the need
<br>
for Kawasaki to drill holes in the exhaust pipes.  But
<br>
the same idea could still be used to suck perfume into
<br>
the pipes if you wanted.  {8-]  spike
