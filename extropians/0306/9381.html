</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, you mean option (2)?
</em><br>
<p>Actually, option (2) seems unlikely.  I prefer a variation of option (2).
<br>
Any civilization advanced enough to simulate the entire universe certainly
<br>
can do it in a way that keeps us from finding out.  It seems to me that if
<br>
they really wanted to simulate a real universe, and they really wanted to
<br>
simulate their ancestors and keep the simulation at a primitive level, this
<br>
would require that the simulated people not discover that they are in a
<br>
simulation.  As such, simulations that allow us to question it are probably
<br>
very rare.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that all you're saying here is that we don't have enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence to pick between 2 and 3.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.  There is not evidence for or against a simulation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example, you ask: &quot;what if simulations are just as boring as reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and nobody makes them?&quot; and I answer: well, what are the odds of that?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's f[I]?  .5?  .25?  .1?  I think you'd have to be pretty confident to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that the answer is even one in a hundred, say nothing of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one-in-a-million or one-in-a-billion, and I don't think we have that kind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of confidence.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, Bostrom postulates that these simulations are specifically
<br>
ancestor-based, and specifically realistic.  This seems to define them as
<br>
exactly like reality in less exciting times.  To me this almost requires the
<br>
simulation to be boring.  It must be of things we already know and of things
<br>
we have already seen.  Boring!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Here, I think, you have missed the point of this argument.  Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transhumanists still seem to believe that *we* will create simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environments, in which it will be impossible for our simulated subjects to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; falsify the claim that they are in a simulation.  This is a solid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prediction that makes claims about what kinds of worlds there will be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; namely, that there will be some simulated worlds that we'll make.
</em><br>
<p>Name me one transhumanist who wants to build a world as mundane as this one
<br>
with our levels of tragedy and suffering.  Nobody I know would build a world
<br>
just like reality is today.  I think we all would want to build better
<br>
worlds that are more exciting and have less suffering.  As an example, our
<br>
own goals would lead one away from this type of simulation instead of toward
<br>
it.

<em>&gt; Again, no one is postulating that we live in a simulation.  That is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a conclusion, which should not be confused with a premise.
</em><br>
<p>I think this will be news to most people reading this list.  Many of them
<br>
think that Bostrom has lead them to the conclusion that we are &quot;more likely
<br>
than not&quot; to be inside a simulation.  If people want to reduce their
<br>
position to say that there is a small but unproven chance that we might be
<br>
in a simulation, I would have no objection.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There may be a lot of dreams, but they don't last very long, and they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not really that convincing, I don't think.  They only seem so because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our minds are dulled.  The total measure of observer-moments in reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is probably quite a bit greater than in dreams.
</em><br>
<p>This is my objection to the simulation premise.  I believe that all
<br>
simulations will be smaller, shorter-lived, and less defined than their
<br>
parent realities.  In fact, I see no reason to see simulations as any
<br>
different than dreams.  The fact that they are run on silicon-based hardware
<br>
instead of carbon-based wetware doesn't seem important.  Why not consider
<br>
the simulation computer to be a single entity, with the simulation itself
<br>
being its dream?
