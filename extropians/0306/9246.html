<p>DUBLIN, Ireland -- Projected onto a large screen, a plump blue butterfly 
<br>
darts and veers. For the delighted young girl in a wheelchair who controls the 
<br>
virtual butterfly's dips and twirls, the animated avatar offers a sense of 
<br>
acrobatic freedom. 
<br>
<p>Her moves with the butterfly are the first tentative dance steps by a group 
<br>
of children with disabilities. Guided by modified joysticks and microphones 
<br>
that will respond to gentle puffs of breath rather than voice commands, their 
<br>
butterflies will be part of a networked dance performance at a major European 
<br>
conference on disabilities and assistive technologies, to be held in Dublin later 
<br>
this year. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A mixture of able-bodied dancers and the avatars controlled by children in 
<br>
wheelchairs, the dance is the heart of a project called Feileacan (the Irish 
<br>
Gaelic word for &quot;butterfly&quot;) that combines complex human-machine interfaces and 
<br>
virtual-reality computer graphics tools. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Our mantra is that we want to expand human potential through innovation, and 
<br>
we really believe that every person deserves to benefit from technology,&quot; 
<br>
said Gary  
<br>
McDarby researcher with Media Lab Europe, a Dublin-based spinoff of the 
<br>
Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Media Lab.
<br>
<p>Media Lab Europe is partnering with New York University, London media and 
<br>
idea incubator SmarLab Centre New York's Montefiore Medical Center and Dublin's 
<br>
Central Remdial Clinic in a series of unusual projects. The group of 
<br>
leading-edge technologists and health-care professionals hopes to find more dynamic and 
<br>
creative ways for people with disabilities to learn and communicate. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Feileacan gives people with disabilities the possibility to interact and 
<br>
perform. It's technology that enables people to do things they couldn't do 
<br>
otherwise,&quot; said McDarby. 
<br>
<p>According to Kate Brehm, researcher with NYU's Center for Advanced 
<br>
Technology, this &quot;virtual puppetry&quot; lets children use the same techniques they would use 
<br>
to maneuver their wheelchairs. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The great thing is that you can personalize the interface for each child,&quot; 
<br>
said Joy Barrett, projects manager at Smartlab Centre. &quot;Depending on the 
<br>
abilities of the child, you could set up joysticks, a breathing device or even 
<br>
motion-tracking devices.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Another hugely popular virtual interactive world, called Still Life, uses 
<br>
mind-calming virtual-reality energy orbs to help improve coordination and 
<br>
concentration. A child can sit or stand before a computer screen holding a 
<br>
sensor-filled &quot;orb&quot; (or large ball) in each hand, one orange, one yellow. On the screen 
<br>
are two swirling energy fields, one orange and one yellow. The computer senses 
<br>
the location of the balls in the child's hands, and tracks their movement 
<br>
across the screen. 
<br>
<p>The child tries to remain still while slowly moving the ball in each arm, 
<br>
until the real ball tracks to its matching swirling energy force on screen. When 
<br>
that happens, there's a fireworks-like explosion of color, and slowly, a large 
<br>
puzzle piece appears on the screen. 
<br>
<p>Gradually, a jigsaw of a beautiful, otherworldly landscape begins to fill the 
<br>
screen. As long as the child holds still and only moves the balls, the 
<br>
landscape is visible. Any sudden move, and it fades away. Two people can play as 
<br>
well, each holding one of the balls and matching their movements. 
<br>
<p>The game encourages coordination and was inspired by the gentle moves of tai 
<br>
chi, with its ancient techniques for expanding concentration while learning 
<br>
how to remain calm and in control. 
<br>
<p>&quot;There's a lot of sophisticated technology behind what looks like a very 
<br>
simple interface. This is really looking at computer vision in a new way,&quot; said 
<br>
McDarby. The game requires a complex tracking mechanism, the ability to monitor 
<br>
feedback from multiple sensors, and intelligence to filter out background 
<br>
colors that could be read incorrectly as the two orbs. 
<br>
<p>Several other projects are in the works. Researchers are in the process of 
<br>
establishing a webcam network between several different Irish facilities for 
<br>
people with disabilities. So far, a basic network enables children in two Dublin 
<br>
locations to talk to and see others in Limerick and in Ennis, County Clare. 
<br>
<p>Two girls in wheelchairs, Katie and Amy, demonstrated the system at the 
<br>
Central Remedial Clinic by holding a cheerful conversation with other kids with 
<br>
disabilities in Clondalkin, a Dublin suburb, and in Clare. After a day of 
<br>
practicing with Feileacan and Still Life, the favorite query among the youths was, 
<br>
&quot;Are you tired?!&quot; accompanied by lots of laughter. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This is quite an innovative and flexible set of learning projects,&quot; said Ger 
<br>
Craddock, manager of technical services at Dublin's Central Remedial Clinic. 
<br>
The clinic children have workshops to use the technologies twice a week, he 
<br>
said, and with the webcam, are meeting children they otherwise would rarely, if 
<br>
ever, see. 
<br>
<p>&quot;This is a real means for the kids to further their own goals around learning 
<br>
and eventually, employment,&quot; he said
