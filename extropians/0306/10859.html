<p>I vaguely recall a Greg Bear SF book, &quot;Eternity&quot; (the sequel to the more
<br>
famous Eon), where among other things ...
<br>
<p><p>(SPOILERS)
<br>
<p><p><p>...humanity is more or less in perpetual war with an alien race called the
<br>
Jarts.  A captured Jart is uploaded into a computer, and then forgotten
<br>
about. The main character, for some reason I don't recall, proceeds to
<br>
load the Jart in the spare memory of his brain implants, believing that he
<br>
can control the alien, but he only starts a battle of will with an
<br>
uncertain outcome.
<br>
<p>Mentioned in the book is a fictional theorem, stating (if I recall
<br>
correctly) that a mind does not have a way to know if it is uploaded or
<br>
not, or where, if the necessary measures are taken. It seems that the Jart
<br>
does not know about the theorem, because it discovers right away what's
<br>
happening...
