I think, if I am copied/restored with tech/procedures that preserve a
<br>
sufficient part of the information physically encoded in my brain, then the
<br>
person who wakes up after this process will think that he is me. I am ready
<br>
to accept that if he thinks so, then it is so. So in principle I am ready to
<br>
accept uploading as a means of preservation of the identity.
