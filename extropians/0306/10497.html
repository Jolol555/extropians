<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;A third of the American public believes U.S. forces found weapons of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mass destruction in Iraq, according to a recent poll, and 22 percent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; said Iraq actually used chemical or biological weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not surprising, according to a recent Gallup Poll 33% think space aliens are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visiting Earth in UFO's and 71% think the government knows more about it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it says; and 45% think &quot;God created human beings pretty much in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present form at one time within the last 10,000 years&quot; There's almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing so stupid you can't get at least 20% of the people to believe it.
</em><br>
<p>Which of course, doesn't prevent such folks from being cited in opinion 
<br>
polls. I wonder if this is where the 'majority' pro-war opinion arrives 
<br>
from. They support bombing and killing of thousands but don't care 
<br>
enough to pay attention to the news after the bombing is over.
<br>
<p>For more on cognitive dissonance, there's a recent Counterpunch article:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt; I spent, I confess, several weeks waiting for the thunderous uproar 
<br>
that would inevitably follow the equally inevitable discovery that Iraq 
<br>
had no biological agents, no foul chemicals, no missiles capable of 
<br>
circling the papier-mache globe and blowing up Daytona Beach, Florida 
<br>
(or similar). The discovery has been made. You want mustard gas in Iraq, 
<br>
you'd better start eating pastrami. Yet the American public doesn't 
<br>
care. There will be no consequences to the Bush Administration for the 
<br>
naked, baseless savagery it perpetrated upon Iraq's people. Why not? The 
<br>
answer hit me like a full-scale papier-mache model of the Earth: 
<br>
Americans aren't upset about the Big Lie because they never believed it 
<br>
in the first place. They just didn't want to know.
<br>
<p>Wow, that's such a cynical idea it makes your skin all crinkly. Can it 
<br>
be that the average American so very much doesn't give a shit what its 
<br>
government does? Can it possibly have gotten this bad? We were until 
<br>
recently known as a generous and friendly people, if loud. Are we in 
<br>
fact the heartless maggots that such a concept would require? It boggles 
<br>
the mind. Where is the public outcry? Why isn't everybody in America 
<br>
going apeshit as the Bush  Administration slips into the same &quot;what, me 
<br>
worry?&quot; mode they employed after the failure to snare Osama bin Laden?
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>The beauty part of cognitive dissonance is the worse it gets, the more 
<br>
people throw up [their hands] and say &quot;who cares?&quot; In this way such 
<br>
public works projects as genocide and empire- building can be 
<br>
accomplished, because people refuse to care. It's too damn demanding, 
<br>
too scary, and too damaging to that ever-threatened bird called Self 
<br>
Esteem. But this is the time to take a good long look at your mindset, 
<br>
before things get so awful you find yourself goose- stepping down the 
<br>
Reichsparteitag rather than face the facts. Are you in a state of 
<br>
cognitive dissonance? Does the evidence of your senses not jibe with 
<br>
what you've been told is The Way Things Are? Do you find yourself 
<br>
redefining what is important to exclude what you don't want to believe? 
<br>
Are you angry at people who demand you think about issues you consider 
<br>
closed? Do you often find yourself wondering why everybody but real 
<br>
Americans are wrong? Do you believe there is one set of rules for 
<br>
America and a different set of rules for the rest of the world, and that 
<br>
America should enforce both of them? Are you a red-faced witless baboon?&gt;&gt;
