<p><p>Hmmm. On the carrier I was on there was no hotbunking with a complement of 5K 
<br>
men (Kitty hawk, built in the 60s).  But it is possible there was hotbunking 
<br>
in an earlier carrier.  Yes, the compartments often had as many as 100 people 
<br>
in them, and the beds were stacked 3 deep.
<br>
<p>As far as the viability of such a scheme...with extropian type people? YIKES! 
<br>
THat would be a disaster.  We are not all that sociable. I myself had a 
<br>
helluva time being confined that way with so many people. THe ones who 
<br>
actually like it are very sociable people.
