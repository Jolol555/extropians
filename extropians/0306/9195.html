<p>Weapons of Mass Destruction:
<br>
Who Said What When
<br>
CounterPunch Wire
<br>
<p><p>Simply stated, there is no doubt that Saddam Hussein
<br>
now has weapons of mass destruction. 
<br>
<p>Dick Cheney August 26, 2002
<br>
<p><p>Right now, Iraq is expanding and improving facilities
<br>
that were used for the production of biological
<br>
weapons. 
<br>
<p>George W. Bush September 12, 2002
<br>
<p><p>If he declares he has none, then we will know that
<br>
Saddam Hussein is once again misleading the world. 
<br>
<p>Ari Fleischer December 2, 2002
<br>
<p><p>We know for a fact that there are weapons there. 
<br>
<p>Ari Fleischer January 9, 2003
<br>
<p><p>Our intelligence officials estimate that Saddam
<br>
Hussein had the materials to produce as much as 500
<br>
tons of sarin, mustard and VX nerve agent. 
<br>
<p>George W. Bush January 28, 2003
<br>
<p><p>We know that Saddam Hussein is determined to keep his
<br>
weapons of mass destruction, is determined to make
<br>
more. 
<br>
<p>Colin Powell February 5, 2003
<br>
<p><p>We have sources that tell us that Saddam Hussein
<br>
recently authorized Iraqi field commanders to use
<br>
chemical weapons -- the very weapons the dictator
<br>
tells us he does not have. 
<br>
<p>George Bush February 8, 2003
<br>
<p><p>So has the strategic decision been made to disarm Iraq
<br>
of its weapons of mass destruction by the leadership
<br>
in Baghdad? I think our judgment has to be clearly
<br>
not. 
<br>
<p>Colin Powell March 8, 2003
<br>
<p><p>Intelligence gathered by this and other governments
<br>
leaves no doubt that the Iraq regime continues to
<br>
possess and conceal some of the most lethal weapons
<br>
ever devised. 
<br>
<p>George Bush March 17, 2003
<br>
<p><p>Well, there is no question that we have evidence and
<br>
information that Iraq has weapons of mass destruction,
<br>
biological and chemical particularly . . . all this
<br>
will be made clear in the course of the operation, for
<br>
whatever duration it takes. 
<br>
<p>Ari Fleisher March 21, 2003
<br>
<p><p>There is no doubt that the regime of Saddam Hussein
<br>
possesses weapons of mass destruction. As this
<br>
operation continues, those weapons will be identified,
<br>
found, along with the people who have produced them
<br>
and who guard them.
<br>
<p>Gen. Tommy Franks March 22, 2003
<br>
<p><p>I have no doubt we're going to find big stores of
<br>
weapons of mass destruction. 
<br>
<p>Kenneth Adelman, Defense Policy Board , March 23, 2003
<br>
<p><p>One of our top objectives is to find and destroy the
<br>
WMD. There are a number of sites. 
<br>
<p>Pentagon Spokeswoman Victoria Clark March 22, 2003
<br>
<p><p>We know where they are. They are in the area around
<br>
Tikrit and Baghdad. 
<br>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld March 30, 2003
<br>
<p><p>Obviously the administration intends to publicize all
<br>
the weapons of mass destruction U.S. forces find --
<br>
and there will be plenty. 
<br>
<p>Neocon scholar Robert Kagan April 9, 2003
<br>
<p><p>I think you have always heard, and you continue to
<br>
hear from officials, a measure of high confidence
<br>
that, indeed, the weapons of mass destruction will be
<br>
found. 
<br>
<p>Ari Fleischer April 10, 2003
<br>
<p><p>We are learning more as we interrogate or have
<br>
discussions with Iraqi scientists and people within
<br>
the Iraqi structure, that perhaps he destroyed some,
<br>
perhaps he dispersed some. And so we will find them. 
<br>
<p>George Bush April 24, 2003
<br>
<p><p>There are people who in large measure have information
<br>
that we need . . . so that we can track down the
<br>
weapons of mass destruction in that country. 
<br>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld April 25, 2003
<br>
<p><p>We'll find them. It'll be a matter of time to do so. 
<br>
<p>George Bush May 3, 2003
<br>
<p><p>I am confident that we will find evidence that makes
<br>
it clear he had weapons of mass destruction. 
<br>
<p>Colin Powell May 4, 2003
<br>
<p><p>I never believed that we'd just tumble over weapons of
<br>
mass destruction in that country. 
<br>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld May 4, 2003
<br>
<p><p>I'm not surprised if we begin to uncover the weapons
<br>
program of Saddam Hussein -- because he had a weapons
<br>
program. 
<br>
<p>George W. Bush May 6, 2003
<br>
<p><p>U.S. officials never expected that &quot;we were going to
<br>
open garages and find&quot; weapons of mass destruction. 
<br>
<p>Condoleeza Rice May 12, 2003
<br>
<p><p>I just don't know whether it was all destroyed years
<br>
ago -- I mean, there's no question that there were
<br>
chemical weapons years ago -- whether they were
<br>
destroyed right before the war, (or) whether they're
<br>
still hidden. 
<br>
<p>Maj. Gen. David Petraeus, 
<br>
Commander 101st Airborne May 13, 2003
<br>
<p><p>Before the war, there's no doubt in my mind that
<br>
Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,
<br>
biological and chemical. I expected them to be found.
<br>
I still expect them to be found. 
<br>
<p>Gen. Michael Hagee, 
<br>
Commandant of the Marine Corps May 21, 2003
<br>
<p><p>Given time, given the number of prisoners now that
<br>
we're interrogating, I'm confident that we're going to
<br>
find weapons of mass destruction. 
<br>
<p>Gen. Richard Myers, 
<br>
Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff May 26, 2003
<br>
<p><p>They may have had time to destroy them, and I don't
<br>
know the answer. 
<br>
<p>Donald Rumsfeld May 27, 2003
<br>
<p><p>For bureaucratic reasons, we settled on one issue,
<br>
weapons of mass destruction (as justification for
<br>
invading Iraq) because it was the one reason everyone
<br>
could agree on. 
<br>
<p>Paul Wolfowitz May 28, 2003 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------------------
<br>
<p>The warm and fuzzy ethical truism -- &quot;the end doesn't
<br>
justify the means&quot; -- is a cobweb.  Swept aside by the
<br>
bedrock of realpolitik: violence. 
<br>
<p>Practically speaking, the deed is done, the &quot;end&quot; of
<br>
Saddam is an accomplished fact.  By itself an
<br>
unalloyed plus and a clear victory for George Bush. 
<br>
So far so good.  Regarding deceit as tool to enable
<br>
the war: fugeddaboddit(sp?).  Victory will reformulate
<br>
the &quot;ethical&quot; equation.  At some primitive place in
<br>
the human psyche victory defines ethics.  Winning is
<br>
everything.
<br>
<p>Fascinating.
<br>
<p>But the fat lady is nowhere in sight.  And bet on it,
<br>
there will be surprises.  Fun stuff, and not
<br>
necessarily bad (depending on how you define &quot;bad&quot; of
<br>
course), neither. 
<br>
<p>One possible source of surprises: 
<br>
<p>The neocons have their agenda.  If they can get the
<br>
American troops out of the way, which is to say get a
<br>
puppet regime in place, complete with an effective and
<br>
disciplined security force, then they can temporarily
<br>
have their way.  But if US troops stay to implement
<br>
the &quot;nation building&quot;/reconstruction, then genuine
<br>
American values will be--inadvertently--taught at the
<br>
grass roots, and the neocon plan will be substantially
<br>
subverted.  It cannot survive genuine democracy and
<br>
town hall American optimism/decency, which, when the
<br>
war-fighting skill set is put away, is the resource
<br>
the troops-turned-nation-builders will draw on to win
<br>
the peace.
<br>
<p>Am I dreamin', or what?    
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;During times of universal deceit, telling the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;truth becomes a revolutionary act.&quot;
