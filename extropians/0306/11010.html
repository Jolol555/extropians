This one is just too funny:
<br>
<p><p>Three Labrador retrievers - a brown, yellow and black - are
<br>
sitting in the waiting room at the vet's office when they strike
<br>
up a conversation. The black lab turns to the brown lab and says,
<br>
&quot;So why are you here?&quot; The brown lab replies, &quot;I'm a pisser, I
<br>
piss on everything - the sofa, the drapes, the cat, the kids. But
<br>
the final straw was last night, when I pissed in the middle of my
<br>
owner's bed.&quot; The black lab says, &quot;So what is the vet going to
<br>
do?&quot; &quot;Gonna give me Prozac,&quot; came the reply from the brown lab.
<br>
&quot;All the vets are prescribing it. It works for everything,&quot; He
<br>
then turns to the yellow lab and asks, &quot;Why are you here?&quot; The
<br>
yellow lab says, &quot;I'm a digger, I dig under fences, dig up
<br>
flowers and trees, I dig just for the hell of it. When I'm
<br>
inside, I dig up the carpets. But I went over the line last night
<br>
when I dug a great big hole in my owner's couch.&quot; &quot;So what are
<br>
they going to do to you?&quot; the black lab inquired. &quot;Looks like
<br>
Prozac for me too,&quot; the dejected yellow lab said. The yellow lab
<br>
then turns to the black lab and asks what he's at the vet's
<br>
office for. &quot;I'm a humper,&quot; the black lab says, &quot;I'll hump
<br>
anything. I'll hump the cat, a pillow, the table, fire hydrants,
<br>
whatever. I want too hump everything I see. Yesterday, my owner
<br>
had just got out of the shower and was bending down to dry her
<br>
toes and I couldn't help myself, I hopped on her back and started
<br>
humping away. The yellow and brown labs exchange a sad glance and
<br>
say, &quot;So, Prozac for you too, huh?&quot; The black lab says, &quot;No, I'm
<br>
here to get my nails clipped.&quot;
