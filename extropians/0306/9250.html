<em>&gt; With regard to the ideas of doing something on land -- one

</em><br>
<em>&gt; as to what happens to &quot;cults&quot; that try to go against &quot;local&quot; laws.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So one wants something that one can park in international

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the U.S. Navy from taking you out with a few cruise missles 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- but it would be the first instance of an unprovoked attack
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  on an &quot;independent&quot; state -- something the U.S. would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think very seriously about from a diplomatic perspective.  
</em><br>
<p>Hmm I suspect (but don't know) that getting recognized as an
<br>
independent state might not be so trivial. But if you *could* 
<br>
perhaps one obvious business to be in is a (legal) tax haven. A
<br>
veritable floating post office of international head offices. 
<br>
<p>Tax avoidance (lawful tax mimization) as opposed to tax 
<br>
evasion (unlawful - usually involves lying or misreporting) in
<br>
most counties is, as I understand it, an art practiced proudly
<br>
and openly by the wealth as it is quite legal.   
<br>
<p>But for some reason some part of me is suspicious that such
<br>
a venture seems very vulnerable to old fashioned attack by
<br>
pirates etc. Or competitive corporate pirates at any rate.  
<br>
<p>Its true that Switzerland as the worlds bank rarely gets
<br>
attacked. But it takes a while to establish the clientele. 
<br>
<p>The Rainbow Warrior I, on the other hand managed to irritate
<br>
a certain European government and frogmen with explosives 
<br>
are probably not to hard to arrange if one wants to eliminate a
<br>
competitor that does not have a defence force. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You mean you killed a thousand people because they were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doing stem cell research that you object to based on some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strange belief system that is 2000 years old that 3/5 of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world population does not believe in??? 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Hell no it wasn't &quot;us&quot; it was an &quot;act of God&quot; and as such 
<br>
unfortunately, we suspect that when you check your insurance
<br>
policy you'll find your not covered.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Kind of creates problems with any claims for a fair or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable government.
</em><br>
<p>Sadly, not really &quot;claims&quot; are cheap. And those making the 
<br>
claims are likely to have pretty good media and spin control 
<br>
compared to the little community in question which lends itself
<br>
to considerable deniability. When a boat with commercial
<br>
interests and no national flag alligning it to some military there
<br>
are likely to be *lots* of plausible potential alternative suspects. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you think fair &amp; reasonable are unimportant, see my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recent post regarding the implications of the competition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between China and India to attain supremacy in space.
</em><br>
<p>I did miss that one. Would it impact the above?
