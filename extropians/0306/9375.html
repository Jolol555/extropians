[The &quot;VR-BAR&quot; is a simulated environment where extropians get together to
<br>
interact in a more realistic manner than text messages.]
<br>
<p>Harv:  (loudly) We're just wasting our lives pretending to be on the cutting
<br>
edge when we're not!
<br>
<p>(At this point the loud music in the bar has just reached dramatic pause and
<br>
Harv's outburst echoes in the temporary lull as everybody turns to stare at
<br>
Harv.)
<br>
<p>Harv:  Err...  (waves hands in a desperately explanatory manner) ...or NOT!
<br>
<p>(Music continues on.  Everybody continues their individual conversations.
<br>
Harv drops back down into his chair.)
<br>
<p>Blond:  (sitting at table left of Harv)  WOW, Eeyore!
<br>
<p>Denubian Slime-Mold:  (oozes off-table and away with nauseating gloppiness)
<br>
You're embarrassing me!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (sitting at table across from Harv)  I knew you would snap one
<br>
day!
<br>
<p>Robotender:  (Robot bartender arrives) Here's your SmartDrink.
<br>
<p>Harv:  (irritated) I didn't order any SmartDrink.
<br>
<p>Robotender:  It's from an anonymous patron.  You have 14 of these queued up.
<br>
(his red LED eyes stare matter-of-factly, then he swivels around and leaves)
<br>
<p>Harv:  (Slumps)  Oh!  (Punches numbers on his wristwatch to give the
<br>
robotender the sum total of 14 tips.)
<br>
<p>Robotender:  (voice comes back through the wristwatch)  Thanks, buddy!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (explaining to Blond) They make most of their tips from depressed
<br>
people.
<br>
<p>Blond:  (to Harv) At least you got free drinks.  I wish I had thought of
<br>
that!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (reading words floating on the side of the glass)  It's got
<br>
'Extra Smartening Power!'
<br>
<p>Harv:  (frowning at Brunette grinning back at him)
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (repeating for emphasis) 'Extra!'
<br>
<p>Blond:  So what's really bothering you, Eeyore?  No heffalumps?
<br>
<p>Brunette:  What's a heffalump?
<br>
<p>Harv:  It's an imaginary elephant seen only in children's stories or by
<br>
drunks.
<br>
<p>Brunette:  And you're seeing these, why?
<br>
<p>Blond:  Well, he just turned 40....
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (nodding in conclusion) You're drunk!
<br>
<p>Harv:  I'm bored....
<br>
<p>Blond and Brunette:  (both mocking extreme attentiveness to Harv's
<br>
explanation)
<br>
<p>Harv:  I thought this place would be better.  More impressive.  (Puts hands
<br>
up to frame imaginary headlines in the air)  &quot;Real Scientists...&quot;  &quot;Real
<br>
Solutions...&quot;  &quot;Real interesting...&quot;
<br>
<p>Blond:  But you've got 14 &quot;solutions&quot; queued up!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  And you've got friends all around you to help you drink them.
<br>
<p>Harv:  I wanted something real.
<br>
<p>Brunette:  We're not real?
<br>
<p>Blond:  (to Brunette) We're Heffalumps.
<br>
<p>Harv:  (sarcastically)  You're idiots!  (pauses to drink)  We're all idiots.
<br>
Why aren't we curing disease, building spaceships or uploading by now?  We
<br>
all just sit around and talk about great stuff we'll probably never get
<br>
around to doing.
<br>
<p>Brunette:  I want my flying car!
<br>
<p>Blond:  (nodding sympathetically) It's because of the Heffalumps, isn't it?
<br>
<p>Harv:  (points at Blond in excited agreement)  Yes!  That's it!  We're all
<br>
so busy building Heffalump traps.  (exaggerating paranoid expression) And
<br>
I'm beginning to wonder if there really are any Heffalumps at all....
<br>
<p>Blond:  (wide eyed)  You ARE Eeyore!  (takes a drink)
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (raising glass in toast) The New Eeyore!
<br>
<p>Blond:  &quot;Neo-&quot; Eeyore...  (nods expectantly)  &quot;Neo&quot;  Get it...?
<br>
<p>Brunette:  Well, tell us this &quot;Neo-Eeyorism.&quot;  It sounds dreadfully gothic.
<br>
<p>Harv:  I just wonder if we are wasting our lives.  Why aren't we doing
<br>
&quot;important&quot; things?
<br>
<p>Blond:  We?  Why aren't YOU?
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (simultaneously with above)  Like What?
<br>
<p>Harv:  I don't know.
<br>
<p>Blond:  (sadly dismissive)  The failure of the human brain...
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (putting on the voice of Q from Star Trek: The Next Generation)
<br>
But, I should have known that you would destroy humanity by your apathy.
<br>
I'm not the one doing nothing.  You're doing nothing.  You're doing it now!
<br>
You did it before, and you'll do it again.
<br>
<p>Harv:  (Picard voice)  Stop it, Q!  I'm not on trial here!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (as &quot;Q&quot;)  Aren't you?  You just don't get it, do you?  The trial
<br>
never ends....
<br>
<p>Blond:  (Draining glass and looks into it still holding it sideways)  All
<br>
good things must come to an end.  (puts down glass and turns toward Harv)
<br>
Really!  If you're bored, maybe YOU'RE boring!  If nobody's doing anything,
<br>
maybe you're their leader!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  Maybe they're all out there doing exciting secret stuff, and you
<br>
just don't know about it.
<br>
<p>All three:  (scanning the crowd for signs of intelligent activity...)
<br>
<p>All three:  (together, shake their heads)  Nah...
<br>
<p>Harv:  OK.  So I'm just expressing my boredom and my innate desire for
<br>
&quot;more&quot;!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  More?
<br>
<p>Blond:  (to Brunette) &quot;Moore.&quot;  (to Harv) You're a hacker!  A power-user.  A
<br>
&quot;security professional.&quot;  (He puts quote marks in the air with his fingers
<br>
and exaggerates the importance of the title.)  You always want things
<br>
faster, bigger, better than before.
<br>
<p>Brunette:  You mean, &quot;faster, SMALLER, better!&quot;
<br>
<p>Blond:  (to Brunette) Excellent!  (to Harv)  You're looking ahead into this
<br>
giant light-cone of the future that hasn't happened yet.  And you say (in
<br>
squeaky Harv voice), &quot;Oh look how much there is to do, and we haven't done
<br>
anything yet.&quot;
<br>
<p>Harv:  I don't sound like that!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  Whereas the other idiots don't see the future.  So they look
<br>
backwards at the small fraction of time in our history and say (gruff
<br>
non-Harv voice), &quot;Oh look how much we accomplished.&quot;
<br>
<p>Harv:  NOBODY sounds like THAT!
<br>
<p>Blond:  Everybody who sees the future is frustrated with the present.  It's
<br>
our burden for being visionaries.  We can never accomplish enough compared
<br>
to what we want to accomplish.
<br>
<p>Brunette:  Yeah.  You're exaggerating when you say we aren't doing anything.
<br>
What you really mean is (squeaky Harv voice) &quot;We aren't doing as much as we
<br>
want to do!&quot;
<br>
<p>Blond:  Everybody would agree with that.
<br>
<p>Harv:  I don't agree with that. (softer to self) Because I don't sound like
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>Blond and Brunette:  (faking distraction by looking elsewhere so they don't
<br>
have to respond to Harv's last statement)
<br>
<p>Harv:  (pretends to dramatically slam fist on table)  Maybe you're right!
<br>
(long pause while the other two stare at Harv expectantly)  Maybe I do sound
<br>
like that!  (other two laugh)  I mean, maybe I sound whiney!
<br>
<p>Brunette (sideways to Blond):  &quot;Wine-y&quot;?
<br>
<p>Blond:  (back to Brunette)  &quot;Winnie&quot;!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh?&quot;
<br>
<p>Blond:  &quot;Winnie-the-Pooh-Pooher-of-ideas&quot;
<br>
<p>Harv:  Stop it!  (finishes last of drink and sets down empty glass
<br>
simultaneously as Robotender is setting down another full glass in unison)
<br>
<p>Robotender:  (takes empty glass and puts it on tray he is carrying on one
<br>
hand)  Thank you for tipping in advance!  Your queue of 13 drinks can be
<br>
redeemed at any time.
<br>
<p>Harv:  (waves at his two companions)  Serve them, too.
<br>
<p>Robotender:  (serves two more drinks from his tray)  I knew you would say
<br>
that!  You are generous to robots and humans alike!  (swivels and leaves)
<br>
<p>Blond and Brunette:  Thanks!  (clinking glasses together and drinking)
<br>
<p>Harv:  (sarcastically rolling eyes)  &quot;Thanks...&quot;  Am I that predictable?
<br>
<p>Blond:  (nodding in agreement)  Predictable!  To robots and humans alike!
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (cheerfully)  And boring!  That's why we like you.
<br>
<p>Blond:  (setting down glass after large gulp)  And delicious!  Maybe you
<br>
should become less boring.
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (sideways to Blond)  Now you're scaring me.
<br>
<p>Blond:  Maybe you need to admit that you're just bored and depressed because
<br>
you just turned 40, you don't know what to do with your life, and you want
<br>
all of us to achieve our wildest futuristic fantasies!
<br>
<p>Harv:  OK, I admit it.  It's me, me, me!  I've got to do something if I'm
<br>
frustrated with things.  I'll try to do better.
<br>
<p>Brunette:  (sideways to Blond)  I notice he doesn't yell his retraction as
<br>
loud as his original outburst....
<br>
<p>Harv:  (rolling eyes)  OK!  (yelling with maniacal dramatic movements of his
<br>
hands)  We're not wasting our lives!  We really are on the cutting edge!
<br>
<p>(At this point the loud music in the bar has just reached dramatic pause and
<br>
Harv's outburst echoes in the temporary lull as everybody turns to stare at
<br>
Harv.  Then the music continues on.  Everybody continues their individual
<br>
conversations.  Harv drops back down into his chair.)
<br>
<p>Robotender:  Here's your de-caff Relax-o-Drink.  (setting down cup)
<br>
<p>Harv:  (irritated) I didn't order any....  (slumps in resignation)  Oh!
<br>
<p>Robotender:  You have 26 of these queued up.
