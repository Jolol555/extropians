<em>&gt; &gt; How does it take off? I'm pretty fuzzy on this;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Interoperability with the other popular scheduling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might help a lot - but beware what happened when the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IM
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world tried that.  (Companies changing the specs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; withoutbnotice, specifically to reject competitors'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compatible products.  A good reverse-engineering team,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monitoring the latest releases of and patches for,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which you want to be compatible with would help.)  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you could pull this off, though, that could easily get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your foot in the door - or, at least, convince
</em><br>
<em>&gt; competitors to adopt the same features.  (Extropic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; met, even if the business would probably only earn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; minor profits at best.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I forgot to mention that. A good start would be to have an import/export
<br>
function with a users' desktop copy of Outlook. That way a corporate user
<br>
can log onto the HotSchedule site, sync with his corporate outlook (via a
<br>
downloadable activex probably; it'd just talk com to the local copy of
<br>
outlook, and so sysadmins need be none the wiser).
<br>
<p>Maybe there's a way to keep a corporate outlook schedule and a web site in
<br>
sync, if you had the blessing of the system owners (such that they'd be
<br>
prepared to install custom software to do the integration)? I'd assume
<br>
that'd be a very small minority of users until you'd already won the main
<br>
game.
<br>
<p>About compatibility; in the case of Outlook, the product is open enough
<br>
(iirc) via com automation interfaces, to talk to it at a very high level.
<br>
It's not the same as the reverse engineering IM protocol game; there is no
<br>
attempt by MS to close it's desktop products.
<br>
<p>And there's not even much need to compete against MS. It'd probably be no
<br>
problem to sell the thing to them once it was doing well. The extropic goal
<br>
would already be met by then (ubiquitous personal roaming network access);
<br>
once it is met, we are done. Selling it would more than meet any goals of
<br>
profit :-)
