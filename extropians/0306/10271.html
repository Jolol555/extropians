<br>
<p><p><p>&lt;&lt;The nation's leading environmental groups can barely control their 
<br>
enthusiasm. ''We're bullish on wind,'' says Kert Davies, research director of 
<br>
Greenpeace USA. ''Everybody has to ante up in the fight.'' But like residents of 
<br>
dozens of communities where other wind-farm projects have been proposed, many Cape 
<br>
Codders have put aside their larger environmental sensitivities and are 
<br>
demanding that their home be exempt from such projects. As Cronkite puts it, ''Our 
<br>
national treasures should be off limits to industrialization.'' 
<br>
Wind is the world's fastest-growing energy resource, and after a decade of 
<br>
federal and state subsidies kick-starting the industry, creating enough power 
<br>
for more than a million American families in 27 states to tap into the breeze 
<br>
when they flick on their light switches. The country's oldest turbines have been 
<br>
part of the landscape on the Altamont Pass, east of San Francisco, for two 
<br>
decades. And Texans zooming along I-10 west to El Paso top a slight rise to the 
<br>
sight of a vast field of turbines stretching across the mesa. But energy 
<br>
providers in the Northeast, with its lack of wide open spaces, have long been 
<br>
consigned to dependence on oil, coal and natural gas, with only the occasional 
<br>
small-scale wind project. Then Jim Gordon got restless. The president of Cape 
<br>
Wind, Gordon is a quixotic sort of energy executive. At the age of 22, he put 
<br>
aside his dream of becoming Francis Ford Coppola and instead started a small 
<br>
company that designed and installed heat-recovery systems for hospitals and 
<br>
factories. Ten years later, after a change in regulatory law opened a niche for 
<br>
independent power producers, he pioneered the building of natural-gas-generated 
<br>
electric plants in New England, a region long captive to highly polluting coal 
<br>
and oil. Gordon eventually developed seven power plants throughout New England 
<br>
and became a very wealthy man. But with too much ''creative juice,'' as he puts 
<br>
it, to rest on what he had already done, he went looking for the next 
<br>
challenge. Wind became his fixation. ''Imagine tapping into this inexhaustible supply 
<br>
of energy right here in our own state, lowering the cost of electricity, 
<br>
decreasing pollution, reducing reliance on foreign fuel,'' Gordon said recently as 
<br>
he paced his company's boardroom in downtown Boston. ''We're feeding oil 
<br>
cartels whose whims move our economy and our armies. With wind, we can free 
<br>
ourselves from that.'' In 1999, Gordon sold off his power plants. With a Department 
<br>
of Energy wind map in hand, he and his team began searching for a place to 
<br>
build dozens of technologically advanced turbines that would plug directly into 
<br>
the region's energy grid. If he had been building in the West, Gordon would 
<br>
have looked to the plains, what those in the wind industry call ''the Saudi 
<br>
Arabia of wind.'' It being New England, he naturally looked to the mountains. But 
<br>
while the ridges of northern Maine offered plenty of gusts, he says, the 
<br>
transmission lines out of such underpopulated areas were already clogged. His eyes 
<br>
then fell on the sea. ..&gt;&gt;
