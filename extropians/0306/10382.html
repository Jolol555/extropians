<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

<p>Not true. Consider Robin's example of a salesman who honestly believes
<br>
that he's selling a better product.  Even if the salesman isn't
<br>
reproducing, his belief in his product is being rewarded with greater
<br>
monetary rewards.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that self-deception, particularly overly optimistic
<br>
self-assessment, is useful in any entity where efficiency of the
<br>
mental design is an issue, and any entity which is not in 100%
<br>
conscious control of its behavior.
<br>
<p>Why? Because an entity that can deceive itself can deceive others by
<br>
leverage its abilities at communicating things it truly believes.  An
<br>
entity that cannot deceive itself must invest in additional abilities
<br>
to become effective at deceiving others.
<br>
<p>Naturally, humans can do both.  But it does seem that humans who can
<br>
persuade themselves are most effective at persuading others.  It also
<br>
seems, anecdotally, that optimistic humans are more effective at
<br>
motivating themselves, more resilient in the face of overwhelming
<br>
odds, and in general more productive.
<br>
<p>An irony here is that you, Eliezer, strike me as a rather irrationally
<br>
optimistic person[*].
<br>
<p>mez
<br>
<p>* Lest this be interpreted as an ad hominem, let me state here that I
<br>
find a certain degree of irrational optimism a rather endearing trait,
<br>
and an extropic one.
