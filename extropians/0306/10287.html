<p>
I agree with Harvey below, but feel a little sorry for E_Shaun.
<br>
<p>I wonder if it would be worth having a once weekly meta posting
<br>
that explicitly brings the list rules to the attention of everybody.
<br>
Sure its repetitious but it could be more efficient overall.
<br>
<p>Subject line might read something like this.
<br>
<p>META:  List protocols and bulletin messages. Last updated xx/xx/xx
<br>
<p>Newbies get to see the META and its easy to refer them and each
<br>
other to gently if it appears weekly. (I suspect the list rules may be a
<br>
tad too hard to find -not quite in our face enough). Seeing the Subject
<br>
line Meta message above may be  reminder enough for those of
<br>
us who have read its contents.
<br>
<p>But here is another aspect. If Natasha (as ExI President) or E_Shaun
<br>
or someone on the board *wants* to issue a bulletin statement either
<br>
relating to list *health* or otherwise, this meta line, being accompanied
<br>
by a late update date, flags to the regulars that it has new content and
<br>
they should actually read it again as the content has changed.
<br>
<p>As a supplementary idea.
<br>
<p>If we want to get real creative we might include some short hand
<br>
symbols defined in the bulleting next to a legend.
<br>
<p>Eg
<br>
<p>&lt;AH-P&gt; Meaning an ad hominem has been *perceived* by the
<br>
reader and no further response will be made than to insert &lt;AH-P&gt;
<br>
under the offending line. This gives the person who may have
<br>
not really *meant* to be offensive the chance to reconsider and
<br>
restate. Ie. They get less ambiguous feedback then being ignored.
<br>
(Who can tell if a message has even been read) its hard to snub
<br>
or shun effectively on a list. Newbies, then might wonder what
<br>
&lt;AH-P&gt; means and investigate, but they won't conclude that
<br>
no acknowledgement means acceptance of the charge.
<br>
<p>&lt;SM-P&gt;  Straw man perceived.
<br>
&lt;IA-P&gt;    Incorrect attribution perceived
<br>
etc ...
<br>
<p>Just some thoughts.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch

Subject: META: Time to enforce the List Rules!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We seem to have forgotten about the list rules.  During recent discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about how to &quot;fix&quot; the list, I realized that it isn't broken.  We simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aren't following the rules or keeping the promises we have made when we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subscribed to the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Specifically, personal attacks, libelous statements, ad hominem, character
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks, and insults are already disallowed.  We have all promised not to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use these tactics on the list.  Even those who believe that one or more of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these tactics should be allowed have promised not to utilize them within
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this forum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Furthermore, we have all agreed not to defend ourselves on-line when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacked.  We have unanimously agreed that in the interest of improving
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; list signal-to-noise ratio that we will divert all personal defenses
</em><br>
offlist
<br>
<em>&gt; to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!">e_shaun@extropy.org</a> for an off-line resolution.  Even if someone tries
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; start a personal battle, it should end right there with the response going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off-line.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lastly, even if the participants of the battle insist on fighting in
</em><br>
public,
<br>
<em>&gt; the rest of us do not need to put up with it.  It only takes a single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; request to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!">e_shaun@extropy.org</a> to request that the list rules to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enforced.  If nobody makes a complaint, it implies that we unanimously
</em><br>
want
<br>
<em>&gt; the personal attacks to be allowed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have reviewed the list rules again and intend to start obeying them
</em><br>
again.
<br>
<em>&gt; I will stop responding to baseless accusations or trying to defend myself,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but will merely send a request to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!">e_shaun@extropy.org</a> to enforce the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing list rules.  This is what the list rules require.  This is what
</em><br>
we
<br>
<em>&gt; have all promised to do.  I intend to start keeping my promise to obey the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list rules.  I encourage others to do the same.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have a few rules about how you interact with the list. Your continued
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subscription indicates your acceptance of these rules. We do not like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules for their own sake. The List rules are just those we believe will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep the level of discussion high and polite.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PERSONAL ATTACKS: We do not allow personal attacks or libelous statements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those violating this rule may be removed from the List without notice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Those guilty of an ad hominem attack (i.e.: attacking the character of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; poster rather than combating the argument the poster proffers) will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject to a private warning on a first offense and a temporary or
</em><br>
permanent
<br>
<em>&gt; ban on each subsequent offense.  Extropy Institute's Executive Team will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determine the duration of said ban.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If someone attacks your character, insults you, or otherwise violates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above rule, do NOT retaliate in like manner. Instead, send us a complaint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!">e_shaun@extropy.org</a>) and take the matter off-list.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; COPYRIGHT: It is a violation of our Rules and United States law to copy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material from copyrighted sources and post them to the List. Short
</em><br>
excerpts
<br>
<em>&gt; and summaries are fine.  Repeated violators of this rule may be
</em><br>
unsubscribed
<br>
<em>&gt; without notice.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ADVERTISING: It is against our rules to advertise or solicit business
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without our permission. Many people online do not want to see
</em><br>
solicitations
<br>
<em>&gt; and sales messages when they are trying to read a high-density discussion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list. Certain kinds of solicitation may be permitted, but our permission
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must first be obtained. Violation of this rule may result in termination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of your subscription. [Personal professional announcements or discussion
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; personal professional activities are appropriate to the list, if they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; generally relate to the over-all subject matter discussed there.]

<em>&gt; This is a private forum. We reserve the right to unsubscribe anyone at any

</em><br>
<em>&gt; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enjoyable forum.
