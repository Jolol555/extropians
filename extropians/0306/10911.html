<p>Most people would (after some initial icky moments), in my view, because

it's a non-transitive situation. But the question to me, in practical
<br>
terms, might be posed this way:
<br>
<p>Would you spend $100,000 (or whatever it costs) to bring about this
<br>
discontinuous xoxing? It's like the choice of cryonics, but more moot. If
<br>
you're dying anyway, you can't take it with you, but wouldn't it be make
<br>
you happier to bequeath it to your kids, your extended family, or as a
<br>
donation to SIAI, $cientology or the home for disgraced cats? 
<br>
<p>Iff, of course, *you* don't think you'll survive, but merely be copied--and
<br>
bugger what *he* or *she* comes to believe, the self-deluding ninny, after
<br>
the operation and your death.
