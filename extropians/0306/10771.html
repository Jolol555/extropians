<em>&gt;        Umm, this might not hold true. When I left the US 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Navy four years ago, descriptions of rocket-assisted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rounds for 5&quot; inch guns had just started to appear in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; professional literature. The material suggested ranges of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about sixty nautical miles (~68 miles or ~110 km) for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surface targets. Bear in mind, I didn't see these fire. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Military contractors deserve their reputation for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exaggerating their products' abilities.
</em><br>
<p>Any projectile that a cannon can shoot, a railgun can shoot, so any
<br>
rocket assisted round that extends the normal range of a 5&quot; gun will
<br>
also extend the range of a railgun that itself has greater range than a
<br>
conventional 5&quot; cannon. 
<br>
<p>Using dumb warheads as a comparison, the largest gun, the 16&quot; used by
<br>
the now mothballed Missouri-class battleships, had a range of 24 miles.
<br>
This was the longest range chemical propelled gun in the US Navy
<br>
arsenal. A 5&quot; gun with dumb warheads has a range of something around 12
<br>
miles or so. These ranges are with full bore rounds. Using saboted
<br>
rounds will extend the range a bit more
<br>
<p>The only maritime guns of longer range than the Missouri-class 16&quot; guns
<br>
were the 18&quot; guns aboard the Yamato and Musashi superdreadnaughts of
<br>
Imperial Japanese Navy, thought to have a range of about 28-30 miles.
<br>
<p>For longer range guns, you'd need to look at either the WWI and Nazi
<br>
era railroad based guns (the Paris Gun, for example). Otherwise, look
<br>
to the gun research of Canadian Dr. Gerald Bull between the 1960's and
<br>
his 1990 assasination by Israel's Mossad. 
<br>
<p>He designed the &quot;Baby Babylon&quot; gun owned by Saddam Hussein and capable
<br>
of a range of 110 miles (since dismantled), and had designed the
<br>
&quot;Babylon&quot; gun that was designed to put payloads into orbit witha 36
<br>
inch bore. The pieces of this were intercepted by British customs,
<br>
labeled as pipe for oil work, just prior to the first Gulf War.
<br>
<p>Bull used to have two research centers, one on the Vermont/Canadian
<br>
border (where he had the only private border crossings into two
<br>
countries in the world), and one in the Carribean where he did research
<br>
for the US military. He had welded together two 16&quot; bore barrels, end
<br>
to end, to achieve higher exit velocities, and researched saboted
<br>
rounds intended to reach the limit of space.
<br>
<p>In the 1980's, he engaged in commerce with the US and Canadian
<br>
intelligence agencies, supplying Angolan forces fighting against the
<br>
Cubans and their clients with enhanced artillery rounds. US congress
<br>
prevented export of US warheads to Angola, but the Canadians did not.
<br>
Bull bought surplus US warheads, shipped via Burlington, VT, emptied
<br>
and remachined them to his specs, filled them and shipped them out via
<br>
Montreal. When this project came to public knowledge, they (the intel
<br>
agents) left him swinging in the breeze and he spent a year in prison,
<br>
after which, the only work he could find was working for Saddam and
<br>
South African military concerns (he designed the mobile artillery
<br>
vehicle known as the &quot;Kalahari Ferrari&quot;).
