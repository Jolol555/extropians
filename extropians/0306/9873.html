<p>
As long as we're talking about investments, I thought I'd point out
<br>
one of my favorite stocks at the moment.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Many extropians will remember Alteon.   Their drug ALT-711 is an
<br>
AGE-breaker.  AGEs (Advanced Glycation End products) are a kind of
<br>
extracellular garbage that build up in many tissues of the body as
<br>
partially burned sugars bond with proteins and make a non-functional
<br>
glue.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
AGEs are implicated in the loss of elasticity in many tissues as we
<br>
age.  In small human and animal studies, ALT-711 has been shown to
<br>
restore some of this lost flexibility.  In particular its been shown
<br>
to restore lost arterial flexibility and thus reduce blood pressure.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Alteon is currently seeking FDA approval for ALT-711 as a blood
<br>
pressure drug.  They're just wrapping up Phase IIb studies.  Phase I
<br>
studies determined basic safety with a small number of patients.
<br>
Phase II studies determine effectiveness at various doses with a few
<br>
hundred patients, and of course also determine safety with this wider
<br>
population.  Phase III studies, the last needed before a drug is
<br>
approved, are even larger safety studies involving thousands of
<br>
patients.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Historically Phase II is the hardest phase to get through.  Only about
<br>
30% of drugs that enter Phase II trials come out of them successfully.
<br>
On the other hand, drugs that make it to Phase III trials have a 70%
<br>
chance of succeeding in them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Alteon is set to release data from the Phase II trials in July or
<br>
August of this year.  The indications are that they'll clear this
<br>
hurdle.  Here's the evidence I base that on:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
1) In smaller studies on both dogs and humans the drug has already
<br>
been shown to reduce blood pressure significantly more than the
<br>
minimum needed for approval.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
2) The drug reduces blood pressure in an entirely new way, so it
<br>
doesn't have to outperform any existing drug on the market to get
<br>
approval.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
3) Between Phase I and Phase II studies, Alteon doubled the maximum
<br>
dosage of the drug, indicating that they feel pretty good about
<br>
safety.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
4) Patients in the Phase II trials have the option to stay on the drug
<br>
after the trial ends.  Alteon is reporting that a large number of
<br>
patients are opting to stay on, which also says good things about
<br>
safety and side-effects.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
5) Alteon's external safety board has not brought any safety issues to
<br>
their attention.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So all told, I believe that in July or August, Alteon will announce
<br>
positive results from their Phase II trials.  At that time I think the
<br>
stock will rise substantially.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As a company, Alteon has enough money to complete Phase II trials and
<br>
operate for a while after that, but not enough to complete expensive
<br>
Phase III trials.  Alteon is currently in talks with major
<br>
pharmaceutical companies to partner on the Phase III trials and
<br>
marketing of the drug.  If they make it through Phase II trials it's
<br>
highly likely that they'll get such a deal.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The potential market for ALT-711 is multiple billions of dollars per
<br>
year.  Alteon's current market cap is around $180 million.  If we
<br>
assume a price / sales ratio of 4 (low for the pharmaceutical /
<br>
biotech industry), and assume that Alteon could be keeping $1 billion
<br>
/ year in sales of ALT-711 after partnership agreements, we get a
<br>
potential $4 billion dollar market cap for the stock 3 years from now,
<br>
IFF the drug clears both Phase II and Phase III trials.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
$4 billion is about 22 times $180 million, suggesting that the stock
<br>
has a lot of potential for positive movement.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Let's try to calculate the fair market cap of the stock right after an
<br>
announcement of success in Phase II trials (which of course hasn't
<br>
happened yet, but which I believe is likely in the next 60 days).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To figure this out we'll discount the eventual market cap of $4
<br>
billion by the likelihood of clearing Phase III trials (70%) and by
<br>
20% per year between now and the drug being on the market (estimate 3
<br>
years).  That gives us $4 billion x 0.7 x 0.8 x 08 x 0.8 = $1.4
<br>
billion, or more than 7 times current market cap.   Even if we
<br>
discount by another 50% to reflect uncertainty over a pharma company
<br>
partnership, potential market for the drug, and so on, we end up with
<br>
a fair market cap 3 or 4 times over the current price of the company.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Now, I don't actually think the stock will go up by a factor of 7 upon
<br>
successful completion.  I do think it will take a healthy jump,
<br>
though.  And I expect that later in the summer or fall Alteon will
<br>
announce a partnership with a major pharmaceutical company, which
<br>
would assure Alteon's survival and will give the stock another jump.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So, that's my long winded way of saying that there's a good short to
<br>
medium term investment opportunity in this stock for those that are
<br>
tolerant of risk.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
To be clear, there *is* a very real risk with the Phase II studies.
<br>
They are not complete.  When the data is unblinded in July or August,
<br>
it could be surprisingly bad.  The larger studies could fail to find a
<br>
statistically significant effect on blood pressure.  There could be
<br>
unexpected safety issues.  The company leadership could all be thrown
<br>
in jail for insider trading or accounting scandals.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
At the same time, just about every indication it's possible to get in
<br>
advance of the completion of Phase II studies is positive.  They all
<br>
point to success in Phase II.  And success in Phase II will almost
<br>
certainly result in a substantial rise in stock price.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
cheers,
<br>
