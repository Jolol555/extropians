<em>&gt; Kevin, I am indeed continuing my education in computing, but I also realize

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  Software architecture/design is not a matter of mere 
<br>
knowledge.   We don't know precisely what it takes to produce such people and 
<br>
they are at a premium.  Of course, to compensate projects sometimes just 
<br>
&quot;bang on it till it more or less works&quot;.    The results speak for themselves.  
<br>
Bottom line, stay close to what your heart loves.  You want have much of an 
<br>
edge or be happy otherwise.  Don't just go for the money.   It kills 
<br>
creativity. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Regarding sales positions,  the lead story of the Wall Street Journal on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Weds, June 11 2003,  was the trend in corporate thinking is to eliminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; higher paid people from jobs and replace them with lower paid workers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; According to the article, this is apparently not illegal to do so. This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurred at Circuit City, nationally. What I sense from some of the people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list is a &quot;trust in capitalism, not reason&quot; and judging by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behaviors of the corporations, this seems to be the case.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Assuming the quality of the results are good, the action itself is perfectly 
<br>
rational.  Full of undesirable effects as long as we are driven primariy by 
<br>
profit and jobs alone, though.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This may be a self-correcting problem, in the sense that when there are not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough people to afford to purchase goods and services, a lot of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stockholders will demand retribution on the boards of directors, for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decline in the value of their stocks, as the economy tanks. Call it  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Darwinian Principle in action. What is left of the United States after this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; process completes is another story.
</em><br>
<p>Our apparent success is largely based on some dicey book keeping when you 
<br>
consider the true Federal Debt and that we are headed into deflation with no 
<br>
margin to play normal monetarist tweaking games.
