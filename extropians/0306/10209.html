<em>&gt; In a message dated 6/14/2003 6:54:47 PM Central Standard Time,

<em>&gt; <a href="mailto:matus@matus1976.com?Subject=RE:%20Am%20I%20dishonest?%20(was%20RE:%20How%20best%20to%20spend%20US$200%20billion?)">matus@matus1976.com</a> writes:

<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question One: Does anyone else on the list feel that the current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnamese government is a legitimate one?  Note I will not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacking those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who express this opinion, I am just curious how prevalent this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion is on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this list.  Samantha, do YOU feel the current communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government of Vietnam is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a legitimate one?  Does anyone on this list (besides Jeff) feel as much?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answers with a question.  Is anyone silly enough to think the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything less than a cash cow for the criminal syndicate that controls it.
</em><br>
<p>I take that as a 'no, the vietnamese govt is not legit.'
<br>
<p>So far that is two 'NO's, if you feel the Vietnamese govt is legit, please
<br>
speak up!
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question Two: Jeff makes various assertions about my debating abilities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including claiming that many of my 'facts' are inventions of my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideology, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonest and insulting, incoherent, I am not qualified to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discuss political
</em><br>
<em>&gt; topics, undisciplined, lack effort, responsibility, and skill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In addition, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have no capacity or inclination to distinguish fact from fantasy,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and no logical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coherence, and that Jeff will refrain from responding to me until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I get better
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at 'thinking about such matters' With that I mind, I submit humbly to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list the question, do others feel this is an accurate description
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my presence
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Answer, As to whether or not you occasionally fall from grace I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't say.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have never noticed you doing anything that was a major
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transgression from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules of good sportsmanship.  Most of your time is spent exposing Jeff's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tactics.  I say that with a certain admiration for Jeff's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expertise at that game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -- he and my ex mother in law could gain employment teaching the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Marine Corps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dirty fighting.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        The level of your debating skills would no doubt show an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apparent (but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not real) improvement in a debate between gentlemen.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron h.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Ron, thanks for you positive comments, I take them to be you generally do
<br>
not agree with Jeff's description of my mailing list presence.  However,
<br>
since we tend to almost always agree on matters of politics, I am afraid
<br>
others will find it difficult to take your evaluation of me as objective,
<br>
though I value your comments.
<br>
<p>I would still be interested in hearing from other members of the mailing
<br>
list on this, hopefully ones that generally do not partake in debates with
<br>
me, but have perhaps read through some of my discussions.
<br>
<p>So far, Spike and Ron are the only ones to have responded, if the majority
<br>
of this list felt that I was a dishonest debater, and I honestly asked as
<br>
much, I suspect they would readily tell me as much.  If you feel Jeff's
<br>
comments are generally true of me, please speak up! I welcome opportunities
<br>
to better myself.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
