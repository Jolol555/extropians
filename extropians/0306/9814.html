<p>
I wish I had the time to read all the posts on this list, but I don't
<br>
What I do is skim, read as many posts by people I know and/or admire as
<br>
I can, and take a look at things to which my attention is drawn by
<br>
offlist communication.  The latter drew my attention to a recent
<br>
re-occurrence of inflamed rhetoric here surrounding words about the Iraq
<br>
war.
<br>
<p>I don't have a lot of time this morning, but I'll make a comment as a
<br>
professional rhetorician.  In my work as a trial lawyer, I've had to
<br>
deal with some very unpleasant subjects in public speaking and writing:
<br>
Painful death, fraud, professional negligence, bankruptcy.  Crucial
<br>
elements of carrying on a civilized discussion about such topics are
<br>
respect for one's audience and toning the rhetoric DOWN as the
<br>
inflammatory nature of the subject matter goes UP.  Failure to observe
<br>
these principles INEVITABLY leads to a degradation of the entire
<br>
discourse and, ultimately, failure to communicate effectively.
<br>
<p>Another rule -- that rises to the level of a natural law in my book --
<br>
is that effective communication and economy of words go hand in hand.
<br>
As someone who spends a LOT of time these days editing the writing and
<br>
coaching the oral presentations of journeymen lawyers, my number one
<br>
tool is the knife: I cut, cut, cut.  Often the best advice I give to
<br>
young lawyers is to say NOTHING: You've made your point, now SHUT UP;
<br>
let the other guy bore and offend the judge or jury with his incessant
<br>
blathering and repetitive hammering.   Finally, seventeen years of law
<br>
practice has led me to observe another near-natural-law: The
<br>
persuasiveness of rhetoric is in inverse proportion to the number of
<br>
adjectives used.  Saying something is &quot;clear&quot; doesn't make it so, and
<br>
describing something as &quot;horrible&quot; doesn't evoke horror in one's
<br>
audience. I now issue &quot;adjective licenses&quot; to my young lawyers, which I
<br>
revoke with zeal at the slightest infraction.
<br>
<p>Please consider these observations.
