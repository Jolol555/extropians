<p>I see that Martha Stewart's lawyer has published a letter which claims the
<br>
federal indictment does not, as you say, include the original charge of
<br>
trading on inside information about the ImClone drug being rejected by the
<br>
FDA. www.marthatalks.com
<br>
<p>Very interesting if true. I don't know if that is only her lawyer's legal
<br>
spin, (she was after all indicted on five counts of securities fraud, and I
<br>
find it hard to believe that none of them pertain to the timing of her sale
<br>
of ImClone stock), but according to her lawyer the government is prosecuting
<br>
Stewart for obstructing an investigation that proved her to be innocent!
<br>
<p>Looks like confusion caused by over-zealous government interference in free
<br>
markets.
<br>
<p>I would vote to abolish the SEC, and the FDA as well. Actually I have
<br>
already done so (voted for Harry Browne last time around).
