This system claims to have averaged 17.7% annual return since 1973.  And
<br>
I don't think you'd say that it exceeds average risk!  Although
<br>
dividends in the past were taxed with the president new tax bill getting
<br>
passed these stocks whould be even more attractive.  As the baby boomers
<br>
retire more will look to these dividends as supplementing their social
<br>
security.  I wish I had followed this system instead of being greedy and
<br>
investing exclusively in technology stocks!

<p>Looking for a simple strategy for selecting high dividend yield Dow
<br>
stocks for your investment portfolio? Try Dogs of the Dow. Read on and
<br>
you will discover a strategy that would have given you a 17.7% average
<br>
annual return since 1973! That's not bad, especially considering that
<br>
the Dow Jones Industrial Average overall return was 11.9% during that
<br>
same period. (As reported in U.S. News &amp; World Report, July 8, 1996) 
<br>
And what has happened lately... 
<br>
<p>During the tech bubble of the late 90s, the Dogs of the Dow was up 28.6%
<br>
in 1996, up 22.2% in 1997, up 10.7% in 1998, and up 4.0% in 1999. During
<br>
the difficult bear market years of 2000 - 2002, the Dogs of the Dow was
<br>
up 6.4% in 2000, down 4.9% in 2001, and down 8.9% in 2002, and that was
<br>
enough to significantly outperform the Dow, S&amp;P 500, and Nasdaq.

<p>There is no shortage of people who believe they have a theory for
<br>
beating the market. The P/E ratio theory (buy when P/E is low and sell
<br>
when P/E is
<br>
high) is as old as the hills. It doesn't work after adjusting for risk. 
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, nothing works for beating the market after adjusting for
<br>
risk. 
<br>
<p>There are on the other hand a million ways to beat the market averages
<br>
if you're willing to assume more than average risk.
