<p>Must one apply so much pressure to a single word?
<br>
I think that you knew what I meant.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;But I

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;telling them &quot;this really is the same person&quot;, the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that this delusion will become common, because operationally, from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the outside, you *will* be dealing with the same person (or an improved
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; memories as the original. That's built in to the premise.
</em><br>
<p>What evidence do you have that this is a delusion?  The
<br>
whole point of some recent posters was that nothing can
<br>
be proved either way.  I guess you disagree with them 
<br>
too, but coming from the opposite direction from me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;&quot;I still think that all you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;are zombies&quot;, the old guy will say, &quot;all this teleporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;and duplicating and what not&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Only if he's an idiot. Obviously exact duplicates are *not* zombies, any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more than new children are zombies. The only real question is whether you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will *sacrifice yourself for your duplicate*. Many people on this list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ironically enough, have enough Rand in their memetic substrate that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regard the idea of self-sacrifice as noxious and wicked.
</em><br>
<p>Okay, I RETRACT the word sacrifice.  Period.
<br>
<p>A unit, I claim can select that it be destroyed, and
<br>
this is no sacrifice.  The same person will still live,
<br>
and it will be a wise decision for this person to have
<br>
adopted the philosophy that rejects that he is simply
<br>
an instance.
<br>
<p>I think that you would be sorely tempted to begin teleporting
<br>
if almost everyone else did.  And after you did a few times...
<br>
well, it just wouldn't be so hard anymore.
