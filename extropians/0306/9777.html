<br>
<p>I recall hearing, once, about a force field effect
<br>
achieved with supersonic jets of water (supersonic
<br>
with respect to the speed of sound in water, anyway).
<br>
It had to be carefully crafted to make sure the water
<br>
made a flush seal with the surrouding material, and
<br>
of course it had to be made of stuff that could stand
<br>
up to such a jet (one could use such a jet to, say,
<br>
cut meat, without worrying about metal shattering
<br>
should the water blade hit bone), but it kept air and
<br>
vacuum apart, and repelled casual attempts at piercing
<br>
(reacting to a finger poke as if it were solid, for
<br>
example).  I don't think they tested it against
<br>
bullets, though; I wonder how effective, pound for
<br>
pound, such a system would be as compared to modern
<br>
armor?  (Even if super-effective, it would have at
<br>
least two drawbacks: needs power and water to operate
<br>
- although most of the water would be recycled, there
<br>
would probably be some minimal water wastage, no
<br>
matter how well designed the system - and inescapable
<br>
weak points for the frame of the field - although said
<br>
points, being a small fraction of the area protected,
<br>
could themselves use heavy conventional armor.
<br>
Advantage: even if a single shot manages to penetrate
<br>
the field - other than at these weak points - the
<br>
armor regenerates before another bullet can come
<br>
along.)
