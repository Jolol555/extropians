<p>Allow me to counter your view.  Your comments were the popular
<br>
interpretation amongst libertarians (including me) just after 9/11.  There
<br>
is a compelling case amongst middle eastern people to dislike the US and the
<br>
west, and you correctly note some of those concerns.  However, the popular
<br>
disdain for the US in these instances ignores the geo-politcal climate at
<br>
the time, especially concerning actions since WWII.
<br>
<p>Concerning your comments on Isreal, I would note there is a growing member
<br>
of the palestenian people that seek life under democratic Isreal rule,
<br>
considering palestinians in Isreal have the right to vote (which no other
<br>
Arabs in the middle east do) and are not conscripted into the Israel
<br>
military (which Jewish citizens are) The pro-isreal democratic members of
<br>
the palestinians face continued terrorist harrasement and assaults by the
<br>
racist pro-palestinian state activists who as the PA and Arafat are no less
<br>
than an oppressive dictatorial regime idealogically opposed to living under
<br>
an Isreali state.  A promiment member of this group was shot five times
<br>
allegedly by Arafat thugs.  But isreal is the only bad guy, and arafat won a
<br>
noble peace prize, sorry, I forgot.
<br>
<p>Palestinians are brainwashed and coerced by arafat and his despotic PLO
<br>
regime into blaming isreal for everthing and convincing them to kill as many
<br>
israel children as possible.  Arafat is the dictator of the Palestinian
<br>
Authority in everyway but in official title, palestinians live in constant
<br>
fear of having their property arbitrarily confiscated by arafat's corrupt
<br>
'police' force, laws prohibiting free speech are enforced brutally.  Mayor
<br>
Zuhir Hamden publicly stated his villagers live not under Arafat but Under
<br>
Isreal, he was subsequenty shot five times.  Do you think he was shot by
<br>
Isreal troops?
<br>
<p>&quot;Zuhair Hamdan, founder of the Movement for Coexistence in Jerusalem, was
<br>
sitting on a chair outside his corner shop near Bethlehem in November when
<br>
an official Palestinian Authority car drew up with a squeal of brakes. From
<br>
the back window a gunman, who Mr. Hamdan says was a member of the gang,
<br>
emptied 12 bullets from a M-16 rifle, hitting him five times in the abdomen,
<br>
legs and neck.&quot;
<br>
<p>from - <a href="http://www.likud.nl/extr200.html">http://www.likud.nl/extr200.html</a>
<br>
<p>The debate over the moral justification of actions in Palestinine is no
<br>
doubt a long and detailed one, but do not pretend the Isreal people and
<br>
nation are the only perpetrators against the Palestinain people.  The
<br>
palestinian people are subtly ruled by a murderous racist brainwashing
<br>
regime, they would have been far better off under the democratic rule of
<br>
Isreal.
<br>
<p>What occupation -
<br>
<a href="http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=2053">http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=2053</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;during the three decades of Israel's control, far fewer Palestinians were
<br>
killed at Jewish hands than by King Hussein of Jordan in the single month of
<br>
September 1970 when, fighting off an attempt by Yasir Arafat's PLO to
<br>
destroy his monarchy, he dispatched (according to the Palestinian scholar
<br>
Yezid Sayigh) between 3,000 and 5,000 Palestinians, among them anywhere from
<br>
1,500 to 3,500 civilians&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;&quot;If the occupation was the cause of terrorism, why was terrorism sparse
<br>
during the years of actual occupation, why did it increase dramatically with
<br>
the prospect of the end of the occupation, and why did it escalate into open
<br>
war upon Israel's most far-reaching concessions ever?&quot;
<br>
<p>Palestenian and Arab extremism - <a href="http://www.likud.nl/extr.html">http://www.likud.nl/extr.html</a>
<br>
<p>Nevertheless, assuming the pre WWII reasons you cite for their continued
<br>
hating of the west are valid, what would you suggest we do about that?
<br>
Re-assemble the ottoman empire?  Have Europe and France pay post-colonial
<br>
repirations?  The fact is those things can not be undone.  In any case, the
<br>
downplay the 'they hate us for who we are' scenerio is intellectual
<br>
dishonesty.  They hate us for what we have done AND who we are.  What we
<br>
have done will never go away, it will always be something we have done, and
<br>
they will continue to hate us for who we are, unless you plan on changine
<br>
who we are or what we have done, I dont see how your comments will help lead
<br>
to a resolution.  The corrupt leaders of Arab regimes are foreced to choose
<br>
between blaiming the ills of the arab peoples on themselves and their
<br>
failure to embrace modernity or to blame it on the west.  Which do you think
<br>
is easier to teach, and which do you think the Arab leaders have a greater
<br>
motivation to preach?
<br>
<p>I suggest reading the wonderfully enlighteing Essay posted a few times on
<br>
this list
<br>
<p>ISLAM'S WAR AGAINST THE WEST from - <a href="http://www.howardbloom.net/islam.htm">http://www.howardbloom.net/islam.htm</a>
<br>
<p>And see if you still believe that radical Islam only hates the west because
<br>
of 'what we did'
<br>
