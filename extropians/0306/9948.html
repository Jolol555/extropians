<em>&gt; &gt; Regards from the Kill Files
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I never had and never will have such a device as a kill file. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I do read the postings of people whose opinions are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diametrically oppposed to mine. I even believe it is cynical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to put people in a virtual trap and call it kill file.
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes useful when dealing with tarts and twits IMHO.
<br>
I usually judge whether somebody should be kill-filed according
<br>
to their ability to hold and discuss an intelligible thought, and of
<br>
course, honesty in a discussion :P
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ....&lt;snip&gt; If you don't FEEL - yes, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extropian buzz word - that you are deathly wrong and that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you (plural) were fucked up by your humble servants called 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush administration, there is nothing I can do to bring you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back on the path of decency.
</em><br>
<p>Mate, I sympathize :) I'm stateside and I can't really understand
<br>
The numbers and approval ratings being touted by the Republicans.
<br>
I'm inclined to think they're fabricated/heavily massaged, UNTIL
<br>
I see falwell come on CNN and give an interview where he states
<br>
That the MidEast problem is progressing nicely for the second-coming of
<br>
Christ,
<br>
Or I go on Chat/IRC on a political channel, and actually interact with
<br>
some of these religious right wing nuts with 0 capacity for analytical
<br>
Thinking, 0 knowledge of history, or even a rudimentary ethical
<br>
System despite they're repeated claims to moral superiority...
<br>
Its really sad.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am sick and tired of this American madness to be a winner 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all the time. I wish, you as a nation might relax a bit and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leave the world in peace with your eternal winner attitude.
</em><br>
<p>Hahahahaha :) Hardly likely.  Its even funnier when you consider
<br>
That half the time Americans don't even know what they're competing
<br>
For, or why.  Personally, I'ld support a permanent thorazine drip
<br>
For 80% of the US population :P  Supplanted by a VERY LONG forced 
<br>
Sojourn in some of the countries they've helped &quot;build&quot; in the last
<br>
quarter
<br>
Century.  That would be an excellent start.
<br>
<p>omard-out
<br>
PS&gt; since I'm new to the list (but not the digest), and usually somewhat
<br>
inflammatory 
<br>
in that I do like discussing controversial issues, I would like to add I
<br>
am not a troll.
<br>
<p>I take such issues very seriously, insofar that current policies in
<br>
place a)distract
<br>
from more significant issues, like death, disease, of course fair trade
<br>
and extension of 
<br>
human knowledge b) indirectly affect me in those areas (fairly
<br>
negatively so far I might 
<br>
add across the board)....
<br>
<p>Anyway, hello :)
<br>
