<p>As is often the case, I agree with Lee's logic, but not necessarily the
<br>
direction in which he aims it.  For example, Lee's concept of multiple
<br>
instances of Lee corbin is logically consistent as he defines self, but to
<br>
me it is simpler and more aesthetic and practical to consider all those
<br>
multiple instances of Lee Corbin as individuals who go off on their own into
<br>
the world becoming more and more their own selves as time goes on.
<br>
<p>Before anyone says &quot;Hey!, you just said in an earlier post that the self
<br>
doesn't exist.&quot;  Well it certainly does exist -- at the particular context
<br>
level where we're talking about individuals and society, but not in the
<br>
bigger picture where we go looking for its origin.
<br>
<p>The same thing is true of consciousness, self, altruism, and free will.  At
<br>
the context level of the human and society, they can usefully be said to
<br>
exist, but in the wider and more inclusive picture these concepts no longer
<br>
apply but are seen to fit together perfectly within their lower level
<br>
context.
