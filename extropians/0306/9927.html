<p>I don't believe this advice makes much sense in a time of radically increasing 
<br>
change and volatility.  It becomes much more delicate to predict which 
<br>
companies are going to be around for the long haul.   Too many good companies 
<br>
are now dead or dying with their stock price less than half a penny on the 
<br>
dollar of when they were purchased if they are alive at all.  At even highly 
<br>
optimistic yearly growth it would take more years for such stocks to come 
<br>
back to par value than I have before I retire.  It would be very foolish to 
<br>
take long side risk on such.    A rule of thumb that makes sense to me:  If 
<br>
you had the money in hand today that you have in this investment would you 
<br>
buy this instrument?  If the answer is &quot;No&quot; then sell at least half of it 
<br>
immediately.
