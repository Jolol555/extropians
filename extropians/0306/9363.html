</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;still, you have to count the DA as evidence in the negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;direction.  And that's all that the DA asks, that you take it into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;consideration and revise your estimates downward.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I fully agree here. The DA should indeed reduce the estimate I might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have of our civilization surviving much longer.
</em><br>
<p>As near as I can figure, the DA should have *no* impact on our estimates. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;It is not *any* kind of evidence.
<br>
<p>Suppose that you have two barrels; one barrel contains a billion 
<br>
billiards, and the other barrel contains ten billiards.  The billiards in 
<br>
each barrel are sequentially numbered - in the first barrel, the billiards 
<br>
are numbered from one to a billion; in the second barrel, the billiards 
<br>
are numbered from one to ten.
<br>
<p>Suppose that the billiards are self-aware observers.  A billiard numbered 
<br>
'5' can look at itself and reason:  &quot;Gee, I'm numbered '5'!  What a 
<br>
surprise!  Now how likely is *that*, if I'm not in the second barrel? 
<br>
It's got to be virtually certain that I'm in the second barrel!  Such a 
<br>
tremendous surprise has to be evidence for *something*!&quot;
<br>
<p>But we *know* this is wrong.  Within the whole physical universe of 
<br>
discourse, two billiards reason this way.  Two billiards have these 
<br>
thoughts.  Of these two billiards, one is in the first barrel and one is 
<br>
in the second barrel.  Whatever line of reasoning they carry out, it 
<br>
should end in the conclusion:  50/50.  You can argue about what line of 
<br>
reasoning this is, whether it amounts to the Self-Indication Assumption or 
<br>
something else, but if a chain of reasoning ends with anything other than 
<br>
50/50, it is not well-calibrated.
<br>
<p>Please note that nobody is &quot;picking&quot; a billiard &quot;at random&quot;, or &quot;picking&quot; 
<br>
a barrel &quot;at random&quot;, or anything of that sort.  The barrels, and 
<br>
billiards, just *are*.  Let's say there are a hundred barrels, fifty big 
<br>
barrels with a billion billards, fifty small barrels with ten billiards. 
<br>
A hundred billiards are numbered '5'.  Fifty are in big barrels, fifty are 
<br>
in little barrels.  A billiard that looks at itself and finds the number 
<br>
'5' is a cognitive pointer state that points to a big barrel in fifty 
<br>
cases and points to a little barrel in fifty cases.  So if these cognitive 
<br>
entities come to any conclusion other than &quot;50% probability&quot;, they are 
<br>
not, in fact, well-calibrated.
<br>
<p>Forget the whole question of sentient beings being picked &quot;at random&quot; from 
<br>
some distribution or other.  Sentient beings aren't picked.  They just are.
