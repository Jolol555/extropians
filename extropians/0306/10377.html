</em><br>

<p>Yes, someone who has really adopted goals that are very different from the 
<br>
goals evolution has given him, and/or who lives in a world very different 
<br>
from the world evolution adapted to, may well want to rely much more on 
<br>
trying to be rational.  But you have to get pretty far into your 
<br>
singulatarian world view to make this argument, which then becomes 
<br>
unpersuasive to the vast majority of humanity.  For most people, who expect 
<br>
to live an ordinary lifespan, who have the usual goals that most people do, 
<br>
and who have the usual expectations about future trends, your argument has 
<br>
very little purchase.  Most people accept the goals evolution has given 
<br>
them, a standard mix of wanting food, status, children, etc.  And the 
<br>
social world they expect to live in isn't really that different from the 
<br>
social world that evolution expects, at least regarding these 
<br>
issues.  Given those assumptions, it seems quite reasonable for them to 
<br>
&quot;Just be Natural.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...  Even if we suppose that it might *turn out* to make sense to deceive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;yourself *in that instance*... how's J. Layman Boyfriend supposed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;compute that answer?  If he is ignorant enough to still have the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opportunity of self-deception, how can he possibly know enough to figure 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;out whether self-deception is safe?
</em><br>
<p>He doesn't know.  He just acts, naturally.  And for all of his ancestors, 
<br>
this was the right thing to do.
<br>
<p>Now I actually do think that the world our descendants will live in within 
<br>
the next century may well be different enough that acting with the usual 
<br>
level of self-deception may lead to very bad outcomes.  So I personally can 
<br>
accept this as a strong argument for seeking truth.  (And I even once had 
<br>
this argument in my self-deception paper.)  But for most audiences, this is 
<br>
a very weak argument.  And my original claim was just that I could only 
<br>
find disappointingly weak arguments for believing truth.
