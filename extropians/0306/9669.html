One dimension which the article
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/pavlik2.html">http://www.lewrockwell.com/orig/pavlik2.html</a>&gt;, which
<br>
Jeff Davis ((<a href="mailto:jrd1415@yahoo.com?Subject=RE:%20Lew%20Rockwell.com">jrd1415@yahoo.com</a>)
<br>
Date: Sat Jun 07 2003 - 16:00:50 MDT) transcluded for
<br>
us, omitted was the critical transition from OSS to
<br>
CIA.
<br>
<p>Ian Masters &lt;ianmasters.org&gt;, some years ago, on his
<br>
regular Sunday morning &quot;Background Briefing,&quot;*
<br>
interviewed the man who was in charge of the OSS
<br>
operation behind enemy lines in fascist Italy during
<br>
WWII.  According to this witness, the following
<br>
scenario played itself out:
<br>
<p>The OSS had built up a library of solid sources,
<br>
operatives and experience throughout Europe.  This was
<br>
largely lost when the CIA took over under Truman. 
<br>
Desperate for info, the CIA amateurs took what they
<br>
could get, which turned out to largely consist of
<br>
former Nazi's, Fascists and both former and current
<br>
Checka/KGB assets, all of whom had various mixtures of
<br>
motives.  
<br>
<p>One long-term motive for many of these &quot;assets&quot; was to
<br>
maintain an environment in which their value as an
<br>
asset outweighed the need to expose or prosecute them
<br>
for war crimes.  Thus, both sides - CIA and KGB - fell
<br>
unwittingly into a collaboration, maintained by this
<br>
clique of professional assets, to manufacture and/or
<br>
maintain the state of hostilities we refer to as the
<br>
&quot;Cold War.&quot;
<br>
<p>In many, many cases, these war criminals ended up
<br>
getting slotted right back into positions in the
<br>
post-war governments throughout Europe, but especially
<br>
in Germany and Italy, similar to those that they had
<br>
held during WWII.  And if someone recognized and tried
<br>
to expose them, well, of course there were ways to
<br>
deal with them, and both sides had a vested interest
<br>
in not allowing the true nature of what they were now
<br>
locked into becoming public.
<br>
<p>Thus, a substantial part of the fascist/NAZI
<br>
infrastructure was put back into place and allowed to
<br>
function for decades as a constant source of fuel for
<br>
the mutual paranoia of East vs. West, to the advantage
<br>
of both CIA and KGB career builders.  Or so this man
<br>
claimed.
<br>
<p>*Ian will probably not be on the air, either internet
<br>
or broadcast, this weekend, as the entire weekend has
<br>
apparently been given over to promoting the most
<br>
virulent possible expressions of racism, sexism and
<br>
homophobia imaginable - the &quot;Progressive&quot; idea of
<br>
celebrating our &quot;African American Heritage.&quot;
