<em>&gt; &gt; We are all harmed by misrepresentation.  It hurts the quality of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dialog here on this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I should make clear that this thread is far from the only one where these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; kinds of tactics are being used.  In fact, I see the quality of almost all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of our political discussions as being atrocious, full of name-calling and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rhetorical trickery.  Complaining about all of them would be a full time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; job, which I am not willing to take on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I am not sure what to do about it.  Something needs to change.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no reason why we can't accuse each other of crimes against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity, treason and make other horrible claims in a calm, civilized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner without resorting to rhetorical trickery.
</em><br>
<p>I've been absent from the list a few weeks.  But on quick
<br>
inspection, perhaps it does seem to have deteriorated a bit.
<br>
But I think that your last sentence should be taken both
<br>
literally and very seriously---and I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; On this list we claim to be willing to explore novel technologies.  Yet we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; engage in exactly the same styles of pointless rhetorical battling that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you can find in any other forum on the net.  What is Extropian about how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we handle political disagreements?  Nothing.  We just yell at each other.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes.  We all need to grow up, transcend, and really act in an extropian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manner....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But how?
</em><br>
<p>Hmm.  Well, (a) it has to be voluntary  (b) we must accept that no
<br>
realistic solution will work perfectly (and as engineers, many of
<br>
us are going to find this DIFFICULT), and (c) it must have broad
<br>
appeal cutting across most religious, philosophic, and other
<br>
partisan lines.
<br>
<p>I propose a pledge.  We could start by debating certain ideals that
<br>
are much more down-to-earth and concrete than the Extropian ideals.
<br>
These would seek to &quot;govern&quot; (in the loosest possible sense of
<br>
the term) the manner of debate here.  (Besides, it would be vastly
<br>
interesting to see if such ideals could be agreed upon in the first
<br>
place.)
<br>
<p>Then, perhaps, if some general agreement was reached, one's
<br>
on-line &quot;signing&quot; of the pledge might give one little pause
<br>
when retaliating against the latest outrage from the other side.
<br>
<p>Just an idea.
<br>
<p>But I cannot refrain from immediately proposing three.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge that most posters are of fundamentally good
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will, and sound mind, and despite having from time to time
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gone beyond the limits of good taste, and despite having
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;over-reacted to others' posts, they are capable---even my
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bitterest ideological adversaries, as well as myself---of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doing better.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge that no identifiable political or philosophical
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;position has a monopoly on truth and rightness, including
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mine.  Extremely intelligent and highly moral people of all
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;persuasions can be found (perhaps amazingly) holding almost
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any position whatsoever.  Therefore, I will conduct myself
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in as high-minded manner as I can, especially in refraining
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from name-calling and ad hominem remarks, and will strive to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;address other posters respectfully.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will try to avoid using the list as an emotional outlet,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;instead merely to state the truth as I see it, and point out,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;both courteously and politely what appear to me to be the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mistaken philosophies and conjectures of those I disagree with.
