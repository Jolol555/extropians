<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;Certainly, I can understand why a 13-year-old would think that (most

<em>&gt; &gt; Also remember that this boy is still in the formative stages gathering

given
<br>

and
<br>

</em><br>

replace
<br>

</em><br>
<p>### There is something to it. Although nowhere as smart as the subject of
<br>
our discussion, I remember screaming and kicking not to go to church at age
<br>
7 (engaging in an actual physical contest with my mother who was trying to
<br>
bodily drag me to the Sunday mass), quitting catechism lessons at age 8, and
<br>
openly and publicly rejecting religion not long afterwards, but it was only
<br>
a bit later that my reasoning became more organized and refined than a
<br>
simple assertion of independence from my parents. Everybody has his own
<br>
schedule.
