<p>As you say, this goes to the heart of the nature of rationality.  There is 
<br>
the standard paradox of &quot;How long should I think about which car to buy&quot;, 
<br>
&quot;How long should I think about how long to think about what car to buy&quot;, 
<br>
and so on.  While a fully rational calculation should be more complex at 
<br>
each meta level, you clearly must think for less time at each meta level, 
<br>
and so at some level you are really not being very rational at all.  At 
<br>
some level you just act, without having an explicit analysis to say why.
<br>
<p>The situation of evolved creatures with the possibility of costly rational 
<br>
analysis seems similar to me.  They usually just act based on evolved 
<br>
habits, but sometimes they decide to pay the cost to be more rational about 
<br>
some choice.  But they can't be very rational about that choice of when to 
<br>
be rational.  At some level there is just the evolved habit, which may or 
<br>
may not be appropriate to the particular situation.
