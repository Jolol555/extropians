<em>&gt; It is probably not fractured. There is not much you can do about it if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is. You don't plaster a broken toe. It is immobilized by strapping to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adjacent toes.
</em><br>
<p>Personal experence, I Am Not An MD, etc.:
<br>
<p>Or sometimes not even that. When I broke a big toe the doctors gave me a 
<br>
&quot;frankenfoot&quot; (my name for a sort of easily-donned canvas shoe with a thick 
<br>
stiff sole), so that when I walked, I wouldn't flex the toe(s) as much, and 
<br>
told me to &quot;stay off it&quot;.
<br>
<p>As if one can do that.
<br>
<p>The musculoskeletal effects of walking with the single thick-soled splint 
<br>
on were so bad, I gave up and went to wearing a pair of hardsoled hiking 
<br>
boots. The pain getting them on an off was much more tolerable to me than 
<br>
the spine, hip, knee and leg effects of having one funny shoe on.
<br>
<p>Icing the toe frequently immediately following the incident would have been 
<br>
a good idea.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would have it checked out - just to see about the trephine, at least.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, black under the toenail suggests a possible lanceable hematoma to me.

<em>&gt;&gt; I need advise on extropic care for a broken toe. (seriously :-))
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; I dropped a very hard piece of laminate flooring on my toe and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; think it is fractured above the joint.  My toe nail is black and blue
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; and my toe is very red and swollen.  It is extremely sensitive and I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; can't walk on it.  I feel a lot of pressure at the toe - like it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; going to burst - and am wondering if I should go to the doctor or
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just let it be and it will heal on its own.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Any and all suggestions are welcome.  (You can email me privately.)
