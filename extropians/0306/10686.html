<em>&gt;Yes, of course Bayesians can disagree about values, about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they want to have happen.  Whether this lets them disagree about
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who some property &quot;belongs&quot; to depends on whether we are talking

<em>&gt;about values, who do I wish it would belong to, or facts, who
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in fact owns the property according to some set of legal rules.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I can understand Bayesians holding different values, but I don't
<br>
understand how that enables disagreement. What stops them from rephrasing
<br>
their differences along these lines: the values that the Cherokee people
<br>
want to maximise are best served by killing any white man who claims to
<br>
own the land, and the values held by the group of white men who want the
<br>
land are maximised by killing the Cherokee (I changed the value differences
<br>
a bit to make it easier to describe them with less ambiguity and to make
<br>
it clear that I'm assuming no compromise involving a monetary payment would
<br>
eliminate the dispute).
<br>
&nbsp;One possible answer I thought of was that nothing requires them to
<br>
notice that they are using &quot;belongs&quot; in ways that are ambiguous and
<br>
inconsistent. I'm having trouble analyzing this. If I assume that they
<br>
believe values can't cause Bayesians to disagree, they should deduce from
<br>
the apparent disagreement that something such as an ambiguous word is
<br>
causing the disagreement, and they should correct it by speaking more
<br>
precisely. But if instead I assume they believe values CAN cause Bayesians
<br>
to disagree, it's unclear whether they have to notice the ambiguity.
