<em>&gt; &gt; You know, I hear that the US troops occupying Iraq
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are driving up to towns, and searching house to
</em><br>
house for hidden weapons. It appears some Iraqis are
<br>
signalling their arrival to others by flickering their
<br>
porch lights.  Hmmm, citizens warning their fellows
<br>
about occupying troops coming to search for guns,
<br>
using lights.... I seem to have heard something
<br>
similar to that before somewhere, maybe from
<br>
elementary school.... help me out here Ron...

<br>
<em>&gt; Doesn't it bother you at all that you would consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Baathist murderers to be analogous to the U.S.'s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original revolutionaries and founders?  Those like
</em><br>
Saddam Hussein ---criminals against humanity of the
<br>
first degree--- need to be hunted down after they lose
<br>
wars!
<br>
<p>Hmmmm.
<br>
<p>You have a point, Lee.  Our culture holds the
<br>
revolutionaries in high esteem, and the comparison
<br>
thus colors the Iraqi-porch-light-flickerers in a
<br>
positive glow of dubious warrant.
<br>
<p>Which leads us to notice--thank you, Lee--the missing
<br>
piece of the puzzle:  what is the truth about the
<br>
porch-light-flickerers?  Are they remnants of the
<br>
Baathist regime, color them criminal, or are they
<br>
Yankee-go-home Iraqis, color them how: troublesome,
<br>
uncooperative, unwise, patriotic?  I don't know.  I
<br>
guess we'll find out.
<br>
<p>Anyway, take Michael's spin off the matter, and what
<br>
have we got?  At best, pockets of resistance, at
<br>
worst, a guerrilla war.
<br>
<p>What we can hope is that the US actors improve the
<br>
situation rapidly enough so that the Iraqis are won
<br>
over and cooperate by turning in or self-enforcing the
<br>
violently intransigent.  I'm not optimistic that the
<br>
Bush crew will achieve so optimal an outcome.
<br>
<p>We shall see.
<br>
<p>By the way, I was conflicted on the war.  There were
<br>
pros and cons.  (When it became apparent that GB2 was
<br>
committed. I hoped for what I called &quot;The One Bomb
<br>
War&quot;: find Saddam, kill Saddam, call it a day.  And,
<br>
to his credit, GB2, gave it a shot.  By the way, where
<br>
is Saddam?) What finally put me in opposition was the
<br>
combination of three factors: the poor US record vis a
<br>
vis nation building, the extreme &quot;degree of
<br>
difficulty&quot; of such an undertaking in Arabistan, and
<br>
the (to me) seeming implausibility of the notion that
<br>
born-on-second-base-thinks-he-scored-a-triple GB2
<br>
would be up to the task.
<br>
<p>OK.  Cheap shot.  I'll eat it without relish if it
<br>
turns out well done.
<br>
<p>We shall see. 
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental
<br>
ills of society. If we're looking for the sources of
<br>
our troubles, we shouldn't test people for drugs, we
<br>
should test them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and
<br>
love of power.&quot; - P. J. O'Rourke
