<p><em>&gt; gts may very well be right.  However, he cannot deny that there are

<em>&gt; some people who can produce a reasonable income (I consider 6 figures 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable for any occupation) solely by buying and selling stock.
</em><br>
<p>The question is whether that person's income exceeded the buy and hold
<br>
market return after adjusting for risk, and if so then whether it can be
<br>
duplicated.
<br>
<p>I don't deny, either, that we can find some people who bet on the outcome of
<br>
a coin flip ten times and won each time.
<br>
<p>In a world of coin-flip bettors that coin-flip bettor will become famous. He
<br>
will write books on the proper way to predict coin-flips. Like Warren Buffet
<br>
and Peter Lynch, he will become a folk hero among hopeful coin-flip betters
<br>
everywhere who want so desperately to believe they have the power to predict
<br>
coin-flips. 
<br>
<p>Here is another way to look at this question: 
<br>
<p>There are a small handful of people in this world, namely Buffet and Lynch,
<br>
whose performance over time was so extraordinary that it is tempting to say
<br>
they really have skill. But the number of people who have this alleged skill
<br>
is so small that it becomes irrational to assume that just anyone can have
<br>
it or obtain it. These gifted people, assuming they really exist, appear to
<br>
belong to a different species of humans.
<br>
<p>In this way the arguments for the existence of market skill are much like
<br>
arguments for the existence of telepathy. There are some tantalizing stories
<br>
that seem to be convincing evidence that telepathy is a real phenomenon.
<br>
However parapsychologists have been unable to prove its existence under
<br>
controlled conditions. An honest parapsychologist can say only that
<br>
telepathy might exist, but if it exists then its existence is so rare that
<br>
it doesn't show up on the radar screen. It would be irrational therefore to
<br>
assume that one is telepathic.
