### There is a lot of competition between blood pressure drugs, so
<br>
even if the pie is huge, the slices can get thin. This is a source of
<br>
uncertainty - if ALT-711 develops as something more than just a blood
<br>
pressure drug in the minds of physicians and patients, the gain could
<br>
be as you say, but otherwise sales could be disappointing.

<p>mez:
<br>
<p>True. There's no way to be sure of sales for the drug, if it ever
<br>
makes it to market.  Many factors, including marketing and the
<br>
appearance of other treatments, will affect revenue figures for
<br>
ALT-711.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>For what it's worth, I base my estimate of potential sales on:
<br>
<p>1) Sales figures for existing single hypertension drugs.  For example,
<br>
Merk's Cozaar is expected to generate $2.3 Billion in sales this year.
<br>
<p>2) The fact that ALT-711 appears to be complementary to existing
<br>
hypertension drugs, rather than a competitor to them.
<br>
<p>3) The absence of other drugs that share ALT-711's mechanism, and thus
<br>
the absence of any direct competitor for it, at least initially.
<br>
<p>4) The large population of people in the US with hypertension that is
<br>
not currently controllable via other drugs (5 million, if I recall
<br>
correctly).
<br>
<p>5) The probable approval of ALT-711 for other indications,
<br>
specifically congestive heart failure in the short term.  (Which I
<br>
should have mentioned in the original post.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Alteon was definitely a better buy a few months ago at $1 / share.  I
<br>
wish I'd bought more then.  Even so, at $5 / share or thereabouts now,
<br>
I believe it remains quite attractive for the risk-tolerant investor.
<br>
That window of attraction is small, though.  By August at the latest
<br>
the single largest unknown about Alteon's future will be resolved, and
<br>
the stock price will reflect it.
