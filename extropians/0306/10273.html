</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, assuming your numbers are right then you would be hating me right
</em><br>
now
<br>
<em>&gt; for my advice.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; However on average the many hundreds of clients I served over the years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have loved me for providing similar advice. In general it is foolish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to sell automatically just because of a drop in price.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on the news.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; More often than not,&gt; it is a good opportunity to buy.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree (and remarked how some people bought and made money off the
<br>
dead cat bounce on CREE).  But as the news was about possible fraud, I would
<br>
not have felt comfortable  holding CREE into Monday.  Even if I bought CREE
<br>
at the lowest of the day on Friday ($15.65), I would have hoped to sell it
<br>
later that day, but in any case would not have held the shares into next
<br>
week.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; For example I was there riding the saddle on &quot;Black Monday&quot;, October 19,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1987, when the market dropped something like 12% in one day. People who
</em><br>
got&gt; stopped out on that day now look like idiots. And the truth is that
<br>
they
<br>
<em>&gt; really were idiots. Anyone who deviates from the buy and hold strategy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; living in a pipe dream.
</em><br>
<p>They were not idiots - they were smart.  There was nothing preventing them
<br>
from re-entering positions later at a lower rate (and they would not have
<br>
been dragging the percentage losses with them).  Example:  If one has a 1000
<br>
shares of stock for $50 with a stop loss at $48, and a stock tanks to $37
<br>
... the stock holder loses *$2,000,* but is then in a much better financial
<br>
position to re-enter the stock at $37 if they so choose (because they would
<br>
not be *$13,000* in the hole if they had held the stock from the $50 range).
<br>
Last year two stocks with which I am very familiar - THC and DKWD - tanked,
<br>
and then tanked some more big time.  I've re-entered and played both of them
<br>
since (when DKWD was under $10, and THC was - as it still is - in the
<br>
teens).  Had I held THC from the $40+/share price, and DKWD from my original
<br>
almost $30/share levels, I would have been a bagholder for the huge
<br>
percentage gains - totaling tens of thousands of dollars.  Instead, I took
<br>
limited losses on both stocks, and have since traded both to the tune of
<br>
many profitable trades at their present levels, so overall am up on both of
<br>
them.
<br>
<p>Stop losses kept me &quot;in the game&quot; to trade another day ...
