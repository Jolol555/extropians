You're neglecting an important second reason for secrecy:  
<br>
protecting one's intellectual properties. Secrecy is not going to
<br>
disappear because this second reason will remain in force.

<p>It's not enough that agents be standardized, their mental architecture has
<br>
to be designed so that biases can be checked while their intellectual
<br>
properties are protected. This seems very difficult to me, if not 
<br>
impossible.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To see that there really is a demand for such self-deception, let's

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I face a tradeoff.  The more confident I become I like her the worse my
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't think this is a good example of self-deception. If your girlfriend
<br>
can infer what your original x was from y, then so can you, and the whole
<br>
thing breaks down.
<br>
<p>It seems to me that self-deception should be thought of as an attempt to
<br>
hide information, rather than to signal it. Here is my example.  Suppose
<br>
there is a job applicant for a software engineering position, who you
<br>
think has a skill level uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. He has an
<br>
incentive to appear to believe that his skill level is 1 no matter what it
<br>
really is.
<br>
<p>Now to illustrate the conflict between checking biases and protecting
<br>
intellectual properties. Suppose while reading the applicant's mind, you
<br>
notice that one reason he believes that he has a very high skill level is
<br>
that he believes he invented some very effective algorithms in the past.  
<br>
Now what kind of mental architecture will allow you to verify that the
<br>
belief is unbiased without also letting you learn what the algorithms 
<br>
actually are?
<br>
<p>Or think about it this way. There has to be certain private vaults within
<br>
your brain that are not open to inspection. They would contain things like
<br>
your ATM password, or the fact that you think company X might be a really
<br>
great investment opportunity. How could the inspector know that you have
<br>
not hidden your real beliefs in these vaults?
