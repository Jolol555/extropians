<em>&gt;&gt;Wouldn't it be cool if something like the 60s USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;happened in Iran? ... That would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;be such a kick. I hope some day they will join
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;us. And the world will live as one. spike
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;It sure would, but you know what typically happens 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;when religion gets tied up in these things. Islamic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hippies, now that _would_ be a sight to see...James....
</em><br>
<p>Does anyone here remember the 60s?  I do a little, and I
<br>
recall that Christianity was big in the hippie movement.
<br>
They called them Jesus freaks.  Buddhism was big too 
<br>
(ex. Kerouac's Dharma Bums, etc.)
<br>
<p>I heard a reference to a show that I really used to 
<br>
like as a child, called Kung Fu.  It seemed so much
<br>
deeper and smarter than the two other stations we used 
<br>
to get (which were carrying HeeHaw Honeys and The Dukes 
<br>
of Hazard.)
<br>
<p>Question please, those who were there: was Kung Fu 
<br>
a really good show, or did it just seem that way
<br>
at the time, to a 10 yr old?  Has anyone seen that
<br>
show recently?  Has it aged well?
