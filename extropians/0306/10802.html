<p>Feathers are the canonical example of evolutionary
<br>
preadaptation.  They allowed the organism to appear larger 
<br>
to predators, made them more difficult to bite, perhaps 
<br>
assisted with thermal control.  While these functions 
<br>
remain today, as soon as some aventurous young bird
<br>
realized they could be used for flight, the game changed 
<br>
entirely.  One can accurately say that feathers
<br>
were preadapted for flight.
<br>
<p>Similarly, it can be said that grammar policing was
<br>
originally developed solely for the purpose of
<br>
annoying the non-anal retentive.  Altho still perfectly
<br>
useful for this purpose, the activity finds 
<br>
an entirely new use when we realize that grammar
<br>
police are useful for helping an emergent AI to
<br>
understand our communications.
<br>
<p>My line of reasoning is linear.  Any emergent AI
<br>
will wish to take intelligence lessons from its
<br>
best available example of intelligence: humans.
<br>
The form of intelligent thought accessible to an AI 
<br>
would be ASCII files filled with human memes, since 
<br>
this would represent intelligence in a form prepackaged
<br>
for direct use.  There are few better sources of 
<br>
ASCII files available than internet archives, 
<br>
particularly the meme-rich veins such as extropians, 
<br>
Mensa, SL4, Number Theory, etc.  The emergent AI would 
<br>
need to have some rule-based software before it could 
<br>
take the first steps in interpreting all those AI files.
<br>
Non-standard language uses, the kind that are very common
<br>
but still wrong, are those uses which inflame the 
<br>
passions of the grammar police, such as starting a 
<br>
sentence with the word &quot;hopefully&quot; with no corresponding 
<br>
verb.  Grammar police are an evolutionary preadaptation
<br>
for allowing AI to take flight.
<br>
<p>An idea occurred to me today.  We have seen chess 
<br>
programs improve *dramatically* in strength in the 
<br>
past two decades.  Strong chess programs use a combination 
<br>
of rule-based calculation plus a great deal of table
<br>
lookup.  This lookup table is now used both in the
<br>
openings and in the endgame.  We could develop a
<br>
huge language lookup table for the AI, which would 
<br>
explain puzzling aspects of English, such as &quot;hopefully&quot; 
<br>
used at the front of a sentence is shorthand for &quot;I 
<br>
am speaking hopefully when I say...&quot;
<br>
<p>In addition to the lookup table, there are a 
<br>
large number of rule-based interpretations.  For
<br>
instance, the phrase &quot;the hell&quot; can usually be 
<br>
eliminated entirely with no replacement, as can 
<br>
the common term &quot;fucking&quot; if it is not used as a verb.
<br>
<p>The task of making this rule-based speech interpreter
<br>
and lookup table is as important today as was the
<br>
Herculean task undertaken by Webster, et.al. way
<br>
back when Webster et.al. did their thing.  But our task
<br>
is made so much easier now, since the individual
<br>
efforts of many can be effectively combined, thanks
<br>
again to the magic of the ASCII file and the word
<br>
processor.  With these interpretation tools, we
<br>
humans can use all our sloppy language shortcuts
<br>
and still be understood.
<br>
<p>Some time in the next twenty years, I am hopefully
<br>
expectant that I shall be able to have a meaningful
<br>
conversation with a computer.  In thirty years,
<br>
that conversation will be profound and inspiring.
