Emlyn proposed:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I don't agree with this. It is true that there's a savage downturn in IT,
<br>
but that doesn't mean there is no work, it just means that we can't charge
<br>
the outrageous fees that we used to.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Emlyn, I don't know about you, but I didn't charge any outrageous fees for my 
<br>
little efforts. You must be mistaking me with some contractor who charges 6 
<br>
figures for protecting the universe from the Y2K crisis. But as I will go on to 
<br>
point out, this is just about me. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Live with it, it's a market economy.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Emyln, nobody can live on what people make in Asia, Africa, or Latin America. 
<br>
Nobody from Europe, Norte America, or Australia and New Zealand. Somebody 
<br>
from Bulgaria may receive comptetive wages, for their work, but they will not be 
<br>
able, on their salary level and rate of exchange to purchase Australian goods 
<br>
amd services. Its not that they don't wish to, its that there is no way they 
<br>
can reasonably afford them, due to rates of exchange and expectations for 
<br>
standard of living. For example, living in Sofia, Bulgaria and taking the bus, and 
<br>
electric trams are acceptable there as New Yorkers of all classes taking the 
<br>
subway or Chicagoans taking the L . But as decently as they will live on these 
<br>
new jobs, they will not be purchasing British Land Rovers, for example. 
<br>
<p><p>&lt;&lt;We all benefitted wildly and disproportionately from the bubble, now we are 
<br>
out
<br>
in the cold for a while. It's a good opportunity to learn something...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>??? Emlyn! What the heck kind of money have you been making ??? Have you been 
<br>
flying around in a Lear Longhorn and eating Russian caviar of the thigh of a 
<br>
Swedish stewardess? You must be doing something correctly.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;economies have cycles, and if the boom you are in seems too good to be 
<br>
true,
<br>
it might be a good idea to try saving.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Lots of people, in IT have been living paycheck to paycheck. The off-shoring 
<br>
of technical jobs is a new feature. Secondly, the industry group ITAA bribed 
<br>
the US Congress into believing this lie &quot;There will be 5,000,000 new jobs added 
<br>
for computer analysts, by 2005. This was and is a big lie first promulgated 
<br>
by the ITAA in 1998. Hence the importing of H-1B's (foreign workers) who work 
<br>
for 1/2 pay for contract companies and L1's (workers who nominally were 
<br>
employed by Fortune 500 shops overseas) have been brought in to compete with 
<br>
Americans. Its going to be nigh impossible to &quot;save&quot; one's way to prosperity, Emlyn 
<br>
when the jobs disappear.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Anyway, what's wrong with skilled Indians having jobs? Who is to say they
<br>
deserve them less (if that matters) than USians?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>The Indians brought over here seem to be very nice, intelligent people. This 
<br>
is a real opportunity to send money back home, which according to one fellow I 
<br>
spoke with, keeps his mom, well taken care of. My issue is not with Joe 
<br>
sixpack from India or Bulgaria. My issue is with the bastards that currently sit on 
<br>
the boards of directors who know how to squeeze money to bullshit the 
<br>
stockholders; but have no interest in growing a company by new products, inventions, 
<br>
or services. Emlyn, without middle class jobs to purchase goods and services, 
<br>
the economy will tank. If the economy tanks, things very un-Extropian.  
<br>
<p>If W's tax cuts do not pump things up ( I suspect they will not as states 
<br>
make up the difference) then I say he will be Mr. 1-term, failing a nuclear blast 
<br>
in NYC. The Democrat that follows him will do the Re-flation dance and we 
<br>
will have a softish prosperity for a few years, till the business cycle closes 
<br>
and the inflation brings another recession. 
<br>
<p>So its not just about me being a greeeedy little duck, its about our standard 
<br>
of living and mutual economic security.
