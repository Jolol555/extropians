<p>
VALID AND INVALID CRITICISMS 
<br>
<p>It is commonly thought that all criticisms in science are equal. 
<br>
This is not so. In fact, criticisms must have two properties to be 
<br>
valid. First, it must be controlled, meaning that the criticism 
<br>
cannot also apply to well-accepted scientific disciplines. In other 
<br>
words, we cannot use a double standard and apply one set of 
<br>
criticisms to fledgling topics and an entirely different set for 
<br>
established disciplines. If we did, nothing new could ever be 
<br>
accepted as legitimate. Second, a criticism must be testable, 
<br>
meaning that a critic has to specify the conditions under which the 
<br>
research could avoid the criticism, otherwise the objection is just 
<br>
a philosophical argument that falls outside the realm of science. 
<br>
<p>A thorough examination of the usual skeptical allegations about 
<br>
laboratory psi research reveals that only one is both controlled and 
<br>
testable: Have independent, successful replications been achieved? 
<br>
We now know that the answer is yes, so the criticisms should stop 
<br>
here. However, skepticism dies hard, and surprisingly few scientists 
<br>
realize that all criticisms are not created equal. So let's
<br>
briefly review why some other common criticisms are invalid. 
<br>
<p>One popular assertion is that &quot;Many phenomena that were once thought 
<br>
to be paranormal have been shown to have normal explanations.&quot; This 
<br>
is invalid because it's uncontrolled – the same criticism can
<br>
be applied to many discoveries in other well-accepted scientific 
<br>
disciplines. If we were forced to reject psi just because we 
<br>
originally thought it was one thing but later we discovered that it 
<br>
was something else, this does not invalidate the existence of the 
<br>
effect, it merely redefines how we think about it. 
<br>
<p>Another criticism is that &quot;Some paranormal effects have been shown 
<br>
to be the outcome of fraud or error,&quot; so we can safely ignore any 
<br>
successful results. This is invalid because if we were forced to 
<br>
dismiss scientific claims because there have been a few cases of 
<br>
experimenter fraud, then we would have to throw out virtually every 
<br>
other realm of science as well because fraud exists in all human 
<br>
endeavors. 
<br>
<p>Another favorite complaint is, &quot;There are no theories of psi.&quot; This 
<br>
is invalid because for the term &quot;psi&quot; we could substitute the 
<br>
words &quot;consciousness,&quot; &quot;gravity,&quot; &quot;anesthesia,&quot; or dozens of other 
<br>
well-accepted concepts or phenomena. The fact that scientists do not 
<br>
understand some phenomena very well has not reduced scientific 
<br>
interest in them. Another charge is that &quot;Psi cannot be switched on 
<br>
and off, and the variables that effect it cannot be controlled.&quot; 
<br>
This is invalid because there are all kinds of effects we have no 
<br>
direct control over, yet this does not disqualify them as legitimate 
<br>
objects of study, including most of the really interesting aspects 
<br>
of human behavior. In any case, psi is somewhat controllable in the 
<br>
sense that we can cause predictable effects to appear by asking 
<br>
people to do something in their mind. If they do not pay attention 
<br>
to the task, which is how control periods are conducted in some psi 
<br>
experiments, then no unusual effects appear. 
<br>
<p>Some skeptics have protested that &quot;It's impossible to distinguish 
<br>
between psi and chance effects even in a successful experiment 
<br>
without the use of statistics.&quot; This criticism is invalid because 
<br>
the same can be said for almost all experiments in biology, 
<br>
psychology, sociology and biomedicine. Obviously, if there were some 
<br>
way of cleanly separating a signal from random noise before the 
<br>
experiment was conducted, then statistics would not have been used 
<br>
in the first place. 
<br>
<p>This litany of common criticisms can go on for many pages, but the 
<br>
point is clear. The vast majority of complaints about psi research 
<br>
are invalid because they equally pertain to conventional, well-
<br>
accepted disciplines, or the complaints are untestable. Another 
<br>
reason that psi has been ignored by mainstream science, and why 
<br>
decades of scientifically sound experiments have been considered 
<br>
controversial, is because the portrayal of these studies in the 
<br>
media and in college textbooks has been heavily distorted. 
<br>
<p>DISTORTIONS 
<br>
<p>Popular media 
<br>
<p>In the July 8, 1996 issue of Newsweek, an article appeared 
<br>
entitled, &quot;Science on the fringe. Is there anything to it? Evidence, 
<br>
please.&quot; Written by reporter Sharon Begley, this article is a good 
<br>
example of how widely disseminated information about psi experiments 
<br>
is sometimes seriously misleading. Begley's story began with the 
<br>
following, 
<br>
<p>Say this about assertions that aliens have been, are or will soon be 
<br>
landing on Earth: at least a scenario like that of [the 
<br>
movie] &quot;Independence Day&quot; would not violate any laws of nature. In 
<br>
contrast, claims in other fringe realms, such as telepathy and 
<br>
psychokinesis, are credible only if you ignore a couple or three 
<br>
centuries of established science.
<br>
<p>This is a commonplace assertion, but it is worth noting that critics 
<br>
never specify which &quot;laws of nature&quot; would be violated by psi, 
<br>
because the assertion is groundless – the laws of nature are not 
<br>
fixed absolutes. They are basically fairly stable ideas that are 
<br>
always subject to expansion and refinement based on evidence from 
<br>
new observations. For example, after the advent of relativity and 
<br>
quantum mechanics, some of our new physical &quot;laws&quot; forced the 
<br>
classical concepts developed in the 17th century to radically 
<br>
expand. Have we magically reached the end of the trail at the turn 
<br>
of the 21st century, and the present &quot;laws&quot; of science can now be 
<br>
permanently chiseled into stone? I don't think so. 
<br>
<p>Begley apparently believes that aliens landing on Earth is more 
<br>
credible than psi. Does this make sense? In the case of aliens, the 
<br>
evidence is based exclusively on eyewitness stories and ambiguous 
<br>
photographs. Some of the stories and photos are engaging, but taking 
<br>
the leap of faith from this form of evidence to the actual presence 
<br>
of extraterrestrial aliens is unwarranted. There are dozens of 
<br>
alternative possibilities, none of which involve either 
<br>
extraterrestrial or Earth-bound aliens. By comparison, the evidence 
<br>
for psi is based upon a century of repeated scientific evidence. The 
<br>
seduction of the status quo is so strong, however, that a skeptical 
<br>
journalist would rather believe stories about little green men over 
<br>
controlled observations in the laboratory. 
<br>
<p>Later in the Newsweek article, the ganzfeld telepathy experiments 
<br>
were described. After a good explanation of the basic procedure, and 
<br>
mentioning that the observed hit rate for Honorton's autoganzfeld 
<br>
studies was about 35% instead of the chance expected 25%, Begley 
<br>
asked, 
<br>
<p>Was it telepathy? Some experiments failed to take into account that 
<br>
people hearing white noise think about water more often than sex (or 
<br>
so they say); if beaches appear more often as a target than a couple 
<br>
in bed, a high hit rate would reflect this tendency, not telepathy. 
<br>
Also, receivers tend to choose the first or last image shown them; 
<br>
unless the experimenter makes sure that the target does not appear 
<br>
in the first or last place more often as decoys do, the hit rate 
<br>
would be misleadingly high.
<br>
<p>While these criticisms are valid because they are testable, a 
<br>
skeptical reader might legitimately wonder, did targets with water 
<br>
content actually appear more often than targets with sexual content? 
<br>
(No.) Did targets actually appear more often in the first or last 
<br>
place? (No.) Were researchers so naïve as to not think of these 
<br>
possibilities? (No.) The implication was that the criticisms had 
<br>
been overlooked, but they weren't. 
<br>
Begley continued, 
<br>
<p>Skeptic Ray Hyman of the University of Oregon found that, in the 
<br>
Edinburgh runs, video targets that were used just once or twice had 
<br>
hit rates of about chance, while those appearing three or more times 
<br>
yielded a &quot;telepathic&quot; 36 percent. How come? A video clip run 
<br>
through a player several times may look different from one never 
<br>
played for the sender; a canny receiver would choose a tape that 
<br>
looked &quot;used&quot; over one that didn't.
<br>
<p>In fact, as we saw in Chapter 6, the ganzfeld system at the 
<br>
University of Edinburgh used two separate video players to address 
<br>
this criticism, and successful effects virtually identical to what 
<br>
Honorton had reported earlier were still observed. Again, the 
<br>
implication of the criticism is that the ganzfeld results are 
<br>
explainable by this potential flaw, and it is not true. Next, Begley 
<br>
repeated another common criticism: 
<br>
<p>Of the 28 studies Honorton analyzed in 1985, nine came from a lab 
<br>
where one time believer Susan Blackmore of the University of the 
<br>
West of England had scrutinized the experiments. The results 
<br>
are &quot;clearly marred,&quot; she says, by &quot;accidental errors&quot; in which the 
<br>
experimenter might have known the target and prompted the receiver 
<br>
to choose it.
<br>
<p>What Begley fails to report is that after Blackmore's 
<br>
allegedly &quot;marred&quot; studies were eliminated from the meta-analysis, 
<br>
the overall hit rate in the remaining studies remained exactly the 
<br>
same as before. In other words, Blackmore's criticism was tested
<br>
and it did not explain away the ganzfeld results. It is also 
<br>
important to note that Blackmore never actually demonstrated that 
<br>
the flaw existed. 
<br>
<p>Begley continued by describing the mind-matter interaction 
<br>
experiments using random number generators conducted Robert
<br>
Jahn's PEAR Lab. Then she added, 
<br>
<p>As for Jahn's results, there are a couple of puzzles. First, one
<br>
of the subjects, rumored to be on Jahn's staff, is responsible for
<br>
half of the successes even though he was in just 15 percent of the 
<br>
trials. Second, some peculiarities in how the machine behaved 
<br>
suggest that the experimenters might have ignored negative data. 
<br>
Jahn says this is virtually impossible. But other labs, using
<br>
Jahn's machine, have not obtained his results.
<br>
<p>As discussed in Chapter 9, analysis of the PEAR Laboratory data 
<br>
clearly showed that no one person's results were wildly different 
<br>
from anyone else's. Nor was any one person responsible for the 
<br>
overall results of the experiment. Again, the criticism was tested 
<br>
and found to be groundless. The comment about &quot;peculiarities&quot; is 
<br>
pure rhetoric, because without mentioning the nature of the alleged 
<br>
problems, it is an untestable criticism. The assertions that other 
<br>
labs have not obtained Jahn's results is a commonly repeated 
<br>
skeptical mantra, but it is also false, as we've seen. Jahn's 
<br>
results are entirely consistent with a larger body of more than 70 
<br>
other investigators, and overall there is no question that 
<br>
replication has been achieved. If anything, Jahn's results are 
<br>
somewhat smaller in magnitude than those reported by others. 
<br>
<p>It is rather easy to pick apart Begley's article, because it is 
<br>
difficult to fairly portray controversial topics in the few 
<br>
paragraphs available in weekly news magazines. Some distortions are 
<br>
to be expected. But one would hope that book-length discussions by 
<br>
academic psychologists would be more thorough and neutral. 
<br>
Unfortunately, this is not always the case. 
<br>
<p>BOOKS BY ACADEMIC PSYCHOLOGISTS 
<br>
<p>In 1985, psychologist Irvin Child, Chairman of the Psychology 
<br>
Department at Yale University, reviewed the Maimonides dream 
<br>
telepathy experiments for American Psychologist, a prominent journal 
<br>
published by the American Psychological Association. Child was 
<br>
especially interested in comparing what actually took place in those 
<br>
experiments with how they were later described by skeptical 
<br>
psychologists. 
<br>
<p>The first book he considered was a 1980 edition of British 
<br>
psychologist Mark Hansel's critical book on psi research. One
<br>
page in Hansel's book was devoted to description of the method
<br>
and results of the dream telepathy experiments. Hansel's strategy
<br>
was to suggest possible flaws that might have accounted for the 
<br>
experimental results, without demonstrating that the flaws actually 
<br>
existed, and then assume that such flaws must have occurred because 
<br>
they were more believable than genuine psi. Child found that 
<br>
Hansel's descriptions of the methods used in the Maimonides
<br>
studies were crafted in such a way as to lead unwitting readers to 
<br>
assume that fraud was a likely explanation, whereas in fact it was 
<br>
extremely unlikely given the controls employed by the researchers. 
<br>
Even other skeptics, such as Ray Hyman, agreed with Child. In a 1984 
<br>
broadcast of the popular science program, Nova, Hyman said, 
<br>
<p>Hansel has a tendency to believe that if any experiment can be shown 
<br>
to be susceptible to fraud, then that immediately means it no longer 
<br>
can be used for evidence for psi. I do sympathize with the 
<br>
parapsychologists who rebut this by saying, well, that can be true 
<br>
of any experiment in the world, because there's always some way
<br>
you can think of how fraud could have gotten into the experiment. 
<br>
You cannot make a perfectly 100 percent fraud-proof experiment. This 
<br>
would apply to all science.
<br>
<p>Child next reviewed a 1981 book by York University psychologist 
<br>
James Alcock. Alcock's basic theme in this and later publications
<br>
is his belief that parapsychologists are driven by religious urges, 
<br>
a secular &quot;search for the soul.&quot; With this theme driving much of his 
<br>
writings, Alcock considered any psi experiments with positive 
<br>
outcomes to be flawed due to religious motivations. One of
<br>
Alcock's main criticisms of the Maimonides experiments was the 
<br>
assertion that they did not include a control group. For example, 
<br>
Alcock wrote that &quot;a control group, for which no sender or no target 
<br>
was used, would appear essential.&quot; Child responded,  Alcock … did 
<br>
not seem to recognize that the design of the Maimonides experiments 
<br>
was based on controls exactly parallel to those used by innumerable 
<br>
psychologists in other research with similar logical structure ….
<br>
<p>The next book was by psychologists Leonard Zusne and Warren H. 
<br>
Jones. Zusne and Jones wrote that the Maimonides researchers 
<br>
discovered that dreamers were not influenced telepathically unless 
<br>
they knew in advance that an attempt would be made to influence 
<br>
them. This led, they wrote, to the receiver's being &quot;primed prior
<br>
to going to sleep&quot; by the experimenters &quot;… preparing the receiver 
<br>
through experiences that were related to the content of the picture 
<br>
to be telepathically transmitted during the night.&quot; Child pointed 
<br>
out that it would be immediately obvious to anyone that such an 
<br>
experiment, if it were actually performed, would be catastrophically 
<br>
flawed. Obviously if you prime someone before they dream with target-
<br>
relevant information, the entire experiment is worthless. But given 
<br>
that the description is so described, readers of Zusne and Jones' 
<br>
book unfamiliar with the actual descriptions of the dream telepathy 
<br>
experiments could reach no other conclusion than the researchers 
<br>
were completely incompetent. Child responded, 
<br>
The simple fact, which anyone can easily verify, is that the account 
<br>
Zusne and Jones gave of the experiment is grossly inaccurate. What 
<br>
Zusne and Jones have done is to describe … some of the stimuli 
<br>
provided to the dreamer the next morning, after his dreams had been 
<br>
recorded and his night's sleep was over.
<br>
<p>As he discovered one flawed description after another, Child finally 
<br>
concluded that the books he reviewed contained &quot;nearly incredible 
<br>
falsification of the facts about the experiments.&quot; But this was just 
<br>
the tip of an iceberg. It turns out that many introductory 
<br>
psychology textbooks have presented similarly flawed descriptions of 
<br>
psi experiments. These books are used in college courses, and for 
<br>
most students all they will ever know about any topic in detail is 
<br>
contained in these texts. If basic textbooks state or imply that psi 
<br>
researchers are stupid or naïve, is it any wonder that future 
<br>
scientists and professors mistakenly assume that the evidence for 
<br>
psi is worthless? 
<br>
<p>INTRODUCTORY PSYCHOLOGY TEXTBOOKS 
<br>
<p>There is no better soporific and sedative than skepticism. – 
<br>
Friedrich Nietzsche In 1991, psychologist Miguel Roig and his 
<br>
colleagues published a detailed analysis of the treatment of 
<br>
parapsychology in introductory psychology textbooks. They surveyed 
<br>
64 textbooks published between 1980 and 1989, then looked for words 
<br>
like &quot;ESP&quot; and &quot;psychic&quot; in the index and scanned through the 
<br>
chapters on research methods, sensation and perception, and states 
<br>
of consciousness. Of the 64 texts surveyed, 43 included some mention 
<br>
of parapsychology. This is interesting in its own right, because it 
<br>
means that fully one third of introductory psychology textbooks did 
<br>
not even mention a topic that all college students find fascinating. 
<br>
<p>A mere 8 of the 43 texts mentioned that since the 1970s 
<br>
parapsychologists have used the term psi as a neutral label for 
<br>
psychic phenomena. Twenty-one books mentioned the ESP card tests 
<br>
conducted by J. B. Rhine and his colleagues in the 1930s to 1960s. A 
<br>
few books incorrectly claimed that ESP card tests are still 
<br>
representative of contemporary research, whereas anyone even 
<br>
casually familiar with recent journal articles and books knows that 
<br>
such tests have hardly been used for decades. The remaining topics 
<br>
covered included discussions of spontaneous psychic experiences, 
<br>
which were uniformly explained away in terms of misunderstood 
<br>
sensory processes, coincidence, and self-deception. Other topics 
<br>
included brief reviews of a few selected experiments and alleged 
<br>
problems of methodology. 
<br>
<p>Most of the texts ended with a wait-and-see stance towards psychic 
<br>
phenomena, with 35 of the 43 books mentioning lack of replication as 
<br>
the most serious problem. The second and third most serious problems 
<br>
were described as poor experimental designs and fraud. Surprisingly, 
<br>
only a few texts mentioned the development of experiments since the 
<br>
1970s. Nine books mentioned RNG experiments, three mentioned the 
<br>
Maimonides dream telepathy studies, and only one mentioned the 
<br>
ganzfeld telepathy studies. Roig and his colleagues concluded their 
<br>
survey as follows: 
<br>
<p>Much of the coverage reflects a lack of familiarity with the field 
<br>
of parapsychology, … there is an unacceptable reliance on
<br>
secondary sources, most of which were written by 
<br>
nonparapsychologists who are critical of the field and who, at least 
<br>
in some cases, have been found to distort and sometimes fail to 
<br>
present promising lines of research. We conclude that most textbooks 
<br>
that cover the topic present an outdated and often grossly 
<br>
misleading view of parapsychology.4
<br>
<p>This is unfortunate but not surprising. College textbooks reflect 
<br>
the status quo, and the status quo has not yet caught up with the 
<br>
latest developments in psi research. but what sustains the status 
<br>
quo? What has driven some academic psychologists to see psi research 
<br>
in such distorted ways? 
<br>
<p>MOTIVATIONS
<br>
<p>Skeptics are fond of claiming that believers in psi are afflicted 
<br>
with some sort of abnormal mental condition that prohibits them from 
<br>
seeing the truth. Skeptical psychologist James Alcock has suggested 
<br>
that one motivation for this &quot;affliction&quot; is that psi researchers 
<br>
are really motivated by hidden desires to justify some form of 
<br>
spiritual belief. This belief, according to Alcock, has biased psi 
<br>
research to such an extent that he believes there must be something 
<br>
wrong with it. 
<br>
<p>But Alcock's belief about hidden spiritual motivations have
<br>
produced an equally strong counter-bias. This is clear in a lengthy 
<br>
background report that Alcock prepared for the NRC Committee 
<br>
mentioned earlier. For 40 pages, Alcock's report rips apart the
<br>
mind-matter interaction studies reported by physicist Helmut Schmidt 
<br>
and Princeton University engineer Robert Jahn, then it concludes 
<br>
that, 
<br>
<p>There is certainly a mystery here, but based on the weaknesses in 
<br>
procedure mentioned above, there seems to be no good reason at this 
<br>
time to conclude that the mystery is paranormal in nature.
<br>
<p>In dismissing the mystery, Alcock missed the forest for the trees. 
<br>
It is true that any one or two experiments can be explained away as 
<br>
being due to chance or poor design, but the entire body of evidence, 
<br>
as discussed in Chapter 9, cannot be dismissed so easily. And in 
<br>
contrast to Alcock's belief about what motivates psi researchers, 
<br>
parapsychology was formally recognized by the mainstream as a 
<br>
legitimate scientific discipline in 1969 when the Parapsychological 
<br>
Association, an international scientific society, was elected an 
<br>
affiliate of the American Association for the Advancement of Science 
<br>
(AAAS). Religious sects, New Age societies, and skeptical advocacy 
<br>
groups are not affiliates of the AAAS. 
<br>
<p>We may now turn the tables on Alcock and ask what motivates skeptics 
<br>
to spend so much time trying to dismiss the results of another 
<br>
scientific discipline. For Alcock, it seems that his feelings 
<br>
towards organized religion and his fears about genuine psi are 
<br>
motivations. For example, Alcock has written, 
<br>
<p>In the name of religion human beings have committed genocide, 
<br>
toppled thrones, built gargantuan shrines, practiced ritual murder, 
<br>
forced others to conform to their way of life, eschewed the 
<br>
pleasures of the flesh, flagellated themselves, or given away all 
<br>
their possessions and become martyrs.
<br>
<p>And, 
<br>
<p>There would, of course, be no privacy, since by extrasensory 
<br>
perception one could see even into people's minds. Dictators
<br>
would no longer have to trust the words of their followers; they 
<br>
could &quot;know&quot; their feelings…. What would happen when two
<br>
adversaries tried to harm the other via PK? Given Alcock's
<br>
feelings about religion and psi, he should be suspicious about the 
<br>
motivations of the prominent physicist, Stephen Hawking. In Hawkings 
<br>
widely-acclaimed book, A Brief History of Time, the final paragraph 
<br>
reads, 
<br>
<p>… if we do discover a complete theory, it should in time be 
<br>
understandable in broad principle by everyone.... Then we shall all, 
<br>
philosophers, scientists, and just ordinary people, be able to take 
<br>
part in the discussion of the question of why it is that we and the 
<br>
universe exist. If we find the answer to that, it would be the 
<br>
ultimate triumph of human reason-for then we would know the mind of 
<br>
God.
<br>
<p>In other writings, Hawkings has declared his skepticism about psi, 
<br>
so apparently his religious feelings do not interfere with his 
<br>
skepticism. On the other end of the spectrum, what would Alcock say 
<br>
about the motivations of his fellow super-skeptic, Martin Gardner, 
<br>
who wrote: 
<br>
<p>As for empirical tests of the power of God to answer prayer, I am 
<br>
among those theists who, in the spirit of Jesus' remark that only 
<br>
the faithless look for signs, consider such tests both futile and 
<br>
blasphemous. …. Let us not tempt God.
<br>
<p>In other words, religious faith can motivate scientists both towards 
<br>
or against psi research. Ultimately, there are as many reasons for 
<br>
why people may be for or against something as there are people. 
<br>
Then, from the skeptical perspective, what else might account for 
<br>
the widespread belief in psi? Is society going crazy? 
<br>
Is society crazy? 
<br>
<p>If there is no scientific evidence that psi exists, then strong 
<br>
public belief in such topics must be a sign of mass delusion. This 
<br>
is a common but rather peculiar skeptical position, as we could draw 
<br>
a parallel with, say, belief in God. There is no scientific evidence 
<br>
that God exists, yet there is strong public belief in God. For some 
<br>
reason, skeptics do not openly point to mental delusion as a reason 
<br>
for the widespread, &quot;unscientific&quot; belief in God. 
<br>
<p>But is there any evidence that society is delusional? Can paranormal 
<br>
experiences be attributed only to known psychological processes? 
<br>
This question was examined by Catholic priest Andrew Greeley, a 
<br>
sociologist at the University of Arizona. Greeley was interested in 
<br>
the results of surveys consistently indicating that the majority of 
<br>
the population believed in ESP. In a 1978 survey asking American 
<br>
adults whether they had ever experienced psychic phenomena such as 
<br>
ESP, 58% said yes; a 1979 survey of college and university 
<br>
professors showed that about two-thirds accepted ESP; a 1982 survey 
<br>
of elite scientists showed that more than 25% believed in ESP; and a 
<br>
1987 survey showed that 67% of American adults reported psychic 
<br>
experiences. The same surveys showed, according to Greeley, that 
<br>
<p>People who've tasted the paranormal, whether they accept it 
<br>
intellectually or not, are anything but religious nuts or 
<br>
psychiatric cases. They are, for the most part, ordinary Americans, 
<br>
somewhat above the norm in education and intelligence and somewhat 
<br>
less than average in religious involvement.
<br>
<p>Because Greeley was surprised about this outcome, he explored it 
<br>
more closely by testing people who had reported profound mystical 
<br>
experiences such as being &quot;bathed in light.&quot; He used the &quot;Affect 
<br>
Balance Scale&quot; of psychological well-being, a standard psychological 
<br>
test used to measure healthy personality. People reporting mystical 
<br>
experiences achieved top scores. Greeley reported that &quot;The 
<br>
University of Chicago psychologist who developed the scale said no 
<br>
other factor has ever been found to correlate so highly&quot; as reports 
<br>
of mystical experience. 
<br>
<p>Greeley then investigated whether prior beliefs in the paranormal or 
<br>
the mystical caused the experiences, or whether the experiences 
<br>
themselves caused the belief. He found that many widows who reported 
<br>
contact by their dead husbands had not previously believed in life 
<br>
after death. This suggests that they were not unconsciously creating 
<br>
hallucinations to confirm their prior beliefs. He also studied 
<br>
whether people who had lost a child or parent reported contact with 
<br>
the dead more often than people whose siblings had died. The 
<br>
assumption was that people who had lost family members closer to 
<br>
them might have had a stronger need to communicate, and hence a 
<br>
greater frequency of reported contacts. 
<br>
<p>According to Greeley, &quot;We were surprised: People who'd lost a
<br>
child or parent were less likely to report contact with the dead 
<br>
than those who'd lost siblings.&quot; Such findings are incompatible
<br>
with the skeptics' hypothesis that reports of paranormal
<br>
experiences are due solely to hallucination, self-delusion, wish-
<br>
fulfillment, or other forms of mental aberrations. 
<br>
<p>SUMMARY 
<br>
<p>Most of the commonly repeated skeptical reactions to psi research 
<br>
are extreme views, driven by the belief that psi is impossible. The 
<br>
effect of repeatedly seeing skeptical dismissals of the research, in 
<br>
college textbooks and in prominent scientific journals, has 
<br>
diminished mainstream academic interest in this topic. However, 
<br>
informed opinions, even among skeptics, shows that virtually all of 
<br>
the past skeptical arguments against psi have dissolved in the face 
<br>
of overwhelming positive evidence, or they are based on incredibly 
<br>
distorted versions of the actual research.
