I have been musing over the whole matrix issue, both the possibility of our 
<br>
world being a Simulation and the Matrix films. I will concentrate this thread 
<br>
on the fictional world.
<br>
Here is some questions and insights that have been thrown up in my mind and I 
<br>
would like to throw them out there to see if someone can add to them.
<br>
<p>In Kids story (Animatrix), it is shown that a persons avatar can die in the 
<br>
matrix and their real body can survive, through will power, belief or faith 
<br>
(depending on your interpretation). This is shown when Kid throws himself from 
<br>
the top of his high school  building and plunges to a certain high speed 
<br>
concrete poisoning death. He is then shown to be alive and presumably on the 
<br>
Nebucanesser with Neo. I believe he is the young lad that runs up to Neo to carry the 
<br>
bags when they dock at Zion in Matrix Reloaded. ( I consider this a nice touch 
<br>
as his character was not explained with enough depth in the film. After 
<br>
seeing the Animatrix, several things that were said about him in Reloaded now make 
<br>
sense. )
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Neo is also killed at the end of the Matrix and yet survives in the real 
<br>
world, albeit after a brief moment of death for the sake of audience suspense.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This would suggest that anyone who is mentally equipped enough to 
<br>
except their avatars virtual death, could survive the event in the real world. Not 
<br>
just 'The One'
<br>
If so, this creates an interesting logic question. What happens to people in 
<br>
the matrix who's avatar is killed without their knowledge? By this we could 
<br>
imagine a person that dies unexpectedly while asleep by a method that is 
<br>
instantaneous, such as a nuclear bomb or any bomb for that matter. Surely if anyone 
<br>
can survive the death of their avatar (as inferred), then these people would 
<br>
instantly awake within their pod in the real world? 
<br>
If the cause of death is the fact that 'the body cannot live without the 
<br>
mind' and 'your mind makes it real' as Morpeous explained loosely in the first 
<br>
film. Then surely a complete lack of knowledge regarding your avatars demise 
<br>
would prevent your mind from 'making it real.'
<br>
Perhaps this could explain how so many people have come to be freed from the 
<br>
matrix and the large populus of Zion. Maybe it could explain how the first 
<br>
escapees arose from 'the world that was pulled over their eyes'.
<br>
