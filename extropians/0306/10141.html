<p>I'm not interested in proving anything.  The strategy of &quot;buy a
<br>
sweetheart, hold it until it goes up 10% and sell it&quot; seems to work
<br>
pretty well.
<br>
<p>Sure, you'll pick the wrong sweethearts once in a while.  But, if you're
<br>
good at picking the next sweetheart ... you can do 25%-35% a year even
<br>
in the past two or three years, where people were whining about being
<br>
7% down in their portfolios.
<br>
<p>Hell, even a conservative person can do 10%-12% a year, which sure beats
<br>
that 3% chump-change they give you at the bank ...
<br>
<p>gts, while I agree with you that there's nothing &quot;scientific&quot; here -- if
<br>
there were, the market would collapse because everyone would know how to
<br>
&quot;win&quot; and nobody would &quot;lose&quot; because they'd just follow the science ...
<br>
and since it's a zero-sum game, this would cause things to pretty much
<br>
come to a stop.  I'm not interested in whether there IS science here ...
<br>
but a usable and useful short term strategy for continuously growing my
<br>
net worth.
<br>
<p>Some day, this strategy might fall apart.  But then, I'm only exposed to
<br>
losing 10% of my worth -- limits are a good thing.
<br>
<p>The most important things to have if you're playing the market is a
<br>
strategy (good or bad, doesn't matter really), and discipline to follow
<br>
the strategy.  It's when you lack either a clear strategy to follow or
<br>
the discipline to follow it ... is when you see people losing their
<br>
shirts.  Part of the strategy is, of course, to &quot;know when to fold 'em.&quot;
