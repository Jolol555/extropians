</em><br>
<em>&gt; computers that could crack existing codes and the development

</em><br>
<p>As Eugen Leitl likes to quip, it's math versus physics and he prefers
<br>
to trust the math.
<br>
<p>Nowadays, transmissions are routinely secured by encryption which
<br>
is mathematical.  To send a message, you send a bunch of data.  It
<br>
can pass through many different networks, over different media,
<br>
etc.  As long as the data eventually arrives, encryption is applicable.
<br>
<p>It's quite possible that practical quantum computers (which we don't
<br>
have and won't have in the immediate future) might greatly reduce
<br>
the effort required to break current encryption schemes.  Which
<br>
doesn't necessarily mean that it will be trivial or even practical.
<br>
Anyway, people don't worry much about this, because it stands to
<br>
reason that by the time practical quantum computers are available,
<br>
there will also be new encryption schemes that take advantage of
<br>
the properties of quantum computing and will be just as unbreakable
<br>
with quantum computers as current schemes are with current hardware.
<br>
<p>What nowadays keeps popping up as &quot;quantum encryption&quot; (e.g. in the
<br>
article you quoted) is something else entirely.  It refers to
<br>
securing a transmission against eavesdropping by making use of
<br>
quantum properties.  In practice, it relies on the ability to
<br>
transmit single photons from sender to recipient.  It _only_ secures
<br>
a physical transmission line by relying on physical properties.
<br>
Since single photons tend to get lost but sending a group would
<br>
negate the whole concept, this is rather tricky to implement.
<br>
<p>To safeguard the message, sender and recipient must be connected
<br>
by a single physical link, e.g. line-of-sight laser or a fiberoptic
<br>
cable.  You cannot forward it from optical to electric and through
<br>
different networks.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it was possible to put quantum encryption affordably on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laptop yet effectively everyone would have it would that be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; net good? 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Quantum encryption&quot; is simply not applicable to this.  If Brett
<br>
and I had such a module in our laptops, we would still need to run
<br>
a fiber line between our homes in Germany and Australia to securely
<br>
talk to each other.  (Actually, the current range limit for laboratory
<br>
stage &quot;quantum encryption&quot; is 100km.)
<br>
<p>Our modern global communications infrastructure is the antithesis
<br>
to this.  Say, I want to send an IP packet from my computer to
<br>
yours.  From computer to switch (ethernet), from switch to dial-up
<br>
router (ethernet), from router to NT (ISN S0 bus), from NT to CO
<br>
(ISDN U interface).  By the time the packet is out of my home it's
<br>
already on its fourth physical link.  Any long distance
<br>
Internet/telephony/etc data exchange will cross dozens of physical
<br>
links.  No problem for encryption, which can be handled end-to-end.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Privacy for all. Or privacy for governments only? Thoughts?
</em><br>
<p>That's worth some thoughts, but &quot;quantum encryption&quot; does not impinge
<br>
on this.
<br>
