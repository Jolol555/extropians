<p>It really is not that simple.  Further, there is a problem with
<br>
(the English) language, such that when one refers to a an object,
<br>
it's not clear whether you mean that object or all objects of that
<br>
class.  If I talk about a book I own, it's unclear whether I mean
<br>
that I own all the information in all books like it (as many say
<br>
the author does), or only the physical instance of the book.  This
<br>
confusion is at the heart of most arguments about both &quot;intellectual
<br>
property&quot; and uploading/copying of people.
