</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be a little like a commune, but one in which nearly

<p>To be honest I don't know Spike -- given some of the flame
<br>
wars I've seen over the last 5 years I don't know if you
<br>
could get 100 extropians to agree on anything.  The question
<br>
would be could they set aside their differences of opinion
<br>
in an effort to decide to try and build something?
<br>
<p>With regard to S.J. Van Sickle's comments -- I agree --
<br>
there may well be better alternatives.  That is part
<br>
of the point of my bringing up the topic.  How does
<br>
one obtain a platform not ruled by national interests
<br>
(and laws)?  And how does one fund such a platform
<br>
in a self-supporting way?  (Given the recent publications
<br>
regarding the depletion of large fish by overfishing
<br>
it isn't clear that trawling from the back end of
<br>
the carrier is going to do the job [of either sustaining
<br>
the occupants or providing income]).
<br>
<p>For those who have never worked or traveled on boats
<br>
they suck up fuel -- probably make any car look cheap
<br>
in terms of miles per gallon.  I suspect it is due to
<br>
increased resistance in water vs. air.
<br>
<p>The best situation would be to find a comfortable location
<br>
(e.g. in the Caribbean) to park the Extro 1, moving it
<br>
only when absolutely necessary.  At least until some
<br>
solar powered engine power source is developed.
