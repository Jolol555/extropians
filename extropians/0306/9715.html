<p>Yes, pleeeeeeeaze install another multiplier of Pentagon and White House
<br>
lies. That is exactly what the world has desperately waited for.
<br>
<p>Meanwhile I am trying to find a new language to communicate
<br>
my extreme disgust at the way some incurable patriots here still stick to
<br>
His Phoniness George &quot;Proud 'n' Pray&quot; W. Bush and his gang of deathists,
<br>
called US government. How many more times must you be fucked up by these
<br>
dilapidated religious fundamentalists before you chase them into the desert?
<br>
<p>I always thought this list was originally dedicated
<br>
to the enhancement of man and not to the sick propaganda of spreading
<br>
potentially apocalyptic violence and mega-effective death all over the world
<br>
and - worst of all - even being PROUD of it and still having the nerve to
<br>
call oneself a transhumanist.
<br>
<p>In the spirit of peace, love and the enhancement of man:
<br>
<p>Turn your back on the brutality of the American interpretation of
<br>
capitalism! Try not to be part of the establishment, because it might twist
<br>
your mind in the wrong direction and deprive you of your compassion
<br>
towards the poor and the weak, and towards those who are not natural
<br>
born collegeboys.
<br>
<p>Don't cooperate with the US military and the criminal current US government
<br>
which is restricting your freedom for a security not even a God can grant
<br>
you. Wake up! There is no such thing as security. It may hit you any time
<br>
and any place. There is nothing you or Ronnie-buddy's fucking Uncle Sugar
<br>
can do about it. You might as well relax and leave the world in peace.
<br>
<p>Take a look for innovative ways to trick the neural patches where the
<br>
antagonists of the human ability to love and be *actively* peaceful rule:
<br>
territorial fighting routines, all shades of xenophobia and this stupid
<br>
natural mechanism of breeding and reproduction which even enhances
<br>
territorial pissings and fear of strange dark-faced Arabs.
<br>
<p>America must not win all the time!
<br>
<p>Relax and Fear Not: The Bush and NeoCon nightmare will hopefully
<br>
be history by 2004.
<br>
<p>For a new kind of transhumanism of social fairness where the poor and the
<br>
losers get a fair chance.
