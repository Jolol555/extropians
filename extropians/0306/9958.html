Samantha said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We, America, insisted on a war.  Many countries tried to tell us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; needed.  Many of our own people tried to do so.  But we were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; railroaded on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the basis of WMD which we really had no good evidence for and which never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materialized.
</em><br>
<p>Saddam, a murderous dictator, INSISTED on remaining a murderous dictator.
<br>
WMD were only part of a greater list of motivations, all the others of which
<br>
you ignore.
<br>
<p>As a person who dislikes governments (at least large ones) I am surprised
<br>
you do not feel more strongly against Saddam.  So I will pose this question,
<br>
which I suspect you will ignore just as others I have asked this of have.
<br>
<p>Does anyone have a right to be a dictator?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If Bush and company had backed down then there would not have been this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; senseless waste of time, energy, goodwill and money for nothing.
</em><br>
<p>And the same could be said of Saddam.  However, Saddams moral goals, that of
<br>
remaining a murderous dictators, are far more repugnant that the Coalitions
<br>
moral goals.  Do you agree?  If Saddam had backed down, there would have
<br>
been no senseless waste of time, energy, money, goodwill, and ~20 million
<br>
Iraqis would have been freed without one drop of Blood being shed.  Yet you
<br>
and others still insist the coalition bears the moral culpability.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nor are we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to extricate ourselves gracefully from the resulting mess for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and at ever more expense in dollars, time, goodwill and lives.
</em><br>
<p>Of course not, when morally bankrupt people insist on never holding a
<br>
murderous dictator morally culpable for being a murderous dictator.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I will grant you that people may have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; died by the actions of their government, somewhat counteracting the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; difference between war and peace (slightly).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *may*?  Whats the figure now, 300,000 in mass graves?  May!?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yeah, im sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ol Saddam would have just stopped his mass killings, oppressive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; exploitation.  What about the deaths from the sanctions, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a result
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the war, have been lifted.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You know as well as I that that WAS NOT THE REASON we went so trying to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whitewash this senselessness afterward with such is highly dishonest.
</em><br>
<p>As I have noted many times, it was one of many reasons, and as I have also
<br>
noted many times, these many reasons were not necessary, as I have argued
<br>
often that the fact he was a murderous dictator morally required our
<br>
intervention.  But whatever the reasons, even if WMD had all ready been
<br>
found, you still would not have supported the war, and you would still blame
<br>
every death on the coalition, instead of the murderous tyrant whos only goal
<br>
was to remain a murderous tyrant.
<br>
<p>As a person who allegedly despises government, I can not see how you dont
<br>
despise the worst type of government on the planet and one of the worst
<br>
governments in existence.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Again, the moral culpability lies on Saddam, not the Coalition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  Saddam and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Baath party could have easily agreed to and facilitied a peaceful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; change in government, and he *chose* not to.  *chose*.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power outages,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no water shortages, no phone problems, no cluster bombs, no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rioting. etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; etc. etc. Saddam is still to blame for each and every death,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; MISS the point that he has NO RIGHT to be a dictator, and thus anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that results from his insisting he remain a dictator he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally culpable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, you cannot put the entire culpability on Saddam.  We were the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invaders.
</em><br>
<p>Again, just as Emlyn, you ignore the Gulf War I, in which Saddam invaded
<br>
another country we agreed to defend.  The resolutions calling for the end of
<br>
the open fighting in the conflict were the ones that were violated and
<br>
instigated res 1441.  Saddam did nothing less than break the agreements that
<br>
ended Gulf War I.  Yet we were the invaders?  Never mind the multiple other
<br>
compelling reasons to oust Saddam.
<br>
<p>Regardless, A stated goal of our actions was to free the Iraqi people, this
<br>
was NOWHERE in Saddams list of goals!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;We
<br>
<em>&gt; are the occupiers.  We did not need to be.
</em><br>
<p>Did Saddam NEED to remain a murderous dictator?  Well, did he?  Did he have
<br>
any moral RIGHT to remain a murderous dictator?
<br>
<p>Some of the power outages and
<br>
<em>&gt; water shortages and so on were not even necessary according to our own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statements
</em><br>
<p>And would have never occured had Saddam stepped down peacefully.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;of what was and was not a legitimate target and our
<br>
<em>&gt; much vaunted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to hit more or less only what we wish to hit.   If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are going to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; continue to be dishones then I will ignore you on this subject
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from this time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forward.
</em><br>
<p>Please exhibit where I am being 'dishonest'  I submit that you are, for
<br>
never once acknowledging that NO ONE has the RIGHT to be a murderous
<br>
DICTATOR!
<br>
<p>I suspect that you will simply ignore my comments, and never bother to
<br>
answer that one simple question under the guise of my being dishonest
<br>
somewhere.
<br>
<p>Does Saddam have the moral right to be a dictator?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; In the US system of law, you are also held morally accountable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for deaths
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that result from 'depraved indifference', which I assert each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and ever war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opposer is guilty of.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK.  You are out of your mind on this one.  I hope you get over it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I am out of my mind?  I have still yet to hear you say that no one has the
<br>
right to be a dictator.  As an extropian, can you not even acknowledge the
<br>
basic moral premise that no one has the right to be a dictator?
