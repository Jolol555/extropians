<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Read the post carefully.  Paul Grant is not supporting Saddam,

<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; nor even defending Saddam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is not only defense, but definitely borders on support.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you realize that this is ad hominem?
</em><br>
<p>That is not correct, in my opinion.  Only if it were already
<br>
true that in a certain community there were no supporters of,
<br>
say, Hitler, would it ad hominem to suggest that someone was
<br>
a defender of Hitler.  But that's what we are (or were) trying
<br>
to establish.  The email post is what we are evaluation to
<br>
determine whether *it* contains defense of Saddam Hussein's
<br>
actions.
<br>
<p>If we do find that the letter contains defenses of those actions,
<br>
then it is a small step---but I grant you a real one that must
<br>
be carefully considered---to say that a certain individual is
<br>
a &quot;supporter&quot; or even a &quot;defender&quot; of a party, movement, or
<br>
individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are no longer discussing the merits of the paper.
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes I was!  If you re-read my post, you will see that I made
<br>
every effort to keep it from being personal.  I used &quot;the writer&quot;
<br>
whenever I could.  When I absolutely had to supply context, I 
<br>
wrote &quot;PG&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are discussing the merits of the person who wrote
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it.  You are no longer questioning the points he made.
</em><br>
<p>No and Yes:  it is an exaggeration to say that I was discussing
<br>
the merits of someone.  It is correct to say that I was trying
<br>
to evaluation the truth of the contention &quot;the writer is a
<br>
defender of Saddam Hussein&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are now questioning the person who made those points.
</em><br>
<p>No---he's not here, and besides, I want only to establish 
<br>
whether or not the post defended Saddam Hussein.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Suppose someone never criticized discrimination, never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; said a harsh word about racists or racism, and invariably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pointed out that members of the KKK and other racists in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; were not worse than many widely respected figures, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that there were many historical precedents.  What would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you think?  What would you say?  Would you say that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was not only defending racists, but supporting them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You can think or say whatever you like, but not here.
</em><br>
<p>I see that you did not answer my three questions here.
<br>
<p>Here's an experiment:  take the letter in question and
<br>
substitute &quot;Adolf Hitler&quot; for &quot;Saddam Hussein&quot;.  Would
<br>
you then say that the post was defending Adolf Hitler?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The rules are clear.  Ad hominem arguments concerning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a person instead of their statements are disallowed.
</em><br>
<p>I could not agree more.  The tough question, as always,
<br>
is figuring out when the line has been crossed.  Would
<br>
someone who considers themselves impartial PLEASE speak
<br>
up to say whether or not they view my analysis to 
<br>
contain ad hominem remarks?  And why?
<br>
<p>*My* post I append to this email.
<br>
<p>Thanks,
<br>

<em>    &gt; &gt; If Saddam had backed down, there would have been no senseless

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &gt; the moral culpability.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; [PG:]
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; I was planning on releasing this to the press Monday morning, but....
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; &quot;President Bush.  It pleases me to inform you that you should abdicate
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; Your thron...OFFICE prior to the end of the week.  If you do so you will
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; Ensure that there is &quot;no senseless waste of time, energy, money,

</em><br>
<em>    &gt; one drop of Blood being shed. If you do not vacate your office
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; immediately, I (and history) will hold you morally culpabable.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This defends Saddam, by saying that he is no worse than other
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;people.  (I will address later the degree to which we should
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;regard this as &quot;support&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; &gt; Saddam invaded another country we agreed to defend...
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; Uh, just in case you didn't know, Kuwait was originally part of Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; Like Sudan was part of Egypt.  In point of fact, Iraq refused to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; recognize Kuwait...
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; So as far as I'm concerned, Saddam didn't invade anybody.  He was
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; putting down a long-standing rebellion when the rebels invited in a
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; foreign power because they were scared of the consequences.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not only defense, but definitely borders on support.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In an aside, the writer demeans those rebelling against Saddam,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by implying that their motives were not the best.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The writer then does, however, go on to say
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; This particular scene With foreign powers and psuedo independent
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; states etc has been played out Repeatedly through history.  I can't
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; technically fault the man for his &quot;invasion&quot;;  Kuwait would have
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; expanded his capabilities.  'course he got his butt spanked by
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; The US, but that's another story.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and a sympathetic reader may be entitled to wonder about how
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;much support there really is here.  But the previous quote
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;can stand, not unfairly, without this IMO.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eliezer continues
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; He is pointing out that neither Saddam nor, for that matter, Bush,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; are exceptional from a realpolitik view of world history.  I 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; do not share that view of world history...
</em><br>
<p><em>    &gt; Paul Grant, though, is simply stepping back and viewing the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; situation as a realpolitik-oriented historian might view it 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; had it occurred a hundred years ago.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems to me that that's not all he was doing.  His orientation
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was clearly to defend Saddam, though not nearly so clear to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;support&quot; Saddam I will admit.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; People in the grip of blind patriotism who will go to any lengths, however 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; irrational, to exalt Bush and vilify Iraq, will exaggerate the genuine 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; difference that exists between the two, even though there is a genuine 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; difference.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very true ;-)  But logically, of course, it does not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;follow that all who exalt Bush and vilify Saddam are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the grip of the blind sort of patriotism!
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; No matter how evil Saddam is, it will always be possible to 
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; paint a picture of him that is even more evil than the reality.
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; A scrupulous arguer must then attempt to dispel this picture,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; and, I suppose, be accused of &quot;defending&quot; Saddam.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That's exactly why lip service *at least* is called for:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps you misunderstood my point about it.  What I 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;meant to say was that if one will take just a moment
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to deliver a recognition of the part of the truth in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;others' arguments, then one may proceed with one's
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own tirade without making the situation much worse.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Of course it may well be that [the writer], in the heat of
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; bipolarized argument, went too far in arguing and tipped
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; the scales the other way.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, rather clearly.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; This should not be interpreted as any particular liking or
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; support for Saddam, which is of course extremely unlikely
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; in terms of prior odds.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But with no denial or criticism in evidence, it is not
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;unreasonable to suppose (or at least suggest) that the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;bitter feelings of so many extreme partisans indeed 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;result in that very thing you consider so unlikely.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suppose someone never criticized discrimination, never
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;said a harsh word about racists or racism, and invariably
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pointed out that members of the KKK and other racists in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;were not worse than many widely respected figures, and
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that there were many historical precedents.  What would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you think?  What would you say?  Would you say that he
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;was not only defending racists, but supporting them?
