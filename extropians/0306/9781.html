</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; quietly and respectfully and still do nothing or very little 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and still get a passing grade because she is nice and she &quot;tried.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>I, who wrote the original paragraph, was the sort of child who modern
<br>
teachers would get hopped up on drugs to get to behave, or to pay
<br>
attention. Here's a little history:
<br>
In fifth grade I spent more days in detention than not. I had C and D
<br>
grades. I was forced to learn at the same dull and snails pace as the
<br>
rest of the idiots and was bored out of my skull. Misbehaved to the
<br>
point of wrestling matches with my teacher. Got corporal punishment
<br>
from the principal (ruler on the wrist).
<br>
Sixth grade I had the best 6th grade teacher who rewarded achievement
<br>
and ran her own self-study projects in class. I did quite well and was
<br>
also part of a new gifted child program that encouraged study projects
<br>
in areas of interest. I designed a space colony.
<br>
Dad and I took a course at the local community college in BASIC
<br>
programming. 7th grade seemed to start off on the same dull footing. I
<br>
was put into average aptitude class groups and was bored out of my
<br>
skull. More detentions. Mum spoke up and I was moved into a math
<br>
self-study group that accelerated me to the point where I took
<br>
pre-algebra during second semester and algebra in 8th grade. I was
<br>
moved into higher aptitude classes in other areas and was also made a
<br>
teaching assistant in a new programming class. I wrote programs for the
<br>
school's only TI-99 PC, a football video game, a roulette game and a
<br>
slot machine game.
<br>
By freshman year of high school, I was taking the same classes as my
<br>
two year older brother.After that, the only discipline problems were
<br>
due to being the top nerd in a rural school.
<br>
<p>The  high school guidance counselors saw my nerdiness as a threat. They
<br>
encouraged my parents to get me to want to be more 'well rounded' by
<br>
claiming that I needed to be that to get into the Air Force Academy,
<br>
since my dream was to become an astronaut. I did band, chorus, played
<br>
team sports, whoopdeedoo. No more accelerated learning programs. I'd
<br>
have to survive on the notches up I'd already gained. I usually read
<br>
the entire textbook of a class within the first month, and stayed
<br>
occupied in class by selling answers to other students. This economic
<br>
activity got me some popularity, far more than 'well rounded'
<br>
activities got me, so I was invited to parties and offered alcohol in
<br>
school. What did it matter? I was bored out of my skull again. By
<br>
middle of junior year I was kicked off the ski team for being drunk at
<br>
a race (didn't matter that I won the race, my best performance of the
<br>
year). I'd abandoned computers entirely.
<br>
<p>Modern schools do not want to encourage nerds to be even better nerds.
<br>
God forbid, a teacher who encouraged it might be responsible for the
<br>
next Bill Gates, and THEN where would we all be??? Paying more money
<br>
for smart kids to get better education is seen as undemocratic, while
<br>
wasting money on low aptitude kids to stay in normal classes is
<br>
pro-democratic. The only way, therefore, to get special attention to
<br>
gifted kids is to accuse them all of being defective and hopping them
<br>
up on drugs and putting them in special ed programs. Meanwhile, parents
<br>
are discouraged from home schooling and denied vouchers they need to be
<br>
able to afford private school educations for their gifted kids.
