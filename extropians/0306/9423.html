Please reference my post:
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0305/8745.html">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/0305/8745.html</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>My point there and here is that some usages are
<br>
inherently incompatible, and when you attempt to mix
<br>
them, you get instability that requires a lot energy
<br>
input to keep within bounds.  For the Libertarian
<br>
Party, the incompatibility came from trying to promote
<br>
and advance free inquiry into the nature and means of
<br>
a true revolution, while simultaneously trying to
<br>
attract as many warm bodies as possible to vote for
<br>
candidates.
<br>
<p>The &quot;salon&quot; model is perhaps the closest to what is
<br>
workable and desirable.  One of the things that one
<br>
expects to happen at a salon is that people will be
<br>
outrageous, sometimes to get attention, sometimes to
<br>
force consideration of an issue that gets shoved under
<br>
the table repeatedly.  Such people can be laughed at,
<br>
ridiculed, humored, whatever.  However, they serve at
<br>
least one useful purpose, regardless of the merits of
<br>
what they present to us: they demonstrate that there
<br>
is in fact an atmosphere of free inquiry.  Without
<br>
that, the salon is just another fashion clique, and
<br>
any credibility is purely incidental.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, some people on this list are typically
<br>
so worried that someone might post something that
<br>
would be &quot;embarrassing&quot; to extropianism that at many,
<br>
many points in the past this has served to either
<br>
stifle real free discussion, or generated a huge
<br>
amount of heat with little light, with various threats
<br>
- overt or implied - to exclude participants due to
<br>
the emotions their positions evoked.  This response
<br>
itself tends to DIScredit any credibility of the list.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<p>The only proper response - assuming that one considers
<br>
the forum to worth preserving - is to demonstrate the
<br>
impotence of such threats by being even more obnoxious
<br>
and outrageous, even if one is disinclined to be so by
<br>
nature.  Then, if that does not result in banishment
<br>
or censorship, we can feel reasonably assured that the
<br>
forum is still free.
<br>
<p>I would suggest, therefore, that everyone attending
<br>
this salon of, for and by the future take it upon
<br>
themselves to make at least one truly outrageous post
<br>
every month or so, just as an ongoing test and proof
<br>
to those who might feel that at least a chilling
<br>
effect was present, and an encouragement to those
<br>
people who have genuinely good ideas but who cringe
<br>
from facing the social embarrassment or ostracism, the
<br>
snide remarks, etc. that always emerge from those who
<br>
haven't anything good to add.
<br>
<p>If the list is supposed to be an advertisement for
<br>
extropianism, with everyone lined up in their suits
<br>
and flowered dresses, scrubbed clean and then
<br>
airbrushed after the fact, then it rather defeats the
<br>
purpose anyway.  No real extropian would want to
<br>
participate in that kind of farce.
<br>
<p>If it's about a forum for ideas, a free-for-all for
<br>
the people who are in the business of trying new
<br>
things and exploring new and radically different
<br>
approaches, which it often is, then forget those
<br>
suits.  Bring wrenches, crowbars and intellectual
<br>
bulldozers.  Dress for the day: flak jackets and
<br>
jeans.
<br>
<p>There should be and are specific discussion groups
<br>
that limit membership and control submissions.  There
<br>
is nothing wrong with that in a group of experts in a
<br>
field who are pursueing narrowly defined interests
<br>
within a precise protocol.  
<br>
<p>Extropy, however, is NOT a narrowly defined interest,
<br>
and by its nature is likely to generate an infinite
<br>
variety of chaotic nodes.  That doesn't mean that a
<br>
lot of posts frankly stink.  It happens, and we should
<br>
point that out.  SO WHAT?  If someone really annoys
<br>
you, don't read him or her, or, if it pleases you,
<br>
jump all over their case, refute everything,
<br>
demonstrate that they are morons, make them eat their
<br>
words, revel in it.  
<br>
<p>Just don't kill the salon because someone says
<br>
something you don't like.  Grow up.
