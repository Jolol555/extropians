<em>&gt; &gt; Harvey Newstrom asked:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;On a personal note:  You probably think I am anti-George
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; because of my frequent liberal-leaning rants.  I am not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that I have ever felt the need to oppose bin-Laden in this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; group.  It never seemed to come up or be disputed among us.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Do you therefore believe I am a bin-Laden supporter?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; For example, if your [you] are indifferent on Bin Laden, or a supporter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or sympathize with his cause, that will make a difference on how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I view your attitude on other matters. Furthermore, anyone who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; was neutral on Osama, or favorable towards his kith and kin,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are people who, by definition, are mine enemy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is that binary thinking again.  There are a lot of shades between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disinterest and neutrality and support!  I am against Osama.  But I don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; see much I can do about it.  Ranting on the Extropians list doesn't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful.
</em><br>
<p>Of course ;-) it is hard to say what *is* or is not useful!
<br>
But one extremely clear consequence of polarization has always
<br>
seemed to me that the partisans on one side see no need to attack
<br>
the other side's main target.  Why should they?  They feel that
<br>
it's already being done (perhaps overdone) by their adversaries.
<br>
(This applies to *any* discussion, I contend, where sides are
<br>
taken---not just to the political ones.)
<br>
<p>One bad thing about not giving lip-service in the denunciation
<br>
of Hitler (or whoever), is that it creates doubt in the minds
<br>
of the other side about where one stands.  Yet sometimes---when
<br>
I do pay such lip service---some will think that I am posturing
<br>
or not being true to form!   (How can we win?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is outrageous and slanderous for you to therefore label me an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy of the state and treat me as such.
</em><br>
<p>I'll let Mitch answer, but we're all in trouble if the likes
<br>
of Harvey Newstrom are enemies of the state!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People on this list have been accused of being communists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-American, traitors, terrorists, enemy combatants, etc.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simply because they don't agree with some aggressive posters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are serious charges, some of which carry the death penalty.
</em><br>
<p>Well, we should inspect the tiny kernel of truth in such charges,
<br>
if any such truth there be.  For example, I had difficulty *while
<br>
the war was on* (a brief time indeed), not thinking of American
<br>
dissenters as treasonous---I even provided definitions of &quot;treason&quot;.
<br>
This, IMO, *should* give rise to sincere questions about patriotism
<br>
and loyalty, and what roles they truly ought to play, according to
<br>
the visions of the various posters.  Thankfully, such discussions
<br>
have taken place, (and I'm even still interested in the topic, though
<br>
perhaps that should warrant a separate thread).
