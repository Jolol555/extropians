<p><em>&gt; And this provides a semi-seque to my ideas about where opportunity may lie 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for Westerners if the outsourcing and race to the bottom dynamics continue: 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immigration reciprocity may provide a place for small time American business 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people to immigration at least temporarily overseas to 3rd world countries 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where their savings would afford them much more ability to operate a business.
</em><br>
<p>The problem for small business in many third world countries is not lack
<br>
of capital - otherwise they would do no better when they come to the
<br>
United States.  The problem is regulation.  Most third world countries
<br>
struggle with a bewildering maze of regulatory restrictions, applied at
<br>
multiple levels.  Hernando de Soto shows in one of his books the enormous
<br>
number of steps necessary to start a business - it was something like
<br>
500 different contacts and approvals that had to be made.  You had to
<br>
talk to the locality, the city, the state, the national government,
<br>
and a variety of special boards and commissions within each grouping.
<br>
Add to this the widespread corruption and demands for bribes and it
<br>
creates an enormous burden for the would-be small businessman.
<br>
<p>As a result, many or most small businesses are &quot;informal&quot;, i.e. illegal,
<br>
and are constantly in danger of being shut down.  They can't get
<br>
too successful or grow too big, or they will draw the attention of
<br>
the authorities.  You end up with a bunch of famly-run shops and services
<br>
which can barely make ends meet.
