<em>&gt; I am somewhat uneasy at applying market logic to issues regarding

</em><br>
<p>### This is incorrect. Only unpredictable dangers will be inadequately
<br>
addressed by the market (but this is the nature of the world - the
<br>
unpredictable by definition defies a specific preventative action, whether
<br>
individual or collectivist). The predictable dangers can be easily addressed
<br>
by civil liability and insurance. The maker of poisonous food who fails to
<br>
inform his customers about the properties of his product may face liability
<br>
for the effects of poison that could not be foreseen and prevented by the
<br>
customer (when the presence and amount of poison exceed the expectations of
<br>
the so called reasonable customer). This knowledge will make him think twice
<br>
before poisoning food beyond the expected range (i.e. he can still put
<br>
hydrogenated oils in his cookies but will try to avoid surreptitiously
<br>
putting cocaine into them, since this would be an unexpected poisoning).
<br>
Also, his liability insurance carrier will demand that the manufacturer
<br>
either informs about poisons, or refrains from using them, again because of
<br>
the *expected* financial costs, not the costs associated with actual death
<br>
of customers.
<br>
<p>The same logic applies to cars. A very unsafe car (but non-obviously so)
<br>
will a source of liability by regular civil liability rules, with absolutely
<br>
no need to introduce statutory limitations on human behavior.
<br>
<p>In general, as in most other circumstances, such as the stock market, and
<br>
banking, the market is much better at predicting the future and reacting to
<br>
the predictions preventatively, than large bureaucracies. They tend to be
<br>
slow, rigid, unresponsive to the needs of customers, and horrendously
<br>
wasteful (because of the virtual absence of economic feedback loops in their
<br>
decision-making).
