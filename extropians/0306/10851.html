<em>&gt;&gt; ...okay, I'm spacing here.  There's a standard retort
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to the fear that genetic enhancement will lead to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; single genotype becoming dominant - much moreso, by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; much higher percentage (at least of those with access
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to this) having more 9s in their 99.999...% similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; DNA, than is presently the norm - with the remaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; holdouts becoming discriminated against for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reason alone.  But I forget what that retort is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; now.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'm not aware of a standard retort here.  If there is one I'd like to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hear it.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I don't know what the standard retort is, but one obvious approach is
<br>
to figure out why evolution has produced diverse genes rather than one
<br>
dominant genotype. Genetic engineering doesn't appear to alter the
<br>
incentives that organisms have to adopt or avoid diverse strategies.
<br>
&nbsp;The literature on why sexual reproduction exists might help. It has
<br>
some obvious costs to the organisms that adopted it. The best explanation
<br>
I've read for what benefits justify those costs is that for organisms
<br>
that reproduce slowly, diversity is an important strategy for avoiding
<br>
disease. Bacteria and viruses evolve fast enough that if they only need
<br>
to target one genotype, they can adapt to its weaknesses well enough to
<br>
make that genotype uncompetitive with a species that has a large number
<br>
of genotypes with different weaknesses.
<br>
&nbsp;Even if disease ceases to be a problem for humans, there are plenty of
<br>
similar ways that diversity can be rewarded. For instance, if most parents
<br>
in 1930 decided to optimize the personalities of their children for
<br>
popular occupations such as farming, and a handful choose to optimize
<br>
for rocket scientists, the rocket scientists kids would have gotten
<br>
even larger salaries than was actually the case because they would be
<br>
in such short supply. And if everyone tried to breed rocket scientists,
<br>
the farmer salaries would rise.
