<p>
Brett raises one of our oldest and most fruitlessly debated topics:
<br>
whether an upload or a cryonics revivee is &quot;the same&quot; person he was
<br>
before.
<br>
<p>I believe the question is meaningless, based in part on questions like
<br>
these:
<br>
<p>Are you &quot;the same&quot; person you were yesterday?  How do you know?  Isn't
<br>
this ultimately just as much a &quot;leap of faith&quot; as believing that you
<br>
are the same person after awakening from an upload or cryonic suspension?
<br>
<p>Or, suppose you are an upload.  Let's leave aside for the moment the
<br>
question of whether you are &quot;the same&quot; person as before, but consider
<br>
your identity going forward.  Suppose you learn that the computer that is
<br>
running you uses a time-sharing architecture like most computers today.
<br>
It occasionally stops your program for a short while, running other
<br>
people's programs.  It rapidly switches among everyone's program, giving
<br>
the illusion that everyone is running at once.  Does this make you doubt
<br>
that you are not &quot;the same&quot; person from moment to moment?
<br>
<p>Suppose the computer were shut down for a longer time, and your program
<br>
then allowed to run again.  Do you have greater doubts that you are
<br>
&quot;the same&quot; person?
<br>
<p>For me, the intuition that there is an objective fact about whether
<br>
you are &quot;the same&quot; in one incarnation as another does not work well
<br>
given these kinds of gray areas.  If &quot;sameness&quot; is really well defined,
<br>
either you should be &quot;the same&quot; or not &quot;the same&quot;.  It doesn't work well
<br>
to say that there are gray areas.  It seems to be a binary relation, if
<br>
you hold to this philosophical perspective.
<br>
<p>Yet the examples above, which can be further subdivided and permuted
<br>
ad infinitum, demonstrate many kinds of gray areas based on advanced
<br>
technology that can manipulate the substrates that embody our brains.
<br>
Ultimately it does not work (for me at least) to imagine that there
<br>
is a fact of the matter about whether two incarnations of a mind are
<br>
&quot;the same&quot;.
<br>
