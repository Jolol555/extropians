<em>&gt; In a message dated 6/2/2003 8:44:26 AM Central Standard Time,

<em>&gt; <a href="mailto:steve365@btinternet.com?Subject=Re:%20neocons%20(WAS%20IRAQ:%20Weapons%20of%20Mass%20Delusion">steve365@btinternet.com</a> writes: Ron, you keep on saying this. I can only
</em><br>
say you clearly
<br>
<em>&gt; haven't read any political journalism until recently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Steve,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        And maybe one day you will listen.  I hear enough conservative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation to know that Neo Con is not a term used very often in
</em><br>
conservative
<br>
<em>&gt; circles.
</em><br>
<p>Two points in response to that. Firstly it *is* used in certain conservative
<br>
circles, specifically among those conservatives who disapprove of the
<br>
general thrust of the neoconservatives' arguments (the self-styled
<br>
paleocons). I can clearly recall the last outbreak of internecine arguments
<br>
among American conservatives in the late 1980s where these two terms were
<br>
used by both sides. Secondly and more to the point, the term is used (or was
<br>
until *very* recently) by the very people it's used as a label for   eg the
<br>
Kristols, and the contributors to the various books I cited.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Most times it seems to be a clue that the speaker is from the
<br>
<em>&gt; non-conservative side.
</em><br>
<p>Not neccesarily (see what I write above). It does mean nowadays that the
<br>
writer may belong to one of the other varieties of 'conservatism' such as
<br>
the paleos. The neoconservatives themselves are using it less than was the
<br>
case five or six years ago, partly because they have been so successful in
<br>
the internal argument among conservatives that their views are coming to be
<br>
seen as the conservative mainstream, so making a specific label redundant.
<br>
(That's what makes the paleos livid of course)
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;        I haven't read much Leo Strauss, so far, but it sounds like his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; critics take his actual ideas and stand them on their head.  However I
</em><br>
have often
<br>
<em>&gt; been made to wonder how many people have actually read him.  Only Alfred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Korzyski writes a denser style.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ron h.
</em><br>
<p>You and me both! I find Strauss *very* hard going and I think Straussianism
<br>
is one of those strange cults academics are prone to. There's actually two
<br>
varieties (East Coast and West Coast - a bit like rap) but it's very
<br>
difficult for an outsider to distinguish between them. I don't think there
<br>
is any substantial connection between Strauss and his followers and
<br>
neo-conservatism, there's some overlap of personnel but nothing else. Steve
