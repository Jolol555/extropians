<p>I agree with both Lee and Greg and have tried, at least much of
<br>
the time, to follow similar rules.  The exceptions perhaps being
<br>
when I enter &quot;rant mode&quot; and I try to provide notification for that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A personal note.  Someone recently asked for a statement by people

</em><br>
<p>I'll generally agree with Greg.  I am not a pro-war person -- having
<br>
nearly been a draft resistor during the Vietnam war.  I also do
<br>
not believe much of the justification for the war given by the
<br>
current U.S. administration (pointing to an intelligence system
<br>
manipulation or outright failure -- but after 911 its obvious
<br>
there are possible problems there).  But I *do* believe, in
<br>
retrospect, that the war was/is probably very extropic.
<br>
I believe that Tom Friedman (NY Times) and Hillary Clinton have
<br>
both provided good reasons for that perspective, either in columns
<br>
or recent interviews (esp. with Charlie Rose).
<br>
<p>The problem isn't whether Saddam was a dictator.  Dictators
<br>
can manage a population quite effectively (and extropically)
<br>
[the movie &quot;Anna and The King&quot; suggests how this may be true
<br>
{ and at times be problematic }.]
<br>
<p>The *problem*, pointed out perhaps more in retrospect, was
<br>
that Saddam was a &quot;tyrant&quot;.  So dealing with Saddam was
<br>
justified on entirely on a moral (and extropic) basis.
<br>
[I'm using a utilitarian analysis perspective here in
<br>
terms of lives preserved, which I know has gotten me
<br>
into trouble before, but this time I think it may be
<br>
correct.]  Now, whether the utilitarian analysis plays
<br>
out successfully depends a lot on whether one can get
<br>
at least 4 &quot;tribes&quot; of people who do not generally
<br>
get along with each other to get along.  It will be
<br>
interesting to see if that is a problem that can be
<br>
resolved successfully.
<br>
<p>I will freely admit that the U.S. (and the UN) have significant
<br>
problems coming up with solutions to deal with &quot;tyrants&quot;.
<br>
Progress for &quot;humanity&quot; (from an extropic perspective) requires
<br>
that that need should be dealt with.
<br>
