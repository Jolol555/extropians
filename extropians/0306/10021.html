<br>
with each other.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Depends what you mean by &quot;natural law.&quot;  If by natural law you mean moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; laws legislated by &quot;nature&quot; (which may as well be &quot;God&quot;), obviously there
</em><br>
is
<br>
<em>&gt; no such thing.  However, as Greg suggests, humans have a nature (a &quot;human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature&quot;) that influences how we interract.  Yes of course, to a certain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extent we have free will.  But even our &quot;free will&quot; choices are determined
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entirely by our phenotype and environment.  Given this shared &quot;human
</em><br>
nature&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt; there are certain &quot;laws&quot; that &quot;naturally&quot; follow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For instance, as Greg also suggests, our moral laws derive indirectly from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; game theory.  They reinforce our cooperation instincts and counter our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheating instincts.  Human societies universally have laws against, say,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stealing because it is human nature to maximize ones own success, even if
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; means minimizing the success of another human.  The nature of the honey
</em><br>
bee,
<br>
<em>&gt; on the other hand, is to maximize the fitness of the group and the queen,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even at the expense of the individual drone.  So there's no need for a
</em><br>
honey
<br>
<em>&gt; bee &quot;law&quot; against stealing nectar.  It is not in the honey bee's nature to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, to that extent, I firmly believe in &quot;natural law.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
If such laws fall from our human nature then yes they are provisionally
<br>
interesting, so long as we have a human nature. Of course in most other fora
<br>
the appeal to human nature is bedrock although presumably not here.
<br>
<p>However, what is interesting is that Greg said something a little different.
<br>
Greg wrote:
<br>
<p>&quot;In a limited sense, I do.  (As usual) without the time to be complete in
<br>
explaining myself, I think that some elements of social interactions are
<br>
universal and derive from the very nature of (thus, &quot;natural&quot;)
<br>
intentional beings interacting with each other.  Almost all of what I
<br>
would call &quot;natural law&quot; I ascribe to the logic discernable in game
<br>
theory, especially the prisoners' dilemma, most especially the iterated
<br>
prisoners' dilemma.  Beyond this (perhaps more correctly, &quot;beneath&quot;
<br>
this, in the sense of more fundamentally), I think there may well be
<br>
some moral content in the very nature of knowing and intending beings,
<br>
although I'm not as sure about that as I am about the social rules
<br>
derivable from game theory.&quot;
<br>
<p>If I understand him the laws here do not follow from something contingent
<br>
like human nature but are constitutive of the very nature of intending and
<br>
knowing beings qua intending and knowing beings. This raises interesting
<br>
epistemological questions like how we could know this about all knowing
<br>
beings: does Greg have some transcendental argument to prove this up his
<br>
sleeve? And don't transcendental arguments sin against (methodological)
<br>
naturalism? If it is an inductive claim about every knowing creature isn't
<br>
our sample size seems a tad small? How many different knowing and intending
<br>
types of beings do we know? Finally, if we somehow know that such laws are
<br>
necessarily connected with knowing and intending then this raises Kantian
<br>
question of where knowing and intending themselves fit in the cognitive
<br>
hierarchy. Somewhere in our phylogeny presumably we evolved from mere
<br>
proto-knowers to full-blown knowers. Will we become hyper-knowers (with
<br>
perhaps a hyperlanguage) in the future and then be able to outgrow these
<br>
laws?
