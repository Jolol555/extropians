(Please pardon the poor formatting in my mails this afternoon.  I'm

using a not-so-great web client at the moment.)

The real question is, would their task have been significantly harder

without the facilities in Afghanistan?  I doubt it.

John Clark replied:
<br>
Do you? I don't. Even if you're a crazy fundamentalist you are not
<br>
going to crash an airliner into a skyscraper just because I say so
<br>
unless you are convinced my plan will work and am some sort of a
<br>
superior human being who should be followed. To do that I need to
<br>
isolate you from the rest of the world and indoctrinate you, and to do
<br>
that I need at least one secure base, and to do that I need state
<br>
support. They didn't go to Afghanistan to get a tan I can tell you
<br>
that.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;

<br>
<p>mez:
<br>
<p>Aum Sriyinko executed attacks intended to be on the same scale as 9/11
<br>
or even larger.  They had no state support. They operated inside of
<br>
Japan.  Only the fact that chemical weapons are actually rather hard
<br>
to use saved thousands or perhaps tens of thousands of lives.
<br>
<p>Other terrorists and groups both small and large do just fine without
<br>
a state sponsor.  Consider Timothy McVeigh, the IRA, various Basque
<br>
separatist groups, and others.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>John Clark:
<br>
making nice to Islam will not reduce their anger one iota because the
<br>
root cause of that anger was not any specific action committed by the
<br>
west. They are angry at us for what we are not what we did. They would
<br>
be less angry if the foundation of the west was some dogma, even some
<br>
dogma they didn't like,
<br>
instead it is based on free markets and pragmatic problem solving and
<br>
that frightens and angers them. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
mez:
<br>
I disagree.  If you offer just about anyone in the middle east a
<br>
one-way ticket to the US, they'll snap it up.  Everyone knows life
<br>
here is better.  The want that better life for themselves.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Their anger comes from their poverty (relative to us), their despair
<br>
(lack of future opportunities), the oppression of their governments
<br>
(supported or installed by the US), their feeling of having been
<br>
humiliated by the west, and their indoctrination into fundamentalist
<br>
religion.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
A real plan on terrorism would target these root causes by spreading
<br>
affluence, freedom, and opportunity.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
John Clark:
<br>
Sure all that anger is dangerous and needs to be defused, I'm not sure
<br>
what will work but I am sure what won't work, starting a be kind to
<br>
terrorists policy will not work.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
mez:
<br>
By all means go after terrorists.  They should be caught and their
<br>
threat should be removed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
What I'm concerned about are not the terrorists who exist today.  It's
<br>
the /future terrorists/ that concern me.  The future terrorists will
<br>
have weapons that can do far more damage than any terrorist attack
<br>
we've yet seen.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I support actions to protect us against the terrorists of today.  I
<br>
just think it's even more important to forestall the creation of a
<br>
future generation of terrorists.  Where those two priorities conflict
<br>
I place a priority on the future.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I'd rather have another 10 September 11ths than just one nuclear
<br>
terrorist attack, or one bioweapon attack using the biotech of 2030.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So for me it all comes back to spreading democracy and affluence.
<br>
IMHO, that should be the US's #1 priority in foreign policy.
<br>
Hopefully it will work in Iraq and Afghanistan.  But so far I'm not
<br>
convinced.
