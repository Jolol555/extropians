<p>
Guys, Girls, and Friendly AIs;
<br>
The recent reaction to info about Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is 
<br>
the latest episode in highlighting an odd situation from my point of view.
<br>
Let me explain.
<br>
You people comprise, in my opinion, _the_ place to go for 
<br>
up-to-the-minute, cutting-edge, frontier-of-science, tech, and 
<br>
information. I mean, if I met some unfortunate alien who _really_ 
<br>
crashed at Roswell and lost a load of nanotech, I would direct him to 
<br>
you people for help and advice. You could handle that.
<br>
Yet I find you taken aback by such concepts as TMS, selective 
<br>
memory-wiping, and prediction of prejudice by neural scan. People jump 
<br>
about saying, 'ooh, F****** amazing!', 'Wow! F****** Fantastic!'  I have 
<br>
to ask, I really do:
<br>
_Where have you guys been?_
<br>
...We've been using TMS since 1987, we've been using TMS with direct 
<br>
biofeedback control since May last year, we've got computer/human  
<br>
cursor control with mind only and are playing games with it at this 
<br>
stage, we've been able to do selective memory wiping for at least a year 
<br>
now...am I really this underground or am I missing something here?
<br>
...If anyone wants the details of how to build their own TMS unit for 
<br>
about $200, email me privately and I'll send the spec. (I don't want the 
<br>
$200; that's what it will cost you for parts). If anybody wants to know 
<br>
where we've got _now_, email me privately and ask.
<br>
Dear me, it's like living in the 21st century!
<br>
Ramonsky
<br>
<p>PS _Don't_ try TCES; it really hurts.
<br>
<p><p><p>PPS (Hello DB  :  )      ...what would be _really_ funny is if nobody 
<br>
read this either. Only 3 responses last time)...
