<em>&gt; &gt; Brett, what is disturbing to me is my sense of how few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bench researchers have interest in Transhumanism or cryo,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or uploading. Maybe its too new a concept for them. Or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maybe we are all deluded and everything is hopeless, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maybe there are other answers. 
</em><br>
<p>First I think transhumanism and posthumanism have a
<br>
surface tension about them that say humanism did not. 
<br>
It takes a bit of a commitment to punch through the 
<br>
superficial oddball nature and naming of some of those
<br>
groups to get at the essentially sensible propositions that
<br>
lie behind the names. Propositions such as that homo-
<br>
sapiens are not the end point of evolution but are works
<br>
in progress collectively and individually are not that hard
<br>
or too radical, imo for most people with a scientific 
<br>
background to agree with. Nor is it hard to conclude that
<br>
technology sensibly applied can improve the human 
<br>
condition. But what is perhaps harder is to get newbies
<br>
to take the time to look beyond the  labels that don't 
<br>
immediately resonate.
<br>
<p>Second if a newbie puts a toe in the water to see what
<br>
trans-humanists are talking about and they happen to
<br>
investigate the wrong list on the wrong day they are likely
<br>
to find that much of what is discussed is pretty much the
<br>
sort of stuff they could find discussed anywhere. And they
<br>
may also ask themselves if they would want their peers to
<br>
do a google on them and find what sort of circles and 
<br>
conversations they are involved in. 
<br>
<p>Third I encourage folks to remember that there are some
<br>
commercial ideas that cannot be posted to an open list
<br>
without harming their chances of being realised. There
<br>
really is more going on beneath the covers than probably
<br>
most realist and I would not be surprised if many trans-
<br>
humanists have double lives including plenty of non-card
<br>
carrying mainstream scientists and &quot;movers and shakers&quot;
<br>
that are interested in getting things done. 
<br>
<p>But more specifically your question seems to go to why
<br>
aren't the bench scientists rallying to the flags that seem
<br>
so sensible to those that have already climbed on board.
<br>
I think the answer to this is not all that mysterious. First
<br>
some of the bench scientists *are* coming around in their
<br>
personal capacities but they are weary of being judged 
<br>
by who they hang out with in their professional capacity.
<br>
They worry about the &quot;baggage factor&quot;. 
<br>
<p>This applies even more so for commercial companies
<br>
like stem cell companies for instance.  Most of the stem
<br>
cell CEO's I know are former bench scientists that were
<br>
bright enough to have gone out and acquired business and 
<br>
financial management skills. But in the last few years they
<br>
have all undergone something of a ordeal by fire in the 
<br>
need to acquire political skills as well. If day in and day 
<br>
out the media is hounding you for controversial political 
<br>
copy about subjects such as embryonic stem cell research
<br>
and you are trying to keep investors in line and your 
<br>
company focused on achieving political milestones you
<br>
simply don't have the time to take on more controversy
<br>
that you absolutely have to. Human nature being what it is
<br>
I have seen one particular stem cell CEO seek to 
<br>
differentiate the credible mainstream nature of stem cell 
<br>
science by contrasting what his company was doing with
<br>
the blatantly unethical practices of the Raelians. But before
<br>
the Raelians were on the scene his diversion of choice were
<br>
the cryonicists. I am pretty sure this particular scientist/CEO
<br>
has no deep understanding of cryonics (nor I hasten to add
<br>
do I) but by invoking the concept of cryonics and Raelians
<br>
in his public speeches he sought to differentiate legitimate 
<br>
science (what he was doing) from the real oddball science
<br>
as he hope the media would see it.  People under political
<br>
pressure and pressure from investors to deliver against 
<br>
milestones often find it appealing to offer the press alternative
<br>
targets.
<br>
<p>The trade off is essentially possible long term gain for short
<br>
term relief. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When I first climbed aboard the Extropian list, I was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hoping to see some scientists promoting Transhumanism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some cosmologists or astronomers writing about new,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wondrous, essays; such as Moravec or Tipler. Basically,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it ain't happening and I am not sure why this is?  But we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seem to have a dearth of interested theorists. Harvey 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Newstrom had a similar question about this last week. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I dunno.  :-(
</em><br>
<p>I don't quite agree with this. I think the pop science writers
<br>
like Broderick and others have done almost as much good as
<br>
the bench scientists as you call them in getting the sorts of 
<br>
memes that are contained in most transhumanist circles 
<br>
discussed in the public domain.  
<br>
<p>I think there is a tendency for those who understand science 
<br>
a little better than average to overestimate the extent to which
<br>
&quot;truth&quot; as it is understood in scientific circles matters in the 
<br>
courts of public opinion. ie. &quot;Truth&quot; is an irrelevance when one
<br>
is sick or ones relatives are sick. 
<br>
<p>Joe and Jane public and Jill and Jack congressman are not
<br>
typically scientists. The skills that get Jill and Jack into congress
<br>
are not typically the ones that they acquired at the lab benches.
<br>
<p>Jill and Jack congressmen can't take lead public opinion and 
<br>
make better public policy relating to biotechnology unless they
<br>
understand it, and for the most part they don't. For the most
<br>
part politicians come from the ranks of lawyers, or teachers 
<br>
or union representatives. Their people skills are good but 
<br>
their science is generally pretty lousy.
<br>
<p>Getting even a few science savvy exceptions into the congress
<br>
can make a different. Lord Robert Winston of the English house
<br>
of Lords is a science and biology populariser almost of 
<br>
Saganesque proportions in the UK. And his opinions were 
<br>
respected and sought out by his colleagues. This helped get the
<br>
UK one of the most liberal stem cell research regimes in the
<br>
world. 
<br>
<p>But when Jill and Jack congressman don't have enough science
<br>
to lead public opinion quite naturally that take notice of the 
<br>
opinions of Joe and Jane public. After all if they don't know the
<br>
right answer they may as well do the popular thing. So Joe and
<br>
Jane public whether they know it or not end up influencing the
<br>
sorts of policy that is set at national level on biotechnology.
<br>
<p>Now Joe and Jane public have others things on their minds in
<br>
their busy lives than &quot;how many angles can dance in a sim&quot; they
<br>
care about their aged parents with Alzheimer's and their son
<br>
with diabetes and quietly at times though they don't talk about
<br>
it much they miss their dead parents and worry about the health
<br>
of their friends. They will take faith in religion is their is nothing
<br>
else to ease their pain but they will quickly re-organise their
<br>
religious beliefs to integrate real technological advances that can
<br>
improve the human condition of themselves and their loves ones
<br>
if they can find it. 
<br>
<p>Problem is they are busy and those who are pursuing truth don't
<br>
seem to think it is worth taking the time to break down and
<br>
simplify the truths so that they can see how what is going on 
<br>
with stem cells and gene therapy is not something remote and
<br>
far away it is something that has the real potential to effect the
<br>
lives of them and those they care about.
<br>
<p>The meme war is a war for the hearts and minds of Joe and
<br>
Jane average. Get Joe and Jane averages attention and the
<br>
media will stop lampooning and the politicians will follow the
<br>
votes.  
<br>
<p>What's needed I suspect is an architecture or an infrastructure
<br>
for prioritising extropic projects. There are many extropes
<br>
and transhumanists that would gladly contribute time within 
<br>
an architecture of general societal improvement if they were
<br>
convinced that one could be constructed and one does not
<br>
have to be a 2003 polymath equivalent of a Leonardo Da
<br>
Vinci to make a real contribution. But the architecture is 
<br>
important to make people look out a little further than they 
<br>
currently do. To make things less of a zero sum game. The 
<br>
architecture I suspect needs to take into account patents,
<br>
and politics, and international law. 
<br>
<p>I take as a basic premise that most transhumanist are more
<br>
concerned about their own survival than about the survival 
<br>
of strangers. This throws up a problem. Transhumanists
<br>
fall into a number of different ages categories. It could be
<br>
that for the average 60 year old or greater the most sensible
<br>
effort for them would be a massive scientific push to try and
<br>
make cryonics work (as well as possible) and to be as socially
<br>
acceptable as possible. If one is 30, perhaps the priority is 
<br>
in winning funding and research into stem cells and nanotech
<br>
because that might avoid the cryonics thing all together. 
<br>
If one is in ones 20's or younger one may be able to spend
<br>
ones life on the beach or in complete indifference knowing that
<br>
motivated others are going to be working their buts of trying
<br>
to find solutions that will then be available to you. 
<br>
<p>Problem is it seems that the interests of the different age 
<br>
cohorts do not align.  The best way to make them align might
<br>
be to produce an architecture where the resources of the
<br>
many are directed in optimal average fashion but not optimal
<br>
personal fashion to the desired outcome. But that is a heck
<br>
of an architecture to come up with. 
<br>
<p>Sorry for the rant I've digressed considerably from your
<br>
question.
