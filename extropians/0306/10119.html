</em><br>
<em>&gt; lies, pure and simple.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, wow.  Before addressing the issues that Jeff brings up, I would like to
<br>
ask list members two quesitons.
<br>
<p>1st, Jeff elaborates on what he feels is the correct interpreation of the
<br>
Vietnamese government.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The truth? Three million deaths caused by the French,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Americans, and their respective puppets.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;enslavement&quot; by the communists, just a different form
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of government facing the difficult task of rebuilding
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a country savaged by 124 years of foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictatorships, and made all the more difficult by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition of the political elite of the world's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; richest and most powerful country.  An elite filled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with hostility by their defeat at the hands of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people with the brains, discipline, and courage to pay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the enormous price required to &quot;refuse&quot; the tyranny of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign dictators.
</em><br>
<p>AND
<br>
<p><em>&gt; All governments have laws for the maintenance of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social order.  Freedom of speech has its limitations.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I may not cry &quot;fire!&quot; in a crowded theater, nor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; advocate the violent overthrow of the US government.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Communists (and their subsequent governments), under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; siege by the capitalists from before the ink was dry
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, feel the need to protect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves from foreign subversion--
</em><br>
<p>Does anyone else on the list feel that the current communist vietnamese
<br>
government is a legitamate one?  Note I will not be attacking those who
<br>
express this opinion, I am just curious how prevealent this opinion is on
<br>
this list.  Samantha, do YOU feel the current communist government of
<br>
Vietnam is a legitimate one?  Does anyone on this list (besides Jeff) feel
<br>
as much?
<br>
<p>Secondly, Jeff makes various assertions about my debating abilities,
<br>
including claiming that many of my 'facts' are inventions of my idealogy, I
<br>
am dishonest and insulting, incoherent, I am not qualified to discuss
<br>
political topics, undisciplined, lack effort,
<br>
responsibility, and skill.  In addition, I have no capacity or inclination
<br>
to distinguish fact from fantasy, and no logical coherence, and that Jeff
<br>
will refrain from responding to me until I get better at 'thinking about
<br>
such matters'
<br>
<p>With that I mind, I submit humbly to the list the question, do others feel
<br>
this is an accurate description of my presence on the list.  I would
<br>
primarily be interested in hearing from people who generally do not involve
<br>
themselves in debate with me, on either side, primarily people who are
<br>
impartial observers to the discussions I partake in.  If a significant
<br>
number of impartial list members feel this to be an accurate description of
<br>
me, then I will take note and make an effort to correct my debating
<br>
failings.
<br>
<p>However, if Jeff is the primary voice asserting this, I will assume that I
<br>
am reasonably able to argue my case, present facts justifying my positions,
<br>
and generally act in a logical and coherent manner.  And furthermore, I will
<br>
assume Jeff's comments to be more a reflection on the fact the he is in
<br>
ideaological opposition to me, and not an accurate description of reality.
<br>
I will, however, attempt to add more quality to my postings.
<br>
<p>Please feel free to contact me offlist, however, at the risk of wasting
<br>
bandwidth on the mailing list, I would suggest it might be preferrably to
<br>
make an on list note, since no one will be required to take my word for the
<br>
results.
<br>
<p>In fact, in the spirit of Lee Corbins 'working toward a pledge' thread,
<br>
perhaps a collective effort at such a rating would be worthwhile.  I would
<br>
submit voluntarily to hearing constructive criticisms of my debating style,
<br>
online presence, and general public perception.  Perhaps those more
<br>
programming and web savvy than I might put together a poll or list, in which
<br>
each extropy mailing list member may submit one vote and rate the behavior
<br>
of another member, perhaps using the pledge virtues Lee suggests as
<br>
guidelines.  This would in no way reflect on the status of the members
<br>
presence on the board (eh, mailing list), but instead be used as a mechanism
<br>
to improve oneself and oneself's debating ability and, more importantly,
<br>
directed effort to uncover the 'truth'
<br>
<p>To Jeff, upon the results of my query I offer to respond to you, point by
<br>
point, and I will attempt to be as logical and civilized as possible, to
<br>
warrant your respect as an intellectual honest human being.  Perhaps you
<br>
feel I am misinformed (as I may of you) but I hope you do not feel I that I
<br>
intentionally supress facts and knowledge I am privy to in representing my
<br>
cases.
<br>
<p>I would suggest, in fact, that I have a reasonable good track record at
<br>
attempting to determine the correct and and accurate depiction of historic
<br>
and political events.  I submit to those who would comment on my nature the
<br>
most significant recent political postings I have done.

<br>
<p>In the previous three posts, I attempted to analyze the available
<br>
information to sufficient depth to present an unbiased and objectively
<br>
accurate description of the events.  In fact, I have previously presented to
<br>
the extropian list an effort to persue this (an empirical and unbiased
<br>
historical account) as an official task.  Since no information is more
<br>
valuable than accurate informtion, and no such resource exists (that I know
<br>
of) I thought it a valid and extropic effort.  I must note, however, I
<br>
recieved no responses to the suggestion.  However, the previous three posts
<br>
are a superficial attempt on my part to acheive such a goal.
