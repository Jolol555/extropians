<em>&gt; Regards from the Kill Files
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I never had and never will have such a device as a kill file. I do read the
<br>
postings of people whose opinions are diametrically oppposed to mine. I even
<br>
believe it is cynical to put people in a virtual trap and call it kill file.
<br>
<p>You accuse me of not presenting arguments. I don't do so anymore, because it
<br>
is absolutely useless. You (plural; the patriots here) twist around the
<br>
words of your opponents, as soon as they leave their mouths and from time to
<br>
time make violent and world conquering statements that leave me speechless.
<br>
The only level I can still &quot;talk&quot; about the Bush politics and the
<br>
extropian's shouts of acclamation are my fruitless attempts to kick you
<br>
right in the ass for it from across the Atlantic.
<br>
<p>Now you will certainly ask me to show you a proof of your violence in the
<br>
archives, but I tiredly refuse to do so, and I don't even care what you
<br>
think about it. Keep on claiming I was writing rubbish, I do not care. If
<br>
you don't FEEL - yes, the extropian buzz word - that you are deathly wrong
<br>
and that you (plural) were fucked up by your humble servants called Bush
<br>
administration, there is nothing I can do to bring you back on the path of
<br>
decency.
<br>
<p>I must not win all the time. I grant myself the right of failing to convince
<br>
someone if my ability to think of further arguments fails. As you might have
<br>
realized I even fell silent and did not participate in the debates anymore.
<br>
<p>I am sick and tired of this American madness to be a winner all
<br>
the time. I wish, you as a nation might relax a bit and leave the world in
<br>
peace with your eternal winner attitude.
<br>
<p>To hear from you now explicitely that this war was just and even extropic, I
<br>
refuse to be rational, behave as a good boy should, delete my adjectives and
<br>
stay polite. And I can tell you, I am glad, that I feel this way. Shows me
<br>
that I am still alive and shows me that I am right not to discuss the
<br>
reasons of war on a rational political level. How could I ever be
<br>
able to change your mind if you don't FEEL anymore that you are utterly
<br>
wrong on a basic human level. It's useless. I don't reach you. We don't come
<br>
together. But it's okay, I don't mind, I must not be friends with
<br>
anybody who shows up and claims he is some kind of a transhumanist.
<br>
<p>Hey, all of you silent extropians, did you hear that? Michael Dickey
<br>
believes the
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IRAQ WAR WAS EXTROPIAN
<br>
<p>Now, I would love to hear a statement from those celebrities who came up
<br>
with the idea of extropianism a while ago. Maybe a voice or two from the
<br>
board of directors? Just to make sure if this is a general opinion, just to
<br>
understand why main contributors to the ideas of the movement like Eugen
<br>
Leitl withdrew from this list...
