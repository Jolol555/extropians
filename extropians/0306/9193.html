<p>
SKEPTICISM TODAY 
<br>
<p>The discovery of truth is prevented more effectively, not by the 
<br>
false appearance of things present and which mislead into error, not 
<br>
directly by weakness of the reasoning powers, but by preconceived 
<br>
opinion, by prejudice. Arthur Schopenhauer, German philosopher
<br>
(1788–1860)
<br>
<p>In 1993, the late parapsychologist Charles Honorton from the 
<br>
University of Edinburgh considered what skeptics of psi experiments 
<br>
used to claim, and what they no longer claimed. He demonstrated that 
<br>
virtually all of the skeptical arguments used to explain away psi 
<br>
over the years had been resolved through design of new experiments. 
<br>
This does not mean the experiments conducted today are &quot;perfect,&quot; 
<br>
because there is nothing perfect in the empirical sciences. But it 
<br>
does mean that the methods available today satisfy the most rigorous 
<br>
skeptical requirements for providing &quot;exceptional evidence.&quot; As 
<br>
we've seen, such experiments have been conducted, with successful 
<br>
results. 
<br>
<p>WHAT SKEPTICS USED TO CLAIM 
<br>
<p>Honorton pointed out that for many decades the standard skeptical 
<br>
assertion was that psi was impossible because it violated some ill-
<br>
specified physical laws, or because the effects were not repeatable. 
<br>
It was also easy to claim that any successful experiments were 
<br>
really due to chance or fraud. Today, informed skeptics no longer 
<br>
claim that the outcomes of psi experiments are due to mere chance 
<br>
because we know that some parapsychological effects are, to use 
<br>
skeptical psychologist Ray Hyman's words, &quot;astronomically 
<br>
significant.&quot; This is a key concession because it shifts the focus 
<br>
of the debate away from the mere existence of interesting effects to 
<br>
their proper interpretation. 
<br>
<p>The concession also drops the decades-long skeptical questions over 
<br>
the legitimacy of parapsychology as a science. It states, quite 
<br>
clearly, that skeptics who continue to repeat the same old 
<br>
assertions that parapsychology is a pseudoscience, or that there are 
<br>
no repeatable experiments, are not only uninformed about the state 
<br>
of parapsychology, they are also uninformed about the current state 
<br>
of skepticism! 
<br>
<p>Honorton then pointed out that skeptics no longer claim that there 
<br>
are any meaningful relationships between design flaws and 
<br>
experimental outcomes. This criticism was again based on the premise 
<br>
that psi did not exist, thus any psi effects observed in experiments 
<br>
must have been due to sloppy experimenters, flawed techniques or 
<br>
poor measurements. The assertion implied that if a scientist 
<br>
performed the proper, &quot;perfect&quot; psi experiment, that all claims for 
<br>
psi effects would disappear. The basic argument is flawed, of 
<br>
course, because all measurements contain some error. Nevertheless, 
<br>
the assertion is testable by comparing experimental outcomes with 
<br>
assessments of experimental quality. As we've seen, the meta-
<br>
analyses described earlier have shown that design flaws cannot 
<br>
account for the cumulative success rates in psi experiments. 
<br>
<p>The skeptics are not eager to advertise their recent concessions. 
<br>
Over the past few decades Ray Hyman and other &quot;professional&quot; 
<br>
skeptics have tried with great creativity and diligence to explain 
<br>
away psi. They tried to show that the experiments were not really 
<br>
all that interesting, and that all of the apparently successful 
<br>
studies were due to one or another design flaws. Having failed on 
<br>
both counts, informed skeptics have been forced to admit that they 
<br>
have simply run out of plausible explanations. 
<br>
<p>It is not easy to change life-long, strongly held beliefs, even when 
<br>
there is strong evidence that the belief is wrong, so the publicly 
<br>
proclaimed skeptics are not likely to ever admit that psi per se is 
<br>
genuine. Nevertheless, it is important to emphasize that the focus 
<br>
of today's controversy has significantly shifted from the flat 
<br>
dismissals of the past. 
<br>
<p>WHAT SKEPTICS NOW CLAIM 
<br>
<p>Because no plausible explanations remain for the experimental 
<br>
results, today the few remaining hard-core skeptics rehash the same 
<br>
old polemical arguments used in past decades. The core assertion is 
<br>
the tired claim that after 100 years of research, parapsychology has 
<br>
failed to provide convincing evidence for psi phenomena. 
<br>
<p>This argument follows a certain logic. Skeptics refuse to believe 
<br>
that psi experiments, which they admit are successfully 
<br>
demonstrating something, are in fact actually demonstrating psi 
<br>
itself. By stubbornly insisting that the results are real and 
<br>
unexplainable on the one hand, but those results could not possibly 
<br>
be due to psi on the other, then of course they can claim that 
<br>
parapsychology is a failure. This is like a skeptic who refuses to 
<br>
call a group of nine players who win the World Series a &quot;baseball 
<br>
team.&quot; In that case, the skeptic can simply smile, shrug and 
<br>
doggedly claim that yes, people do apparently go running after balls 
<br>
that other people occasionally hit with a bat. But still, after 100 
<br>
years there is no solid evidence that anything called a baseball 
<br>
team actually exists. 
<br>
<p>Remember that most parapsychologists do not claim to understand 
<br>
what &quot;psi&quot; is. Instead, they design experiments designed to test 
<br>
experiences that people have reported throughout history. If 
<br>
rigorous tests for what we have called &quot;telepathy&quot; results in 
<br>
effects that look like, sound like, and feel like the experiences 
<br>
reported in real life, then call it what you will, but the 
<br>
experiments confirm that this common experience is not an illusion. 
<br>
<p>Another way to demonstrate the purely rhetorical nature of 
<br>
the &quot;century of failure&quot; argument is to see if the same argument 
<br>
also applies to conventional academic psychology. After a hundred 
<br>
years and thousands of experiments, there are still vigorous 
<br>
controversies over such elementary phenomena as conscious awareness, 
<br>
memory, learning, and perception. After a hundred years, psychology 
<br>
has not produced even the crudest model of how processes in the 
<br>
brain are transformed into conscious experience. If we adopt the 
<br>
skeptics' reasoning, many of whom are psychologists, then 
<br>
conventional psychology is also a dismal failure. 
<br>
<p>AN UNUSUAL CONTROVERSY 
<br>
<p>After deftly exposing and dissolving the skeptical position, 
<br>
Honorton then pointed out an important difference between the 
<br>
controversy over psi and debates in more conventional disciplines. 
<br>
Most scientific debates occur within groups of researchers who test 
<br>
hypotheses, develop and critique other researchers' methods, and 
<br>
collect data to test their hypotheses. This is standard operating 
<br>
procedure, as witnessed by persistent debates over dozens of hot 
<br>
topics in all scientific disciplines. The same sort of vigorous 
<br>
debating is evident in the journals and at the annual meetings of 
<br>
the Parapsychological Association, the professional society of 
<br>
scientists and scholars interested in psi phenomena. 
<br>
<p>However, the psi controversy is different in one important respect. 
<br>
The vast majority of skeptics often write about the plausibility of 
<br>
various alternative hypotheses, but they almost never test their 
<br>
ideas. This &quot;armchair quarterbacking&quot; is especially true of the 
<br>
current generation of psi skeptics, the vast majority of whom have 
<br>
made no original research contributions to this topic. 
<br>
<p>Their reasoning is simple: If you start from the position that an 
<br>
effect cannot exist, then why bother going to all the time and 
<br>
expense to actually study it? It makes more sense to use every 
<br>
rhetorical trick in the book to convince others that your opinion is 
<br>
correct, and that all the evidence to the contrary is somehow 
<br>
flawed. This may seem like a perfectly reasonable strategy, but it 
<br>
is not science. It is much closer to an argument based on faith, 
<br>
like a religious position. 
<br>
<p>The fact that most skeptics do not conduct counter-studies to prove 
<br>
their claims is not well known. For example, in 1983 the well known 
<br>
skeptic Martin Gardner wrote the following: 
<br>
<p>How can the public know that for fifty years skeptical psychologists 
<br>
have been trying their best to replicate classic psi experiments, 
<br>
and with notable unsuccess [sic]? It is this fact more than any 
<br>
other that has led to parapsychology's perpetual stagnation. 
<br>
Positive evidence keeps coming from a tiny group of enthusiasts, 
<br>
while negative evidence keeps coming from a much larger group of 
<br>
skeptics. As Honorton points out, &quot;Gardner does not attempt to 
<br>
document this assertion, nor could he. It is pure fiction. Look for 
<br>
the skeptics' experiments and see what you find.&quot; In addition,
<br>
there is no &quot;larger group of skeptics.&quot; There are perhaps 10 to 15 
<br>
skeptics who have accounted for the vast bulk of the published 
<br>
criticisms. 
<br>
<p>Beyond the &quot;century of failure&quot; argument, some skeptics still 
<br>
stubbornly insist that parapsychology is not a &quot;real science.&quot; As 
<br>
Ray Hyman wrote, 
<br>
<p>Every science except parapsychology builds upon its previous data. 
<br>
The data base continually expands with each new generation but the 
<br>
original investigations are still included. In parapsychology, the 
<br>
data base expands very little because previous experiments are 
<br>
continually discarded and new ones take their place.
<br>
<p>This isn't true, because otherwise the meta-analyses described in 
<br>
this book wouldn't exist. As we've seen, the early tests on
<br>
thought-transference gave rise to picture-drawing telepathy tests. 
<br>
They spawned telepathy experiments in the dream state, which later 
<br>
led to the ganzfeld experiments. The dice tests begat RNG 
<br>
experiments. All of these experimental variations evolved as 
<br>
researchers took stock of previous experimental outcomes and 
<br>
criticisms and refined their test designs and theories. 
<br>
<p>Of course, some skeptics have made important contributions to the 
<br>
development of progressively stronger evidence by systematically 
<br>
ferreting out design loop-holes, and by insisting upon stronger and 
<br>
stronger empirical evidence. But because skeptics today can no 
<br>
longer demonstrate plausible alternative explanations, all that 
<br>
remains is rhetoric and defense of a priori beliefs. Persisting in 
<br>
this stance in the face of overwhelming evidence has produced some 
<br>
excellent examples of minds struggling with logical contradictions. 
<br>
Honorton summarized his view of the state of skepticism as follows: 
<br>
<p>There is a danger for science in encouraging self-appointed 
<br>
protectors who engage in polemical campaigns that distort and 
<br>
misrepresent serious research efforts. Such campaigns are not only 
<br>
counterproductive, they threaten to corrupt the spirit and function 
<br>
of science and raise doubts about its credibility. The distorted 
<br>
history, logical contradictions, and factual omissions exhibited in 
<br>
the arguments of the … critics represent neither scholarly
<br>
criticism nor skepticism, but rather counteradvocacy masquerading as 
<br>
skepticism.
<br>
<p>SKEPTICAL TACTICS 
<br>
<p>Extreme skeptics who believe that all psi experiments are flawed 
<br>
have used an effective bag of rhetorical tactics to try to convince 
<br>
others to dismiss the evidence. These include accusations that even 
<br>
if real, psi effects are so weak that they are trivial or 
<br>
uninteresting, statements of frank prejudice, long lists of common 
<br>
but scientifically invalid criticisms, and severely distorted 
<br>
descriptions of psi experiments which make psi researchers appear to 
<br>
be incompetent. Let's examine how some these tactics have been
<br>
used. 
<br>
<p>ACCUSATIONS OF TRIVIALITY 
<br>
<p>Some skeptics have reluctantly accepted that psi effects may be 
<br>
genuine. But then they attempted to reduce their discomfort by 
<br>
claiming that psi is simply too weak to be interesting. For example, 
<br>
the psychologist E. G. Boring wrote that ESP data were merely &quot;an 
<br>
empty correlation,&quot; and psychologist S. S. Stevens asserted 
<br>
that &quot;the signal-to-noise ratio for ESP is simply too low to be 
<br>
interesting.&quot; 
<br>
<p>More recently, the skeptical British psychologist Susan Blackmore 
<br>
wrote &quot;What if my doubt is displaced and there really is 
<br>
extrasensory perception after all? What would this tell us about 
<br>
consciousness?&quot; To answer this question, Blackmore took a giant step 
<br>
backwards to the 1950s psychological fad of behaviorism, and 
<br>
concluded that consciousness doesn't have any meaning at all,
<br>
that it is merely an illusion. Not surprisingly then, she also 
<br>
concluded that psi, even if genuine, would tell us nothing at all 
<br>
about the nature of consciousness. This is a perplexing position 
<br>
that hardly anyone accepts anymore, not even other hard-nosed 
<br>
skeptics. 
<br>
<p>In another example of trivializing psi, mathematician A. J. Ayer 
<br>
wrote in Scientific American, 
<br>
<p>The only thing that is remarkable about the subject who is credited 
<br>
with extra-sensory perception is that he is consistently rather 
<br>
better at guessing cards than the ordinary run of people have shown 
<br>
themselves to be. The fact that he also does &quot;better than chance&quot; 
<br>
proves nothing in itself.
<br>
<p>Such an assertion is confused, because any form of genuine psi, weak 
<br>
or strong, carries revolutionary potential for our understanding of 
<br>
the natural world. In addition, effects that are originally observed 
<br>
as weak may be turned into extremely strong effects after they are 
<br>
better understood. Consider, for example, what was known about 
<br>
harnessing the weak, erratic trickles of electricity 150 years ago, 
<br>
and compare that to the trillion-watt networks that run today's 
<br>
power-hungry world. 
<br>
<p>PREJUDICE
<br>
<p>Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge; it 
<br>
is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so 
<br>
positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by 
<br>
science. Charles Darwin, Introduction, The Descent of Man (1871).
<br>
Prejudice – holding an opinion without knowledge or examination
<br>
of the facts – is deeply embedded within human nature. It is much 
<br>
easier to follow the natural impulse to form a quick judgment and 
<br>
stick with it, rather than take the time and trouble to study the 
<br>
actual evidence. Prejudice continues to haunt psi researchers. 
<br>
Sometimes it is acknowledged as such, and sometimes it is not. 
<br>
<p>Philip Anderson, a prominent theoretical physicist at Princeton 
<br>
University, assumed that psi was incompatible with physics, and so 
<br>
in an 1990 editorial in Physics Today, he wrote, 
<br>
<p>If such results are correct, we might as well turn the National 
<br>
Institute of Standards and Technology into a casino and our physics 
<br>
classes into seances, and give back all those Nobel Prizes…. It
<br>
is for this kind of reason that physicists, quite properly, do not 
<br>
take such experiments seriously until they can be (1) reproduced (2) 
<br>
by independent, skeptical researchers (3) under maximum security 
<br>
conditions and (4) with totally incontrovertible statistics. Oddly 
<br>
enough, the parapsychologists who claim positive results invariably 
<br>
reject these conditions.
<br>
<p>It is clear that Anderson was simply ignorant of the evidence, and 
<br>
yet he still felt quite confident about his opinion. We can only 
<br>
imagine what Anderson thinks of well-regarded physicists who do take 
<br>
such experiments seriously. 
<br>
<p>Some critics have acknowledged that they simply do not wish to 
<br>
believe the evidence. For example, in 1951, the psychologist Donald 
<br>
O. Hebb wrote: &quot;Why do we not accept ESP as a psychological fact? 
<br>
Rhine has offered us enough evidence to have convinced us on almost 
<br>
any other issue..... I cannot see what other basis my colleagues 
<br>
have for rejecting it..... My own rejection of [Rhine's] views is
<br>
in a literal sense prejudice.&quot; 
<br>
<p>In 1955, psychologist G. R. Price suggested that because psi was 
<br>
clearly impossible, fraud was the best, and really the only 
<br>
remaining explanation for psi effects. In a lead article in the 
<br>
important journal, Science, Price began sensibly: 
<br>
<p>Believers in psychic phenomena ... appear to have won a decisive 
<br>
victory and virtually silenced opposition.... This victory is the 
<br>
result of an impressive amount of careful experimentation and 
<br>
intelligent argumentation.... Against all this evidence, almost the 
<br>
only defense remaining to the skeptical scientist is ignorance, 
<br>
ignorance concerning the work itself and concerning its 
<br>
implications. The typical scientist contents himself with 
<br>
retaining ... some criticism that at most applies to a small 
<br>
fraction of the published studies. But these findings (which 
<br>
challenge our very concepts of space and time) are - if valid - of 
<br>
enormous importance ... so they ought not to be ignored.
<br>
<p>Price then flatly asserted that because ESP was &quot;incompatible with 
<br>
current scientific theory,&quot; it was more reasonable to believe that 
<br>
parapsychologists cheated than that ESP might be real. Price based 
<br>
his argument on a famous essay on the nature of miracles by 
<br>
philosopher David Hume. Hume argued that since we know that people 
<br>
sometimes lie, but we have no independent evidence of miracles, then 
<br>
it is more reasonable to believe that claims of miracles are based 
<br>
on lies than that miracles actually occurred. Based on this 
<br>
reasoning, Price concluded, 
<br>
<p>My opinion concerning the findings of the parapsychologists is that 
<br>
many of them are dependent on clerical and statistical errors and 
<br>
unintentional use of sensory clues, and that all extrachance results 
<br>
not so explicable are dependent on deliberate fraud or mildly 
<br>
abnormal mental conditions.
<br>
<p>Another critic of the same era was skeptical British psychologist 
<br>
Mark Hansel, from the University of Wales. Like Price, Hansel wrote, 
<br>
<p>If the result could have been through a trick, the experiment must 
<br>
be considered unsatisfactory proof of ESP, whether or not it is 
<br>
finally decided that such a trick was, in fact, used (p. 21). 
<br>
[Therefore,] it is wise to adopt initially the assumption that ESP 
<br>
is impossible, since there is a great weight of knowledge supporting 
<br>
this point of view.
<br>
<p>Such opinions – that existing scientific knowledge is complete
<br>
and that psi necessarily conflicts with it – has motivated
<br>
skeptics to imagine all sorts of good reasons to make the psi &quot;go 
<br>
away.&quot; A prime example of the power of this motivation is 
<br>
illustrated by a 1987 report on parapsychology issued by the 
<br>
National Research Council. 
<br>
<p>NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL REPORT 
<br>
<p>In the mid-1980s, the U. S. Army recruitment slogan was &quot;Be all that 
<br>
you can be.&quot; The slogan reflected the Army's desire to train 
<br>
soldiers to achieve enhanced performance. These highly trained 
<br>
warriors would be fearless and cunning, fight without fatigue, and 
<br>
employ a variety of enhanced, exotic, or possibly even psychic 
<br>
skills. 
<br>
<p>In 1984, the U. S. Army Research Institute asked the premier 
<br>
scientific body in the United States, the National Academy of 
<br>
Sciences, to evaluate a variety of training techniques and claims 
<br>
about enhanced human performance. These techniques included sleep 
<br>
learning, accelerated learning, biofeedback, neurolinguistic 
<br>
programming, and parapsychology. The National Academy of Sciences 
<br>
responded to the Army's request by directing its principal
<br>
operating agency, the National Research Council (NRC), to form a 
<br>
committee to examine the scientific evidence in these areas. Because 
<br>
the NRC is often asked to investigate leading-edge and controversial 
<br>
topics, it maintains an explicit policy of assembling balanced 
<br>
scientific committees. In fact, the policy requires members of its 
<br>
committees to affirm that they have no conflicts of interest either 
<br>
for or against the objects of study. This helps ensure that the 
<br>
scientific reviews are fair. 
<br>
<p>On December 3, 1987, the NRC convened a well-attended press 
<br>
conference in Washington, DC, to announce its conclusions. John A. 
<br>
Swets, Chairman of the NRC Committee, said, &quot;Perhaps our strongest 
<br>
conclusions are in the area of parapsychology.&quot; The bottom 
<br>
line: &quot;The Committee finds no scientific justification from research 
<br>
conducted over a period of 130 years for the existence of 
<br>
parapsychological phenomena.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Whoops. Where did this come from? To help understand the disparity 
<br>
between the actual data and the NRC's conclusion, the Board of 
<br>
Directors of the Parapsychological Association (PA) selected three 
<br>
senior members of the PA to study the report in detail and respond 
<br>
to it. The three members were John Palmer, a psychologist at the 
<br>
Rhine Research Center, Durham, North Carolina, Charles Honorton, who 
<br>
at the time was Director of the Psychophysical Research Laboratories 
<br>
in Princeton, New Jersey, and Jessica Utts, professor of statistics 
<br>
at the University of California, Davis. 
<br>
<p>After some study, the PA committee issued its report, with three 
<br>
main findings. First, the two principal evaluators of psi research 
<br>
for the NRC Committee, psychologists Ray Hyman and James Alcock, 
<br>
both had long histories of skeptical publications accusing 
<br>
parapsychology of not even being a legitimate science. In contrast, 
<br>
there were no active psi researchers on the Committee. This violated 
<br>
the NRC's policy of assigning members to committees &quot;with regard
<br>
to appropriate balance.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Second, the NRC's report avoided mentioning studies favorable to
<br>
psi research but quoted liberally from two background papers that 
<br>
supported the Committee's position. As if this were not enough,
<br>
the Chairman of the NRC Committee phoned one of the authors of a 
<br>
third commissioned background paper, Robert Rosenthal from Harvard 
<br>
University, and asked him to withdraw his conclusions because they 
<br>
were favorable to parapsychology. 
<br>
<p>And third, the NRC report was self-contradictory. The Committee 
<br>
widely advertised its conclusion that there was no evidence for psi 
<br>
phenomena, yet the report itself admits that the Committee members 
<br>
could offer no plausible alternatives to the research it surveyed. 
<br>
The Committee failed to mention in the press conference that they 
<br>
recommended that the Army continue to monitor psi research in the 
<br>
United States and the former Soviet Union. They even recommended 
<br>
that the Army propose specific experiments to be conducted. The 
<br>
contrast between the NRC's advertised position and their actual 
<br>
position suggests that there were conflicts between reporting a fair 
<br>
evaluation of the data and what was politically expedient to report. 
<br>
<p>This was clearly revealed later when a newspaper reporter for The 
<br>
Chronicle of Higher Education asked the NRC Committee Chairman, John 
<br>
Swets, why he asked Rosenthal to withdraw his favorable conclusions. 
<br>
Swets replied: &quot;We thought the quality of our analysis was better, 
<br>
and we didn't see much point in putting out mixed signals&quot;. Swets 
<br>
explained, &quot;I didn't feel we were obliged to represent every
<br>
point of view.&quot; This meant the NRC Committee in effect had created 
<br>
a &quot;filedrawer&quot; of ignored positive studies that they didn't wish
<br>
to talk about. Apparently, the only acceptable views about psi for 
<br>
this committee were negative ones. Given the true nature of the 
<br>
evidence, this was bound to lead to some major contradictions. 
<br>
<p>And it did. The NRC Committee commissioned ten background papers by 
<br>
experts in a variety of fields. One of these papers, by Dale Griffin 
<br>
of Stanford University, explained how difficult it is to objectively 
<br>
evaluate evidence when one is already publicly committed to a 
<br>
particular belief. According to Griffin, 
<br>
<p>Probably the most powerful force motivating our desire to protect 
<br>
our beliefs – from others' attacks, from our own questioning,
<br>
and from the challenge of new evidence – is commitment .... This
<br>
drive to avoid dissonance is especially strong when the belief has 
<br>
led to public commitment.
<br>
<p>The Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the 
<br>
Paranormal (CSICOP) is an organization well-known for its 
<br>
impassioned commitment against parapsychology. Ray Hyman was one of 
<br>
the original &quot;Fellows&quot; of CSICOP, and he was an active member of its 
<br>
Executive Council at the same time he was evaluating psi research 
<br>
for the NRC. So the source of many contradictions in the NRC report 
<br>
is clear: Hyman's publicly committed position as a psychic
<br>
debunker. 
<br>
<p>For example, at the NRC press conference, Hyman confirmed his public 
<br>
stance by announcing that the &quot;poor quality of psi research was
<br>
`a surprise to us all – we believed the work would be of much
<br>
higher quality than it turned out to be.' &quot; Yet, in contrast to
<br>
this public statement, the report itself actually says, &quot;… the
<br>
best 
<br>
research [in parapsychology] is of higher quality than many critics 
<br>
assume ….&quot; 
<br>
<p>Furthermore, in contrast to the NRC's public assertions about
<br>
&quot;poor quality research,&quot; and &quot;no scientific justification,&quot; was the 
<br>
actual paper commissioned by the NRC to review psi experiments and 
<br>
other studies of performance-enhancing techniques. Authored by 
<br>
psychologists Monica Harris and Robert Rosenthal of Harvard 
<br>
University, the report concluded that, 
<br>
<p>The situation for the ganzfeld domain seems reasonably clear. We 
<br>
feel it would be implausible to entertain the null [hypothesis] 
<br>
given the combined [probability] from these 28 studies.... When the 
<br>
accuracy rate expected under the null [hypothesis] is 1/4, we 
<br>
estimate the obtained accuracy rate to be about 1/3.
<br>
<p>In non-technical language, Harris and Rosenthal concluded that there 
<br>
was persuasive evidence for something very interesting going on in 
<br>
the ganzfeld experiments because they found an average hit rate of 
<br>
about 33% rather than the 25% expected by chance (as we discussed in 
<br>
Chapter 6). They also compared the quality of the ganzfeld 
<br>
experiments to experiments in four other, non-parapsychological 
<br>
research areas and concluded that &quot;only the ganzfeld ESP studies 
<br>
regularly meet the basic requirements of sound experimental design.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Without belaboring the point, it is clear that abject prejudice 
<br>
exists in science as it does in all human endeavors. It was detected 
<br>
fairly easily in the case of the NRC Report by comparing the public 
<br>
pronouncements with what the report actually says. Sometimes it is 
<br>
not so easy to detect, because we usually do not stop to think that 
<br>
some skeptical criticisms are simply invalid.
