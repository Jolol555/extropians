<p>That's why I said &quot;stop loss orders&quot;. 10-15 years ago it
<br>
was reasonably difficult for the average investor to get
<br>
daily range data for stocks -- now it is not.  So all
<br>
historic studies on investor success probably need to
<br>
be redone because it was very difficult to do reasonable
<br>
technical analysis -- given the data availability and the
<br>
speed of computers now its a piece of cake.  The same
<br>
is probably true (about the historic studies not being
<br>
worth the paper they are printed on) can probably also
<br>
be made because of the development of derivatives
<br>
('70's or '80s if I recall).  There are probably other
<br>
examples of changes -- the decline in broker's fees,
<br>
the development of off-market trading (so you can
<br>
respond to news announcements after the markets are
<br>
closed if you are clever enough to watch for them).
<br>
<p>[snip]
<br>
<em>&gt; That fund was hammered worse than all the others, as nearly
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Then one had a pretty stupid fund manager (or was they
<br>
were getting bad advice from the analysts -- we know
<br>
how much the analysts cooked things over the last
<br>
few years because the investment banking side of
<br>
the brokerage firms wanted the fees).
<br>
<p>How many investors (or brokers for that matter) actually
<br>
take the time to *read* the annual reports, watch the
<br>
insider trades or read all the required SEC filings, etc?
<br>
Investing properly is really hard work.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is a filter in place: people talk a lot more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about their winners than their losers, causing others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to think they are net winners.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; This explained something that puzzled me: why my fund
</em><br>
<em>&gt; managers were achieving only market average over the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long haul, or actually not even market average.
</em><br>
<p>Rafal may have explained part of the explanation.
<br>
Most fund managers have to diversify their holdings
<br>
(to try and protect themselves from Enron/Worldcom
<br>
like situations).  If you have to diversify that much
<br>
its hard to have enough time to accumulate the information
<br>
to pick winners and avoid losers.  By the time you take
<br>
out a couple of % in fund administration fees you are
<br>
already under the average market return.
