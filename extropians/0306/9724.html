<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If C is defined as the fastest speed in the universe, does that change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; result of E=MC2 calculations? Or could it be that they are invalid and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; have never been empirically validated?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No. The c of importance is the velocity that is left invariant by all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Lorenz transformations. It just happens historically that it was first
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; empirically observed that light moves at the same velocity regardless of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the speed of the observer,
</em><br>
<p>Does gravity move at the same velocity regardless of the speed of the
<br>
observer?
<br>
<p>Is the speed of gravity invariant?
<br>
<p>Doesn't light move at significantly different speeds in certain mediums?
<br>
If so, why choose 186,000 m/sec as the invariant speed?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;and then the attempts to explain this
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; observation led to the relativity postulates (roughly, that there exists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this kind of invariant velocity and that physics looks the same in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inertial frames). From this one can then derive testable (and indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; tested) predictions like length contraction, time dilation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; mass-energy equivalence. E=mc^2 is a consequence of the postulates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, if one tries to use a c in the calculations that is not the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; invariant speed then there will be a systematic discrepancy from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; momentum and time dilation effects observed in every particle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accelerator. It could of course be that physical light moves slightly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slower than the invariant velocity (light moves slower than c in many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; media, and it is a common textbook exercise to show how the relativity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; equations would look if everything was filled with a refractive ether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that made it slower), but in this case the difference has to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extremely small and cosmological constraints (see below) limit it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If something moves faster than the invariant speed there will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; reference frames where it moves at arbitrary speeds, including backwards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in time. So FTL gravity waves would likely end up having the same bad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; effects on cosmology as finite speed photons, even when ignoring the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; causality issue.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To sum up, special relativity has a very simple and elegant mathematical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; form. The invariant velocity c is a bit like the invariant number 1 in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; multiplication; it has to exist in the group structure of Lorenz
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transformations. It does not say anything about whether there are things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that move at that speed or not in physics, or even whether physics obeys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Lorenz group. That is just experimental observations, which seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fit extremely well.
</em><br>
<p>I think this &quot;just&quot; is very important. Could you please give the citation
<br>
for an experimental-empirical verification of E=mc2? For example, has a
<br>
nuclear reactor ever published empirical reports on the reduction of mass
<br>
as it burns fuel?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; [Cosmological constraints: Because if photons can move at other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; velocities than the invariant velocity (if they move slowly we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; always set up a fast moving lab moving alongside to examine photons at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest - this is actually a good Gedankenexperiment to see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; electromagnetic waves have to move at the invariant speed; you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have a stationary wave packet in vacuum) they would have a rest mass.
</em><br>
<p>Don't the experiments by Alain Aspect and others show that a photon can be
<br>
move in two different directions and can be measured in two different
<br>
places at the same time? &quot;They&quot; arrive at the final, measured locations
<br>
faster than 186,000 m/sec do they not?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Given the relativity equations (still valid even if light is slow) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the observable energy E of a photon at speed v we get:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; m_0 = E^2/[v^2 c^2/(c^2-v^2) + c^4]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If v is close to c and E close to the observed pc value, then m_0 will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; be extremely small. Putting E=h nu (Planck's relation) into it we get a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest mass for photons of frequency nu:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; m_0 = h^2 nu^2/[v^2 c^2/(c^2-v^2) + c^4]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Note that for small nu m_0 becomes even smaller.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Particles with a finite rest mass m_0 will be generated in processes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; above energy 2 m_0 c^2 (another experimentally observed fact). This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; means that during the big bang a certain fraction of the energy ought to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have ended up as photons just as it did with neutrinos and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; electron/positron pairs. But adding a rest mass completely messes up the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; amount of photons at different frequencies - the spectrum would not end
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; up as the blackbody spectrum we all know and love, but rather look like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the other particle spectra that are predicted in cosmology. In addition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a lot of slow photons would have been able to manifest at lower
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; energies, cooling down the universe and objects in it much faster than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; otherwise. In fact, it would change all blackbody spectra, so I guess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the constraint isn't really cosmological but experimental - if photons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; could move slower than the invariant speed we would see a very different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world. ]
