<p><em>&gt; I see the debate as between those who agree with Harvey that it is all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a matter of semantics (and I am one of them), and those who see it as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much more significant, with an underlying, important factual issue about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; survival that must be resolved.  It seems difficult to convincingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; justify the intuition in either case.
</em><br>
<p>If all the questions are oriented around *action*, then
<br>
either you will upload or you will not.  Either you will
<br>
sacrifice yourself for your duplicate or you will not.
<br>
The disagreements are substantive.
<br>
<p>I think that people's minds are being changed.  But I
<br>
also claim that people's beliefs would (and perhaps
<br>
will) alter dramatically after they've known a few
<br>
duplicates.  When every one of their intuitions is
<br>
telling them &quot;this really is the same person&quot;, the
<br>
older view will collapse.
<br>
<p>Will collapse, that is, except for those who'll stubbornly
<br>
resist the new view forever.  &quot;I still think that all you
<br>
are zombies&quot;, the old guy will say, &quot;all this teleporting
<br>
and duplicating and what not&quot;.  But I predict that the
<br>
younger generations will take it in stride.
