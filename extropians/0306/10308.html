<p><em>    &gt; In short, Nazism vs the Jews is a dead issue
</em><br>
<p>Exactly, and the Jews are smart enough to figure that out so they just want
<br>
to get on with their lives and have no interest in crashing airliners into
<br>
German skyscrapers. Muslims on the other hand still whine about ill
<br>
treatment by the crusaders 800 years ago and claim it helps fuels their
<br>
hatred even today. I don't believe a word of it. I don't think the bulk of
<br>
that hatred has anything to do with things the west did so I have no
<br>
confidence in the idea that if we radically changed our behavior we could
<br>
get them to love us; unless that is we started making such stupid decisions
<br>
that the West was declining even faster than Islamic civilization, then they
<br>
might indeed look on us as best buddies.
