<p>I didn't specify they should not have re-entered that day.
<br>
<p>What about people who were invested in March 2000?  Would your advice have
<br>
been to ride their $100+/share stocks down to the penny-stock ranks?  If
<br>
not, at what point would you have advised your clients to put a stop to
<br>
their bleeding securities?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You cannot argue that &quot;People who failed to properly time the market at

time
<br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Huh?  I wasn't talking about properly timing anything.  I was talking about
<br>
minimizing one's risks with stops.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But that is what you are arguing above.
</em><br>
<p>I am?  You took out the examples I gave you on DKWD and THC - that is what I
<br>
was giving you as examples to my argument that it was wise to use stops.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem of beating the market is a much larger and more difficult
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem than I think you currently imagine or understand.
</em><br>
<p>I'll defer to your experience.  But until I better understand what I
<br>
currently don't seem to understand ... I'll keep using those stops.
