Natasha,
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I think it is about time Ron or anyone who deliberately misrepresents you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;apologize now.
</em><br>
<p>I consider it a lost battle. It's rare that I ask for apologies, and
<br>
in this situation, I'm not asking. (Clearly he sees something very
<br>
different)
<br>
<p>In order to try to 'fix' this story, I would have to write a protest
<br>
to most responses {R.H.etal} has made to almost every political (and
<br>
many nonpolitical) links and/or messages I've written to this list
<br>
in the last ~two years. I tried in the beginning to correct what
<br>
errors I saw, but it became an enormous chore. The answer for me is
<br>
to not respond to what little that I read that misrepresents me. As
<br>
a note: I don't subscribe to this list, I disappear for days and
<br>
weeks when I'm on work and holiday travel, during large moves and so
<br>
on. Internet access for me is at a minimum, conserving my typing
<br>
hands is a daily concern as well (what I do write, therefore, means
<br>
that it is valuable enough for me to go through the effort.) I would
<br>
rather support my reputation in activities off of the extropians
<br>
email list.
<br>
<p>I do protest that absent periods and not reading/responding to 85%
<br>
of the messages here, implies consent or agreement of some topic.
<br>
Often I hear of what people have responded to my short links or
<br>
words via other people, and while it is annoying for me to sometimes
<br>
find my words or intention twisted (sometimes to the extreme), it's
<br>
not a conversation-clarification or battle that is worth my efforts
<br>
to fight. Perhaps for conversational clarity, it would be wise to
<br>
keep these extra communication lack-of-clues in mind when trying to
<br>
figure out what another person means. The best way to know what
<br>
someone means, however, is to ask them.
<br>
<p>Amara
