Sorry Steve
<br>
<p>The dictionaries and common usage agree with Damien's use of ilk. You 
<br>
are correct about the origins of ilk, but not how it is commonly used in 
<br>
English from 19th century onwards.
<br>
<p>In Canada, of course, you have to beware of ilk wandering in front of 
<br>
you on the highway.

<p><p>Re: ilk
<br>
(from Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary)
<br>
ilk noun [S] MAINLY DISAPPROVING
<br>
a particular type:
<br>
The worst of her criticism was reserved for journalists, photographers 
<br>
and others of their ilk.
<br>
<p><p>The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth 
<br>
Edition. 2000.
<br>
...Type or kind: can't trust people of that ilk.
<br>
Scots The same. Used following a name to indicate that the one named 
<br>
resides in an area bearing the same name: Duncan of that ilk
<br>
<p>[Middle English ilke, same, from Old English ilca. See i- in 
<br>
Indo-European Roots.]
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word History: When one uses ilk, as in the phrase men of his ilk, 
<br>
one is using a word with an ancient pedigree even though the sense of 
<br>
ilk, “kind or sort,” is actually quite recent, having been first 
<br>
recorded at the end of the 18th century. This sense grew out of an older 
<br>
use of ilk in the phrase of that ilk, meaning “of the same place, 
<br>
territorial designation, or name.” This phrase was used chiefly in names 
<br>
of landed families, Guthrie of that ilk meaning “Guthrie of Guthrie.” 
<br>
“Same” is the fundamental meaning of the word. The ancestors of ilk, Old 
<br>
English ilca and Middle English ilke, were common words, usually 
<br>
appearing with such words as the or that, but the word hardly survived 
<br>
the Middle Ages in those uses.
