This is too vague...Harvey, I appoint you 'Anti-pseudoscience 
<br>
monitor'...Give us _warnings_ of anything you feel falls into this 
<br>
category and tell us _why_ it does. I wholeheartedly agree with Brett on 
<br>
this one; we are quick to judge and condemn but don't seem so keen on 
<br>
coming up with better explanations or even teaching others what we know. 
<br>
There is _far_ too much criticism, derision, and assertion of error 
<br>
without proof and with quite a lot of rudeness on this list and hardly 
<br>
_any_ real help pointing people to where the truth lies. If people know 
<br>
truths they want to keep to themselves, that's fine.  But folks go for 
<br>
'erroneous soundbites' because they can't find anything better; there is 
<br>
nothing else available, and we'll live on bread and water until the 
<br>
cheesecake turns up. Show us a few slices of genuine cheesecake and 
<br>
we'll eat 'em. If you think the science on this list is 'crap', get in 
<br>
there and tell us _why_ it's crap and what bits of it are crap and prove 
<br>
it. Give us, (and I ask this without sarcasm, but genuinely,) the 
<br>
benefits of your wisdom.
<br>
I know it is a lot of hassle to explain things and you have to go 
<br>
through all the crap of worrying about offending people, being 
<br>
misunderstood, etc, but we are here on this list because we have 
<br>
something in common. It's called the singularity and we're here to 
<br>
_help_ each other and ourselves get through it in as positive and 
<br>
intelligent a way as we can.
<br>
Best,
<br>
AR
<br>
Finally, some 'simplified versions' can be good. A first-aid course is a 
<br>
simplified version of emergency health care and it still saves a lot of 
<br>
lives.
