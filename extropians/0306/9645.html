damaging to the list.
<br>
<p>Dr. Broderick,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are those that the mere act of defending the US or the Amercian 
<br>
government is tasteless.  However it is not groundless or personal to think 
<br>
that an American who does so has a personal interest in seeing America succeed.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MEZ states that he is middle eastern unless I made a mistake.  He is 
<br>
representing the middle eastern point of view.  It is not groundless and 
<br>
personal to assume he has the same motives as an American in the same position.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It grieves me that you consider an American supporting his country is 
<br>
&quot;groundless and personal.&quot;  It grieves me further that you have not found out 
<br>
what is going on in the middle east and consequently what danger MEZ family &amp; 
<br>
friends are in.  Should the US succeed in assisting Iraq lift itself up then 
<br>
MEZ' family &amp; friends are likely to be unable to hold their own population down 
<br>
any further.  People hanging by the neck from lamp poles comes to mind.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have a lot of sympathy for MEZ.  His people are in danger.  He is 
<br>
likely getting all sorts of pressure to help not only all he can and then to 
<br>
give help that he cannot possibly give.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I will not bow to a PC opinion that has gotten thousands killed by 
<br>
a madman and will in the future get thousands more killed.
<br>
Ron h.
