<p>How can you say it is not intelligent to sell a stock when you have good
<br>
reason to believe it is going to drop in price? If you had 4,000 shares of a
<br>
biotech stock like ImClone, and you had good reason to believe the FDA was
<br>
about to reject its flagship anti-cancer drug, then wouldn't you do
<br>
everything possible to get out of the stock?
<br>
<p>You can say it is never intelligent to break the law, but the law itself is
<br>
what is in dispute here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Too early to tell what the judgment will be, but from what I 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, order entry should be completely computerized now at Merrill. It was
<br>
half-way computerized when I left the firm more than ten years ago. Even
<br>
before computerization the stop-loss order would have been on record with
<br>
the firm's office at the NYSE. 
<br>
<p>A legitimate stop-loss order would be on the record somewhere -- not just in
<br>
the broker's handwritten notes -- but I'm not disputing the unethical nature
<br>
of the cover-up. I'm disputing the wisdom of the law that says she had
<br>
something to cover up. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The burden of proof will be on Martha to prove that this transaction 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was similar to her other stock transactions,
</em><br>
<p>The burden of proof is never on the accused.
