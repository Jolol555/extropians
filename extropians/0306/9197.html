<a href="mailto:jrd1415@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20IRAQ:%20Weapons%20of%20Mass%20Delusion">jrd1415@yahoo.com</a> writes: The neocons have their agenda.  If they can get the American troops 
<br>
out of the way, which is to say get a puppet regime in place, complete with 
<br>
an effective and disciplined security force, then they can temporarily have 
<br>
their way. 
<br>
<p>Jeff,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Am I wrong?  That selection seems representative of you post?  Let me 
<br>
know if you are wrong?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway you seem to be making too much stew out of one oyster.  We know 
<br>
he had WMDs he used them in Iran and against the Kurds.  We know he 
<br>
threatened us with WMDs, his General Gas said so -- if General Gas didn't have the 
<br>
wherewithal to back himself up that is his problem.  We know he had the labs to 
<br>
make the weapons, we have captured them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime you said, &quot;The neocons have their agenda,&quot; and gave 
<br>
away your agenda.  The only people that call them neo-cons are outsiders and 
<br>
political opponents.  I had never even heard the term until suddenly the 
<br>
political opposition opened up with vicious attacks on every list I follow.  (Sorry, I 
<br>
haven't heard the term on the middle eastern site, yet)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You follow too closely to be considered an outsider so I assume you 
<br>
are an opponent.  Why don't you go ahead and identify yourself in clear 
<br>
unmistakable English and tell us all the benefits your party has planned for us?  It 
<br>
would be the honest thing to do.
<br>
Ron h.
