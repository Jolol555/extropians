I thought this was interesting:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;A third of the American public believes U.S. forces found weapons of 
<br>
mass destruction in Iraq, according to a recent poll, and 22 percent 
<br>
said Iraq actually used chemical or biological weapons.
<br>
<p>But no such weapons have been found, nor is there evidence they were 
<br>
used recently in Iraq.
<br>
<p>Before the war, half of those polled in a survey said Iraqis were among 
<br>
the 19 hijackers on Sept. 11, 2001. But most of them were from Saudi 
<br>
Arabia. None were Iraqis.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>&quot;Given the intensive news coverage and high levels of public attention,&quot; 
<br>
he said, &quot;this level of misinformation suggests some Americans may be 
<br>
avoiding having an experience of cognitive dissonance.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is, having their beliefs conflict with the facts.
<br>
<p>Kull said the poll's data showed the mistaken belief that weapons of 
<br>
mass destruction were found &quot;is substantially greater among those who 
<br>
favored the war.&quot;&gt;&gt;
<br>

<br>
<p>Oh, in case you missed it, the latest 'smoking sun' (the two alleged WMD 
<br>
production trailers) is another Bush lie, per 'an official British 
<br>
investigation':
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;An official British investigation into two trailers found in northern 
<br>
Iraq has concluded they are not mobile germ warfare labs, as was claimed 
<br>
by Tony Blair and President George Bush, but were for the production of 
<br>
hydrogen to fill artillery balloons, as the Iraqis have continued to insist.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>The revelation that the mobile labs were to produce hydrogen for 
<br>
artillery balloons will also cause discomfort for the British 
<br>
authorities because the Iraqi army's original system was sold to it by 
<br>
the British company, Marconi Command &amp; Control.&gt;&gt;
