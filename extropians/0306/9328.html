<br>
&nbsp;A low-fat, whole-food vegan diet, as well as other strategies that
<br>
down-regulate IGF-I activity, may slow the human aging process.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;A considerable amount of evidence is consistent with the proposition that
<br>
systemic IGF-I activity acts as pacesetter in the aging process. A
<br>
reduction in IGF-I activity is the common characteristic of rodents whose
<br>
maximal lifespan has been increased by a wide range of genetic or dietary
<br>
measures,including caloric restriction. The lifespans of breeds of dogs
<br>
and strains of rats tend to be inversely proportional to their mature
<br>
weight and IGF-I levels. The link between IGF-I and aging appears to be
<br>
evolutionarily conserved; in worms and flies, lifespan is increased by
<br>
reduction-of-function mutations in signaling intermediates homologous to
<br>
those which mediate insulin/IGF-I activity in mammals. The fact that an
<br>
increase in IGF-I activity plays a key role in the induction of sexual
<br>
maturity, is consistent with a broader role for-IGF-I in aging
<br>
regulation. If down-regulation of IGF-I activity could indeed slow aging
<br>
in humans, a range of practical measures for achieving this may be at
<br>
hand. These include a low-fat, whole-food, vegan diet, exercise training,
<br>
soluble fiber, insulin sensitizers, appetite suppressants, and agents
<br>
such as flax lignans, oral estrogen, or tamoxifen that decrease hepatic
<br>
synthesis of IGF-I. Many of these measures would also be expected to
<br>
decrease risk for common age-related diseases.
<br>
&nbsp;Regimens combining several of these approaches might have a sufficient
<br>
impact on IGF-I activity to achieve a useful retardation of the aging
<br>
process. However, in light of the fact that IGF-I promotes endothelial
<br>
production of nitric oxide and may be of especial importance to
<br>
cerebrovascular health, additional measures for stroke prevention-most
<br>
notably salt restriction-may be advisable when attempting to
<br>
down-regulate IGF-I activity as a pro-longevity strategy.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Caloric restriction has been shown to increase longevity in organisms
<br>
ranging from yeast to mammals. In some organisms, this has been
<br>
associated with a decreased fat mass and alterations in
<br>
insulin/insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) pathways. To further explore
<br>
these associations with enhanced longevity, we studied mice with a
<br>
fat-specific insulin receptor knockout  (FIRKO). These animals have
<br>
reduced fat mass and are protected against
<br>
age-related obesity and its subsequent metabolic abnormalities, although
<br>
their food intake is normal. Both male and female FIRKO mice were found
<br>
to have an increase in mean life-span of approximately 134 days (18%),
<br>
with parallel increases in median and maximum life-spans. Thus, a
<br>
reduction of fat mass without caloric restriction can be associated with
<br>
increased longevity in mice, possibly through effects on insulin signaling.

<br>
&nbsp;Dietary flaxseed inhibits human breast cancer growth and metastasis and
<br>
downregulates expression of insulin-like growth factor and epidermal
<br>
growth factor receptor.
<br>
&nbsp;Recent studies indicate that diets rich in phytoestrogens and n-3 fatty
<br>
acid have anticancer potential. This study determined the effect of
<br>
flaxseed (FS), the richest source of lignans and alpha-linolenic acid, on
<br>
growth and metastasis of established human breast cancer in a nude mice
<br>
model. Estrogen receptor-negative human breast cancer cells, MDA-MB-435,
<br>
were injected into the mammary fat pad of mice (Ncr nu/nu) fed a basal
<br>
diet (BD). At Week 8, mice were randomized into two diet groups, such
<br>
that the groups had similar tumor size and body weight. One continued on
<br>
the BD, while the other was changed to BD supplemented with 10% FS, until
<br>
sacrifice at Week 15. A significant reduction (P &lt; 0.05) in tumor growth
<br>
rate and a 45% reduction (P = 0.08) in total incidence of metastasis were
<br>
observed in the FS group. Lung metastasis incidence was 55.6% in the BD
<br>
group and 22.2% in the FS group, while the lymph node metastasis incidence
<br>
was 88.9% in the BD group and 33.3% in the FS group (P &lt; 0.05). Mean
<br>
tumor number (tumor load) of total and lymph node metastasis was
<br>
significantly lower in the FS than in the BD group (P &lt; 0.05). Metastatic
<br>
lung tumor number was reduced by 82%, and a significantly lower tumor
<br>
trend (P &lt; 0.01) was observed in the FS group. Lung weight, which also
<br>
reflects metastatic tumor load, in the FS group was reduced by 20% (P &lt;
<br>
0.05) compared with the BD group. Immunohistochemical study showed that
<br>
Ki-67 labeling index and expression of insulin-like growth factor I and
<br>
epithelial growth factor receptor in the primary tumor were lower in the
<br>
FS (P &lt; 0.05) than in the BD group. In conclusion, flaxseed inhibited the
<br>
established human breast cancer growth and metastasis in a nude mice
<br>
model, and this effect is partly due to its downregulation of
<br>
insulin-like growth factor I and epidermal growth factor receptor expression.

<br>
&nbsp;Dietary correlates of plasma insulin-like growth factor I and
<br>
insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 concentrations.
<br>
Plasma levels of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) have been
<br>
associated with risk of several cancers. Although protein-calorie
<br>
malnutrition is known to decrease IGF-I levels, few published studies
<br>
have related diet to IGF-I levels in well-nourished humans. We examined
<br>
the cross-sectional association of plasma IGF-I and IGF-binding protein 3
<br>
(IGFBP-3) levels with intakes of alcohol, energy, macronutrients,
<br>
micronutrients, and specific foods in 1037 healthy women. Adjusted mean
<br>
hormone levels across categories of dietary variables were calculated by
<br>
linear regression. Results were adjusted for non-dietary factors found to
<br>
be associated with IGF levels. Total energy intake was positively
<br>
associated with IGF-I levels when adjusted for covariates. Adjusted mean
<br>
levels of IGF-I (ng/ml) across increasing quintiles of energy intake were
<br>
181, 185, 191, 199, and 195 (P for the linear trend = 0.006). In other
<br>
multivariate analyses, energy-adjusted fat and carbohydrate intake had no
<br>
association with IGF-I levels. The most consistent finding was a positive
<br>
association between protein intake with circulating IGF-I concentration
<br>
(174, 188, 201, 192, and 196 ng/ml across quintiles of protein intake; P =
<br>
0.002), which was largely attributable to milk intake. Adjusted mean
<br>
levels of IGF-I (ng/ml) across increasing quartiles of milk intake were
<br>
183, 189, 188, and 200 (P = 0.01). Higher fat intake, in particular
<br>
saturated fat, was associated with lower levels of IGFBP-3. We conclude
<br>
that higher energy, protein, and milk intakes were associated with higher
<br>
levels of IGF-I. These associations raise the possibility that diet could
<br>
affect cancer risk through influencing IGF-I level.
