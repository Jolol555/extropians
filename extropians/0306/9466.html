Below is a famous quote from Adam Smith explaining how most people really
<br>
don't care what happens in China, much as they would like to believe
<br>
otherwise.  I wonder if people feel the same way about the future; maybe
<br>
its something they like to believe they care about, but in the end really
<br>
don't care very much.  They only talk about it to show how witty or smart
<br>
or caring they are, but not because they really care.  That might help
<br>
explain why people seem so uninterested in thinking seriously about it.
<br>
<p>------------------------------------------------------------------------
<br>
&quot;Let us suppose that the great empire of China, with all its myriads of
<br>
inhabitants, was suddenly swallowed up by an earthquake, and let us
<br>
consider how a man of humanity in Europe, who had no sort of connexion
<br>
with that part of the world, would be affected upon receiving intelligence
<br>
of this dreadful calamity. He would, I imagine, first of all, express very
<br>
strongly his sorrow for the misfortune of that unhappy people, he would
<br>
make many melancholy reflections upon the precariousness of human life,
<br>
and the vanity of all the labours of man, which could thus be annihilated
<br>
in a moment. He would too, perhaps, if he was a man of speculation, enter
<br>
into many reasonings concerning the effects which this disaster might
<br>
produce upon the commerce of Europe, and the trade and business of the
<br>
world in general.
<br>
<p>&quot;And when all this fine philosophy was over, when all these humane
<br>
sentiments had been once fairly expressed, he would pursue his business or
<br>
his pleasure, take his repose or his diversion, with the same ease and
<br>
tranquillity, as if no such accident had happened.
<br>
<p>&quot;The most frivolous disaster which could befal himself would occasion a
<br>
more real disturbance. If he was to lose his little finger to-morrow, he
<br>
would not sleep to-night; but, provided he never saw them, he will snore
<br>
with the most profound security over the ruin of a hundred millions of his
<br>
brethren, and the destruction of that immense multitude seems plainly an
<br>
object less interesting to him, than this paltry misfortune of his own.
<br>
<p>&quot;To prevent, therefore, this paltry misfortune to himself, would a man of
<br>
humanity be willing to sacrifice the lives of a hundred millions of his
<br>
brethren, provided he had never seen them? Human nature startles with
<br>
horror at the thought, and the world, in its greatest depravity and
<br>
corruption, never produced such a villain as could be capable of
<br>
entertaining it. But what makes this difference? When our passive feelings
<br>
are almost always so sordid and so selfish, how comes it that our active
<br>
principles should often be so generous and so noble? When we are always so
<br>
much more deeply affected by whatever concerns ourselves, than by whatever
<br>
concerns other men; what is it which prompts the generous, upon all
<br>
occasions, and the mean upon many, to sacrifice their own interests to the
<br>
greater interests of others?&quot;
