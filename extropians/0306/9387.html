Sac&gt; First, my feeble understanding of the modern understanding of evolution is that when Darwin said &quot;Survival of the Fitest&quot; he did not mean the strongest; he mean't the most successfully adaptive.
<br>
Sac&gt; If strong is what is needed to succeed, fine; if running or flying like a bat out of hell works well enough, so you can breed and pass along your traits. also good.
<br>
<p>Sac&gt; As for humans, I suspect that what succeeds for humans is not only academic skills, but social competition. The most agressive and assertive persons, who possess people skills and the ability to
<br>
Sac&gt; hire good speech writers and policy makers and deliver said speeches, is what these Republics we live in are all about.
<br>
<p>Sac&gt; The most intellectually gifted in astronomy, for example, are not at the exact head of the chow-line. I mean, astronomers do well enough, and love what they do, but their paychecks do not match
<br>
Sac&gt; that of Corporation CEO's (Pre-Prison income only!)
<br>
<p>Adaptation, yes, of course. This is where it is important in the human
<br>
world  to  be  multi-skilled  so that you can use all the resources at
<br>
hand to develop yourself.
<br>
<p>Money is quite an important thing at the end of the day. I do not want
<br>
to  be  restricted in my development because of lack of money. I think
<br>
that the more I use my abilities to get money, the more I will be able
<br>
to use that money to develop myself. This fits into what has been said
<br>
about  rich people reaping all the benefits of technological progress.
<br>
<p>BIL.
