</em><br>
<p>I agree our actual choices tend to be piecemeal, but unfortunately this 
<br>
mostly raises the costs of being rational.  Our natural habits of thought 
<br>
include our each believing that while most people are biased in many ways, 
<br>
we are more rational than others.  This is part of our general 
<br>
over-estimation of our ability and moral value.  Most people actually know 
<br>
about most of the standard biases that people fall for.   Literature has 
<br>
for many hundreds of years relied on this fact when making fun of such 
<br>
biases.  Most people pay sincere lip service to rationality, and we nod 
<br>
knowingly when someone mentions one of the standard biases.  But while we 
<br>
might admit in general that we are subject to the same biases, we each 
<br>
usually manage to avoid believing that a particular bias applies to us in a 
<br>
particular situation.  If it appears otherwise, we can point to particular 
<br>
factors that make this an exception.
<br>
<p>This means that in order to actually be rational, rather than just thinking 
<br>
that we are rational, we have to work rather hard to overcome our evolved 
<br>
habits of self-deception about our rationality.  As Feynman said, &quot;The 
<br>
first principle is that you must not fool yourself, and you are the easiest 
<br>
person to fool.&quot;
<br>
<p>This all must apply to me too.  I must be less rational and value 
<br>
truth-seeking less than I'm inclined to believe.  I think I try, but 
<br>
whether I really try very hard is very hard for me to judge with any accuracy.
