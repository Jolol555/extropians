<em>&gt;You'd think so, but Randi is a slippery customer, and besides his target
</em><br>
<em>&gt;seems to be those palpable frauds or self-deluded ninnies who are easily
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unmasked, dowsers who can't dowse and aura-readers who can't tell if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone's standing behind a screen although they swear they can see colorful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;auras poking over the top. Presented with a probabilistic phenomenon, his
</em><br>
<em>&gt;methods of assessment are too coarse. That would be equally true, I think,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;if he were trying to evaluate neutrino flavor shifting en route from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Sun to the Earth. `Hey, c'morn, I can't *see* these little buggers, and you

<p>Can't speak for Randi (though I suspect his motivation is much the same),
<br>
but as far as Oz Skeptics is concerned our challenge is very much directed
<br>
at charlatans who rip-off the public.  Of course they know better than to
<br>
take the challenge, so we are largely left with the well-meaning but self
<br>
deluded folk who are probably quite pleasant people at heart. I always try
<br>
to talk them out of taking on the challenge.
<br>
<p>As for people who want to study this stuff seriously at universities, they
<br>
don't bother us at all.  It's their time and they can spend it how they
<br>
like as long as their colleagues don't mind. It's not as though this is the
<br>
only pointless thing that is studied at unis these days (Business
<br>
Management springs to mind, so do assorted &quot;Alternative&quot; therapies).  We do
<br>
tend to get a bit cranky when these folk blame others (including Skeptics)
<br>
for their lack of success and that they are not taken seriously.

Randi isn't making such a 'demand'. The testee is required to specify
<br>
in advance what he/she can demonstrate and under what conditions.
<br>
Randi or his staff do not configure tests without the testee's input.
<br>
<p>Scientists claiming neutrinos are real, CAN help devise tests to
<br>
demonstrate their existence in a way that satisfies both parties and
<br>
not on some arbitrary 'meter' handed to them out of the blue.
<br>
<p>&quot;Here, show me you can make gold out of straw. Blow into this breathalyzer.&quot;
