</em><br>
<p>Uh, I think you agreed with too much here.  In particular, I think we all
<br>
agree that the vast majority of humanity believes that they are in a
<br>
situation in which the future will not be that different from the 20th
<br>
century or before.
<br>
<p>But, as Robin said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In this situation, I claim the extra effort to substantially overcome
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; our inherited biases and be more rational than we naturally would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; seems usually more effort than it is worth, given the goals
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; specified.
</em><br>
<p>On this point, it sounds as if you might be in agreement with Robin: that,
<br>
for example, it might have been a good idea (I suppose we oughtn't call it
<br>
&quot;rational&quot;) not to be avidly truth-seeking in the mid-19th century, in
<br>
light of the fact that the 20th century, despite all of its myriad
<br>
changes, would be not all THAT different from the 19th, at least in the
<br>
dimensions in which Robin is interested.
<br>
<p>But, isn't there an argument in favor of rationality that doesn't
<br>
crucially depend on the claim that there's a Singularity right round the
<br>
bend?  The arguments I've presented thus far would apply equally well to
<br>
Socrates as they do today.
<br>
<p>Is your argument for truth-seeking *merely* a special case of
<br>
Singularitarianism?  Can't we formulate an argument for rationality with
<br>
appeal to Singularitarians and others alike?  Shouldn't we, after all,
<br>
accept Singularitarianism *under* some ethical/epistemic requirement to
<br>
pursue/believe the truth, rather than accepting Singularitarianism and
<br>
then (thereby) finding a commitment to reason?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Deliberately strive for modularity?  In a consilient universe?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, if only so as to prevent your conceptual scheme from becoming an
<br>
ivory tower or walled garden.  [Or, skipping ahead just a bit, because we
<br>
need to take P(T|~B) into account.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is only ever one explanation.  In it, all the pieces fit together
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perfectly, without strain.  Any divisions in that explanation are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial - human biases.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I would not take it as a good sign if my theories about one part of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cognitive science were consonant with many possible alternatives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elsewhere; it would be a sign that the theory was inadequately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constrained by the evidence.
</em><br>
<p>As a Bayesian, this is just nonsense.  If your cog-sci theory is T and
<br>
your background theory is B, P(T) is higher, all else being equal, if
<br>
P(T|~B) is higher, not lower, no matter how high you think the odds of B
<br>
are.
<br>
<p>Putting that another way: Remember, all the logical facts (which are
<br>
utterly &quot;unconstrained&quot; by the evidence) are true regardless of
<br>
&quot;alternative&quot; background theories, yet they are the most certain of all of
<br>
our beliefs.  They're &quot;bad&quot; science, I suppose, but they make for great
<br>
beliefs!
<br>
<p>Being consistent with alternate explanations makes a belief *better*, not
<br>
*worse*.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I certainly wouldn't deliberately alter the theory to make it consistent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with more than one alternative elsewhere.
</em><br>
<p>That's a pity, because, all else being equal, you'd have a more likely
<br>
theory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nature doesn't work that way in constructing explanations; how could it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a good method for discovering them?
</em><br>
<p>My first response: &quot;I would least expect to get this kind of argument
<br>
HERE, of all places!  Isn't it rather the point that we can do a bit
<br>
better than nature?&quot;
<br>
<p>But let me put that a better way: You say that nature just *picks* its one
<br>
explanation.  Fine: so the probability of everything being just-so in
<br>
light of everything being the way it is, from *nature's* point of view, is
<br>
1.  That's all fine and dandy, but what you're saying is that *nature
<br>
isn't being a Bayesian*.
<br>
<p>But we know better, don't we?  We form our believes in a Bayesian way, not
<br>
because the world is Bayesian, (as you rightly point out, it just picks
<br>
possibilities and locks their probabilities to 1; it has no priors to
<br>
adjust) but because Bayes is the best way we have of getting *our beliefs*
<br>
to *look* like the world.
<br>
<p>[In fact, I think you won't like this conclusion at all: if you were to
<br>
give up on anything, I'd expect you to give up on the notion that nature
<br>
is non-Bayesian.  But, of course, in that case, it's all the more
<br>
important to ensure that your beliefs rank well, which means taking
<br>
P(T|~B) into account.]
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Your first priority should be to discover what the real answer is about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the usefulness of rationality.  When you know the real answer, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worry about how to explain it - constructing an accessible explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can you do both at the same time without biasing your conclusions?
</em><br>
<p>You can't help but do both at the same time.  And our conclusions are
<br>
&quot;biased...&quot; by our priors!  It's a feature.
