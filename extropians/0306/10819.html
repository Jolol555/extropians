<em>&gt;Why the quotation marks? You're saying if I sell a can of peas with a

</em><br>
<p>You are right. I'm advocating for more information for the consumer, using
<br>
government force. Maybe in a libertarian world it would be handled
<br>
differently. Now, in Europe and US, it seems to me the only way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt;is to prevent a bigger, messier sequence of events: companies
</em><br>
<em>&gt;selling
</em><br>
<em>&gt;foods without labels,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's really not that complicated, if you don't like food without labels
</em><br>
<em>&gt;then don't buy food without labels.
</em><br>
<p>You seem to stumble on a contradiction here: on one hand, you think
<br>
that people protesting GM are protesting the wrong thing (because they are
<br>
not informed, stupid, etc). On the other hand, you trust their judgment in
<br>
buying the right things...  What i think is that, without proper
<br>
information, people often make the WRONG choice. And what's worse, they
<br>
often have no way to know that they did.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt;people (as it was  suggested) setting up labs for analyzing food and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;publishing reports
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What's wrong with that?
</em><br>
<p>Nothing, but it just feels wasteful to go to such great lengths just to
<br>
see if that red fluid in a bottle is orange juice or colored water.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt; companies suing those labs for misleading information,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;What's wrong with that? Fraud should be punished and I don't see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt;mandatory labeling laws will lead to less fraud or fewer lawsuits.
</em><br>
<p>That was worded wrongly. What I meant to say is &quot;companies suing those
<br>
labs not to make public that information&quot;, and it seems to me a very
<br>
possible outcome.
<br>
<p>And to answer your statement, I think that mandatory labeling would
<br>
actually lead to less fraud and lawsuits. It's one thing to sell something
<br>
without revealing its composition. It's another thing to deliberately lie
<br>
on the food label. One would think twice before doing that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;And would one of those &quot;other ways&quot; be the astrological sign of the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt;who grew the food along with the GM information? After all, millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people are interested in astrology, far more than in modern genetics, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt;don't see many molecular biology columns in the tabloids but every one of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them will tell you what will happen when the house of Mars is in Uranus.
</em><br>
<p>Hey, I work in an astronomical observatory. You don't need to lesson me on
<br>
astrology :-))
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Protesting something that has never hurt anyone is time and effort spent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that could have been used to save many thousands, it's a classic case of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;misplaced priorities.
</em><br>
<p>And who are you to tell people what they should protest? If the free
<br>
market of ideas brings billions of $ to football players and nothing to
<br>
cryonics research, well, that's just free market at work. Judging from
<br>
what I read in your post, you should approve those choices.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt; Some years ago, Europe was shocked by the &quot;mad cow&quot; disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;And mad cow disease had nothing to due with GM foods.
</em><br>
<p>I'm talking about proper food labelling in general, not just GM. The mad
<br>
cow incident resulted in better food labelling, and better information for
<br>
the consumer. Let's see if the GM war brings along something similar.
<br>
<p>Ciao,
<br>
