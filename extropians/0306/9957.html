</em><br>
<p>I am concerned about the use of &quot;in other words...&quot; on the Extropians list.
<br>
What is the purpose of this, and is this purpose valid?  It seems that it is
<br>
usually used to rephrase an opponent's position before attacking it.  This
<br>
is very risky because it often results in a straw man.  Why is it necessary
<br>
to rephrase the opponent's words before attacking them?  Why can't the
<br>
original and actual words be refuted directly?  Is it ever valid to reword
<br>
an opponent's statement and then attack your own rewording instead of what
<br>
the opponent really said?  It seems to me that this is misleading at best
<br>
and dishonest at worse.  I think it is an emotional jab at the opponent, but
<br>
not valid in a rational debate.
<br>
<p>Reality check here, John:
<br>
Do you literally parse John's words as proposing that America should
<br>
rollover, play dead, and wait for next 911?  Do you really expect Hubert to
<br>
agree with your reading of what he said?  If not, do you really think this
<br>
is Hubert's hidden agenda that you have exposed?
<br>
<p>I am seriously asking what you think you have accomplished here?  Did you
<br>
think you refuted Hubert's statements, made Hubert's position clearer, made
<br>
your position clearer, exposed Hubert's unstated position, or what?  Unless
<br>
this was just an emotional backlash that was not intended to have any
<br>
rational content, your logic escapes me.
