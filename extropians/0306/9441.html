<br>
as &quot;attacking the US&quot;. (I'm assuming that this Bernard is American, as it 
<br>
seems).
<br>
<p>Alfio,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It seems simple enough to me.  In 1776 we formed a country called the 
<br>
United States of America.  A bit later we adopted a constitution to govern the 
<br>
US.  We have governed this country under our Declaration of Independence and 
<br>
under the procedures set forth in our Constitution for something over 200 
<br>
years.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under that Constitution we have a government presently ruling 
<br>
according to our laws.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is room for debate under our system.  There is also a definition 
<br>
of treason.  In between those two bookends there is an area where an 
<br>
individual or a group is no longer being constructive.  In fact they are being 
<br>
destructive but have not risen to the level of treason.  I am saying that in my 
<br>
judgment they are attacking our country and being destructive but not treasonous.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just as other's comments are allowed under our system so are mine.
<br>
Be good,
<br>
Ron h.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
