<em>&gt;&gt; It seems to me that whatever economic pressure exists towards
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; standardizing on verifiable mental architectures will apply
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; much more towards standardizing on motivations. A group of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; agents with the same mental architecture and different
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; motivations faces huge disadvantages when competing with a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; group of agents with a variety of mental architectures and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the same motivations. The latter group can optimize their
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; mental architectures for efficiency and specialization,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rather than verifiability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think your mention of groups is quite interesting here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It does indeed seem likely that we'll see different groups with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different mental architectures.  That raises the possibility that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency across groups will be much more difficult than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency within those groups.[*]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And transparency within those groups will depend upon the details of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mental architecture.  While there are advantages afforded to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups that are able to achieve a high degree of transparency, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also likely disadvantages resulting from the design overhead
</em><br>
<em>&gt; necessary to ensure that transparency.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The disadvantages accrue to both solo individuals and to members of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the group.  The advantages accrue only when multiple individuals are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cooperating.  The advantages of transparency are likely greater for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; groups whose members cooperate more fully.  This suggests an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evolutionary feedback loop - as a group achieves a level of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency it can achieve a level of greater cooperation which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; encourages an even greater level of transparency, etc...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So one wonders if entities which are truly able to achieve mental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transparency end up on a path towards merger into composite entities,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whereas entities that are less able to achieve transparency remain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more individual, and are perhaps pushed towards ecological niches
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where they can take advantage of the freedom their individuality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affords them to rapidly experiment with new mental designs without the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; burden of transparency protocols and such which would otherwise limit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them.
</em><br>
<p>### Again, the Golden Oekumene gives an example - Neptunians, living a
<br>
hardscrabble life on the peripheries of the Solar System, with mental
<br>
architectures somewhat different from the participants in the mentality, and
<br>
perhaps more likely to be involved in shady dealings.
<br>
<p>The fully transparent entities do not need to be composites, or mergers of
<br>
entities (although they could, such as the Eleemosynary and Bellipotent
<br>
Compositions). Even having a fully standardized operating system doesn't
<br>
mean you are one and the same as the other users of the system. As long as
<br>
you have mental modules with unique data, you are a unique individual.
<br>
<p>When talking about standardization and uniqueness of mental architectures,
<br>
it's also important to ask about the copyright and other elements of IP.
<br>
Will specific architectures be owned by their users (from the principle of
<br>
self-ownership), or will they be owned by their designers? Will a person
<br>
assuming a certain architecture without the copyright owner's permission be
<br>
forced to pay restitution, or re-form itself back to its original mental
<br>
shape? It's worth noting that in the world of full transparency information
<br>
is no longer different from real property in terms of enforceability and
<br>
verifiability of contracts - it can be sold, and its theft can be prevented
<br>
just as in the case of apples. Therefore, thanks to improved verifiability,
<br>
an independent derivation of the same invention, mathematical formula, etc.,
<br>
can be treated just as the independent growing of another apple, eliminating
<br>
the element of monopoly inherent in the IP of today. If there is no
<br>
monopoly, there is no need for limitations on the duration of copyright
<br>
protection (just as in &quot;The Golden Age&quot;).
<br>
<p>The number of ideas that John Wright got right in his books, is simply
<br>
amazing.
<br>
---------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; * - The notion of groups who are able to achieve high degrees of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; internal transparency but are unable to achieve transparency with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members of other groups is actually rather disturbing.  It suggests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possibility of more deeply embedded tribalism among diverse future
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities, with all the ills that tribalism brings.
</em><br>
<p>### Wouldn't you call it rather &quot;speciation&quot;?
