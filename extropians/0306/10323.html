<p><em>&gt; Thanks!  But it's not just me.  Amara, Damiaen, Eliezer, Emlyn, Hubert,

<em>&gt; James, Jeff, Mez, Olga, Samantha and I have all been recently accused of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow supporting the enemy.  These baseless personal attacks seem to be a
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; These are our friends being accused of war crimes.  This is excessive.  What
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is going on here?
</em><br>
<p>It's important when dealing with emotional issues to stick to the facts.
<br>
We all agree that making false accusations is wrong.
<br>
<p>I have examined the list archives for the past year closely, searching
<br>
for the phrase &quot;war crime&quot; or &quot;war crimes&quot;.  Not once did I find anyone
<br>
use that term to apply to a contributor to this list.  No one on this
<br>
mailing list has been accused of war crimes!
<br>
<p>The only discussion of war crimes has been in the context of actions
<br>
on the part of the governments of the United States and its allies and
<br>
its enemies, in the first and second Gulf Wars and in World War II.
<br>
There has been debate about whether the U.S. actions in Iraq were war
<br>
crimes, whether Saddam and his generals commited war crimes, whether
<br>
the bombings of Dresden and Hiroshima were war crimes, etc.
<br>
<p>The first mention of war crimes outside this context was by Harvey himself:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The world isn't binary!  These faulty deductions are wasting a lot of time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and driving a lot of people away with baseless accusations.  A lack of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complaint does not prove support.  Pointing out flaws in one side does not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mean someone is on the other side.  Disliking our current President is not a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war crime.  We have enough differences of opinion.  We don't need to project
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further ones where they do not really exist.
</em><br>
<p>Harvey has gone from saying that &quot;disliking our current President is
<br>
not a war crime&quot; to the claim that &quot;our friends [are] being accused of
<br>
war crimes&quot;.  I believe that he has remembered the dialog incorrectly
<br>
and has put his own words into the mouths of others.
<br>
<p>I would encourage everyone to try not to overstate and inflame the
<br>
situation.  If you want to make a complaint about excessive rhetoric,
<br>
quote the words in question rather than trying to paraphrase them or
<br>
offering a general characterization of the tone.  The latter practices
<br>
are far more fraught with error than most people realize.
<br>
<p>Hal
