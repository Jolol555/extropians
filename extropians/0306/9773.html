</em><br>
<p>First, I don't know what this has to do with the Luddites mentioned
<br>
in the subject header.
<br>
<p>Second, the &quot;former brain&quot; in question, Justin Frankel, had (at last
<br>
notice) *threatened* to leave, but has not actually quit, as far as
<br>
has been publicly reported.  Read the slashdot discussion closely at
<br>
<a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/06/04/169214">http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=03/06/04/169214</a>, or Frankel's blog
<br>
at <a href="http://www.1014.org/">http://www.1014.org/</a>.
<br>
<p>Third, the legality of the WASTE package is under question, as AOL, which
<br>
owns NullSoft and hence the software, claimed that Frankel planted the
<br>
GPL license on WASTE without authorization, and that in fact the license
<br>
is not valid and the software was released without permission.
<br>
<p>And fourth, although I have not inspected the crypto, some cypherpunks
<br>
did, and the consensus was that it is not very good.  This is from Eric
<br>
Rescorla on Perry Metzger's cryptography list:
<br>
<p>: It's utterly baffling to me why people like this choose to design
<br>
: their own thing rather than just using SSL. I've looked through their
<br>
: design documents and glanced at their code they don't provide any
<br>
: security features that SSL doesn't, and they appear to have made a
<br>
: number of questionable design decisions:
<br>
:
<br>
: (0) Their messages don't appear have any sequence numbers, making them
<br>
:     potentially open to a wide variety of integrity attacks. They have some sort
<br>
:     of guid but unless you intend to keep a record of all guids through
<br>
:     a session (horrible) this is only a partial fix for replay and 
<br>
:     not a fix at all for removal.
<br>
: (1) They use MD5 instead of HMAC for message authentication. Scary.
<br>
: (2) They use the same encryption keys in both directions. At least
<br>
:     they have the sense to run separate PCBC counters. However,
<br>
:     based on the code it doesn't look like they reset the PCBC
<br>
:     counters after a bad message is received so you may be able to
<br>
:     mount a reflection attack.
<br>
: (3) They use Blowfish (why not AES?) in PCBC mode (huh?)
<br>
:
<br>
: I don't think it's worth much time analyzing this... Just one
<br>
: more case of NIH.
<br>
