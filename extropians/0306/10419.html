<br>
someone accuses somebody of one of these and has evidence to support that, even a 
<br>
'tiny kernel', what then?
<br>
<p>Michael,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were responding to Harvey's statement, &quot;Wrong.  When someone is 
<br>
accused of being supporting communism, terrorism, or the enemy without any 
<br>
evidence,that is slander.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can understand that to call someone a Republican, Libertarian or 
<br>
Democrat you probably have some reason or evidence for saying so.  But if you are 
<br>
wrong there is no great harm done.  If you mislabel a person a very small 
<br>
percentage of people will rise to the occasion and set you straight but no one 
<br>
would call it slanderous.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As to the &quot;terrorism or the enemy&quot; part, they are proud to have it 
<br>
known they are our enemy and terrorists to boot, except, of course when they are 
<br>
in the US bent on a mission.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But calling someone a Communist is slanderous?  That puzzles me.  
<br>
Every time I go to vote there are communists running for office.  Why is calling 
<br>
someone a Communist even thought of as slander by some?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work at various odd jobs for the Republican Party during election 
<br>
periods.  If folks choose to call me a Republican then that is justifiable.  
<br>
When folks ask me I openly state that I am a small ell libertarian that votes 
<br>
Republican and that my goal is to defeat all Democrats while pushing the 
<br>
Republicans more and more libertarian in its views.  All of my political co-workers 
<br>
that care to remember have heard me say that from time to time.  They have heard 
<br>
me advocate libertarian positions in discussion.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contrast that with the reaction of an American Communist called a 
<br>
communist -- &quot;that is slander.&quot;  Heaven forbid that such children ever get power 
<br>
in either the Extropian movement or in our country.
<br>
