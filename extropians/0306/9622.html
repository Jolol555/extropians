<em>&gt;  &gt;Let's leave Indonesia out of it.
</em><br>
<p>John Clark said
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No. If you're correct and their intense mind numbing rage is caused by ill
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treatment by the west and is not intrinsic to their dogma then you need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explain why Indonesian Muslims hate the west every bit as much as Arab
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Muslims do. No doubt if you're skillful with Google you'll be able to find
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some little two bit massacre of Indonesians a century or two ago but
</em><br>
you'll
<br>
<em>&gt; have to do better than that. The one thing the two groups have in common
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is their religion and I don't think it's unreasonable to draw a conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from that.
</em><br>
<p>I broadly agree with much of your argument John but I do think Indonesia is
<br>
the interesting exception. From what I read and know personally I would say
<br>
that while there is a fair amount of anti-American feeling in Indonesia it's
<br>
nothing like as intense as it is in the Middle East (it's the Dutch they
<br>
still have it in for plus the Chinese). The Islamic fundamentalists in
<br>
Indonesia who were responsible for the Bali bombing come overwhelmingly from
<br>
the very small Arabic speaking minority in Java and Sumatra. Although the
<br>
Wahabi propaganda has been doing damage there just as in the rest of the
<br>
Islamic world it isn't anything like as bad as it is in, say, Pakistan. I
<br>
would tentatively conclude that it isn't so much Islam as &quot;Islam in the
<br>
Middle East/Pakistan&quot; that is the problem. That part of the world does have
<br>
certain features that would lead any observer to predict trouble such as a
<br>
very high birthrate, lots of educated but unemployed young men and a
<br>
buggered up economy. Not to mention a family system that makes a stable
<br>
political system difficult to sustain - something that doesn't apply in
<br>
Indonesia, except among the minority I mentioned earlier. Steve DaviesDavies
