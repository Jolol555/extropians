Damien replies:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was Damien who chose to use the phrase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;oily omelette&quot; in his harsh response to Spike...
</em><br>
Oy vey!  For the record, I did not consider Damien's response harsh or
<br>
critical.  I have been away for a few days, so do forgive if this topic
<br>
is stale.
<br>
I would offer the following scenario to explain the lack of battle
<br>
footage shown in the USian news.
<br>
The newspeople were sent in with the coalition troops knowing that a
<br>
Pulitzer Prize, untold riches and 72 virgins awaited the first of them
<br>
to come home with any real footage of actual battle.  Their universal
<br>
failure was due to the fact that the Coalition newspeople and the
<br>
Coalition troops were not present at the major battles of this conflict.
<br>
This is not to say there were not battles, but rather that most of the
<br>
shooting was between the Iraqis and the non-Iraqi Muslim zealots.  
<br>
The zealots, you will recall, came from countries all over the middle
<br>
east to help defend Iraq from the invading coalition.  The day before
<br>
the battle of the Airport, you may recall seeing an interview with an
<br>
American general.  In the distance a fierce firefight broke out.  He
<br>
commented that he did not know who was engaging whom, since all the
<br>
coalition forces were accounted for and quiet at that moment.
<br>
My notion is that a few days before, a group of zealots led the Iraqis
<br>
into battle, only to have the Iraqis shoot them in the back.  The
<br>
zealots, wanting to avoid a repeat of this debacle, decided to go thru
<br>
the Iraqi ranks and shoot any soldiers that might present a threat from
<br>
the rear.  The Iraqis, understandably incensed at this action, decided
<br>
to shoot back.  There was no footage because neither the Iraqis nor the
<br>
zealots had embedded reporters.  I expect the full story to leak out in
<br>
the coming years.
<br>
So, to more accurately state my earlier comment that there was never any
<br>
war, I would now say the war mostly did not involve the coalition.  In
<br>
general, the Iraqis had no issue with the Coalition troops, and the
<br>
Coalition troops had no issue with the Iraqi troops.  The American
<br>
soldiers mostly just wanted to get home to their children and husbands.
<br>
This would also explain the presence of cluster bombs, when the
<br>
coalition generals claim they didn't fire them.  Cluster bombs were set
<br>
in place by the zealots, who were hoping to punish the Iraqis for not
<br>
fighting, and to cause antipathy towards the coalition, perhaps
<br>
encouraging the Iraqis to fight.  This scenario explains a lot of
<br>
puzzling apparent contradictions, does it not?
