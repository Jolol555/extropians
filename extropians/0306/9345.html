<em>&gt; Now that, I think this list can do.  C'mon, everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any ideas for pieces of TransHumanity, Inc. that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could start up today for, say, under US$10 million?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [snip]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any killer apps for wearable computers/augmented
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality nearing marketability?  (Facial recognition
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't count yet: among other things, you'd need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the error rate way down before the market would go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for it, or so say the studies I've seen.)
</em><br>
<p>Here's a really basic one.
<br>
<p>Networked mobile computing devices (wearables, palm type PDAs, souped up
<br>
mobiles hooked on G3, wireless networked laptops) seem to be missing a
<br>
killer app to really drive the sector. Having google on your telephone is
<br>
nice, but if you're not a tech geek, is it reason enough?
<br>
<p>For people to carry a new expensive gadget around with them (a pocket sized
<br>
computer fitting any of the descriptions above that has always-on internet
<br>
access), they will need a compelling use (like mobile phones came with -
<br>
always having a phone with you).
<br>
<p>It strikes me that the technologies that help people fit tighter into
<br>
networks - business and personal - are the ones that people will adopt
<br>
quickly. But they've already got phones, including SMS, mobile email
<br>
sometimes... what else would they need?
<br>
<p>It strikes me that SMS and phone (and email in the same class as SMS) is
<br>
very unsophisticated tool given what it is used for. I contend that people
<br>
use these communication tools primarily to coordinate interaction with other
<br>
people... getting together, going out, coordinating arrival times... many
<br>
variations on the theme of meeting.
<br>
<p>In the corporate world that I've been inhabiting for far too much of my
<br>
adult life, people do this with more sophisticated tools, especially
<br>
in-house. Primarily they use the schedule in MS Outlook, which allows them
<br>
to arrange meetings, browse other people's schedules, and basically fit in
<br>
better and more easily with other people's agendas and schedules.
<br>
<p>But there's a wall at the edge of the corporation. You can't get to the
<br>
schedules of people outside, and even if you could, people outside a corp
<br>
might usually be wandering around somewhere. 
<br>
<p>Automated schedules with reminders for yourself and ways for arranging
<br>
meetings with others are limited by being internal to organisations, and
<br>
being desk (desktop) bound.
<br>
<p>Enter the Mobile Wireless PC (be it PDA, mobile phone, wearable, whatever).
<br>
Add the internet. Stir.
<br>
<p>HotSchedule
<br>
What is called for is a globally available (internet, and possibly web
<br>
delivered) scheduling system; it would be to scheduling what hotmail is to
<br>
memos. It would cater for all the mobile devices, and provide all the kinds
<br>
of services that Outlook provides; reminders, scheduling personal items,
<br>
arranging meetings with others based on their schedule, without having to
<br>
actually interact with the others involved. It could extend to all kinds of
<br>
workflow style applications, but roaming. 
<br>
<p>If we imagine a world where people had taken to HotSchedule en-masse...
<br>
Personal use: People would be arranging to meet via this tool. &quot;Locations&quot;
<br>
(ie: public areas, restaurants and cafes, bars, etc) would register with
<br>
HotSchedule, and commercial &quot;locations&quot; might vie to be a local meeting
<br>
place of choice by offering special deals to those who organised their
<br>
meeting through HotSchedule. People would be able to set up security so that
<br>
people they trust could schedule their time and see the more intimate
<br>
details of their schedule, whilst hiding these from outsiders, or only
<br>
giving them a rough overview. The potential for young people especially (who
<br>
love something as braindead as SMS) to adopt this big time are huge, imo.
<br>
Business use: Businesses like doctors, accountants, lawyers, anywhere where
<br>
you arrange an appointment, could use HotSchedule as a web booking system.
<br>
People could then arrange their own appointments without needing to interact
<br>
with administrative staff.
<br>
<p>I'm sure there's lot more... let your imagination run away with you.
<br>
<p>How does it take off? I'm pretty fuzzy on this; basically, you'd need to get
<br>
accepted by social groups a bit at a time. Phone companies could sell it as
<br>
a feature of newer devices. Hopefully it would be hugely attractive to
<br>
twenty-somethings, as a start.
<br>
<p>Why is it extropic?
<br>
I see this as being a killer app for mobile networked computing. And that
<br>
field really needs a killer app... so far the early devices look like toys
<br>
for overpaid geeks. But we can all see, I think, the massive potential
<br>
social benefit, and the amazing opportunities that would present themselves,
<br>
if everyone was hooked up to the 'net all the time, wherever they happened
<br>
to be. That kind of network deserves to be an extropic goal, and this idea
<br>
is one way to bring that situation into being. Once people adopt these
<br>
devices en-masse, the new possibilities will make it strongly
<br>
self-sustaining, analogous to the way that SMS and web features now sell
<br>
phones that could never have been built solely for the purpose of those
<br>
features (phone calls were the killer app). 
<br>
<p>This is way too long already. But there's my most recent idea.
<br>

<br>
(btw I know the name HotSchedule sucks. It's meant to invoke the analogy,
<br>
not to be a permanent name)
