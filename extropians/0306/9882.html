<em>&gt; &gt; In a message dated 6/11/2003 3:47:33 AM Central Standard Time,

<em>&gt; &gt; <a href="mailto:amara@amara.com?Subject=Re:%20META:%20%20Dishonest%20debate%20(was%20&quot;cluster%20bombs&quot;)">amara@amara.com</a> quotes: Amara, Have you noticed we haven't carpet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; bombed Iraq with cluster bombs.  Cluster bombs like any other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; weapon are intended for specific targets.  We haven't had those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; targets and hence have not used the weapons. You've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; listening to the Hate America First crowd again. Ron h.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Amara,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;        And you are still listening to that crowd.  Did you notice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I used the term &quot;carpet bombing?&quot;  In other words there had not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been any mass use of cluster bombs.  I gather from reading the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; article you enclosed that you know that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  The use of those bombs was very limited.
</em><br>
<p>Harvey replied:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ron, your original claim quoted above was that &quot;We haven't had those targets
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and hence have not used the weapons.&quot;  Amara proved you wrong.  It is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misleading to reinterpret your original claim to say that &quot;The use of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bombs was very limited.&quot;  This is not what you said.  It is dishonest to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blame Amara for this misunderstanding when it is you who changed positions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; after the evidence was presented.
</em><br>
<p>Actually I think Ron's comment can be interpreted either way.  Certainly,
<br>
if you take the claim out of context, he says that no cluster bombs
<br>
were used.  However, if you look at the whole paragraph, he first states
<br>
that &quot;we haven't carpet bombed Iraq with cluster bombs.&quot;  When he went
<br>
on to say that we &quot;have not used the weapons&quot;,  we should interpret the
<br>
second comment in the context of the first, so that he was referring to
<br>
&quot;carpet bombing with cluster bombs&quot; when he said that those weapons had
<br>
not been used.
<br>
<p>It is common in discussions to make one's claim explicitly at the
<br>
beginning, and then to refer to it in shorthand form later in the
<br>
discussion, without listing all the caveats and limitations every time.
<br>
That's what I think Ron was doing here.
<br>
<p>Therefore I disagree that he was being dishonest to claim that he was
<br>
referring to cluster bombing all along, although I can see how Harvey
<br>
might have misread his comments in that way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Secondly, your repeated ad hominem against Amara violates the list rules and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should stop.  There is no evidence that Amara hates America or listens to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those who do.  Your level of emotion and insult is out of proportion to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Amara's calm and rational style.  You are adding unnecessary heat and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion into the debate.  Whether you agree with me or not, this is in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list rules that you agreed to follow when you joined the list.
</em><br>
<p>This I do agree with.  There has been far too much name calling on this list.
<br>
<p>I would also suggest that Harvey should not be so quick to claim that
<br>
another poster is dishonest.  We should try to read each person's message
<br>
charitably, in the most favorable possible light, and look for valid
<br>
interpretations before leaping to accusations of dishonesty and the like.
<br>
Calling someone dishonest is a serious charge, worse than saying they
<br>
listen to those who hate America.
