</em><br>
<em>&gt; I suspect you, just as everyone else, will simply refuse to answer this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; question, you will refuse because it would force you to acknowledge that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam had no right to be a dictator and that he is morally culpable for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every death that resulted from the coalitions efforts and not the coalition,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which it seems, above all else, must be wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .....................&gt; Lots of snip
</em><br>
<p>I  will quite happily answer that. 
<br>
&quot;Does anyone have a right to be a dictator?&quot; The clear and simple answer is 
<br>
no. I would agree completely that &quot;Saddam had no right to be a dictator&quot; but as 
<br>
for him &quot;being culpable for every death that resulted from the coalitions 
<br>
efforts&quot; I could not disagree more. 
<br>
The actions which Saddam has taken in the past make him culpable for any and 
<br>
all deaths that have occurred by his actions. The deaths that occurred because 
<br>
we intervened are purely down to us and is on our conscience.
<br>
We must take responsibility for our actions and be prepared to lay blame for 
<br>
the death of our servicemen at our own feet. 
<br>
We are each responsible for the choices we make and the actions we take. 
<br>
Pointing the finger at someone else and saying &quot;You made me do it&quot; or &quot;Its your 
<br>
fault because if it wasn't for you we wouldn't be here&quot; is just plain bullshit. 
<br>
Even if our actions are good in intention, when someone gets hurt as a result, 
<br>
we are still responsible.
<br>
<p>As someone that has been avidly against the war from the outset. It pains me 
<br>
to think that some families of coalition troops have lost their loved ones. It 
<br>
also pains me that so many Iraqi families has also suffered due to Saddams 
<br>
regime and our actions against Saddams regime.
<br>
I agree fully that Saddam and his regime 'HAD' to be removed, I simply 
<br>
disagree with the politically and economically tainted method we chose to do it. 
<br>
At the end of the day, Saddam is gone (yippee) and we lost some troops. That 
<br>
is the price we have paid for the removal of an 'evil' regime and hopefully a 
<br>
brighter future.
<br>
<p>Was the war Extropic?  Really only time will be able to answer that question.
<br>
