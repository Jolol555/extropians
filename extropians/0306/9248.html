<p>
Pretty good summary, with a few glitches. The conjecture that Hawking is a
<br>
theist, for example, is simply mistaken, as Hawking has made clear a number
<br>
of times since his book was published. 
<br>
<p>However, this summary fits well with my own extensive reading in the field:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;As he discovered one flawed description after another, Child finally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;concluded that the books he reviewed contained &quot;nearly incredible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;falsification of the facts about the experiments.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>The misleading summaries of parapsychological results that are found in
<br>
almost all accredited psych books are simply astonishing and depressing to
<br>
anyone who has taken the trouble to go to the original experiments and work
<br>
through them. It's like reading creation science accounts of the `supposed'
<br>
evidence for `so-called' evolution--except, of course, that there is as yet
<br>
no powerful theory of psi accepted by parapsychologists, and the results
<br>
are always more ambiguous than those of most well-established sciences. I
<br>
have friends and acquaintances who are working toward a more satisfactory
<br>
account of those strange anomalies that Ray Hyman (cited in this essay)
<br>
agrees are real, even though he doesn't accept that they are paranormal.
<br>
Stay tuned.
<br>
<p>I can feel another book coming on...
<br>
