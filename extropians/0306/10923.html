</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; no contradiction or compromise is this conclusion.  People end up arguing
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective reality or even theoretical reality.  As you say, they are talking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past each other.
</em><br>
<p>I agree with this in part, but not completely.
<br>
<p>That is, I agree that fundamentally the issue is a matter of semantics.
<br>
There is no actual &quot;right&quot; or &quot;wrong&quot; about whether you are the same
<br>
as your upload, or your cryonic revivee.  I described the question as
<br>
meaningless, because the answer changes depending on what definitions
<br>
you use, just as Harvey describes.
<br>
<p>However, I disagree that this implies that the debate is pointless.
<br>
The fact is, I think that many people disagree that this is just a
<br>
semantic argument.  They believe that there is truly a fact of the
<br>
matter about whether two instances are &quot;the same&quot;.  They see it as a
<br>
matter of fundamental truth whether one consciousness is a continuation
<br>
of another, independent of any definitions or semantic arguments.
<br>
They may have difficulty in putting the question into words, but they are
<br>
convinced that being uploaded or suspended potentially matters and makes
<br>
a difference in terms of whether they have survived.
<br>
<p>I see the debate as between those who agree with Harvey that it is all
<br>
a matter of semantics (and I am one of them), and those who see it as
<br>
much more significant, with an underlying, important factual issue about
<br>
survival that must be resolved.  It seems difficult to convincingly
<br>
justify the intuition in either case.
