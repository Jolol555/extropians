I ask the question relevant to this subject further down (scroll past tired

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You said in response to Max Plumm:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Max Plumm said, amongst other things...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot; This is even more appalling when one considers that every 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilian life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lost in Iraq could've been saved had Saddam Hussein simply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relinquished
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power by the time of the U.S. imposed deadline. &quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is the second time you've said this in the last day or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two. You don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also say &quot;This is even more appalling when one considers that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every civilian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life lost in Iraq could've been saved had the coalition of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the willing not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacked in the first place.&quot; Why not?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Emlyn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To which I responded:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He probably didnt say that because it is completely absurd.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Not true. No war, no war casualties. I will grant you that people may have
<br>
died by the actions of their government, somewhat counteracting the
<br>
difference between war and peace (slightly).
<br>
<p>Remember, though, that you must also count the rioting and general civilian
<br>
disturbance that has followed the war, and all the casualties incurred
<br>
there, as part of the toll of the war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is difficult for me to even began to coalesce the reasons 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statement is repulsive to me as an extropian and an person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who values human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life.  
</em><br>
<p>Come on, that's a bit strong. The statement wasn't supposed to support or
<br>
oppose the war itself; I was attempting to point out that there are two
<br>
sides to the coin of who is responsible for deaths in Iraq. I really have to
<br>
strongly object to the idea that an aggressive, invading power bears no
<br>
responsibility for the deaths; it *always* does. Sometimes that cost is
<br>
warranted, as it may well yet turn out to be in this case. However, it is
<br>
unescapable that when you attack a sovereign country and kill its citizens,
<br>
you bear the responsibility for those deaths. Anyone is allowed self
<br>
defense.
<br>
<p>As far as &quot;as an extropian&quot; goes, I am quite unconvinced that you have
<br>
evaluated this war action using the tools of an extropian. Is state
<br>
aggression dynamist? Does it enhance liberty? Is it constructive, does it
<br>
advance our knowledge of ourselves or the universe? Is it rational (in the
<br>
worst realpolitik sense perhaps). War, as a tool, is possibly one of the
<br>
least extropic choices that you can make. It is statist, it interferes with
<br>
liberty, it destroys with abandon. This is not to say that I think war is
<br>
always unquestionably wrong. It is that war is the tool of last resort, even
<br>
then to be questioned, and the aggressor must always carry the stain of the
<br>
inevitable blood on its collective hands.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Regardless of your opposition to the Iraq war, had the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalition been simple to remove Saddam just because they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wanted to, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would have *still* had more moral validity than a murderous dictator
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remaining in power, simply because he was a murderous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictator.  Dictators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have *no right* to be dictators!
</em><br>
<p>It may very well have had more moral validity, but you are comparing two
<br>
negative numbers of great magnitude.
<br>
<p>Let me pose a different question:
<br>
A little googling (not all that much, so I could be mistaken) tells me that
<br>
the Iraq war has/will cost the US government (ie: the US people) between
<br>
US$100 and US$200 billion. That's a lot of money.
<br>
<p>You can look at a figure like that as an extropic potential. The US has
<br>
spent US$200 billion in extropic potential in waging this war. Forgetting
<br>
questions of moral validity, etc etc, I would ask the list this:
<br>
<p>Given the choice, what would you rank as the most extropic way to expend
<br>
US$200 billion? 
<br>
<p>I might post a response to this myself; I'll have to think on it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Every single person who died in the coalition war did so ONLY 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not want to give up his control over the 20 million or so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraq.
</em><br>
<p>That's not correct. Choices were made on both sides, and certainly each side
<br>
carries a moral burden (assuming some consistent set of rules). The
<br>
agressors hands can never be clean.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Please explain to me your ethical principles that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place his choice in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this conflict of staying in power and opposing the coalition 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally valid catagory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I simply can not fathom how any extropian can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider Saddam's actions in this situation as morally valid. 
</em><br>
<p>I don't defend Saddam Hussein. I defend neither side - big negative numbers.
<br>
There's no necessity to hand out black and white hats; the world is not
<br>
boolean (unless we are in a sim :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Given his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; past track record of murder, future likely hood of murder, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; track record of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wars and aggressiveness, systematic effort to wipe out the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; kurds, slaughter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of some 50,000 shiites, suspicions of harboring WMD, economic control
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resulting in the untolds thousands of deaths, etc. etc I can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not even began
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to understand how you place the moral culpability of those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deaths on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people attempting to STOP that, instead of the person 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choosing and insisting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that he must continue it.
</em><br>
<p>Well, that's not actually true. The coalition of the willing went in to stop
<br>
development and use of WMDs. Laudable self interest, if it is true (??).
<br>
However, the saving of the iraqi people was *not* the driver for this
<br>
action.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To which you did not respond.
</em><br>
<p>You are on my killfile. Sorry. I only see your posts second hand in other's
<br>
replies.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just to clarify, I shall ask you the same question I asked 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Damien, and you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can choose to not answer as he has of course.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is Saddam Hussain morally culpable for the deaths of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; civilians in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Coalition lead effort to remove said murderous tyrant from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power, or is the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; coalition morally culpable?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael Dickey
</em><br>
<p>Both share some of the burden, of course. I believe that the coalition must
<br>
wear the majority, as I've said above. This is balanced by an altered future
<br>
that is the result of their actions; how much so is impossible to say. When
<br>
compared to the aftermath in Afganistan (ie: not stable democracy) it is
<br>
very difficult, I think, to say thus far how much the war is justified by
<br>
the result.
<br>
<p>You are right that I am against the Iraq war. It is because, as I've said
<br>
above, from an extropian standpoint it stinks. I wont outline it again
<br>
(because I have above), but I really think that it should be clear that it
<br>
must be a tool of last resort, if to be used at all. Not only is it a
<br>
(spectacular) waste of resources and lives, it decreases our freedoms at
<br>
home.
