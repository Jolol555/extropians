<em>&gt;Of course my curiosity for why the Tax Police were risking dirtying
</em><br>
<em>&gt;their shoes on the peak at Stromboli piqued my interest and I looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt;further into the strange situation. Historically, they are the police
</em><br>
<em>&gt;force that has the most mountaineering experience, so when Italy
</em><br>

<p>Alfio:
<br>
<em>&gt;This seems strange to me. I would select the Alpini, which is an infantry
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  squadron specially trained for combat in the Alps mountains. But maybe,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  all the Alpini are in the far North Italy, and those volcanoes are in the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Don't know the answer yet, my source of information for my
<br>
previous comment is still away.  I've asked several other people though,
<br>
and the answer looks to be similar what you suggest, la Guardia di Finanzia
<br>
is already there in the South, with the experience. These special troops
<br>
of the Alpini are presently in Afghanistan and Iraq mostly, and
<br>
it would be expensive to  bring them to the Aeolian islands to guard
<br>
volcanoes.
<br>
<p>Thanks for the Carabinieri jokes. Yes indeed there are books of
<br>
Carabinieri jokes at the library. It warms my heart that
<br>
these jokes are an Italian national playtime.
<br>
<p>Here is another:
