<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In particular, I consider it a fact of ethical logic that,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  for any X, we shouldn't believe the claim *:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  (*) Although X is false, we should believe X anyway.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What about where X = &quot;This drug will relieve your illness&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, even then.  Because, what I think you're arguing here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is that, in this case, we should believe X, and hence, we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; shouldn't believe (1), which just says ~X.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note *if* your argument reduces to the assertion that 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mutually contradictory beliefs should not (logically) be held
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by one person. I agree. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you also have the word &quot;ethical&quot; in there, making things
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more interesting. So I'm still probing your initial proposition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There may be a problem with the use of the word &quot;we&quot;. In 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; your example &quot;we&quot; could be the same person, in mine a doctor
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; makes statement X. And note he says &quot;will&quot; not &quot;might&quot; to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; maximise the patients confidence and give the placebo the best
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; chance. Yet it is the patient (another person) who believes X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and in 40% of cases actually benefits from that belief (but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; for the reasons he thinks) but in 60% of cases he does not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; benefit.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, first off, I think it's important to note that my argument 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; isn't a proof that _lying_ is wrong.  
</em><br>
<p>Yep. Noted.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But to clarify the point about &quot;we&quot;, you can replace &quot;we&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in * with any particular individual in this scenario; which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever individual you choose, THAT individual shouldn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe their version of *. Let's call the doctor Alice and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the patient Bob.  What I'll try to show is that Alice shouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe * for Alice, which says that &quot;~X &amp; Alice should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe X&quot;, and Bob shouldn't believe * for Bob, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says that &quot;~X &amp; Bob should believe X.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Starting with Dr. Alice, clearly, she shouldn't believe X,
</em><br>
<p>Agreed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (even if, perhaps, she should tell Bob X,) and she 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't believe that she *should* believe X. 
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice is a doctor. Ethically she should be competent
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;enough to know she is dealing out a placebo, or, even in 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a double blind test, (which I did not stipulate) she should
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;she still know that she *might* be administering a placebo
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and that that placebo *might* not work in this case. She 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;should not want to believe anything that makes her a less
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;competent doctor. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did consider that a doctor who understand the rationale
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for double blind procedures, (ie. That the doctors belief 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that they are administering the real drug rather than the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;placebo, can, of itself convey something of a placebo
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;effect, (or cause the doctor to interpret ambiguous signs
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;from the patient as improvements), might factor this 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding into her consideration. But even if she 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wished she might believe the placebo was effective (for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the sake of conveying the most positive cues to her
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;patient) wishing to believe is not believing. Its not should
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;belief or ought believe. Alice might call in Dr Brian
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;perhaps even lie to him, (temporarily), to maximize the 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;chance of the placebo effect for patient Bob, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alice cannot believe. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- I agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  If she shouldn't believe &quot;Alice should believe X&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then she shouldn't believe &quot;~X &amp; Alice should believe X&quot;, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is * for Alice.  So Alice shouldn't believe *.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Next, let's consider Bob.  Let's suppose, for the sake of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument,  that you're right that Bob should believe X.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... if Bob should believe X, then he shouldn't believe that ~X.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed, when X and ~X are mutually exclusive opposites.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If he shouldn't believe that ~X, he shouldn't believe that &quot;~X &amp; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bob should believe X&quot;, which is * for Bob.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  So Bob shouldn't believe * either.
</em><br>
<p>True.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, if I don't let you suppose that Bob should believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X, if I demand that Bob SHOULDN'T believe X for some
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  reason, then my argument that Bob shouldn't believe * looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just like the argument that Alice shouldn't believe *. 
</em><br>
<p>I think your argument *does* reduce to the assertion that mutually
<br>
exlusive beliefs should not be held by the same person.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  So it doesn't matter what you think Bob should think about X, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he DEFINITELY shouldn't believe *.
</em><br>
<p>True. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are potential benefits in believing white lies told to us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  by others and that being the case they may be being ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  to do so.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, then all I need to prove is that you (the individual) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouldn't believe that they are lies: you should believe that they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are *not* lies. And you shouldn't believe that you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  believe that they're lies.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But this does not amount (nor have you said it does) to 
<br>
a proof that there are no cases in which one should not lie, 
<br>
as the more ethical option, provided that one does so 
<br>
convincingly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, that means that there's no proposition P which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you should believe to be a lie, but you should also believe.
</em><br>
<p>Yep
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That means that if you think you should believe in something,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  then you should believe it; you shouldn't believe it's a lie at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you shouldn't believe that there are any lies that you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The argument is slippery, but, I think, it is correct.
</em><br>
<p>Me too. Well argued.
