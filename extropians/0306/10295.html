The Golden Egg: Chicken Genome Due Next Spring.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/06_03/chicken.shtml">http://www.genomenewsnetwork.org/articles/06_03/chicken.shtml</a>
<br>
<p>What this article doesn't say, but is possibly another very good
<br>
reason for having the &quot;chook&quot; genome is that we may be able
<br>
to use GM (genetically modified) chooks to produce human 
<br>
proteins of therapeutic benefit in their eggs. 
<br>
<p>PHarming. As in Farming but with PH as in pharmaceutical.
<br>
<p>Unlike goats, sheep etc which might be genetically modified 
<br>
to produce proteins in their milk, chooks grow fast and produce
<br>
eggs relatively cheaply.
<br>
<p>As many extropes will know we already produce things 
<br>
like human growth hormone, insulin and growth factor VIII
<br>
and IX and erythropoietin (useful in treating blood diseases)
<br>
in genetically modified e.coli (bacteria).
<br>
<p>Pharming seems to have hit a political wall in the last couple
<br>
of years. Originally the Dolly (the sheep) team were all 
<br>
keen to go with sheep that could produce human proteins
<br>
of therapeutic benefit in their milk but I think they have either
<br>
abandoned or vastly scaled down their efforts on this front.
<br>
<p>Essentially the concern seems to be that viruses may cross
<br>
over from non-human species. The actual risk of this may 
<br>
be miniscule but the political perception of the risk has 
<br>
been far far greater. 
<br>
<p>Pharming using chooks could be 1000 times cheaper than
<br>
pharming using goats sheep etc. Cheap pharm products
<br>
would of course be of interest to the Chinese. So it will 
<br>
be interesting to see if cultural differences between China 
<br>
and the west will yet see China adopt a more liberal
<br>
approach to pharm animals. Maybe China will fewer
<br>
&quot;chicken littles&quot; runinng around saying the sky is falling.
<br>
It will be interesting to see how this plays out.
<br>
