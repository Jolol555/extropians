<br>
<p>Phil,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought the OSS career people became CIA career people to a large 
<br>
degree.  I was always under the impression that policemen in all their many 
<br>
guises that are ranking anywhere from the lower levels up to but below the top 
<br>
leadership positions would almost always find themselves rehired by the victors.  
<br>
Some much of that kind of work depends on knowing the population.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a student in engineering school I worked for one of the major 
<br>
burgular companies as a guard/operator.  Sometimes that called for working in the 
<br>
office operating the alarms and sometimes going out to answer a burgular alarm, 
<br>
investigate the alarm, sometimes capture burgulars and then repair the alarm 
<br>
to put it back in service.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For obvious reasons the details of no installation was ever written 
<br>
down.  Without the knowledge carried only in the heads of the verteran personnel 
<br>
that company would have operated at half speed.  The same goes for a police 
<br>
force.
