Damien replies:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was Damien who chose to use the phrase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;oily omelette&quot; in his harsh response to Spike.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;A sorrowful acknowledgement, in context, that perhaps control of oil
<br>
reserves in the middle east is a legitimate *realpolitik* motive for war on
<br>
Iraq by a high-tech, oil-dependant coalition.&quot;
<br>
<p>As opposed to control of Iraq's oil reserves by a &quot;legitimate&quot; mass murdering 
<br>
psychopath who admired, among others, Joseph Stalin. At least back then it 
<br>
was being used for the benefit of the Iraqi people, right Damien?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I have never read a post of Damien's in which he refers to a Vietnamese
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Communist &quot;re-education camp omelette&quot;, a Castro or Mengistu's &quot;famine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;omelette&quot;, or even a Saddam Hussein's &quot;oily omelette&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The occasion hasn't arisen.&quot;
<br>
<p>And then Damien adds:
<br>
<p>&quot;But the general point seems to me this: there is a moral asymmetry between
<br>
one's standpoint on 
<br>
<p>(a) issues where one's democratic representatives and their affiliates are
<br>
making decisions on one's behalf, 
<br>
<p>and (not-a) choices made by people outside one's sphere of influence.&quot;
<br>
<p>So, oddly enough, given your guidelines, such an &quot;occasion&quot; to criticize 
<br>
brutal totalitarians such as Castro, Le Duan, and Mengistu would never arise.
<br>
<p>&quot;If your deputy is acting in a way you regard as deplorable, it's up to you
<br>
to speak out. If someone over in the next town or nation is doing so, you
<br>
might take a keen interest, but you generally have a lesser moral
<br>
responsibility to speak out.&quot;
<br>
<p>Under what set of moral precepts? Given this rationale, Noam Chomsky and 
<br>
other leftist authors of the 1970s writings and actions criticizing the Nixon 
<br>
administration (their &quot;deputies&quot;) for the bombing of the North Vietnamese and 
<br>
Khmer Rouge forces in Cambodia as &quot;war crimes&quot; was just, as was their subsequent 
<br>
denial of Pol Pot's holocaust. Any set of values that would place these actions 
<br>
at the height of moral righteousness are patently absurd.
<br>
<p>&quot;If Australian, British or US decision makers act, allegedly in my behalf,
<br>
it's far more urgent that I take stock of their actions and speak up for or
<br>
against their choices. If someone in Vietnam, where I have no stake or
<br>
control at all, acts abominably, I might speak up as a concerned, distant
<br>
observer, but the moral situation is rather different, I think.&quot;
<br>
<p>In what bizarre sense would you consider that so? So long as the legitimately 
<br>
elected governments of the West are not the governments sponsoring and 
<br>
authoring institutional policies of mass and arbitrary murder, you then accept and 
<br>
approve of a status quo which tolerates those states outside &quot;your sphere of 
<br>
influence&quot; acting in such a way? Unless one of them really bothers you, then you 
<br>
&quot;might&quot; speak out.. But what recourse, then, is there for the innocent 
<br>
victims of the Prague Spring, or Ho's &quot;Land Reform&quot;, who spoke out and died for it? 
<br>
Oddly enough, not all deputies can be voted out of office should they act in a 
<br>
way contrary to the expectations and preferences of their populace..
<br>
<p>&quot;When Palestinian youths blow up Israelis, I am horrified; when Israeli
<br>
soldiers blow up Palestinians, I am also horrified, perhaps more so, since
<br>
it seems to me, from this great distance, that the power imbalance is in
<br>
the Israelis' favor.&quot;
<br>
<p>Yet it seems to me, from this equally great distance, that the righteousness 
<br>
imbalance is decidely in the Israelis favor too. I do not accept that a 
<br>
democratically elected government and an authoritarian &quot;state&quot; which endorses and 
<br>
encourages terrorism to be morally equivalent. I also believe that were the 
<br>
situations reversed, the dictatorial thug Yasser Arafat's policies would more 
<br>
resemble the Soviets toward say, Czechoslovakia in 1968, then they would Israel's 
<br>
toward the Palestinians.  
<br>
<p>&quot;When I hear that Saddam and his sons and regime tortured and murdered
<br>
people, I am horrified; when I hear that US jails contain a million or more
<br>
prisoners many of them incarcerated for using marijuana and subjected in
<br>
prison to rampant rape and brutality, I am horrified as well.&quot;
<br>
<p>It is beyond the height of absurdity to suggest, as you do here, that arrest 
<br>
in the United States for drug possession (no matter how much one may disagree 
<br>
with said laws) is somehow on the same moral plain as the state sanctioned 
<br>
mass murder, torture, and rape of Saddam Hussein's Iraq. It is equally 
<br>
preposterous to equate life in an American prison of cable television and weight rooms, 
<br>
with one in Uday Hussein's Olympic complex torture chambers.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;In the
<br>
absence of those *realpolitik* global considerations, I think that friends
<br>
of America should be acting by preference to save the victims in the US
<br>
prisons rather than those in the Iraqi prisons.&quot;
<br>
<p>I know I would certainly sleep better at night knowing I helped make the 
<br>
world safer for potheads while innocent children and their parents starve to death 
<br>
or are murdered in Cuba, North Korea, Iraq, or Vietnam. My previous statement 
<br>
was of course sarcasm, and I find such a position as the one you are 
<br>
advocating simply beyond belief.
<br>
<p>&quot;But we do live in a real
<br>
world, so I admit that to sequester the oil reserves for me and my friends
<br>
and for technological civilization it might, after all, be worth expending
<br>
the lives of the willing and those of the innocent victims. The guilty
<br>
victims can rot, as we all agree. But let's not pretend that this choice
<br>
led to an almost bloodless war. There was plenty of blood.&quot;
<br>
<p>I have never said there weren't innocents killed. But let's not pretend that 
<br>
200,000 plus innocents haven't died and wouldn't have continued to do so had 
<br>
there been no war and Saddam Hussein remained in power. So, simply put, given 
<br>
the two realistic alternatives of the Coalition removing Hussein or Hussein 
<br>
remaning in power, do you then acknowledge that you preferred the outcome that 
<br>
left the mass murdering tyrant untouched?
<br>
<p>Regards from everyone's (at least within my sphere of influence) 
<br>
anti-communist,
<br>
