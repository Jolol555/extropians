<em>&gt; ...Yes, of course I see the irony in this...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But then, if we'd wanted to wipe a desire to mess with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our minds, why wouldn't we just do that?
</em><br>
<p>I was joking about wiping away any feelings of guilt that might
<br>
arise if one could and did wipe away particular memories at 
<br>
will.
<br>
<p>Actually, I have to admit, there is an element in my persona 
<br>
that flirts with the dark side. I think it's maybe just a sort of 
<br>
survival instinct. A political sense that makes me ask &quot;what if
<br>
this technology (whatever technology) was used against me
<br>
or people I care about&quot; (which perhaps as chance would
<br>
have it is most people actually -including what Spike terms
<br>
proles but to varying degrees).
<br>
<p>The political sense also fires up because I know others also
<br>
look at new technologies with an element of suspicion and
<br>
often with less fascination or less of an eye for the upside
<br>
and this can lead to them mobilizing to try and ban it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have been ambiguous for some time about whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  people should know what was going on, and only recently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decided to go 'open  source', as it were; partly because of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feedback from various  good folks on these lists..
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thankyou all  :  )    AR
</em><br>
<p>I don't know for sure, but reckon on balance &quot;open&quot; is the
<br>
way to go. When what we are up against is essentially fear 
<br>
of unknown technologies ADDED to worldviews that are
<br>
pretty cynical about what people will do to each other, there
<br>
has to be a good reason in my view to run the political risk of 
<br>
being seen to be working conspiratorially.
<br>
<p>For me the brain is almost the holy of holies. I am confident
<br>
that most of what makes me me is happening in there, but I
<br>
regard it still a bit like a critical production system that is
<br>
running on op code and I haven't got the source. For obvious
<br>
reasons I want to tinker only very carefully.
<br>
<p>Research into the workings of brains though I am all for.
<br>
Perhaps we can reengineer some of the source from the
<br>
op code. I particularly like the idea of being able to add 
<br>
modules dynamically without having to go for an all or
<br>
nothing upload. There is something more appealing about
<br>
being able to test the water with one toe and possibly
<br>
retract it as opposed to jumping in in one great reckless
<br>
plunge.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
