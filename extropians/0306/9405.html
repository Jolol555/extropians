<p>
I am faced with the unfortunate and perhaps hypocritical
<br>
situation of wanting to recommend that other Extropians
<br>
go sign an online petition that I cannot sign myself.
<br>
<p>Since the failure of the Eldred case at the Supreme Court,
<br>
he and Lessig have been pushing for a minimal piece of
<br>
legislation to take back at least some of what has been
<br>
removed from American culture and discourse by the excesses
<br>
of copyright law. He proposes that copyright holders must
<br>
specifically renew their copyrights 50 years after first
<br>
publication of a work, and every five years after, for the
<br>
remainder of whatever term Congress has specified for the
<br>
work. This would allow Disney to maintain its stranglehold
<br>
on their bits of culture, while allowing the vast sea of
<br>
50-year-old abandoned works whose authors can't even be
<br>
tracked down to pass gradually into the public domain.
<br>
<p>I think this is a marvellous step in the right direction of
<br>
making older works available for distribution and use,
<br>
increasing the amount of freely available information from
<br>
which to create new ideas and works of art. I think this is
<br>
an important issue for futurists, and I support the effort
<br>
to pass this legislation, limited though it is. So, please
<br>
go take a look at this petition:
<br>
<p>&lt;<a href="http://www.petitiononline.com/eldred/petition.html">http://www.petitiononline.com/eldred/petition.html</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>Now my ethical conundrum is that the first sentence of the
<br>
petition says something along the lines of &quot;while we believe
<br>
in the value of copyright, we also believe in the value of a
<br>
strong public domain...&quot; Well, I personally don't believe in
<br>
the value of copyright at all. I see this bill as a very
<br>
tiny step in the right direction, so I support its goals,
<br>
but I cannot in good conscience sign a statement I don't
<br>
agree with. However, I believe most people here actually do
<br>
agree with it as written, and since I support its goals, I
<br>
want it to get lots of signatures from people who do agree
<br>
with it. While I reject pragmatism as an ethical value, I
<br>
don't think I actually think of it as a sin, so perhaps I
<br>
can be forgiven this bit of pragrmatism to request support
<br>
for a cause by less-than-ideal means.
