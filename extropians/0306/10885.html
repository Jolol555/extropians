<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; The psychological problem that most people have

<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; against uploading, of course, is that of &quot;being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; inside a computer&quot;, or of knowing that one is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; just on a silicon chip.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps its because I haven't read enough about it, but,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the reservation, I have against uploading, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cryonics is that I just not convinced that, appearances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not withstanding, the me that goes in, will be the me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that comes out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With cryonics, most people are concerned about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncertainty of the technology being able to adequately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repair the damage, both pre-existing age and disease-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; related, and the damage caused by the cryonic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes itself.
</em><br>
<p>It has seemed that way to me. And these are valid
<br>
practical considerations. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But it appears your concern is of more of a philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature related to the nature of personal identity.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. But if there is not a convincing case able to be made
<br>
to someone like me (who is genuinely open minded but 
<br>
sceptical) that personal identity will be retained, cryonics
<br>
doesn't just have a philosophical problem it has a major
<br>
selling problem. If one can only approach cryonics with
<br>
a leap of faith mentality it is competing with religions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps it is a bit different between uploading and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cryonics because uploading changes the matter substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on which one perceives one exists more radically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would have *much* more confidence in uploading to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a more robust and high performance substrate compared
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to risking the damage of freezing and restoring my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological substrate.
</em><br>
<p>So would I but cryonics is possibly available as a solution
<br>
now but is not exactly thriving in the market, uploading is
<br>
not available now.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let's stipulate that the means to do a complete atomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; level recreation of all parts of a cryonically preserved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; person, including the sense of self, and a consistent set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of memories from one's early childhood up until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; moment one voluntarily consented to undergo a cryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; procedure. Like consenting to a life saving general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; anaesthetic. Let's assume the nanotech is good enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to rebuild the exact atomic replica of person X.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So you've duplicated the complete physical body, at some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment in time, to the atomic level.  To me, that appears 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be sufficient, but I realize many persons *feel* and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect we are more than physical machines and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; search for that something special in terms of quantum 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory, mysticism, or non-materialistic philosophy.
</em><br>
<p>The machine analogy doesn't really help when we are 
<br>
trying to retain consciousness as part of personhood and
<br>
no machine is conscious, at least so far as I know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; My current sense is that, to everyone else person X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *will* appear to be the *same* person both before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and after. Person X prime, (Xprime), will perceive himself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to be person X, but it seems to me that neither Xprime's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opinion, nor the opinions of other people are fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; satisfactory when one puts oneself in the place of person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; X considering undergoing cryonics or uploading. It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that person X's predisposition to cryonics or uploading is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; something of a leap of faith or perhaps the sense of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nothing little to lose.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If X, and all his friends observe that he is the same in all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurable ways, then what could be missing?
</em><br>
<p>Say you were X and were replicated whilst alive and your
<br>
replicant though he was you and you did too. Then you
<br>
were informed that you the orignial X were now redundant
<br>
and would be elimated. Would you not feel a sense of 
<br>
impending loss? A desire to continue? Some disastisfaction
<br>
that you could not know that your replicant was you but
<br>
you would know that you'd be dead. Would you not
<br>
have preferred to have moved more steadily towards
<br>
longevity perhaps by adding modules to your still working
<br>
brain and replacing your body. The leaps of faith are
<br>
less. You don't have to jump and hope. You can try
<br>
before you buy.
<br>
<p>To answer you question whats missing may well be
<br>
you except that you are not there to complain or note 
<br>
the fact. Your as gone as a blown out candle flame.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Let me try and use what seems to be an appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; analogy. A candle flame, 'energy' can be transferred or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spread from one candle (a matter substrate) to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; without being extinguished. The flame might also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extinguished on the original substrate and relit. Or with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nanotechnology we may rebuilt a candle that, atom by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atom, is the same as the original candle and relight it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but the *particular* flame, the *particular* energy flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on the substrate will still have been interrupted. Indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it will have been snuffed out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It seems to me that &quot;death&quot; may be analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; candle flame (i.e. a continuous flow of energy dancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; on a matter substrate). Because we eat and exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; atoms throughout our lives the analogy could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extended to say wax is added to the candle whilst the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flame continues to burn. But, extinguish the flame, stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the continuous energy flow, and perhaps you extinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the continuing phenomena, the 'super-consciousness',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (to coin a term covering conscious and unconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; processes) that are the subjective experience of life. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; guess what I'm positing is that, one's life, one's self,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; may depends on continuity. Perhaps something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important to the identity of a person is lost if the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; flow or 'super-conscious' is interrupted. Actually the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness is interrupted sometimes in life but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; along with the unconscious so far as I know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; People have been completely &quot;brain dead&quot; for significant
</em><br>
<em>&gt; periods of time and then revived with no loss of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity. 
</em><br>
<p>Really? Do you have any evidence of this?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I'm not aware of anything physical that is truly continuous
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as you describe it.
</em><br>
<p>I thought brain activity was continuous. If a person flatlines
<br>
and what is flatlining is alledgedly brain activity, I think I'd
<br>
suspect instrument sensitivity issues. 
<br>
<p>I do recall reading in the book What is Life (actually it 
<br>
was not the orignianl but an anthology 50 years after
<br>
Schroedinger (I think) wrote the orignal and posited life
<br>
was an aperiodic crystal) about a spore that could survive
<br>
extraordiary low temperatures and come back to life simply
<br>
with the addition of heat.  
<br>
<p>There were nematode worms that were frozen and survived
<br>
the columbia space shuttle crash. ie. When thawed out they
<br>
got moving etc. But neither these spores or the nematodes
<br>
have much of a consciousness that I am aware of.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you look closely you see that pieces
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the universe appear to be moving around in interesting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns.  To me, the patterns carry all the information, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and are all that's really of interest.  A subset of those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patterns is organized in such a way that it thinks it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; separate, and perceives a &quot;self&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>I thought patterns existed in the mind of the perceiver.
<br>
This makes me thing patterns and information alone
<br>
are insufficient to explain conscious life. Again I am
<br>
not positing anything supernatural or mystical I am simply
<br>
saying I think something is missing, something is not 
<br>
understood. By me at least and perhaps by others 
<br>
as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Following a successful cryonics procedure everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; including the reconstructed X, Xprime, thinks X has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been preserved, this I freely concede. But X the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; original, is no longer around or in a position to confirm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that X the original, X's super-consciousness, X's self,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather than an excellent replication has actually emerged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, does it finally come down to a &quot;leap of faith&quot; on behalf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of the potential cryonaut or the potential upload that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; *they*, X, will *actually* survive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But why does it matter? 
</em><br>
<p>Same answer as above. It matters because cryonics may not
<br>
be a solution even in principle, or it might, but its worth knowing
<br>
and to my mind we don't know well enough yet to convince
<br>
even sceptics like me. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's no need for a leap of faith if everything works as before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your X-prime would know this intuitively. 
</em><br>
<p>The X-prime could be genuinely and deeply mistaken. But he's 
<br>
fine. It X the original that is not there. 
<br>
