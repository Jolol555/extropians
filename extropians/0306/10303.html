Friends,

<p>Oy!  
<br>
<p>For he record, I've no quarrel with Spud (which is, I
<br>
assure you, a friendly nick).  He seems to me a
<br>
decent, smart, open-minded fellow.  And nobody's fool.
<br>
&nbsp;We have differences, but what's that?  Just a
<br>
resource for a lively exchange of views, and the
<br>
chance to maybe learn something. 
<br>
<p>I'm a non-religious jew, or as I sometimes like to
<br>
say, jew-boy, (mischievously exercising the license
<br>
granted to those who are members of a group to say
<br>
things not allowed 'outsiders').  I was born in
<br>
Jersey, and love Jews and Italians (and girls with
<br>
not-too-large-breasts, among others)--passionate
<br>
people who wave their hands when they breathe, and
<br>
whose mothers make soup and bread to raise the dead,
<br>
...or, as the old joke goes, at least it voodn't hoit.
<br>
&nbsp;I think the American dream and the jewish dream are
<br>
identical, and I'm a 100% true believer in it/them. 
<br>
But...
<br>
<p>I have the deepest possible enmity for zionism.  It is
<br>
**THE** root of the problem in the mideast.  It is a
<br>
betrayal of the most sacred values of Judaism,
<br>
poisoning its ethical center, and threatening its very
<br>
destruction as none of its external adversaries ever
<br>
could.  Zionism totally delegitimizes the state of
<br>
Israel and transforms the thousand-year-old dream of a
<br>
land of milk and honey, a dream of hope and compassion
<br>
and justice, into a nightmare of blood and bile.  I
<br>
don't think I am the only jew who feels this way, at
<br>
once outraged and heartsick.  
<br>
<p>This is what the spudster has noticed in my postings
<br>
on the subject, and which he fairly characterizes when
<br>
he writes that my &quot;posts seem antagonsitic at best&quot;.
<br>
<p>Back when I was posting on this, spud was the only one
<br>
who got past the arguments over the context-defining
<br>
historical events to ask after my version of a
<br>
solution. By that time I'd had it up to here (holds
<br>
hand level with eyeballs)with the subject, and I never
<br>
did respond, but I appreciated it, and I remember. 
<br>
It's so frustrating--and a central feature of the
<br>
Israel/Palestine problem--that discussion stalls over
<br>
historical culpability and never gets on to the
<br>
positivity of solution seeking.
<br>
<p>So let me take this opportunity to offer my &quot;short and
<br>
cranky&quot; version of a solution to the I/P problem. 
<br>
It's one of the less creative solutions, but it'll
<br>
have to do for now.  
<br>
<p>Take the territory comprising &quot;Israel&quot; and the west
<br>
bank and Gaza, combine them into one country, and
<br>
change the spelling (while leaving the pronunciation
<br>
up to the individual) to P-A-L-E-S-T-I-N-E.  Then,
<br>
xerox a copy of the US Constitution, scratch out the
<br>
USofA wherever it is found and write in
<br>
P-A-L-E-S-T-I-N-E.  Bring everyone who ever lived
<br>
there back in.  Get your bean counters workin' on the
<br>
restoration of private property according to who owned
<br>
what before the nastiness began.  (If there's a
<br>
shortfall here, where guiltless/good faith folks have
<br>
conflicting claims, then have the Brits,
<br>
American-supporters-of-Israel, Zionists, and Saudi's
<br>
foot the bill.)  Disarm everyone, hold elections, and
<br>
start out fresh.  Rinse and repeat.
<br>
<p>(Same for Iraq, by the way.)
<br>
<p>Finally, just for fun, allow me to add, relating to
<br>
this topic, an excerpt, entertaining, perhaps mildly
<br>
humorous, by an obscure scribbler.  See if you can
<br>
figure out who the author is:
<br>
<p>&quot;...if I thought myself prejudiced against the Jew, I
<br>
should hold it fairest to leave this subject to a
<br>
person not crippled in that way. But I think I have no
<br>
such prejudice. A few years ago a Jew observed to me
<br>
that there was no uncourteous reference to his people
<br>
in my books, and asked how it happened. It happened
<br>
because the disposition was lacking. I am quite sure
<br>
that (bar one) I have no race prejudices, and I think
<br>
I have no color prejudices nor caste prejudices nor
<br>
creed prejudices. Indeed, I know it. I can stand any
<br>
society. All that I care to know is that a man is a
<br>
human being -- that is enough for me; he can't be any
<br>
worse. I have no special regard for Satan; but, I can
<br>
at least claim that I have no prejudice against him.
<br>
It may even be that I lean a little his way, on
<br>
account of his not having a fair show. All religions
<br>
issue bibles against him, and say the most injurious
<br>
things about him, but we never hear his side. We have
<br>
none but the evidence for the prosecution, and yet we
<br>
have rendered the verdict. To my mind, this is
<br>
irregular. It is un-English; it is un-American; it is
<br>
French. Without this precedent Dreyfus could not have
<br>
been condemned. Of course Satan has some kind of a
<br>
case, it goes without saying. It may be a poor one,
<br>
but that is nothing; that can be said about any of us.
<br>
As soon as I can get at the facts I will undertake his
<br>
rehabilitation myself, if I can find an unpolitic
<br>
publisher. It is a thing which we ought to be willing
<br>
to do for any one who is under a cloud. We may not pay
<br>
him reverence, for that would be indiscreet, but we
<br>
can at least respect his talents. A person who has for
<br>
untold centuries maintained the imposing position of
<br>
spiritual head of four-fifths of the human race, and
<br>
political head of the whole of it, must be granted the
<br>
possession of executive abilities of the loftiest
<br>
order. In his large presence the other popes and
<br>
politicians shrink to midges for the microscope. I
<br>
would like to see him. I would rather see him and
<br>
shake him by the tail than any other member of the
<br>
European Concert.&quot;            
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;You are what you think.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jeff Davis
