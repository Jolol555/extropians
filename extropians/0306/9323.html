Re: Aleph:
<br>
<p>Sure, sure, but you start counting wth Cantor numbers and see how far you 
<br>
get! :P
<br>
&lt;That's at least an Aleph-One... joke, for those who ddn't get it.)
<br>
<p>&lt;Cool A=1 identity issues elided&gt;
<br>
<p>A kindred issue: I have been told that the pre-Socratics had, in whatever 
<br>
variety of early Greekoid they spoke, the same sort of confusion between 
<br>
the &quot;is&quot; of existing and the &quot;is&quot; of possessing-a-property that we as naive 
<br>
thinkers can get into in English, which is to me a striking thing since I 
<br>
can (I think) easily imagine a language that uses a &quot;has&quot;-analog for 
<br>
properties and doesn't get into that water.
<br>
<p>But I wonder how likely that is to develop a priori (well, early) from an 
<br>
evolutionary biology standpoint. Especially if people really are using 
<br>
their sensory modalities for thinking, and, to whatever extent, reasoning 
<br>
(a la Lakeoff's work)...
<br>
<p>And that makes me wonder about a weak analog to Jaynes's Bicameral Mind 
<br>
stories; that the scaffolding of thinking has changed in some significant 
<br>
way in the relatively recent past. Do you follow? The abstract problems one 
<br>
can address when one can reason that way are very different from the ones 
<br>
that don't get you killed as a HG or serf, mostly.
<br>
<p>Final random thought related to the above: what if &quot;AD(H)D&quot; is just what 
<br>
more and more of we monkeys do when developmentally exposed to what we 
<br>
monkeys have been doing more and more of lately? Is that a possible sigmoid 
<br>
shaper that will tend to slow any singularity takeoff? How bad, really, is 
<br>
the battle betwen &quot;being nibbled to death by ducks&quot; (distraction to 
<br>
overwhelm by irrelevancies) and missing a bet? Are we being told it's worse 
<br>
than it really is? Are we worrying ourselves to death?
<br>
<p>Is there any escape from noise?
<br>
<p>MMB
