</em><br>
<p>I agree that many harsh words and exaggerated characterizations have been
<br>
made by all concerned in these debates.  No one person or one side has
<br>
a monopoly on these errors.
<br>
<p>War crimes mean more than the things you list above.  See
<br>
<a href="http://www.survivorsrightsinternational.org/definitions/war_crimes.mv">http://www.survivorsrightsinternational.org/definitions/war_crimes.mv</a>
<br>
for a page defining war crimes.  Generally they refer to violations of
<br>
the Geneva conventions.  War crimes are acts of violence.  No posting
<br>
to a mailing list can be a war crime.  And no one has claimed otherwise;
<br>
no one has accused any poster to the Extropians lists of war crimes.
<br>
<p>Perhaps you are just using the phrase &quot;war crimes&quot; as a shorthand for the
<br>
various harsh and unfair accusations you list.  Unfortunately this has
<br>
the effect of further polarizing the debate as it implies that people
<br>
have accused other Extropians of commiting heinous acts tantamount to
<br>
executing prisoners of war or engaging in torture and mutilation.
<br>
<p>I encourage all parties to tone down the rhetoric and avoid making
<br>
stronger claims about the actions of others than are justified by
<br>
the facts.
<br>
<p>Hal
