<br>
and even if it were true you have to judge that you are much better and more 
<br>
rational at analyzing that information that the other traders out there.  
<br>
Unless you have a good reason for thinking this, you are the fool at the poker 
<br>
table.
<br>
<p>Yes, Robin.  I do believe I have a very good reason to think so -- as would 
<br>
you or anyone else, if you made my same assumptions.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My old college math professor used to say to pay particular attention 
<br>
to assumptions.  Am I correct in hearing two very different assumptions 
<br>
between you and the market on the one hand but Buffet, myself, and some others on 
<br>
the other hand?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I make no assumption about the market, about what it will do tomorrow, 
<br>
next year or in ten years.  I would just as soon never sell my investment.  
<br>
Am I correct that you are assuming that the market and its movements are 
<br>
important?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't intend to make money off the market.  I am only asking is this 
<br>
investment returning 15% on my money and is it likely to continue to do so?  
<br>
Only after I consider that is a safe bet do I have a secondary interest in 
<br>
what the market is doing, has done or might do.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But as far as understanding Buffet's methods.  I believe he is so 
<br>
different and so simple that people have a little problem dealing with him.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I said my grandfather used the same fundamental approach to buying 
<br>
lifestock.  First, he really knew his product (hogs &amp; cattle chiefly) and he knew 
<br>
his market (where he was going to make an immediate sale, he held nothing)  
<br>
He would look at a lot of stock for sale.  He could weight them with his eye, 
<br>
and know exactly to whom he could sell even by the pound and cut if necessary.  
<br>
He would determine his income, deduct his personal requirements for money, 
<br>
deduct a safety margin and make an offer.  He never knew what anything was worth 
<br>
only what it was worth to him.  The same goes for Buffet.
