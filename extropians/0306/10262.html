<p>I wouldn't say so. Its competition between domestic producers of
<br>
artificial psychochemicals and foreign producers of natural ones. I
<br>
encourage others to read this month's issue of New York Magazine about
<br>
how well medicated Manhattanites are these days with psychiatric
<br>
prescriptions, to the point that home hobby experimentation and
<br>
medication swapping is commonplace, and many such individuals find the
<br>
prescription pills like Ritalin, Prozac, Adavan, etc are of superior
<br>
quality and effect with fewer side effects than drugs like coke or
<br>
smack. Dealers in illegal drugs are now dealing in both markets and
<br>
finding the psych market to be more lucrative, more respectable, and
<br>
less risky.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Keep in mind that deflation is not the same thing as devaluation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: Fair enough; I don't really differentiate because in my mind, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two are fundamentally linked.  Short-term effects though, do require
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descriptive differentiation...
</em><br>
<p>Actually, they tend to be inversely related when all other factors are
<br>
equal. When prices deflate, it is because the dollar is increasing in
<br>
value. Inflation results in devaluation (which is why you frequently
<br>
see banana republics devaluing their currency vs other national
<br>
currencies by fiat as a means of halting hyperinflation domestically.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Deflation is when prices decrease (normally occurs when the value of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the dollar increases), while devaluation is when the dollar is worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less of competetive currencies. Most of the deflationary pressure is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from falling energy prices (and prices that are impacted by energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prices). Since energy prices were previously inflated solely due to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; war jitters, this should not, IMHO, be considered a bad thing, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the deflation is not a sign of anything systemically wrong with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The dollar, somewhat contradictorily, is also devaluing, mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because many countries pissed at our foreign policy are changing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how their own currencies are anchored, from a dollar standard to a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; euro standard. This also IMHO is actually a paper tiger that is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more likely to help us than hurt us. It gives the French the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; false prestige they crave, while at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same time inflating the prices of their exports, which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; negatively impact their economy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: Agreed regarding the devaluation of the dollar (since it is in my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion, pumped up artificially).
</em><br>
<p>If it is pumped up artificially, it is done so more by foreign
<br>
governments in order to keep their exports to the US artificially
<br>
cheaper. The only people here in the US that overvalued money helps are
<br>
the bankers and other money people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With decreased demand for dollars overseas, this makes our money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cheap internationally while at the same time paradoxically of high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; value domestically. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: cute, I didn't make this connection :)  You're basically saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that more money will flood in to our country, at the same time the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign imports go up in price...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; similarly, inflation will rise for domestic goods because there will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be more money floating around, unless of course, the fed raises 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interest rates or reserve requirements...
</em><br>
<p>No, domestic product prices will deflate (not inflate, as you infer) as
<br>
dollars become cheaper vs other currencies, while prices of foreign
<br>
imports to the US will inflate. The only possible inflationary
<br>
pressures on domestic products would be if overseas demand for US
<br>
exports causes increased domestic product scarcity here.
<br>
<p>This will not be so noticeable in areas where so many domestically
<br>
finished products are made with foreign parts (like the car market).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This can only be a good thing for the US, and will result in a return
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of many manufacturing jobs to the US, especially skilled blue collar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jobs. Imports will decrease and exports will increase. The trade 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deficit, an artifact of our currency being the lingua franca of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; international finance, will fade from view and might even become 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a trade surplus. I predict that within a decade the US economy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will resemble Japan of the 70s and 80's. Consumer savings will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skyrocket. A speculative bubble of a size never before seen will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occur across the entire economy, which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; last as long as people are confident that they are making rational
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions (and so long as the facts they are basing those decisions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on remain accurate).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Me: sadly, I'm just starting out in my fiscal historical analysis :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I don't have many years of experience watching the markets on the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like; I can't comment...
</em><br>
<p>My primary experience was being involved in the late 80's real estate
<br>
development industry and watching it implode and melt down when the
<br>
reserve ratio got screwed with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, out of curiousity, what do you think about the housing market? I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think its going to tank bigtime, but my father is of the opposite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion..
</em><br>
<p>Which housing market? There are a number in various regions. Here in
<br>
northern New England, years of anti-growth local politics is running
<br>
head-on into development pressures due to a labor shortage and a
<br>
housing shortage. If NH gets selected as the Free State target state,
<br>
it will have another 20,000 people and their families moving in,
<br>
increasing an already dire market in many areas. Prices will go up more
<br>
before they get better, but they won't retreat below levels of a year
<br>
or so ago.
<br>
<p>Other regions of the country have their own macroeconomic conditions in
<br>
play beyond national issues. The real estate market only goes to hell
<br>
nationally when the fed either raises interest rates significantly, or
<br>
if they change the reserve ratio their nationalized banks are required
<br>
to retain in liquid reserve assets (i.e. cash vs. loans) by a
<br>
significant amount in a short period (this was the cause of the burst
<br>
of the late 80's real estate bubble, instigated by a democrat appointed
<br>
by Bush I as a concession to DNC controlled congress.)
<br>
<p>When lots of banks are forced to call in large numbers of loans (to
<br>
reduce liabilities and increase liquid assets) on developments that are
<br>
not selling well, you get a catalytic wave of bankruptcies that
<br>
triggers a greater avalanche of insolvency.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My reasoning is that fundamentally, it doesn't matter how low the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; market rates go, if people are unemployed and getting laid off.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally don't think he (Bush) is going to be able to create 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough jobs... I'm predicting there's going to be a wave of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreclosures coming within the next 2-3 years...  Especially given
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the housing market is way overpriced, and anybody who still has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; savings is dumping it into their house for equity because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the stock market is so flat, and the bond market's return is so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neglible... My father is banking on the election year theory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (self-explanatory).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What's your opinion?
</em><br>
<p>See my comments above. I don't regard the market as overpriced in most
<br>
areas. Anti-growth laws and politicians create inflated demand, which
<br>
inflates real estate prices until the laws are changed or politicians
<br>
are removed from office and development that meets market demand is
<br>
allowed to occur. The key difference between today's real estate bubble
<br>
and the late 80's is that then people were blowing smoke out their
<br>
asses, while today it is a matter of politicians creating artificial
<br>
demand by restricting property rights. The end result may be the same
<br>
if developers rapidly oversupply the market, but it all depends on how
<br>
it is handled by the various powers that be. If change occurs too
<br>
rapidly, the insulin shock could certainly cause problems. I don't
<br>
think it will happen before the election, though, because luddite
<br>
politicians won't lose their offices until after that election. Expect
<br>
movement next summer one way or the other. Until then expect moderate
<br>
economic growth linked to deflating energy costs and a sea change in
<br>
the import/export picture.
