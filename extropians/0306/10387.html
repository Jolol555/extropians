<p>
Note:  The first part of this message pertains to Vietnam and Harvey's
<br>
comments on evidence of list members persuasions, and the second part
<br>
pertains to the general discussion of honest debate.
<br>
<p>Harvey said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is true that the exact phrase &quot;war crimes&quot; was not used in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the incidents I complained about.  Try looking for people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being accused of supporting communism
</em><br>
<p>AND
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wrong.  When someone is accused of being supporting communism, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terrorism, or the enemy without any evidence,that is slander.
</em><br>
<p>AND
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I disagree.  There is no tiny kernel of truth.  None of these people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have ever given any indication of supporting the enemy.
</em><br>
<p>I find this particular example interesting.  Harvey, what if someone
<br>
accuses somebody of one of these and has evidence to support that, even
<br>
a 'tiny kernel', what then?
<br>
<p>I note in the thread  &quot;Re:META: Dishonest debate (was &quot;cluster bombs&quot;)&quot;
<br>
That I presented evidence that a list member and extropian, Jeff Davis,
<br>
'supports' communism and finds the current North Vietnamese communist
<br>
government a legitimate one.  Considering Eliezer's emotional reaction
<br>
to absurdity of the notion of an extropian supporting this type of
<br>
government (noting that FreedomHouse.org ranks Iraq and Vietnam both at
<br>
the lowest ratings in their measurements of freedom), I am surprised
<br>
that this post garnered NO response from the list in general.  
<br>
<p>Here we have, on the extropian list, an extropian, suggesting (I
<br>
contend) not only that the communist north Vietnamese government is
<br>
legit, but that the atrocities it has committed, and perhaps any
<br>
atrocities committed by communist governments are actually because
<br>
capitalists wouldn't simply leave the communists alone.  However, since
<br>
'supports' requires adequate semantic definition of its own, perhaps I
<br>
am inferring incorrectly and Jeff actually does not think that the
<br>
communist north Vietnamese govt is a legit one.  Perhaps Jeff would make
<br>
the record official on that question?  I refer readers directly to
<br>
Jeff's relevant comments, see what you think he means...
<br>
<p>&quot;[there is] No &quot;enslavement&quot; by the communists, just a different form of
<br>
government facing the difficult task of rebuilding a country savaged by
<br>
124 years of foreign dictatorships, and made all the more difficult by
<br>
the opposition of the political elite of the world's richest and most
<br>
powerful country.  An elite filled with hostility by their defeat at the
<br>
hands of a people with the brains, discipline, and courage to pay the
<br>
enormous price required to &quot;refuse&quot; the tyranny of foreign dictators&quot;
<br>
<p>And
<br>
<p>&quot;All governments have laws for the maintenance of social order.  Freedom
<br>
of speech has its limitations.  I may not cry &quot;fire!&quot; in a crowded
<br>
theater, nor advocate the violent overthrow of the US government.
<br>
Communists (and their subsequent governments), under siege by the
<br>
capitalists from before the ink was dry on the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, feel the
<br>
need to protect themselves from foreign subversion&quot;
<br>
<p>And 
<br>
<p>&quot;  by suppressing dissent and political competition.Not the American
<br>
tradition, for sure, but neither uncommon nor necessarily the demon evil
<br>
that your ideological psychosis screams in your head and out into the
<br>
world.  It is easy to pass judgment on others. But that judgment,
<br>
informed only by the passionate animus of ideological fantasy is a
<br>
&quot;twisted&quot; cartoon of genuine, thoughtful ethical practice.&quot;
<br>
<p>Further, Harvey, since you have made a good presence at suggesting what
<br>
could be considered to be good conclusion to reasonable draw from others
<br>
comments, I wonder how you interpret Jeff's statements?  Since this
<br>
revelation on Jeff's part sparked no comments, then perhaps I inferred
<br>
completely incorrectly and every other extropian out there is thinking
<br>
'That's not what Jeff was saying, idiot!'  Or, alternatively, perhaps no
<br>
one founds Jeff's comments startling at all, even though they found my
<br>
interpretation correct (or not).  Or, third, perhaps no one saw the
<br>
post, as I am no doubt the member of many kill files.  At the risk of my
<br>
being confused with a barking dog, perhaps the issue could be readily
<br>
cleared if Jeff takes an official stance on the legitimacy of the North
<br>
Vietnamese govt, or the legitimacy of communism in general.  Would you
<br>
consider Jeff's comments to a be kernel of evidence suggesting he
<br>
supports the 'enemy' (in this case, a clear enemy of extropinism, a
<br>
corrupt totalitarian repressive state)
<br>
<p>[end of Vietnam stuff]
<br>
<p>Harvey later noted:
<br>
<p>&quot;Do you realize that this is ad hominem?  You are no longer discussing
<br>
the merits of the paper.  You are discussing the merits of the person
<br>
who wrote it.  You are no longer questioning the points he made.  You
<br>
are now questioning the person who made those points.&quot;
<br>
<p>I must say I find this to be a valid point.  Focus on the arguments, not
<br>
the arguer.  However, in attempting to do this, If I should point out
<br>
that (for example) Jeff's arguments are in support of communism, am I
<br>
not directly implying that he is also, since he is the one making those
<br>
arguments?  Thusly, I could be accused of an ad hominem, even though I
<br>
am attacking the argument, and not the arguer.  I suppose the only way
<br>
to avoid this is if one qualifies any arguments that they present by
<br>
distancing themselves from the argument, i.e. &quot;The typical counter
<br>
argument to that would be...&quot;
<br>
<p>Harvey also noted:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; terrorism, Saddam, bin 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Laden, being a traitor, or giving aid and comfort to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enemy.  These are the phrases you will find.  Also look 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; specifically in the threads about the Iraq war.  This is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where these accusations are being made.  
</em><br>
<p>Harvey, I would be interested in seeing some examples if you have them
<br>
readily available, especially if you feel I am guilty of any of the
<br>
behavior you mention as I was recently informed that there have been
<br>
complaints about my posts.  Though no specifics were provided, I am
<br>
always up for self-improvement.
<br>
<p>For reference, I would be interested in seeing also examples where
<br>
people use phrases contextual similar to 'brainwashed patriot'
<br>
'jingoist' 'red neck' 'flag waving automaton' etc. etc.  I notice the
<br>
complaints you launch tend only toward a particular ideology, and are in
<br>
defense only of people who tend to share similar ideologies, e.g.:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Thanks!  But it's not just me.  Amara, Damien, Eliezer, Emlyn, Hubert,
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; James, Jeff, Mez, Olga, Samantha and I have all been recently accused 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of somehow supporting the enemy.  These baseless personal attacks seem
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; to be a widespread problem.
</em><br>
<p>Ron, Lee, Myself, MaxPlumm, John Clark, and people who profess
<br>
ideologies similar to our group have received such wonderful
<br>
descriptions as those above, and had similar amazing statements such as
<br>
&quot;Foaming tribalist fanatics&quot; &quot;To the extent that patriotism switches on,
<br>
the brain switches off.  To the extent that the brain stays on, it's
<br>
because patriotism is being kept on a leash&quot;, &quot;Patriotism skews people's
<br>
ability to analyze which side, if any, is in the right.&quot; &quot;tired war
<br>
drivel&quot; etc. etc.
<br>
<p>Personally, I have been called a red neck, a liar, dishonest, compared
<br>
to a barking dog, out of my mind... among many other colorful
<br>
descriptions.
<br>
<p>I note that as good as you have been a pointing out dishonest debating I
<br>
don't recall you ever criticizing statements like the ones above
<br>
directed toward people who have a generally different ideology.  I also
<br>
never once saw you criticize Humania for making such comments to me as
<br>
<p>&quot;You (plural; the patriots here) twist around the words of your
<br>
opponents&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;you (plural) were fucked up by your humble servants called Bush
<br>
administration&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;could it be that your  Pentagon and-White-House-dominated thinking in
<br>
union with adrenalin-aided visualizations of smashing those Middle
<br>
Eastern bastards which amplifies the already existing territorial
<br>
bullshit in your brain&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;vicious circle of astonishingly flexible ancient lizard brain circuits
<br>
that spread the message towards the cortex to merely defend&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;If in June 2003 you are still on the same level as your fellow
<br>
republican US politicians while dealing with ultra conservative monkey
<br>
business like territorial pissings with funnily talking Arabs who
<br>
stubbornly deny wearing blue jeans and display this strange effeminate
<br>
outfit while unexpectedly rejecting the American way of life altogether&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Meanwhile I am trying to find a new language to communicate my extreme
<br>
disgust at the way some incurable patriots here still stick to His
<br>
Phoniness George &quot;Proud 'n' Pray&quot; W. Bush and his gang of deathists,
<br>
called US government  How many more times must you be fucked up by these
<br>
dilapidated religious fundamentalists&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I will not stop shouting, I am against THIS war. You are deadly wrong
<br>
and you should hear it again every day!&quot;
<br>
<p>Do *any* of these statements belong on this list?
<br>
<p>Of course, as you note, just because you did not speak out against it
<br>
does not mean you supported it!  However, I would say, if anything,
<br>
Humania is *at least* as guilty as any particular member of the opposing
<br>
ideology at emotional rhetoric, name calling, and generally vitriolic
<br>
posts.
<br>
<p>In fact, I submit, that this is nothing more then an ideological
<br>
division, with one side saying the other is resorting to name calling,
<br>
rhetoric, and baseless accusation while the other side insists the same.
<br>
There is no doubt that people of all persuasions are at least somewhat
<br>
guilty of this, and we can all certainly stand to make an effort to
<br>
improve.  But to single out only those that are in opposition to your
<br>
ideologies (again, noting that you assert your silence is not the same
<br>
as support, and noting that perhaps you have criticized comments similar
<br>
to those mentioned above made by people who generally share a similar
<br>
ideology to yours but that I do not know of) seems to me to be a
<br>
generally inaccurate way to represent the current list goings on.
<br>
<p>Hopefully no one found that post offensive
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
