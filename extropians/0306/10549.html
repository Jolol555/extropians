<p><p><em>&gt; However, I have stumbled across a separate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; GM-crop issue, a legal problem--gene patent law legal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem--which might reasonably be seen by any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; county's leadership as grounds for signing on to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; treaty in question so as to preserve the freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; action which is the treaty's central feature.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Consequently, folks wanting to promote the value
</em><br>
<em>&gt; offered by GM crops will need to consider the problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and how it might be corrected.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps you've heard of this.  In 1997, a Canadian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmer, with long years of growing canola, found
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Round-Up (tm) resistant canola growing in one of his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fields, the result of the wind borne spread of pollen
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the nearby fields of other growers.  He was an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alert and knowledgeable farmer and knew it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genetically modified and how it got into his seed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stock, and subsequently into his crop--he would sell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; his crop, but hold back seed for planting next year's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crop.  He selectively saved the seed from the Round-Up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resistant plants and planted them, mixed with others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for his 1998 crop.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Monsanto, the patent holders on the gene conferring
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Round-Up resistance, sued the farmer for patent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infringement, and won, and won on appeal, and now the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; farmer is counter-suing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Here's a couple of links to the story:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The whole shebang
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://www.percyschmeiser.com/">http://www.percyschmeiser.com/</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the appeals court decision
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fct/2002/2002fca309.html">http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fct/2002/2002fca309.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've spent the last hour or so reading parts of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Appeals Court Decision and thinking it over, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't gotten to the counter suit.  I've been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guessing thought about what approach the counter suit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; might take.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It isn't over till it's over, but at this juncture, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; looks like the patent holder can broadcast his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollen/gene, and then bill the owner of any plant so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pollinated--unwilling or no--for any possession or use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of any plant tissue containing the gene.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So here's a case where the uncontrolled release of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gene, a predictable consequence of commercial-scale
</em><br>
<em>&gt; canola agriculture, poses a threat those farmers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; previously uninvolved, unaffected, and independent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To put in the words of the article below:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;  ...genetic mutations could ...cause havoc...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At least havoc in the 'commercial environment'.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Grounds for the treaty, or no?
</em><br>
<p>I don't think this one case is grounds for either supporting
<br>
or opposing the UN treaty on GM foods.
<br>
<p>I think there are two separate issues involved, GMOs, and
<br>
IP law review, both of which involve technologies that raise
<br>
legitimate questions of social policy and that are attracting a
<br>
large amount of interest internationally. Yet on both issues
<br>
there is substantially more noise, misrepresentation and
<br>
public comment about than constructive debate and informed
<br>
consideration.
<br>
<p>Add the ongoing battle about trade barriers relating to imports
<br>
and protections on food and you get a third dimension that
<br>
seems to be substantially based on finding reasons not to go
<br>
along with free market economics in the area of food. The
<br>
GM issue can be convenient for making a special case. A
<br>
case which is likely to resonate with some national farm
<br>
lobbies pre-existing biases.
<br>
<p>Canada, where the case to which you refer occurred, does
<br>
not enforce an identical set of IP laws to the US. From
<br>
memory The Harvard Oncomouse for instance was not
<br>
granted a patent in Canada.
<br>
<p>The string of articles in your first link contains phrases
<br>
like &quot;David and Goliath battle&quot; and &quot;the controversial
<br>
alchemy of genetic engineering, which has alarmed
<br>
environmentalists and consumers&quot;. Makes for good
<br>
copy but poor information to a public lacking it.
<br>
<p>I recall at one stage outrage about Monsanto
<br>
producing a crop that was infertile in the second
<br>
generation and the flak they copped being called
<br>
MonSatan etc because the story got around that
<br>
they were looking to monopolise the worlds food
<br>
supply. It was also possible that the GE they did
<br>
was designed to stop the cross pollination and spreading
<br>
of their crop into the wild. So it could be that they
<br>
were trying to respond to one commonly held community
<br>
concern and ran head long into another. Or it could
<br>
be the truth was somewhere in the middle.
<br>
