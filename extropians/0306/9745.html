<br>
<p>Einstein's quote regarding Spinoza's God was:  &quot;I believe in Spinoza's God
<br>
who reveals himself in the orderly harmony of what exists, not in a God who
<br>
concerns himself with fates and actions of human beings.&quot;
<br>
<p>Michael Gilmore wrote an article regarding &quot;Einstein's God,&quot; that concluded:
<br>
&quot;Although not a favorite of physicists, Einstein, The Life and Times, by the
<br>
professional biographer Ronald W. Clark (1971), contains one of the best
<br>
summaries on Einstein's God: &quot;However, Einstein's God was not the God of
<br>
most men. When he wrote of religion, as he often did in middle and later
<br>
life, he tended to...clothe with different names what to many ordinary
<br>
mortals--and to most Jews--looked like a variant of simple
<br>
agnosticism...This was belief enough. It grew early and rooted deep. Only
<br>
later was it dignified by the title of cosmic religion, a phrase which gave
<br>
plausible respectability to the views of a man who did not believe in a life
<br>
after death and who felt that if virtue paid off in the earthly one, then
<br>
this was the result of cause and effect rather than celestial reward.
<br>
Einstein's God thus stood for an orderly system obeying rules which could be
<br>
discovered by those who had the courage, the imagination, and the
<br>
persistence to go on searching for them.&quot;
<br>
&quot;Einstein continued to search, even to the last days of his 76 years, but
<br>
his search was not for the God of Abraham or Moses. His search was for the
<br>
order and harmony of the world. &quot;
<br>
<p>O.
