<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I do read the  postings of people whose opinions are diametrically
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;oppposed to mine.
</em><br>
<p>Me too, it's sort of fun actually, a guilty pleasure, like looking at a
<br>
freak show.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;You (plural; the patriots here)
</em><br>
<p>I think you will find few right wing flag waving mindless patriots on this
<br>
list, in fact most are anti government, it's just that after 911 it became
<br>
clear that there is a sub group in another culture that want us dead and is
<br>
doing everything they can think of to brink it about. Solving that little
<br>
problem tends to overcome other ideological objections we may have at least
<br>
for the near term.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;If  you don't FEEL - yes, the extropian buzz word - that you are
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;deathly wrong
</em><br>
<p>That's the core of your confusion right there, Extropians are less
<br>
interested in what they feel is right than what they think is right. If
<br>
we're wrong then show us why and we'll even thank you for correcting our
<br>
error, but just coming out with a emotional outburst and a new string of
<br>
insults will not convince anybody of anything except that you're a crank.
<br>
For example, in your last post you said America should turn its back on
<br>
Capitalism but gave no hint why we should do such a strange thing.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt; I am sick and tired of this American madness to be a winner all
</em><br>
<em>     &gt; the time.
</em><br>
<p>The alternative does not strike me as particularly appealing.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I wish, you as a nation might relax a bit and leave the world in
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; peace with your eternal winner attitude.
</em><br>
<p>In other words rollover play dead and wait for the next 911; I must say that
<br>
really doesn't sound like very good advice to me, but I could be wrong.
<br>
