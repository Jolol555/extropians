<p>Eliezer, are you assuming that the market behaves as a game of chance?
<br>
I can speak authoritatively as an employee who once had incentive
<br>
stock options that I tended to trade on informtion (or more accurately
<br>
impressions) that were not available to the average public investor.
<br>
They were based on information regarding what one knew what oneself
<br>
was working on or what others were working on within the company that
<br>
were not released to the public.  I would say that a very well informed
<br>
analyst who really studies a company (and its industry) has similar
<br>
abilities to evaluate a company prospects and trends and can make
<br>
&quot;better than average&quot; recommendations.  The average investor on the
<br>
other hand cannot (or does not usually) take the time to get to know
<br>
the details of a company (and the industry in which it resides) and
<br>
cannot therefore make an &quot;informed&quot; investment.  There is simply too
<br>
much information out there for people who are not &quot;within&quot; the industry
<br>
or who are not professional analysts.
<br>
<p>Now that doesn't mean that employees or analysts always get it right.
<br>
But it isn't a game of &quot;chance&quot;.  To balance this one has things like
<br>
mutual funds and certified financial planners who are supposed to
<br>
know more than the average investor and have better chances at
<br>
performing better than &quot;chance&quot;.
