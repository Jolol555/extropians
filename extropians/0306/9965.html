<em>&gt; &gt; The problem is that for his paradox to work, the games have to be set

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Haven't reviewed your posting, but the Parrondo effect seemed to me to

</em><br>
<p>I compared it with the investment strategy of asset rebalancing.
<br>
Many investment advisors suggest that you periodically review your asset
<br>
allocation and rebalance it in accordance with your investment strategy.
<br>
For example, if you were 50% in bonds and 50% in stocks, then after a
<br>
while price changes will alter these percentages.  So you would transfer
<br>
assets to bring your allocation back to what you wanted.
<br>
<p>You can show that using asset allocation, with a variety of assets that
<br>
are going up and down somewhat independently, that you can do much better
<br>
than the average gain of each individual asset.  In fact you can make
<br>
money doing this even if all the assets are on a long term downward trend
<br>
(as long as they fluctuate up and down enough).  That's a close analogy
<br>
to Parrondo's trick of making money even on losing games.
