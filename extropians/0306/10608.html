Rafal had asked:
<br>
<em>&gt; Is there a market future on the possibility of AGI 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available on ideafutures?
</em><br>
<p>I believe AGI means &quot;artificial general intelligence&quot;?  Something like
<br>
that?
<br>
<p>There are no claims on the &quot;FX&quot; idea futures game specifically referring
<br>
to this (I'm not sure how it differs from regular AI), but there are some 
<br>
related claims:
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Robbie">http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Robbie</a>
<br>
Claim Robbie - Humanly mobile robot, by 2036
<br>
<p>This claim describes a humanoid robot being in use as a worker in a
<br>
business, consumer service, military, civil service or scientific
<br>
capacity, before the year 2036.  It is trading at 82%.
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=GoCh">http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=GoCh</a>
<br>
Claim GoCh - Machine GO Champion by 2020
<br>
<p>This is one of the oldest FX claims, going back to 1995.  Go is generally
<br>
considered a better test of general intelligence than chess, and computers
<br>
are not very strong players compared to their chess abilities.  It has
<br>
traded mostly in the 40% to 70% range and is now back to the low end,
<br>
at 45%.
<br>
<p><p><a href="http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Tran">http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=Tran</a>
<br>
Claim Tran - Machine Translation by 2015
<br>
<p>This asks for a computer translation program that can go between English
<br>
and one of French, German, Russian, Japanese or Chinese.  The program has
<br>
to produce output equal or better in average quality to a professional
<br>
human translator.  It is another old FX claim and has generally traded
<br>
in the 60% to 80% range, now at 67%.
<br>
<p><p>While none of these claims ask precisely for an AI with fully human
<br>
capabilities, to some extent they would each require approximately
<br>
that level.  The Go claim requires a very high level of ability, but of
<br>
course the problem domain is much simpler.
<br>
<p>If you could come up with a definition of AI (or AGI, whatever), that
<br>
would provide clear criteria for judgement in some time frame, I could
<br>
introduce it as a claim.  Anyone can add claims to the game.
<br>
