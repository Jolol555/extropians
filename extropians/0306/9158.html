</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Nick Bostrom:  &quot;Fifteen percent.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Eliezer Yudkowsky:  &quot;Mine is twenty percent.&quot;

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;Eliezer Yudkowsky:  &quot;I'll keep the twenty.  Here's eight dollars and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;fifty-seven cents.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;And that's how it works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm surprised that your two estimates were so low.  At the time of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conversation, you said that you both knew that the other didn't think it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was their $20 bill, and you had both spent some effort to verify this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; counting the money in your wallets and such.  It's strange that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each thought that there was an 80 to 85 percent chance that the other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person had made a mistake about how much money he had paid, even after he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had gone through the same careful verification procedure that you had.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would have expected that the kind of objective, symmetrical reasoning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required by meta-rationality would lead you to place a greater credibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the statements of the other person.
</em><br>
<p>We did.  We were giving our estimates without taking the other's statement 
<br>
into account, exactly so that we didn't run into your infinite recursion 
<br>
problem.  In other words, since we both knew the other thought that he 
<br>
also hadn't contributed the $20, the real chances were probably somewhere 
<br>
in the vicinity of 50/50.  But to calculate what our actual revised 
<br>
beliefs should be, we had to state what our probabilities were before we 
<br>
started taking the other's probabilities into account.  I don't recall 
<br>
whether this was stated out loud, but it is obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I also wonder how you might have each adjusted your probabilities upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hearing the estimates of the other.  Given that the two probabilities
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to sum to 1, what you basically have is an estimate by Nick of 85%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the bill was Elizer's, and an estimate by Eliezer of 20% for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; same fact.  I believe Robin's result is that upon hearing these estimates,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each of you would adjust his own estimate, and would now expect that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other's adjusted estimate would be about the same as you's.  At least,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you would not be able to predict whether the other person's estimate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was now greater or less than your updated value.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It might have made sense for you to have exchanged a few more estimates.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Chances are you would have converged quickly and been able to split the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; money on that basis.
</em><br>
<p>No, we converged immediately to a probability of 15/35 that the bill was 
<br>
Bostrom's and 20/35 that the bill was mine.
