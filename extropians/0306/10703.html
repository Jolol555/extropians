</em><br>
<em>&gt;of capital is NOT a problem for the average citizen of a TWC. That is a BIG 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;problem. 20K dollars is very hard to come by there. And 20K gives you a lot of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;power in a TWC.  20K in my bank account here makes me no big deal. But 20K in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;India puts me in an elite group.  Now, as someone else pointed out, and to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;which I elaborated, most TWCs are strangled by a parasitic bureaucracy.  This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;**could** be a problem for Americans who wanted to seize upon the opportunity to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;start a business in a TWC.  
</em><br>
<p>...........
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       The point is subtle enough that you and de Soto are not necessarily 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saying the same thing but the distinction is sometimes hard to detect.  De Soto 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is saying that the necessary capital exists in each of those countries to lift 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;them up --
</em><br>
<p>Oh, the capital definitely exists, but not for the average person in a
<br>
TWC.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;       Those bureaucracies you say are strangling countries are in fact 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strangling TW countries and furthermore that is exactly what they were designed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;do.  Our old guild system and the medieval governments were designed to keep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;control in the hands of a favored few.  So are the bureaucracies of the TWCs.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;They keep things in a state so that no outsider can start any kind of a new 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;business.  One of the chief ways they do that in modern terms is to keep 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;individuals from getting clear title to private property.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe....an interesting way to focus in on effect vs. design.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;       The individuals form protective associations to protect their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ownership in their homes or small businesses.  But that is where the problem starts.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;If I cannot get a title to my property then I can't sell or borrow against it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to raise capital to start a new business.  De Soto makes the argument that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this method is the chief way people raise the cash to start a new business.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Nowadays if I want to start a business I can get a mortgage on my house and I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;up, up and away.  A TWC citizen can't do that because he has nothing admissible 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in court to prove ownership.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I work with a man from Venezuela, a country much better off than
<br>
most in S. America, and he just sold a condo he owned there. He told
<br>
me that one thing about owning property there is that you are never
<br>
really sure what you really have.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;       Now, if you please I want to reach way out in left field and pull in a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;personal idea.  Let me put it in the form of a question.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Many have commented that we have a brighter than average group here on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the Extropian list.  Herrnstein in the Bell Curve argues that bright groups 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;like this are coming together all over America.  That is all he had statistics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;for but it seems plain to me that the same is happening in Europe, indeed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;across the globe.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I and others have said that the Net may be the Deus Ex Machina to
<br>
save us from corrupt CorpGovMedia that has all citizens in its grip to
<br>
varying degrees with the possible exception of some of the WEstern
<br>
European countries. The Net may be the cracker barrel/corner
<br>
store/tavern of the small towns, where the citizens were able to make
<br>
the decisions that made sure their govt (at least the local govts)
<br>
worked for them, instead of them working for it.  The Net has the
<br>
potential of remaking every state/nation into a small town.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;       In the old days before a hundred years ago the bright people were 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;scattered through the population according to Herrnstein.  Without getting tied 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;down in an argument about whether he was an adequate statistician ask yourself 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;two questions:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;1.  Do you see sufficient evidence around you to make you believe bright 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people might be communicating with each other more intensely that in the long ago 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;past -- pre 1900 AD?  As I said, I think this is observably true at least as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;trend.
</em><br>
<p>Of course.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;2.  What do you suppose the effect will be of these people congregating in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;places like the Extropy list and exchanging information?  
</em><br>
<p>Not sure how the smart person angle figures into it...
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Once upon a time even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;some very bright people didn't get to converse with a Robin Hanson on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Economics or Investing.  There are other discussions on these pages about longevity, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;health, etc.  I say these discussion will have a profound effect upon people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and eventually our entire civilization.  Have you been exposed to the ideas of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;John Taylor Gatto on public education?  What he says is having a tremendous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;effect for either good or ill and the rest of us had best inform ourselves.
</em><br>
<p><p>Well, for those inclined to read extensively, there were always books
<br>
and libraries before the Net. All of us  on this list grew in
<br>
libraries to a great extent, no doubt.  The effect on the hoi polloi
<br>
is what may cause great change.
