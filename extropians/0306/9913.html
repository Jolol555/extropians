<p><em>&gt; Do You have some kind of reference to things that have been researched

</em><br>
<p>At one time I did but I'm afraid that was quite a few years ago. Several
<br>
academic journals are devoted to the study of financial markets. Those
<br>
journals are filled with statistical evidence for the efficient market
<br>
hypothesis (EMH). I also did my own statistical research, mainly in a
<br>
failed attempt to disprove EMH. 
<br>
<p>I was the options coordinator for my office of Merrill Lynch, meaning
<br>
that I was responsible for overseeing all trading in stock and index
<br>
options in the office, and for training and advising new brokers about
<br>
the subject. I once wrote a program that ran literally for four entire
<br>
days analyzing the complete history of the S+P 100 index (also known as
<br>
the OEX).  My program discovered what appeared to be a small anomaly to
<br>
EMH using a complex formulation of the OEX put/call ratio as an
<br>
indicator. I made some money with it but unfortunately the anomaly
<br>
vanished about six months later, assuming it really existed in the first
<br>
place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like for instance technical analysis patterns etc. (
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i'm quite sure that most well known patterns are of no use whatsoever)
</em><br>
<p>Right. They are of no use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a very hard time getting hold of historic stock data that are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; precise enough to do research on.
</em><br>
<p>I once had the daily history of the Dow Jones Industrials dating back
<br>
almost a century in an Excel spreadsheet. I'm sorry I no longer have it
<br>
and I don't remember how I obtained it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My plan for the next couple of years is somewhat identical to the work
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; you seem to have done previously  - to shoot down as many trading 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategies as possible, and perhaps, if i'm lucky, find a few that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to work.
</em><br>
<p>Good luck. I hate to say it but I think your chances of finding one that
<br>
works is virtually zero. You might find something that appears to work
<br>
for awhile, but don't fall into the trap of believing you've discovered
<br>
a truly valid trading system. I am firmly convinced that no trading
<br>
system can pass a properly designed statistical test. 
<br>
<p>It's a shame that most people in the investment business don't
<br>
understand statistics. If they did understand statistics then they would
<br>
quit and get into a different business, like I did. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Until i have more results, i'll keep investing like i have started 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out. Being long seemingly undervalued stocks, and being short anything
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; real-estate related that is also priced high on book value, earnings 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and has a bad debt/equity ratio.
</em><br>
<p>My advice now, to myself and to my friends and family, is to stay long.
<br>
Never go short and never sell unless you really need the money. Own a
<br>
reasonably but not overly diversified portfolio. In the long run the
<br>
market rewards investors according to the level of risk they take (on
<br>
the long side).
<br>
<p>Despite occasional coughs and hiccups, the world economy is growing and
<br>
there is every reason to believe it will continue to grow. The market
<br>
grows with the world economy. This is all anyone needs to know about the
<br>
market.
