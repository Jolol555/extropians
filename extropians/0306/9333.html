<p>Uh, you mean option (2)?
<br>
<p>Remember, Bostrom is simply arguing that &quot;at least one of the following
<br>
propositions is true:  (1)  the human species is very likely to go extinct
<br>
before reaching a posthuman stage; (2) any posthuman civilization is
<br>
extremely unlikely to run a significant number of simulations of their
<br>
evolutionary history (or variations thereof); (3)  we are almost certainly
<br>
living in a computer simulation. It follows that the belief that there is
<br>
a significant chance that we will one day become posthumans who run
<br>
ancestor-simulations is false, unless we are currently living in a
<br>
simulation. A number of other consequences of this result are also
<br>
discussed.&quot;
<br>
<p>Your claim is in perfect agreement with Bostrom's argument.  Bostrom says
<br>
&quot;1, 2 or 3,&quot; and you say &quot;2.&quot;  If I believe you, then I am of course
<br>
licensed to conclude that at least one of 1, 2 or 3 are true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What if perfect simulations of reality are just as boring as reality and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nobody makes them?  What if perfect simulations are so wonderful that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only people from reality universes migrate into them and very few
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulated people get created?  What if simulations are almost always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed to prevent discovery of the simulations, such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovery-possible simulations are extremely rare?  By assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations are rare, then our circular logic would have to conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that statistically speaking we are likely not to be in a simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Both of these conclusions are circular and lead people to believe what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they want to believe.  There is no data either way to lead anybody into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either conclusion.  Whatever people already believe, that is where their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circular logic will lead them.  There is no statistical support in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either direction.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that all you're saying here is that we don't have enough
<br>
evidence to pick between 2 and 3.
<br>
<p>I see this argument as a criticism of a crucial background assumption of
<br>
the argument: that the key unknowns (f[P] and f[I]) can be estimated,
<br>
within perhaps an order of magnitude (or even just a few orders of
<br>
magnitude).
<br>
<p>For example, you ask: &quot;what if simulations are just as boring as reality
<br>
and nobody makes them?&quot; and I answer: well, what are the odds of that?
<br>
What's f[I]?  .5?  .25?  .1?  I think you'd have to be pretty confident to
<br>
assume that the answer is even one in a hundred, say nothing of
<br>
one-in-a-million or one-in-a-billion, and I don't think we have that kind
<br>
of confidence.
<br>
<p>To the best of our information f[I] isn't much smaller than 0.001, if
<br>
that.  Are you going to try to argue that f[I] is on the order of 1/N[I]?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, I believe their are other counter-examples to the simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Occam's Razor suggests that simpler, more direct explanations are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be correct.  In the absence of data, there is no reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postulate unfalsifiable, hidden, mystical worlds that cannot be detected or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tested.
</em><br>
<p>Here, I think, you have missed the point of this argument.  Many
<br>
transhumanists still seem to believe that *we* will create simulated
<br>
environments, in which it will be impossible for our simulated subjects to
<br>
falsify the claim that they are in a simulation.  This is a solid
<br>
prediction that makes claims about what kinds of worlds there will be:
<br>
namely, that there will be some simulated worlds that we'll make.  Are you
<br>
suggesting that we should reject THAT kind of optimistic transhumanism on
<br>
the basis of Occam's Razor?  I don't see why.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why stop there?  Why not postulate that every religion is true?
</em><br>
<p>Look, if you claimed that each of us would go on to become Gods of our own
<br>
religions, under which it would be possible for people to become Gods of
<br>
their own sub-religions, and so on, I think you'd be out of your gourd if
<br>
you claimed that you yourself are *not* under a God.  If you claimed as
<br>
all this, saying &quot;Sure, according to my theory, most people would be under
<br>
some God, but I'M not&quot;, then arguments like Bostrom's would license us to
<br>
conclude that your prediction/assertion is wrong.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That all fictional stories are real?  That imaginary creatures are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere when we're not looking?  Etc.?
</em><br>
<p>Simulated people are, in their own way, very elaborate fictional/imaginary
<br>
creatures.  In an important sense, these sorts of things are exactly
<br>
what's under discussion, with a non-trivial group of people claiming that
<br>
one day we will have imaginary friends who will be substrate-independent,
<br>
but that we are not ourselves anyone's imaginary friends.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - Theories are supposed to predict observed phenomenon.  This theory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untestable.  It predicts nothing, explains nothing, and provides no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; further information about how the universe works.  Unless some theorized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference between a real universe and a simulated universe can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicted, this theory will never be testable.
</em><br>
<p>Bostrom's simulation argument is a REFUTATION of a specific claim about
<br>
the future: that *we* will go on to simulate people.  Being as it is a
<br>
refutation of a prediction, it is therefore a prediction.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - The very calculation of &quot;more likely to be in a simulation&quot; seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect to me.  To do such a simple calculation we would need real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measurements, and more importantly, some sort of mechanism for counting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes and simulations.  If many-worlds interpretation says there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an infinite number of real universes, how can there be more simulations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than infinity?
</em><br>
<p>Everett's interpretation, often called the &quot;Many-Worlds&quot; Interpretation
<br>
(MWI) doesn't claim that there are an *infinite* number of worlds,
<br>
thankfully.  So, assuming that we only have the huge-but-finite set of
<br>
Everett worlds, counting them (and, more to the point, dividing over them,
<br>
which tends to normalize out the alternative worlds) is in no way
<br>
troublesome.
<br>
<p>Specifically, Bostrom's variable f[P] (fraction of all human-level
<br>
technological civilizations that survive to reach a posthuman stage) gets
<br>
no larger simply by virtue of the fact that there are more
<br>
civilizations... we can still make sense of the FRACTION of such
<br>
civilizations even when there are vastly more such civilizations than we
<br>
might have expected.  (Though, sure, perhaps not if there are an infinite
<br>
number of such civilizations, though even there we could do a great deal
<br>
with a simple measure theory.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If every possible universe exists, wouldn't that include many (or most)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes without simulations?
</em><br>
<p>Yup.  So what?  They get into the denumerator of f[P].
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - As an absurd argument, why not count dreams?  They are simulations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the universe that seem real to us at the time.  There are many more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dreams than universes (either simulated or natural).  Wouldn't this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imply that we are in a dream instead of a simulation or reality?
</em><br>
<p>You've got no substrate-independence in dreams, (dream people being in no
<br>
way on a noetic par with real people,) so Bostrom's argument wouldn't
<br>
apply to dream-people.
<br>
<p>[Or, at least, not to OUR dream-people.  You might say that a posthuman
<br>
civilization is itself a highly sophisticated dream, in which case, yes,
<br>
we could all be in some posthuman's dream.]
<br>
<p>Sleep well,
