<p>Now while a real aircraft carrier is extremely cool, and would earn us

serious extra geek points, something along the lines of this might be more

practical:

<br>
<p>***************
<br>
Casino Cruise Ship built in 1983.
<br>
<p>Passenger accommodation was remodeled in 1997 (including 3 new
<br>
generators).
<br>
<p>Full facilities onboard the vessel include a  jacuzzi, swimming pool,
<br>
casino, health center, beauty parlor, business center, restaurants,
<br>
children's play area, medical clinic, shops, function rooms, etc.
<br>
<p>Specifications: 
<br>
<p>Class LR
<br>
<p>GRT / NRT 8866 / 6000
<br>
<p>Dimensions 127 x 17 x 4.95/4.8 m 
<br>
<p>2 x nkk semp pielstick x 5200 bhp each 
<br>
<p>Cruising speed 18 knots 
<br>
<p>3 x Daihatsu auxiliary engines
<br>
<p>Crew capacity 180 
<br>
<p>Passenger capacity 440 
<br>
<p>107 Staterooms (with a/c, wc/bath, mini-bar, in house movies) and 10
<br>
suites Vessel is continuously maintained and can be inspected in the Far East.
<br>
<p>Asking Price: $12,800,000.00  US
<br>
<p>**************
<br>
<p><p>Yes, it is almost three times the price...but it needs almost no refitting
<br>
to be immediately usable, and it wouldn't suprise me that getting that
<br>
carrier into usable shape would cost at least that much. 
<br>
<p>No, you wouldn't be able to have 1000 people aboard, but a couple hundred
<br>
would fit comfortably.  You wouldn't have the large flight deck, but a
<br>
helo deck could be easily added.  The sand beach wouldn't be very large,
<br>
but the jacuzzi is already installed. 
<br>
<p>The space currently devoted to the casino could be built into the clinic
<br>
and lab space.  Might just pay for itself.
<br>
<p>It worked for L. Ron Hubbard, it could work for us...
