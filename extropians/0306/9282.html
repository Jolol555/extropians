</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Depends on what you mean. According to Mohandas Gandhi, armed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; revolt was a possibility he kept firmly in mind. That he wound up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; emphasizing nonviolence doesn't mean it wasn't also on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt; Viceroy's mind.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; He said that non-violence was for the really strong and was the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; superior method but that it was better for those less strong to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take up arms than to simply acquiesce to that which is wrong.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also want to point out, in response to the original poser, that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indian populace was armed--with an idea. And other arms were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; available as an additional resort. Call that amphigory if you want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  to.
</em><br>
<p>They were also armed with history. The British had already dealt with
<br>
one significant mutiny on the subcontinent, the Sepoy Mutiny, which
<br>
resulted in the deaths of many british civilians, and were mindful of
<br>
the fact that the Indians were quite capable of fighting severely to
<br>
attain liberty. By the 1930s-40s, the British just didn't think it was
<br>
worth the bother to have to deal with another mutiny which this time
<br>
would have been led by a truly charismatic individual rather than just
<br>
a random mob-based revolt as the Sepoy Mutiny was.
<br>
<p>Ghandi knew this, and thus knew that violence was simply unnecessary.
<br>
By the time Lord Mountbatten was made Viceroy of India, the British
<br>
Government was entirely behind the idea of Indian independence, and
<br>
selected him specifically because of that policy. His primary job as
<br>
Viceroy was to attain a peaceful transition, and his wife became best
<br>
of freinds not only with Ghandi but his successor as well.
