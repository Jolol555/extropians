Omard stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hardly.  most practicing muslims are sunni; and sunni's are permitted 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (encouraged and required) to read and interpret the koran to the best of their 
</em><br>
abilities.  And while fatwah's are binding in the sense that they
<br>
represent the current consensus in regards to the correct interpretation of a 
<br>
surrah or hadith, there are in fact several schools of interpretation... each 
<br>
muslim has his or her own preference for which school of thought most
<br>
closely parallels his or her particular interpretation of the religion..&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>This does not explain or justify (I will exclude Shia for brevity) the 
<br>
Nigerian antagonisms because of Sharia. Indonesian Muslims, anti-Christian, 
<br>
anti-Aussie attacks, the oppression and war against Chrisitans and Animists in Sudan, 
<br>
which has cost 2 million lives, and the world is silent about, the Salafists 
<br>
in North Africa, the Wahabbists and 9-11, the Taleban in Afghanistan, (I will 
<br>
ignore the Israel situation for brevity too), the war against the Indians from 
<br>
Sunii Pakistan, the attack on the USS Cole, the Khobar towers, the attack on 
<br>
the Trade Towers in 93..on and on. Whatever principles Islam stands for, its 
<br>
not living up to the better ones. It isn't the religion, but the social culture 
<br>
which it tolerates. 
<br>
<p>Almost all religions have these unfortunate qualities in them, but right now 
<br>
Islam has been cursed with a fanaticism, (funded by oil) based on the 
<br>
insecurities which modern science and culture have brought us. We cannot seem to 
<br>
continue to do things in the same old ways of tribe and tradition, and the US with 
<br>
its culture undermines the old ways of thinking. The trouble is with both 
<br>
Christianity and Islam, is that if one goes onto a new path, one is 
<br>
psychologically threatened with oblivion after death, or an eternal hell. The better path, 
<br>
has been suggested by only one physicist, and one robotics engineer (a 
<br>
polymath), but nobody else is interested in this answer. But (for brevity) that is 
<br>
another thread, and perhaps some other (imaginary) mailing list.
