Mea culpa mea maxima culpa. But my flaws don't affect millions of people, do 
<br>
they?
<br>
<p>Dr. R. Hanson:
<br>
&lt;&lt;It seems to me that you are the most conservative investor there is; you 
<br>
invest all of your income in immediate consumption.  You want your returns 
<br>
so immediate that there is not time to invest them at all.  And then you 
<br>
criticize other investors, who actually take a chance by putting their 
<br>
income into ventures that may or may not be successful, saying they should 
<br>
take even more chances than they do.  Ever hear of the mote in another's eye?&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>After viewing the behavior of most of the big corporations, with overstating 
<br>
by billions the worth of their stocks; Xerox, WorldCom, TYCO, ENRON, EDS, and 
<br>
the accounting firms that helped them, I suddenly don't feel so sinful. 
<br>
Watching the hundreds of thousands of Information Technology jobs, that have been, 
<br>
and are being Off-Shored (A phenomena that an economist might be interested 
<br>
in), one can see why there is no recovery, despite multiple interest rate cuts by 
<br>
Greenspan's Fed. And the folks who obtain these jobs at 1/10th the pay rate 
<br>
that Americans do, cannot afford to purchase goods and services produced by 
<br>
American-based firms. They are essentially outside the American economy, and thus 
<br>
no American benefits-except the few who sit on boards of directors and tell 
<br>
each other how much money they've saved.
<br>
<p>My point is that the same dorks who sit on the boards of directors, and have 
<br>
lied to stockholders over stock value; who send high paying technical jobs 
<br>
overseas, and thus undermine the American middle class, for short-term benefits, 
<br>
don't give a care about technical development, (Plasma Tech in this case) 
<br>
because hey, if ya can't dazzle em' with brains, baffle em' with b.s.  As Herman 
<br>
Melville wrote of his 1851 work, Moby Dick; &quot;I have written a wicked book, and 
<br>
feel blameless as the Lamb..&quot;
<br>
:-)
