-Who decides when military action is not taken, when it is called for? 
<br>
-You are concerned that the CIC is a religious fundamentalist. The irony is 
<br>
that said fundamentalist had to ask his Mom whether, myself, as a member of a 
<br>
certain group whether I was going to hell  &gt;;)   His Mom directed the future 
<br>
prez to have a chat with Billy Graham for answers. If I am not pestered by the 
<br>
prez's religious affiliations, crazy white boy that you are, why should you be 
<br>
:-) ??  
<br>
<p>If Iraq breaks up into religious geographic sections, why should this trouble 
<br>
you? As far as the idea that the dog is being wagged by the Republican tail, 
<br>
kindly imagine what a 12 kiloton yield nuke detonating in central DC will have 
<br>
on this list, the economy, the country, the world. Then, you really will have 
<br>
a dictatorship to worry about, if you're lucky. Also, count the USA out as a 
<br>
participant is space exploration, and scientific pursuits. 
<br>
<p>The chance option for retaliation against a radical Islamic group, who 
<br>
doesn't mind dying for Allah, would be really low in the case of nuclear guerilla 
<br>
warfare, unless such as option is already in place, with suspected targets 
<br>
already identified. You, indeed are here as part of a civilization that is being 
<br>
targeted for attack. Now what is the best way we can defend it? The question of 
<br>
targeting is not paranoia, the wisest response is. Denial is not an option, 
<br>
for either of us.

<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;I -If NO military action is taken when called for, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If military action is/was taken and bystanders become more polarized, 
<br>
grievous.
<br>
<p>-If grasping abusive shortsighted people subjugate others, grievous-- 
<br>
whether they're thug-protected corporations or simple gun-bearing thugs.
<br>
<p>-If Iraq collapses into Shi'ite Shariya, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If the actions taken by the US contribute to instability, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If the US uses such instability to justify further incursions (&quot;Hey, look, 
<br>
we tried, but them camel jockeys just aren't ready for anything but 
<br>
subjugaton...&quot;) with a further net bad effect, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If those who claim to speak for the US continue to spin, oversimplify and 
<br>
misrepresent things, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If the media continue to pump up the US population as easily spooked 
<br>
fragile victims, grievous.&gt;&gt;
