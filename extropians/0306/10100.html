Gary,

<br>
Could these solar ponds be multipurpose say for Aquaculture (fish
<br>
farms).  We are being told that fishing yields are way down.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If this acreage could be architected to perform a dual purpose of food
<br>
production and energy production it could be made even more
<br>
cost effective besides fish is healthier than steak anyway.

<p><p>I am a big fan of methane-based energy and look favorably on biomass
<br>
too. Are these solar ponds sealed from the environment with lexan
<br>
plastic, which would keep out dust, fungus, rain, grass, bird droppings,
<br>
and insects? How much methane, in cubic feet could these ponds produce?
<br>
Enough to power a 100 million car fleet? Could the methane be converted
<br>
to methanol or should vehicles be run on CNG? Would such a technology be
<br>
&quot;blown out of the saddle&quot; with competition from Alaskan natural gas, or
<br>
the development of methane hydrates from clathrate oceanic sources?
<br>

<br>
<p><p>Robert Bradbury stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Actually there is a solution very close to that.  Creating methane in
<br>
solar ponds using engineered bacteria, put into the existing pipeline
<br>
system, sent to retooled refineries that convert it into propane or
<br>
octane, perhaps using some power from spike's windmills.  Converting
<br>
short
<br>
chain hydrocarbons into longer chain hydrocarbons I don't believe is
<br>
particularly difficult (though I'm not a chemist).  The hard part
<br>
(currently) is having a sufficient quantity of the short chain
<br>
hydrocarbons (which are currently all being pumped out of the ground
<br>
rather than manufactured above ground).
<br>
<p>You have to use a significant fraction of the rangeland in the U.S.
<br>
southwest, but if my numbers are correct the economics seem *very*
<br>
