Well...having 'lurked' on a few threads without joining in recently, 
<br>
although the afterburn lingers long enough to make me nervous about 
<br>
joining in this one, I do feel there is a more positive and realistic 
<br>
outlook on the list now than at anytime in the last 2 years.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I tried in the beginning to correct what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;errors I saw, but it became an enormous chore. The answer for me is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to not respond to what little that I read that misrepresents me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

There are a lot of very clever people on this list. By 'clever' I mean 
<br>
they know a lot of facts, are competent in maths and the sciences, take 
<br>
an interest in world (or at least US) affairs, and are very very good at 
<br>
the sort of skills that enable us to pass IQ tests.
<br>
There is another organisation which is fairly similar to the extropians. 
<br>
It is MENSA. One can join (subject to that all-important IQ, of course), 
<br>
and, similarly, discuss matters of religion, politics, ethics and logic, 
<br>
as well as special interest groups for sci-fi., bird-watching or whatever.
<br>
The two lists have a lot in common. 1. There is a subset of people who 
<br>
think they are more intelligent than people with low IQ. They are not. 
<br>
They are just more clever. 2. There is a subset of people who think that 
<br>
religion and/or politics are a great deal more important than scientific 
<br>
evidence would imply. They are not. They are just louder. Subset 2 in 
<br>
both groups has something in common. Roughly 80% of its members are 
<br>
unprofessional, rude, immature, emotionally challenged, and insecure in 
<br>
that arrogant, derogatory way which only facile cleverness can accomplish.
<br>
These people have a great ability to construct arguments in complex 
<br>
networks of semantics. They can do almost anything with words in the 
<br>
same way that you can prove almost anything with numbers and statistics, 
<br>
regardless of its truth. What matters to them is not the issue under 
<br>
discussion, whatever it is; what matters to them is polishing their egos 
<br>
and saying 'I am right. Mine is the superior intellect.' These people 
<br>
treat their Left Hemispheres like Arnie treats his muscles, 
<br>
unfortunately at the expense of the midbrain and frontal cortex. There 
<br>
is not a scrap of creative intellect available to them and they never 
<br>
actually _do_ anything. They talk and talk and criticise a lot, yet seem 
<br>
unable to plan, construct or achieve anything concrete or even in 
<br>
imagination (which may be the problem). They are, to put it kindly, 
<br>
'emotionally challenged'.
<br>
Remember I am talking about a subset here; not the whole group. You 
<br>
'do-ers' know who you are. Without you, we are all lost  :  )
<br>
What matters is that in both groups, subset two is the noisy part. The 
<br>
whole group gets misrepresented as subset two jumps on every topic and 
<br>
every discussion and reduces it to toilet level. Serious debaters 
<br>
vanish, if they've got any sense, the moment unprofessional, immature 
<br>
behavior starts hitting the fan. Anyone with any degree of intelligence 
<br>
cannot help but notice stupidity.
<br>
Harvey and Amara's comments are both timely and enlightning. I attempted 
<br>
to make this point about a year ago but my comments were mistaken for an 
<br>
attempt at censorship. Censorship is not necessary wherever discussion 
<br>
is civilised.
<br>
It's about time we took responsibility for these memes that are being 
<br>
connected with us in the public eye, without our apparent knowledge or 
<br>
consent. If the ExI list content could actually work _against_ us in 
<br>
relation to the singularity, what are we doing? said Pooh, scratching 
<br>
his head and walking around in circles...
