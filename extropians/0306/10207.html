I wrote this a few weeks ago and decided not to post it
<br>
but since there is a debate in the investing thread I'll throw
<br>
my questions in.
<br>
<p>First, are insider trading laws about what is widely known
<br>
or what is widely available to be known?  If most anyone
<br>
could get the information is that good enough?
<br>
<p>I know the common wisdom is that one can not outdo the
<br>
market without insider information but it does not make
<br>
sense to me.  Scientist figure out things other people
<br>
do not know with information that is widely available to
<br>
everyone.  It seems like one could also figure out which
<br>
companies are over or under valued by the market given
<br>
sufficient diligence.
<br>
<p>Of course, prices reflect some insider information.  And I
<br>
can imagine that sufficient diligence might automatically net
<br>
you inside information.
<br>
<p>But not everyone's reasoning powers, business savvy, etc.
<br>
is the same.  I would think one might deal with insider
<br>
trading laws by simply announcing publicly what one
<br>
intends to do and why.  Most people can not follow or
<br>
will disagree with good arguments they are unfamiliar with.
<br>
At that point it's public info but you can still take advantage
<br>
of it.
<br>
<p>I suspect something is wrong with these arguments but
<br>
I'm not sure what.  Why is the stock market so much
<br>
more reasonable and efficient than science, politics, and
<br>
all of the other human endeavors in which I know people
<br>
are often ignorant?  Is it simply that there are enough
<br>
smart, reasonable people working the market so that
<br>
any advantage is quickly and widely distributed.  That
<br>
would still leave the possibility of market genius but would
<br>
make it difficult.  Or is it that most people smart enough in
<br>
the right way to make money in the market can make more
<br>
money inventing things or starting companies?
<br>
<p>Perhaps dumb money quickly gets gobbled up.  A small
<br>
number of people with a lot of money affect the market
<br>
more than many small investors.  The money will repeatedly
<br>
be transferred to savvy investors so that they end up competing
<br>
against each other.  That makes sense to me but goes against
<br>
the idea that one can't out do the market.  If we say one can
<br>
not out perform the market that suggests the people who make
<br>
a lot in the market are all just lucky.  Not sure I buy that.
<br>
Could be but it's a funny work view.  With such a view I
<br>
would expect people rich from stocks and people rich from
<br>
lotto or Las Vegas to have similar financial ability.  People
<br>
rich from stocks seem to do better or is that just part of
<br>
the Wall Street advertising.  Or is it just that all of the rich
<br>
people who do well in stocks break the rules (or got lucky).
<br>
<p>Ah well, interesting stuff but I'm not to money yet.

<em>&gt; &gt; Consider it this way:  Selling stock to someone else is a sales
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transaction of property.  You are offering to sell a known commodity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that is described by public disclosure statements.  If you know those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; statements are false due to insider information, and you sell the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; product to a buyer who believes those public disclosures are true, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have cheated the buyer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes I know that argument. I spent more than a decade as a licensed general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; securities broker, and like you I also have an education in business,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including business law. I know all the regulations and the theories behind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them. I was bound by those regulations for many years. Fortunately I am no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; longer in the investment business, so I can speak freely. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just to be clear, we are not talking about fraudulent public disclosures
</em><br>
by
<br>
<em>&gt; the company, which are and should be a crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We are talking about private investors profiting from new information
</em><br>
about
<br>
<em>&gt; a company obtained before that new information is widely publicized. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example you might obtain knowledge that the next earnings report from XYZ
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Corp is going to be higher than expected. Should you profit from that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knowledge by buying stock in XYZ? The law says no. It is legal to act on a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *guess* but not on a *fact*. The only exception is when everyone already
</em><br>
has
<br>
<em>&gt; access to that fact, in which case there is no excess profit to be gained
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from your knowledge of the fact as it is already discounted in the stock
</em><br>
<em>&gt; price.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the market should be seen as a competition between investors to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; acquire and act on the most profitable information, such that &quot;cheating
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; buyer&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;out-competing the buyer.&quot; After all, you
</em><br>
are
<br>
<em>&gt; attempting to &quot;cheat the buyer&quot; any time you sell a stock because you
</em><br>
think
<br>
<em>&gt; it's going to drop in price. You are hoping someone less savvy than you
</em><br>
will
<br>
<em>&gt; buy it from you and take a bath in it instead of you. This element of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;criminal intent&quot; is present regardless of how you arrived at your
</em><br>
negative
<br>
<em>&gt; forecast of the stock price.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In theory the market should be a game in which superior knowledge about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies buys the investor a superior return over the market averages. It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should be a game in which the investor who knows the most, makes the most.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is after all the way most US investors *think* the market works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Investors and their brokers and analysts all operate on the (false)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumption that good knowledge gained from public sources will buy one an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excess return in the market. This belief is what drives the market. But it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is not the way the US markets work *in reality*. The US markets are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efficient and regulated that knowledge buys one absolutely nothing unless
</em><br>
it
<br>
<em>&gt; is so-called &quot;inside&quot; knowledge, in which case Uncle Sam says it's a
</em><br>
crime.
<br>
<em>&gt; And that problem is exactly what I'm railing against. It is in effect a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crime in the US to have more knowledge about a company than the investor
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; the other end of the transaction. You can *pretend* to yourself that you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have access to more and better knowledge than the other guy, and this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exactly what Wall Street *wants* you to think, but if you actually *do*
</em><br>
have
<br>
<em>&gt; access to such superior knowledge then you're looking at a prison
</em><br>
sentence.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As I mentioned, this is not the case in every country. Taiwan has a
</em><br>
vibrant
<br>
<em>&gt; stockmarket but they have no insider trading laws (last time I checked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway, which was admittedly quite some years ago). In Taiwan, the game
</em><br>
<em>&gt; works the way it should work: investors who know the most, make the most.
</em><br>
In
<br>
<em>&gt; Taiwan it pays to do your homework. Smart, knowledgeable investors make
</em><br>
more
<br>
<em>&gt; money than dumb, ignorant investors. That is the way it ought to be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But studies show that in the US, knowledge obtained through conventional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; public means buys one absolutely nothing. One might just as well throw
</em><br>
darts
<br>
<em>&gt; at the newspaper to pick stocks. This is a primary reason that I got out
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; the business ten years ago: after spending more than 12 years in the game,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and after doing some in-depth statistical research, I realized to my great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappointment that *public knowledge is worthless*. So-called inside
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information has value, but the rules make its use a crime.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The business section of the newspaper is an interesting story about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drama of American business but otherwise it's just a waste of trees.
</em><br>
