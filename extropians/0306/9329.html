</em><br>
<p>I'm no expert in this, but it seems to have a lot to do with two factors:
<br>
traditional publishers being gobbled up by vast global corporations which
<br>
apply book/reader-unfriendly protocols to selling their wares, and the use
<br>
of instant computer assessment by distributors of sales at major points of
<br>
sale like airports, supermarkets and book chain outlets. Here's what I
<br>
wrote the other day in my forthcoming book about sf, *x, y, z, t*:
<br>
<p>==============
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Today, fifty years on, sophisticated print sf teeters, perhaps, on the
<br>
edge of extinction. In 2001, Asimov's editor and writer Gardner Dozois
<br>
recalled his 1995 trip to a World SF Convention in Glasgow:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;the British science fiction industry is in ruins... One well-known
<br>
middle-level British writer says that the only way he can get a science
<br>
fiction book into print in Britain any more is by disguising it as fantasy,
<br>
changing what otherwise would have been aliens into vampires and
<br>
werewolves.&quot; (2001, 74)
<br>
<p>Yet the book traders, Dozois notes, told him that customers complain that
<br>
they are sick of Celtic trilogies and horror, and crave sf instead.
<br>
`Something is wrong here somewhere. But if the perception of the publishers
<br>
that no one wants to read science fiction is wrong, there seems no way to
<br>
convince the publishers of it' (74). Can publishers get it so wrong?
<br>
Apparently so, due to their reliance on marketing tools appropriate to
<br>
selling soap and peanuts and gasoline. Computer systems now routinely track
<br>
book sales, effectively in real time, across chain outlets. Any item that
<br>
sells less than the mean is pulled quickly and pulped. New authors and
<br>
others trying something fresh and disconcerting vanish like the dew; their
<br>
names are poisoned for their next submission. Mega-corporations seek
<br>
certified bestsellers; authors strive to become safe brand names. Brian
<br>
Stableford, premier sociologist of sf, observed some years ago:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;In the busiest outlets-like those in airports, which are browsed by
<br>
hundreds of people per hour-the rates of sale can be measured so quickly
<br>
that many titles need only be displayed for a matter of hours before it
<br>
becomes clear that the rational decision is to replace them with something
<br>
else... Given the tendency of paperback publishers to overproduce and the
<br>
existence of the sale-or-return convention, it was inevitable that
<br>
publishers would find their returns coming back much more quickly and much
<br>
more prolifically... [W]hile the print-runs of paperbacks remained fairly
<br>
steady the sales of all but a tiny fraction-almost certainly less than
<br>
10%-suffered a precipitous collapse. By 1990... almost all of these
<br>
low-advance titles were failing to earn out those advances or make any
<br>
profit at all for their publishers.&quot; (Stableford, 2000, 47-8).
<br>
<p>This fall into nescience by the marketing conglomerates has only
<br>
accelerated, and afflicts all publishing, but marginal modes such as
<br>
science fiction are especially at risk. It is possible that sf published
<br>
beyond the borders of the United States, with its distinctive contribution
<br>
to the expansive and liberating dimensions of the mode, might soon perish
<br>
entirely.
