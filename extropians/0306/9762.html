<p>
To M. Dickey, J. Clark and Ron h:
<br>
<p><p>I refuse talking or discussing with anyone of you any of your arguments,
<br>
especially those of Michael Dickey, in detail. It would be a complete waste
<br>
of time for both sides. Our views are not compatible. I only want to remind
<br>
you from time to time that your violent world view still looks disgusting to
<br>
a freelancing transhuman - but not necessarily *extropian* - guest here on
<br>
this list who thinks the whole entropic side effect and expenditure of
<br>
blowing away heat and sweat into the universe in the process of bringing up
<br>
some non-violent arguments that the patriots here finally do not appreciate
<br>
anyway, is in itself a pretty unextropian process of communication. We will
<br>
never come together and I can easily live with this prospect :-)
<br>
<p>One word to Ron h: I don't feel being a loser at all. But confronted with
<br>
the concentrated winner attitude here on the list, I feel sympathy for the
<br>
losers and remember the artistic concept of &quot;being allowed to fail&quot; without
<br>
being despised.
<br>
<p><p>Maybe I am not as brilliant as any one of you followers of violent fashion
<br>
are. Maybe your exorbitantly gifted minds are already too close to mind
<br>
blowing ideas all the time to understand my non-brilliant message. Anyway,
<br>
what I was basically trying to communicate to you was this:
<br>
<p><p>If in June 2003 you are still on the same level as your fellow republican US
<br>
politicians while dealing with ultra conservative monkey business like
<br>
territorial pissings with funnily talking Arabs who stubbornly deny wearing
<br>
blue jeans and display this strange effeminate outfit while unexpectedly
<br>
rejecting the American way of life altogether, could it be that your
<br>
Pentagon- and-White-House-dominated thinking in union with adrenalin-aided
<br>
visualisations of smashing those Middle Eastern bastards which amplifies the
<br>
already existing territorial bullshit in your brain and - in connection with
<br>
an artificially produced feeling of helplessness and lack of security -
<br>
evokes a cry for a Rumsfeldian solution and thus leads to an endlessly
<br>
intensified vicious circle of astonishingly flexible ancient lizard brain
<br>
circuits that spread the message towards the cortex to merely defend
<br>
American borders between Kairo and Teheran and boosts
<br>
testosterone-contaminated mammal behaviour which finally leads to a general
<br>
regress of brain quality as well, are a bit too one-dimensional to be called
<br>
transhuman - or extropian, if you like?
<br>
<p><p>Grammatical help: the nouns that &quot;one-dimensional&quot; refers to, are &quot;thinking&quot;
<br>
and &quot;visualisations&quot;. Sorry for my bad English. I wish I could write in
<br>
German.
<br>
<p><p>Just an impression and not really a question from
<br>
<p><p>humania
<br>
