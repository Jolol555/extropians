<em>&gt; These observations are based both on theory and practice.  I studied

<p>On the other hand, there have been statistical studies done that do show 
<br>
that based on rather simple metrics like market P/E, a buy &amp; hold 
<br>
portfolio over a long term (10 years or more) holding period has 
<br>
somewhat predictable performance. Based on historical data, it would be 
<br>
predictable that investing at high P/Es (BTW, the markets are still at a 
<br>
high P/E) greatly increases the odds your portfolio will experience a 
<br>
long term no-growth or negative-growth performance from stocks.
<br>
<p>Here's one example, there are others out there:

<p><a href="http://www.kc.frb.org/PUBLICAT/ECONREV/PDF/4q00shen.pdf">http://www.kc.frb.org/PUBLICAT/ECONREV/PDF/4q00shen.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>(It's also fun to note that this was written back in 2000 apparently, 
<br>
and even then this economist was still &quot;drinking the bubble kool-aid&quot;. 
<br>
Heck, I even have a saved post by ultra-rational Robin Hanson from June 
<br>
2000 where he also wasn't quite sure if we were in a bubble. Makes me 
<br>
feel at least a bit less peeved with myself :-/)
<br>
<p>Anyway, besides the P/E stuff, there also is some statistical evidence 
<br>
for at least one set of market performance cycles... if you combine that 
<br>
with what, as technology futurists, we expect to see in the coming 
<br>
years, it is quite likely we are indeed in the deflationary bear market 
<br>
chunk of the cycle, which very well may continue on for the next 10 
<br>
years or so. Even during such parts of the cycle though, the market has 
<br>
as many or more up years than down years, but don't expect any kind of 
<br>
significant returns during this period from a LTB&amp;H approach unless you 
<br>
are holding securities that provide you a fixed rate of return.
