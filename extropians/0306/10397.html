<p>This is a much more complex question than it looks.  The standard Bayesian 
<br>
formalism uses a static utility function or an environmental reward 
<br>
channel, which from my perspective makes the standard formalism an 
<br>
oversimplified special case.  Before you can even get started on talking 
<br>
about moral computations, you need to replace the usual simplification 
<br>
with (a) a bounded Bayesian wannabe instead of a logically omniscient 
<br>
entity; and (b) make the Bayesian reflective and capable of at least some 
<br>
kinds of self-modification, rather than dividing it off from the universe 
<br>
by a sharp Cartesian boundary.  Then, once you've done that, you need to 
<br>
replace the static utility function by a complex unfinished computation, 
<br>
perhaps with external dependencies that need to be reasoned about via 
<br>
Bayesian sensory evidence, or containing complex internal questions, such 
<br>
that, although the answers are computationally deterministic, only 
<br>
probabilistic approximations are cheap enough to compute - i.e., primes 
<br>
versus pseudoprimes.
<br>
<p>If you do this, you can talk about two entities which evolved so as to 
<br>
inherit similar, but not exact, complex unfinished computations as their 
<br>
utility functions, and natures which include specific procedures for how 
<br>
to argue with other such entities.  Such entities, when they disagree 
<br>
about desirable actions, may not know whether their disagreement is about 
<br>
unknown external facts, different approximations to deterministic internal 
<br>
computational results, or genuinely different utility computations.
<br>
<p>Ideal perfect Bayesians, if they disagree about to whom a piece of real 
<br>
estate belongs, will know their disagreement is about values.  Humans 
<br>
cannot &quot;firmly&quot; disagree about values because they do not know firmly what 
<br>
their own values are, and furthermore, do not know which components of the 
<br>
complex computation are of the cannot-agree-to-disagree class.  This is 
<br>
why moral argument even exists in the first place.
