<p>At a nearby table with three similar-looking clones:
<br>
<p>&quot;Who's that?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;One of the regulars. I think he gives the place a wonderful
<br>
atmosphere.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;So much despair... I find it hard to imagine that kind of
<br>
state.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Maybe because the way you... *we* are wired. But I think he
<br>
has a point.  Notice that skulking avatar in the corner?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The one with the wobbly feelers?&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes. He is going to get vaguely guilty and leave.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;OK, that is an improvement. 
<br>
<p>&quot;And the luddite spy caumoflaged as a bush-robot - I mean, how
<br>
obvious can you get? - he is going back to his homesite and
<br>
gloat about how impotent we are.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;While there is real work being done on the outside.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yeah. I assume there is.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Actually, the big problem is keeping multiple perspectives. On
<br>
one hand we have a lot of past that actually amounts to
<br>
impressive human achievement, on the other hand it really is
<br>
next to nothing and certainly no reason to be proud. And the
<br>
future is both empty and filled with the grandest visions.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Makes me happy I'm a clone.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Me too.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Me too. But the issue of motivation and inspiration is still
<br>
real. We need motivation to actually do things, and inspiration
<br>
from somewhere to do it.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Some people are motivated by others, like being in good
<br>
standing with the crowd.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But how boring is that? Besides, if you only do things because
<br>
others like them you are their slave. One should do what one
<br>
likes, regardless of others.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Spoken like a true individualist clone.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Yes, but we all agree anyway. This place might be good for
<br>
inspiration, but I doubt it is a good motivator.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And an even lousier place to work in.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Say that to the RoboTender - look at the tips he is raking
<br>
in.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;You know what I mean. Some people get their best ideas here,
<br>
even meet their significant others, but making them real is an
<br>
individual project best done outside.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And sober.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I like the place for the people.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;And who cares who they are outside, or how old they are. What 
<br>
really matters is what ideas and interactions we contribute 
<br>
here.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;I lost the count of who of us are who.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Who cares? Let's order Harv some extra drinks.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;But this time, let's make it a prime number.&quot;
<br>
<p><p>[Just a homage to a great original!]
