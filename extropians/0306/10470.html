</em><br>
<em>&gt;mean they know a lot of facts, are competent in maths and the sciences, take 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;an interest in world (or at least US) affairs, and are very very good at the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;sort of skills that enable us to pass IQ tests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Alex,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Let me back away from your position just a little to recall what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Herrnstein and Serebriakoff said that seems to me to be applicable to this list and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the heat that is generated here.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Herrnstein claims there is evidence that since about 1900 AD the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;clever Hi IQ types have slowly been coming into community.  I think Mensa, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Extropian list and lots of other evidence is indicative that Herrnstein was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Second, Victor Serebriakoff was saying back in the 60s that when a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bunch of Hi IQ types get together they behave badly.  They are not used to being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around those as clever as themselves and behave badly when they can't dominate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;anyone with their intellectual agility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Given what we observe on the list why shouldn't I assume that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Serebriakoff and Herrnstein are correct?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       Let me give a minor example: we have a thread called &quot;Dishonest debate 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(was Cluster Bombs)&quot;  I haven't looked up the origins of that thread name but 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I will bet you that the guy or gal that changed that name didn't do it to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;warn us of his dishonest tactics.  In fact I will hazard a guess that he or she 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was involved in the debate called &quot;cluster bombs&quot; and changed the name while he 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;was losing the debate called &quot;cluster bombs.&quot;  I'll let you look it up and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;you can be the judge, Alex.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;       In my view the arguments and the dishonest manipulation of threads 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;through name changes serves the Serebriakoff purpose.  Immature people are being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;given an opporturnity to vent their spleen and learn how to behave in polite 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;society.  Alex, I'll let you be the judge of that also -- think about it for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;awhile and watch.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Ron h.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;No, I don't know who made that change, hope it wasn't me.  &lt;G&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
