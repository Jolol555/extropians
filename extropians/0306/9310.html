<p>
The Simulation Argument is silly.  It is circular logic.  First, you must
<br>
assume that there are more simulations than realities.  Then, you conclude
<br>
that since there are more simulations than realities, it is statistically
<br>
likely that we are in one of them.
<br>
<p>But what if we don't conclude that there are more simulations?  What if
<br>
simulations are rare?  What if perfect simulations of reality are just as
<br>
boring as reality and nobody makes them?  What if perfect simulations are so
<br>
wonderful that only people from reality universes migrate into them and very
<br>
few simulated people get created?  What if simulations are almost always
<br>
programmed to prevent discovery of the simulations, such that
<br>
discovery-possible simulations are extremely rare?  By assuming that
<br>
simulations are rare, then our circular logic would have to conclude that
<br>
statistically speaking we are likely not to be in a simulation.
<br>
<p>Both of these conclusions are circular and lead people to believe what they
<br>
want to believe.  There is no data either way to lead anybody into either
<br>
conclusion.  Whatever people already believe, that is where their circular
<br>
logic will lead them.  There is no statistical support in either direction.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I believe their are other counter-examples to the simulation
<br>
universe:
<br>
<p>- Occam's Razor suggests that simpler, more direct explanations are more
<br>
likely to be correct.  In the absence of data, there is no reason to
<br>
postulate unfalsifiable, hidden, mystical worlds that cannot be detected or
<br>
tested.  Why stop there?  Why not postulate that every religion is true?
<br>
That all fictional stories are real?  That imaginary creatures are
<br>
everywhere when we're not looking?  Etc.?
<br>
<p>- Theories are supposed to predict observed phenomenon.  This theory is
<br>
untestable.  It predicts nothing, explains nothing, and provides no further
<br>
information about how the universe works.  Unless some theorized difference
<br>
between a real universe and a simulated universe can be predicted, this
<br>
theory will never be testable.
<br>
<p>- The very calculation of &quot;more likely to be in a simulation&quot; seems suspect
<br>
to me.  To do such a simple calculation we would need real measurements, and
<br>
more importantly, some sort of mechanism for counting universes and
<br>
simulations.  If many-worlds interpretation says there are an infinite
<br>
number of real universes, how can there be more simulations than infinity?
<br>
If every possible universe exists, wouldn't that include many (or most)
<br>
universes without simulations?
<br>
<p>- As an absurd argument, why not count dreams?  They are simulations of the
<br>
universe that seem real to us at the time.  There are many more dreams than
<br>
universes (either simulated or natural).  Wouldn't this imply that we are in
<br>
a dream instead of a simulation or reality?
