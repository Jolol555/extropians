Damien Broderick had replied to me:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Had I ever made the extraordinary claim that the hideous Saddam Hussein
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regime was bloodless, I'd expect to be pulled up short. Why is it so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difficult to grasp this?
</em><br>
<p>To which Harvey Newstrom illuminatingly contributed:
<br>
<p>&quot;It's binary thinking.  (Saddam = Evil) = (Bush = Good).  If you question 
<br>
(Bush = Good) then you must mean that Bush is 100% Evil and
<br>
Saddam is an angel.&quot;
<br>
<p>If you had taken a moment to step off the Condescension Express, Mr. 
<br>
Newstrom, you might have noticed that I never once mentioned President Bush in my 
<br>
original reply to Damien. It was Damien who chose to use the phrase &quot;oily 
<br>
omelette&quot; in his harsh response to Spike. He thus turned what one might consider a 
<br>
legitimate point (lack of depictions of war dead and casualities in the book) 
<br>
into an unnecessary &quot;cheap shot&quot; at the American administration.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I have never read a post of Damien's in which he refers to a Vietnamese 
<br>
Communist &quot;re-education camp omelette&quot;, a Castro or Mengistu's &quot;famine omelette&quot;, 
<br>
or even a Saddam Hussein's &quot;oily omelette&quot;. The crude criticism is reserved 
<br>
solely for the Bush administration. This is even more appalling when one 
<br>
considers that every civilian life lost in Iraq could've been saved had Saddam 
<br>
Hussein simply relinquished power by the time of the U.S. imposed deadline. 
<br>
Therefore I simply suggested, albeit with heavy sarcasm, that if Damien wishes to 
<br>
opine on human tragedy he should also mention at least some of the countless other 
<br>
examples of it that don't involve displays of American military might and 
<br>
global primacy.
<br>
<p>In fact, I myself mentioned three other examples of such tragedy in addition 
<br>
to the Hussein regime in my original post to Damien. So clearly your analysis 
<br>
that my thinking consists of Bush=good, arrogant extropians=evil is clearly 
<br>
incorrect. If anyone is guilty of oversimplification in this instance, it is 
<br>
clearly you.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I also noted that the previous note somehow was connected with 
<br>
anti-communism and several other binary us vs.
<br>
them worldviews.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;Strange.  It's like some people see reality in black and white, while others 
<br>
see whole continuums of grey and colors.&quot;
<br>
<p>Since it is apparent you are more than willing to share your ever cogent and 
<br>
not the slightest bit pretentious insights with us, Mr. Newstrom, I humbly 
<br>
request that you tell me how my &quot;position&quot; as an anti-communist (indeed, 
<br>
everyone's favorite at that) is so flawed. Let us, for the sake of this discussion, 
<br>
proclaim the &quot;us&quot; to be myself and those like me who appreciate the finer things 
<br>
in life such as representative government. And let us call the &quot;them&quot;, oh, 
<br>
the world's current and former Communist regimes who are responsible for the 
<br>
deaths of over 100 million people worldwide since 1918. 
<br>
<p>In what sense am I mistaken in preferring a world of American military 
<br>
hegemony to one dominated by the Soviets? On a smaller scale, how am I wrong to 
<br>
prefer a world in which the South Koreans are governed by democracy and not the 
<br>
whims of Kim Jong Il? How is it wrong to wish that the Soviets had not brutually 
<br>
crushed the rebellions in East Germany, Hungary, and Czechoslovakia in the 
<br>
1950s and 60s and allowed freedom to come to those beleaguered people? How is it 
<br>
wrong to wish that the Soviet Union had never invaded Afghanistan, inflicting 
<br>
a death toll of 1.5 million people on that land, 90 percent of which were 
<br>
civilian casualties? How is it wrong to wish that South Vietnam had survived, 
<br>
possibly evolving into a full and vibrant democracy, when the Communist 
<br>
alternative offers no possibility of that outcome to this very day?
<br>
<p>Ah well, what was I thinking? Such &quot;binary&quot; concerns of life, death, 
<br>
opportunity and freedom are surely beneath such a learned and cultivated individual 
<br>
such as yourself.
<br>
<p>Forever wary of &quot;Them&quot; and Communists,
<br>
<p>Max Plumm
