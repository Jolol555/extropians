</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Sure, 1+1=2 and whole of maths relies on the identity statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1 = 1 .....  but maths says nothing about the world (if you take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fictionalist view of  it as I do).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree maths &quot;says&quot; nothing about the world, in the sense that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clocks don't usually &quot;say&quot; anything about the time. Interpretation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the symbols is an active process. But my point was that maths is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful. We are able to do maths and reason and use language and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these capabilities generally confer an evolutionary advantage.
</em><br>
<p>So you have shifted from defending supernatualism (God &amp;c) as
<br>
being &quot;True&quot; to a position that it is (evolutionarily) &quot;Useful&quot; ..in the
<br>
same
<br>
way as fiction is useful in entertaining us ... but shouldn't be taken
<br>
literally.
<br>
<p>I accept that wish-fulfilment and escapism has its place for some people ...
<br>
but to build your whole life on a fiction seems wasteful and not &quot;adult&quot; and
<br>
fully evolved in some ways. A child's imaginary friend might be comforting
<br>
but is still delusional.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Arriving at the position of atheism however, if one lived in the time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Hume, looks to me, from what I imagine as the personal human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standpoint of Hume to have been a little too much reasoning for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own subjective good. I find harder to explain *why* someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like Hume didn't rationalise away an unpleasant personal truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or maybe he did. I don't know Hume's personal story that well.
</em><br>
<p>Sometimes the truth isn't what w want to hear. Tough.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I am assuming, possibly incorrectly, that being an atheist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because that position made sense to Hume on intellectual grounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would still have come at a subjective cost for him because it would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have meant (I am assuming) that he would have accepted that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally would be annihilated at death. I don't think Hume could
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have put much stock in cryonics, uploading or radical life extension.
</em><br>
<p>But as POSTHUMANS we do have these options and don't need the
<br>
obsoltete human-era religion industry ......
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, EXISTENCE truth claims require (preferably)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; verification or proof ....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you mean to say that the assertion that A is true requires
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verification or proof, I agree, but only provisionally.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone else's assertion of A being true has to be *important*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough to me for me to care whether it is true or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Whether &quot;God&quot; exists fits into the category of being worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; caring about, if one learns from one's childhood (as most in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the judeo-christian tradition do), that personal annihilation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoided at death because of a set of ideas of in which the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existence of a particular type of God is central.
</em><br>
<p>OK, so we need a better psychotherapeutics and rationale.
<br>
But anti-rational supernaturalism doesn't suit this modern
<br>
techno age. I am working on developing MVT into an
<br>
applied as well as evolutionary/ theoretic system, and
<br>
combining Connectionist psychology with new MVT hypnotherapy
<br>
techniques.
<br>
<em>&gt;   &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry you lost me at MVT.
