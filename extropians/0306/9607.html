<br>
<p><em> &gt;I'm saying if somebody hates you and does
</em><br>
<em> &gt;something incredibly bad to you, there's likely gonna
</em><br>
<em> &gt;be a reason behind it.
</em><br>
<p>Yes there are reasons for hate, and sometimes the reason is that the
<br>
attackers are rotten stupid bastards; or are you going to tell me with a
<br>
straight face that evil does not exist?
<br>
<p><em> &gt;I can't think that they concern themselves too very much with strangers
</em><br>
<em> &gt;in faraway lands.  [...]  I can see the fueling of a desire to have more,
</em><br>
<em> &gt;to have what we have, and envy as well, even strong envy.
</em><br>
<em> &gt;But homicidal hatred? I don't see it.
</em><br>
<p>Then explain why Islamic leaders promised a big reward to anyone who killed
<br>
Salman Rushdie and mobs in the street screamed for his blood when all the
<br>
poor man did was write a book published in a faraway land.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; I was just starting at the beginning.  Too far back?
</em><br>
<em> &gt; Ok.  How about Nov 2, 1917?
</em><br>
<p>The Balfour Declaration, big deal, I'm not even going to debate if it was a
<br>
good idea or not, the point is every people have a history of evil and
<br>
injustice done to them but not every people turn into homicidal maniacs; you
<br>
don't see Jews crashing airliners into German skyscrapers and they have a
<br>
much better and more recent reason to be angry than the puny little Balfour
<br>
Declaration.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt; How far back can I  go?  What are the rules on this?
</em><br>
<p>The rules are to find something in history, something in the way the west
<br>
treated Islam that was so unusually horrible, so much worse and more recent
<br>
than the Holocaust that it explains their unique rage today. Good luck.
<br>
<p><em> &gt;Let's leave Indonesia out of it.
</em><br>
<p>No. If you're correct and their intense mind numbing rage is caused by ill
<br>
treatment by the west and is not intrinsic to their dogma then you need to
<br>
explain why Indonesian Muslims hate the west every bit as much as Arab
<br>
Muslims do. No doubt if you're skillful with Google you'll be able to find
<br>
some little two bit massacre of Indonesians a century or two ago but you'll
<br>
have to do better than that. The one thing the two groups have in common
<br>
is their religion and I don't think it's unreasonable to draw a conclusion
<br>
from that.
