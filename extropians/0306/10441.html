</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt; it seems quite reasonable for them to &quot;Just be Natural.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; The argument that is accessible to anyone is Just Be Rational, Or The 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the majority perspective, unknown unknowns, and we can confirm that

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; reinforce the rule and create nonobvious incentives for rationality.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; But on new cases, the argument is the same for us as for anyone else.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; We don't know all the unknown unknowns either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A general argument for &quot;Just Be Rational&quot; must acknowledge general 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; costs, as well as general benefits.  It takes a lot of work to try to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rational, and it takes work to lie about what you believe, and there are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social costs when you fail to successfully lie about your rationality.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without some reason to believe your evolutionary heritage will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; substantially mislead you, &quot;Just be Natural&quot; seems a better strategy.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do agree that we are entering an era when in fact our evolutionary 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heritage does mislead the types of people who populate this list.  So 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Just Be Rational&quot; may well soon be best for such people.  But that is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much narrower claim.
</em><br>
<p>As it happens, I don't advocate the strategy of lying.  I also don't think 
<br>
that it's a lie to tell your girlfriend that she's the most beautiful 
<br>
woman in the world, providing she does seem that way to you; I consider 
<br>
beauty a two-place predicate between observer and observed, rather than an 
<br>
objective constant property of a given girlfriend; it may well be that 
<br>
this predicate is modified by falling in love.  And the other forms of 
<br>
self-deception you cite, such as overconfidence, seem much iffier and more 
<br>
dangerous.  Such issues aside...
<br>
<p>I think you're overlooking the incremental nature of striving for 
<br>
rationality.  Someone who says, &quot;I'm going to try and be rational&quot; does 
<br>
not instantly acquire the realization that certain actions are 
<br>
self-deceptive in nature.  It takes time to build to that level of 
<br>
self-awareness.  You seem to be thinking of some ordinary bloke who, in 
<br>
espousing rationality, is instantly emptied of all self-deceptive content 
<br>
(if only this were true!) but goes on living an ordinary life, without 
<br>
acquiring any of the higher sorceries.  This sounds to me like an 
<br>
anachronistic picture.  To the extent that you can even identify 
<br>
self-deceptions in order to give them up, you are wielding rationality on 
<br>
a very high level, at least relative to current norms.  By the time 
<br>
someone is capable of giving up all the self-deceptions that Robin Hanson 
<br>
knows how to identify, he or she will no longer be &quot;most people&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; ...  Truthseeking is a simple and intuitive idea.  The idea that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; execute adaptive self-deception is a complex counterargument.  A box 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of Little Debbie snack bars is a simple but iffy illustration of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; complex reply to the complex counterargument; the Singularity is a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; more valid illustration, but less accessible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being natural is also simple, and even more intuitive.  For most people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the possible benefits of avoiding snack bars just do not outweigh the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many costs of being rational.  If that was the main benefit, it's not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worth it.
</em><br>
<p>Funny thing... I'd bet that most people would end up saying:  &quot;For most 
<br>
people the possible benefits of avoiding snack bars just do not outweigh 
<br>
the many costs of being rational... but me, I'm different.&quot;  So are they 
<br>
being self-deceptive?  Or are you overestimating the extent to which your 
<br>
own circumstances and motives are special?  I would advise such people to 
<br>
worry about their own individual choices to be rational - to ask whether 
<br>
being rational makes sense for them, rather than imagining how someone 
<br>
else might argue it.
