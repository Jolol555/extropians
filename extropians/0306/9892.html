<em>&gt;&gt; That is, it is impossible at any time to predict whether the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; market is going to rise or fall.
</em><br>
<p>I believe technical traders invested based on the results of
<br>
technical analysis which among other things calculates a variable called
<br>
<p>Momentum, which basicly takes into account the steepness of the 
<br>
growth/decline of a stocks value and the duration of time it has 
<br>
been increasing or declining.
<br>
<p>Based on what you are saying then, there would be no basis for technical
<br>
<p>trading on momentum!
<br>
<p>Technical trading can not take into account outside sudden forces such 
<br>
as terrorism, sudden technical innovation, or major media coverage which
<br>
is where it's weakness lies.
<br>
<p>The reason technical trading works is due to the herd mentality of
<br>
investors.
<br>
<p>Major good news cause them to stampede into a buying direction while
<br>
major
<br>
Bad news causes them to stampede to sell.
<br>
<p>Even though technical trading is more often applied to individual
<br>
stocks.  There is
<br>
No reason that it can not be applied to to stock indexes.  It may even
<br>
be more accurate
<br>
since you are averaging together a great more investors in the market as
<br>
a whole.
<br>
<p>In our current F###ed up economy with the high level of uncertainty of 
<br>
terrorism and high unemployment the small investor may decide the only 
<br>
way to win is to not play the game.

<p><p><p>According to the efficient market theory, there are really no such
<br>
things as bull and bear markets.  They are optical illusions.
<br>
<p>That is, it is impossible at any time to predict whether the market is
<br>
going to rise or fall.  You can't say &quot;we are in the middle of a
<br>
bull/bear market and therefore the market is more likely than not to
<br>
rise/fall in the next few months.&quot;
<br>
<p>You can only recognize bull and bear markets retroactively.  When you
<br>
see a time when prices tended to rise, you call that a bull market.
<br>
When you see a time where prices tended to fall, you call that a bear
<br>
market. When prices didn't have much of a trend, you'll say that was
<br>
neither.
<br>
<p>So it doesn't make sense to say, buy stocks during a bull market and
<br>
sell during a bear market.  That's because it is impossible at any time
<br>
to say what the future course of stock prices will be.  All you can do
<br>
is look back, and with the wisdom of hindsight, say that you should have
<br>
bought here and sold there.  But that's not a way to make future
<br>
decisions.
<br>
<p>These observations are based both on theory and practice.  I studied
<br>
some of the academic literature several years ago, and statistically
<br>
they found virtually no correlation between past price changes and
<br>
future price changes.
