<p><em>&gt; Guys, Girls, and Friendly AIs;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The recent reaction to info about Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the latest episode in highlighting an odd situation from my point of view.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me explain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You people comprise, in my opinion, _the_ place to go for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; up-to-the-minute, cutting-edge, frontier-of-science, tech, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information. I mean, if I met some unfortunate alien who _really_
</em><br>
<em>&gt; crashed at Roswell and lost a load of nanotech, I would direct him to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you people for help and advice. You could handle that.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah besides we could use the detached opinion to settles some beefs
<br>
about who's right about the gulf war. And perhaps provide a hint as to
<br>
the location of a suspicious looking screw or two that might have been
<br>
used in those WMD :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yet I find you taken aback by such concepts as TMS, selective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; memory-wiping, and prediction of prejudice by neural scan. People jump
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about saying, 'ooh, F****** amazing!', 'Wow! F****** Fantastic!'  I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to ask, I really do:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; _Where have you guys been?_
</em><br>
<p>Standing at the back in case volunteers and test subjects are called for.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...We've been using TMS since 1987, we've been using TMS with direct
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biofeedback control since May last year, we've got computer/human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cursor control with mind only and are playing games with it at this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stage, we've been able to do selective memory wiping for at least a year
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now...
</em><br>
<p>Let me guess you *used* to suffer occassional guilt pangs from working
<br>
with human subjects -  but not any more !
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...If anyone wants the details of how to build their own TMS unit for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about $200, email me privately and I'll send the spec. (I don't want the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $200; that's what it will cost you for parts). If anybody wants to know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; where we've got _now_, email me privately and ask.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Dear me, it's like living in the 21st century!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ramonsky
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PS _Don't_ try TCES; it really hurts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; PPS (Hello DB  :  )      ...what would be _really_ funny is if nobody
</em><br>
<em>&gt; read this either. Only 3 responses last time)...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I came. I read. I pee'd on the rock and wondered what it all meant.
<br>
Too much to learn, too few brain cells. I'm preserving them.
