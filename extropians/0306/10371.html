<p>I think you vastly over-estimate the ability of most people to pretend
<br>
to believe things that they do not actually believe.  The reason that
<br>
evolution has equipped us with biased beliefs about such things is that
<br>
people are actually pretty good at detecting insincerity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You might tell your girlfriend that she is average ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I'd like to call attention to the fact that this is exactly the sort of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;thing that a person &quot;acting as if&quot; the shared social model were true would
</em><br>
<em>&gt;*not* do.  The obvious disaster cases can be safely avoided 99% of the
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;still managing to be polite regardless.
</em><br>
<p>Your girlfriend will not be satisfied with your being polite and never
<br>
bringing up the subject of what you think of her.  She will ask you, if
<br>
need be.  And she will look closely to see if you believe what you say.
