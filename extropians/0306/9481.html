Ten Commandments Symbol Passes Test
<br>
<p>Jonathan Ringel
<br>
Fulton County Daily Report
<br>
06-03-2003
<br>
<p>In the first of two cases deciding how far the government may go in its
<br>
use of religious symbols, a federal appeals panel has ruled that a local
<br>
court seal depicting the Ten Commandments does not cross the
<br>
constitutional barrier between church and state.
<br>
<p>The decision, released late Friday by the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of
<br>
Appeals, upheld the Richmond County Superior Court's use of a 1-inch
<br>
seal depicting the Ten Commandments with two rounded tablets
<br>
containing the Roman numerals I through X.
<br>
<p>The Richmond County, Ga., case could affect an argument set for
<br>
Wednesday in which another 11th Circuit panel will weigh the
<br>
constitutionality of a 5,280-pound monument of the Ten
<br>
Commandments in the Alabama Judicial Building. Chief Judge J.L.
<br>
Edmondson sits on both panels.
<br>
<p>The cases grew out of challenges by local chapters of the American
<br>
Civil Liberties Union, and other groups, alleging that the displays
<br>
violated the First Amendment's prohibition against state-established
<br>
religion. But the cases are different, an important fact in light of U.S.
<br>
Supreme Court precedent requiring judges to view Establishment
<br>
Clause challenges on a case-by-case basis.
<br>
<p>Three members of the Georgia ACLU -- an Augusta attorney, E.
<br>
Ronald Garnett; a Unitarian pastor, the Rev. Daniel King; and one of
<br>
King's congregants, Shirley Fencl -- brought the Richmond County
<br>
case against the court seal in 2000.
<br>
<p>RULING FOR THE DEFENSE
<br>
<p>Last year, Chief Judge Dudley H. Bowen Jr. of the U.S. District Court
<br>
in Augusta ruled for the defendants, the county and Elaine Johnson,
<br>
the court clerk.
<br>
<p>Bowen wrote that because the Ten Commandments played a role in
<br>
the secular development of law, a reasonable observer would not
<br>
consider a seal depicting the tablets as a primary government
<br>
endorsement of religion. He noted that in the 1870s, when the
<br>
earliest-known use of the seal was identified, at least 35 percent of
<br>
Georgians were illiterate, suggesting the county clerk needed a
<br>
symbol that graphically depicted the law.
<br>
<p>Edmondson, Senior Judge Phyllis A. Kravitch and visiting 8th Circuit
<br>
Senior Judge John R. Gibson affirmed Bowen's decision at the 11th
<br>
Circuit.
<br>
<p>Kravitch wrote for the panel that despite the Ten Commandments'
<br>
obvious religious connotations, the Richmond County court seal
<br>
passed constitutional scrutiny because it used the Ten
<br>
Commandments in a secular context -- authenticating 24,000 legal
<br>
documents filed in the Augusta courthouse each year.
<br>
<p>Kravitch noted that much public and private law grew out of the final six
<br>
commandments, which deal with honoring one's parents and prohibiting
<br>
murder, adultery, stealing, lying and coveting. Moreover, she added, the
<br>
Richmond County seal shows a sword placed behind the tablets. The
<br>
sword, according to Kravitch, is &quot;among the most recognizable symbols
<br>
of the legal system.&quot;
<br>
<p>Finally, Kravitch concluded that the seal's size -- about 1 inch in
<br>
diameter -- made it &quot;discreet,&quot; as opposed to other, larger Ten
<br>
Commandments images held to violate the First Amendment's
<br>
prohibition against state-established religion.
<br>
<p>Kravitch contrasted the Richmond County case with others in which
<br>
courts struck down the use of large monuments to the Ten
<br>
Commandments on public grounds. Those cases, she wrote, &quot;involved
<br>
displays that were large or 'in your face' and occupied a place of
<br>
prominence or special honor, often dominating the other objects
<br>
surrounding them.&quot;
<br>
<p>Kravitch's comments on size offered an intriguing clue as to how the
<br>
11th Circuit might view the Alabama case, although she did not
<br>
mention it specifically. That case deals with efforts by Alabama
<br>
Supreme Court Chief Justice Roy S. Moore to keep a Ten
<br>
Commandments monument he designed in the colonnaded rotunda
<br>
of the state's judicial building.
<br>
<p>Occupying about 36 cubic feet, the monument is capped by two tablets
<br>
that suggest an open Bible. Engraved on the tablets are the Ten
<br>
Commandments, as excerpted from Exodus in the King James Bible,
<br>
starting with &quot;I am the Lord thy God&quot; and &quot;Thou shalt have no other
<br>
Gods before me.&quot;
<br>
<p>On each side of the monument, Moore added 14 quotations, including
<br>
the motto on U.S. currency, &quot;In God We Trust,&quot; and a reference in the
<br>
Declaration of Independence to &quot;Laws of nature and of nature's God.&quot;
<br>
<p>Moore claims that the monument depicts the moral foundation of the
<br>
law.
<br>
<p>MONUMENT ORDERED REMOVED
<br>
<p>Last year, U.S. District Judge Myron H. Thompson ordered Moore to
<br>
remove the monument, which Thompson called the &quot;centerpiece&quot; of
<br>
the Alabama Judicial Building's rotunda. Moore refused, and in so
<br>
doing, set up Wednesday's argument in Montgomery, Ala., before
<br>
Edmondson, 11th Circuit Judge Edward E. Carnes, and Richard W.
<br>
Story, an Atlanta federal district judge assigned to the case.
<br>
<p>Edmondson penned a four-sentence concurrence to Kravitch's decision
<br>
in the Richmond County court-seal case. He indicated that he wrote
<br>
separately &quot;because I am uncomfortable with the characterization and
<br>
the manner of application of some of the precedents discussed as the
<br>
Court explains its decision.&quot;
<br>
<p>Edmondson did agree, however, that &quot;no precedent comes close&quot; to
<br>
compelling the conclusion that the Richmond County display violated
<br>
the U.S. Constitution. King v. Richmond County, No. 02-14146 (11th
<br>
Cir., May 30, 2003). The Richmond County plaintiffs plan on asking
<br>
the full 11th Circuit to reconsider the ruling, said Robert L. Tsai, a
<br>
University of Oregon law professor who first brought the case when he
<br>
was a lawyer for the Georgia ACLU.
<br>
<p>Tsai said he was &quot;extremely disappointed&quot; by the ruling, which he
<br>
described as the first federal appellate decision since 1980 that upholds
<br>
government use of the Ten Commandments.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's the only decision holding that religious symbols without religious
<br>
words somehow alters the impact of an obviously sacred symbol,&quot;
<br>
Tsai wrote in an e-mail.
<br>
<p>&quot;It's the first ruling suggesting that courts might be able to use the
<br>
Commandments for official business, while other governmental entities
<br>
are not,&quot; Tsai added. &quot;Apparently, smaller replications of the
<br>
Commandments to the tune of 24,000 per year don't equal one large
<br>
display.&quot;
<br>
<p>James W. Ellison of the Augusta firm Burnside, Wall, Daniel, Ellison
<br>
&amp; Revell represented Richmond County in its successful defense of
<br>
the court seal.
<br>
<p>He noted that the court had rejected Tsai's argument that if the seal
<br>
resembled the Ten Commandments, then it was automatically in
<br>
violation of the First Amendment. &quot;You can't make that leap,&quot; said
<br>
Ellison, emphasizing that the seal had a clearly secular purpose of
<br>
authenticating documents.
<br>
<p>CONTEXT CONSIDERED KEY
<br>
<p>With regard to the Alabama case, Ellison noted that the 11th Circuit
<br>
made clear that the context of a challenged Ten Commandments
<br>
display was key -- and that no factor is &quot;outcome determinative.&quot;
<br>
<p>Danielle Lipow of the Southern Poverty Law Center, one of the groups
<br>
challenging the Alabama Ten Commandments monument, said that
<br>
the Richmond County case, King v. Richmond County, &quot;bodes very
<br>
well&quot; for her case.
<br>
<p>&quot;The enormous Ten Commandments monument that Chief Justice
<br>
Moore installed in the Alabama State Judicial Building could not be
<br>
more different than the inconspicuous symbol at issue in King, and
<br>
the court's opinion in King makes it very clear that the Eleventh Circuit
<br>
will recognize the constitutional significance of those differences,&quot; she
<br>
wrote in an e-mail.
<br>
<p>A spokesman for Americans United for the Separation of Church and
<br>
State, which also is involved in the Alabama case, echoed Lipow's
<br>
comments.
<br>
<p>Herbert W. Titus, Moore's lawyer, could not be reached to discuss the
<br>
impact the King case would have on the Alabama case, Glassroth v.
<br>
Moore, Nos. 02-16708-D and 02-16949-DD.
