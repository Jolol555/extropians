&quot;Physics in Action&quot; wrote:
<br>
&lt;Perhaps the deepest mystery in all of physics is quantum non-locality -
<br>
the ability of two distant systems to instantaneously know about each other.
<br>
Non-locality means that two particles in a quantum system can be
<br>
&quot;entangled&quot; such that the state of one particle affects the state of the
<br>
other, regardless of how far apart they are. As well as challenging our
<br>
common sense, non-locality suggests that the ultimate speed limit - the
<br>
speed of light - is violated. Einstein spent many years worrying about
<br>
this problem because such &quot;superluminal&quot; interactions seem to be
<br>
incompatible with special relativity.&gt;
<br>
<p><p>But this is, at least, a bit confusing.
<br>
In their long debate both Einstein and Bohr
<br>
made subtle but important errors, after the famous
<br>
EPR paper, but also before (discussing those gedanken
<br>
experiments, in 1927 and also later).
<br>
But let us stay with the entangled particles.
<br>
<p>EPR wrote that &quot;if, without in any way disturbing
<br>
a system, we can predict with certainty (i.e. with
<br>
probability equal to unity) the value of a physical
<br>
quantity, then there exists an element of physical
<br>
reality corresponding to this physical quantity.&quot;
<br>
They discussed a composite system, composed of
<br>
two entangled, but separated, subsystems, and they
<br>
made the point that the precise value of 'any'
<br>
observable of subsystem 1 is 'real' because it can be
<br>
predicted - without disturbing subsystem 1
<br>
itself - by measuring the precisely correlated
<br>
observable of the separated, and entangled, subsystem 2.
<br>
<p>Now, quantum mechanics cannot predict precise values
<br>
fot two non-commuting observables (i.e. two such observables
<br>
of subsystem 1 cannot have simultaneous reality). Hence
<br>
- EPR say - quantum mechanics is not &quot;complete&quot;.
<br>
(The EPR paper was written by Podolski alone, Einstein
<br>
was just interested in the physical point, the so called
<br>
quantum 'non-separability', and not much in the logical
<br>
point above).
<br>
<p>Well, Bohr responded that until the experimental
<br>
procedure is specified, there is a possibility of
<br>
&quot;an influence on the very conditions which define
<br>
the possible types of predictions regarding the future
<br>
behavior of the system.&quot; In other words, since mutually
<br>
exclusive experimental procedures are needed to
<br>
measure non-commuting observables, the prediction
<br>
of the precise values of the two non-commuting
<br>
observables is impossible (hence they are not
<br>
real at the same time). In other words, the EPR
<br>
experimental setup precludes, by itself, a complete
<br>
description of subsystem 1 (or subsystem 2) in
<br>
isolation. (Btw, this semi-obscure position by Bohr
<br>
- many important authors did not understand what
<br>
he was trying to say - is of course invalid
<br>
in the context of MWI.)
<br>
<p>Then why did it appear to EPR that non-commuting
<br>
observables of subsystem 1 may be &quot;predicted&quot;
<br>
(without disturbing subsystem 1) by measuring
<br>
the entangled subsystem 2? There is a conceptual error,
<br>
here. Subtle, subtle, and conceptual.
<br>
<p>Actually it can be shown that each subsystem is in a
<br>
&quot;mixed state&quot; and one can only &quot;predict&quot; with certainty
<br>
that *if* an apparatus 2 measures the value an observable
<br>
of the subsystem 2 *then* we can deduce, or infer, the value
<br>
for the correspondent observable of subsystem 1.
<br>
<p>But this is a *conditional* probability and not a &quot;prediction&quot;
<br>
for the complete knowledge of the quantum state of the subsystem 1.
<br>
<p>These conditional probabilities are, thus, not properties
<br>
of subsystems alone but, rather, properties of the composite
<br>
system. That is to say that the measurement of subsystem 2,
<br>
by apparatus 2, has no effect on the state of subsystem 1
<br>
alone.
<br>
<p>We can also say that the EPR scheme always involves a comparison
<br>
of subsystem 1 and 2. Or, to say it in better terms,
<br>
EPR involves a conparison of records of apparatus 1
<br>
(measuring subsystem 1) and apparatus 2 (measuring
<br>
subsystem 2). And there is no reason, in orthodox quantum
<br>
mechanics, to suppose that the measurement of subsystem 2,
<br>
by apparatus 2, has any effect on subsystem 1, and
<br>
viceversa. Such an effect (&quot;passion at a distance&quot;,
<br>
after Albert Shimony) would violate special relativity,
<br>
but the only possible effect here is the relationship
<br>
between apparata 1 and 2, and the comparison
<br>
of records stored in apparata 1 and 2. Which are not
<br>
superluminal.
<br>
<p>(It can be shown why subsystems 1 and 2 are &quot;mixed states&quot;,
<br>
and also why EPR scheme does not require any &quot;collapse&quot; or
<br>
&quot;projection postulate&quot;.)
