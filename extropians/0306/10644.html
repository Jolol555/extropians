<p><em>&gt; &gt; No.  It is baseless slander to accuse people of supporting persons and

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right.  What you literally write here is absolutely correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The particular question concerned the charge (against an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American) of being &quot;anti-American&quot;.  It is an exaggeration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to say that this is necessarily slanderous.  It will depend
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on what &quot;anti-American&quot; means: for example, it may mean those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who are always against American foreign policy.  Still, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; totally agree that such a charge, if not expressed as a possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or phrased as a question, could turn out to be not only wrong,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but insulting and inflammatory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I still don't see there is any question how it will &quot;turn out&quot; when people on 
<br>
this list have been accused directly of supporting various direct enemies 
<br>
only on the basis of disagreeing with our misadventure in Iraq, for instance. 
<br>
The question of what is meant is no longer present when the accusations get 
<br>
that explicit.  So why leave the benefit of the doubt with those making such 
<br>
accusations?   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Why is the burden of effort on those who are the victims of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slander?  The slander itself is against the principles of this list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Because, Samantha, it cannot be so easily established that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *is* slander!  In fact the charge of slander fits into this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very same category: if it is not expressed as a possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or phrased as a question, then it itself may turn out to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong, or at least insulting and inflammatory.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It it about as obvious as the nose on your face.  I regret that you choose to 
<br>
use your fine mind and rhetorical skills to ignore something so blatant.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You can't *automatically* declare something to be slander
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and thus make it so!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Please tell me what would not be slander if accusing people of outrageous 
<br>
postions, attitudes and character flaws thaty they have not claimed or given 
<br>
evidence of is not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, I do not believe that is what is going on.  Actually real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; slander is being done and the quotes are misplaced.  [To] Point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out that it is slander to call any of us a &quot;war criminal&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so on is not in the least on the same level as using those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terms against those who oppose some of this country's recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; actions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;War criminal?&quot;  I'm sorry, but do you have a reference of someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on this list being called a &quot;war criminal&quot;?  I can't find one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I do have better things to do than pretend that your pretending that things 
<br>
are better here than they are is a reasonable position.  I was referring to 
<br>
what was mentioned just a few posts ago but I haven't the time now to dig it 
<br>
up again.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, you are absolutely right that to call someone a war criminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would qualify as slanderous because the meaning is so concrete, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be dismissed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Good. A point of agreement.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In this country it is also not a matter of debate whether simply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; disagreeing with the actions of the government and saying so makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one anti_US or unpatriotic much less a &quot;traitor&quot;.  The freedom to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; do so is one of the defining principles of this country.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely.  But in time of war (as in March), the specific meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of traitor (&quot;giving aid and comfort to a nation's enemy&quot;, see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of &quot;treason&quot;) makes this less clear.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is not legally or constitutionally &quot;a time of war&quot; AND there is nothing in 
<br>
the constitution that claims one loses the right to criticize the government 
<br>
in a real time of war or that it is traitorous to do so.  If you believe 
<br>
otherwise then plese quote the precise section.   If it is treason to say the 
<br>
truth as I see it then let them come for me!
