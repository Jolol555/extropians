<p>I have a &quot;Plan A&quot; and &quot;Plan B&quot; approach (and would likely have &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot;
<br>
if I had enough time to think of them).  [There has to be a movie out there
<br>
where someone witty says &quot;that plan will never work&quot; (be it &quot;A&quot; or &quot;B&quot; or ...)]
<br>
<p>At any rate.  I am not so extremely optimistic about the rate of development
<br>
of &quot;a-biologics&quot; that we will have them in the next 20, perhaps even 30-40
<br>
years.  I would like that to be the case but I think the regulatory hurdles
<br>
may slow things significantly (unless one goes offshore).
<br>
<p>*But* I am fairly optimistic about the development of biological therapies
<br>
to provide near-term solutions (e.g. stem-cell therapies are moving *much*
<br>
faster than I would have predicted even 5 years ago).
<br>
<p>So if biological solutions provide 10/20/30 year solutions (Plan A)
<br>
until a-biological solutions based on nanotechnology or similar
<br>
therapeutics become available (Plan B) or even uploading is
<br>
developed as a reliable technology (Plan C) -- then I'm a
<br>
happy camper.
