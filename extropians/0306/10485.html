<p>
As the virtual worlds get more and more interesting
<br>
and people start buying up real estate, artifacts,
<br>
prileges, etc., it might be worth looking at an
<br>
ongoing predecessor - Manga!
<br>
<p>I recently visited a Japanese coffee shop / book store
<br>
and, noting a whole bunch of unbelievably cute slender
<br>
young Japanese girls, all sporting the same hair
<br>
styles, clothes, etc., all like something right out of
<br>
a Manga fantasy novel, I asked the cashier (similarly
<br>
atired) the following:
<br>
<p>&quot;Does Manga drive fashion, or does fashion drive
<br>
Manga.&quot;
<br>
<p>Once she understood the question, she replied that she
<br>
thought that Manga drove fashion, which I had
<br>
suspected.  For those who are uninitiated to the Manga
<br>
scene, the differentiating characteristic is simply
<br>
that the text is integrated with graphics, as in a
<br>
comic book.  Manga, however, covers the entire gamut
<br>
of literary expression, and must be taken - where it
<br>
applies - as serious literature.
<br>
<p>To try to settle an issue of biology and culture that
<br>
same weekend, I bought a couple of cheap XXX DVDs from
<br>
a Japanese vendor at a local computer swap meet. 
<br>
Interesting.  As I had surmised from other sources,
<br>
Japanese/Asian men appear to be somewhat
<br>
physiologically deficient in at least one area - at
<br>
least wrt relative gross size...  Nice to know, as a
<br>
normally endowed Euro.  (But they make up for it in
<br>
energy, it seemed.)
<br>
<p>However, perhaps more interesting was the take on sex
<br>
that seemed to prevail - admittedly with a small
<br>
sample, but it does dovetail with other data nicely. 
<br>
While Euro/American women are generally portrayed as
<br>
enjoying sex in the corresponding sort of videos, the
<br>
Japanese women are invariably shown crying out in
<br>
pain, and the relationship is clearly portrayed as one
<br>
of power, with strong undertones of sadamasochism.  I
<br>
found it boring and tasteless rather than erotically
<br>
stimulating, despite the fact that the women were
<br>
quite beautiful.
<br>
<p>In fact, by comparison, the eroticism in the printed
<br>
Manga is far more captivating.  I got a couple of big
<br>
boxes of Manga novels of all kinds by accident from a
<br>
closing store recently, and made the error of starting
<br>
to glance through them as I was loading them into my
<br>
office.  Two hours later....  I'm straining my eyes in
<br>
the twilight still trying to make it through the door.
<br>
<p>From an objectivist standpoint, the printed Manga is
<br>
art as it should be, romantic, stylized, architypal
<br>
portrayals of life at its essense.  The art is often
<br>
truly beautiful, and the erotic scenes....  Well, I'll
<br>
let the reader check it out.
<br>
<p>So, content rules.  A static image on paper beats
<br>
thousands of frames of motion video.
<br>
<p>I did note that the same vendors at the swap meet did
<br>
have XXX Manga videos or &quot;anime.&quot;  However, they cost
<br>
3X the live DVD price.
