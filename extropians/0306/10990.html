Emlyn -
<br>
<p>I think you can avoid the contradiction by modifying your Axiom 1 from &quot;I
<br>
exist (am)&quot; or &quot;I think&quot; to  &quot;Something exists&quot;, or &quot;Something thinks&quot;.  I
<br>
think this would serve the intended purpose in the logical argument you
<br>
described.

</em><br>
<p>(What is this &quot;I&quot; the human speaks of?  We in the hive find this concept to

be very strange.)

<p><em>&gt; Tenuous hypothesis 1: I have sensory input implying other stuff, and

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tenuous hypothesis 2: I am part of the set of other stuff.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious self; self is an illusion, &quot;I&quot; am just a pattern of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find that if I take Tenuous Hypotheses 1 &amp; 2 as axioms, I produce
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Result: I am not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; By my original axiom, I now have A and ~A. I've just flushed reality
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down the toilet. What is existence?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't fault the materialist viewpoint, because I can't support the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternative; the closer I look, the more it appears that there is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible role at all for any proposed non-physical piece of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; phenomenon, about information processing. Which means that &quot;I&quot; am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not; &quot;I&quot; am an illusion (fooling who? what?).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can only find paradox at the base of any search for an explanation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the only phenomenon in the universe that I can definitely call
</em><br>
<em>&gt; axiomatic (that I am).
</em><br>
<p>It is axiomatic that *something* exists, but not that *I* exist since this
<br>
would require defining what what *I* is, and this leads to that circular
<br>
reasoning that's troubling you.
<br>
<p>There is no self separate from the rest of the universe.  The concept of
<br>
self is a process that evolved within certain replicating patterns of the
<br>
universe due to its utility to the survival and further propagation of those
<br>
patterns.  The concept of &quot;self&quot; (everything inside) and &quot;not self&quot;
<br>
(everything outside) is fundamental to virtually all complex processes that
<br>
promote survival and thus propagation of the organism.  No wonder its so
<br>
difficult to see.
<br>
<p>To me, it is more clearly evident than the
<br>
<em>&gt; existence of anything else. But apparently it cannot be true.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Help.
