<p>The mind makes a comeback By Lou Marano
<br>
Published 6/18/2003 7:03 PM
<br>
<p><p>WASHINGTON, June 18 (UPI) -- After a century of skepticism, the notion that 
<br>
the mind exists independently of the brain is making a modest comeback.
<br>
<p>Current interest in the subject was renewed when University of Arizona 
<br>
philosopher David Chalmers made the argument that consciousness is a non-physical 
<br>
feature of the world in his 1996 book &quot;The Conscious Mind.&quot;
<br>
<p>For the skeptics (sometimes called materialist reductionists) the mind is 
<br>
simply a word that we apply to functioning of the human brain, and consciousness 
<br>
is a brain state. Others counter that pain, for example, is not a brain state, 
<br>
but rather a phenomenological property produced by brain activity and 
<br>
distinct from it.
<br>
<p>One prominent skeptic, UC Berkeley philosopher John Searle, critiqued 
<br>
Chalmers' position in the New York Review of Books. (Searle's book &quot;The Rediscovery 
<br>
of Mind&quot; appeared in 1992.)
<br>
<p>Chalmers has rebutted Searle's energetically, both in the review and on his 
<br>
Web site, and partisans have lined up on both sides. 
<br>
<p>But semantic stumbling blocks and confusing categories abound. Scholars don't 
<br>
always use words to mean the same thing. For example, &quot;mind&quot; can be used to 
<br>
mean everything from observable cognition to a synonym for the immortal soul of 
<br>
Christian belief. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Nature is not a respecter of words,&quot; said Stanley Krippner, professor of 
<br>
Psychology at the Saybrook Graduate School in San Francisco. Rather, human beings 
<br>
slice nature up and put labels on it. &quot;Sometimes the map represents the 
<br>
territory, and sometimes the map is pretty far distant from the territory,&quot; 
<br>
Krippner told United Press International.
<br>
<p>The separation between the mind and the brain does not exist in Eastern 
<br>
thought, he said.
<br>
<p>The scientific method is justly thought to be a Western contribution. But 
<br>
Krippner thinks Eastern and &quot;indigenous&quot; peoples are more scientific -- in that 
<br>
their views are closer to reality -- because they don't have the mind-body 
<br>
split elaborated by the French philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650). As Krippner 
<br>
tells it, Descartes tried to change the relationship between science and 
<br>
theology as a political expedient.
<br>
<p>&quot;He realized that the Roman Catholic Church thought that it was in control of 
<br>
all knowledge. And he could see how this was holding back science.&quot;
<br>
<p>Krippner said Descartes, reasoning that half a loaf is better than none, 
<br>
postulated the mind-body split. &quot;Let the scientists study the body, and let the 
<br>
theologians study the mind. That Cartesian split is still with us.&quot;
<br>
<p>Krippner doesn't like to use the word mind because it leaves out emotions. 
<br>
&quot;Mind is mental; it's intellectual. And brain leaves out the endocrine system 
<br>
and cardiovascular system; that's all part of human behavior and human 
<br>
functioning.&quot;
<br>
<p>Neuroscience -- the science of the nervous system -- is subdivided into 
<br>
cognitive and affective branches, Krippner said. Affective neuroscience recognizes 
<br>
that the whole body operates as a unit when it comes to the emotions -- not 
<br>
just the brain. 
<br>
<p>&quot;The more you look at it, you can see how constricted and ultimately useless 
<br>
that term 'mind' has become,&quot; he told UPI.
<br>
<p>What about those who use the word &quot;mind&quot; to mean the temporal manifestation 
<br>
of the soul?
<br>
<p>&quot;Many people do that,&quot; Krippner replied. &quot;I turn that on its head and say the 
<br>
soul or 'mind' can survive the so-called death of the body. But how do you 
<br>
know that all of the body has really died? You can be a thoroughgoing 
<br>
materialist, as far as I'm concerned, and still accept the notion of survival. It just 
<br>
means that our concept of the material has to be expanded a little. It has to 
<br>
be tweaked. ... It all depends on what meaning you attribute to words. So much 
<br>
of this discussion is semantic and conditioned by culture.
<br>
<p>&quot;From my point of view, the whole mind-body dichotomy is something best 
<br>
relegated to the dustbin of history,&quot; he said. &quot;We now have to think in terms of 
<br>
interactive systems and field effects. A field can exert influence at a 
<br>
distance, both forward and backward in time, as we are finding out from quantum 
<br>
mechanics. We have to find different words to reflect what's really going on. I 
<br>
think that neuroscience is helping us to do this.&quot;
<br>
<p>Krippner's respect for non-Western epistemologies and openness to post-death 
<br>
&quot;survival&quot; puts him at the inclusive end of the materialist consensus. But to 
<br>
make things more confusing, a scholar with similar beliefs finds Cartesian 
<br>
dualism indispensable. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I happen to be a dualist,&quot; said Robert Almeder, a philosopher at Georgia 
<br>
State University in Atlanta. &quot;Minds are not reducible to brains. They are 
<br>
identifiably distinct from brain states, like souls.&quot;
<br>
<p>Almeder respectfully reviewed Chalmers' &quot;The Conscious Mind,&quot; finding 
<br>
Chalmers' critique of the materialist paradigm &quot;very persuasive.&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;A number of distinguished materialists do not believe in the existence of 
<br>
minds,&quot; Almeder told UPI. &quot;They think any and all statements about mental or 
<br>
emotional life is simply an alternative way of describing some neuro-biological 
<br>
state. Consciousness itself (in this view) is either a complex property of the 
<br>
brain or a biological property produced by the brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>They deride consciousness &quot;the ghost in the machine.&quot;
<br>
<p>According to this &quot;canonical&quot; materialist paradigm, consciousness ceases to 
<br>
exist when the brain ceases to exist.
<br>
<p>But Almeder said the assumptions of this paradigm are not at all obvious. For 
<br>
example, the taste of coffee is not a brain state, he said. Feelings don't 
<br>
seem to be brain states but are made possible by the existence of brain states. 
<br>
<p>Almeder applied Chalmers' &quot;argument from zombies&quot; to illustrate the 
<br>
materialists' failure to explain how consciousness emerges from neural processes in the 
<br>
brain. &quot;If people were free from consciousness, and everything is explained 
<br>
in terms of biochemical activity, then they would be zombies. What missing 
<br>
element would have to be supplied to produce a human being?&quot; 
<br>
<p>Almeder said Chalmers thinks we answer the wrong questions and avoid such 
<br>
hard ones as: &quot;Why is all this mental processing accompanied by an experienced 
<br>
inner life?&quot; 
<br>
<p>Understanding the brain is necessary for understanding consciousness, but is 
<br>
it sufficient? Almeder asked. He used the example of someone who decides to 
<br>
raise his arm.
<br>
<p>&quot;How can I put myself into the brain state that causes my arm to go up unless 
<br>
there's something other than the brain causing the arm to go up? ... There's 
<br>
a transfer of kinetic energy, but there's no discernable physical object to 
<br>
explain why people do what they do.&quot;
<br>
<p>Following the &quot;classic dualism&quot; of the ancient and medieval philosophers who 
<br>
preceded Descartes, Almeder said the soul is called &quot;the mind&quot; when viewed as 
<br>
a thinking substance and &quot;the will&quot; when viewed as a volitional activity, 
<br>
neither of which is reducible to systemic biochemical states.
<br>
<p>&quot;The biochemical states of the system can have effects on those things -- 
<br>
causing you to think, wish, will, and believe. And the mental events can have 
<br>
effects on your bodily states, as when you're embarrassed and you turn red. And 
<br>
when the body goes to the grave, there is something essentially non-physical 
<br>
that can survive the corruption and can go somewhere or other depending on your 
<br>
religious aspirations.&quot;
<br>
<p>But Almeder said that with the rise of the philosophy of science in the 18th 
<br>
century and the Vienna positivists in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, 
<br>
the only questions that could be answered legitimately were those of natural 
<br>
science. Questions about other entities that might be causal agents were 
<br>
excluded if they couldn't be seen, smelled, heard, tasted, or touched -- or if it 
<br>
couldn't be determined how they convey energy.
<br>
<p>Almeder thinks that there is good empirical evidence for the existence of 
<br>
minds.
<br>
<p>&quot;If you can get good evidence for reincarnation and out-of-body experiences, 
<br>
then you have evidence that human beings are quite distinct from their 
<br>
bodies,&quot; he said. He believes reincarnation is a scientifically testable thesis and 
<br>
is impressed by the research of Ian Stevenson of the University of Virginia. 
<br>
<p>He also thinks the experiments of Karlis Osis and Donna McCormick support the 
<br>
existence of voluntary out-of-body experiences.
<br>
<p>But why does a believer in souls need a concept of &quot;the mind&quot;?
<br>
<p>&quot;That's just another way of saying there is something about a human being 
<br>
that's essential to the personality that does not reduce to brain states,&quot; 
<br>
Almeder answered.
<br>
<p>Vanderbilt psychologist David Zald was asked a similar question. 
<br>
<p>&quot;That's definitely something that comes up,&quot; he said. &quot;If we have a soul, 
<br>
where is it? Given that our brain is what allows us to accomplish what we do as 
<br>
humans, it's natural to start wondering if the mind is the seat of the soul. 
<br>
It's a natural course of reasoning if not an exclusive one. It's not that the 
<br>
soul would have to be equivalent to the mind. But it's natural to wonder about 
<br>
that being the connecting point. 
<br>
<p>&quot;If we take a strictly materialistic view of the world, then one is left 
<br>
struggling with the question of where the soul fits in. ... Science so far does 
<br>
not provide much evidence for (the soul). I'm not saying there isn't a soul, but 
<br>
our scientific methods don't specifically elucidate that. These are difficult 
<br>
questions.&quot;
<br>
<p>Zald's personal view is that the mind emerges from the functioning of the 
<br>
brain. &quot;If you look at just the simple parts of the brain, you will not arrive at 
<br>
a conscious mind. But when those processes are put together, the mind emerges 
<br>
from it.&quot;
<br>
<p>So the whole is greater than the sum of the parts?
<br>
<p>&quot;Essentially,&quot; Zald replied.
<br>
<p>Stanley Kuczaj, Chairman of the Department of Psychology at the University of 
<br>
Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Miss., said we still know very little 
<br>
about the relationship between the mind and the brain. But a relationship 
<br>
assumes the existence of two separate entities. Is the mind the name we give to 
<br>
neurological activity, or is the mind something apart from that?
<br>
<p>&quot;I have a hard time imagining the mind could exist independently of that 
<br>
activity,&quot; he replied.
<br>
<p>Dedre Gentner, professor of Psychology and director of the Cognitive Science 
<br>
Program at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., said: &quot;I'm not fond of 
<br>
the view that the mind floats in an aura around the brain or some other such 
<br>
ineffable position. But I think it's a big mistake to confuse the mind and the 
<br>
brain (because) we know probably hundreds of times more about the mind than we 
<br>
do about the brain at this point. Most of what we know about higher-order 
<br>
cognitive functions can't yet be traced in any kind of clear way -- if at all -- 
<br>
in the brain.&quot;
<br>
<p>This came as a surprise to the interviewer, who assumed that the brain -- a 
<br>
physical organ -- would have been better understood than the mind, which some 
<br>
people consider an abstraction. But Gentner seemed to be using &quot;mind&quot; to mean 
<br>
evidence of thinking.
<br>
<p>&quot;We can do quite a bit with tracing perception,&quot; Gentner continued. &quot;It's not 
<br>
difficult to get some pretty good information about how vision works, for 
<br>
example.&quot; But we are far from understanding how someone does counterfactual or 
<br>
hypothetical reasoning, or checks a theory for consistency, she said.
<br>
<p>So then is the &quot;mind&quot; simply a catch-all term that we use to describe brain 
<br>
functioning that we don't understand?
<br>
<p>&quot;No,&quot; she replied, &quot;but that's a good question given what I just said.
<br>
<p>&quot;We believe our refrigerators work because of the properties of molecules, 
<br>
and below the molecules are the principles of quantum mechanics, and so on. But 
<br>
it would be absolutely crazy to describe the way a refrigerator works in terms 
<br>
of quantum mechanics because it's seven levels too low, and the right level 
<br>
of explanation for a refrigerator is how the coolant behaves as it flows around 
<br>
the system.
<br>
<p>&quot;Many, many phenomena are multi-leveled, and cognition is one of them. Lots 
<br>
of processes can be described either in terms of, let's say, neural firing and 
<br>
chemical paths in the brain. Or they can be described in terms of processes 
<br>
like seeing if two representations are consistent, or making inferences if 
<br>
there's missing information. You really need them both.
<br>
<p>&quot;It would be crazy to explain the operation of a Mack truck in terms of 
<br>
quantum mechanics, and it would be crazy to try to explain inference in terms of 
<br>
nothing but brain-level mechanisms.&quot;
<br>
<p>Once again the interviewer was confounded and guessed that the brain works at 
<br>
the level of Newtonian physics and the mind at the level of quantum 
<br>
mechanics. WRONG! In fact, it's the other way around.
<br>
<p>&quot;The brain is the substrate,&quot; Gentner explained. &quot;When the truck goes down 
<br>
the street, we believe that way down there is some kind of atomic and subatomic 
<br>
explanation. But that would not be a good way to explain something that's 
<br>
several levels up, because each level has its own emergent principles. ... 
<br>
<p>&quot;Explaining the locomotion of a truck according to quantum mechanics would be 
<br>
incredibly inefficient. We'd never get the answer. 
<br>
<p>&quot;You really can explain things very nicely at the Newtonian level,&quot; she said 
<br>
-- the level of the mind.
