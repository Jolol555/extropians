</em><br>
<p>Yes, this really happens.  In the United States it is called a Patent
<br>
Secrecy Order and is described at <a href="http://www.sumeria.net/free/secorder.html">http://www.sumeria.net/free/secorder.html</a>
<br>
and <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/invention/program.html">http://www.fas.org/sgp/othergov/invention/program.html</a> for example.
<br>
<p>If your invention is given such an order, you not only don't get the
<br>
patent, you aren't allowed to make or use the invention, or to tell anyone
<br>
about it.  One reference I found from the 1980s suggested that there were
<br>
several thousand patent secrecy orders in effect in the United States at
<br>
that time, many of them relating to cryptography.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It occurs to me, please bear in mind I have only started looking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into this, that almost all the technologies transhumanist types
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are likely to have an interest in could be seen as having some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sort of military application. Nano, AI, cryto, aspects of biotech.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It would be kinda nice to know that IP is not being stockpiled
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for someone else with more martial inclinations.
</em><br>
<p>One way to avoid a patent secrecy order is to not patent your idea.  As far
<br>
as I know, there is no comparable procedure to hush up your invention if
<br>
you don't patent it.  Of course certain areas such as nuclear research
<br>
are &quot;born classified&quot; and you can't start selling nuclear reactors.
<br>
It's possible that eventually nanotech and similar technologies will be
<br>
treated like nuclear work, something illegal unless done under government
<br>
supervision.
