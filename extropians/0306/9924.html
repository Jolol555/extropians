<p>
<em>&gt; My advice now, to myself and to my friends and family, is to stay long.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Never go short and never sell unless you really need the money. Own a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonably but not overly diversified portfolio. In the long run the
</em><br>
market
<br>
<em>&gt; rewards investors according to the level of risk they take (on the long
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side).
</em><br>
<p>Good advice.
<br>
<p>Add to that the following worstcase evasive measures :
<br>
<p>Do not have all stocks in one account. Try to diversify to 2 or 3 accounts
<br>
located in different countries.
<br>
Try to hold assets denominated in several currencies / minerals.
<br>
If You hold large amounts of cash, try to diversify into a few different
<br>
currencies.
<br>
If You have enough money to make transactions a small part of the overall
<br>
picture, consider having some money placed overseas, controlled by another
<br>
juridical identity.
<br>
<p>The problem is, of course that You cannot trust the government where you
<br>
live to be stable over long periods of time, and having everything in one
<br>
brokerage account, and denominated in one currency could get you a total
<br>
wipeout.
<br>
<p><p>You mentioned a statistical test of a trading system. My plan is to divide
<br>
my historic data into several sets, and then test and build my systems using
<br>
only one set of data. I will then verify the systems on another set, and
<br>
perhaps double chenk with a third set of data. For that to work i will have
<br>
to split up the sets in a few years each, or split up the market in three
<br>
pools of stocks, all spanning the entire period.
<br>
<p>If i create 10 working systems on dataset1, then if only one works with
<br>
dataset2 it is probably just a random accident. If 9 or 8 works, i might
<br>
have discovered some anomality that existed in the datasets in that period.
<br>
Of course i will never know when the anomality goes away.
<br>
<p>I have downloaded and i am in the process of reading about 300 scientific
<br>
papers on the subjects of money management, investing, futures, options,
<br>
neural networks, stock trading schemes, statistics etc. I don't think i will
<br>
finish anytime soon, but i get wiser every day at least. I have identified
<br>
the need to learn some more statistics, so i am looking forward to enrolling
<br>
my next degree ( where statistics is one of the courses ).
<br>
<p>Fun, that You mention gambling (on the wrong side of the counter) as a
<br>
possible venue of income. I have found several non-effective markets in
<br>
gambling and have profited from a few, although not much money. If it is
<br>
possible to get a positive income from gambling , it should be possible to
<br>
live on investing too, given a reasonable amount of capital for investment.
<br>
Or perhaps the stock markets are effective but gambling markets are not? If
<br>
so - how can that be? Perhaps only stock markets of stocks with an average
<br>
volume above xx are effective? Or perhaps different stock markets (different
<br>
groups of stocks defined by average trading volume) are effective on some
<br>
scale going from totally non-effective to effective within 1% of actual
<br>
value?.
<br>
