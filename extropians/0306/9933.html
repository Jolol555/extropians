As this list discussed the Atkins diet not long ago, I am forwarding this
<br>
post from my Quackwatch list FYI (I have no opinion on the Atkins diet
<br>
myself, and have never tried it and don't diet ... at least to lose weight).
<br>
The bottom part of the post makes the claim that the diet doesn't work, the
<br>
top part is in response to that claim:

<em>&gt; | &gt; Hopeless Fad
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Sorry, the Atkins diet still doesn't work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; By Michael Fumento
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; || &gt; Nutritionists have long said that any fad diet can shed weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; quickly, but the pounds are soon regained. Now two studies in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; prestigious medical journal have caused a media maelstrom. They show
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; that the Atkins regimen can shed weight quickly . . . but the pounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; are soon regained. Fad diets still don't work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Both studies appeared in The New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; with each randomly dividing subjects into two groups. In each study,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; one group was told to reduce caloric intake while the other wasn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; expressly told to cut calories, but rather instructed to keep
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; carbohydrate intake extremely low as dictated by the late Dr. Robert
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Atkins's books.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; One, conducted at the Philadelphia Veterans Administration Hospital,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; lasted six months, comprised subjects with an initial average weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; of about 215 pounds. The other was conducted at three different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; centers, lasted 12 months, and comprised subjects with an initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; average weight of about 290 pounds.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; The six-month study found that Atkins dieters lost weight at about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; twice the rate as the higher-carb group - for two months. Thereafter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; neither group lost much weight. By the end of six months, the Atkins
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; dieters, however, had still managed to keep off about twice as much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; weight as the higher-carb group - for what it was worth. The average
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; loss was a mere 13 pounds from that original 290.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Further, the 12-month study indicates even that was probably a doomed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; effort. Here again, the Atkins group lost considerably more weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; for the first half year. But thereafter not only did it begin packing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; the pounds back on, it did so faster than the higher-carb group.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Ultimately, concluded the researchers, &quot;the differences were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; significant at the end one of year.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Reporters who read only the press releases presented articles such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; AP's, &quot;Pair of Studies Vindicate Atkins Diet,&quot; while others who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; actually bothered to read the studies themselves - or at least the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; conclusions - came up with stories leading to quite different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; headlines, such as Reuters &quot;Atkins Diet May Be No Better Than Just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Cutting Fat.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; &quot;The probable explanation&quot; for the early weight loss, said the chief
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; researcher of the 12-month study (Gary Foster of the University of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Pennsylvania), is that it &quot;gives people a framework to eat fewer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; calories, since most of the choices in this culture are carbohydrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; driven.&quot; He told me: &quot;You're left eating a lot of fat, and you get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; tired of that.&quot; So the Atkins plan is merely a low-calorie diet in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; disguise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Soon though, Atkins dieters become so starved for carbohydrates that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; they either start cheating or quit the plan altogether. In fact, both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; studies were plagued by high dropout rates from all sets of dieters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; The only weight-control regimens that work for life require both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; eating in moderation and exercise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; &quot;The Atkins diet produces weight loss, as does the grapefruit diet,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; the rotation diet, and every other fad diet out there,&quot; Foster's co-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; researcher James Hill of the director of the University of Colorado
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Center for Human Nutrition in Denver. &quot;I haven't seen any data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; anywhere saying Atkins is better than these other diets for weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; loss.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; The NEJM findings also belied the assertions in a massively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; publicized New York Times Magazine cover story last year by Gary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Taubes that rocketed Atkins diet-book sales into the stratosphere. It
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; | &gt; also landed Taubes his own $700,000 book contract.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; In the article, Taubes ignored red flags in the Atkins book that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; flapped as if in a hurricane. In addition to its something-for-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; nothing weight-loss promise, Atkins also insisted his diet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; relieves &quot;fatigue, irritability, depression, trouble concentrating,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; headaches, insomnia, dizziness, joint and muscle aches, heartburn,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; colitis, premenstrual syndrome, and water retention and bloating&quot; -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; in short, it does everything but walk the dog.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Worse, Taubes ignored a mass of published and peer-reviewed studies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; showing low-carbohydrate diets to be ineffective for long-term weight
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; loss, such as a review in the April 2001 Journal of the American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Dietetic Association (JADA) of &quot;all studies identified&quot; that looked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; at diet nutrient composition and weight loss.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; It claimed to have found over 200, with &quot;no studies of the health and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; nutrition effects of popular diets in the published literature&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; excluded. In some, subjects were put on &quot;ad libitum&quot; diets, meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; they were allowed to eat as much as they wanted as long as they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; consumed fat, protein, and carbohydrates in the directed proportions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; In others, subjects were put on controlled-calorie diets that also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; had directed nutrient proportions. The conclusion: Those who ate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; least fat carried the least fat.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Instead, Taubes put his own spin on five then-unpublished research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; efforts.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; &quot;The results of all five of these studies are remarkably consistent.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Subjects on some form of the Atkins diet,&quot; he insisted, &quot;lost twice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; the weight as the subjects on the low-fat, low-calorie diets.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; In the article, Taubes cited five then-unpublished studies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; claiming: &quot;The results of all five of these studies are remarkably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; consistent. Subjects on some form of the Atkins diet,&quot; he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; insisted, &quot;lost twice the weight as the subjects on the low-fat, low-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; calorie diets.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; But two of those are the ones discussed here. Somehow, &quot;The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; differences were not significant at the end of one year&quot; doesn't seem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; to support &quot;lost twice the weight.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; A third of the five studies lasted only 12 weeks, which these two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; studies indicate to be obviously of no use. A fourth, according to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; chief author Eric Westman at Duke University, does back Atkins. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; then again, Atkins backs him. The Atkins Center has an open-ended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; commitment to fully support Westman's work.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; The last of the five studies is from the University of Cincinnati,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; where co-author Randy Seeley of the university's Obesity Research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Center says the Atkins cohort did have twice the weight loss at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; end of the six months. But his explanation is similar to Foster's, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; more colorful. &quot;If you're only allowed to shop in two aisles of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; grocery store, does it matter which two they are?&quot; he asks.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Nevertheless, at least there seemed no evidence that all that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; saturated fat in the Atkins diet increases the risk of heart disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; In neither NEJM study did the Atkins dieters have increased LDL (low-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; density lipoprotein or &quot;bad cholesterol,&quot;) and the 12-month one even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; found a small increase in HDL high-density lipoprotein or &quot;good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; cholesterol.&quot; Finally the triglycerides (fatty compounds in blood) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; the Atkins dieters decreased. Lower triglyceride levels have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; linked to lower rates of heart disease.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; But not so fast, says Robert H. Eckel, professor of medicine at the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; University of Colorado Health Sciences Center, where Hill works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Eckel, who coauthored an accompanying commentary in the NEJM, says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; one probable reason for improved blood readings in the Atkins cohorts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; is that they did have greater weight loss, at least part of the time,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; in both studies. &quot;Generally when people lose weight, both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; triglycerides and HDL improve,&quot; he told me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Indeed, even the higher-carb losers showed some improvement in both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; measurements.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; As to HDL, he says, not all HDL is created equal. Just as we once
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; thought all cholesterol was bad, there is now evidence that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; some &quot;good&quot; HDL may not be good after all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; Finally, says Eckel, epidemiological studies indicate that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; triglycerides appear to have only a mild direct impact on heart
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; disease; rather they are a marker for other factors that do impact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; it, just as open umbrellas are not the cause of rain but markers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; thereof.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; The Atkins Center was overjoyed that the new studies may indicate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; regimen isn't dangerous. How peculiar when the most you can say for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; the best-selling fad-diet book of all time is that it probably
</em><br>
<em>&gt; | &gt; doesn't kill people.
