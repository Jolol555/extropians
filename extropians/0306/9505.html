<em>&gt; This is way too long already. But there's my most recent idea.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Emlyn
</em><br>
<p>Good idea, it extends the ordinary idea &quot;internet based global scheduler&quot;
<br>
with all the wireless gizmos. As a software developer, i have developed
<br>
several single user and company wide calendering and scheduling systems. I
<br>
also have contact to two former employees from the latest and largest
<br>
scenduler project we made, so i could put together an experienced team in
<br>
very short time. ( A team that had a track record, as well as deep knowledge
<br>
with this kind of systems )
<br>
<p>Rough plan for action would be ( i think )
<br>
<p>1) Get established as one of the widely used internet based scheduling
<br>
solutions. ( make it free, make it superior to yahoo calender and others -
<br>
this should not be that difficult )
<br>
2) ramp it up by supporting everything internet enabled and wireless ( this
<br>
is technically quite easy if you have it in mind when creating the system)
<br>
3) when half  the western world are customers, sell out to someone who wants
<br>
the eyeballs, or figure some way to earn a respectacle revenue from the
<br>
service.
<br>
<p>If someone was interested in funding, i can have the initial developer team
<br>
and the first generation of an infrastructure ready in months. It can be run
<br>
as a project that scales up slowly, keeping cost down until there is a
<br>
working product.
<br>
<p>The only developer team i can think of that would be more up to the task
<br>
would be the developers at microsoft who are behind outlook. They probably
<br>
know exactly how to do it right from scratch if they had a second chance -
<br>
and they probably have quite a lot of resources backing their efforts. I'd
<br>
be surprised if not microsoft launches a service like you describe within
<br>
the next 3-4 years anyway. It'd be handy to have a runnoing one, that you
<br>
could sell to them.
<br>
<p>Of course, if You pull it off, the reward when selling the company or being
<br>
taken over would most probably be in the triple digit million euro range.
<br>
( look at similar companies and their worth )
<br>
<p>/Dennis
