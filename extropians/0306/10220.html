<p>
I was just wondering if anyone has thought about this:
<br>
The basic properties of all of the elements of the periodic table have been know for some time. If we had a computer with sufficient processing power, couldn't we have simulation software that could tell us pretty much every chemical compound/material that could be made? This would eleminate the trial and error approach and solve possible every disease!
<br>
I began thinking about this when I was watching a program that discussed how snake venom was being used to develop treatment for diseases. I estimated that there are so many possible chemicals out there in nature that we could probably never get to a point where we could try them all on everything. 
<br>
I know that we currently don;t have the processing power to do this, but does anyone on this board know roughly how much processing power we would need? 
<br>
<p>Anyways, it was just a thought, amongst others......
