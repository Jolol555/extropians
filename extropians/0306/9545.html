Passing this along, from a friend of mine involved in the War against the

Dear Friend:
As incredible as it may seem, U.S. District Court Judge Charles Breyer
sentenced medical marijuana activist Ed Rosenthal to only one day in prison
yesterday, allowing him to walk free because of credit for time already
served.
Back in January, an Oakland jury convicted Ed of growing more than 100
marijuana plants, which should have landed him in prison for a mandatory
minimum of five years -- and possibly as many as 40 years.
Ed grew marijuana for seriously ill people who are allowed to use it under
California's medical marijuana law, doing so with the express authorization
of the Oakland city government. But Judge Breyer prohibited Ed from
presenting any evidence involving medical marijuana to the jury, which
convicted him because they thought he was a large-scale marijuana
distributor. When the jury learned that all medical marijuana facts had been
withheld from them, a majority of jurors publicly repudiated their verdict
and apologized to Rosenthal.
When a jury publicly rejects its own verdict, and a federal judge subverts
Congress' system of mandatory minimum sentences to let a marijuana grower go
free, it is clear we have reached a turning point. Today marks the beginning
of the end of the federal war on medical marijuana patients.
There are three things you can do to help the Marijuana Policy Project use
this victory to help change federal law:
   1. Please visit <a href="http://www.mpp.org/USA">http://www.mpp.org/USA</a> to fax a pre-written letter to
your three members of Congress, asking them to support  legislation that
would let other medical marijuana growers go free, just like Ed did
yesterday.
   2. Please forward this message to your family and friends and urge them
to visit <a href="http://www.mpp.org/USA">http://www.mpp.org/USA</a> so that they, too, can add their voices to
our cause.
   3. If you are really motivated, please visit <a href="http://www.mpp.org/USA">http://www.mpp.org/USA</a> 
to grab a pre-written letter-to-the-editor about Ed's sentencing to submit
as your own to your local newspapers.
Now is the time to act. The &quot;Truth in Trials&quot; medical marijuana bill (H.R.
1717 -- <a href="http://www.mpp.org/USA/bills_690.html">http://www.mpp.org/USA/bills_690.html</a> ) in Congress already has 34
sponsors, and we estimate we could have more than 50 sponsors almost
immediately if you and MPP's other 31,000 e-mail subscribers use our Web
system to fax letters to your members of Congress. In addition, a wave of
faxes to Capitol Hill right now will strengthen our case that Congress
should hold a first-ever hearing for medical marijuana legislation this
summer. Medical marijuana patients and supporters marked Rosenthal's
sentencing yesterday by protesting in front of the local district offices of
25 members of the U.S. House of Representatives who represent states with
medical marijuana laws but who have not yet cosponsored H.R. 1717. The chief
of staff for one of these House members called us yesterday afternoon, angry
that MPP supporters were distributing flyers that said the representative
&quot;thinks that medical marijuana patients should be sent to federal prison&quot; --
right outside of her congressional office. We told the chief of staff that
the protests would end when her boss co-sponsors our legislation. Ed
Rosenthal's sentencing and the wave of 25 protests generated national media
coverage. A large story on page two of The Washington Post quoted MPP
Director of Communications Bruce Mirken, who was also quoted in The New York
Times. I was quoted in the San Francisco Chronicle, while Associated Press,
Reuters, and Agence France-Presse wire stories about the verdict ran in
newspapers all over the world. Please see <a href="http://www.mpp.org/USA">http://www.mpp.org/USA</a> for the
news articles and to take action today. Thank you ... Sincerely, Rob Kampia
Executive Director Marijuana Policy Project Washington, D.C. P.S. Please
visit <a href="http://www.mpp.org/USA/donate.html">http://www.mpp.org/USA/donate.html</a> to donate to our lobbying work on
Capitol Hill.
