<p><em>&gt; The psychological problem that most people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against uploading, of course, is that of &quot;being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inside a computer&quot;, or of knowing that one is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just on a silicon chip.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps its because I haven't read enough about it, but,
<br>
the reservation, I have against uploading, and also
<br>
cryonics is that I just not convinced that, appearances
<br>
not withstanding, the me that goes in, will be the me 
<br>
that comes out.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Perhaps it is a bit different between uploading and
<br>
cryonics because uploading changes the matter substrate
<br>
on which one perceives one exists more radically.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Let's stipulate that the means to do a complete atomic 
<br>
level recreation of all parts of a cryonically preserved
<br>
person, including the sense of self, and a consistent set
<br>
of memories from one's early childhood up until the 
<br>
moment one voluntarily consented to undergo a cryonic
<br>
procedure. Like consenting to a life saving general 
<br>
anaesthetic. Let's assume the nanotech is good enough
<br>
to rebuild the exact atomic replica of person X.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My current sense is that, to everyone else person X 
<br>
*will* appear to be the *same* person both before 
<br>
and after. Person X prime, (Xprime), will perceive himself
<br>
to be person X, but it seems to me that neither Xprime's 
<br>
opinion, nor the opinions of other people are fully 
<br>
satisfactory when one puts oneself in the place of person
<br>
X considering undergoing cryonics or uploading. It seems
<br>
that person X's predisposition to cryonics or uploading is
<br>
something of a leap of faith or perhaps the sense of having
<br>
nothing little to lose.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
How can X know that Xprime is any more than a very 
<br>
complete copy? The same process that reproduced one 
<br>
Xprime from the information in X could also produced 
<br>
multiple copies.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Let me try and use what seems to be an appropriate
<br>
analogy. A candle flame, 'energy' can be transferred or
<br>
spread from one candle (a matter substrate) to another
<br>
without being extinguished. The flame might also be 
<br>
extinguished on the original substrate and relit. Or with
<br>
nanotechnology we may rebuilt a candle that, atom by
<br>
atom, is the same as the original candle and relight it,
<br>
but the *particular* flame, the *particular* energy flow 
<br>
on the substrate will still have been interrupted. Indeed
<br>
it will have been snuffed out. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
It seems to me that &quot;death&quot; may be analogous to the
<br>
candle flame (i.e. a continuous flow of energy dancing 
<br>
on a matter substrate). Because we eat and exchange 
<br>
atoms throughout our lives the analogy could be 
<br>
extended to say wax is added to the candle whilst the 
<br>
flame continues to burn. But, extinguish the flame, stop
<br>
the continuous energy flow, and perhaps you extinguish
<br>
the continuing phenomena, the 'super-consciousness',
<br>
(to coin a term covering conscious and unconscious
<br>
processes) that are the subjective experience of life. I
<br>
guess what I'm positing is that, one's life, one's self,
<br>
may depends on continuity. Perhaps something
<br>
important to the identity of a person is lost if the energy
<br>
flow or 'super-conscious' is interrupted. Actually the 
<br>
consciousness is interrupted sometimes in life but not
<br>
along with the unconscious so far as I know. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Following a successful cryonics procedure everyone,
<br>
including the reconstructed X, Xprime, thinks X has
<br>
been preserved, this I freely concede. But X the 
<br>
original, is no longer around or in a position to confirm
<br>
that X the original, X's super-consciousness, X's self,
<br>
rather than an excellent replication has actually emerged
<br>
from the process. 
<br>
<p>So, does it finally come down to a &quot;leap of faith&quot; on behalf
<br>
of the potential cryonaut or the potential upload that
<br>
*they*, X, will *actually* survive?
<br>
<p>Or, and this I would like to be convinced of, are there in
<br>
fact deeper levels of understanding still available to an
<br>
inquiring mind, *this* side of the cryonics or upload 
<br>
procedure, perhaps in physics, or perhaps around 
<br>
(or avoiding) the fuzzy phenomenon I've termed the
<br>
super-conscious, that would allow one to more rationally
<br>
avoid the sense that the prospective cryonaut or upload
<br>
are undertaking a one way journey that is in many ways
<br>
every bit as much a &quot;leap of faith&quot; for them as the &quot;leaps
<br>
of faith&quot; taken by people of religious viewpoints since
<br>
time immemorial?
