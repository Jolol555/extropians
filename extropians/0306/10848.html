<p>I don't *know* the situation in detail with Secret Patents,
<br>
not because it is indeterminable, just because I haven't
<br>
put in sufficient time to understand it yet. I thought others
<br>
on the list  might already have some insights and/or interest.
<br>
<p>Given the size of the economic and intellectual engine that is
<br>
the USA, it is it's approach to patents and IP that is likely 
<br>
to have the greatest influence on the realisation times of 
<br>
technologies that most transhumanists are interested in.
<br>
<p>Making nuclear weapons (technology) unpatentable to Joe
<br>
Public is not surprising. And in comparison biotech seems
<br>
relatively benign, but I can imagine that an argument could be
<br>
made that publishing details in patents concerned with nanotech,
<br>
quantum computing and especially cryptography, *could*
<br>
have military and national security implications and not be
<br>
in the national interest. 
<br>
<p>Because export prohibitions on cryptography seemed to
<br>
have had little effect in the case of  Phil Zimmerman and PGP
<br>
I will be interested to see if the DoD or NSA have some
<br>
means to block dissemination of technological information
<br>
(such as in secret patents) in quantum cryptography. 
<br>
<p>On nanotech, I think, I recall reading that the Foresight 
<br>
Institute has been involved in liaison work aimed at shoring 
<br>
up incentives to encourage nano designs. Good proactive
<br>
stuff if true. I hope it can head off pressure to over-legislate.
