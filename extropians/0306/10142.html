</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; (possibly a citizen of the state in question) who didn't like that,
</em><br>

<em>&gt; I think Texas has reserved the power to fragment into several

</em><br>
<em>&gt; speak.
</em><br>
<p>NH retains the right to seceed, as well as to launch new revolution, in
<br>
its state constitution, which predates the US constitution (we were the
<br>
first to declare independence and the first state to have a
<br>
constitution). Ours is the last to retain such features.
<br>
<p>While states that were formed from territories and formally annexed
<br>
would have to get acts of congress to de-annex (they would also have to
<br>
remove provisions from their state constitutions that declare them to
<br>
recognise the imminent power of the US constitution and government),
<br>
states that were original ratifiers were never annexed, since we were
<br>
founding members (NH, for example, was the 9th ratifier and thus is
<br>
responsible for the US Constitution being 'active') since you can't
<br>
'annex' yourself to yourself. The original states (the 13 colonies and
<br>
Vermont) were all independent countries (as was Texas) prior to joining
<br>
the US, though unlike Texas, they were never annexed.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, there are other situations. Part of northern NH was once
<br>
an independent country, the Republic of Indian Stream, up into the
<br>
1830's, when Britain and the US finally resolved vagaries resulting
<br>
from poor surveying used in the Treaty of Paris.
