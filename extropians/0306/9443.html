</em><br>
<p>You seem to believe a model of conversation wherein
<br>
people will speak the truth unless social pressure
<br>
forces them to conform to a particular party line.  But
<br>
there can be social pressure to be outrageous as well,
<br>
as you demonstrate above.  And the absence of social
<br>
pressure is not the key to truth; social pressure
<br>
often helps the cause of truth, by making people pause
<br>
before saying something untrue.
<br>
<p>It is far from clear what the ideal social context is
<br>
for inducing a group like this to best learn truth,
<br>
and to credibly communicate that to outsiders.  But a
<br>
quick survey of groups that are considered reliable
<br>
sources doesn't suggest that the best route is to try
<br>
to say crazy-sounding things as often as possible.
