&lt;&lt;The nation's leading environmental groups can barely control their
<br>
enthusiasm. ''We're bullish on wind,'' says Kert Davies, research
<br>
director of Greenpeace USA. ''Everybody has to ante up in the fight.''
<br>
... 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Well, this is a new day.  I and the director of Greenpeace agree on
<br>
something.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Robert had an objection that I kinda punted: that his detroit doesn't
<br>
run
<br>
on electricity.  My notion is that a transition would be gradual enough
<br>
that major pain would be averted.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So now I ask, if the current low interest rates hold and wind power
<br>
keeps
<br>
going in at the current rate (they are building them like hell out
<br>
here), we
<br>
know who the winners are.  But who loses?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I want to ignore for the time being those who hold stock in the
<br>
alternatives.  
<br>
Someone mentioned climate change downwind of the windmills.  What is 
<br>
that?  I haven't heard of anything like that, altho it stands to reason
<br>
if we are
<br>
extracting energy from the wind, the entropy of the wind must somehow
<br>
increase.  Anyone know?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I lived in the southern taxifornia desert for several years.  Some times
<br>
of
<br>
the year the wind howls thru there with such force and consistency, that
<br>
death would be a sweet relief.  Any change in that weather pattern as a
<br>
result of windmills would have to be for the better.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The bird people don't like the idea.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I can see where pilots might not like the idea, since they would face
<br>
additional danger should their engine quit over a vast wind farm.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There have been claims that windmills are noisy.  I often ride up to
<br>
Altamont Pass near here and pull over on a breezy day.  The windmills
<br>
do make some noise, but not that much.  If one is a km away, one 
<br>
cannot hear them.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Some have said that a hilltop covered with windmills is unsightly, but
<br>
I beg to differ.  I find them very sightly.  On a windy day when they
<br>
are
<br>
all spinning like hell, generating all that power and all that beautiful
<br>
money, they are quite scenic. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
OK, so I know who wins, but who loses (besides the bird fans and pilots)
<br>
<p>if we start poking windmills into the ground like weeds?
<br>
