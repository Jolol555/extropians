Paul Grant commented:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; And the same could be said of Saddam.  However, Saddams moral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goals, that of remaining a murderous dictators, are far more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; repugnant that the Coalitions moral goals.  Do you agree?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hardly; both are seeking to maintain power.
</em><br>
<p>Is a dictator seeking to maintain power as legitimate as a democratic
<br>
constitutional republic seeking to maintain power?  (since you clearly
<br>
assert they are both only attempting to maintain power) Your statement is
<br>
yet another example of the ethics I find surprising to be present on this
<br>
mailing list.  You are asserting, basically, that no form of government is
<br>
any more legitimate than any other, and all are equally not legitimate.
<br>
Considering so many governments on this planet are the opposite of
<br>
extropian, I wonder how you can draw such a conclusions.  Do you acknowledge
<br>
that some forms are government are more legitimate than others?  Or do you
<br>
insist, as some libertarians do, that absolutely no state is legitimate
<br>
unless it is perfect, or under no circumstances is any state legitmate, and
<br>
thus all states are equally illigetmate?  If that is the case, let me ask
<br>
you this, would you perfer to live under a democratic consitutional republic
<br>
or under Saddam Hussein?  Why?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Saddam had backed down, there would have been no senseless
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; waste of time, energy, money, goodwill, and ~20 million
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Iraqis would have been freed without one drop of Blood being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; shed.  Yet you and others still insist the coalition bears
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the moral culpability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was planning on releasing this to the press Monday morning, but....
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;President Bush.  It pleases me to inform you that you should abdicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your thron...OFFICE prior to the end of the week.  If you do so you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ensure that there is &quot;no senseless waste of time, energy, money,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goodwill, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ~288 million Americans would have been freed without one drop of Blood
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shed. If you do not vacate your office immediately, I (and history)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will hold you morally culpabable.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Is a dictatorship under you a form of goverment that is as legitiamte as the
<br>
existing democratic constituional republic currently present?  (no, it isnt,
<br>
in case you are not sure)  The fact the you designate this as an example
<br>
illustrates the little time you have spent considering the validity of
<br>
states and the implications of your ethical ideas.  The onus of moral
<br>
culpability lies on the presider of the least legitimate state.  A
<br>
dictatorship is certainly the least legitimate there is, least extropic, and
<br>
most immoral.  I am surprised this even made it to the list as a 'counter'
<br>
argument to my comments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Again, just as Emlyn, you ignore the Gulf War I, in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Saddam invaded another country we agreed to defend.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; resolutions calling for the end of the open fighting in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conflict were the ones that were violated and instigated res
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 1441.  Saddam did nothing less than break the agreements that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ended Gulf War I.  Yet we were the invaders?  Never mind the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; multiple other compelling reasons to oust Saddam.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, just in case you didn't know, Kuwait was originally part of Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like Sudan was part of Egypt.  In point of fact, Iraq refused to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kuwait as an independent country until 2 years *AFTER* the gulf war.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So as far as I'm concerned, Saddam didn't invade anybody.
</em><br>
<p>Amazing, so because Saddam, a murderous tyrant, does not recognize a group
<br>
of individuals who of their own free will choose to leave his country and
<br>
form their own, they are not a legitimate country?  Countries exist only as
<br>
collections of individuals, and deserve no existence beyond the collective
<br>
acceptance of its citizens.  If a group of citizens chooses to excise
<br>
themselves from an oppresive dictatorial government, they DO NOT NEED HIS
<br>
PERMISSION *or* recognition to form a legitimate state!!!  What system of
<br>
ethics do you prescribe to, the 'Dictator has final say over everything'
<br>
system?  Do you think the people of Kuwait feel Saddam 'didnt invide
<br>
anyone'?
<br>
<p>He was
<br>
<em>&gt; putting down a long-standing rebellion when the rebels invited in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign
</em><br>
<em>&gt; power because they were scared of the consequences.
</em><br>
<p>I wonder what consequences they might have been scared of?  Kuwait was
<br>
internationally recognized and a member of the United Nations before Saddam
<br>
took power in Iraq.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This particular
<br>
<em>&gt; scene
</em><br>
<em>&gt; With foreign powers and psuedo independent states etc has been played
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Repeatedly through history.  I can't technically fault the man for his
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;invasion&quot;;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Kuwait would have expanded his capabilities.  'course he got his butt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spanked by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US, but that's another story.
</em><br>
<p>Again, I am flabbergasted, please explain to me what right a dictator has to
<br>
invade another country?  Oh, yeah, thats right, he just need not recognize
<br>
that country as a seperate one, and thus can do whatever he pleases!
<br>
<p>Your statements do not seem to coincide with the idea of being an extropian.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I am out of my mind?  I have still yet to hear you say that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no one has the right to be a dictator.  As an extropian, can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you not even acknowledge the basic moral premise that no one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; has the right to be a dictator?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It *is* technically better than anarchy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;grin&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You did not answer the question, does anyone have the right to be a
<br>
dictator, yes or no.  Yet again, someone who evades the answer.
