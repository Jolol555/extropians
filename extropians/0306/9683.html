<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Historically if there has been a personal upside to atheism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the atheist I can't see it. It seems to me that not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believing in things without evidence would normally be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; benefit to the individual. But not believing in that which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gives one's contemporaries hope
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would be a detriment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; MAYBE JUST THE TRUTH IS SUFFICIENT IN ITSELF?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't think so. &quot;The truth&quot; doesn't come at us or yield itself in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one big chunk.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think the individual's pursuit of &quot;truth&quot; amounts to a utilitarian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pursuit. Without a subjective basis and bias towards seeing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; world in an ordered and consistent way I doubt sentient beings
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would bother too much with just any particular objective
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; factoid or even with grand unified theories.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think even the interest in objective facts like 1 + 1 = 2 is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; subjective one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, 1+1=2 and whole of maths relies on the identity statement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1 = 1 .....  but maths says nothing about the world (if you take a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fictionalist view of  it as I do). 
</em><br>
<p>I agree maths &quot;says&quot; nothing about the world, in the sense that 
<br>
clocks don't usually &quot;say&quot; anything about the time. Interpretation of
<br>
the symbols is an active process. But my point was that maths is
<br>
useful. We are able to do maths and reason and use language and
<br>
these capabilities generally confer an evolutionary advantage. 
<br>
<p>Arriving at the position of atheism however, if one lived in the time
<br>
of Hume, looks to me, from what I imagine as the personal human
<br>
standpoint of Hume to have been a little too much reasoning for his
<br>
own subjective good. I find harder to explain *why* someone 
<br>
like Hume didn't rationalise away an unpleasant personal truth.
<br>
Or maybe he did. I don't know Hume's personal story that well. 
<br>
<p>But I am assuming, possibly incorrectly, that being an atheist 
<br>
because that position made sense to Hume on intellectual grounds
<br>
would still have come at a subjective cost for him because it would
<br>
have meant (I am assuming) that he would have accepted that he
<br>
personally would be annihilated at death. I don't think Hume could
<br>
have put much stock in cryonics, uploading or radical life extension.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, EXISTENCE truth claims require (preferably)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; verification or proof .... 
</em><br>
<p>If you mean to say that the assertion that A is true requires
<br>
verification or proof, I agree, but only provisionally. 
<br>
<p>Someone else's assertion of A being true has to be *important* 
<br>
enough to me for me to care whether it is true or not.
<br>
<p>Whether &quot;God&quot; exists fits into the category of being worth 
<br>
caring about, if one learns from one's childhood (as most in
<br>
the judeo-christian tradition do), that personal annihilation is
<br>
avoided at death because of a set of ideas of in which the 
<br>
existence of a particular type of God is central.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; MVT on the other hand requires no suspension of disbelief,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and anyone can inspect (if no longer experiment on) the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pineal eye of a sphaenodon. The statement &quot;Sphenodon lives&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is true, whereas the statement &quot;God lives/ exists&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unsupported by fact.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry you lost me at MVT.
<br>
