<em>&gt; &gt;We have a penny.  We toss it.  What are the odds that we'll get heads?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;The answer:  0
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Zero?  Yes.  This is very counterintuitive, admittedly, particularly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;statisticians.  However, the truth is there are no &quot;odds&quot; here at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Penny tossing is deterministic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that using determinism in this way is putting up a smoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; screen in addition to missing the large picture of how scientists
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intuitively do science. You have a real experiment, so it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physical, and all propositions are testable. How do you define
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determinism for this system? Your determinism is based on a model of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some physics, is it not? No matter how 'deterministic' something may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be, your prediction for the outcome of the coin toss is based on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; data and a model and what other information you have about that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system. A Bayes discussion is always in the realm of epistemology,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i.e. how we know what we know.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  In fact, what &quot;bzr&quot; says is NOT counterintuitive to statisticians.
<br>
Anybody who knows anything about statistics knows that it only applies to a
<br>
large-enough randomly distributed population.  Out of a hundred coin-flips,
<br>
50% will be heads and 50% will be tails.  You can't argue statistics for a
<br>
single event.  This is a common error (also found on extropians) of taking
<br>
statistics that apply to a group and trying to apply them to a single
<br>
individual who is a member of that group.  This isn't valid.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Bayes Theorem is only a multiplication rule of probability theory,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which shows a relationship between a posterior probability, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likelihood of data to model, and prior probability. The prior
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability and posterior probability are not necessarily related in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. These concepts show just a different relationship to the data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be analyzed. The Bayesian methodologies approach the scientific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inference from &quot;first principles&quot;, grasping an n-parametric event
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directly with an n-dimensional posterior probability distribution.
</em><br>
<p>This is a good example to remember.  People often think that new ideas
<br>
completely invalidate everything that came before.  More likely, new ideas
<br>
evolve our understanding into better models.  Thus Newtonian physics still
<br>
works at the macro level for many situations, we just have more information
<br>
about more complex systems.  E=MC^2 works for stationary objects, but more
<br>
complicated formulas are required for more complex calculations.  Statistics
<br>
is still valid for some things, but the real world gets more complicated.
<br>
Bayes Theorem is a more complete framework, not a rejection of previous
<br>
mathematics.
