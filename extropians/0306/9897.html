<p>I was skeptical also, until I learned that I was merely believing in a
<br>
religion promulgated by the high priests of Wall Street. 
<br>
<p>It took 12 years as professional investment advisor for me to see the light,
<br>
so I won't expect to convert anyone to market atheism in this thread. But I
<br>
will share my thoughts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It treats all

</em><br>
<em>&gt; information and the same response to that information.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; None of those three assumptions is correct.  Humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotional decision makers.  There are indeed differences in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the information investors have access to.  And given the same
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information, different investors would make different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decisions based upon their individual analysis, risk
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tolerance, and of course that emotional factor listed above.
</em><br>
<p>I reasoned the same as you, but unfortunately it is impossible to prove your
<br>
assumptions correct in the financial markets. For some reason the market
<br>
behaves as if humans are rational decision makers. 
<br>
<p>For example the best prediction of a stock's future price is a function of
<br>
the stock's beta (a measure of its volatility, or more accurately, its
<br>
sensitivity to the volatility of the general market). People pay less for
<br>
high beta stocks because people are rational enough to know to they should
<br>
pay less for investments with greater uncertainty. It is for this reason
<br>
that high beta stocks outperform the market averages. If you're willing to
<br>
assume the higher risks of high beta stocks, you can buy them at a
<br>
substantial discount to their expected future values.
