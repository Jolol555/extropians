<em>&gt; &gt; 50%),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Can you quote Chinnery on that?
</em><br>
<p>Sure -- though not verbatim, of course, because he doesn't understand
<br>
it.  Page 572 left in the JTB paper: &quot;The feedback mechanism associated
<br>
with alpha acts to maintain the population of wild-type mtDNA near the
<br>
target level of Nopt.&quot;  In other words, with 50/50 heteroplasmy the
<br>
steady-state total mtDNA copy number will be twice what it is when no
<br>
mutant mtDNA is present, so that the same number of wild-type molecules
<br>
are present.  Similarly on p577 right, &quot;Proliferation of mtDNA does
<br>
succeed in mainitaining the number of wild-type mtDNA at nearly optimal
<br>
levels, but at the expense of generating a large number of mutated
<br>
mtDNA.&quot;
<br>
<p>- ----------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Thresholds don't help re
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the former, because in Chinnery's model the only reason there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threshold is that there's a maximum number of mt genomes in total (wt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plus mutant).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### I didn't get this one. Chinnery specifically predicts biochemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threshold effects for mutations with high E (the efficiency parameter).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This would not be dependent on any maximum number of mt genomes, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does not predict lots of proliferation at modest heteroplasmy (see Fig
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7 and page 578 in the J.Theor Biol article).
</em><br>
<p>Don't you mean low E?  High E means mild mutations, low E means severe
<br>
mutations.  p578 says there is a threshold effect for severe mutations.
<br>
The threshold is biochemical in a way, but it's still a cap on the total
<br>
number of mt genomes -- namely, Nopt times alpha for E=0.  (E=0 is the
<br>
only physiologically reevant case in aging, because all COX-negative
<br>
fibres contain clonal deletions - see Aiken's work.)
<br>
<p>- ---------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; and (2) it predicts (for parameters chosen to give the observed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; number of COX-negative cells) a lot more heteroplasmic cells than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; homoplasmic (or very nearly) mutant cells.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ### Can you quote him?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; See fig 5 and p 580, where he says that within his model the levels of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutations and COX negativity can vary independently of each other.
</em><br>
<p>Yeah -- at least I managed to get a big caveat included there to do
<br>
with the fact that the single cited study of COX-negativity with low
<br>
mutation load was in cell culture (where clonal expansion doesn't even
<br>
happen).  But I was not talking above about the JTB paper, but rather
<br>
about Elson et al, AJHG 68:802, in which essentially the same model is
<br>
used to simulate the accumulation of mutations that have occurred
<br>
spontaneously (i.e. at an initial copy number of 1).  This is the one
<br>
in which he asserts that a paper from his own group (Brierley 1998)
<br>
contradicts my 1997 model when in fact it robustly supports it....
<br>
But back to the point: see its Fig 1A and legend, which says that
<br>
three cells showed &quot;a significant expansion&quot; against only one going
<br>
to fixation.
