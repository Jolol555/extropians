I was talking in general terms, however if you want to be specific, let's
<br>
talk a bit about IT people.
<br>
I'll go back to 1993. I was 4 years out of high-school paying child support
<br>
and broke. I had always been good with computers, but had yet to develop
<br>
into the person I am now who tries to see the BIG picture.
<br>
I decided to go back to school for a computer science degree. In 1997 I
<br>
received my degree. There were jobs-a-plenty. BUT, there were many many many
<br>
people working to get the same education.
<br>
By the time the tech market went bust, there was a glutton of people capable
<br>
of performing the same job as myself. This gave us a double-whammy! Less
<br>
jobs, more people capable of doing those jobs! Also with the internet came
<br>
the ability to do these jobs from afar.
<br>
Now, I should have seen this coming. I knew the capabilities of the coming
<br>
technologies. I knew how everyone and their brother was going to school for
<br>
some kind of IT training. I was also developing my BIG picture abilities
<br>
which have nothing to do with IT.
<br>
Now when I look at it, I can project into the future. Here is what I see:
<br>
A limited period where IT jobs will be performed worldwide by the lowest
<br>
bidders. This will be followed by software and hardware that makes IT
<br>
positions worthless.
<br>
The only IT money left will be for those who design and implement the new
<br>
technologies as they are developed, and those who market and sell it. It
<br>
only makes sense that your only choice if you wish to stay in IT is to
<br>
increase your education in the field, or move into a sales position.
<br>
Of course, when AI is developed, maybe the software will design and sell
<br>
itself!

<p><p><em>&gt; Kevin Freels stated:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;In the future, people in this country are going to be faced with a
</em><br>
choice. To become educated, or to starve. Hopefully, the majority of people
<br>
choose the former. The argument that cheap labor overseas is going to kill
<br>
our economy is just garbage. People can move into the country, or jobs can
<br>
move out. It doesn;t matter. Eventually, economic expansion will improve the
<br>
lives of everyone. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The educated are the ones taking it up the ass, nowadays, not the blue
</em><br>
collar folks. Or don't you consider developers, and network admins educated?
<br>
These are the folks whose jobs have been and are being off-shored. You
<br>
stated that people can move into the country. Should Americans move into
<br>
Brazil or India to follow these jobs? You said eventually the economic
<br>
expansion will improves the lives of everyone.  Is this before or after the
<br>
US economy is debstablized? Companies which used to make products and sell
<br>
services are now prone to merely squeeze costs and off-shore jobs, merely to
<br>
deceive their stockhholders, into thinking that saved costs is the same as
<br>
growth .
