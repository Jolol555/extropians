<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've not included it here, but Michael Dickey posted a quite emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; response to my reply to him. Nothing wrong with emotions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I find it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extraordinarily difficult to respond to. I feel that my comments have not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been interpreted with the subtlety that many of them deserve, and am not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about to try to correct that, point by point. This communication is very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clearly a tar baby, who I refuse to beat further.
</em><br>
<p>My apologies if I have mis-interpreted what you are saying, I make no
<br>
intentional effort to do so, but when you say things such as 'Wars always
<br>
result in loss of liberties' (paraphrasing) I must take issue with such
<br>
comments, as it seems obvious to me that WWI, WWII and the Cold War all
<br>
resulted in significantly greater liberties for the entire world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Michael accuses me of, amongst other things, being a moral relativist. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't think that I am; I think that I have some strong moral principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which feel absolute. However, I don't understand what they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grounded on -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe logically that they can have no absolute basis, which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leaves me in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a bind. Fixing this is definitely on my to-do list, and will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probably occupy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a large portion of my entire life.
</em><br>
<p>I honestly appreciate the sincere response and I appreciate your personal
<br>
dilemma, I too have strong moral principles (obviously), but could not
<br>
accurately and objectively defend each and every one.  I am a fan of Kant,
<br>
Aristotle, Rand among others.  I feel Rand makes compelling arguments for an
<br>
objective basis for ethics, but I admit I am not yet intelligent enough to
<br>
fully defend or even comprehend them.  Recently I have read of Shermers
<br>
efforts to promote a system of 'provisional' ethics, and attempt to draw a
<br>
reasonable, objective and scientific system of moral principles, deriding
<br>
acts which, for example, hurt most of the people most of the time, but I
<br>
admit it is a difficult subject.  However, I am fully cognizant of the need
<br>
to draw a reasonable line, that murder, oppression, enslavement, coercion,
<br>
etc, are wrong.  The fundamental libertarian notion that assaults on person
<br>
or property are always wrong reverberates strongly within me.  However, I
<br>
make the claim that your are a moral relativist based on the fact that it
<br>
seems (to me) that you do not hold all peoples, and all countries to the
<br>
same absolute moral standards.  You seem to judge moral actions differently
<br>
depending on who is the perpetrator of those actions. (cont)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I wish to leave aside the previous discussion, because I think we'll get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nowhere. Hopefully we can agree to disagree (even though that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; means that at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one of us is not a bayesian rationalist :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Oh, and I don't mean to ignore Michael's oft ask question. No, no one has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the right to be a dictator (perhaps excepting if his/her citizens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choose it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but maybe not even then))
</em><br>
<p>That being said, I still can not understand how you can acknowledge that no
<br>
one has any right whatsoever to be a dictator, but blame the deaths
<br>
resulting from the coalitions actions on the coalition, and not the dictator
<br>
whom, as you acknowledge, had no right to be a dictator, and as I have
<br>
noted, only goal was to remain an oppressive murderous dictator.  This is
<br>
what leads me to call you a moral relativist, that you do not stand by your
<br>
moral principle that no one has a right to be a dictator in the case.
<br>
Unless, perhaps, you feel that the coalition had even *less* of a right to
<br>
attempt to remove said dictator than dictator had to stay in power?  An even
<br>
more shocking stance to me if true.
<br>
<p>I would invite you to consider how things might have turned out had Saddam
<br>
instead used this as an oppertunity to better the Arab people, presenting a
<br>
speech that perhaps told the history of the Arab people and Islam, which
<br>
focused on their lead in the world for so many centuries in science,
<br>
culture, and math, while the west was burning witches and building new
<br>
torture devices.  Make it a rallying cry for the Arab people and Islam, to
<br>
show the world the great creative and intellectual power inherient in middle
<br>
eastern peoples that can be unleashed in the first free democratic arab
<br>
nation.  To once again lead the world in science, culture, and art.  But
<br>
that is not what he did, instead he cowered in bunkers and insisted his
<br>
people throw themselves at the coalition forces to certain death, only
<br>
because he wanted to remain a dictator.
<br>
<p>In any case, as you insist, you wish to leave aside this discussion, and if
<br>
you so request I will drop the topic with you and consider and respond to
<br>
your question in an later response.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
