</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Besides which, Egypts got far more serious problems than access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to the Matrix. [long list of problems]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed.  And the US isn't really helping.  We send about $3 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Billion in direct aid each year, but fail to tie it to any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; basic reform of government, reduction in corruption, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement of education, liberalization of the press, or any 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the other measures necessary to fundamentally improve the country.
</em><br>
<p>I think the IMF is just there as an inducement for these countries
<br>
to: 
<br>
a) remain US friendly [regime leaders skim the till]
<br>
b) buy from US manufacturers [kind of like those rip-off &quot;rent-2-own&quot;
<br>
programs]
<br>
<p>The latter being primarily for 2 purposes, the purchase of military
<br>
equipment,
<br>
And of course, the expansion of US intelligence gathering in the form of
<br>
<p>(equivalently subsidized) telephone switching infrastructure with
<br>
monitering
<br>
equipment in place... Ergo eschelon and whatever new thing they've come
<br>
about
<br>
that they would have a difficult time putting in place in the US....
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Current US aid basically just prop up the current corrupt 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regime, delaying any real progress, and increasing the risk 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of an Iranian-style fundamentalist revolution each year.
</em><br>
<p>Mubarek's swiping all of it.  They say you can't close any sort of
<br>
Serious business deal without giving one of his son's a 50% stake in the
<br>
company.  Reminds me of an Egyptian joke [which of course, you can't say
<br>
in public for fear of the secret police]:
<br>
<p>Mubarek announces that he's hired a new Prime Minister of Finance after
<br>
firing the old one for embezzling funds... The new Prime Minister is
<br>
supposed to
<br>
fix all the accounting irregularities plaguing the government books.  So
<br>
he's working
<br>
Late in the office one night, when he overhears Mubarek in the office
<br>
next door saying,
<br>
&quot;Those are for me, This is for Egypt....
<br>
Those are for me, This is for Egypt....
<br>
Those are for me, This is for Egypt.......&quot;
<br>
<p>Intrigued, the new prime minister gets up and peeks inside the office;
<br>
what he see's
<br>
Is Mubarek counting out wads of cash on his desk...  Whenever he says,
<br>
Those are for me,
<br>
he takes a clump of money out of the treasury and puts it inside his
<br>
drawer....  Whenever he says, 
<br>
This is for Egypt, he &lt;&lt;thumps his hand against his bicep while giving
<br>
the middle finger&gt;&gt;.....
<br>
<p>&lt;grin&gt; :)
<br>
<p>That's one of my favorite jokes :)  Its quicker (and funnier) in
<br>
Egyptian; 
<br>
Generally speaking, Egyptians are notorious (amongst mid-easterners) for
<br>
&nbsp;having a fun sense of humor... :P
<br>
<p>omard-out
<br>
