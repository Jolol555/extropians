</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; So, operationally from the outside and from the inside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uploaded copy is the original. I wonder then what the meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of &quot;but the uploaded copy is not REALLY the original&quot; can be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm thinking functional equality is *possibly* not the same as identity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The contrary view appears to me to be that it *necessarily* is.
</em><br>
<p>You are correct.  Functional equality is not *necessarily*
<br>
the same as survival-identity.  In my opinion, a giant lookup
<br>
table made of hyper-computronium would be functionally equivalent,
<br>
but not conscious at all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I feel like me because I remember the things that I remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (including what I don´t consciously remember at this moment)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or, in other words, because of the specific information coded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in my brain. This is I believe the simplest explanation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think this is just a restatement of the &quot;there is no possible difference&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case. I'll grant the duplicated you would feel like they were you.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I won't grant that they *are* you just because they feel like they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are.
</em><br>
<p>Just to clarify my position, I do agree with Giulio here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will grant that to me and everyone relating to you the duplicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be satisfactory.  I am more &quot;selfish&quot; when it comes to me.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely!  This is the *crux* of the real philosophical problem!
<br>
We ought to posit the existence of a Most Selfish Individual, and
<br>
ask to what well-informed decisions he would come.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I don't care whether you and my duplicate and everyone else in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; agrees that after the transformation that produces my duplicate has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce me, I *care* that *I* am not *sure* that it is so beforehand.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, exactly.  True, there are some people whose altruism is so finely
<br>
woven into the rest of their decision making and belief system that it
<br>
cannot be extracted, and they misinterpret the philosophical problem.
<br>
But we are talking about a survival-oriented, selfish view of what is
<br>
&quot;in it&quot; for an individual.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes; in every way your uploaded copy---or even you if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are disintegrated at 10am tomorrow morning and then instantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; re-integrated using the same or different atoms---will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; this same impression.  It could, even now, be happening a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; hundred times a second.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you say &quot;could&quot; what are you basing your view on?
</em><br>
<p>Suppose that there existed a machine that could decompose you into
<br>
your constituent elements within a microsecond.  (That's about 1000
<br>
times slower than sending signals throughout your body.)  Then
<br>
suppose that a few microseconds later, it reconstitutes you.  Now
<br>
suppose that this entire process happens hundreds of times per
<br>
second.  There we are.
<br>
<p>And this is NOT the place to inquire after the actual physical
<br>
plausibility of such a device.  Yes, our notions of who and what we
<br>
are do depend on our basic understandings of physics, but whether
<br>
or not a certain technical breakthrough that is not conceptually
<br>
significant ever occurs or not is moot.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; There are still thinkers thinking thoughts. Of course you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; can accept this as a partial &quot;answer&quot; only i[f] you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that each consciousness is fundamentally the same, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; other words that there is no physical or spiritual &quot;signature&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; other than information that defines the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; you and I.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My thesis contains no &quot;spiritual signature&quot; it contains recursive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; biological programs that require somewhere to store not just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts but thoughts about thoughts, and thoughts about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts about thoughts etc. Possible this requires some sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of recursion counter and a developmental process. Ie. You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't have 'thoughts-about-thoughts' until the wetware has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; developed enough to have 'thoughts' and 'feelings' first and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so on. I think children have thoughts and feelings before they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a sense of self, before they become what we take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be fully sentient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now the question is once an adult level of sentience is achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can you capture the recursion counters in the wetware? A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; snapshot of the conscious process and memories and restore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it either onto an identical wetware substrate or a different set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of firmware on an upload. I don't know.
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  Are you suggesting that it will *never* be possible to
<br>
root out every last property of the human brain?  And what about
<br>
the easy way: a copy is made by a nanotechnological device that
<br>
simply gets all the atoms?  As for uploading, we will have to
<br>
wait to see what level of sophistication is truly required.  It
<br>
may be that stripping off one neuron at a time, noting its
<br>
connections, and making sure that the machine implements an
<br>
equivalent architecture is sufficient.  In *this* particular
<br>
case, I do believe that functional equivalence is adequate to
<br>
guarantee that the consciousness, intelligence, etc., is the
<br>
same---i.e., it feels that its you just the way you do, it is
<br>
a difference without a difference, etc.  That's because it
<br>
makes the same computations you do (which isn't true in the
<br>
giant lookup table because IMO computations do not occur).
