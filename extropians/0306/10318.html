<br>
<em>&gt; Let me suggest the main problem is that people don't realize that there
</em><br>
really
<br>
<em>&gt; are such things as social sciences, which can be just as &quot;scientific&quot; as
</em><br>
other
<br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sciences&quot;, but are far less deferred to.  The public can read that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physicist says some weird thing or another and the usual reaction is &quot;how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fascinating, I didn't know that&quot;, even if they have little idea what it
</em><br>
means,
<br>
<em>&gt; but if a social scientist says some well established thing that goes
</em><br>
against
<br>
<em>&gt; popular wishes, such as that a minimum wage raises unemployment, the
</em><br>
reaction
<br>
<em>&gt; will be a quick dismissal.  Alas, one of the myths of democracy is that
</em><br>
there
<br>
<em>&gt; should be no social experts, so that every thought that occurs to anyone
</em><br>
on
<br>
<em>&gt; social issues is as valid as anything any &quot;expert&quot; says.  It's just not
</em><br>
so.
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about this characterization of democracy versus the social
<br>
science. I think there are plausible historical studies (e.g., Weber or
<br>
Macintyre (most notably in _After Virtue__) that describe the rise of the
<br>
social sciences and the social expert. Their narratives describe the rise of
<br>
such experts in terms of their ability to tell us the most efficient way to
<br>
achieve some social end. The ends themselves are not open to scientific
<br>
scrutiny, since ends involve values, and values lack &quot;factual content&quot; they
<br>
are grounded merely in the assertion of our wills. They hey day of this
<br>
conception was in the earlier part of the twentieth century. I'll grant you
<br>
that this conception has come under attack by what--for a lack of a better
<br>
term--are certain postmodern conceptions of the social science. One PM claim
<br>
is that the idea of social scientists being able to tell us in some purely
<br>
scientific way the most efficient means to achieve some value is an
<br>
illusion, that the idea of social experts managing the &quot;means&quot; aspect of
<br>
social organization is an illusion ( a mask to hide their wills). This view
<br>
then might agree with your claim that the social scientist is not to be
<br>
listened to when they say something like a minimum wage increases
<br>
unemployment. Those that hold that social scientist can only inform us about
<br>
means or&quot;facts&quot; might say that perhaps it is true that a minimum wage
<br>
increases unemployment but this does not show whether the fact that a
<br>
minimum wage increases unemployment is a good or a bad thing. (Perhaps the
<br>
view is that some forms of employment are less valuable than unemployment).
<br>
This view of social science as a manager of &quot;means&quot; only has also come under
<br>
attack from the other more traditional quarter (cf. MacIntyre) which says
<br>
that there are social experts but their expertise covers both means and
<br>
ends, facts and values. (MacIntyre defends this idea by claiming in part
<br>
that all moral theory presupposes some social theory, and all social theory
<br>
presupposes some moral view).
