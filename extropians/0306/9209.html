Robert, my spidey sense is telling me you're perhaps 35% serious about this,
<br>
so why not lower our sights a little to a project not quite so &quot;ambitious&quot;?
<br>
<p>Imagine instead a large  underground monolithic dome connected to a series
<br>
of radially spaced tunnels leading to smaller, private domes. The smaller
<br>
domes would function as the sleeping/reading/web surfing quarters for a
<br>
single extropian family/single/couple while the larger dome would
<br>
essentially function as a *gulp* &quot;techno-commune&quot; where we shared such
<br>
material things as a grand kitchen, a library, laundry facilities, a
<br>
fireplace, and even an opening skylight with a telescope or WHY.
<br>
<p>We could build much of it with our own little extropian hands, and cobble
<br>
together a &quot;constitution&quot; from the e-publications of other experimental
<br>
community living projects. A constitution would set out a few rules
<br>
regarding issues like who does the dishes and when, and how to avoid eating
<br>
up each other's captain crunch cereal etc..
<br>
<p>I believe as extropians we are bound to draw closer together over the course
<br>
of the next few decades (or centuries) and we ought to seriously consider
<br>
clever, economical, and downright cool strategies that might enhance our
<br>
understanding and appreciation of these final, historic, pre-singularity
<br>
days.
<br>
<p>If we could pull something like this together it would be a superb
<br>
achievement.
