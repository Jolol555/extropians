Eliezer said:
<br>
<p>&quot;It is *ridiculous* to suppose that *anyone* on the Extropians mailing list,
<br>
regardless of their other politics, supports Hussein.  The prior probability
<br>
is so low that making such a comment is either an ad hominem debating tactic,
<br>
or human tribal thinking resulting in the sheer STUPIDITY and WARPING of
<br>
intellect necessary to distort one's probabilities THAT FAR away from the
<br>
simple COMMON SENSE that NOBODY on the Extropians mailing list is likely
<br>
to support Hussein!  What is going on here cannot possibly be Bayesian
<br>
reasoning.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would normally be the first to agree with you Eliezer, it would be extremely
<br>
odd and unlikely to suspect someone on the extropian list would support a
<br>
regime like that of Hussiens.  However, I should note in this thread,
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=56165;st">http://www.extropy.org/bbs/index.php?board=67;action=display;threadid=56165;st</a>
<br>
art=15 (perhaps ironically included in the title is 'Twisted ethics prevelant
<br>
on extropy board')
<br>
<p>Extropian Jeff Davis said of Vietnam (points I plan to debate with him in the
<br>
near future):
<br>
<p>&quot;[there is] No &quot;enslavement&quot; by the communists, just a different form of
<br>
government facing the difficult task of rebuilding a country savaged by
<br>
124 years of foreign dictatorships, and made all the more difficult by the
<br>
opposition of the political elite of the world's richest and most powerful
<br>
country.  An elite filled with hostility by their defeat at the hands of a
<br>
people with the brains, discipline, and courage to pay the enormous price
<br>
required to &quot;refuse&quot; the tyranny of foreign dictators&quot;
<br>
<p>And
<br>
<p>&quot;All governments have laws for the maintenance of social order.  Freedom of
<br>
speech has its limitations.  I may not cry &quot;fire!&quot; in a crowded theater, nor
<br>
advocate the violent overthrow of the US government.  Communists (and their
<br>
subsequent governments), under siege by the capitalists from before the ink
<br>
was dry on the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, feel the need to protect themselves from foreign
<br>
subversion&quot;
<br>
<p>It seems Jeff is essentially shifting the blame of communist attrocities to
<br>
the capitalists.  Anyway, for the relation to Iraq, I will further note that
<br>
Freedom house, a non-profit non-partison organization
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.freedomhouse.org/research/mrr2003.pdf">http://www.freedomhouse.org/research/mrr2003.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>Gave Iraq its lowest political Rights rating, that of 7, its lowest Civil
<br>
Liberties rating, also 7, and a general status of 'Not Free'
<br>
<p>Similiarly, Freedom house gave Vietnam a rating of 7,6, and Not free as well.
<br>
I should note that Freedomhouse has been ranking countries since the mid 60's,
<br>
and only recently did Vietnam escalate from the lowest possible rating of
<br>
7,7,NF to 7,6,NF, and Freedom House still considers Vietnam to be one of the
<br>
10 Worst regimes in the world.
<br>
<p>Freedomhouse's web site describes the ratings systems.
<br>
<p>No doubt other freedom ratings systems will return similiar results.  Freedom
<br>
House essentially ranks Vietnam as terrible of a regime as Iraq, yet Jeff
<br>
clearly feels Vietnam is a legitimate govt.
<br>
<p>Given that, it is not a stretch of imagination to feel that other members of
<br>
this list might for some reason feel Hussien's Iraq regime was legitimate.
<br>
Recently Humania insisted that 'Americas brutal form of capitalism should
<br>
be stopped' (paraphrasing, he has yet to elaborate on this statement) and
<br>
a few months ago I and others participated in a debate with an individual
<br>
who was clearly an anarcho-socialist.  I can only fathom what intellectual
<br>
history these individuals underwent to come to these conclusions and still be
<br>
extropians, but there is no doubt that one can never be absolutely sure there
<br>
are no communist extropians, no dictator favoring extropians, and even no
<br>
luddite extropians (hey, who knows what people will internally justify)
<br>
<p>I would suggest then not to be so quick to assume what idealogical
<br>
similiarities calling oneself an 'extropian' might bring.  There is no doubt
<br>
reading Jeff other posts that he shares all the qualities we would consider
<br>
extropian, embracing technological advancement, prolonging human life,
<br>
encouraging the development of AI, etc. etc.  However, a deep idealogical
<br>
rift is present among him and other members of this list, such as myself, and
<br>
no doubt many other intellectual chasms exist which both sides will find it
<br>
difficult to understand, though I am all for trying.
<br>
<p>Regards
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
