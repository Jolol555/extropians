Harvey Newstrom stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Thanks!  But it's not just me.  Amara, Damiaen, Eliezer, Emlyn, Hubert,
<br>
James, Jeff, Mez, Olga, Samantha and I have all been recently accused of
<br>
somehow supporting the enemy.  These baseless personal attacks seem to be a
<br>
widespread problem. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I would say that frequently, (not always!) much of our ideological 
<br>
differences are based on what we state here on the list, and the manner of how we state 
<br>
our beliefs, suspicions, reasoning, and observations. Some differences will 
<br>
never, ever, be bridged,  nor should they.  However, since many of us who post 
<br>
on this list will never personally interact with their fellow Extropes, these 
<br>
writings are all we have to go by. It may be shallow, but it seems that is how 
<br>
human nature appears to work.
<br>
<p>I am sure the impressions of myself are that of a bull-necked fascist, 
<br>
nationalist; and I may completely deserve such an approbation. As I see myself, I 
<br>
view a pragmatist with standards; a skeptic who is frequently skeptical of many 
<br>
of the futurist promises many of the professional futurists and forecasters 
<br>
have come up. I used to hang on the writings of Marvin Cetron and Herman Kahn, 
<br>
but have found them to be too inaccurate.
<br>
<p>My impressions, based ONLY on the writings and responses are quick and unfair 
<br>
&lt;==
<br>
But here they are as follows (Innacurate as they may be!)
<br>
<p>Amara: Brilliant Astrophysicist, decidely holding a mentality from a kinder 
<br>
time. Means what she says to the point of leaving the USA.
<br>
<p>Damien: Ascerbic wit. Keen-minded futurist and wirter (should be getting the 
<br>
airplay that Bruce Sterling has, and for more reasons) but strikes me as the 
<br>
type of guy who trusts Americans, about as much as a a rattlesnake trusts a 
<br>
mongoose.
<br>
<p>Emlyn: a Co-lander of Damien. Cool guy. Flexible in opinions, pragmatic. 
<br>
<p>Hubert: Totally pissed off at Americans for reasons that seem to go beyond 
<br>
foreign policy.
<br>
<p>James: not sure.
<br>
<p>Jeff Davis: I haven't read to much, but has spiked (not Spiked) a couple of 
<br>
times on my 
<br>
Jew-O-Meter. Could be completely wrong on this (and so much else) by hmmmm.
<br>
<p>Mez: Newbie, Middle Easterner. I am not going balastic, not because I don't 
<br>
disagree; but because I suspect that the man has history with the violence over 
<br>
there, and thus when the dendrites burn (especially one's own) one can take a 
<br>
dim view of things.
<br>
<p>Olga: Why do I think Greenie type? Its easy to pidgeon-hole people. Wrong, 
<br>
but I do it.
<br>
<p>Samantha: Defiantly, anti-Establishment. Like Brando said in the Wild Ones 
<br>
(1954) &quot;What are you rebelling against? (Brando) What do ya got?&quot;
<br>
<p>Like I said, these are impressions, unfair, and based merely on these posts, 
<br>
but that's the
<br>
impression I get. It may have Nothing to due with the truth. Just my way of 
<br>
sorting.
<br>
<p>Last, is E. Yudkowsky. Brilliant, but antagonistic.  Self-driven (who isn't) 
<br>
but does not play well with the other kiddies on the playground. Or might say 
<br>
he too, has his standards. 
<br>
<p>Well, that's it folks. Definitely not attempting to anger or butter-up. Just 
<br>
impressions.
<br>
<p>My next impression will be the Aflack Duck. Quack
<br>
<p>-Mitch
