<p>Both. That is what I meant by &quot;commercial
<br>
&nbsp;venture/lifestyle opportunity.&quot;  
<br>
<p>It would seem that media coverage of Big Business, American Style has
<br>
obliterated memories of how most businesses here used to be built, and
<br>
how they often still are in the 3rd world.  How about just a bunch of
<br>
working stiffs scraping up 20K buy-in expenses + 4K first run
<br>
operational expenses and buying into a ship that can carry cargo
<br>
across the ocean?
<br>
<p>Yes, these people would live aboard the ship, many of them. Maybe they
<br>
cannot afford another home.  Oh, the shame of it! I have intimiated
<br>
that people may exist who are actually--gasp--unrich!
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;If the latter,
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Profits would be less, but why would that shut them out of business?
<br>
They would have no payroll to meet.....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But the former might be a
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;carrier of sorts, just that most of its child craft
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I doubt that an aircraft carrier with 500 men aboard would be at much
<br>
danger from pirates.
