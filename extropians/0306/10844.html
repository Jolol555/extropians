</em><br>
<em>&gt;Right. I'm for motherhood and apple pie too.
</em><br>
<p>What about orange juice? :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt;What i think is that, without proper  information, people often make

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Without relevant information people could make the wrong choice, I think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;GM information is more relevant than the astrological sign of the farmer who

</em><br>
<p>OK, so we are down again to the information and education problem. Words
<br>
like &quot;frankenfood&quot; reflect a basic misunderstanding of GM, protests
<br>
against GM are usually groundless, but the feeling of not knowing what we
<br>
eat is an entirely legitimate concern IMHO.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt; it just feels wasteful to go to such great lengths just to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt; see if that red fluid in a bottle is orange juice or colored water.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;But what reason is there to think that laws and the bloated government
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;selling colored water as orange juice better than the market can?
</em><br>
<p>I am somewhat uneasy at applying market logic to issues regarding basic
<br>
human needs. Even assuming that the market will adjust perfectly, it will
<br>
do at the public expense (at first): for example, if a producer sells some
<br>
poisoned food, the market will not correct it before some people die. Or,
<br>
if very unsafe cars are sold, again they will continue to be sold until
<br>
they are demonstrated unsafe on the market, e.g. when people die because
<br>
of them (come to think of it, the FDA is doing a better job than
<br>
automobile regulations...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt;If the free  market of ideas brings billions of $ to football
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;players and nothing to cryonics research, well, that's just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;free market at work. Judging from what I read in your post,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;you should approve those choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;It's not perfect, is that a surprise?
</em><br>
<p>Of course not, but it seems that many people think it is....
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I've said this before and people
</em><br>
<em>&gt;think I'm joking but I am not; the free market is only the second
</em><br>
<em>&gt;best system, without a doubt the best way to organize society is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;just to have everybody do exactly what John K Clark tells them to do.
</em><br>
<p>No,no, the best one is to do what Alfio Puglisi says. You know, it's just
<br>
for the benefit of myse.. of the people. On things I am uninterested with,
<br>
I can let John say something. And where we are both uninterested, that
<br>
free market thing can exercise its rights.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Unfortunately for some reason I've had a bit of difficulty convincing
</em><br>
<em>&gt;others of the wisdom of this approach so I have to settle for second best.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why it's so difficult :-) Many political leaders were able to
<br>
do that.
<br>
<p>Ciao,
<br>
Alfio
