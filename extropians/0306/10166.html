<br>
<p><p>Shade opined:
<br>
&lt;&lt;First, thats one fundamentalist party leader (of which there
<br>
are many); Second, that are moderate &quot;fundamentalist&quot; party
<br>
leaders that don't agree with him and declared his jihad to
<br>
be wrong... Ergo my point that equating fundamentalism and an
<br>
American body count is not a valid 1-to-1 mapping...&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>1) Islam, by its nature is a fundamentalist religion. The closest thing
<br>
to progressive Islam, are the Sufi's who practice a kind of ecstatic
<br>
&quot;Pentacostalist&quot; dancing rituals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; hardly.  most practicing muslims are sunni; and sunni's are permitted
</em><br>
(encouraged and required) to read 
<br>
and interpret the koran to the best of their abilities.  And while
<br>
fatwah's are binding in the sense that they
<br>
represent the current consensus in regards to the correct interpretation
<br>
of a surrah or hadith, there are in fact
<br>
several schools of interpretation... each muslim has his or her own
<br>
preference for which school of thought most
<br>
closely parallels his or her particular interpretation of the
<br>
religion...  And if that isn't progressive, than Christianity
<br>
and Judiasm are as much a fundamentalist religion as Islam is, and thus,
<br>
fundamentalism as you choose to define it
<br>
is pretty much irrelevant.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
2) Before this administration came to power, the Islamists, who seem to
<br>
be in charge of things in Islam nowadays; have advocated attacks against
<br>
the United States. In fact, the war against the US is a war against US
<br>
ideas, and culture, because the Islamists view it as undermining the
<br>
faith of their people by corruption.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Or it could be because the movement towards secularism (which is
</em><br>
endorsed by many a US-mideast puppet regime), has resulted in large
<br>
quantities of poor, uneducated people.
<br>
Remember, an informal condition for muslim-predominant states to be
<br>
friends of the US is that they suppress religious-based political
<br>
parties; that in and of itself
<br>
is a problem, since a particularly well-informed westerner pointed out,
<br>
that the koran is not only a faith, but a code of laws (Shuria).  The US
<br>
is in effect, denying
<br>
muslim states the ability to follow their faith.  This conflict between
<br>
the western ideal of separation of church and state as holy, and that of
<br>
predominantly muslim states
<br>
wanting to enact an Islamic government is one that must be addressed,
<br>
preferably by the US butting out, or even more simply, following the
<br>
spirit of a democracy.
<br>
<p>The current example is the violence between Iranian students and the
<br>
vigilante's now attempting to break up demonstrations in Tehran, unto
<br>
this very hour. You can also view, if you care to, OSB's declaration of
<br>
war against &quot;Crusaders and Jews&quot; that was published on the web, in 1998.
<br>
Before that was the attacks on westerners by the Muslim Brotherhood in
<br>
Egypt, starting in the early 1960's, as a means of purifying the 
<br>
perceived corruption of the Gamal Abdul Nasser regime, with its cozy
<br>
relationship with the Soviets, and Europeans. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Well, as an Egyptian, I can tell you that the system is very much
</em><br>
corrupt, even unto this day. 
<br>
And although I have left the faith a long time ago, I would very willing
<br>
support an islam-based
<br>
&nbsp;state.  The code of laws is *that* fair, and certes, an improvement
<br>
over the current situation.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
You may heave brickbats at America (those politicians sure do love dat
<br>
old debbil oil, and love to be advisors to the Wahabbi kingdom), but the
<br>
chief responsibility of how Muslims behave, lies within themselves.
<br>
Making the US jump through hoops to placate the Islamic (read Islamist)
<br>
world appears merely encourage more violent and intolerant behavior from
<br>
Islam. Remember the quote from Osama regarding how people like the
<br>
stronger horse?  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;In short, leave the middle east.  Stop meddling in their affairs.  In
</em><br>
fact, I would suggest something as radical as wacking the CIA's budget
<br>
:)
<br>
That should keep you out of trouble :)  Probably help out a lot of
<br>
non-muslim/mid-east countries too...
<br>
<p>To get back to the Thread Topic, I am not sure everything should be
<br>
defined as Extropian or not. Was the Great Revolution of 1688 in
<br>
Britain, Extropian? How about the 1832 creation of the Third Republic in
<br>
France? Its not like apples and oranges, its like apples and LVAD's.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Sorry for the divergence, I felt that there were alot of points that
</em><br>
needed to be addressed (or rather, challenged).
<br>
<p>Finally, if no nerve gas or biotoxins can be found in Iraq, or found
<br>
that they have been sent to Syria (for example) then we have been
<br>
subjected to a Wag The Dog lie from Bush. I suspect that Bush is hiding
<br>
the fact that Syria took the stuff in question, as a means to cajole the
<br>
Syrians into joining the team. I could be wrong, but its just a hunch.
<br>
In this case, a lie is still a lie, even if its for a &quot;good&quot; reason. If
<br>
these allegations are proven true, Bush should no longer be given carte
<br>
blanche on foreign policy. Because if they lied, then every claim now
<br>
needs to be scrutinized, because if he's going to lie once, he's going
<br>
to lie again.   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;Personally, I think he should be impeached and tried before a war
</em><br>
crimes tribunal, 
<br>
preferably staffed by countries he's &quot;helped&quot; under his current foreign
<br>
policy..
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
omard-out 
<br>

<br>
<p>PS&gt; I'm sorry I won't be able to respond if you feel a further need to
<br>
respond; 
<br>
I will be traveling shortly, and my internet connectivity (or rather,
<br>
ability to respond) 
<br>
will be very much non-existent.  If you would like, I would be happy to
<br>
continue to answer 
<br>
any questions you may have offlist, but the
<br>
answers/responses/conversation  will be at 
<br>
least a month in coming.  Obviously feel free to discuss amongst
<br>
yourselves :)
