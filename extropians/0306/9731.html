Yeah, they *never* lied, nor did they have two prominent members revealed to

be stooges of Saddam in a recent London newspaper expose.

<p>And I am trying to find a new languate to communicate my extreme disgust at
<br>
the way some incurable america haters still stick to the US is the root of
<br>
all evil propogandadists bent on world communist domination called france,
<br>
germany, and the peace activists.  How many more times must you be fucked up
<br>
by these dilapidated religious fundamentalists before you chase them into
<br>
the desert?  Note, preceding statements contain sarcasm.  Humania, yet again
<br>
I am trying to illustrate that your spewing emotional blather about the US
<br>
and its actions do *absolutely nothing* to change the 'incurable patriots'
<br>
(as you call them) minds about the US and its actions.  Since you call them
<br>
'incurable' what is the point of your comments, if your merely preaching to
<br>
the choir, I cant see the value of your posts.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I always thought this list was originally dedicated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the enhancement of man
</em><br>
<p>It is, it is also painfully obvious that your idea of what actions will
<br>
enhance man are different then mine and others on this list, indeed, there
<br>
are probably as many ideas about how to enhance man (mankind, civilization,
<br>
etc) as their are people on this list.  What makes your version of it
<br>
deserve more praise?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and not to the sick propaganda of spreading
</em><br>
<em>&gt; potentially apocalyptic violence and mega-effective death all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over the world
</em><br>
<p>Prove that the actions we support are accurately described by your
<br>
charactherizations.  I have called you to task on your statements time and
<br>
time again, presented a bulleted list of points that those who supported the
<br>
War in Iraq felt justified in supporting it why supporting it was extropic,
<br>
and asked anyone to refute *any* of the points.  I saw no refutations.  You
<br>
have not bothered.  Its seems your tactic is to just spew emotional vomit ad
<br>
nauseam until we start listening to you, it aint working.  Please make a
<br>
modicum of an effort to convince us empirically of your interpretation of
<br>
actions occuring in the world, or keep quiet, imho.  If the evidence
<br>
supports your conclusions that the US's actions will lead to the end of the
<br>
world, you shouldnt have much difficulty convincing a good number of members
<br>
on this list of that, I have, as of yet, seen you make no effort to present
<br>
evidence supporting you implication that the US's actions will lead to
<br>
'apocalyptic violence' although you did add a 'potentially' qualifier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and - worst of all - even being PROUD of it and still having the nerve to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; call oneself a transhumanist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And you are proud of opposing the military ousting of one of the most
<br>
murderous and corrupt regimes in the world, simply because, as you have
<br>
previously stated, you dont want the US to be given sanction on other
<br>
possible future actions.  Because you feared what the US might do in the
<br>
future, you opposed a historically unprecendented military endeveour with
<br>
fewer civilian causalities than any war in history, which freed 20 million
<br>
people from the chains of a ruthless tyrant.  And YOU call YOURSELF a
<br>
transhumanist, name one Iraq policy that supported any extropian memes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In the spirit of peace, love and the enhancement of man:
</em><br>
<p>Oddly enough, I claim to be acting in that spirit as well, whos right?  How
<br>
can we tell?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Turn your back on the brutality of the American interpretation of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; capitalism!
</em><br>
<p>And what interpretation of capitalism do you suggest we embrace?  The
<br>
canadian 'interpretation'?  The German?  And what does America's
<br>
interpretation of capitalism have to do with the morallity of the Invasion
<br>
in Iraq anyway?  This is more like a &quot;speaking of things I dont like about
<br>
America, lets bring up its 'interpretation of capitalism' &quot; puuhleeease.
<br>
What else dont you like about America, I have nothing better to do than
<br>
listen to your anti-america rants.
<br>
<p>Please make a modicum of effort to prove empirically, yet again, that
<br>
Americas interpretation of capitalism is 'brutal'  America has the highest
<br>
per capita and median income in the world, Americas interpretation of
<br>
capitalism drove to bankruptucy the most ruthless and murderous regime the
<br>
world has ever known, communism.  America is the leading food producer of
<br>
the world, and is capable of this solely because of its 'ruthless
<br>
capitalism' enables it to produce food cheaper than anywhere else in the
<br>
world, and subesequently the worlds poorest of the poor recieve more
<br>
calories today then they did 50 years ago, and the percentage of people
<br>
starving to death in the world is lower than it has ever been.  Then only
<br>
thing preventing a continual decline in the number of people starving to
<br>
death is the idiotic embrace of 3rd world murderous tyrants by well meaning
<br>
but ignorant who value criticizing the US over the lives of people in 3rd
<br>
world countries.
<br>
<p>Try not to be part of the establishment, because it
<br>
<em>&gt; might twist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your mind in the wrong direction
</em><br>
<p>And of course the *right* direction happens to also be your direction.  As
<br>
the church lady would say 'well.. isnt that convenient'
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and deprive you of your compassion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; towards the poor and the weak, and towards those who are not natural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; born collegeboys.
</em><br>
<p>You may have all the compassion in the world, but the policies and ideals
<br>
you embrace hurt the poor people of the world.  As I noted above, the
<br>
'brutal' American interpretation of capitalism has done more for the poor in
<br>
the world (and in the US) than any countries economic system EVER HAS.  I
<br>
note the US saved the ENTIRE world TWICE this century.  It could not have
<br>
done this under differening economic systems.  Communism, which actually
<br>
claims as an idealogical goal to be better for the poor, has killed 170
<br>
million people *this century*  It is likely that America's 'brutal'
<br>
capitalism has probably saved that many.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Wake up! There is no such thing as security. It may hit you any time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and any place.
</em><br>
<p>On this point, I am probably in agreement with you, I think much of the
<br>
spending to ensure the security of American citizens is a waste.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Take a look for innovative ways to trick the neural patches where the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; antagonists of the human ability to love and be *actively* peaceful rule:
</em><br>
<p>Love and peace do not conquer all, Love did not conquer the Communist Khmere
<br>
Rouge, the love of a mother to her child did not prevent its head from
<br>
getting smashed against trees under the rule of the 'for the poor people'
<br>
communists in Cambodia.  Guns and weapons and American troops would have
<br>
prevented it, unfortunately the US liberal majority decided to let the
<br>
people of indochina rot and suffer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; America must not win all the time!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Americas enemies must NOT win all the time!  Boy, what a productive
<br>
conversation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Relax and Fear Not: The Bush and NeoCon nightmare will hopefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be history by 2004.
</em><br>
<p>Relax and fear not, the neo con effort to spread democracy, freedom, and
<br>
capitalism throughout the world will continue on in 2004.  Oppressive
<br>
dictatorial and communist regimes beware. Despite a lot of whinning by
<br>
social anrachist luddite communists.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a new kind of transhumanism of social fairness where the poor and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; losers get a fair chance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>And what system would you suggest where they get a 'fair' chance.  Please,
<br>
also, define 'fair' and 'chance'.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
