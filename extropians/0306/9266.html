<p>
Many people have contacted me offline because of recent comments I have been
<br>
making.  I have a long history of being frustrated with the Extropians
<br>
movement and particularly this list.  I drop out, I drop in, and I argue a
<br>
lot.  I was among the first subscribers to this list at the end of the '80s
<br>
decade.  Now, I have just turned 40, and I am not sure that we are
<br>
accomplishing anything.
<br>
<p>Instead of arguing over historical activities or pushing the burden of proof
<br>
back and forth, I have decided to start a new discussion to try to address
<br>
my fears.
<br>
<p>My biggest concern right now is that, in general, most Extropians lack the
<br>
scientific expertise or understanding to support the evaluations and
<br>
predictions we make.  I fear that we are more like salespeople and
<br>
advertisers who make unfounded claims for their product with no support.  We
<br>
are almost like a cult that selectively quotes scientific articles to
<br>
support our pre-conceived ideas.  Without going into examples, I am
<br>
constantly seeing people quoting scientific studies and totally
<br>
misrepresenting what the study says.  More often than not, people on this
<br>
list dispute the study's final outcome and then reinterprets the data the
<br>
way we want, and claim that the study supports our viewpoint.
<br>
<p>How do we know if we know what we are doing?  One idea I had was to find out
<br>
how many experts we had in each technology area.  This idea was quickly shot
<br>
down with people disputing &quot;experts&quot; and arguing that non-experts are
<br>
important too.  While this is very true, it didn't help my suspicions that
<br>
we are mostly outsiders merely guessing at this stuff.  If we aren't
<br>
experts, (or maybe even anti-expert!) then on what basis do we claim any
<br>
knowledge or support for our ideas that are outside the mainstream?
