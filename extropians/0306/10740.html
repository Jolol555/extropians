Brett Paatsch stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I heard Australian PM Howard talking
<br>
about possibly being a buyer of nuclear defence shielding 
<br>
systems. This seems completely nuts to me. The chances of 
<br>
being attacked by ICBMs etc seem virtually zero in comparison
<br>
with say a suitcase nuke or dirty bomb or something similar. 
<br>
ICBMs leave a trail that's like a return to sender with interest
<br>
message. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>1. Smuggled weapons appear less likely, since the creation of several NEST 
<br>
teams in various countries. NEST = nuclear emergency search teams, Since 9-11 
<br>
there have been many passive monitors that wait for a nuclear weapons profile to 
<br>
enter ports and critical cities like DC. A suitcase bomb would likely be 
<br>
under 500 ton (not kilo or megaton).  A small nuke detonating in a harbor would be 
<br>
unlikely to have the same kill ratio as an explosion in Los Angeles or 
<br>
Houston. Thus, considerably less psychological intimidation.
<br>
<p>2. An ICBM is just nifty if you wish to slay hundreds of thousands in just 45 
<br>
minutes. Very short evacuation time, there would be a very useless trip-wire 
<br>
for evacuation. You have a better chance of impacting your enemy with 
<br>
&quot;unaccpetable damages&quot; that way. You could also MIRV your warhead to deliver triple 
<br>
damage (3 warheads) onto or near a target city, base, hostage zone.
<br>
<p>3. All the big kids have done it. The US, the CCCP and its successor, the PRC 
<br>
and so forth. If smiggling small nukes into cities was so effacious, it would 
<br>
have been tried before. I am guessing some dry attempts have been practiced 
<br>
in the last 55 years; and have been found wanting.
