<em>&gt; Harvey said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It is true that the exact phrase &quot;war crimes&quot; was not used in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the incidents I complained about.  Try looking for people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; being accused of supporting communism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AND
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Wrong.  When someone is accused of being supporting communism,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; terrorism, or the enemy without any evidence,that is slander.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AND
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I disagree.  There is no tiny kernel of truth.  None of these people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have ever given any indication of supporting the enemy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I find this particular example interesting.  Harvey, what if someone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accuses somebody of one of these and has evidence to support that, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a 'tiny kernel', what then?
</em><br>
<p>If there is real evidence, then the attack is not slander.  Because the
<br>
defense against slander is that the statements are true.  But it is still ad
<br>
hominem.  The debate is aimed at the individual person instead of the topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, Harvey, since you have made a good presence at suggesting what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could be considered to be good conclusion to reasonable draw from others
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments, I wonder how you interpret Jeff's statements?
</em><br>
<p>I have no interest choosing sides in this political battle at the same time
<br>
I am trying to enforce list rules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; revelation on Jeff's part sparked no comments, then perhaps I inferred
</em><br>
<em>&gt; completely incorrectly and every other extropian out there is thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 'That's not what Jeff was saying, idiot!'  Or, alternatively, perhaps no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one founds Jeff's comments startling at all, even though they found my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interpretation correct (or not).  Or, third, perhaps no one saw the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post, as I am no doubt the member of many kill files.
</em><br>
<p>Or, fourth, the whole point of focusing on Jeff is off-topic and
<br>
uninteresting to most readers.  Maybe people want to read about perpetual
<br>
progress, self-transformation, practical optimism, intelligent technology,
<br>
open society, self-direction or rational thinking, and don't care whether
<br>
you can prove anything specific about this particular list member or not.
<br>
<p>Even if you do prove something?  So what?  Let's say we hold a star-chamber
<br>
online and find Jeff guilty in absentia.  You present your evidence and we
<br>
all vote 100% unanimously that we find Jeff guilty of harboring supportive
<br>
thoughts about Saddam Hussein and/or communism.  So what do we do next?
<br>
Move the trial into the sentencing phase?  What exactly is the end-game to
<br>
this process you are pursuing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Harvey later noted:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Do you realize that this is ad hominem?  You are no longer discussing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the merits of the paper.  You are discussing the merits of the person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who wrote it.  You are no longer questioning the points he made.  You
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are now questioning the person who made those points.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I must say I find this to be a valid point.  Focus on the arguments, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the arguer.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks.  And to be clear, this is my only point.  People have repeatedly
<br>
argued that a lack of condemnation in specific cases implies biased support.
<br>
I must again insist that a lack of statement implies nothing.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, in attempting to do this, If I should point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that (for example) Jeff's arguments are in support of communism, am I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not directly implying that he is also, since he is the one making those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments?  Thusly, I could be accused of an ad hominem, even though I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am attacking the argument, and not the arguer.
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  Even in your own question, you attribute the implications
<br>
correctly &quot;since he is the one making those arguments&quot;.  No one should
<br>
accuse you of ad hominem if you attack the argument and not the arguer.
<br>
That is the definition of avoiding ad hominem.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Harvey, I would be interested in seeing some examples if you have them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; readily available, especially if you feel I am guilty of any of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behavior you mention as I was recently informed that there have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complaints about my posts.  Though no specifics were provided, I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; always up for self-improvement.
</em><br>
<p>I cannot imagine that this will do any good, and will only lead us into
<br>
further debate over minutia.  But since it is only fair, I will send you
<br>
some examples off-line.  However, please realize that these few examples of
<br>
people being accused of having enemy ties are just a very small part of the
<br>
larger ad hominem problem which violates list rules.  Also note that the
<br>
specific examples of the past are not as important as how we are going to
<br>
deal with them in the future.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ron, Lee, Myself, MaxPlumm, John Clark, and people who profess
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ideologies similar to our group have received such wonderful
</em><br>
<em>&gt; descriptions as those above, and had similar amazing statements such as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Foaming tribalist fanatics&quot; &quot;To the extent that patriotism switches on,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the brain switches off.  To the extent that the brain stays on, it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; because patriotism is being kept on a leash&quot;, &quot;Patriotism skews people's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to analyze which side, if any, is in the right.&quot; &quot;tired war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drivel&quot; etc. etc.
</em><br>
<p>Seriously, I can't find any of these examples directed by name against an
<br>
individual.  I seem to find these occurrences, but they are generic
<br>
discussions about topics not people.  For example, Eliezer's discussion
<br>
about patriotism contains those specific phrases.  He did not call any
<br>
person any names, mention any specific list members, nor could they seem to
<br>
be applied to the person he was debating at the time (Lee Corbin).  These
<br>
references seem to be part of a rational discussion about the topic without
<br>
accusing each other or anybody else.  I can only speculate why you assumed
<br>
that these descriptions applied to the particular people you mention.  I
<br>
think you are having difficulty distinguishing between an attack on the
<br>
argument and an attack on the person.  Eliezer and others do not seem guilty
<br>
of the ad hominem, nor do I find any searching for the phrases you
<br>
suggested.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I note that as good as you have been a pointing out dishonest debating I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't recall you ever criticizing statements like the ones above
</em><br>
<em>&gt; directed toward people who have a generally different ideology.  I also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never once saw you criticize Humania for making such comments to me as
</em><br>
<p>I am not perfect.  I simply don't have time nor the omniscience to catch
<br>
every possible case that should receive my comment.  I am also not the
<br>
current moderator.  I do not read every thread to catch every transgression,
<br>
nor could I attempt to do so within my eight-posts-per-day limit.  Again, a
<br>
lack of comment from me does not indicate support of anything.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;You (plural; the patriots here) twist around the words of your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opponents&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;you (plural) were fucked up by your humble servants called Bush
</em><br>
<em>&gt; administration&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;could it be that your  Pentagon and-White-House-dominated thinking in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; union with adrenalin-aided visualizations of smashing those Middle
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eastern bastards which amplifies the already existing territorial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullshit in your brain&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;vicious circle of astonishingly flexible ancient lizard brain circuits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that spread the message towards the cortex to merely defend&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If in June 2003 you are still on the same level as your fellow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; republican US politicians while dealing with ultra conservative monkey
</em><br>
<em>&gt; business like territorial pissings with funnily talking Arabs who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stubbornly deny wearing blue jeans and display this strange effeminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; outfit while unexpectedly rejecting the American way of life altogether&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Meanwhile I am trying to find a new language to communicate my extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disgust at the way some incurable patriots here still stick to His
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Phoniness George &quot;Proud 'n' Pray&quot; W. Bush and his gang of deathists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called US government  How many more times must you be fucked up by these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dilapidated religious fundamentalists&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I will not stop shouting, I am against THIS war. You are deadly wrong
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and you should hear it again every day!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do *any* of these statements belong on this list?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure you understand what ad hominem is or exactly what the list
<br>
rules prohibit.  None of these seem to be obvious personal attacks on
<br>
specific list members.  Many of these are obviously directed at public
<br>
figures, whole political parties, or specific points of view.  Although the
<br>
word &quot;you&quot; is ambiguous and would need to be quoted in context, I don't see
<br>
anything here that remotely is comparable to the kind of personal
<br>
accusations of specific political activities or associations that I
<br>
complained about.  Instead of being attacks on individuals, these seem to be
<br>
attacks on particular political beliefs, which is not against the rules.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Hopefully no one found that post offensive
</em><br>
<p>Not at all.  You directed your arguments at a topic instead of a person.
