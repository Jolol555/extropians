Alex,
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have just purchased it through paypal, along with 500 tonnes of sand to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cover the deck and a few palm trees in really big pots to scatter around. It was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an impulse purchase, So please don't tell my wife.
</em><br>
<p>Har, har, har.... :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Afterthought: Robert, this scenario could make a great book. A mismatched
</em><br>
<em>&gt; band of nerds and techies take to the seas in search of scientific freedom. In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decommissioned Warship.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What do you think ?  :o)
</em><br>
<p>Ask Damien -- he's the &quot;author&quot; on the list.  I'm just a wierd creative techie.
<br>
The only thing I see as necessary as some plot scheme to differentiate it
<br>
from Egan's &quot;Distress&quot;.
<br>
<p>Now, with regard to Russell's comments he is correct -- I'm probably about
<br>
35% serious.  With enough &quot;force of will&quot; we might just pull it off.
<br>
But as Christian pointed out offlist there may be significant problems
<br>
in determining if a ship that old is worth the $4.5M.  Probably some
<br>
serious study would need to be done with regard to the life expectancy
<br>
of &quot;hulls&quot;, &quot;boilers&quot;, &quot;engines&quot;, etc. to know whether or not one is
<br>
purchasing a lemon.  We might also need to consult with Amara as to
<br>
whether the telescope idea holds water -- I'm reasonably convinced
<br>
one can earn revenue based on clear sky remote telescope access but
<br>
I'm not so sure how stable one can keep the viewing on an aircraft
<br>
carrier in the middle of an ocean (which of course varies in
<br>
relative stability).
<br>
<p>With regard to the ideas of doing something on land -- one of the
<br>
points of the exercise is to escape &quot;local&quot; laws.  We have several
<br>
examples in the U.S. over the last 15-20 years as to what happens to
<br>
&quot;cults&quot; that try to go against &quot;local&quot; laws.  So one wants
<br>
something that one can park in international waters where
<br>
&quot;local&quot; laws do not apply.  That doesn't keep the U.S. Navy
<br>
from taking you out with a few cruise missles -- but it would
<br>
be the first instance of an unprovoked attack on an &quot;independent&quot;
<br>
state -- something the U.S. would have to think very seriously
<br>
about from a diplomatic perspective.  [You mean you killed
<br>
a thousand people because they were doing stem cell research
<br>
that you object to based on some strange belief system that is
<br>
2000 years old that 3/5 of the world population does not
<br>
believe in???  Kind of creates problems with any claims for
<br>
a fair or reasonable government].  [If you think fair &amp;
<br>
reasonable are unimportant, see my recent post regarding
<br>
the implications of the competition between China and India
<br>
to attain supremacy in space.]
<br>
<p>Robert
