</em><br>
<p>I'm still on a learning curve, and I don't doubt it.  One of my stock buddy
<br>
mentors (who's been in the business for about 20 years) told me that some of
<br>
the biggest losers he'd seen in the stock market were people who tended to
<br>
analyze things a tad too much.  He told me mathematicians were some of the
<br>
worst investor/traders he'd seen.  This is obviously anecdotal - not real
<br>
evidence - one man's opinion.  But I put all the information I get in a
<br>
mental notebook, and this little anectodal remark I put in the category of:
<br>
&quot;Hmmm, interesting - look into this sometime.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know it's difficult to understand and believe... trust me I spent a big
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chunk of my life as an investment professional who believed and
</em><br>
promulgated
<br>
<em>&gt; the same religion that you hold dear. I stubbornly banged my head for

<br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't hold anything in the stock market dear.  It's always changing, and
<br>
one has to stay flexible (and in as much cash - to capitalize on the
<br>
*running* opportunities - as possible).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fortunately the market does go up over time with the growth of the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economy, so any trading strategy that keeps you long more than short, and
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; more than out, is going to make money over time. However this fact also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; helps to perpetuate the myth that market skill exists. If you don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; understand statistics, and if you don't understand such concepts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opportunity cost, then you will tend to see your profits as evidence of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; trading skill.
</em><br>
<p>I understand statistics, but ... hmmm, it HAS been decades since I took that
<br>
course in college.  But I can give a chart a quick-and-dirty once over.  I
<br>
use other indicators, but confess I've never read about the concept of
<br>
opportunity cost (but am willing to learn).  I barely stayed awake trying to
<br>
understand the Elliott Wave (even though I'm still willing to learn).  But I
<br>
do understand how to &quot;book 'em&quot; - book those profits.  Give the losers the
<br>
heave-ho asap.  Use trailing stops on the winners.  One of my favorite
<br>
quotes of all time is:  &quot;I cried all the way to the bank.&quot; - Liberace
