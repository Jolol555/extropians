Harvey said:
<br>
&lt;&lt;This sounds less extreme, but the logic error is still there.  You cannot
<br>
assume anything about anyone based on a lack of information from them.
<br>
There could be a million reasons why someone doesn't respond.  This tactic
<br>
can never add information to a debate, while it can frequently lead to
<br>
misunderstandings and accusations of misrepresentation.  I maintain that
<br>
this source of information is unsupportable and should not be used in a
<br>
rational debate where the person in question is available for comment if
<br>
they so choose.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Harvey, when the anti-war protestors, actors, comics line up against Son of 
<br>
George, and have never, ever, been heard saying a word against Saddam, or the 
<br>
Saudis, or Bin Ladin, what is a thoughtful person supposed to think? Its the 
<br>
same with the Europeans; they feel free to whine against the perfidies of the 
<br>
USA ( and this was true during Bubba Clinton's administration too!) but say 
<br>
nothing against Islamist tyranies, do nothing to push against Milosevic in Serbia, 
<br>
and always find Israel a proper target no matter what the Islamist or 
<br>
Baathist regimes did or said.
<br>
<p>Therefore, its a wise thing to push back, against those whose standards are 
<br>
silence when it comes to non-American tyrants, rather then just come out of the 
<br>
wood-work as so many leftists have, simply to yowel at W.  There has to be 
<br>
some balance in the world, and it looks like the conservatives have picked up 
<br>
the gauntlet because all others Euros, the Japanese, Africa, and the rest of 
<br>
humakind have opted out on this one.
