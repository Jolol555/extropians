<br>
Yet it does nothing to address the issues.  I've posted my analysis of the 
<br>
situation, the evidence which supports that analysis, and the proposals for 
<br>
future action that arise from it.  All you've posted here are insults, distortions 
<br>
of the views of others, and vague opinions which you have yet to back up.
<br>
<p>MEZ,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have never tried to demonise you.  You are in a tough spot.  However 
<br>
your concrete proposals are nothing but the rehashed proposals I can find in 
<br>
any column by a left wing columnist -- more love, more foreign aid.  You also 
<br>
speak of more firmness in refusing to support despots.  Uncle Sugar is to be 
<br>
all things to all people and to speak harshly only when you approve ahead of 
<br>
time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I offer no vast plans to correct the worlds ills as we elected a 
<br>
government to do exactlly that.  So far they seem to have been exceedingly 
<br>
borebearing but highly effective when they decided to act.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don't try to prove to you the obvious -- we have an old principle in 
<br>
English Common Law that we need not be so objective that we require proof 
<br>
that the sun rises in the morning.  I will not attempt to prove simple matters 
<br>
like the occurance of sunrise.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically I regard this discussion as a waste of the Internet.  The 
<br>
provocation for our conduct is plain.  We were provoked many times before we 
<br>
responded.  We responded effectively and quickly.  In our overall plan of 
<br>
eliminating Al Qaeda we have seemingly moved on to our next strategic goal -- as soon 
<br>
as things clarify a bit more you will find out what it was.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I wish you, your family, especially any left in egypt 
<br>
peace and health.
<br>
