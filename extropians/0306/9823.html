<p>Lasers take 3D brain scans
<br>
<p>Infrared light probes tissue a slice at a time. 
<br>
<p>10 June 2003 GEOFF BRUMFIEL 
<br>
<p>Lasers turn a sample from brains to bits.
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>The system could replace the current methods of imaging soft
<br>
tissue, says one of its developers Jeff Squier, a physicist at
<br>
the Colorado School of Mines. Typically, samples are frozen,
<br>
sliced and dyed, before being examined under the microscope. This
<br>
process can distort key details.
<br>
<p>Squier's team places a fresh, dice-sized sample of rat brain
<br>
tissue in front of a high-powered laser. The laser emits short,
<br>
bright pulses of infrared light that stimulate fluorescent dyes
<br>
that are either genetically engineered or manually brushed into
<br>
the sample. The dye then emits light at a different wavelength
<br>
that is picked up by detectors around the tissue.
<br>
<p>The laser sweeps through the sample, taking a digitized image of
<br>
its surface. Then a second laser burns away scanned tissue and
<br>
the process begins anew. When the whole sample has been scanned,
<br>
all that remains is a digital, three-dimensional picture of the
<br>
chunk of rat brain. &quot;The sample goes from brains to bits,&quot; he
<br>
says.
<br>
<p>Squier presented the first results from the device at last week's
<br>
Conference on Lasers and Electro-Optics in Baltimore, Maryland.
<br>
He developed it in collaboration with researchers at the
<br>
University of California, San Diego and at Science Applications
<br>
International Corporation in Arlington, Virginia.
<br>
<p>Ultimately, laser scanning could automatically create digital
<br>
images in just hours without lab technicians having to
<br>
painstakingly freeze, slice, stain and set samples. A similar
<br>
system is also showing promise in the imaging of rat embryos.
<br>
Traditional techniques can't handle such soft tissue.
