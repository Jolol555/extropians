</em><br>
<p>I think you're getting yourself confused with the language of
<br>
&quot;unconstrained by territory&quot;.  I also note that you simply snipped my
<br>
Bayesian argument, which I took to be the meat of my point.
<br>
<p>Given a theory T and our background theory B, we regard our theory T to
<br>
*more* likely if P(T|~B) is higher, *regardless* of P(B), all else being
<br>
equal.  Do you contest this for some reason?
<br>
<p>Let's suppose I agree with you that any theory T for which P(T|B) and
<br>
P(T|~B) are both high is less &quot;constrained by the territory&quot; than an
<br>
alternate theory T', under which P(T'|B) = P(T|B), but P(T'|~B) is very
<br>
low.  T' is constrained by the territory.  T is less constrained by the
<br>
territory.  Are you trying to tell me, against Bayes, that we should hold
<br>
T' to be more likely than T, because T is &quot;mere philosophy&quot; whereas T' is
<br>
&quot;constrained by the facts&quot;?
<br>
<p>Now, don't get me wrong: being unconstrained by the territory CAN be a bad
<br>
thing.  But it's a bad thing only if you are philosophizing *instead* of
<br>
using all the data that's available.
<br>
<p>(This can happen in at least two seemingly different ways: you may either
<br>
make a claim that is too weak, because you refrain from making a deeper
<br>
correct judgment when only allowing yourself access to some subset of the
<br>
data, or you may make a claim that is false [or not supported as strongly
<br>
as you might think], because it would be contradicted by further evidence
<br>
that you refuse to consider.  A Bayesian would assimilate both types of
<br>
errors as mistakes about the likelihood of certain propositions, either
<br>
too low or too high.)
<br>
<p>But that's not at all the case in my T &amp; T' example, by construction, and
<br>
it doesn't apply to our &quot;Why believe the truth&quot; argument either.
<br>
Nobody's saying that we shouldn't consider the probability of a
<br>
Singularity [P(T|B)] in our calculations.  But we ARE saying that a theory
<br>
that applies well to Singularitarians and non-Singularitarians alike is a
<br>
better theory, more likely to be true, than a theory that applies equally
<br>
well to Singularitarians but not at all to non-Singularitarians, ceteris
<br>
paribus.
<br>
<p>Indeed, this very argument, is all-the-stronger because it has nothing to
<br>
do with being an academic; it has everything to do with the consequences
<br>
of accepting Bayes.
