</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>They could start by letting states negotiate group rates for
<br>
prescription drugs for their residents. As it is, more and more people
<br>
are ordering their prescription drugs out of the country over the
<br>
internet.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind also, the Columbian cartels and the guerrilla groups that
<br>
have many billions of dollars in the bank seem to be dumping the dollar
<br>
as a tactic of financial combat against the backer of their enemy. This
<br>
is becoming a pig pile tactic by many countries which import more from
<br>
the US than they export and don't like our &quot;we're not a punching bag
<br>
anymore&quot; foreign policy.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that deflation is not the same thing as devaluation.
<br>
<p>Deflation is when prices decrease (normally occurs when the value of
<br>
the dollar increases), while devaluation is when the dollar is worth
<br>
less of competetive currencies. Most of the deflationary pressure is
<br>
from falling energy prices (and prices that are impacted by energy
<br>
prices). Since energy prices were previously inflated solely due to war
<br>
jitters, this should not, IMHO, be considered a bad thing, and the
<br>
deflation is not a sign of anything systemically wrong with the
<br>
economy.
<br>
<p>The dollar, somewhat contradictorily, is also devaluing, mostly because
<br>
many countries pissed at our foreign policy are changing how their own
<br>
currencies are anchored, from a dollar standard to a euro standard.
<br>
This also IMHO is actually a paper tiger that is more likely to help us
<br>
than hurt us. It gives the French the false prestige they crave, while
<br>
at the same time inflating the prices of their exports, which will
<br>
negatively impact their economy.
<br>
<p>With decreased demand for dollars overseas, this makes our money cheap
<br>
internationally while at the same time paradoxically of high value
<br>
domestically. This can only be a good thing for the US, and will result
<br>
in a return of many manufacturing jobs to the US, especially skilled
<br>
blue collar jobs. Imports will decrease and exports will increase. The
<br>
trade deficit, an artifact of our currency being the lingua franca of
<br>
international finance, will fade from view and might even become a
<br>
trade surplus. I predict that within a decade the US economy will
<br>
resemble Japan of the 70s and 80's. Consumer savings will skyrocket. A
<br>
speculative bubble of a size never before seen will occur across the
<br>
entire economy, which will last as long as people are confident that
<br>
they are making rational decisions (and so long as the facts they are
<br>
basing those decisions on remain accurate).
