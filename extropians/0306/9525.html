&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The problem is that your phrase &quot;no substantial link&quot; allows
<br>
you to slip, slide and duck better than Muhammad Ali on his best day.
<br>
Of course we found Sadaam giving refuge to terrorists (he apparently
<br>
murdered one in Iraq,
<br>
remember) we found what two or three training camps. but it wouldn't
<br>
be substantial to you regardless.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>mez replies:
<br>
<p>You are perhaps thinking of the camps of Das Es Salaam (I believe I
<br>
have the name right).  That group was operating in an area of Iraq
<br>
controlled by the Kurds, our ostensible allies.
<br>
<p>There is also a group of self-named Mujahadeen who are based in Iraq
<br>
and were, apparently with Saddam's blessing and support, working
<br>
against the government of Iran.  Despite the fact that this group is
<br>
on the US's list of terrorist organizations, the US is now apparently
<br>
considering using them as a ground force to destabilize Iran.  How
<br>
ironic.
<br>
<p>Regardless, there's no evidence that Saddam gave any support to Al
<br>
Queda or any other group that targetted the US.  And there's good
<br>
reason to believe he wouldn't: Saddam is an atheist realist power
<br>
monger.  Al Queda is religious fundamentalist organization with an
<br>
emphasis on martyrdom.
<br>

<p>Ron:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I suggest you get busy and read the postings of the middle
<br>
easterners and the postings of their newspapers on the Internet and
<br>
forget what your anti American, American friends are telling you. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buddy this isn't rocket science, just cast your information net
<br>
a bit wider and start getting informed.
<br>
<p>mez:
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I find this suggestion amusing.  As you may recall from our previous
<br>
conversations on this list, I'm from the middle east, I speak arabic,
<br>
and I spent a few weeks in the region this past December.  Of course I
<br>
read the middle eastern papers.  I also keep up with the content
<br>
published in the Arabic versions that doesn't show up in the English
<br>
translations.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I have no problem discussing this issue with you on the merits, but
<br>
please do not presume to have superior data sources or superior
<br>
insights into the region.
