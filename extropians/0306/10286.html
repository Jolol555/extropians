<em>&gt; &gt; I agree.  The mechanism looks simple to me (not that I'm defending it),

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I said it was not noticeably strong evidence in favor of that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion, and objected only to Harvey saying that it was not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence at all.
</em><br>
<p>Well, it *affects* what one thinks (or suspects)!  Why are
<br>
you going so polarized on this?  Did you misunderstand my
<br>
sentence?  Sorry if so:  please substitute &quot;affect&quot; for 
<br>
&quot;weigh&quot;.  Geez.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In this case C, who conjectures that B supports X, should *ask*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;why shouldn't an attack on A in these circumstances be regarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; as support of X?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not?  Because life is not a two-sided zero-sum game, that's why not.
</em><br>
<p>Probably a case of miscommunication here (maybe my fault).  See
<br>
the asterisks around &quot;ask&quot;?  There is never anything wrong with
<br>
asking, and moreover, you will agree that it would be a HUGE
<br>
improvement over what has been going on!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is *ridiculous* to suppose that *anyone* on the Extropians mailing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list, regardless of their other politics, supports Hussein.  The prior 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; probability is so low that making such a comment is either an ad hominem 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debating tactic, or human tribal thinking resulting in the sheer STUPIDITY 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and WARPING of intellect necessary to distort one's probabilities THAT FAR 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away from the simple COMMON SENSE that NOBODY on the Extropians mailing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list is likely to support Hussein!  What is going on here cannot possibly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be Bayesian reasoning.
</em><br>
<p>Alas, your extremely strong wording is only symptomatic
<br>
of something very bad I fear is happening to you.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You did not respond to my &quot;lip-service&quot; remark.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think that perhaps if B every so often paid lip-service by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; denouncing X, the problems would be less severe.  (Perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; have done this sufficiently enough in your eyes.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not what's going on.  Foaming tribalist fanatics such as are now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appearing on this mailing list - there is no point in mincing words
</em><br>
<p>Oh yes there is!  Your so-called &quot;mincing words&quot; is extremely
<br>
effective flame retardant.  Who're you calling a &quot;foaming
<br>
tribalist fanatic&quot;?  We absolutely must lower the level of
<br>
the rhetoric here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - are not attempting to use &quot;Bayesian reasoning&quot; or even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rationality&quot;; they are acting on blind instinct and pure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; emotion.
</em><br>
<p>Pure emotion?  Isn't this the second time today I've caught
<br>
you in gross exaggeration?  What is happening to you, Eliezer?
<br>
Can't you try for a little detachment here?  You're making
<br>
it so black and white.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; They are thinking in terms of the two-sided zero-sum game;
</em><br>
<p>Irony on irony.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; anyone who does not support Bush must support Hussein, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt; when this conclusion runs in total defiance of simple common 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense about the prior odds.
</em><br>
<p>You are correct.  Anyone committing that fallacy needs
<br>
to be criticized, *individually*.  Are you attempting
<br>
to characterize with these remarks all those who value
<br>
patriotism here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That is how human tribalist thinking works.  One need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only pick up a history book to see this.  I do not need
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to invent more elaborate explanations for this behavior.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Tribal polarization is a human universal and it is quite,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; quite stupid.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree with your sweeping conclusion.  Moreover, I
<br>
think your choice of words very imprudent, especially
<br>
the last one.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I will *not* pay lip-service to it.  That ugly part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of human nature is *my* enemy.
