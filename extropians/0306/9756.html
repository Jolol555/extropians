Patrick stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Pardon me for interjecting,
<br>
The bench scientists are probably lurking, waiting in hope (&amp; desperation) to 
<br>
unearth the occasional posts about science &amp; technology amongst all the 
<br>
political ranting. 
<br>
The ideological stuff is rather off-putting &amp; seems besides the point.
<br>
Patrick&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I disagree because I continuously post articles from Science Daily, Nature, 
<br>
Space.com, and the Physics Pre-Print Archives; and the like, and get little 
<br>
response, except from the few regulars. You would think that some lurking 
<br>
scientist would add their two centavos in on purely, technical, basis; since that is 
<br>
their bailiwick. My conclusion is the vast majority of these people are not 
<br>
drawn to this list for a variety of reasons. Most of which are not germane to 
<br>
politics or polemics. 
<br>
<p>Most scientists, from what I have gathered, are not impressed by the 
<br>
life-extention message, the singularity viewpoint, or the space travel focus. This is 
<br>
applicable to other groups, like the old L-5-ers, Life Extentioners, or most 
<br>
flavors or Transhumanism. The primary reason may be more prosaic then battles 
<br>
about US foreign policy, or gun control, or environmentalism.
<br>
<p>My guess is that, is primarily, these scientists are a hardworking lot, who 
<br>
spend a lot of time on what they love about their work, who are frequently (if 
<br>
they are academics) forced to publish or perish, have their own personal life 
<br>
issues with family, friends, and work.
<br>
<p>What would draw the most attention or interest to our group, our list, our 
<br>
ideas; is,
<br>
I believe, money. We are all opportunistic in an economic and anthropological 
<br>
way, and scientists are no different. Scientists like goodies, no less then a 
<br>
machinist or a gynecologist does. To garner the kind of response from 
<br>
scientists that I would enjoy would take a boodle of cash.
<br>
<p>For example, (grinning) remember the Monkees? The Guitarist, Mike Nesmith, 
<br>
who later sold the idea of music videos to CBS, which went on to found MTV, is a 
<br>
bit of a science buff. Supposedly (recalling from an old Wired Magazine 
<br>
article) Nesmith has hired scientists like Nobel Prize winner, Murray Gell-Man, and 
<br>
several other lights of science to lecture and inform him of their 
<br>
specialties in science. Nesmith's mother was also the inventor of liquid paper :-)  and 
<br>
so Nesmith funds these scientists for a personal lecture(s). Well, you might 
<br>
see my point, even if you disagree with my premise. Extropianism and 
<br>
Transhumanism will require major funds to promote itself and attract more than the 
<br>
passionate few, such as ourselves.
