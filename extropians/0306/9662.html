Jumping in:
<br>
<p>I think the problem here is that &quot;dissuasion&quot; is difficult to guarantee (or 
<br>
validate), just as is &quot;persuasion&quot;.
<br>
<p>I don't think this situation has a tidy solution; nor a quick one, apart 
<br>
from the Albigensian approach (&quot;Kill them all; God will know his own&quot;, in 
<br>
the apocryphal wording). This is grievous.
