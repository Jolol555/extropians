of capital is NOT a problem for the average citizen of a TWC. That is a BIG 
<br>
problem. 20K dollars is very hard to come by there. And 20K gives you a lot of 
<br>
power in a TWC.  20K in my bank account here makes me no big deal. But 20K in 
<br>
India puts me in an elite group.  Now, as someone else pointed out, and to 
<br>
which I elaborated, most TWCs are strangled by a parasitic bureaucracy.  This

**could** be a problem for Americans who wanted to seize upon the opportunity to 
<br>
start a business in a TWC.  
<br>
<p>Cryofan,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me address those comments.  Let's start with &quot;I disagree with the 
<br>
poster who earlier said that lack of capital is NOT a problem for the average 
<br>
citizen of a TWC.&quot;  You have just encountered one of the chief points made by 
<br>
de Soto after years of study with a team of investigators.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The point is subtle enough that you and de Soto are not necessarily 
<br>
saying the same thing but the distinction is sometimes hard to detect.  De Soto 
<br>
is saying that the necessary capital exists in each of those countries to lift 
<br>
them up -- but listen to the other comment you made, &quot;Most TWCs are strangled 
<br>
by a parasitic bureaucracy.&quot;  Therein lies the nub of de Soto's argument.  
<br>
BTW, we once had the same problems all across the Western Nations and especially 
<br>
here in America.  We had an on going war for most of a century before we 
<br>
settled the affair.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those bureaucracies you say are strangling countries are in fact 
<br>
strangling TW countries and furthermore that is exactly what they were designed to 
<br>
do.  Our old guild system and the medieval governments were designed to keep 
<br>
control in the hands of a favored few.  So are the bureaucracies of the TWCs.  
<br>
They keep things in a state so that no outsider can start any kind of a new 
<br>
business.  One of the chief ways they do that in modern terms is to keep 
<br>
individuals from getting clear title to private property.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The individuals form protective associations to protect their 
<br>
ownership in their homes or small businesses.  But that is where the problem starts.  
<br>
If I cannot get a title to my property then I can't sell or borrow against it 
<br>
to raise capital to start a new business.  De Soto makes the argument that 
<br>
this method is the chief way people raise the cash to start a new business.  
<br>
Nowadays if I want to start a business I can get a mortgage on my house and I am 
<br>
up, up and away.  A TWC citizen can't do that because he has nothing admissible 
<br>
in court to prove ownership.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore people are more reluctant in a TWC to sign a contract with 
<br>
you.  In this country if you fail to live up your contract I can have a 
<br>
private detective follow you home.  I can look up the ownership in your property, 
<br>
automobile, etc., and sue your hip pockets off.  In a TWC I can't do that 
<br>
because there is no paper trail showing what you own.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is the subtle difference.  De Soto also points out that mostly we 
<br>
need education because once a revolutionary or politician on the make 
<br>
understands de Soto's argument they have found the citizenry pick up on the idea 
<br>
fast.  At that time the revolutionary or politician has found himself a win-win 
<br>
situation.  No vast sums of money or the heavy arm of Uncle Sam is necessary.  
<br>
In fact we would probably be counter productive if we were present at all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, if you please I want to reach way out in left field and pull in a 
<br>
personal idea.  Let me put it in the form of a question.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many have commented that we have a brighter than average group here on 
<br>
the Extropian list.  Herrnstein in the Bell Curve argues that bright groups 
<br>
like this are coming together all over America.  That is all he had statistics 
<br>
for but it seems plain to me that the same is happening in Europe, indeed 
<br>
across the globe.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the old days before a hundred years ago the bright people were 
<br>
scattered through the population according to Herrnstein.  Without getting tied 
<br>
down in an argument about whether he was an adequate statistician ask yourself 
<br>
two questions:
<br>
1.  Do you see sufficient evidence around you to make you believe bright 
<br>
people might be communicating with each other more intensely that in the long ago 
<br>
past -- pre 1900 AD?  As I said, I think this is observably true at least as a 
<br>
trend.
<br>
2.  What do you suppose the effect will be of these people congregating in 
<br>
places like the Extropy list and exchanging information?  Once upon a time even 
<br>
some very bright people didn't get to converse with a Robin Hanson on 
<br>
Economics or Investing.  There are other discussions on these pages about longevity, 
<br>
health, etc.  I say these discussion will have a profound effect upon people 
<br>
and eventually our entire civilization.  Have you been exposed to the ideas of 
<br>
John Taylor Gatto on public education?  What he says is having a tremendous 
<br>
effect for either good or ill and the rest of us had best inform ourselves.
<br>
Ron h.
