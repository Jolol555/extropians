This post showed up on the board (bulletin board) and not the mailing list,
<br>
(I believe only mailing list subsribers get their messages sent out to the
<br>
mailing list?) Since it addresses some of my comments and a common argument
<br>
I wanted to post a rebuttal to it.
<br>
<p>posted from a newbie named &quot;XXX&quot;
<br>
<p>Damien said:
<br>
<em>&gt; When I hear that Saddam and his sons and regime tortured and murdered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, I am horrified; when I hear that US jails contain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prisoners many of them incarcerated for using marijuana and subjected in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prison to rampant rape and brutality, I am horrified as well.
</em><br>
<p>...but are you equally horrified? !!!!!!!!
<br>
<p>&quot;No, actually *more* so, because the latter crimes against humanity take
<br>
place in a supposedly &quot;civilized&quot; country, and, more importantly, a country
<br>
that seeks to impose its brand of sanctimonious, hypocritical &quot;morality&quot; and
<br>
&quot;justice&quot; on the rest of the planet, **and has the means to do so**.&quot;
<br>
<p>Here is the common argument, the US has no right to impost any of its morals
<br>
on the rest of the world unless the US is perfect.  This is what this
<br>
particular poster is saying.  Lets ask if the people of Iraq would find it
<br>
worse or better to be threatened with jail time if they are caught smoking
<br>
pot (something relatively rare, actually serving time in prison for smoking
<br>
pot only) or be raped, tortured, and executed for merely speaking out
<br>
against Hussein.  I should note that 50,000 Shiites were murdered in the
<br>
uprising that followed gulf war I, and recent mass grave figures range in
<br>
the 300,000 range.  To imply that the people of Iraq would prefer to live in
<br>
the same brutal dictatoral state of gulags harboring torture devices and
<br>
execution squads until a perfect utopian world arises is despicable,
<br>
intellectually foul, and morally corrupt.  Each incremental step toward a
<br>
better life is valued.
<br>
<p>These same arguments are shouted by leftists America is evil revisionist
<br>
historians who insisted that the US had no right to impose its systems, with
<br>
such failings as racism, wage gaps, and drug laws, onto other countries,
<br>
countries which typically lived under murderous tyrants and despicable
<br>
oppressive enslaving thugs.
<br>
<p>Again, a prime example of twisted ethics, the US must be absolutely perfect
<br>
before imposing its crazy western ideals of free speech, market based
<br>
economies, equal rights, and constitutional republic democracies on any
<br>
other country.  Absurd.  Another example of someone not thinking out the
<br>
implications of their ethical stances.
<br>
<p>Additionally, I would ask XXX what in particular would represent a perfect
<br>
US, so that the US could finally impose its values abroad (or, a perfect
<br>
moral state for that matter)  And I would ask XXX how he/she intends to
<br>
prove that their system is perfect to the people who feel it is not.  I
<br>
should note that some people think that drug laws are moral (I do not) but
<br>
nearly everyone in the world (except murderous dictators, and perhaps a few
<br>
members of this mailing list) actually acknowledge that murdering is wrong.
<br>
<p>&quot;If the self-appointed globocop is in fact crooked, that's MAJOR PROBLEM,
<br>
IMHO. Iraq and other such &quot;rogue&quot; (ooh, naughty!) nations are relatively
<br>
harmless,&quot;
<br>
<p>They are not harmless to the people that live inside them, you are nothing
<br>
less than a selfish jingoist.  Who cares if 100's of thousands of Iraqs are
<br>
tortured, raped, and arbitrially murdered, as long as they dont bother you!!
<br>
Crooked by whos standards, yours?  What would constitute a non-crooked
<br>
global cop?
<br>
<p>&quot;and whatever threat they pose(d) isn't / wasn't removed by invading them.
<br>
Maybe even on the contrary... Apart from that, the whole War on Terror is
<br>
just another farce, or rather a cynical power grab by the US / Israeli power
<br>
structure.&quot;
<br>
<p>Ah yes, the zionist conspiracies.  *sigh*
<br>
<p>&quot; &quot;They&quot; probably &quot;knew&quot;, and thought something along the lines of &quot;Hot
<br>
damn, now there's a mighty fine opportunity to advance our fascist, err
<br>
*patriotic* agenda.&quot;
<br>
<p>Fascist?  I think you need to check your dictionary, the US is a democratic
<br>
constitutional republic.  Compare that with the leadership of IRAQ.
<br>
<p>&quot;Let's pull another Pearly Harbor, and them stupid sheep will be bleating
<br>
for (even) more state control. SUCKERS!&quot;&quot;&quot;
<br>
<p>You are no less of a sheep than you assert others to be, uncritically
<br>
accepting all the arguments presented to you that happen to coincide with
<br>
your own worldview.  Answer the objections posed to your criticisms and well
<br>
see how much of a sheep you are or are not.
<br>
