<em>&gt;Or think about it this way. There has to be certain private vaults within

<p>&nbsp;It's not obvious to me that we will continue to need such vaults.
<br>
Passwords may become obsolete because pervasive surveillance makes it
<br>
too hard to use without eavesdroppers seeing them.
<br>
&nbsp;Beliefs about investments can remain valuable enough for people to
<br>
put effort into creating them if they are inspected infrequently enough
<br>
that it is normally possible to act upon them before they are inspected.
<br>
Inspection would presumably reduce the returns on such knowledge, but
<br>
that's probably a good result because it implies markets are being made
<br>
more efficient.
<br>
&nbsp;If we need such vaults, it's probably for things like making bad laws
<br>
hard to enforce. That need is hard to predict over the time periods
<br>
we're talking about.
