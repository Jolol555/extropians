Have we been limited by Google?

<br>
Google may be an amazing database of webpages, however, Google certainly is 
<br>
not a comprehensive database. I wanted to find out how many webpages have &lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.google.com.au/services/index.html">http://www.google.com.au/services/index.html</a>&quot;&gt;
<br>
Google WebSearch&lt;/A&gt; on them. Typically these display text similar to &quot;Powered by 
<br>
Google&quot;, although this is not always true. I soon learnt how much is edited out of 
<br>
the web by Google through trying to build a comprehensive database of sites 
<br>
carrying the &quot;Powered by Google&quot; label.
<br>
<p>Narrowing the Web World
<br>
First of all, we need to understand the Google Inc., strategy of what in fact 
<br>
it is building. In an article talking about the <A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,58497-2,00.html">Grub Project</A> [seeking to 
<br>
index the whole of the web] Peter Norving, the Director of Search at Google Inc., 
<br>
describes the Google strategy. Peter Norving does not consider crawling the 
<br>
web more, and getting more into the Google database is the problem. Rather he 
<br>
considers the problem to be fundamentally how to narrow the index:
<br>
&quot;Going from tens of thousands of machines to hundreds of thousands of 
<br>
machines is fundamentally going to change the nature of search,&quot; Stechert said. 
<br>
&quot;Going to millions of machines allows us to ask, ‘What can we do with all that 
<br>
computing power?’&quot; 
<br>
<p>But Peter Norvig, director of search quality at Google, said while the Grub 
<br>
project is topical and interesting; improving Web searches isn't a problem of 
<br>
widening an index, but narrowing it.
<br>
[<A HREF="http://www.wired.com/news/infostructure/0,1377,58497-2,00.html">Wired</A>]
<br>
<p><p>AND how they have narrowed it is surely interesting. Look at this example of 
<br>
what we found when we tried to build a comprehensive list of sites bearing the 
<br>
words &quot;Powered by Google&quot;.
<br>
<p>Our Search for &quot;Powered by Google&quot;
<br>
First we searched in Google using the following search query:
<br>
<p>&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=search+%22powered+by+google%22+-translate+-google-com&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=y&amp;start=900&amp;sa=N&amp;filter=0">http://www.google.com/search?q=search+%22powered+by+google%22+-translate+-google-com&amp;num=100&amp;hl=en&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=utf-8&amp;safe=off&amp;as_qdr=y&amp;start=900&amp;sa=N&amp;filter=0</a>-google-com&lt;/A&gt;
<br>
restricted to one year and in English
<br>
<p>At the time of writing this article there were 713,000 results indicated in 
<br>
the Google information bar. 
<br>
<p>Next we started working our way down the list to see each of the results. We 
<br>
wanted to be sure that a Google WebSearch box was on each of the sites listed. 
<br>
We excluded any pages in the Google domain and any sites that displayed 
<br>
Translation Powered by Google.
<br>
<p>NOTE THIS: Even though Google has 713,000 results for this search, you and I 
<br>
can only see 998 of them. Google physically will not serve any more pages up 
<br>
than that for that particular search. Even though there are another 712,002 
<br>
results for that search, we cannot see any more!! Google simply just does not 
<br>
serve any more pages past that number.
<br>
<p>AllTheWeb Behavior
<br>
We turned to see whether <A HREF="http://www.alltheweb.com/">AllTheWeb</A>, a search engine in competition with 
<br>
Google, would reveal anything more. Our search in AllTheWeb was a similar search:
<br>
<p>&lt;A HREF=&quot;<a href="http://www.alltheweb.com/search?t=adv&amp;q=search+AND+%22powered+by+google%22+ANDNOT+%22google.com%22&amp;c=web&amp;cs=iso-8859-1&amp;ics=iso-8859-1&amp;o=3900&amp;h=100&amp;l=en&amp;no=on&amp;qtf=n&amp;av=1&amp;wf%5Bn%5D=4&amp;wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=google.com&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Bw">http://www.alltheweb.com/search?t=adv&amp;q=search+AND+%22powered+by+google%22+ANDNOT+%22google.com%22&amp;c=web&amp;cs=iso-8859-1&amp;ics=iso-8859-1&amp;o=3900&amp;h=100&amp;l=en&amp;no=on&amp;qtf=n&amp;av=1&amp;wf%5Bn%5D=4&amp;wf%5B0%5D%5Br%5D=%2B&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Br%5D=-&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Bq%5D=google.com&amp;wf%5B1%5D%5Bw</a>r%5Bm%5D=1&amp;dfr%5By%5D=1980&amp;dto%5Bd%5D=18&amp;dto%5Bm%5D=6&amp;dto%5By%5D=2003&quot;&gt;search AND &quot;powered by google&quot; ANDNOT &quot;google.com&quot;&lt;/A&gt;
<br>
<p>Even though AllTheWeb reveals that it has only 477,231 results in its 
<br>
database, AlTheWeb actually displays more results to us than Google. You are able to 
<br>
see 4,000 results of the 477,231 possible results. We actually learnt more 
<br>
about the &quot;Powered by Google&quot; phrase by researching the results from AllTheWeb 
<br>
than we did from the Google results page. There was more to research...&gt;&gt;
