<p>At least this is the article I was thinking about - unfortunately I read it
<br>
a long time ago, and crucial numbers flipped in my memory - the study shows
<br>
only a very modest absolute reduction of the plaque (the relative reduction
<br>
compared to pre-treatment was quite substantial).
<br>
<p>So, well, I guess I goofed up, there is no proof that plaque in adults is
<br>
largely reversible. Still, there is no proof to the opposite, either, and
<br>
the ApoE mice, as well as presence of unmodified cholesterol in the plaque
<br>
support the equilibrium hypothesis.
<br>
<p>I guess we should for now conclude that there is insufficient quantitative
<br>
data to decide in favor of either hypothesis.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Chinnery specified the &quot;maintenance of wild-type mechanism&quot;, yes,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but AFAIK he didn't say that random fluctuations are irreversible and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; cannot push the total number of genomes back down (except when driven
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; to homoplasmy).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He said that the total number can fall due to random fluctuations, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be &quot;pushed&quot; down.  That's where the bias in directionality comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from: there is no push either way when the number of wild-types is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sufficient, but there's an upward push when it isn't.
</em><br>
<p>### This sounds reasonable.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Ah, but it's not just as seen in real life: this is the whole problem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We see two clear deviations from real life in his model: (1) his model
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predicts lots of proliferation at modest heteroplasmy (say, under
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 50%),
</em><br>
<p>### Can you quote Chinnery on that?
<br>
<p>----------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thresholds don't help re
<br>
<em>&gt; the former, because in Chinnery's model the only reason there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threshold is that there's a maximum number of mt genomes in total (wt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plus mutant).
</em><br>
<p>### I didn't get this one. Chinnery specifically predicts biochemical
<br>
threshold effects for mutations with high E (the efficiency parameter). This
<br>
would not be dependent on any maximum number of mt genomes, and does not
<br>
predict lots of proliferation at modest heteroplasmy (see Fig 7 and page 578
<br>
in the J.Theor Biol article).
<br>
<p>---------
<br>
&nbsp;and (2) it predicts (for parameters chosen to give the observed
<br>
<em>&gt; number of COX-negative cells) a lot more heteroplasmic cells than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; homoplasmic (or very nearly) mutant cells.
</em><br>
<p>### Can you quote him?
<br>
<p>See fig 5 and p 580, where he says that within his model the levels of
<br>
mutations and COX negativity can vary independently of each other.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Really?  I thought only a few types block PCR (eg thymine dimers).
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But I'm not well up on that, so I take your word for it.
</em><br>
<p>### Bulky adducts do block PCR, although I should qualify it by saying that
<br>
I don't know the relative abundance of various adducts in the mtDNA.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; BTW, I just read the abstract of your paper in Protoplasma - sounds
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; intriguing, but the full text is not available online. Could you send
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; me a copy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I actually don't have full-text access, even though Cambridge does get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the journal in hard copy.  If you (or anyone else reading!) can get it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (<a href="http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00709/tocs/t3221001.htm">http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00709/tocs/t3221001.htm</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and my article is the second in the issue), I would be most grateful!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>### Thanks, I got it.
