<p>I'm suggesting that it may not be that easy, just yet.  See:

<p>Yep, they seem to have already done it for drydock work on the hull.

<p>O.K.  A recreational boat is a far cry from a large ship.  When I worked
<br>
on the R.V. Shell America, a sizable fraction of the crew spent all day,
<br>
every day, working from one end of the superstructure to the other.  The
<br>
flate surfaces were rarely a problem.  It was the welds, around doors and
<br>
portholes, deck equipment, masts, etc.  That alone was more than enough
<br>
work.  The hull was done during annual drydock by contractors.
<br>
<p>A robot that could only do a regular area (like a vacuum cleaner robot) 
<br>
would not significantly reduce the amount of work at sea (as opposed to
<br>
drydock). It would have to deal with serious irregularities, deep
<br>
crevices, corners, both vertical and horizontal surfaces (underneath and
<br>
overhead).  Developing such a robot would, in my opinion, be as large or
<br>
larger a project as purchasing and outfitting the boat to begin with.
<br>
<p>On the plus side, if you did create such a robot, it might pay for the
<br>
ship.  Merchantmen wouldn't be interested...overseas labor is too cheap.
<br>
But the Navy might like it.
