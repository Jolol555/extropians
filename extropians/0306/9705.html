<p>He is neither.  It really is not that hard to tell the difference.
<br>
<p>If you look over the archived debate, it is clear that Flandern is 
<br>
misrepresenting modern physics, that people have tried to explain this to 
<br>
him, and that they have failed because Flandern doesn't understand the 
<br>
math.  Moreover it is clear that the existing theory makes predictions 
<br>
which differ from Flandern's and that the experimental evidence confirms 
<br>
the existing theory.
<br>
<p>Being a crank has nothing to do with whether you have a doctorate.  You 
<br>
can have a doctorate in an unrelated field and still be a crank.  What 
<br>
defines a crank is ignorance of the basics of an experimentally 
<br>
established field about which they choose to advance theories.  Flandern 
<br>
is a crank and an easily recognizable one.
<br>
<p>(Though, oddly enough, it is possible to have AI cranks, such as Mentifex, 
<br>
despite the lack of any experimentally established AI theories for them to 
<br>
disagree with.  It would appear that a crank in a chaotic field is still a 
<br>
crank.)
<br>
<p>It really is not hard to tell who has the ball.  Where Flandern is 
<br>
concerned, the existing theory of general relativity has the ball, and 
<br>
Flandern is a crank.  Where, say, nanotech is concerned, Drexler has the 
<br>
ball, and until Smalley figures out how to address the existing literature 
<br>
and argue quantitatively, Smalley is simply embarassing himself.  Yes, 
<br>
there are people who assign &quot;crankhood&quot; by checking credentials, and these 
<br>
people are harmful to science because science is not about credentials. 
<br>
But if you actually *read the arguments* passing back and forth, it is 
<br>
rarely if ever difficult to tell who the crank is.
