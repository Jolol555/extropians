<br>
<p><em>    &gt; it [911] certainly got the Bush  administration to draw up
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;a road map to peace rather quickly.
</em><br>
<p>It wasn't 911 that caused the recent peace scare, it was because Saddam was
<br>
no longer around so Israel felt more comfortable making concessions. It
<br>
didn't amount to anything of course, as in the past just as it looked like a
<br>
settlement might be possible a Palestinian straps on some dynamite and blows
<br>
up a school bus.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; And in regards to Jews, you've just acknowledged they're killing
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;people on a regular basis.
</em><br>
<p>That's what war is about, killing people, and Israel has been no more brutal
<br>
about it than any other large military power, better than most in fact. And
<br>
I've asked this question several times but never got an answer, if the
<br>
incredible rage in the Islamic community that has no rival in the modern
<br>
world was really caused because they thought a tiny sub group of them that
<br>
most have never seen and lived thousands of miles away were mistreated then
<br>
you would expect an ever greater homicidal rage in another people who were
<br>
far far more horribly treated. So why are Jews not crashing airliners into
<br>
German skyscrapers?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Doing it piecemeal doesn't make it any less horrifying than doing it
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;all at once
</em><br>
<p>Nonsense, of course it's more horrifying, two murders are twice as bad as
<br>
one and six million murders are six times worse than one million.
<br>
<p><em>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt; Brotherhood? Muslims have killed far more Muslims than
</em><br>
<em>        &gt;&gt;the West could  ever dream of doing.
</em><br>
<p><em>     &gt;Same could be said of Christianity
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and your point being....
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;its  generally politics that gets  people killed, not religions
</em><br>
<p>Are you trying to tell me with a straight face it's just a coincidence that
<br>
for centuries one side of the war in Ireland was Catholic and the other
<br>
Protestant, and in India one side was Muslim and the other Hindu, and in Sri
<br>
Lanka one side was Buddhist and the other Hindu, and in the mid east one
<br>
side was Jewish and the other Muslim?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I think it [ democracy] will satisfy them; and thats what its all
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;about eh?
</em><br>
<p>You think that do you, I don't.  I don't think democracy is what it's all
<br>
about, freedom is, but the group we're talking about would disagree, they
<br>
would say Islam is what it's all about.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;guerilla warfare with extremely motivated troops can overcome any
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;technology based advantages.
</em><br>
<p>Any technological advantage? I don't think so, just ask the Afghans or the
<br>
Iraqis; or the Aztecs or the Incas for that matter, the most one sided wars
<br>
in history .
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Israel the state is the bad guy in my world picture
</em><br>
<p>I don't have a major problem with that, but you also think the Arabs are the
<br>
good guys in the white hats and I do have a major problem with that.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;I do acknowledge they [Jews] have a right to live there.
</em><br>
<p>How very big of you, but don't say that around any Palestinians, they'll
<br>
kill you dead for making such a concession, their idea of a concession is to
<br>
drive all Israelis into the sea.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;The state of Israel is simply too destablizing to the region.
</em><br>
<p>For good or ill the state of Israel exists and it's not going away, at least
<br>
not until generations of warfare have turned the mid east into a wasteland.
<br>
If you want peace you must learn to live with it, this is not a moral
<br>
statement it is a pragmatic one. And I don't really know what you mean by
<br>
destabilizing anyway, you blasted America for destabilizing the region then
<br>
you blasted America for preserving the Status Quo, you can't have it both
<br>
ways.
