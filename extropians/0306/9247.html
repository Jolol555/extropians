</em><br>
<p>Extropes,
<br>
<p>This is an idea to which I've devoted many &quot;sessions
<br>
of sweet silent thought&quot;.
<br>
<p>Regarding the cost of maintenance/operation.  If
<br>
you're cruisin the world, it's gonna cost more than if
<br>
you just park it and live on it.  Also, if you just
<br>
park it, you can coat the hull with concrete,
<br>
whereupon rust and electrochemical corrosion of the
<br>
hull ceases to be an issue (remember the bad boy oil
<br>
tanker in &quot;Waterworld&quot;?)
<br>
<p>If you want to cruise on the cheap, and don't need to
<br>
go fast, you could turn it into a sailboat.  If you
<br>
don't need to land and launch airplanes, that big flat
<br>
open deck presents a world of possibilities.
<br>
<p>In 1971 I worked for a ship breaker in the old Kaiser
<br>
shipyard in Richmond, Ca.  We took apart a jeep
<br>
carrier that had been sold for scrap from the US
<br>
mothball fleet.  I led a crew that went through the
<br>
interior taking out all things flammable.  We stacked
<br>
mattresses from the crew quarters onto bomb dollies,
<br>
hauled them out to the hanger deck, and then threw
<br>
them down onto the dock below.  This to certify the
<br>
ship fire safe for cutting apart with acetelyne
<br>
torches.  Actually, the ship was too big to fit in the
<br>
drydock whole, so first it had to be cut in half, and
<br>
then dismantled by halves.
<br>
<p>SJ Van Sickle rightly notes that used ships are
<br>
plentiful, and cruise ships are purposefully designed
<br>
more for human habitation than an aircraft carrier.
<br>
(But an aircraft carrier is without a doubt way cooler
<br>
than a lamo cruise ship.)
<br>
<p>The $850K cruise ships he offers for our consideration
<br>
has 120 cabins.  If you figure another 50 living
<br>
quarters for crew, that gives 170 separate living
<br>
spaces.  That's $5K per, out the door fully paid off. 
<br>
(Tax, title, and insurance extra, natch.)  Whatta
<br>
deal!
<br>
While the aircraft carrier, at $4.5 mil, doesn't
<br>
submit so readily to the dollars-per-living-space
<br>
calculation, the bottom line is in the same ballpark,
<br>
ie, chickenfeed.
<br>
<p>My recommendation:  start with one aircraft carrier
<br>
and one cruise ship, park them in the southern part of
<br>
San Francisco Bay at the precise confluence of San
<br>
Mateo, Santa Clara, and Alameda counties.  (So when
<br>
whichever county tax collector comes along, you simply
<br>
say, &quot;We're not in 'your' county&quot;, or alternately,
<br>
&quot;We're not in 'your' county for a sufficient fraction
<br>
of the year to sustain a tax liability&quot;, or
<br>
alternately, use your mobility to play the three
<br>
counties off against one another for the best tax
<br>
deal. Remember, are they really gonna provide you with
<br>
police, schools, roads, fire protection, utilities,
<br>
garbage pick-up, sewage treatment, or anything else to
<br>
justify their tax levy?  Like I said, I've thought
<br>
about this a lot.)
<br>
<p>If you can deal with the regulatory nightmare, you can
<br>
have an outrageous club/condo/commercial hotspot. 
<br>
Otherwise go for private ownership coop.  Where else
<br>
in the Bay Area--or for that matter any location
<br>
within shouting disance of civilization--can you get
<br>
your own private home in your own private floating
<br>
city for $5K-$10K.
<br>
<p>Bay Area Extropians comprise only a fraction of the
<br>
larger Bay Area lifestyle adventurers who would love
<br>
this idea.  Every tribe it's own boat in the
<br>
Extropian-initiated Geeklandia fleet.  A Star Trek
<br>
boat: the Enterprise no doubt.  A
<br>
OpenSource/coders/hackers boat.  A Gay boat (it is San
<br>
Francisco after all.) A gamer boat.  A SciFi boat.  A
<br>
hippy boat.  A heavily-armed Libertarian boat. etc.  
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;We don't see things as they are, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;we see them as we are.&quot; 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anais Nin
