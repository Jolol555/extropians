<p><em>&gt; I haven't been following all of this thread but I'd be

</em><br>
<p>He's way out on the end of the bell curve. Unfortunately for every Warren
<br>
Buffet there is a Warren Not-So-Buffet who lost his shirt with an equally
<br>
reasonable strategy. 
<br>
<p>It is only in hindsight that we can say what strategies were really &quot;wise&quot;
<br>
over any given time period. We don't know what the future holds.
<br>
<p>The biggest obstacle for most people is understanding the nature of risk,
<br>
and how it relates to returns. Warren Buffet has done very well, but not
<br>
nearly as well as people think after we factor in the risks he incurred to
<br>
get those returns. Companies whose shares trade at low price/earnings ratios
<br>
and low price/book-value ratios (Buffet's favorites) trade at low multiples
<br>
for a very good reason: they are troubled companies with dim business
<br>
prospects. In *retrospect* the economy has done phenomenally well in
<br>
Buffet's experience, such that these companies did not go bankrupt as often
<br>
as they otherwise would have, giving the impression that his investments
<br>
were not as risky as they were in reality and allowing him to show a
<br>
superior return. Unfortunately we cannot say with any certainty that the
<br>
economy of the future will be as kind to Buffet imitators as it was to
<br>
Buffet. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... but do you really think the Warren Buffet's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; success is a mere statistical phenomenom. It could have been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyone and just happened to be him?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Is this you contention? 
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In fairness it would seem that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bias against the view that such strategies could exist might
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appeal to one that has not stumbled across a particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy as well. So I guess the fair question is in what way
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are the alternate hypothesis falsifiable? How could you rule
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out all strategies rather than merely those that you may have tried?
</em><br>
<p>Strictly speaking, I am saying that there is no evidence that any strategies
<br>
exist to outperform the market after adjustments for risk and after
<br>
considering transaction costs. 
<br>
<p>I am saying also that, given that lack of evidence, and given the many
<br>
failed attempts by academics and other objective observers to the find that
<br>
evidence, it is most rational to accept as our working hypothesis the
<br>
hypothesis that the market is an efficient pricing mechanism. 
<br>
<p>To say that the market is efficient is to say that the best estimate of the
<br>
intrinsic value of any given company at time t is reflected by the price of
<br>
its shares at time t, and that to the extent there is any pricing error at
<br>
time t, that error cannot be exploited systematically.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Aside: I am often mildly amused at the statements of people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who by bizzare acident find themselves sitting up in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hospitals describing themselves as very lucky because they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; narrowly avoided a still worst fate. 
</em><br>
<p>That always make me laugh too. :)
