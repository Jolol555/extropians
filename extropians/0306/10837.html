Sorry to be slow responding to this - I did some travelling over the
<br>
weekend and then was busy at work through today.
<br>
<p>Lee Corbin had written:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;   Question: Are you suggesting or do you suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   that no one ever issue the accusation &quot;You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   engaging in X&quot;, where X is against the list rules?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   Question: Are you saying that if someone believes
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   he or she has been attacked, then it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   against the list rules to respond?
</em><br>
<p>No, I don't think either of these is true.
<br>
<p>If you can engage in a response when you have been attacked without
<br>
resorting to personal attacks yourself, that's fine.  It takes
<br>
considerable self control so I don't think many people can accomplish it,
<br>
but if you can ignore the insults and just respond calmly on the issues,
<br>
more power to you.
<br>
<p>In my opinion it is more questionable to accuse someone of violating the
<br>
list rules (a practice I myself have engaged in recently).  That could
<br>
easily cross the line into a personal attack.  If you just mention it
<br>
as a mild observation, that seems okay.  But the recommended practice,
<br>
especially if you are upset about it, is not to argue it out on the list,
<br>
but to get the moderator(s) involved, presently me.
<br>
