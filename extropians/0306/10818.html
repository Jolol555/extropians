<p>I think you may be making things overly simple.  When the WS
<br>
gene is defective, it produces DNA deletions (*that* is very
<br>
bad) due to its exonuclease activity (Oshima J et al, Cancer Res
<br>
Jan 2002).  It appears that p53 is responsible for regulating
<br>
the exonuclease activity of the WS protein (Brosh RM, et al
<br>
JBC Sep 2001).  Now it may be that MYC is upregulating the
<br>
production of WRN resulting in a gene dosage imbalance with
<br>
p53 that allows the exonuclease activity to proceed when it
<br>
is undesirable to do so.  But there appear to be other players
<br>
since WRN can be phosphorylated at one or more locations.
<br>
<p>So I wouldn't point the finger at MYC until it becomes clearer
<br>
when WRN is supposed to function as a helicase and when it is
<br>
supposed to function as an exonuclease.  Before we are done with
<br>
this I think we are going to find that exonucleases in general
<br>
(WRN, Artemis, etc.) may be an interesting, perhaps even significant,
<br>
part of the puzzle.
