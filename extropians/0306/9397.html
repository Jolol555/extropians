</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to refuse to consider pretty much all possibilities other than the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actual state of the universe.
</em><br>
<p>It's not just that the universe knew it, it's that the evidence was 
<br>
actually embodied in the shape of my mind at birth - that this was a human 
<br>
mind and not a posthuman one.  For there to be priors, evidence, and 
<br>
posterior, there must actually be a mind that holds the prior, an 
<br>
encounter with the evidence, and then updating to the posterior.  In this 
<br>
case, you're trying to extrapolate back from before the prior...
<br>
<p>Actually, this argument is now disintegrating because I'm trying to phrase 
<br>
it in a language that I have learned is wrong.  Let me try again.
<br>
<p>Let's say that we have a doctor, a patient who may or may not have cancer, 
<br>
and a mammogram.  Before the doctor sees the mammogram, we can calibrate 
<br>
the doctor's pointer state directly by figuring the frequency of that 
<br>
pointer state next to patients with the environmental fact of cancer. 
<br>
After the doctor sees the mammogram, we can, if we like, recalibrate the 
<br>
doctor's pointer state directly by figuring the frequency of that pointer 
<br>
state next to patients with the environmental fact of cancer.  If the 
<br>
doctor knows the correct probabilities throughout, the relation between 
<br>
the doctor's calculated probabilities will obey Bayes' Theorem, just as 
<br>
the actual correlation between the pointer states and the environment 
<br>
obeys the naturalistic version of Bayes' Theorem.
<br>
<p>In other words, we have the interesting fact that the calibration of 
<br>
pointer states, as it changes over time, obeys Bayes' Theorem with respect 
<br>
to environmental correlations borne by incoming evidence.  This is why 
<br>
Bayes' Theorem works.  Or to put it another way, this is a naturalistic 
<br>
description of the fact that Bayes' Theorem works.
<br>
<p>It looks to me like you're trying to extrapolate back my pointer state to 
<br>
a prior that I never actually had, that is poorly defined (what is the set 
<br>
of observers?), and where many of the members of the so-called &quot;reference 
<br>
class&quot; may not yet exist, or may not exist at all, or may exist or not 
<br>
exist depending on present-day choices.  Why should I extrapolate back to 
<br>
this prior I never had, to this non-naturalistic object, especially if it 
<br>
is ill-defined?  Why not calibrate the pointer state directly?
<br>
<p>Each time you recalibrate the pointer state from scratch, you should 
<br>
arrive at an answer consistent with applying Bayes' Theorem to past actual 
<br>
pointer states - otherwise you haven't been a good rationalist, and the 
<br>
Fairy of Doubt won't bring you any new evidence for Newtonmas.  But this 
<br>
doesn't mean you can extrapolate back before there were any pointer 
<br>
states, by subtracting evidence that already calibrated your pointer state 
<br>
at the moment you booted up, to get a &quot;pre-boot-up&quot; pointer state.  Not 
<br>
surprisingly, such &quot;What were your priors before you were born?&quot; questions 
<br>
are often ill-defined, and so they often give ill-defined answers.  Asking 
<br>
whether pointer state recalibrations obey Bayes' Theorem when they are 
<br>
extrapolated backward in time to before my birth strikes me as an 
<br>
unnaturalistic thing to do.  Should I really give a hoot whether I was a 
<br>
good Bayesian before I actually existed?  Yes, if you give a 
<br>
*well-defined* reference class of &quot;pointer states that don't point to 
<br>
anything yet&quot;, you will get the Self-Indication Assumption on that 
<br>
reference class, followed by the Doomsday Argument to whatever your 
<br>
pointer state actually says.  But so what?
