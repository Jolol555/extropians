<br>
<p>(I have missed practically all the posts recently, but this one
<br>
came to my attention by chance just now)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; The attacks are baseless slander.  They are based on these people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; not jumping on the bandwagon to support the war and the president.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Any liberal, democratic or peaceful position is being lumped in as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; being anti-American.  This is incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; But doesn't it all depend on how you conceive of what your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; proper duties are as a citizen?  Is it not also highly parameterized
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; by circumstances?  I'm sure that you can think of many historical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; situations (or simulations) in which sufficient danger would exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or in which sufficient fealty would be the norm, that it would be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; true that &quot;if you are not with us, then you are against us&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No.  It is baseless slander to accuse people of supporting persons and groups 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no evidence, except trumped up questionable reading into statements 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or absence of same, that there is any such support.
</em><br>
<p>Right.  What you literally write here is absolutely correct.
<br>
The particular question concerned the charge (against an
<br>
American) of being &quot;anti-American&quot;.  It is an exaggeration
<br>
to say that this is necessarily slanderous.  It will depend
<br>
on what &quot;anti-American&quot; means: for example, it may mean those
<br>
who are always against American foreign policy.  Still, I
<br>
totally agree that such a charge, if not expressed as a possibility
<br>
or phrased as a question, could turn out to be not only wrong,
<br>
but insulting and inflammatory.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I readily understand that you cannot take insults lying down,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and that you need to defend what &quot;anti-American&quot; would mean to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you (not that you and others have neglected this).  I myself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; doubt the utility or the wisdom of such provocations---yet if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you could (and I don't know---perhaps you've tried) get those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; people to explain more concretely what they mean when they use
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; such terms, perhaps the disagreements would be loftier.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why is the burden of effort on those who are the victims of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slander?  The slander itself is against the principles of this list.
</em><br>
<p>Because, Samantha, it cannot be so easily established that it
<br>
*is* slander!  In fact the charge of slander fits into this
<br>
very same category: if it is not expressed as a possibility
<br>
or phrased as a question, then it itself may turn out to be
<br>
wrong, or at least insulting and inflammatory.
<br>
<p>You can't *automatically* declare something to be slander
<br>
and thus make it so!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; These are our friends being accused of war crimes.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; excessive.  What is going on here?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; What is going on is differing conceptions of what a country
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or a nation should be, and the proper amount of allegiance
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that is due.  ;-) Your cries of &quot;slander&quot; are just as much an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; overreaction as theirs of &quot;war-criminal&quot;, or &quot;traitor&quot;, though
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps they did start it.  Sorry to keep beating on my theme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; here, but it's the underlying assumptions that need to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; argued about, not the surface phenomena.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, I do not believe that is what is going on.  Actually real
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slander is being done and the quotes are misplaced.  [To] Point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out that it is slander to call any of us a &quot;war criminal&quot; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so on is not in the least on the same level as using those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms against those who oppose some of this country's recent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actions.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;War criminal?&quot;  I'm sorry, but do you have a reference of someone
<br>
on this list being called a &quot;war criminal&quot;?  I can't find one.
<br>
<p>Anyway, you are absolutely right that to call someone a war criminal
<br>
would qualify as slanderous because the meaning is so concrete, and
<br>
cannot be dismissed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this country it is also not a matter of debate whether simply 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagreeing with the actions of the government and saying so makes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one anti_US or unpatriotic much less a &quot;traitor&quot;.  The freedom to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do so is one of the defining principles of this country.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.  But in time of war (as in March), the specific meaning
<br>
of traitor (&quot;giving aid and comfort to a nation's enemy&quot;, see the
<br>
definition of &quot;treason&quot;) makes this less clear.
<br>
<p>The solution is to avoid charging people with this or that.  Because
<br>
there will always be counter-charges.
<br>
<p>Lee
