<em>&gt; Harvey?  Like, over here, bud.
</em><br>
<p>In my non-VR posts, I did mention that there were some exceptions on this
<br>
list.  You are one of them.
<br>
<p>I need to find time to work my way through all your publications.  I have
<br>
big plans to extrapolate security processes to future technologies.  Besides
<br>
the obvious confidentiality, loss-prevention, and keeping bad guys out,
<br>
security encompasses concepts like integrity, availability, reliability,
<br>
trust, recoverability, safety, predictability, performance,
<br>
understandability, accountability, auditability, accessibility, etc.  It
<br>
very well may be that &quot;friendliness&quot; is one of the aspects of technology
<br>
that need to be engineered along with all these other factors.  I would love
<br>
to investigate this to see how well your &quot;friendliness&quot; meshes with various
<br>
other controlling aspects of technology.
<br>
<p>Unfortunately, I now have more time but less money than a couple of years
<br>
ago.
<br>
<p>I have been contacted privately by a number of individuals working on secret
<br>
little projects that could use a little security advice.  I now have no
<br>
doubt that a lot of things are happening with various individuals.  They
<br>
just aren't obvious on this list.  (Why is that?)  I am currently
<br>
brainstorming ways to tie my favorite career of security professional into
<br>
future technology on a more proactive basis.  I have already worked with
<br>
many of our groups on incident response or with some ad-hoc advice.  I would
<br>
like to make some more substantial contributions on a more regular basis.
<br>
<p>My definition of security is &quot;control&quot;.  Not in the sense of blocking people
<br>
or information, but in the sense of making things do what you want.
<br>
Steering a space-ship reliability, testing a new drug safely, making a
<br>
computer not crash, making networks robust, building an AI that won't
<br>
enslave us, making a banking system that protects privacy, making government
<br>
systems that don't exploit people, designing a communication system clearer
<br>
than text e-mail, making a telescope see better, making wearable easier to
<br>
use, making death recoverable, avoiding natural disasters, spellchecking my
<br>
e-mail before I send it, all fall under my ideas about security.  (If
<br>
anybody has a better word for this all-encompassing view of security, I
<br>
would love to hear it.  &quot;Usability&quot; is the least-awkward term I can think of
<br>
right now.)
<br>
<p>Anyway, I haven't overlooked SIAI.  I just haven't gotten to you yet....
