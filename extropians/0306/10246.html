<em>&gt;&gt; I have marked patriotism and loyalty as &quot;considered harmful&quot; since
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; before the age of sixteen.  I have seen nothing within the recent
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; debacle on the Extropian mailing list that leads me to reconsider
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; this.  &quot;Patriotism switches on, brain switches off&quot; appears to be the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; rule.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Surely that's an exaggeration!
</em><br>
<p>Only slightly.  To the extent that patriotism switches on, the brain
<br>
switches off.  To the extent that the brain stays on, it's because
<br>
patriotism is being kept on a leash.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Many extremely thoughtful and calmly, deliberately rational people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; partly extend the notion of self to cover larger groups, and this often
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manifests as loyalty and, on the level of nations, patriotism.
</em><br>
<p>You're the only aspiring rationalist I know of who seems to think that
<br>
patriotism should be acceptable.  But then you are an interestingly
<br>
strange person in many ways.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Now you can readily see the evolutionary sources of such conduct; so I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; infer that the above is a personal statement. You might say if there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are other groups, possibly a family, possibly a group of friends or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; associates, that you have such regard for.  It's not entirely a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of rationality:  notice how you react when a statement is made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; concerning your own integrity or past wisdom on some matters close to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your heart. I doubt that you wish to claim that you always remain an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective observer when personal matters are concerned.
</em><br>
<p>I try.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; I shall side with the right whether it be this country or another. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Patriotism cannot help, can only hinder, in computing this.  If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; America is right then America is right whether I had been born 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; American or French.  If America is wrong then America is wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; whether I had been born British or Iraqi.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, I think that's right.  But this doesn't cut as close to the issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it could in my opinion.  Namely, you won't find anyone here arguing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that America is right if they think that America is wrong.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't truly know what it's like to have loyalty to a group, I'm hardly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; going to be able to explain it to you.  (You may indeed be an extreme
</em><br>
<em>&gt; case.)
</em><br>
<p>I know exactly what it is like.  That's *why* I consider it harmful. 
<br>
Patriotism skews people's ability to analyze which side, if any, is in the 
<br>
right.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have seen people who are otherwise not engaged with any group exhibit
</em><br>
<em>&gt; loyalty to &quot;the Extropians&quot;.  All people, I think, are wired at a level
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immune from memes to have a team to root for (just think of teenagers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and their peer group or sports fans and their favorite teams)---it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just a matter of degree.  Again, it's important to realize that this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did not occur by chance in the evolutionary heritage of the human race;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it has had survival value.
</em><br>
<p>In a 200-person hunter-gatherer tribe, it had personal reproductive value. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not necessarily survival value.  Not necessarily today.  And not 
<br>
necessarily value relative to my goals.
