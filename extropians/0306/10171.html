</em><br>
<p>They could start by letting states negotiate group rates for
<br>
prescription drugs for their residents. As it is, more and more people
<br>
are ordering their prescription drugs out of the country over the
<br>
internet.
<br>
<p>Me: basically :)
<br>
<p>Keep in mind also, the Columbian cartels and the guerrilla groups that
<br>
have many billions of dollars in the bank seem to be dumping the dollar
<br>
as a tactic of financial combat against the backer of their enemy. This
<br>
is becoming a pig pile tactic by many countries which import more from
<br>
the US than they export and don't like our &quot;we're not a punching bag
<br>
anymore&quot; foreign policy.
<br>
<p>Me: I pretty much attribute the drug war to a way to keep interest rates
<br>
higher, and of course, establish the greenback as a world-wide currency.
<br>
<p>Keep in mind that deflation is not the same thing as devaluation.
<br>
<p>Me: Fair enough; I don't really differentiate because in my mind, the
<br>
two are fundamentally linked.  Short-term effects though, do require
<br>
descriptive differentiation...
<br>
<p>Deflation is when prices decrease (normally occurs when the value of the
<br>
dollar increases), while devaluation is when the dollar is worth less of
<br>
competetive currencies. Most of the deflationary pressure is from
<br>
falling energy prices (and prices that are impacted by energy prices).
<br>
Since energy prices were previously inflated solely due to war jitters,
<br>
this should not, IMHO, be considered a bad thing, and the deflation is
<br>
not a sign of anything systemically wrong with the economy.
<br>
<p>The dollar, somewhat contradictorily, is also devaluing, mostly because
<br>
many countries pissed at our foreign policy are changing how their own
<br>
currencies are anchored, from a dollar standard to a euro standard. This
<br>
also IMHO is actually a paper tiger that is more likely to help us than
<br>
hurt us. It gives the French the false prestige they crave, while at the
<br>
same time inflating the prices of their exports, which will negatively
<br>
impact their economy.
<br>
<p>Me: Agreed regarding the devaluation of the dollar (since it is in my
<br>
opinion, pumped up artificially).
<br>
<p>With decreased demand for dollars overseas, this makes our money cheap
<br>
internationally while at the same time paradoxically of high value
<br>
domestically. 
<br>
<p>Me: cute, I didn't make this connection :)  You're basically saying that
<br>
more money will flood in to our country, at the same time the foreign
<br>
imports go up in price...
<br>
similarly, inflation will rise for domestic goods because there will be
<br>
more money floating around, unless of course, the fed raises interest
<br>
rates or reserve requirements...
<br>
<p>This can only be a good thing for the US, and will result in a return of
<br>
many manufacturing jobs to the US, especially skilled blue collar jobs.
<br>
Imports will decrease and exports will increase. The trade deficit, an
<br>
artifact of our currency being the lingua franca of international
<br>
finance, will fade from view and might even become a trade surplus. I
<br>
predict that within a decade the US economy will resemble Japan of the
<br>
70s and 80's. Consumer savings will skyrocket. A speculative bubble of a
<br>
size never before seen will occur across the entire economy, which will
<br>
last as long as people are confident that they are making rational
<br>
decisions (and so long as the facts they are basing those decisions on
<br>
remain accurate).
<br>
<p>Me: sadly, I'm just starting out in my fiscal historical analysis :) I
<br>
don't have many years of experience watching the markets on the like;
<br>
I can't comment...
<br>
<p>So, out of curiousity, what do you think about the housing market? I
<br>
think its going to tank bigtime, but my father is of the opposite
<br>
opinion..
<br>
My reasoning is that fundamentally, it doesn't matter how low the market
<br>
rates go, if people are unemployed and getting laid off.  I personally
<br>
don't think he (Bush) is going to be able to create enough jobs... I'm
<br>
predicting there's going to be a wave of foreclosures coming within the
<br>
next
<br>
2-3 years...  Especially given that the housing market is way
<br>
overpriced, and anybody who still has savings is dumping it into their
<br>
house for equity because
<br>
the stock market is so flat, and the bond market's return is so
<br>
neglible... My father is banking on the election year theory
<br>
(self-explanatory).
<br>
<p>What's your opinion?
<br>
omard-out
<br>
<p>PS&gt; if you could send me a CC to my email account, I'ld be entirely in
<br>
your debt; 
<br>
I won't be monitering this list-serv come tomorrow Sunday for quite some
<br>
time...
<br>
<p>danke :)
