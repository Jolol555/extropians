<em>&gt; This seems to suggest a discrete split in our futures.  Either agents,

</em><br>
<em>&gt; hard to see but beliefs are not, so that agents self-deceive.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To see that there really is a demand for such self-deception, let's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; work through an example.  Let us say I know how much I really like my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girlfriend (x), and then I choose my new beliefs (y), under the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expectation that my girlfriend will then see those new beliefs, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not any memory of this revision process.  (Of course it wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really like this; analyzing this is a simple way to see the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tradeoffs.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I face a tradeoff.  The more confident I become I like her the worse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my future decisions will be (due to the difference y-x), but the more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; she will be reassured of my loyalty (due to a high y).  The higher my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; x, the higher a y I'm willing to choose in making this tradeoff.  So
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the higher a y she sees, the higher an x she can infer.  So this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all really costly signaling.
</em><br>
<p>### At this point, the terms signaling and self-deception are perhaps no
<br>
longer quite appropriate. The signal you send and the referent of value to
<br>
your girlfriend are one and the same. Word and deed is one, which is
<br>
different from the usual context of signaling.
<br>
<p>As in many other cases, sci-fi literature already considered the scenario
<br>
you mention - Philip Dick's &quot;Total Recall&quot; describes a state agent who
<br>
erases his memories to gain access to a rebel group (whose leader is a
<br>
mind-reader), and loses his individuality. One could leave the old goal
<br>
system hidden within the mind as a viral entity, ready to reassert itself
<br>
over the decoy's personality at some predetermined time, but this is pure
<br>
theorizing now - we probably know too little about mind structures to
<br>
predict if successful use of such hidden layers would be easy or difficult.
<br>
<p>It might be useful to restrict the term self-deception to situations where
<br>
an unfulfilled need stemming from one part of a goal system leads to the
<br>
formulation of a belief and a secondary goal, which is in conflict with the
<br>
initial goal. It serves to conceal the initial goal from observers and, to a
<br>
lesser extent, from self (the rest of the goal system). So a desire for
<br>
inclusion in a coalition for selfish reasons will induce acceptance of the
<br>
coalition's goals and their zealous pursuit, marred by a partially conscious
<br>
conflict between the goals. This is self-deception. Sometimes the secondary
<br>
goals can overwrite the initial goal system totally, and this where self
<br>
*deception* does not apply any longer - the absolutely committed soldier is
<br>
no longer deceiving himself about his goals. He has new ones. I also feel
<br>
that terminological clarity would be served by differentiating the above
<br>
from deviations from rationality which never enter the conscious mind, and
<br>
are due to deep conflicts in the goal system, or inborn habits of thought
<br>
which are not critically evaluated by the individual, a lack of insight
<br>
rather than intellectual honesty.
