</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personal clarification:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not an extropian.
</em><br>
<p>Then what are you doing here?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am not, therefore, on Extropy's board, but I certainly don't find the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethics of those who are `twisted'. If I did, I'd get my cut-price drinks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; elsewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Must one be on Extropy's board to call themselves an extropian?  If that is
<br>
the case, perhaps the extropian board should define some of thier ethical
<br>
principles.  Or is an extropian different to each person, but having a
<br>
definition tending to share such common values as using technology to better
<br>
human lives (at least their own life)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If you feel `deep visceral disgust to an extropian's concept of ethics',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what are you doing here? (Just wondering.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>I was referring to your ethics and previously to Emlyn's ethics, or at least
<br>
the statement you have made that hinted toward your ethical principles.  I
<br>
have not found these particular ethical concepts of 'it is more immoral the
<br>
more it effects me' and 'removing a murderous tyrant is morally as bad as
<br>
being a murderous tyrant' prevelant on this board, however I have found
<br>
seemingly questionable ethical principles more prevalent than reasonable
<br>
ones.  I may be mistaken, and would invite extropians to present their
<br>
ethical foundations.
<br>
<p>Many of the members I have conversed with off list and on actually seem to
<br>
acknowledge that murderous oppresive regimes are bad, and indeed more bad
<br>
than 'regimes' that imprison members of its population in relatively
<br>
comfortable prisons for victimless actions, such as smoking pot.
<br>
<p>However, some do not, some suggest that the good guys won in vietnam (much
<br>
to of the dismay of the millions of enslaved and murdered indochinese
<br>
people) Some actively supported the abandonment of said persons, and still
<br>
feel such abandonment as just, some others suggest the US is immorral for
<br>
killing Iraqi civilians in a war to remove a murderous dictator, but scoff
<br>
at the immorrality of leaving impoverished and enslaved people to suffer and
<br>
die, more of the 'if it doesnt bother me, its not immorral' system of ethics
<br>
you seem to endorse.
<br>
<p>However, I point out, you did not specify your moral position on such a
<br>
question, as I previously asked you and you did not include an answer in
<br>
your response.  I shall ask again
<br>
<p>Damien said:
<br>
<em>&gt; When I hear that Saddam and his sons and regime tortured and murdered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, I am horrified; when I hear that US jails contain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prisoners many of them incarcerated for using marijuana and subjected in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prison to rampant rape and brutality, I am horrified as well.
</em><br>
<p>...but are you equally horrified? !!!!!!!!
<br>
<p>Are you seriously suggesting it is equally deplorable that humans beings are
<br>
being raped, murdered, and tortured as you find human beings spending a few
<br>
months in climate controlled prison watching survivor, weight lifting and
<br>
reading Playboy in a post industrialized west nation living longer healther
<br>
better lives than perhaps 3/4's of the world?
<br>
<p>So, which is it, is it more wrong to rape and murder someone (albiet,
<br>
someone you dont know) or more wrong to toss a pot smoking youth in jail?
<br>
<p>Accordingly, which are you morally required to voice objections to?  The one
<br>
you have more control over, or the one that is more wrong (if, indeed, you
<br>
feel one is actually more wrong than the other)
<br>
<p>Further, is Saddam Hussain morally culpable for the deaths of the civilians
<br>
in the Coalition lead effort to remove said murderous tyrant from power, or
<br>
is the coalition morally culpable?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
