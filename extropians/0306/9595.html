</em><br>
<p>I agree. But be careful lest you labeled as one of those who &quot;Blame America
<br>
First.&quot; 
<br>
<p>Osama bin Laden made his grievances known many years ago, at the time that
<br>
he first called for the Holy Jihad that led to 9/11 and which is still in
<br>
effect in the minds of Islamic extremists. He even put his reasons in
<br>
writing for all the world to read and consider. I recall reading that letter
<br>
by bin Laden on the internet somewhere, though at the moment I wouldn't know
<br>
where to find it.
<br>
<p>Despite his sinister nature, it is clear from his writings that Osama bin
<br>
Laden is actually an intelligent and educated man who knows his motivations
<br>
well. And contrary to popular belief, he and his followers and successors
<br>
are not motivated by some kind of jealous envy of the western life-style or
<br>
hatred of western values. Bin Laden stated his reasons for Jihad quite
<br>
clearly: the Jihad is driven by the belief that we Americans are desecrating
<br>
holy Muslim land through our support of Israel and through our military
<br>
presence in Saudi Arabia. Now they have no doubt added our presence in Iraq
<br>
as an additional reason for Jihad. 
<br>
<p>This is to say that Islamic terrorists are not merely deranged whackos who
<br>
kill themselves in suicide bombings because of some intense psychotic hatred
<br>
of western values. That western view of Islamic terrorism is, I think, very
<br>
naïve but politically convenient. 
<br>
<p>The Islamic terrorist believes himself to be a noble and dedicated soldier
<br>
fighting a Holy War to defend the Islamic world against the invasion of
<br>
Zionists and western imperialists. Whether he is right or wrong in his
<br>
perspective is not the point. It is the mind of the enemy.
