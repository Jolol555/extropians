<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;The nation's leading environmental groups can barely control their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enthusiasm. ''We're bullish on wind,'' says Kert Davies, research
</em><br>
<em>&gt; director of Greenpeace USA. ''Everybody has to ante up in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fight.''
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ... 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, this is a new day.  I and the director of Greenpeace agree on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Robert had an objection that I kinda punted: that his detroit doesn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; run on electricity.  My notion is that a transition would be gradual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough that major pain would be averted.
</em><br>
<p>A fuel cell car burning natural gas is actually more efficient than a
<br>
wind generator generating H2, since the electrolysis has its own losses
<br>
that dip H2 + O efficiency below that of light fossil fuels.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So now I ask, if the current low interest rates hold and wind power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keeps going in at the current rate (they are building them like 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hell out here), we know who the winners are.  But who loses?  
</em><br>
<p>Given that renewable energy sources are HIGHLY dependent on
<br>
construction with very low interest capital, its obvious that fossil
<br>
fuel generators will thereafter be at a competetive disadvantage to
<br>
those finished before interest goes back up.
<br>
<p>Nuclear power similarly depends upon low interest capital, so it
<br>
doesn't lose, except that too many people do not view it as a green
<br>
technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I want to ignore for the time being those who hold stock in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatives.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Someone mentioned climate change downwind of the windmills.  What is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that?  I haven't heard of anything like that, altho it stands to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason if we are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extracting energy from the wind, the entropy of the wind must somehow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increase.  Anyone know?  
</em><br>
<p>Reducing wind velocity downwind of turbines reduces water evaporation,
<br>
but the turbines also increase the 'height' (so far as the wind is
<br>
concerned) of whatever ground they are on, which would cause a slight
<br>
increase in precipitation up wind of the generators, which would
<br>
obviously reduce precipitation downwind.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Some have said that a hilltop covered with windmills is unsightly,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but I beg to differ.  I find them very sightly.  On a windy day when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are all spinning like hell, generating all that power and all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that beautiful money, they are quite scenic. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK, so I know who wins, but who loses (besides the bird fans and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pilots) if we start poking windmills into the ground like weeds?
</em><br>
<p>Here in the Northeast, opposition to cellphone towers has reached fever
<br>
pitch in many areas populated by retired yuppies whose primary concern
<br>
is their own property value and consider the view from their land to
<br>
belong to them. Similar opposition exists to radio towers and
<br>
windmills. Note how Ted Kennedy and John Kerry, normally proponents of
<br>
alternative energy, are opposed to the Cape Cod wind project because it
<br>
would sit of the coast of their own oceanfront estates.
<br>
<p>The only way to resolve this is to come up with some sort of court
<br>
ruling that property owners do not and cannot 'own' the view from their
<br>
property, though they may derive value from it which they have not paid
<br>
their neighbors for.
