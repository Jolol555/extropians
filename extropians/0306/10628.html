</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; even a 'tiny kernel', what then?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If there is real evidence, then the attack is not slander.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the individual person instead of the topic.
</em><br>
<p>Begging the question, who determines if the evidence is 'real' ?  You?
<br>
The accusee? The list by popular vote?  A jury?  If, for instance,
<br>
someone was to say of the Indochina wars that 'the good guys won' and,
<br>
in fact, the communists won, would that be 'real' evidence that the
<br>
individual in question considers the 'good guys' to be the communists?
<br>
Rhetorical, as you note you don't want to partake in that particular
<br>
discussion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Further, Harvey, since you have made a good presence at suggesting 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what could be considered to be good conclusion to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable draw from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; others comments, I wonder how you interpret Jeff's statements?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have no interest choosing sides in this political battle at 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same time I am trying to enforce list rules.
</em><br>
<p>Given that it seems you have only enforced list rules when those of
<br>
ideologies you tend to oppose are suspected of breaking them, it seems a
<br>
possible interpretation that you are attempting to force this board to
<br>
be more of a representation of what you think it should be.  A laudable
<br>
goal if you have objective and honest interests.  However, citing your
<br>
comment that the ExI lost funding because of what someone had posted on
<br>
the list and did not like, it seems you have an incentive to push the
<br>
list away from things you think others may not like.  
<br>
<p>If I had been ready to toss some money to the ExI, and I saw someone
<br>
post 'The good guys won' about Vietnam, and saw no critical response to
<br>
that, I probably would be hesitant to contribute.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Since this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; revelation on Jeff's part sparked no comments, then perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I inferred 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; completely incorrectly and every other extropian out there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is thinking 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 'That's not what Jeff was saying, idiot!'  Or, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; alternatively, perhaps 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; no one founds Jeff's comments startling at all, even though 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they found 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; my interpretation correct (or not).  Or, third, perhaps no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one saw the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; post, as I am no doubt the member of many kill files.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, fourth, the whole point of focusing on Jeff is off-topic 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and uninteresting to most readers.  
</em><br>
<p>Possible of course, or also they simply don't care that someone
<br>
considers a system of govt that has killed more than 170 million people
<br>
*this century* as the 'good guys'  No doubt the lack of responses is a
<br>
combination of these various options, however considering there only
<br>
seems to be a handful of people on this list who are openly critical of
<br>
communist governments, and a number who are critical of those people's
<br>
anti-communist stances, I am forced to wonder how much of a role each of
<br>
those plays in the silence.
<br>
<p>Maybe people want to read 
<br>
<em>&gt; about perpetual progress, self-transformation, practical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; optimism, intelligent technology, open society, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-direction or rational thinking, and don't care whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you can prove anything specific about this particular list 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; member or not.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Indeed people should want to read about those things, and conversely I
<br>
should hope they would be interested in condemning the opposition of
<br>
those things.  All of those things are the exact OPPOSITE of any
<br>
communist government this world has ever seen.  Which is the exact
<br>
reason why someone claiming to be a communist, or suggesting communists
<br>
are good guys, or claiming communist governments are legit SHOULD CAUSE
<br>
concern amongst a list devoted to progress, self-transformation,
<br>
optimism, *open societies* Etc, etc...  As it is also the exact reason
<br>
why Eliezer suggested it would be unreasonable to find someone on this
<br>
list who is supportive of an oppressive stagnating immoral state.
<br>
However, there is someone on this list who makes statements indicating
<br>
support, legitimacy, or what have you of just such an extreme
<br>
non-extropian state.  
<br>
<p>Begging the question, how can these two diametrically opposed viewpoints
<br>
be resolved?  Perhaps Jeff is referring only to an abstract morally
<br>
valid communist state, in which a platonic ruling elite preside over the
<br>
people and control the economy, but the people are bound to such a
<br>
system of their own free will *and* can choose to remove themselves from
<br>
participation in said system.  I can only fathom.  Or perhaps he is a
<br>
lurker spy from the workers world party?  The later of which I doubt.
<br>
Since Jeff is uninterested in posting anything other than transcripts
<br>
from his latest discussions with Fido on the subject, I can only attempt
<br>
to resolve this from my own inquiry.  And since I am of a small minority
<br>
that seemed to be concerned that an extropian would espouse such
<br>
anti-extropian ideas I am left to investigate the question on my own.
<br>
My archive digging is in process.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Even if you do prove something?  So what?  Let's say we hold 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a star-chamber online and find Jeff guilty in absentia.  You 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; present your evidence and we all vote 100% unanimously that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we find Jeff guilty of harboring supportive thoughts about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam Hussein and/or communism.  So what do we do next? 
</em><br>
<p>Well first of all you stop calling my comments ad hominem, especially
<br>
when you do not even consider the weight of the evidence but
<br>
automatically assume I am making a personal attack.  As you noted, if
<br>
the evidence is 'true' then it is not a personal attack.  It is, in
<br>
fact, an objective observation.  I note in your offlist communication
<br>
with me, you specifically cite my posting of what you called &quot;evidence&quot;
<br>
(with quotes) that Jeff is a communist as an ad hominem, or at least as
<br>
an example of inappropriate behavior.  If the posting of evidence is an
<br>
ad hominem, but evidence is required to determine if someone's comments
<br>
are ad hominem, what do to?  It seems difficult to carry on discussions
<br>
at all if you are not able to post evidence supporting your statements.
<br>
<p><p>Second, we should sit back and asks ourselves why a person who considers
<br>
oppressive murderous stagnating regimes to be 'good guys' (paraphrasing)
<br>
could be attracted to this list, which is based on the exact opposite of
<br>
nearly everything that communist governments represent.  The presence of
<br>
this ideology should cause concern, or *at least* spur further
<br>
investigation into the apparent conflicts, unless extropians feel that
<br>
communist governments are in fact compatible with extropianism (again,
<br>
perhaps some abstract morally valid communist state could possibly be,
<br>
but no such state has ever existed, and is certainly not in existence in
<br>
Vietnam) then such comments should at least spark some interest, as
<br>
there is virtually nothing more anti-extropic than the communist
<br>
governments the world has seen.
<br>
<p>Move 
<br>
<em>&gt; the trial into the sentencing phase?  What exactly is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end-game to this process you are pursuing?
</em><br>
<p>Open discussion, and self analysis, and working toward identifying what
<br>
extropians might value, and seeking the truth, working toward extropic
<br>
goals, etc. etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; However, in attempting to do this, If I should point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that (for example) Jeff's arguments are in support of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communism, am I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not directly implying that he is also, since he is the one making 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; those arguments?  Thusly, I could be accused of an ad hominem, even 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; though I am attacking the argument, and not the arguer.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not at all.  Even in your own question, you attribute the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implications correctly &quot;since he is the one making those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments&quot;.  No one should accuse you of ad hominem if you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack the argument and not the arguer. That is the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definition of avoiding ad hominem.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>You are absolutely correct, in a perfect world.  But I think you are
<br>
being too literal.  If someone says A = B, then says B = C, and I
<br>
suggest then that they are saying A = C, it is absurd to not think I
<br>
would be implying that that some actually suggests A = C.  If that
<br>
person makes the statement of A = B and B = C in a manner that suggest
<br>
he believes both of those statements to be true, then my pointing out
<br>
that A = C would necessarily imply that he also *believes* A = C.  The
<br>
true and complete separation of arguer from arguments is not going to
<br>
happen, clearly every one can tell a good deal about my ideologies from
<br>
what I argue, and unless this list is rife with people arguing for
<br>
things that are not in their own ideology (which I am sure happens
<br>
sometimes) then the arguments they make can in most cases (unless
<br>
evidence arises suggesting otherwise) can be assumed to be a reflection
<br>
of their ideologies.  In that context, unless both parties start from
<br>
the onset by clearly stating that this may not necessarily be what they
<br>
endorse, then ad hominem is ALWAYS present by implication by merely
<br>
asserting the opponents holds opposing opinions!
<br>
<p>However, I will no doubt focus only on attacking the arguments, and not
<br>
the arguers, but extropians should be aware that ad hominems are not as
<br>
clear cut and as easy to pick out as one may first think, witness the
<br>
recent long discussion on what exactly constitutes and ad hominem
<br>
attack.
<br>
<p>In this case, someone says 'The good guys won in Vietnam'.  I note then
<br>
that since the communists won in Vietnam (perhaps he would take issue
<br>
with that, that they were communists) then he is suggesting that the
<br>
communists are the good guys.
<br>
<p>To be clear, my paraphrasing of 'the good guys won' is not 100%
<br>
accurate.
<br>
<p>The actual statement can be found here:
<br>
<p><a href="http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::Y0NjMwdx-YHAW-Whs2-BiF7-Kk">http://forum.javien.com/XMLmessage.php?id=id::Y0NjMwdx-YHAW-Whs2-BiF7-Kk</a>

<br>
<p>And reads:
<br>
<p>&quot;Hell!, my side--the right side--prevailed--though at horrific
<br>
cost--back when it was the central event of my generation.  Hooray!
<br>
Having taken my victory lap, it is now time for me to get on with
<br>
looking to the future.&quot;
<br>
<p>The people of Vietnam probably share no great optimism about the future,
<br>
as they are less free today than they were before the Vietnam war.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Harvey, I would be interested in seeing some examples if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; readily available, especially if you feel I am guilty of any of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behavior you mention as I was recently informed that there 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have been 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; complaints about my posts.  Though no specifics were provided, I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; always up for self-improvement.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot imagine that this will do any good, and will only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lead us into further debate over minutia.  But since it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only fair, I will send you some examples off-line.  However, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; please realize that these few examples of people being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accused of having enemy ties are just a very small part of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the larger ad hominem problem which violates list rules.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also note that the specific examples of the past are not as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important as how we are going to deal with them in the future.
</em><br>
<p>Noted, and an important distinction to make
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Seriously, I can't find any of these examples directed by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; name against an individual.  I seem to find these 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; occurrences, but they are generic discussions about topics 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not people.  For example, Eliezer's discussion about 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patriotism contains those specific phrases.  He did not call 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any person any names, mention any specific list members, nor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; could they seem to be applied to the person he was debating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at the time (Lee Corbin).  These references seem to be part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of a rational discussion about the topic without accusing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each other or anybody else.  I can only speculate why you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed that these descriptions applied to the particular 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people you mention.  I think you are having difficulty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distinguishing between an attack on the argument and an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attack on the person.  Eliezer and others do not seem guilty 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the ad hominem, nor do I find any searching for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; phrases you suggested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I note that as good as you have been a pointing out 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dishonest debating 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I don't recall you ever criticizing statements like the ones above 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; directed toward people who have a generally different ideology.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; also never once saw you criticize Humania for making such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comments to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; me as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am not perfect.  I simply don't have time nor the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; omniscience to catch every possible case that should receive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my comment.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, however, if you were to assert only Ron, MaxPLumm, myself,
<br>
John Clark, etc. and those who share similar political stances are the
<br>
only ones making for bad debating, I think you should be considered
<br>
dishonest.  We are all humans and we all have faults, I would like the
<br>
list to note that just because you don't have the time to point out any
<br>
inappropriate behavior by members who profess political ideologies that
<br>
tend toward opposition of the people listed above, does not imply that
<br>
they commit no inappropriate behavior, fair enough?
<br>
<p>Further, I am surprised at your responses to my pointing to Humania's
<br>
comments.
<br>
<p>--&lt;snip most of humania's comments.&gt;--
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Bombing for peace is like fucking for virginity.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;I will not stop shouting, I am against THIS war. You are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deadly wrong 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and you should hear it again every day!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Do *any* of these statements belong on this list?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure you understand what ad hominem is or exactly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the list rules prohibit.  
</em><br>
<p>Note I did not say that these were all ad hominems, I asked if these
<br>
statements belong on this list.  While the adamant ad hominems you
<br>
police do not belong, these statements, along with Jeffs lengthy
<br>
paragraph of dog barking, certainly do not belong on this list.  I have
<br>
asked Humania repeatedly to cease posting blanket accusations,
<br>
characterizations and hand waving emotional outbursts, and try to post
<br>
specific comment or ideas.  Vague ambiguous emotional comments like this
<br>
do as much to harm the political image of ExI as any 10 questionable ad
<br>
Hominems do, unless of course the above comments happen to coincide with
<br>
the ideology of the person perusing, or judging, the list.  Do you agree
<br>
that outbursts like this, and Jeff's barking dog transcript probably
<br>
should not be posted?
<br>
<p>Note, I am not advocating the implementation of any new list rules,
<br>
merely pointing to something that list members could hopefully use as a
<br>
personal posting guideline, if you do not have a productive comment to
<br>
make, please try not to post.
<br>
<p>None of these seem to be 
<br>
<em>&gt; obvious personal attacks on specific list members.  Many of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; these are obviously directed at public figures, whole 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political parties, or specific points of view.  Although the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; word &quot;you&quot; is ambiguous and would need to be quoted in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; context, I don't see anything here that remotely is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comparable to the kind of personal accusations of specific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political activities or associations that I complained about. 
</em><br>
<p>I disagree, the use of 'You(plural)' could just as easily be interpreted
<br>
as a blanket ad hominem.
<br>
<p>E.g.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &quot;You (plural; the patriots here) twist around the words of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; opponents&quot;
</em><br>
<p>i.e. Everyone whom I consider to be a patriot intentionally alters the
<br>
words of opponents (i.e. is dishonest, is a liar)
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Instead of being attacks on individuals, these seem to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attacks on particular political beliefs, which is not against 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rules.
</em><br>
<p>Or, just as easily, they could be considered attacks on groups of
<br>
individuals, and rightly do not belong on the list.  Had I said 
<br>
<p>&quot;You(plural) war opposers are supporters of Saddam's regime&quot;  No doubt
<br>
all hell would be raised, with each individual war opposer reasonably
<br>
assuming I was accusing each and every one of them of supporting
<br>
Saddam's regime.  But when an opposite statement is made (and many
<br>
similar ones) it slips by without attention.  
<br>
<p>In conclusion, I appeal to everyone on the list to refrain from obvious
<br>
ad hominems (which I don't think we see very often) but also not to be
<br>
so quick to judge any disagreement or critic of ones ideas as an ad
<br>
hominem.  Additionally, I hope posters make an effort (as I will) to
<br>
only post productive contributions to conversations.
