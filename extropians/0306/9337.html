<em>&gt; It would seem that media coverage of Big Business,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; American Style has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; obliterated memories of how most businesses here
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to be built, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how they often still are in the 3rd world.  How
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about just a bunch of
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; first run
</em><br>
<em>&gt; operational expenses and buying into a ship that can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; carry cargo
</em><br>
<em>&gt; across the ocean?
</em><br>
<p>Businesses of the past did not have to compete with
<br>
modern, more efficient shipping.  And at least my own
<br>
experience with 3rd world industries is that they
<br>
exist because they can - they don't have to be the
<br>
same people year to year; if one biz tanks, another
<br>
pops up with the same old scheme, having learned
<br>
nothing from its failed predecessors.  (Though,
<br>
sometimes, unable even to be aware of said
<br>
predecessors, given the lack of communications and
<br>
records.)  Same with 3rd world governments.  And when
<br>
they break out of that mindset and start learning,
<br>
well...just look at South Africa, for example.
<br>
<p>Western-style Big Business is known around the world
<br>
in part because such businesses last long enough to
<br>
become known around the world.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, these people would live aboard the ship, many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of them. Maybe they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot afford another home.  Oh, the shame of it! I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have intimiated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that people may exist who are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually--gasp--unrich!
</em><br>
<p>Unrich is sustainable.  Negative income stream is not
<br>
sustainable.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;If the latter,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;container ships do that much better, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;so you'd rapidly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;find yourself outpriced.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Profits would be less, but why would that shut them
</em><br>
<em>&gt; out of business?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They would have no payroll to meet.....
</em><br>
<p>The workers onboard would not want to save for
<br>
retirement?  Or send money to support their
<br>
potentially-just-as-unrich families?  And let's not
<br>
forget food, fuel, and other supplies.  Expenses are
<br>
not zero, and unless you charged high enough rates
<br>
that
<br>
few if any companies would ship with you (why?  What
<br>
advantage would you offer them that justifies even a
<br>
penny more per ton?), you'd probably find these
<br>
expenses eating up profits and then some - even at the
<br>
rates that more optimized cargo shippers, with far
<br>
less
<br>
expenses per ton shipped (and possibly faster shipping
<br>
to boot, which both reduces expenses and raises the
<br>
rates they can charge), can make hefty profits at.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;But the former might be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;viable niche, especially if it was anchored just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;outside US waters (to be able to move inside, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;non-US pirates came a-calling; possibly near the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;border to Canadian waters if said pirates were the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;type the US wouldn't act against).  It'd still be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;carrier of sorts, just that most of its child craft
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;would be watercraft instead of aircraft.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I doubt that an aircraft carrier with 500 men aboard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be at much
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger from pirates.
</em><br>
<p>500 men.  Given as it would be Extropians we're
<br>
talking
<br>
about, let's be generous over normal civilians and
<br>
assume that fully half of them are armed and as
<br>
effective at combat as an average police officer.
<br>
<p>Now put them against 200 or so heavily armed folk
<br>
(they
<br>
know this is a big target; they'll bring friends) who
<br>
regularly train in combat (Marine equivalent - bottom
<br>
of the barrel for US Marines, perhaps, but still
<br>
better
<br>
trained and more aggressive), with long experience in
<br>
boarding and securing ships.
<br>
<p>Perhaps the crew of the Extro 1 could repel the
<br>
boarders, or even turn the tides and capture their
<br>
boats.  I'd assign it less than 50% odds, but more
<br>
than
<br>
10%.  But I think it likely that there would be
<br>
significant loss of life on both sides no matter what.
<br>
Better just to run.
<br>
<p>Of course, the odds go up if the Extro 1 crew invests
<br>
seriously in high-tech weapons that (of the two sides
<br>
in this hypothetical conflict) only they know even
<br>
exist - browse DARPA's &quot;less-than-lethal&quot; projects and
<br>
select your favorite stunner, for instance.  But note
<br>
the price tags - and, as you said, a number of these
<br>
people would be unrich.
