</em><br>
<em>&gt;forget about them, then just let them sink back into our unconscious.

<em>&gt;Ask an average man with an average girlfriend whether he really believes

<em>&gt;his girlfriend is the beautifulest, (in private, of course, and under
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions of trust, etc.) and I think he'll concede that, when he
</em><br>
<em>&gt;considers it carefully, she's not the most beautiful girl *in the world*,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;but, you know, she's _close enough_.  Since it's easy enough not to let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that be a constant factor in your consciousness, it's easy enough to let
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that slide into the background as you engage in close relations.
</em><br>
<p>Perhaps I didn't understand you before.  It sounds now like you are saying
<br>
that while it might look like you are saying untruths, you are actually
<br>
not because you are using an &quot;approximating model&quot;, with the fact that
<br>
your approximation is way off here having conveniently slipped your mind.
<br>
I would call this self-deception and biased reasoning.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;You, on the other hand, seem to be pursuing a distinctly irrational
</em><br>
<em>&gt;strategy at the moment.  I think if you believe what you say, you should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;stop doing so immediately, on its own terms.  All these dismal truths are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;precisely the sort of thing you argue we're supposed to disbelieve for our
</em><br>
<em>&gt;own good, isn't it?
</em><br>
<p>I said that I place a large primary value of believing the truth.  The
<br>
topic here was whether there are any other strong reasons one can offer
<br>
for believing the truth.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I might add that your claim that most people seem to be mostly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;self-deceived about most of what's around them, especially in particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt;areas of discourse, seem vulnerable to (Donald) Davidsonian arguments: I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt;say that we could not say of a society that we understand what they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saying and that they are radically mistaken about most of what they're
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saying.   <a href="http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/">http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/davidson/</a>
</em><br>
<p>I've heard that argument against the possibility of detecting self-deception
<br>
and reject it.  If you read the literature on self-deception it becomes
<br>
clear that it is a real phenomena that we can in fact reliably detect in
<br>
many circumstances.
