<p>It has.  It's been done over and over and over again.
<br>
The problem is the network effect: without a large
<br>
number of users that travel within range of this
<br>
device on a typical day, it has little value.  But
<br>
you don't get said large number of users even in the
<br>
highest-population-density areas until after it
<br>
starts having significant value.  Catch 21, and no
<br>
one has yet been able to solve it - though there have
<br>
been many failed attempts that just wasted everyone's
<br>
time and money.  Indeed, from what I've heard, it was
<br>
not atypical for purchasers of such a device to never
<br>
once encounter anyone else who had a compatible device
<br>
- to say nothing of a compatible profile entered into
<br>
said device - in the months or years between
<br>
purchasing it and ceasing to use it (tossing, leaving
<br>
at home permanently, or whatever).
<br>
<p>The expansion to stores and medical facilities is a
<br>
new twist - but, frankly, you'd have to push that
<br>
aspect of the electronic ID almost exclusively before
<br>
it would be adopted by enough people that the romantic
<br>
connection side would become useful.  And even that
<br>
has similar prior examples (smart cards, for instance)
<br>
where similar network effects come into play (if none
<br>
of the stores I go to support this device, for
<br>
instance, then I get no value from purchasing one).
<br>
<p>In short: find a way to beat the massive downside of
<br>
the network effect, or your attempt to realize this
<br>
idea will fizzle, just like everyone else's
<br>
attempts.(Unfortunately, said downside is so massive
<br>
that you
<br>
might have trouble giving these things away - to
<br>
merchants, medics, and customers - even ignoring
<br>
concerns about how to make a profit without selling
<br>
any devices.)
