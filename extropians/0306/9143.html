<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Aside: It seems to me that the popular fixation on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA seems to be wrong to me. Its DNA *interacting*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with proteins which do almost everything that matters
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in biology. DNA of itself is almost completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uninteresting. The same DNA is in every cell 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; type. Yet what makes different cell types and this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; applies all the way back to the fertilized egg which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contains a cocktail of proteins is the way the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteins interact with the DNA and selectively turn 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain genes off and on in turn creating other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proteins in the mix both in type and in number. If we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; knew all the proteins in the maternal oocyte, both
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number and type, that would be powerful knowledge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indeed, because these early proteins are crucial to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; early development and they do not come from the DNA of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fertilized egg or new individual but from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mother. At this point we don't know what these are). 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, there is a kind of meta-DNA cellular memory?  With
</em><br>
<em>&gt; error checking, one might presume?  And the ability to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; respond to changes?  Can we come up with an overall
</em><br>
<em>&gt; description or characterization of this meta-system?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure about &quot;memory&quot; (as you seem to be using the 
<br>
word), but there does need to be *some* proteins in the cell
<br>
to work on the DNA (before the DNA has had a chance to
<br>
&nbsp;produce anything) and to determine what other proteins 
<br>
should be produced and when. 
<br>
<p>In IVF (some types not standard) there is a technique called 
<br>
cytoplasmic transfer where some of the cytoplasm from the 
<br>
oocytes of a young women (presumably containing healthy or 
<br>
well formed proteins) is extracted and injected into the eggs 
<br>
of older women who are having difficulty in achieving 
<br>
pregnancy. This is illegal in Oz but not I think in the US. 
<br>
Problem (politically) is that in taking some of the cytoplasm 
<br>
you also take some of the mitochondria from the younger 
<br>
woman and you get two types of mitochondrial dna in the 
<br>
resulting infant. So far, so far as I know, this has not produced
<br>
any medical problems in any living infants ) of which there are
<br>
some. The technique has only been around a couple of years I
<br>
think.  Point is, defective proteins in the oocytes of the older 
<br>
women can be enough to prevent the DNA recipe being 
<br>
interpreted and the protein cake being made - no pregnancy
<br>
despite *apparently* viable dna). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I continue to be intrigued with the fact that about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 99% of the human DNA is considered &quot;junk.&quot; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the &quot;junk&quot; is 99%. 99% sounds like the popular
<br>
figure often quoted for the difference between humans
<br>
and chimps. Even in that context the 99% is debateable
<br>
and depends on what's being measured. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, if it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is &quot;junk&quot;, then it could presumably be deleted? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Right?  
</em><br>
<p>That's pretty much the point, or one of them, as I understand
<br>
it that Robert's been making about whole genome engineering.
<br>
The challenge is to identify the redundant &quot;junk&quot; or unused
<br>
part of the recipe book so as to better understand what's
<br>
going on. The understanding makes for faster and safer 
<br>
playing about. 
<br>
<p>The zebra or blow fish (I forget which) is a vertebrate like
<br>
us and so has much of the same instructions for construction
<br>
in its DNA but has far less unused dna (less junk dna). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; How hard would it be to test this with some
</em><br>
<em>&gt; organism with a lot of &quot;junk&quot; DNA but a small enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; total to make it practical to actually clean out a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large proportion of the &quot;junk&quot; and then see if the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; system still works.
</em><br>
<p>Some projects to do this are underway already. 
<br>
<p>I'm fuzzy on the details without looking them up (which I
<br>
should do but sorry I can't now because of time constraints)
<br>
but Craig Ventner has a group that (I think) is essentially 
<br>
trying to produce an organism with the minimal number of genes
<br>
to actually live and reproduce by knocking out redundant genes 
<br>
from a simple organism. Probably the nematode worm as it has
<br>
so few genes (900 odd) to begin with. 
<br>
<p>Theres another research group led by a guy called Blattner
<br>
that (again from memory) are trying to identify and knock out
<br>
redundant dna from a strain of E.coli.  E.coli would be one of
<br>
the prime biotech workhorses in that by modifying its genome 
<br>
we have converted it into a sort of factory for the production
<br>
of things like &quot;human insulin&quot;, &quot;human growth hormone&quot; and 
<br>
erythropoietin that is used in stimulating red blood cell formation.
<br>
All these things are medically useful and are being used as
<br>
treatments for existing medical conditions now.  
<br>
<p>How hard/easy is it? Well its getting easier all the time as more
<br>
is known about genes and genomes and comparisons can be
<br>
made between organisms. Sometimes gene cassettes, chunks
<br>
of code from one organism can be recognized to do something
<br>
useful and incorporated into the genome of another organism.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Might there not be significant advantages in deleting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that 99%, assuming that only the 1% is in fact useful?
</em><br>
<p>The percentages seem wrong to me, but yep, and its 
<br>
happening. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  A lot of the 99% is probably old viral garbage, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hazard.  Perhaps some of it is actually used by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cell for blocking viral reproduction in some way, so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that we wouldn't discover the use until it mattered?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure to what extent this is the case in humans, 
<br>
and we wouldn't be messing about with genomes as
<br>
complex as the mammalian one for this sort of stuff 
<br>
initially anyway. But plasmids in bacteria can in some
<br>
cases, just by being in the cell, block out other types
<br>
of similar plasmid which might be carrying viruses. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps, on the other hand, viruses have learned to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; use some of the &quot;junk,&quot; like common subroutines or old
</em><br>
<em>&gt; .dll's that the OS never uses until you happen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bring in some old program.  Removing it might disable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; those viruses.
</em><br>
<p>Almost certainly. But a problem with this sort of discussion
<br>
is that those that really understand this stuff well are probably
<br>
grinding their teeth at the oversimplification and errors and yet
<br>
if we don't try and popularise this stuff in ways that make
<br>
sense to non-experts we don't learn. (Apologies to all
<br>
teeth grinders).
<br>
<p>I reckon some of the real &quot;saints&quot; or &quot;storm troopers&quot; in the
<br>
van-guard of transhumanism, those who make a real difference
<br>
in the &quot;meme-wars&quot; are those that can popularise this sort of 
<br>
science and in so doing lift (by working on the natural curiosity 
<br>
of folk) the average punter's or voters general level of 
<br>
understanding. The best form of political &quot;propaganda&quot; around
<br>
stuff like stem cells and gene therapy is, imho, having more
<br>
people actually *understand* better what is going on.
