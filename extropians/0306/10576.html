David Carradine was the star of Kung Fu, and has an
<br>
auto-bio out which I own, but have never gotten around
<br>
to reading...  The original Kung Fu was reincarnated
<br>
sometime in the late '80's or early '90's, and moved
<br>
into present time, still starring Carradine, as some
<br>
kind of reincarnation of the original Shaolin priest
<br>
from the original show.  It was a sorta fun show, if
<br>
you had somehow run out of other things to do, or
<br>
mental steam.  Carradine boasts of having done truly
<br>
awesome amounts of LSD, apparently during both shows. 
<br>
The '90's show definitely looks like the inside of a
<br>
drug trip at times - no surprise.  I think Carradine
<br>
more or less directed as well as starring.
<br>
<p>Interesting that such a &quot;dangerous&quot; drug can be used
<br>
in quite large quantities by rather smart and/or
<br>
physically active/athletic types such as Carradine,
<br>
Kesey, Leary, etc., with no apparent damage and that
<br>
they can still function even while under the
<br>
influence...  And, yes, the original show was not bad
<br>
either, altho not stellar, IMHO.
<br>
<p>Actually, Bruce Lee was supposed to star in the
<br>
original, as I recall, and at the last moment they
<br>
went with Carradine.  I was taking Ishan Ru
<br>
Japanese/Okinawan karate when the first episode of
<br>
Kung Fu aired, and we stopped the class to watch and
<br>
critique.  Carradine was good, but my teacher - Virgil
<br>
Kimmey, Dragon Karate (still famous in karate circles)
<br>
- could have kicked his ass with one hand, or foot...
