<p><em>&gt; no doubt you are also preparing a pictorial compendium of the

</em><br>
<p>To which Damien Broderick responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;Had I ever made the extraordinary claim that the hideous Saddam Hussein
<br>
regime was bloodless, I'd expect to be pulled up short. Why is it so
<br>
difficult to grasp this?&quot;
<br>
<p>I don't recall ever claiming that you held the belief that Saddam Hussein's 
<br>
regime was bloodless. However, I cannot recall you regularly inundating the 
<br>
extropy list with smug rants about Hussein's barbarous regime while it was in 
<br>
power, yet I do notice your (for lack of better term) &quot;cheap shots&quot; at the 
<br>
American government. So, naturally you reply to me with the obligatory &quot;I'm no 
<br>
friend or supporter of Hussein&quot; comment. This is supposed to in some way exculpate 
<br>
your position of focusing solely on American actions while ignoring or 
<br>
accepting a status quo where far more despotic and murderous regimes remain in power? 
<br>
I do not think so.
<br>
<p>But more to the point, Spike had originally commented:
<br>
<p>With all
<br>
<em>&gt;those embedded reporters, there is almost no battle footage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;The whole episode was fiction, there was no war.  Clearly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the winner: humanity.  Technology has made war almost
</em><br>
<em>&gt;bloodless.
</em><br>
<p>Note he clearly said &quot;almost bloodless&quot;. Certainly there were civilian and 
<br>
military casualties in the war. However, when one compares this conflict to say, 
<br>
the Korean or Indochinese Wars, the number of dead in all categories falls 
<br>
dramatically. Now, clearly someone as clearly as intelligent as yourself is 
<br>
aware of this fact, and equally aware of the meaning of Spike's observation. 
<br>
Despite that fact, you chose to make in my view an unnecessarily hostile comment 
<br>
which mainly focused on American &quot;misdeeds.&quot; Everyone of those children you saw 
<br>
on the evening news could've been spared the misery they suffered during the 
<br>
war had Saddam Hussein simply willingly given up power and left Iraq before or 
<br>
at President Bush's deadline.
<br>
<p>Instead, the power mad butcher chose to put his people through an easily 
<br>
avoidable war in which some innocents were killed.  So, ultimately it appears that 
<br>
you are simply more interested in criticizing the Bush administration than 
<br>
giving the war in Iraq and its aftermath a fair hearing. Indeed, if your 
<br>
complaint was the fact that the book showed no dead bodies, might I suggest pictures 
<br>
of Hussein's mass graves found by US troops after the war?
<br>
<p>Regards from slightly right of center,
