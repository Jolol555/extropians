<p>
I have received some private email asking questions about my plans for
<br>
moderation.  Here are a few brief comments.
<br>
<p>First, I want to emphasize that this is a temporary role.  The time frame
<br>
discussed was about a week.  I am realistic enough to understand that it
<br>
may extend somewhat beyond that time, but I have no intention of becoming
<br>
a long-term moderator.
<br>
<p>Second, I also do not intend to deal with old issues.  I will try to
<br>
address new issues going forward, but I won't deal with old baggage.
<br>
That would be taking on an open-ended responsibility.  I realize that
<br>
many people feel that they have been wronged and still carry grudges
<br>
or feelings of resentment.  I'm sorry, but all I can suggest is that we
<br>
try to put these issues behind us and move on.
<br>
<p>Third, I only intend to enforce the list rules, which I have appended
<br>
below.  The main issue recently is personal attacks, dealing with
<br>
the character of the poster rather than the arguments he offers.
<br>
I realize that this is a gray area and that it is difficult to stay
<br>
on the right side of this line.  Nevertheless I would ask that list
<br>
members redouble their efforts to follow this rule.  Address arguments.
<br>
Avoid characterizing people.
<br>
<p>A question has arisen about how list members should respond to problems:
<br>
&quot;If someone attacks your character, insults you, or otherwise violates the
<br>
above rule, do NOT retaliate in like manner. Instead, send us a complaint
<br>
(to <a href="mailto:info@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">info@extropy.org</a>) and take the matter off-list.&quot;  I suggest also
<br>
copying my personal email address, <a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">hal@finney.org</a>, since I'm not sure
<br>
that <a href="mailto:info@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">info@extropy.org</a> is being forwarded to me.
<br>
<p>My reading of this is that you should complain if you, personally,
<br>
were attacked.  Don't complain on behalf of other people.  As far as
<br>
replying to attacking messages, the rules only say not to &quot;retaliate&quot;.
<br>
But keep in mind that if the message attacked you personally, it will be
<br>
very difficult for you to respond in an objective manner.  Experience
<br>
shows that once a thread becomes personal, it usually only gets worse.
<br>
In those cases it is best to register a complaint as described in the
<br>
rules and not to respond on the list.
<br>
<p>Last, if you do get a warning from me off-list, try to look at it
<br>
constructively.  My intention is to encourage vigorous and honest debate.
<br>
The best way to do that with controversial topics is to keep things
<br>
objective and impersonal.  If we can learn to argue in this way then
<br>
the quality of the list dialog will improve.
<br>
<p>Hal
