</em><br>
<p>What are some of the assumptions the DA makes to prove its point, for
<br>
which there is no evidence?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another interesting point is that the Doomsday Argument has been valid for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every era of humankind, even going back to Neanderthals and ancestral
</em><br>
<em>&gt; monkeys.  And it has always been wrong in its prediction every time.
</em><br>
<p>You could say the same thing about the dinosaurs and all of the other
<br>
members of the 99% of species that have gone extinct.  For each one
<br>
of those animals, the DA predicted that about as many of their species
<br>
would live after them as lived before them, within an order of magnitude
<br>
or so.  And it was right for 90% of those individuals.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should we suddenly assume that it will become accurate during our era?  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is like an ancient text carved in stone that says &quot;The End is Near!&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Eventually, it may become accurate, but not because of any impeccable logic.
</em><br>
<p>In fact, the hypothetical carved text has no logic whatsoever behind it,
<br>
it is an unsupported statement.  In contrast, the DA does have a chain
<br>
of logic that urges its conclusion.
