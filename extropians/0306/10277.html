With last week's thread on Semen-tics; I thought this article on the 
<br>
differences between guys and dolls would be interesting.
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nationalpost.com/home/story.html?id=3135D380-4E4D-4EBB-AE9D-736279E">http://www.nationalpost.com/home/story.html?id=3135D380-4E4D-4EBB-AE9D-736279E</a>

<p>&lt;&lt;Researchers studying female sexuality have found that women, regardless of 
<br>
their sexual orientation, are aroused by erotic images of both men and women, 
<br>
contrasting sharply with male arousal patterns.
<br>
<p>Does this suggest women are generally bisexual?
<br>
<p>Not necessarily so, say the scientists at Northwestern University in Chicago.
<br>
<p>&quot;Male sexual arousal is category-specific,&quot; said Meredith L. Chivers, a PhD 
<br>
candidate in clinical psychology at Northwestern and a psychology intern at the 
<br>
Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. She is the lead author of 
<br>
the study.
<br>
<p>&quot;Men show their greatest sexual arousal to the categories of people with whom 
<br>
they prefer to have sex. With respect to sexual orientation, heterosexual men 
<br>
experience much higher ... arousal to women than to men, while homosexual men 
<br>
show an opposite pattern.&quot;
<br>
<p>That link, for men, is so strong that courts rely on measures of sexual 
<br>
arousal for offenders being examined for sex crimes, particularly in determining 
<br>
pedophilia, the sexual attraction to children.
<br>
<p>An emerging body of research on female sexuality, however, suggests that 
<br>
women's sexual preferences cannot be reliably measured in the same way, with 
<br>
researchers classifying women's sexuality as &quot;more flexible&quot; than men's, with more 
<br>
variation in preferences, behaviour, attitudes and the impact of cultural 
<br>
norms.
<br>
<p>Ms. Chivers, who will present her findings at a public lecture at the centre 
<br>
on Wednesday, studied three groups of people for her study, which is to appear 
<br>
in a forthcoming issue of the academic journal Psychological Science.
<br>
<p>The researchers studied the responses of a group of men, a group of women, 
<br>
and a third group comprised of transsexuals, who have been surgically altered 
<br>
from male to female. The transsexuals were included to rule out the possibility 
<br>
that differences between men and women are the result of the differing ways 
<br>
genital arousal is measured because of the physical distinctness between the 
<br>
sexes.
<br>
<p>Researchers described the transsexuals as having the brains of a man but the 
<br>
genitals of a woman.
<br>
<p>All of the participants were privately shown six, two-minute films depicting 
<br>
a variety of sexually explicit material while wearing devices that measured 
<br>
genital blood flow.
<br>
<p>The heterosexual men were most aroused when watching female-female couplings 
<br>
and homosexual men to male-male couplings. The pattern for the transsexuals 
<br>
matched that of the men.
<br>
<p>Both heterosexual and homosexual women, however, experienced strong arousal 
<br>
to the images of both male-male and female-female couplings, the researchers 
<br>
found.
<br>
<p>&quot;Taken together, these results suggest that women's sexuality differs from 
<br>
men and emphasize the need for researchers to develop a model of the development 
<br>
and organization of female sexuality independent from models of male 
<br>
sexuality,&quot; Ms. Chivers said.
<br>
<p>The study adds to the view that &quot;female sexuality may be more motivated by 
<br>
extrinsic factors, such as the desire to create or maintain a romantic 
<br>
relationship, than intrinsic factors, such as genital sexual arousal,&quot; the study says.&gt;&gt;
