</em><br>
<p>Well, then...
<br>
<p>Let's suppose that we're in a simulation.  Any number of simulations, 
<br>
perhaps, since you can't distinguish between the pointer states.  Some 
<br>
simulations go all the way down to the quantum level; others are only as 
<br>
detailed as they need to be.
<br>
<p>Supposing that &quot;this&quot; world is a low-resolution sim, what kind of action 
<br>
would it take to force the simulator to compute you in greater detail? 
<br>
Let's say that I have a small electronic voice recorder.  If I speak into 
<br>
the voice recorder, download the audio file to my computer, and examine 
<br>
its internals bit by bit, then for the simulation of my high-level self to 
<br>
be accurate and fairly representative of probability, the simulation must 
<br>
have been accurate enough to determine any sensitivies of the voice 
<br>
recorder to minor subtleties of tone, background noise, and so on. 
<br>
Otherwise I'd see a '0' instead of a '1' when viewing the hex dump, which 
<br>
makes a gross difference to my cognitive processing.
<br>
<p>Aside from speaking into a voice recorder, does anyone else have any 
<br>
suggestions for creating a permanent record of an event which would force 
<br>
that event to be simulated in greater detail?  In particular, such that 
<br>
for the simulator to get a historically accurate probability distribution 
<br>
on the gross characteristics of the permanent record created (its ones and 
<br>
zeroes, which would be later examined), the simulator would find it useful 
<br>
to simulate the original event in greater-than-usual detail.
<br>
<p>Note that we are talking about making it *useful* for the simulator to 
<br>
expend more computing power, to simulate to a greater depth, in order to 
<br>
get a *more accurate* picture of the *probability distribution* of the 
<br>
ones and zeroes in the permanent record.  This means that the probability 
<br>
distribution of the permanent record depends on fine physical details in a 
<br>
way which can be usefully refined by expending more computing power. 
<br>
Assume that the initial conditions are 'spread out' evenly over whatever 
<br>
space of possibilities is permitted by the state of the existing 
<br>
low-resolution simulation at the moment when it begins modeling at greater 
<br>
detail, so that what we want is not just sensitive dependency on initial 
<br>
conditions, but the simulator's ability to get a more historically 
<br>
realistic picture of the probability distribution, after dropping from the 
<br>
previous low resolution into the evenly distributed high-resolution 
<br>
initial conditions, by expending more computing power to model the 
<br>
convergence of the development of those initial conditions at a finer 
<br>
level of detail.  So what we want is a physical process, which converges 
<br>
to some degree, which creates sensitive dependency in the permanent 
<br>
record, such that a noticeably more refined picture of the probability 
<br>
distribution of the permanent record can be obtained by expending more 
<br>
computing power to simulate that moment at a finer level of resolution.
<br>
<p>Or if that's too complicated: some way of creating a permanent record that 
<br>
sensitively depends on small details of the sim - either expensively, 
<br>
using off-the-shelf equipment, or (bonus points) using stuff lying around 
<br>
the house.
