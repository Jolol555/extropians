<p>Au contraire, what Martha did was NOT intelligent.  Too early to tell what
<br>
the judgment will be, but from what I understand there is NO RECORD of
<br>
Martha's instructions to her broker about the stop loss PRIOR to the day in
<br>
question when she may have gotten this alleged insider information.  Martha
<br>
was a stockbroker herself once, and could have avoided all this brouhaha had
<br>
she used stops consistently (to protect her positions, after deciding what
<br>
percentage loss she was willing to risk on each one), or trailing stops
<br>
(trailing them up to protect her profits).  She - of all people - should
<br>
have known better.  Good investors use good money management methods with
<br>
their stock positions - that's just a given, if one is interested in
<br>
protecting profits and limiting losses.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Her broker says: &quot;Hey Martha, Sam Waksal is selling his ImClone. Looks
</em><br>
like
<br>
<em>&gt; the drug isn't going to be approved.&quot;&gt; Martha thinks to herself: &quot;Hmm, who
</em><br>
better than Sam knows best when to sell&gt; ImClone?&quot;  &gt; She then instructs her
<br>
broker to sell her shares also.
<br>
<p>The burden of proof will be on Martha to prove that this transaction was
<br>
similar to her other stock transactions, but it looks like it may have been
<br>
a special case.  Therefore, what Martha did was NOT &quot;a good thing.&quot;  Aside
<br>
from the moral issues, Martha gave someone a stick to hit her with, and
<br>
*then* she apparently lied (thereby giving away, assembly-line style, even
<br>
more &quot;hitting&quot; sticks).
<br>
<p>Naughty, naughty Martha.
<br>
<p>Olga (who would like to see the *other* sleazeballs from the various stock
<br>
scandals put on trial, too ... why are they still out and about, quaffing
<br>
martinis by the poolside at their summer home(s)?)
