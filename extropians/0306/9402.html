<p>
AS&gt; &quot;Should&quot; is a troublesome word. Should as in a moral ought, or should as 
<br>
AS&gt; in always present?
<br>
<p>There  will always be inferiors and superiors. That's a fact where the
<br>
fittest feeds upon the weakest. Predators, right?
<br>
<p>The  way  I  see  it,  Overmen  (those  having  overcome  their  human
<br>
limits/capacities)  will  be above the humans. A plausible scenario is
<br>
that  humans  will  be  used  as  *unconscious*  servants/slaves  by the
<br>
overmen. It's natural.
<br>
<p>AS&gt; And why the assumption that evolution is always good 
<br>
AS&gt; or present?
<br>
<p>Evolution  is  always  about  the  survival of those who can adapt the
<br>
most.  In  that sense, it is good. It is about the persistence of life
<br>
and eventually (given adequate conditions) sentience.
<br>
<p>It  is  always  present,  one  way  or the other. The fact that it can
<br>
hardly  be  noticed (though sometimes it is happening in a way that it
<br>
cannot easily be seen or understood as it does not comply to criteria set by
<br>
general  consensus),  that  doesn't  mean that it's not happening. The
<br>
lifetime  of  average  man  is  negligible  when compared to millenia.
<br>
Yet... :)
<br>
<p>AS&gt; Yes. Or at least differential selection. However, the amount of 
<br>
AS&gt; variability in the genome that produces the maximal expected increase in 
<br>
AS&gt; fitness varies over time. Imagine a fitness landscape with a single 
<br>
AS&gt; peak in the otherwise fairly flat surface, and a population starting 
<br>
AS&gt; somewhere down on the plain.  At the start the optimal variance is very 
<br>
AS&gt; high, but most individuals have the same fitness. Then a few find the 
<br>
AS&gt; foothills of the mountain, and the differences in fitness between 
<br>
AS&gt; individuals increase. As the population climbs the mountain the optimal 
<br>
AS&gt; variance decreases, since the maximum is more likely closer than far 
<br>
AS&gt; away. Eventually the population ends up on the top and variance should 
<br>
AS&gt; be very small - there is no more fitness to find, and everybody has 
<br>
AS&gt; nearly the same fitness again.
<br>
<p>And  the  cycle  begins  anew...with  the emergence of superiors until
<br>
everybody reaches the same level (enthropy) and it starts again...
<br>
<p>AS&gt; Why assume a chain (i.e. a scalar fitness)? Things are far more 
<br>
AS&gt; multidimensional, and one can evolve towards many different niches and 
<br>
AS&gt; goals. I do not see a chain of being as a goal, but rather an immense 
<br>
AS&gt; tree of clades. 
<br>
<p>Seen in an overall point of view, yes. but invidually...I wonder...
<br>
Following  a  straight  chain,  superiority  will  exist.  Even  in  a
<br>
multimensional aspect it may prevail. But this is all relative...there
<br>
will  be  one  specie  who will dominate in most environments (this is
<br>
what  man  is doing right now, no? Not naturally of course, but nature
<br>
is not the only thing behind evoluton now...)
