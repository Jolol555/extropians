<em>&gt;Yes, except on the key question of not facing uncomfortable truths.  If
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;My impression is that the harm involved is substantially reduced if it
<br>
can be coordinated such that few people need to be significantly more
<br>
truthful than their peers at any one time. The benefits of deception seem
<br>
to be largely a matter of competition for relative advantages over other
<br>
people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt;  It is harder to have disgreements with stock market prices that persist
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;for years than it is to have persistent disgreements about how legislation
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is made, because market prices allow much less room for ambiguity and less
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;room for selective use of evidence than descriptions of the legislative
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;process do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;OK, I'll grant this point.  But can't people just not look at the prices?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Most people never read the business stock page in the paper, and have little
</em><br>
<em>&gt;idea of how IBM is doing.  The public is amazingly ignorant when they want
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to be.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I can imagine a stable futarchy in which the majority of voters ignore
<br>
all the issues that are decided by markets or believe the markets produce
<br>
poor enough results that they don't need to agree with the markets. But I
<br>
have trouble imagining how to get from here to there. The only obvious ways
<br>
to get futarchy adopted seem to involve persuading a majority of voters to
<br>
respect those markets more than they currently respect democracy. And that
<br>
would seem to require challenging those voters to either make money on those
<br>
markets or admit there's something wrong with the beliefs they cherish about
<br>
their abilities as voters.
