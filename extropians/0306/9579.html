At 11:22 PM 6/5/03 -0400, someone called Max Plumm, perhaps a nym (google
<br>
knows very little about this entity) wrote:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It was Damien who chose to use the phrase
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&quot;oily omelette&quot; in his harsh response to Spike.
</em><br>
<p>A sorrowful acknowledgement, in context, that perhaps control of oil
<br>
reserves in the middle east is a legitimate *realpolitik* motive for war on
<br>
Iraq by a high-tech, oil-dependant coalition.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I have never read a post of Damien's in which he refers to a Vietnamese
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Communist &quot;re-education camp omelette&quot;, a Castro or Mengistu's &quot;famine
</em><br>
<em>&gt;omelette&quot;, or even a Saddam Hussein's &quot;oily omelette&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>The occasion hasn't arisen.
<br>
<p>But the general point seems to me this: there is a moral asymmetry between
<br>
one's standpoint on 
<br>
<p>(a) issues where one's democratic representatives and their affiliates are
<br>
making decisions on one's behalf, 
<br>
<p>and (not-a) choices made by people outside one's sphere of influence. 
<br>
<p>If your deputy is acting in a way you regard as deplorable, it's up to you
<br>
to speak out. If someone over in the next town or nation is doing so, you
<br>
might take a keen interest, but you generally have a lesser moral
<br>
responsibility to speak out. 
<br>
<p>If Australian, British or US decision makers act, allegedly in my behalf,
<br>
it's far more urgent that I take stock of their actions and speak up for or
<br>
against their choices. If someone in Vietnam, where I have no stake or
<br>
control at all, acts abominably, I might speak up as a concerned, distant
<br>
observer, but the moral situation is rather different, I think. 
<br>
<p>When Palestinian youths blow up Israelis, I am horrified; when Israeli
<br>
soldiers blow up Palestinians, I am also horrified, perhaps more so, since
<br>
it seems to me, from this great distance, that the power imbalance is in
<br>
the Israelis' favor. 
<br>
<p>When I hear that Saddam and his sons and regime tortured and murdered
<br>
people, I am horrified; when I hear that US jails contain a million or more
<br>
prisoners many of them incarcerated for using marijuana and subjected in
<br>
prison to rampant rape and brutality, I am horrified as well. In the
<br>
absence of those *realpolitik* global considerations, I think that friends
<br>
of America should be acting by preference to save the victims in the US
<br>
prisons rather than those in the Iraqi prisons. But we do live in a real
<br>
world, so I admit that to sequester the oil reserves for me and my friends
<br>
and for technological civilization it might, after all, be worth expending
<br>
the lives of the willing and those of the innocent victims. The guilty
<br>
victims can rot, as we all agree. But let's not pretend that this choice
<br>
led to an almost bloodless war. There was plenty of blood.
<br>
