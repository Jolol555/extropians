<p><em>&gt; The Simulation Argument is silly.  It is circular logic.  First, you must
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assume that there are more simulations than realities.  Then, you conclude
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that since there are more simulations than realities, it is statistically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely that we are in one of them.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that the SA is circular.  A circular argument is
<br>
one where you assume your conclusion.
<br>
<p>Now let me clarify one thing: in a certain sense, every valid argument
<br>
has an element of circularity, because its conclusion is implicit in
<br>
its premises.  That's the definition of a valid argument!  But I would
<br>
reserve the term &quot;circular&quot; for arguments which use the conclusion,
<br>
or something very similar, as one of the premises.
<br>
<p>In the case of the SA, we don't just assume there are more simulations
<br>
than realities.  Even if we did, we'd have to combine this with the
<br>
premise that this numerical difference does give us grounds to believe
<br>
that we are experiencing the more numerous category.  So there is at
<br>
least one extra premise that makes the argument work.
<br>
<p>But more importantly, the claim that there are many simulations is
<br>
itself a conclusion, based on other premises.  We are a civilization
<br>
of a type which uses simulations extensively, both in our heads and in
<br>
our computers.  Once we gain technological advancement we will be able to
<br>
produce even more realistic simulations.  If our nature remains the same,
<br>
chances are that we will run simulations as real as the world is today.
<br>
And if other civilizations out there have a similar nature to our own,
<br>
they are probably doing so as well.
<br>
<p>It is from all of these premises that we derive the conclusion that
<br>
we are probably living in a simulation.  It is perfectly legitimate to
<br>
criticize these premises for lack of realism or plausibility.  But that
<br>
is a far cry from saying that the argument is circular.  Assuming that
<br>
we like to run simulations and that we'll soon have more computing power
<br>
is not the same as assuming that we live in a simulation.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; But what if we don't conclude that there are more simulations?  What if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations are rare?  What if perfect simulations of reality are just as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; boring as reality and nobody makes them?  What if perfect simulations are so
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonderful that only people from reality universes migrate into them and very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few simulated people get created?  What if simulations are almost always
</em><br>
<em>&gt; programmed to prevent discovery of the simulations, such that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discovery-possible simulations are extremely rare?  By assuming that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations are rare, then our circular logic would have to conclude that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; statistically speaking we are likely not to be in a simulation.
</em><br>
<p>I agree that if these premises turn out to be true, it would undercut
<br>
the argument that we live in a simulation.  However, again, that doesn't
<br>
make it a circular argument.  Rather, as for any valid argument, if you
<br>
invalidate its premises, the argument loses force.
<br>
<p>In the case of the simulation argument, while any of the possibilities
<br>
you list might occur, it is IMO more plausible to assume that people will
<br>
continue to use simulations much as we do today, as tools to model systems
<br>
under study.  And I think that past history, or even alternative past
<br>
histories, will be among the systems which are studied in that way.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Both of these conclusions are circular and lead people to believe what they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; want to believe.  There is no data either way to lead anybody into either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conclusion.  Whatever people already believe, that is where their circular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; logic will lead them.  There is no statistical support in either direction.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see why you think the simulation argument makes people believe
<br>
what they want to believe.  Are you opposing the argument for this kind
<br>
of emotional reason, and then projecting such motivations onto others?
<br>
I hope not.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Furthermore, I believe their are other counter-examples to the simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - Occam's Razor suggests that simpler, more direct explanations are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to be correct.  In the absence of data, there is no reason to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; postulate unfalsifiable, hidden, mystical worlds that cannot be detected or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tested.  Why stop there?  Why not postulate that every religion is true?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That all fictional stories are real?  That imaginary creatures are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everywhere when we're not looking?  Etc.?
</em><br>
<p>Again, no one is postulating that we live in a simulation.  That is
<br>
a conclusion, which should not be confused with a premise.  The SA
<br>
postulates that civilizations like ours will run simulations of people
<br>
like us.  That is much less of a reach than to postulate that every
<br>
religion is true, or that imaginary creatures are everywhere.  There is
<br>
no comparison between these, and I can't imagine how you could think
<br>
there is.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; - Theories are supposed to predict observed phenomenon.  This theory is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; untestable.  It predicts nothing, explains nothing, and provides no further
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information about how the universe works.  Unless some theorized difference
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between a real universe and a simulated universe can be predicted, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory will never be testable.
</em><br>
<p>The SA is not a theory.  As its name suggests, it is an argument.
<br>
It takes premises and works to a conclusion.  To the degree that we
<br>
accept the premises, logic will &quot;take us by the throat&quot; and force us to
<br>
accept the conclusion, no matter how disagreeable.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; - The very calculation of &quot;more likely to be in a simulation&quot; seems suspect
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to me.  To do such a simple calculation we would need real measurements, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more importantly, some sort of mechanism for counting universes and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; simulations.  If many-worlds interpretation says there are an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; number of real universes, how can there be more simulations than infinity?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If every possible universe exists, wouldn't that include many (or most)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes without simulations?
</em><br>
<p>This gets into some pretty slippery philosophical stuff which I won't
<br>
try to deal with at this time.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; - As an absurd argument, why not count dreams?  They are simulations of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universe that seem real to us at the time.  There are many more dreams than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; universes (either simulated or natural).  Wouldn't this imply that we are in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a dream instead of a simulation or reality?
</em><br>
<p>There may be a lot of dreams, but they don't last very long, and they're
<br>
not really that convincing, I don't think.  They only seem so because
<br>
our minds are dulled.  The total measure of observer-moments in reality
<br>
is probably quite a bit greater than in dreams.
