From: Robert J. Bradbury [mailto:<a href="mailto:bradbury@aeiveos.com?Subject=RE:%20greatest%20threats%20to%20survival%20(was:%20why%20believe%20the%20truth?)">bradbury@aeiveos.com</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; But we know that there are people who can live past 90 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without dying of heart disease or cancer -- so one has to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assign a significant part of the responsibility to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-inflicted causes (smoking, poor diet, etc.) and probably 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an even larger fraction to genetic defects. 
</em><br>
<p>Smoking and poor diet merely hasten death.  Aging (unless halted)
<br>
makes death inevitable.
<br>
<p>In fact, most people who die in their 80s or later have multiple
<br>
terminal conditions (though they may not realize it).  If you cure
<br>
one, a different one will get them just a few years later.  
<br>
<p>Indeed, up until age 100 or so our total risk of death from any cause
<br>
rises year after year.  Between the ages of 30 and 80 this is an
<br>
exponential increase, with the risk of death from any cause doubling
<br>
every 7-8 years.  Aging causes a systemic loss of our defenses against
<br>
illness and death.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are just 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; too many people who don't get heart disease or cancer to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; place the blame on &quot;aging&quot; per se. 
</em><br>
<p>To a first approximation, young people don't get heart disease or
<br>
cancer, and old people don't die of anything but heart disease or
<br>
cancer.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Aging&quot; may be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; contributing factor but I suspect poor genetic combinations 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are a big part of the problem as well.  Does one call 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutations in the FAP or HNPCC genes that predispose one to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; colon cancer or the several mutations that predispose one to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Alzheimer's disease &quot;aging&quot;?  I would argue no.  Yes those 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people age -- but the &quot;cause of death&quot; should be assigned to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having a losing ticket in the genetic lottery.
</em><br>
<p>Yet 25 year olds don't often die of cancers.  The risk of cancer
<br>
increases exponentially with age.  Nor does this seem to be merely a
<br>
factor of the passage of time - Animals that have their aging process
<br>
slowed through genetic manipulations also have their cancer risk
<br>
shifted to later in life, even though the genes being manipulated are
<br>
not themselves oncogenes.
<br>
<p>So it's not just about these cancer-associated alleles.  It's also
<br>
about the increased vulnerability to cancer that old age brings.  
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
