<em>&gt; &gt; - The beginnings of a book
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; manuscript, &quot;Debunking for Dummies.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or &quot;Ranting By Example&quot; would work equally well.
</em><br>
<p>Was this comment meant to be clever or enlightening?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (snipped lots of reasonable-ish text descending gradually into ranting)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm picking this up here where the writer really begins to go off the rails.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hopefully someone else will have the time/energy for a point-by-point
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debunking.
</em><br>
<p>You just had the time/energy for general smarminess?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; One pertinent point to note from this statement is how pseudo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skeptics always talk in terms of how the general public needs to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; told what is best for them (by the pseudo-skeptic of course). And
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; yet they wonder why the public is disdainful. The other point is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that the jealousy of the debunker has at its root their deep-seated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; desire to have their particular worldview validated.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bzzzt, no. In a complex society such as our own, no one has the resources or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ability to research every claim. We rely on each other's efforts to validate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a small portion of the claims out there, using a common frame of reference -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality. It's not always perfect, for many reasons, but it's important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that somebody makes the effort to check claims, and when frauds/bs are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; found, it's quite valid to publicize it as widely as possible. I know that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; personally appreciate this.
</em><br>
<p>This is reasonable.  Frauds/bs should be shot down, I think we all
<br>
appreciate this.  What isn't appreciated is shooting down claims that have
<br>
not been demonstrated to be frauds/bs.  To believe something without proving
<br>
your belief is to fall back on what can be surmised to be a psychological
<br>
need.  Or a template of handling data.  In either case, many rational
<br>
individuals find fault with that behavior.
<br>
<p>See, you don't have time to investigate the claims, but you do have time to
<br>
&quot;debunk&quot; them.  That's like saying you don't have time to mow the lawn, but
<br>
you do have time to tell every person within five miles of you that your
<br>
lawn doesn't need mowing.  The claims are there to be mowed, but mowing
<br>
takes physical effort.  Rhetoric is easier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So what is the underlying reason for the debunkers position? Why do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; they feel the need to &quot;portray science not as an open-minded process
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of discovery, but as a holy war against unruly hordes of quackery&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (14)? The obvious conclusion is that behind this behaviour lies a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; large amount of insecurity.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;obvious&quot;: code for &quot;bullshit&quot; in most contexts
</em><br>
<p>Huh?  Is this an obvious declaration on your part?  Are you trying to prove
<br>
your own thesis?
<br>
<p>Skeptics have no problem declaring that (thisgroupofpeoplewhobelieveXYZ) is
<br>
insecure; when they are called insecure for the beliefs that they hold, they
<br>
can't appreciate the analogous reasoning behind the claim.  I don't know if
<br>
this skeptic or that skeptic is an insecure person.  However, anytime anyone
<br>
says that their belief is above question, they are certainly being insecure
<br>
in that instance
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; In particular, anxiety that a carefully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; constructed world-view, which helps them to make sense of the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and also often bestows upon them a position of power, may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; dismantled at any moment. Any attempts by 'pseudo-scientists' to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; investigate outside this world-view are regarded as a threat, an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; attempt to pull the comfortable rug out from beneath the debunker's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; feet. As much as the true skeptic harbours doubts about their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; stance, the debunker attempts to convince themselves and others,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; through any means possible, that they are right. How can the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; debunker, therefore, ever be considered anything more than a pseudo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skeptic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The flimsy crap about debunkers wears really thin by now. I think this guy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is attacking a strawman (or a horde of them)... any pro-science person worth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their salt knows that paradigms shift in all kinds of disciplines all the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time. Doubt and science go together. That's the very reason for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; aggressive critical stance!
</em><br>
<p>If you truly believe this, than the person who wrote the article (the same
<br>
article that you didn't have time to debunk point by point) isn't speaking
<br>
about you.  Doubt and science go together.  No one is saying that people
<br>
should not be aggressively critical.  The key word is critical.  Criticism
<br>
is not equivalent to trumpeting &quot;bullshit&quot; at something that goes against
<br>
your belief system.  That's aggressive name-calling.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; That's not to say, however, that criticism of alternative theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is incorrect or somehow morally wrong in any way. Ideas and theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should always be questioned, but in a respectful manner, and with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the humility to realise that any position may prove to be completely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; incorrect.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is a respectful manner? It'd be sad if &quot;alternative theorists&quot; had
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their feelings hurt I guess. Wannabe scientific theories are guilty until
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proven innocent.
</em><br>
<p>A respectful manner means pointing out, detail by detail, why something is
<br>
incorrect.  Failure to do so reinforces the conception that science is too
<br>
often a hyper-sensitive refuge for people who cannot tolerate the
<br>
questioning of their own beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; We should always question what we believe, and also why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we do so. In the end though, it is each person's inalienable right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to construct a view of the world which fits the evidence of their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experience best, and helps them to understand the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure, and let natural selection sort them out...
</em><br>
<p>Depends on the selecting mechanism.  Who is doing the selecting, and what is
<br>
the rationale behind the selecting?  By &quot;them&quot;, are you referring to people
<br>
or ideas?  If you are referring to ideas, note that ideas (good or bad)
<br>
never die out.  If you are referring to people, note that people have always
<br>
believed what they want to believe and will continue to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; debunker does not believe in this philosophy however, and feels the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; need to impose their personal viewpoint upon others.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, not really. A sceptical person may feel a moral (!) duty to point out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bullshit (even potential bullshit) that preys apon the unwary.
</em><br>
<p>Thanks for the refreshing honesty!  All of this is a morality play.  We have
<br>
placed each other into classifications (scientists, sceptics, debunkers,
<br>
believers, ignorant masses, fanatics, obscuritists, intermediasts) and have
<br>
decided how each classification that isn't our own needs to be treated.  Our
<br>
personal beliefs compel us to act in a certain way, and a failure to act in
<br>
that way would go against the morality that our own belief demands of us.
<br>
<p>Now all I can suggest is that we be more appreciative of other person's
<br>
moralities.  Your morality (if I have understood the above comment
<br>
correctly) demands that you watch out for the uneducated, or those who lack
<br>
the intellectual ability to fend off ideas that you consider false.  This
<br>
influences the way in which you do so.  Treating ideas that you have decided
<br>
to be false with respect would make them commensurate in the eyes of who you
<br>
classify as &quot;the unwary&quot;, so you determine it is better to treat the ideas
<br>
you believe are false with contempt.  That is your morality.  I disagree
<br>
with your morality.  And understand, many people who you classify as &quot;the
<br>
unwary&quot; disagree with your morality as well.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; said here is that one's worldview is not just a touchy-feely matter of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; choice; it shapes one's life in many ways.
</em><br>
<p>Exactly.  It shapes your morality and behavior.  Your morality and behavior
<br>
speak for itself.  I can only judge you on what you've written here.  It is
<br>
a result of your world view, and a demonstration of how that world view has
<br>
influenced you.  There's nothing touchy-feely about this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A poor choice of religion can rob
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the unwary of their personal possessions and freedom.
</em><br>
<p>Nietzsche's religion robbed him of his life.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A bad alternative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therapy can kill not only the believer, but those in his/her charge.
</em><br>
<p>How many people die in hospitals every day?  &quot;Alternative therapy&quot; suggests
<br>
a normative therapy.  A history of medicine will detail case after case of
<br>
normative therapies being disastrous for not only the believer, but those in
<br>
his/her charge.  Let's just find the best therapies, and lose the
<br>
alternative label.  Call the alternatives &quot;bad&quot; if they kill people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; A reliance on suspect divination and pseudo-psychological techniques can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irreparably damage a person's mind.
</em><br>
<p>Damn straight.  Look at Carl Sagan.  His first two wives had some horrible
<br>
things to say about the state of his mind.  But neither of those two women
<br>
were scientists, so what did they know?  Carl's Sagan's first three kids
<br>
don't like him either, but how dare they expect a father with a stable mind?
<br>
<p>A reliance on ANYTHING can irreparably damage a person's mind.  Like
<br>
marijuana and Carl Sagan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And because everyone can't evaluate all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the evidence all the time, and some people can't really evaluate much of it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; at all, it is important that those who can do a decent job of it are really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; vocal about problematic and potentially dangerous theories.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Those who do a decent job of it.&quot;  A decent job of it is not a declaration
<br>
of &quot;bullshit&quot;.  I can and do respect a decent job of debunking.  Of course
<br>
&quot;decent&quot; is a tricky word.  Decent should not necessarily mean that which
<br>
provides a result that fits my world-view.  It can mean that, and it may
<br>
often mean that.
<br>
<p>What about the people who evaluate the evidence of anomalous claims, and
<br>
come up with conclusions that do not fit your world-view?  Those must have
<br>
been in-decent jobs, right?  Decent is what fits your morality, and
<br>
in-decent is what doesn't.  You are ably demonstrating that this is about
<br>
your morality more than anything else.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; It is high time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that all parties showed more respect for philosophies different to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; theirs, and made an attempt to understand them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; All of them???
</em><br>
<p>I agree with you here.  I don't think that all philosophies are worthy
<br>
enough to be understood.  But if we are talking about philosophies which, at
<br>
least, claim to be based on things that occurred, those are worthy of
<br>
investigation.  And if you are going to investigate something, you should
<br>
have a detached attitude (ie RESPECT) for that something.  Akin to a
<br>
reporter who has to cover a story.  Be objective.  That is being respectful.
<br>
Don't use inflammatory language.  That is being an editorialist.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; If the pseudo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; skeptic does not take my word for it, perhaps they'll listen to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; James Alcock, who wrote in Skeptical Inquirer (with the emphasis
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; added being mine) &quot;we may differ in our assumptions about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; underlying nature of reality, but we are much the same as each
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other&quot; (15).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personally, I'll take the red pill.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Emlyn
</em><br>
<p>You believe what you want to believe.  Graham Hancock believes what he wants
<br>
to believe.  Your beliefs are different, your morality is different, but
<br>
each of you is driven by your beliefs and morality.  In that way you are the
<br>
same.  Objective reality is superior to you, him, and all of us.  Our
<br>
theories and beliefs can approach objective reality, and some will approach
<br>
much closer than others.  Let's just respect everyone who is on the same
<br>
quest.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; (ooh, I just noticed this tidbit:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;As physicist Henry Stapp argues, physicalist science on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; its own is dangerous, because it leaves &quot;no rational basis for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anything but self-interest the collapse of moral philosophy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inevitable&quot;(9).&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It reminds me of that idea, disturbingly held by real christians that I have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; met, that Atheists can have no morality and must be happy to run around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; killing people and commiting all kinds of debaucherous acts.)
</em><br>
<p>I've met real Atheists who believe that Christians have no morality and are
<br>
happy to kill abortion doctors and homosexuals all the live-long day.  Which
<br>
just proves that all peope have the same silly prejudices about people who
<br>
are &quot;other&quot;.
