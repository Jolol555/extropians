<p>This is a good summary of the arguments from the SEC's perspective. 
<br>
<p>I dispute them, however. In particular I dispute the notion that there are
<br>
real &quot;victims&quot; when a person trades on material non-public information. 
<br>
<p>Martha Stewart, for example, allegedly dumped her ImClone stock based on
<br>
information that Sam Waksal, the founder of ImClone, was dumping his stock.
<br>
Waksal new or strongly suspected that the FDA was about to deny the approval
<br>
of his company's cancer drug. Obviously Stewart saved a lot of money by
<br>
selling in advance of the news. Those who did not sell in advance of the
<br>
news lost money, but this would have been the case even if Martha Stewart
<br>
had not sold her stock. ImClone shareholders were destined to take a big hit
<br>
regardless of any trading by Martha Stewart. Her insider trading did not
<br>
cause the stock to drop significantly -- it was the failure of the drug to
<br>
get FDA approval that caused the stock to drop.
<br>
<p>The real problem for investors today (and I speak as one who was in the
<br>
investment business for more than a decade) is that the financial markets
<br>
are extremely efficient. Though it is one of the best kept secrets on Wall
<br>
Street, (and the most denied truth), it is quite literally impossible to
<br>
make an excess return (that is, a return above the market return adjusted
<br>
for risk) by trading on PUBLIC information. Public information is discounted
<br>
instantly into the stock price. Numerous academic studies show this to be
<br>
true, (even while millions of hopeful stock investors read the business
<br>
section and then hope or pretend that it must not apply to them).
<br>
<p>To make an excess return in the financial markets one must acquire and act
<br>
on information that is not already widely disseminated. But they call that a
<br>
crime in this country.
