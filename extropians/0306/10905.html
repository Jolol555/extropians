</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; at least a year now...&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;...I was joking about wiping away any feelings of guilt that

<em>&gt; &gt;at will...  Brett Paatsch
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Surgical removal of guilt feelings would be a wildly
</em><br>
<em>&gt;popular application of such a technology, were it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;to become available.  Of course one would suffer
</em><br>
<em>&gt;condemnation from *every* major religion, this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;being their jealously guarded line of business,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;in which they would not welcome additional competition.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A better use of this tech would be in dentistry.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Do let me offer this scenario:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A coworker comes to the office raaaaving about a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;wonderful new dentistry office in town, Needleman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;and Paatsch.  One goes into the office, wait for ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt;name to be called, then as if by magic one immediately
</em><br>
<em>&gt;find oneself again in the sitting room, teeth all
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fixed, three hours past and no problem at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Coworkers try this and all agree, it is the very most
</em><br>
<em>&gt;perfectly painless oral procedure ever.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;So you go in, but being an inquiring mind, you ask
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the practitioners what is this wonderful anesthetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they have discovered.  They tell you it isn't anesthetic
</em><br>
<em>&gt;at all, but a post op memory wipe.
</em><br>
<p>You know, we know that general anesthesia can in rare cases just paralyze 
<br>
the recipient, but leave them able to remember the whole operation.  And we 
<br>
know (me from personal experience) that people coming out from anesthesia 
<br>
may appear to be perfectly conscious, but not form any memories for a while 
<br>
after appearing to awaken.  Thus, I suspect I've already done something 
<br>
similar to the people going to Needleman...  I'd be very happy if someone 
<br>
could tell me why I'm wrong.
