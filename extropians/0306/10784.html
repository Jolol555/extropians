<p>Bioethicists Debate the Coming of Post-humanity
<br>
<p>New Haven, CT - June 27, 2003 - Boston University's George Annas and
<br>
UCLA's Greg Stock will meet in an historic debate, Friday, June 27,
<br>
8pm-10pm, in the Davies Hall (Becton Center, 15 Prospect Street) on the
<br>
Yale Campus in New Haven, to address the question &quot;Should Humans Welcome
<br>
or Resist Becoming Posthuman?&quot;
<br>
<p>George Annas J.D., the chair of Health Law at Boston University, wants
<br>
an international treaty to declare cloning and inheritable genetic
<br>
enhancements to be crimes against humanity. Professor Annas' books
<br>
include The Rights of Patients and Some Choice: Law, Medicine and the
<br>
Market. Professor Annas is the co-founder of Global Lawyers and
<br>
Physicians and the Patients Rights Project.
<br>
<p>Greg Stock Ph.D., Director of the Program on Medicine, Technology and
<br>
Society at UCLA, wants parents to have broad rights to clone, and
<br>
enhance their kids' genomes in inheritable ways. Professor Stock is
<br>
author of Redesigning Humans: Our Inevitable Genetic Future and
<br>
Engineering The Human Germline.
<br>
<p>Dr. Stock acknowledges that parents' use of reproductive technology
<br>
needs some oversight. But he insists that any &quot;regulation should be
<br>
minimal, should address real rather than imagined problems, and should
<br>
be concerned with the child's safety rather than social order or the
<br>
personhood of embryos. When it comes to children, I trust the judgment
<br>
of individual parents more than that of political or judicial panels.&quot;
<br>
<p>Professor Annas, a leading figure in American bioethics, counters that
<br>
&quot;Uncontrolled use of the new genetic technologies risks setting us on a
<br>
dehumanizing road to genetic genocide. We need a comprehensive global
<br>
treaty that bans the most dangerous genetic technologies while allowing
<br>
beneficial medical applications to proceed.&quot;
<br>
<p>This debate is sponsored by the World Transhumanist Association and the
<br>
Yale Interdisciplinary Bioethics Program Working Research Group on
<br>
Technology and Ethics. The debate is the opening event of the conference
<br>
TRANSVISION 2003 (TV03)  &quot;The Adaptable Human Body: Transhumanism and
<br>
Bioethics in the 21st Century,&quot; taking place at Yale's Linsly-Chittenden
<br>
Hall (62 High St.) June 28-29, 2003.  The World Transhumanist
<br>
Association is a global non-profit organization devoted to defending
<br>
individuals' rights to use technology to transcend the limitations of
<br>
the human body.
