<p>&lt;&lt;Now, how can an US citizen &quot;attack the US&quot; with his writings? He is not
<br>
less US than the people he is attacking. If what you write is true, this
<br>
is a piece of the US criticizing another piece of the US. But then this is
<br>
not attacking, it's just an aspect of politics.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Obviously, you do not have maniacs and fanatics in Italia ;-) !!
<br>
In the delusional writings of the Ku Klux Klan, (Turner Diaries) the author 
<br>
dreamed of a Nazi homeland in the Pacific northwest on the continental United 
<br>
States, a fantasy place of rifles, deathcamps, and ignorance. This is an 
<br>
extreme example of the kind of mentality that has existed.

<br>
<p>Technically, you are absolutely correct. However, if you look to the 20th 
<br>
century history of Central and South America, you find many examples of 
<br>
situations where the &quot;Army&quot; would massacre the citizenry. One can ask, &quot;Where do the 
<br>
members of the Army come from, Mars?&quot; The answer is that in many cultures the 
<br>
ties between citizen and citizen, and citizen and those people who make up the 
<br>
State are strained or non-existant.  A person, in a land that permits free 
<br>
speech may advocate things that are harmful, and yes, even devastating to the rest 
<br>
of the populace. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;  Of course you can answer that 80%+ americans support Bush-style foreign
<br>
politics. But then, you are still labelling 20% of americans as against
<br>
themselves.
<br>
Ciao,

Alfio &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>There are people, who would like to see the nation-state of America 
<br>
destroyed, and destroyed without a sound basis for any viable replacement. Just as 
<br>
there are vicious empty-headed people of the Right, with their white robes and 
<br>
hoods who advocate America's destruction (The South shall rise again!), there 
<br>
have been vicious, empty-headed people of the Left, who seem to wish the worst 
<br>
for the America.  Gore Vidal and Noam Chomsky would be just two examples. A pity 
<br>
they have been taken so seriously in Europe. But then most Europeans appear 
<br>
to enjoy what they say and agree with them, yes?
