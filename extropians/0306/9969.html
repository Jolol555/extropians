<p>
<em>&gt; And the same could be said of Saddam.  However, Saddams moral 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goals, that of remaining a murderous dictators, are far more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; repugnant that the Coalitions moral goals.  Do you agree? 
</em><br>
<p>Hardly; both are seeking to maintain power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam had backed down, there would have been no senseless 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; waste of time, energy, money, goodwill, and ~20 million 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Iraqis would have been freed without one drop of Blood being 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shed.  Yet you and others still insist the coalition bears 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the moral culpability.
</em><br>
<p>I was planning on releasing this to the press Monday morning, but....
<br>
<p>&quot;President Bush.  It pleases me to inform you that you should abdicate
<br>
Your thron...OFFICE prior to the end of the week.  If you do so you will
<br>
Ensure that there is &quot;no senseless waste of time, energy, money,
<br>
goodwill, and 
<br>
~288 million Americans would have been freed without one drop of Blood
<br>
being 
<br>
shed. If you do not vacate your office immediately, I (and history)
<br>
will hold you morally culpabable.&quot;
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Again, just as Emlyn, you ignore the Gulf War I, in which 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Saddam invaded another country we agreed to defend.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolutions calling for the end of the open fighting in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conflict were the ones that were violated and instigated res 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1441.  Saddam did nothing less than break the agreements that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ended Gulf War I.  Yet we were the invaders?  Never mind the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple other compelling reasons to oust Saddam.
</em><br>
<p>Uh, just in case you didn't know, Kuwait was originally part of Iraq,
<br>
Like Sudan was part of Egypt.  In point of fact, Iraq refused to
<br>
recognize
<br>
Kuwait as an independent country until 2 years *AFTER* the gulf war.
<br>
So as far as I'm concerned, Saddam didn't invade anybody.  He was
<br>
putting down a long-standing rebellion when the rebels invited in a
<br>
foreign
<br>
power because they were scared of the consequences.  This particular
<br>
scene
<br>
With foreign powers and psuedo independent states etc has been played
<br>
out
<br>
Repeatedly through history.  I can't technically fault the man for his
<br>
&quot;invasion&quot;;
<br>
Kuwait would have expanded his capabilities.  'course he got his butt
<br>
spanked by
<br>
The US, but that's another story.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I am out of my mind?  I have still yet to hear you say that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no one has the right to be a dictator.  As an extropian, can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you not even acknowledge the basic moral premise that no one 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has the right to be a dictator?
</em><br>
<p>It *is* technically better than anarchy.
<br>
&lt;grin&gt;
<br>
<p>omard-out
