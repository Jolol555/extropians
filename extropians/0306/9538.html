</em><br>
<p>I suppose that, on a strictly Bayesian reading of the term, it is 
<br>
evidence; if psi existed, the probability of the prize being claimed would 
<br>
be greater than it is with psi not existing.  Therefore, that the prize is 
<br>
not claimed, is evidence.
<br>
<p>But strong evidence or weak evidence?  And is it evidence admissible by 
<br>
the standard of science, or even an American civil jury?  I do not 
<br>
hesitate to hold CSICOP, self-declared carriers of the banner of 
<br>
rationality, to a high standard.  They blew it with Gauquelin; they're 
<br>
gone.  If psi did exist, it might appear on only a single occasion within 
<br>
a horde of fakes.  No matter how many fakes you successfully detect, you 
<br>
cannot afford to get sloppy.  If CSICOP rejects any claim, even a false 
<br>
claim, by a flawed process which would also have rejected a true claim, 
<br>
then they have blown it; all their rejections are worthless.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gauquelin could easily force the issue by taking Randi and CSICOP to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; court, and a million bucks on the line would make it worthwhile for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; him to do so (and for some pro-psi lawyer to help). The fact that he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can't even meet /that/ test is significant, regardless of any personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pecadillos of Randi and gang.
</em><br>
<p>I don't believe that Gauquelin was in pursuit of the Randi Prize as such.
<br>
<p>Even though I am personally still sure psi does not exist, the personal 
<br>
pecadillos of Randi and gang render the prize unsuitable as scientific 
<br>
evidence.  They would not hesitate to dismiss a psi study on weaker 
<br>
grounds.  The good guys must meet higher standards than the bad guys, and 
<br>
that is as it should be.
<br>
<p>I am sure that Gauquelin's results are either coincidental or indicative 
<br>
of something other than astrological influences.  It is interesting how, 
<br>
if you search hard enough, you will eventually find *something*, or 
<br>
believe that you have...  If psi is being held to a stricter standard than 
<br>
other areas of science, then this is indeed unjust.  We should subject the 
<br>
other areas of science to equally hard scrutiny, or we are not safe.  Psi 
<br>
demonstrates how easy it is to find effects hovering on the border of 
<br>
&quot;statistical significance&quot;, if you are in pursuit of an ideology, if you 
<br>
run enough different experiments and don't count the failed ones as 
<br>
counterevidence against the validity of the field itself.  Who knows how 
<br>
many other fields have accumulated the same false positives as psi, but 
<br>
without the skeptical scrutiny to which psi has been subjected?  Consider 
<br>
psi as the control in a controlled study on the effectiveness of the 
<br>
standard scientific method:  &quot;We'll go hunting for something that 
<br>
*definitely* does not exist, and see if we can find evidence for it if we 
<br>
look hard enough and run enough studies.&quot;  If psi researchers have been 
<br>
able to meet the criteria of science, then the standard scientific method 
<br>
is revealed as too lax.  Perhaps we need to find a standard harsh enough 
<br>
to reject all psi experiments (as evidence for psi), then apply that 
<br>
standard to science as a whole.
