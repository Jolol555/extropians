<p>Actually, in a extremely rare case where I would object to a statement
<br>
Eliezer makes (I'm at times stupid but I'm not *that* stupid to do this
<br>
frequently), I have to object here.
<br>
<p>The declining force of natural selection with age *cannot* allow an
<br>
organism to be &quot;designed to age&quot;.  The best you can manage is
<br>
a failure of the programs that keep the organism young.
<br>
<p>Mammals started out as very small (bottom of the food chain) short-lived
<br>
organisms.  Everything else in a mammalian genome should be viewed as
<br>
an &quot;add-on&quot; -- as we got bigger we had to develop better defenses
<br>
against cancer (e.g. telomere shortening) -- as our lives grew longer
<br>
we slowly moved from a R-selection reproductive strategy to a K-selection
<br>
reproductive strategy.  During that process the genomes (in humans,
<br>
elephants and whales) adapted to &quot;preserve&quot; youth for as long as
<br>
was necessary (essentially until the hazard function dictated that
<br>
there was a high probability that the individual would have died from
<br>
&quot;natural&quot; causes).
<br>
<p>There is no &quot;program for aging&quot; -- there is a &quot;program which fails
<br>
to keep you young indefinitely&quot;.  It is a subtle but significant
<br>
difference.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unshortening telomeres, immortality, are not just an incidental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; characteristic of cancer cells, they are the heart of the problem.
</em><br>
<p>Not really.  Endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells do not divide
<br>
*that* often -- so I suspect that long telomeres in such cells do
<br>
not present a significant risk -- muscle cells and to a lesser
<br>
extent endothelial cells do not generally become cancerous.
<br>
Now long telomeres in epithelial cells (skin, gut, etc.) --
<br>
now *those* I would be concerned about because they are constantly
<br>
dividing and are thus biased to become cancerous (in fact the
<br>
epithelial cells probably have some low levels of telomerase
<br>
activity to lengthen their telomeres).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The human body was not designed to be easily revised for immortality.  It's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed to burn out and die.
</em><br>
<p>No, you cannot say it is &quot;designed&quot; that way.  Its a lack of a sufficiently
<br>
robust design to *not* &quot;burn out and die&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Shortening telomeres prevents cancer when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you're young, and that's pretty much all Nature cares about.
</em><br>
<p>This is probably essentially correct.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is not the job of *these* researchers to untangle the problems of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immortality.  If they can give us small vessel grafts, good enough.
</em><br>
<p>I would tend to agree here -- small vessel grafts could buy many people
<br>
perhaps decades -- enough to keep us going until the more robust technologies
<br>
kick in.
