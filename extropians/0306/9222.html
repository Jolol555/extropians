Olga:
<br>
&lt;&lt;
<br>
<em>&gt; ***Do you think this is what happend to Charles Colson and Eldridge Cleaver 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (imagine that, closet atheists!)?  &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p><p>I believe that Cleaver was an atheist, and Colson was already a nominal 
<br>
Christian.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;
<br>
<em>&gt; ***From what I've read, people who are nontheists (and I would add here, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;nonsupernaturalists&quot;) tend to be better educated (with scientists and the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientifically-inclined making up a sizeable percentage of this group, but this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is *by no means* the only group representing nontheists), and also tend to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better off financially (generally speaking) than religious people.  On the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world's stage, this would seem to be true, as well - the poorest countries are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; usually the most religious, and the most industrialized countires are usually 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the least religious&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Talent at making money does not seem to be an axiom regarding religious 
<br>
beliefs of the hostility to them. Lots of broke people seem to have decent 
<br>
education-witness all the programmers out of work. 
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;
<br>
<em>&gt; ***Well, without thinking of it too deeply when I wrote that, I was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking about people who hurt other people - committing rape, robbery, murder and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the like - but since then I've reconsidered.  Not all who go to prison do so 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to cause harm to others.  Even during my lifetime, I remember 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; several acquaintances of mine going to prison for civil rights and because of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their opposition to the Vietnam war.  Martin Luther King went to prison.  Thoreau.  Thomas 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Paine.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<p>You think robbers murders and rapists spend an inordinate time thinking about 
<br>
God and praying, before a crime? Again, the better-citizen issue has yet to 
<br>
be demonstrated either way. Let us agree that there are henious people who 
<br>
believe in God and do horrific crimes, and there are people who hold that there is 
<br>
no God, dieties, bad Ju-ju; and similarly commit evil acts. But let us also 
<br>
agree with Socrates, that an unexamined life is not worth living. So the 
<br>
dichotomy to which you seem to project on the religious, may be because you view 
<br>
them as non self reflective?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; ***Somewhat of a toss up.  But I'll go with Carl Sagan (who was a genuinely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sweet man, and with whom I shared a brief correspondence before he died) as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; he popularized science &quot;for the masses&quot; as none had done before him.  This 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was a great contribution, the effects of which we may yet see in years to come.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
We all have our favorite people, but my point was that someone who does 
<br>
believe, is a Nobel prize winner, and did contribute to technolgical progress-that 
<br>
is, if you do like lasers. You seem to be painting the religious with a broad 
<br>
brush, and that view does not seem to click with reality. Also, you seemed, in 
<br>
an earlier post to be annoyed by the mentioning of a 13 year, in response to 
<br>
a reporter's  question. He's 13 years old, he has a lot of learning to do, as 
<br>
do we all. Griping about his reference to the religious, seems to be 
<br>
counterproductive. And darn picky
<br>
too.
