There is a pretty good (I thought) article in the July 2003 Scientific
<br>
American describing challenges to traditional theories about how cells
<br>
turn cancerous.  The old idea is that it is due to an accumlation of
<br>
mutations, oncogenes which induce cancer being turned on, while cancer
<br>
suppressor genes are turned off.  However now that genetic assays are
<br>
possible against cancer tumors, this model isn't working that well.
<br>
<p>The new ideas focus on more general forms of genetic damage than
<br>
mutations.  The most radical one suggests that the first thing that goes
<br>
wrong is massive chromosomal damage.  When cells divide sometimes the
<br>
neat split of the chromosomes doesn't work, and the daughter cells end
<br>
up with missing or duplicated or hacked up chromosomes.  Usually this
<br>
kills them, but occasionally they survive.  At one stroke the behavior
<br>
of thousands of genes is changed massively.  From here on the cell is
<br>
not working as designed.  It has found its own path to survival, which
<br>
will often be erratic and unstable, making it much more susceptable to
<br>
further genetic damage.
<br>
<p>The problem is that observations of tumor cells often show disrupted
<br>
chromosomes and damaged genes, but which came first?  No one knows.
<br>
