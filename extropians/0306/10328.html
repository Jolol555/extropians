<a href="mailto:rhanson@gmu.edu?Subject=Re:%20Investing">rhanson@gmu.edu</a> writes: You have a much more basic question to address:  what makes you 
<br>
think you can do anything like a &quot;Buffet type investigation&quot;?  I'm quite sure 
<br>
that he has not completely revealed his investigation strategy.  Look at the vast 
<br>
numbers of traders who try to copy Buffet and fail.  How do you know you will 
<br>
succeed where they have failed?
<br>
<p>Robin,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once more you have asked a great question but once more I believe I 
<br>
have a partial answer -- heck, maybe it is a complete answer, you be the judge 
<br>
of that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, I do not have the the investigative power of Mr. Buffet.  But 
<br>
perhaps do I have sufficient investigative power to do the task I set myself.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been studying to prepare for pursuing my goals.  These days 
<br>
there seems to be enough information published to determine at what price a 
<br>
particular stock would be worth risking my money.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think one can compile a list of questions that expose a profile that 
<br>
say, not at any price.  I don't want high tech, companies without a ten year 
<br>
record of success, nor companies in highly competive markets.  Nor do I expect 
<br>
to find companies very often that are acceptable to me.  However I do have an 
<br>
advantage over Mr. Buffet.  I am strictly a small fry.  To continue meeting 
<br>
his goals he has to find an average of millions of dollars of worthy 
<br>
investments every year.  It will be years before I need an average of one tenth of one 
<br>
percent of that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for your questions,  I feel I have received thousands of 
<br>
dollars of advice for free.
<br>
Ron h.
