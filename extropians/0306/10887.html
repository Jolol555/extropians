<em>&gt; &gt; The psychological problem that most people have

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just on a silicon chip.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; A theme that probably should (and so probably has)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; been stressed by SF writers, and any of those of us
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; who engage in discussions with the unconverted, is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the attendant near-omniscience it would provide.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But this isn't a logical reply to the question.  Or did I misunderstand it?
</em><br>
<p>I'm not aware that I asked a question!?  What one are you thinking of?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Human beings are temporal dynamics of Shannon information in physical 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states.  Uploading makes absolutely no difference if the new substrate has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent dynamics and the uploading process preserves all functionally 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relevant information (in the Shannon sense) of the original to within 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thermal noise limits with no functionally relevant global bias.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but from the &quot;what's in it for me?&quot; parts of people's brains,
<br>
they really haven't been given much in terms of new capabilities.
<br>
Much of it comes across as fantasy or dreaming at best---whereas
<br>
I'm conjecturing that the &quot;how do thinks stand, what's really
<br>
happening to me?&quot; parts of the mind are unhappy with the prospect.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for near-omniscience, you can't do that without philosophically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nontrivial revision of sensory modalities.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but people may think of it as though it were simply
<br>
better optics.  And that's the way it would start: the
<br>
first visual impressions after uploading would be from
<br>
the POV of a robot, perhaps.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Uploading makes no disruption in the way that humans are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; woven into physics; it is  as philosophically trivial as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a sneeze.  You go through a larger discontinuity when you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fall asleep at night and wake up the next morning. Seriously.
</em><br>
<p>Well, something will have to go into their (equivalent)
<br>
sensory modalities, if it's done as you are saying.
