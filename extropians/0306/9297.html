<em>&gt; &gt; Excellent paper, Robert!  I have my browser set to prompt me on everything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so I can see what is happening, and reject/accept each item individually.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Some sites have no idea that they are sending literally dozens of cookies
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and loading dozens of scriptlets just to load their welcome screen.  No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wonder they are so slow.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely.  I sent a letter to KOMO TV here in Seattle a couple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of days ago because whatever editor they are using to create their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; web site is specifying alignments and fonts in *each* table cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (rather than a table row or even the entire table).  Very sloppy.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (rest of Robert's post at the bottom)
</em><br>
<p>But putting one for the row or the entire table isn't legal html, so
<br>
that would be worse (the font tag itself has been deprecated since
<br>
around 1997 but at least most browsers will work with the font tag in
<br>
each cell, putting a font tag around a whole table won't work on most
<br>
browsers) .  The &quot;standard&quot; (as in w3c standard) way to do it would be
<br>
using stylesheets, but then your seemingly favourite browser (Netscape
<br>
4.x) would not render it properly since it's one of the most standard
<br>
non-compliant browsers around.
<br>
In any case, web designers very rarely hand write, see, or even
<br>
understand their html.  It is 99% produced by tools, so if anyone should
<br>
be pressured then it should be the tool producers (eg Macromedia,
<br>
Microsoft)
<br>
Your assumption about the correlation of rendering times (below) accross
<br>
browsers doesn't always hold, especially if you are taking Netscrape 4.x
<br>
as your base, since that browser has severe problems with (tables inside
<br>
tables)^n, where n is bigger than around 6 or 7.  This situation is not
<br>
completely atypical among pages but Netscape's algorithm seems to be
<br>
polynomial to the nth so it tends to chug in a very ugly way in cases
<br>
where IE wouldn't even notice (btw, i don't use or like IE, but nothing
<br>
beats it for speed).
<br>
Cookies are almost harmless helping tools if implemented properly.  They
<br>
also make tracking on the id of a registered entity to a site practical
<br>
to use for most web developers.  Cookies mainly get a bad rep from bad
<br>
security on the browser side.
<br>
Scripts have a million helpful uses (validation on forms, hover help,
<br>
multi-select addition/deletion) and telling people to write less usable
<br>
sites so that browser writers can get away with weaker interpreter
<br>
implementations seems like overkill to me.  Switch to a different
<br>
browser and turn pop-ups off, and if you dislike the scrollers turn off
<br>
the time-interrupt functions too, but don't force the multi-hundred
<br>
million users to go through a submit, refresh to find out they forgot to
<br>
fill in the required &quot;state&quot; field at the bottom of the page.
<br>
(The funny thing is I agree with the sentiment of your post, it would be
<br>
good if pages where w3c compliant and they all went through html tidy
<br>
with no warnings, but your suggestions are the wrong option to me. 
<br>
Upgrade to IE 6/Mozilla/Opera/Netscape 7/Galeon/Konqueror/whatever, they
<br>
are newer, they are better, don't force designers to support the
<br>
brokenness of the Netscape 4.x/IE4 hell days)

<p><p><em>&gt; Perhaps someone (or preferably a several someones) should cruise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on over to the Mozilla web site and request &quot;enhancements&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the browser pages that make it clear in some bright red font
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the actual page size and the actual download time.  If one got
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Mozilla to add these it would create pressure on Microsoft, Opera,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc. to add the same features as well as put pressure on developers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make their pages &quot;cool&quot; by making them &quot;fast&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For example, I've noticed over the last several days that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nature web site (<a href="http://www.nature.com">http://www.nature.com</a>) has very long page display
</em><br>
<em>&gt; times in the old browser that I am using (Netscape 4.79).  But if its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slow in the old browsers, its probably slow in the new browsers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (from a comparitive standpoint).  Slower is *bad* -- it retards
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the progress of scientific learning, interaction, resolution of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; different opinions, etc.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In response to Harvey's meta-question regarding &quot;what are we doing?&quot; --
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can we complain to Nature in sufficient numbers that they actually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *fix* the damn website so it is fast rather than pretty?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One can get the customer service contact info here:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   <a href="http://nature.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/nature.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=9bPUKLKg&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_faqid=226&amp;p_created=1043771300&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MTExJnBfcGFnZT0y&amp;p_li">http://nature.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/nature.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_sid=9bPUKLKg&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_faqid=226&amp;p_created=1043771300&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MTExJnBfcGFnZT0y&amp;p_li</a></em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If one is a non-customer, then one can complain that the &quot;customers&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or former customers in my case) complain that the pages are poorly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; designed and take too long to display -- after all not everyone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has a Pentium 4 or uses IE 6.x.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is very easy for me to judge this on windows.  I simply have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the &quot;Windows Task Manager&quot; running (but minimized) most of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and watch the degree of CPU usage when I am doing something.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When I open a Nature page in a browser the CPU pegs at 50%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; activity (its a dual CPU machine and most browsers are single
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threaded) and it stays there for many seconds until the page
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually displays.  Has to be poor page design.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course the same applies to loading many cookies or scripts as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harvey points out.  Such is a sign of either (a) careless page design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or (b) seeking to control of the downstream computer in some way.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is needed is better feedback tools so one can place pressure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on website designers to clean up their acts.
