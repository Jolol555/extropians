<em>&gt; &lt;&lt;I don't think this situation has a tidy solution; nor a quick one, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; apart from the Albigensian approach (&quot;Kill them all; God will know his 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own&quot;, in the apocryphal wording). This is grievous.&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My sense is that this policy is not kin to some medieval monk's view of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the world and human interaction.
</em><br>
<p>The apocryphal quote in question was alleged to be from someone empowered 
<br>
with a general's authority.
<br>
<p>The CIC of the US is a devout Christian.
<br>
<p>While I don't make a great deal out of this, the way a lot of Euro press 
<br>
and some on this list do, I think it's no exaggeration to say that if one 
<br>
believes one is doing God's will, certain thoughts can come to mind that 
<br>
are not available to agnostics or atheists. &quot;God forgive me for the death 
<br>
of innocents&quot; being one; the above being a hypertrophied version of that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Rather, this is a cold-blooded analysis of what our opponents say, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to believe, and act upon. Denial of civilizational differences will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not stand the light of day. Its not simply what we or you, MMB want, it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what the other fellows tell each other, as Claude Shannon, said decades 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ago.
</em><br>
<p>I decline at present to frame a point-for-point response to your triple 
<br>
(not double) post. However:
<br>
<p>You seem to think I think things I do not.
<br>
<p>One heuristic of mine is &quot;The problem is '&quot;the&quot; problem is...'&quot;.
<br>
<p>One way to unpack this is, &quot;The tendency of people to boil complex 
<br>
situations down to mind-sized chunks by excluding things until there's just 
<br>
one thing that needs doing creates problems--often by jumping to a 
<br>
conclusion; and this fact is frequently the problem that I judge to be the 
<br>
biggest problem-creating factor in human situations, myself.&quot;
<br>
<p>I do agree that a war between cultures (or civilizations, if you will) 
<br>
might be ensuing. I do prefer (many parts of) mine, and would take 
<br>
personal, possibly violent, action to defend same--but there the issue 
<br>
becomes slightly more complex than a &quot;THE PROBLEM&quot; analysis can cover.
<br>
<p>There is a &quot;wicked&quot; (intractable) element here, in that &quot;dissuasion&quot; 
<br>
actions can act in the opposite direction of &quot;persuasion&quot; actions, and vice 
<br>
versa. Does &quot;culture war&quot; trump such concerns? Maybe. Sometimes. For those 
<br>
who already get what I'm saying, skip past the next marked segment for my 
<br>
concluding remarks.
<br>
<p>&lt;Exegesis=PARTIAL&gt;
<br>
<p>My *cold-blooded* analysis of regrettable factors include:
<br>
<p>-If NO military action is taken when called for, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If military action is/was taken and bystanders become more polarized, 
<br>
grievous.
<br>
<p>-If grasping abusive shortsighted people subjugate others, grievous-- 
<br>
whether they're thug-protected corporations or simple gun-bearing thugs.
<br>
<p>-If Iraq collapses into Shi'ite Shariya, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If the actions taken by the US contribute to instability, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If the US uses such instability to justify further incursions (&quot;Hey, look, 
<br>
we tried, but them camel jockeys just aren't ready for anything but 
<br>
subjugaton...&quot;) with a further net bad effect, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If those who claim to speak for the US continue to spin, oversimplify and 
<br>
misrepresent things, grievous.
<br>
<p>-If the media continue to pump up the US population as easily spooked 
<br>
fragile victims, grievous.
<br>
<p>&lt;/Exegesis&gt;
<br>
<p>That a thing might be inevitable doesn't make it a happy thing. And they 
<br>
might still play happy music at the end. I'm not handwringing here. One can 
<br>
grieve with a rifle in one's hands.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this respect, this conflict is just like WW3, also known as the Cold 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; War.
</em><br>
<p>Optimist.
