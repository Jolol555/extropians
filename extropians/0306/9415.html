<a href="mailto:pfallon@ptd.net?Subject=Re:%20neocons%20(WAS%20IRAQ:%20Weapons%20of%20Mass%20Delusion">pfallon@ptd.net</a> writes:A shorthand summary of PNAC strategies that have become U.S. 
<br>
policy[*]: 
<br>
&nbsp;[*] excerpted from A PNAC Primer by Bernard Weiner 
<br>
<p>Pat, 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what you have really given us is the work of Barnard Weiner, a 
<br>
social psychologist in California that according to the Google search I did is a 
<br>
writer of so called political analysis attacking the US.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your contribution seems to have been the statement that, &quot;And they 
<br>
have been remarkably successful in seeing it implemented.  They should be proud 
<br>
[instead of suddenly disowning the &quot;neo-con&quot; label]...they did exactly what 
<br>
they said they were going to do.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you have not proven, I don't believe, is that they ever used the 
<br>
the term Neo Conservative to any extent at all.  So you seem to be begging the 
<br>
question when you allege they have disown the neo-con label.  How can anyone 
<br>
disown what they never owned. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The important thing seems to be that today when I read the terms &quot;neo 
<br>
con&quot; &quot;neo conservative&quot; &quot;Extreme right wing of the Republican Party,&quot; &quot;Leo 
<br>
Strauss&quot; I am sure to be reading an attack made by some one on the left wing that 
<br>
never reveal their own affilliations.  Strauss in particular seems to be a 
<br>
popular straw man to be used in these attacks.   That is interesting in that 
<br>
even so sketchy a reading of Strauss as mine reveals that Strauss has been stood 
<br>
on his head by so called analysts.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I do appreciate you alerting me that Mr. Wolfowitz and others at 
<br>
the third level of our government (or below) are the puppet masters pulling the 
<br>
strings on George Bush.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me add to your information.  You have missed a major part of the 
<br>
Republican's nefarious plan to take over the government.  As the plan and 
<br>
planners have been in all the papers it is hard to imagine how you missed them -- 
<br>
never the less you did miss them in your monologue.  The overthrow of the 
<br>
Democrat House of Representatives was engineered by Newt Gingrich, Dick Armey, 
<br>
etal.  Can you imagine Wolfowitz, Strauss and others succeeding in their attempt 
<br>
without a Republican Congress to build on?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition I most sincerely believe that Reagan did not bring down 
<br>
the Soviet Union it collapsed of its own weight.  Not only that but the Congress 
<br>
in 1994 wasn't won by Gingrich so much as it was lost by Clinton.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Obviously that indicates that the group of Republican Skullduggers 
<br>
that you mistakingly call the Neo Cons had a pipeline into the top levels of the 
<br>
Soviet leadership as well as the Clinton Whitehouse.  Somehow you have missed 
<br>
the Skull and Bones Society up at Yale and also Trotsky's role.  Do they come 
<br>
in at this point?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously I think you gentlemen have gone off the deep end and 
<br>
unwittingly ended up in comedy.
<br>
Ron h.
