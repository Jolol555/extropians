<p>
In my opinion one of the major factors that turned the rural Thai people 
<br>
off of the commie doctrine was the provision of a wide network of ROADs 
<br>
linking their villages to other centers of population.
<br>
<p>Remember, early '60s not all that much rural electrification in NE 
<br>
Thailand, virtually no TV, not very good distribution of newspapers and 
<br>
magazines outside the main towns.  The real rural population didn't see 
<br>
much in the way of government services and much of what they saw was 
<br>
corrupt (like now).  What they often heard was groups of well trained and 
<br>
motivated commie agitators agitating against the government and then 
<br>
promising a bright future once true commie led &quot;democracy&quot; triumphed.
<br>
<p>Starting about 1956 USAID (USOM at the time), came into Thailand and one of 
<br>
the major projects was ROADS, big ones, like the Friendship Highway, and 
<br>
smaller dirt ones, too, all over the place.
<br>
<p>Previously the rural dirt farmer raised his few crops, ate most, perhaps 
<br>
had a small surplus available for sale, but no way to move it to 
<br>
market.  His village might of had a school, no electricity, no med clinic, 
<br>
perhaps a cop, lucky to have a small store, didn't have much of anything.
<br>
<p>Along came the road punching through, brought communication with the 
<br>
outside world, newspapers, more goodies for sale in the local store, an 
<br>
incentive to raise a few more veggies for sale, since they could be moved 
<br>
to market, a medic for the clinic, more stuff.
<br>
<p>Along with all this, too, came corruption, but that could be dealt with, 
<br>
just raise some more veggies.  What it brought was an end to the agitator's 
<br>
promises of paradise that hadn't come to pass, a minor level of prosperity 
<br>
was at hand, through the current government.  People stopped listening to 
<br>
the agitators and joined the  village level capitalist society.
<br>
<p>The commies were still around in the woods through the end of the '70s, 
<br>
agitating away but not gaining much ground.  What really knocked them out 
<br>
was General Chavalit's policy of an amnesty for all who turned in their 
<br>
guns and rejoined society.  This of course, before Chavalit went ga ga and 
<br>
got into politics.
<br>
<p>The amnesty program worked.  Do remember one occasion about 1981 when about 
<br>
3,000 former CT turned themselves in at Mukdahan, a grand ceremony for 
<br>
them, and a real amnesty.
<br>
<p>So, let's hear it for rural roads!!!

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;an island of freedom within the Southeast Asia empire they were trying to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;establish?  I can't imagine that.  They may have published statements that 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;General Giap has said he had no intention of making Khe Sahn the American 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Dien Bien Phu.  Note that he said that after he was forced to withdraw and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not when the outcome of the siege remained in doubt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe it's in Air Commando One about General Aderholt that some of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;detailed information is provided about Bill Lair coming into Thailand in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;the early 1960s and organizing the Thai anti-insurgency forces.  The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;providing of American helicopters to the Thai forces was a key to mobility 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that helped the Thai forces counter the insurgents.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Certainly a communist takeover of Thailand would have been more of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;challenge than in places like old French Indochina.  A study of earlier 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;history shows that Thailand was kept as a buffer state between the British 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;empire on the west and the French empire on the east.  So the Thai people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hadn't been a colony with the accompanying underpinings of anti-colonial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;resentment that emerged in South/Southeast Asia after World War II.  And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as most of us know, the Thai king was highly revered by most of the Thai 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I believe that if there had been little or no American effort against the
