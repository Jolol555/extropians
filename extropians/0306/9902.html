<p>I think &quot;the natural laws of rhetoric&quot; need to be based on psychology as
<br>
well as game theory. A group of agents exchanging pieces of information
<br>
does only explain a small subset of the interactions of rhetoric. These
<br>
abstract agents simply have no (defined) emotionality and motivations,
<br>
making them too general to say much about human rhetoric (they can still
<br>
have interesting disagreements and ethical interactions). They have the
<br>
logos and likely ethos of the old &quot;Logos, ethos, pathos&quot; formula, but
<br>
lack the pathos part. 
<br>
<p>If we add some emotional hard/soft-ware to them, things become 
<br>
interesting. A simple model would be that humans have an arousal level 
<br>
that determines the likeliehood of using a previously used or learned 
<br>
response rather than finding a new or trying something different (in 
<br>
reinforcement learning this would correspond to the temperature of the 
<br>
softmax action selection). Arousal have a clear evolutionary benefit, 
<br>
since in a crisis situation (core values such as own life in danger) 
<br>
usually fast well-trained action rather than slow introspection is 
<br>
rewarded in nature (at least *our* nature - might make an interesting sf 
<br>
story to set up an ecosystem with an opposing situation). 
<br>
<p>This carries over into the discussions of the agents: when their core
<br>
values are threatened, arousal goes up and their responses become more
<br>
predictable and stimulus-response rather than creative. This means that
<br>
overall information production goes down, and this is in itself bad
<br>
enough. But as an additional psychological assumption, if we add
<br>
aggression (the deliberate threat of important values) as something that
<br>
is made more likely by high (negative) arousal, then it is clear why we
<br>
also get a vicious circle in the discussion when the arousal goes up.
<br>
The only way to avoid it if the basic arousal/aggression mechanism is
<br>
unchangeable is to use cognitive tricks to insulate the discussion from
<br>
arousal increases. 
<br>
<p><p>Other laws of rhetoric likely stem from cognitive effects, such as
<br>
primacy and recency (putting emphasis on the beginning and end pays), as
<br>
well as the von Restorff effect showing why occasional surprises are 
<br>
well recalled and increase attention at the expense of surrounding 
<br>
material.
