<p>
The strongest argument that I have not yet heard here:
<br>
<p>&quot;Is this as good as it gets?&quot;
<br>
<p>WHY would anyone in their right mind, much less an SI,
<br>
waste clock cycles simulating our miserable state of
<br>
existence?  Can't any one of you think of a zillion
<br>
different, more interesting universes to live in? 
<br>
Would YOU choose to simulate a single-celled piece of
<br>
self-replicating proto-life, other than to answer some
<br>
scientific question?  Is there some question that can
<br>
only be answered by an SI by simulating 21st Century
<br>
Earth, down to our miserable crawling state of
<br>
consciousness?
<br>
<p>Or, for another take:
<br>
<p>Let's say you are a master programmer, programming is
<br>
your life, it's all you want to do, and your basic
<br>
physical needs are taken care of for your expected
<br>
lifespan, so you can devote your entire life to
<br>
programming. But all you have is a Commodore 64.  That
<br>
C64 could handle all kinds of trivial problems in an
<br>
eyeblink, but those aren't of interest.  The
<br>
satisfaction of building a tic-tac-toe solver is
<br>
fleeting and afterwards you feel a letdown.  What you
<br>
really want is a problem that will take all your
<br>
resources - time and processing power - and use them
<br>
in the most effective possible way, so that the last
<br>
instant of your existence will coincide with the final
<br>
output of the C64.
<br>
<p>Now upgrade that to an SI who has the life cycle of
<br>
the universe to work in.  Will the SI spend clock
<br>
cycles creating some protoplasmoid trivial simulation
<br>
of paradise with the 70 perpetual virgins?  There are
<br>
natural limits to computational power - speed of
<br>
light, Heisenburg uncertainty, physical mass of the
<br>
universe, etc.  Won't the SI look for the most
<br>
difficult problem and devote everything to it?  
<br>
<p>Isn't it kind of a  stretch to imagine this SI taking
<br>
time out to simulate US?
