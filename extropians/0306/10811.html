</em><br>
<p>The &quot;forcing&quot; of labels is to prevent a bigger, messier sequence of
<br>
events: companies selling foods without labels, people (as it was
<br>
suggested) setting up labs for analyzing food and publishing reports,
<br>
companies suing those labs for misleading information, special interest
<br>
groups lobbying for this and that, and consumers that do not know what to
<br>
do. It's something like the lesser of evils. Complete, in-depth labels
<br>
would not only settle the GM arguments, but also provide benefits in other
<br>
ways, for example the plethora of chemical additives.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Forget GM, if people are worried about the food supply they should
</em><br>
<em>&gt;demonstrate against the huge amount of antibiotics injected into
</em><br>
<em>&gt;millions of cows and chickens that helps bacteria develop resistance to
</em><br>
<em>&gt;those drugs; and also complain about the unsanitary and unusual culinary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;practices in China that gave us SARS and many varieties of influenza.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;There is little doubt those two things have killed people, lots and lots
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of people, GM food almost certainly never hurt anybody.
</em><br>
<p>I agree, but those are independent issues. Protesting one does not mean
<br>
accepting another one.
<br>
<p>Some years ago, Europe was shocked by the &quot;mad cow&quot; disease. Nevermind
<br>
that the public fear was orders of magnitude higher than needed (and I was
<br>
happily buying steaks at half the price). After that incident, most meat
<br>
products here have a label that says where and how the animal was raised.
<br>
Of course only in general terms, but again, I see that as a step in the
<br>
good direction.
<br>
