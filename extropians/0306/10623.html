</em><br>
<p>So suppose I was negotiating with you to buy your used car, and I 
<br>
want to verify that you're not hiding any problems with the car from me, 
<br>
I'd ask a super-AI to read your mind? Wouldn't it be a lot easier just to 
<br>
have the super-AI build a new car for me? Or better yet, have the AI 
<br>
construct a nanotech body for me that can travel faster than any car. :)
<br>
<p>The point is, if we need super-AIs to detect lying or self-deception, then 
<br>
there can be no economics argument for secrets going away.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As far as the issue of keeping secrets that Wei raised, there might be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; few possible solutions.  One would be to create an AI which would read
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your mind, report on your truthfulness, and then self-destruct.  Or,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given such an AI program, in principle you could use a crypto algorithm,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a zero knowledge proof, to show that your brain state would satisfy the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; AI program, without actually running it.
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how you could do this with zero knowledge proof techniques. As
<br>
far as I know, in order to do a zero knowledge proof of anything you have
<br>
to construct a conventional proof of it first. Zero knowledge only lets
<br>
you convince someone else that a conventional proof exists without having
<br>
to show it to him. Maybe you mean generalized secure multiparty
<br>
computation instead? But in that case the AI is still run, it's just that
<br>
the execution is encrypted and shared between several parties.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Another possibility would be to standardize on mental architectures which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a fairly strict separation between the motivational structure and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certain kinds of factual knowledge.  Then you could expose the one part
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but keep the other secret, and the mind reader could be confident that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the secret data would not have a significant impact.  However I'm not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sure it makes sense to keep secrets but somehow to have them be unable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to affect your motivations.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that whatever economic pressure exists towards
<br>
standardizing on verifiable mental architectures will apply much more
<br>
towards standardizing on motivations. A group of agents with the same
<br>
mental architecture and different motivations faces huge disadvantages
<br>
when competing with a group of agents with a variety of mental
<br>
architectures and the same motivations. The latter group can optimize
<br>
their mental architectures for efficiency and specialization, rather than
<br>
verifiability.
