</em><br>
<em>&gt; I personally can accept this as a strong argument for seeking truth.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (And I even once had this argument in my self-deception paper.)  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for most audiences, this is a very weak argument.  And my original
</em><br>
<em>&gt; claim was just that I could only find disappointingly weak arguments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for believing truth.
</em><br>
<p>### The strength of an argument seems to be a function of both the argument
<br>
and the mind it is directed at. So whether an argument is strong will depend
<br>
on whether it is applied to rational minds, or strength as applied to
<br>
irrational (e.g. evolutionarily programmed to self-deceive and to fall for
<br>
certain salient ideas, like religion) minds. In the latter case, indeed
<br>
arguments for the truth might be fall on deaf ears. But then, if you choose
<br>
your target appropriately, any argument will be as weak or as strong as you
<br>
wish. The only limitation is that certain minds tend not to survive in our
<br>
environment too long, so certain arguments are likely to remain weak because
<br>
of the rarity of appropriate targets.
<br>
<p>It's also useful to differentiate between consistent and temporary
<br>
self-deception. In the former case, all traces of truth are erased. In the
<br>
latter, truth is temporarily suppressed, allowing lying. I would venture
<br>
that the vast majority of social self-deception is temporary - it makes
<br>
sense to believe the girlfriend-lie while trying to obtain a sexual favor,
<br>
but not when choosing a long-term mate. If you really make yourself believe
<br>
a sub-par girlfriend is a great choice, you will damage your reproduction
<br>
potential. Most people believe their self-deceptions with a part of their
<br>
mind only. The truth is almost always there, hidden under the surface.
<br>
<p>For me, the arguments for truth-seeking presented by Eliezer, Dan, Hal, and
<br>
Emlyn, are compelling. I have an instrumental approach to large parts of my
<br>
own goal system, and this reduces the level of reliance on evolutionary
<br>
programming. In the Singularitarian future I will have to know the truth
<br>
about self and the world, to avoid damage to my goal system as a result of
<br>
manipulation of self (this is in a way quite analogous to the problem facing
<br>
the FAI during transformation - how to grow rather than replace itself with
<br>
something else). I do not know if in the long run there could be situations
<br>
where self-deceiving minds would have a stable and significant survival
<br>
advantage over truth-seekers. The paper Robin quoted
<br>
(<a href="http://econpapers.hhs.se/paper/cwlcwldpp/1319.htm">http://econpapers.hhs.se/paper/cwlcwldpp/1319.htm</a>) seems to imply
<br>
otherwise. For now I will wait and see. Only when I see as an empirical fact
<br>
that a mind can lie to itself, live forever and beat the Bayesian market
<br>
competition, would I consider switching to the dark side.
