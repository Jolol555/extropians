<em>&gt; &gt;Must one be on Extropy's board to call themselves an extropian?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I shouldn't think so, but then I'm not an extropian. By the way, it was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *you* who introduced the unpleasant phrase `the kind of twisted ethics
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prevalent on the extropy board'. I'll draw your questions to the attention
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of several members of the Board.
</em><br>
<p>I do apologize for confusing the term 'board' it was clear now to me that
<br>
Damien meant the Board as in Greg, Natasha, etc and not the board, as in
<br>
this mailing list.  The board with the little b was what I was referring to
<br>
initially.
<br>
<p>But the point remains, the ethics demonstrated in posts by members of this
<br>
mailing list still surprises me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;I was referring to your ethics... or at least
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;the statement you have made that hinted toward your ethical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principles.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;have not found these particular ethical concepts of 'it is more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immoral the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;more it effects me' and 'removing a murderous tyrant is morally as bad as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;being a murderous tyrant'
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Inverted commas in this context imply that these are quotations and that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have made those statements. I did not. Don't do that again.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>The former is a paraphrase of your moral principles stated in previous
<br>
discussions, the later is a paraphrase of Emlyn's.  You did not make that
<br>
direct statement, but made ones that directly implied that.
<br>
<p>Anyhoo, you still didnt answer the questions I posed.
<br>
<p>I shall ask again
<br>
<p>Damien said:
<br>
<em>&gt; When I hear that Saddam and his sons and regime tortured and murdered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, I am horrified; when I hear that US jails contain a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; million or more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prisoners many of them incarcerated for using marijuana and subjected in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prison to rampant rape and brutality, I am horrified as well.
</em><br>
<p>...but are you equally horrified? !!!!!!!!
<br>
<p>Are you seriously suggesting it is equally deplorable that humans beings are
<br>
being raped, murdered, and tortured as you find human beings spending a few
<br>
months in climate controlled prison watching survivor, weight lifting and
<br>
reading Playboy in a post industrialized west nation living longer healther
<br>
better lives than perhaps 3/4's of the world?
<br>
<p>So, which is it, is it more wrong to rape and murder someone (albiet,
<br>
someone you dont know) or more wrong to toss a pot smoking youth in jail?
<br>
<p>Accordingly, which are you morally required to voice objections to?  The one
<br>
you have more control over, or the one that is more wrong (if, indeed, you
<br>
feel one is actually more wrong than the other)
<br>
<p>Further, is Saddam Hussain morally culpable for the deaths of the civilians
<br>
in the Coalition lead effort to remove said murderous tyrant from power, or
<br>
is the coalition morally culpable?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
