</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>This makes a lot of sense at first glance.  But is it right?  Is the limiting factor of current AI really that the computers are underpowered?  If that were the case, I would expect AI to work fine, but be really slow.  Then increasing computer power would get the AI up to speed.  But as I understand it, the problem is not speed or power.  The problem is that AI programs still don't make the right decisions much of the time.  Faster computers won't help them work better.  They will merely perform the current failures faster.  I think improvements for AI have nothing to do with hardware.  I think they will be software and methodology based.
