Extropes,

<em>&gt; Coming from the man who said &quot;the good guys won&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about Vietnam.  4 million deaths and 30 million
</em><br>
enslaved people later, you still think 'the good guys
<br>
&nbsp;won'.
<br>
<p>Your &quot;facts&quot; are the invention of your ideology.  An
<br>
exaggeration of a fabrication.  This is your
<br>
dishonesty which insults others and violates the
<br>
principles of good faith discussion.  Lies, like the
<br>
&quot;Hue Massacre&quot; and the &quot;Gulf of Tonkin Incident&quot;;
<br>
lies, pure and simple.  
<br>
<p>The truth? Three million deaths caused by the French,
<br>
the Americans, and their respective puppets.  No
<br>
&quot;enslavement&quot; by the communists, just a different form
<br>
of government facing the difficult task of rebuilding
<br>
a country savaged by 124 years of foreign
<br>
dictatorships, and made all the more difficult by the
<br>
opposition of the political elite of the world's
<br>
richest and most powerful country.  An elite filled
<br>
with hostility by their defeat at the hands of a
<br>
people with the brains, discipline, and courage to pay
<br>
the enormous price required to &quot;refuse&quot; the tyranny of
<br>
foreign dictators.  And since you're so fond of the
<br>
question when it suits your purpose--childish as it
<br>
is--both your question and your purpose--&quot;What gave
<br>
THEM the right to be dictators?!&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I note on the extropian principles 3.0 that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Supporting social orders that foster freedom of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; speech, freedom of action,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and experimentation. Opposing authoritarian social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; control and favoring the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rule of law and decentralization of power.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since the opposite of what this particular entry in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the extropian principles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is an accurate description of the current communist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government in Vietnam,
</em><br>
<p>Again, a fabrication of your ideology.  A lie which
<br>
begs the question.  
<br>
<p>To dishonesty, add incoherent logic.  Your premises
<br>
must be based on fact.  Then, your conclusions must
<br>
follow from your premises.  No fact, no premise.  No
<br>
premise, no conclusion.  The noisy emptiness of
<br>
ideological fantasy --dishonesty really, as you
<br>
willfully refuse the obligation--the moral obligation,
<br>
the ethical obligation--of truthfulness.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wonder how you can both consider yourself an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian and have considered
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 'good guys' to have won in that conflict.
</em><br>
<p>As you rightly note no one has the RIGHT to be a
<br>
dictator.  No one has the right to take massive
<br>
military forces halfway around the globe to be the
<br>
dictator over people who want to rule themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps you do not consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yourself an extropian? 
</em><br>
<p>I was an extropian/transhumanist before there were
<br>
extropians/transhumanists.  But that is no matter.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or, another option, perhaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you do feel that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Vietnam communist government fosters free speech and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposes authoritarian social control?
</em><br>
<p>All governments have laws for the maintenance of
<br>
social order.  Freedom of speech has its limitations. 
<br>
I may not cry &quot;fire!&quot; in a crowded theater, nor
<br>
advocate the violent overthrow of the US government. 
<br>
Communists (and their subsequent governments), under
<br>
siege by the capitalists from before the ink was dry
<br>
on the &quot;Manifesto&quot;, feel the need to protect
<br>
themselves from foreign subversion--
<br>
<p>&quot;Make the Chilean economy scream.&quot; said Nixon to
<br>
Kissinger, before ordering him to destroy their
<br>
democracy in favor of a brutal DICTATORSHIP. As the
<br>
Dulles boys had done before them to Iran and Guatemala
<br>
and countless others.  And again, your question: WHAT
<br>
GAVE THEM THE RIGHT?!
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;--by suppressing dissent and political competition. 
<br>
Not the American tradition, for sure, but neither
<br>
uncommon nor necessarily the demon evil that your
<br>
ideological psychosis screams in your head and out
<br>
into the world.  It is easy to pass judgment on
<br>
others. But that judgment, informed only by the
<br>
passionate animus of ideological fantasy is a
<br>
&quot;twisted&quot; cartoon of genuine, thoughtful ethical
<br>
practice.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; If you can not defend your political viewpoints to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; criticisms, either dont
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make them, or dont attack those who feel they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deserve criticism.  Opposing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; points of view deserve an audience.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Arf, arf&quot; says my dog.  But he's a dog, what's your
<br>
excuse?  Puleeese.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Additionally, I have made contributions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; non-political to the extropy list,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but even if I had not, so what?  Politics only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussers are not forbidden,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and there is no quota of non-politcal discussions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required, nor any criteria
</em><br>
<em>&gt; required to meet.  Do you suggest that matters of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politics not important to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropian interests?  I would argue that they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far more important than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 90% of what is discussed on this list 
</em><br>
<p>I certainly agree that political discussions are valid
<br>
and important, and I'd like to explore, both as
<br>
contributor and listener, a variety of political
<br>
questions.  But not with you.  You're just not
<br>
qualified.  You refuse the discipline, effort,
<br>
responsibility, and you lack the skill--and it seems
<br>
the inclination--to track down information and
<br>
evaluate it to extract fact, to distinguish truth from
<br>
lies.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
(e.g. what
<br>
<em>&gt; would you ask god if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; saw him) And when people of this list endorse
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ethical principles that are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly NOT extropian, or consider governments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that could not be any more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-extropian as 'good guys' I feel it vitally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important to make my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; political points.
</em><br>
<p>You HAVE no political points to make.  You think you
<br>
do, but you are misinformed.  You have no capacity or
<br>
inclination to distinguish fact from fantasy.  You
<br>
have no logical coherence with which to process the
<br>
non-inventory of facts (or inventory of non-facts).   
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Interesting to note that those who tend to disagree
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with you are the ones
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you draw the analogy to a dog barking loudly on all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fours.  Coincidence?
</em><br>
<p>John Clark disagrees with me, and I with him, but his
<br>
name is not mentioned in my &quot;dog&quot; list.  Lee Corbin
<br>
disagrees with me, and I with him, but his name ain't
<br>
there either.  You accused Damien B and Harvey N of
<br>
&quot;twisted ethics&quot;, and did it stupidly.  That put you
<br>
over the top.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Further, Jeff, I wonder if you consider anyone to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have the *right* to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dictator.  I suspect you, just like everyone else,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will refuse to answer.
</em><br>
<p>I've already answered it.  I don't know why others
<br>
haven't jumped on it before now.  Perhaps they're
<br>
embarrassed.  Embarrassed because it's a stupid
<br>
question.  Embarrassed that you're such a simpleton to
<br>
ask it.  Of course, no one has the **right** to be a
<br>
dictator.  But so what!  There's no rhetorical trap
<br>
here.  You make no great--or small--point.  No one is
<br>
thinking, &quot;Oh wow! Michael Dikey's got me good now. 
<br>
Ouch, I'm busted.&quot;
<br>
<p>No one has the right to be a Dictator.
<br>
<p>So the fuck what.  Setting aside contextually relevant
<br>
(and quite interesting) issues regarding the nature of
<br>
rights, and the freedom of action of sovereign
<br>
geopolitical actors compared to ordinary folks (who
<br>
are compelled to live within systems where there are
<br>
laws and &quot;rights&quot;, and authorities to enforce and
<br>
protect these, respectively, and with varying degrees
<br>
of fidelity)---setting these aside, one can guess that
<br>
you're getting at something---one has to guess,
<br>
because you don't say it bluntly.  I think it is this:
<br>
&nbsp;No one has the right to be a dictator, Saddam is a
<br>
dictator, therefore George Bush has the right (if not
<br>
the duty) to make war on Saddam to end his
<br>
dictatorship.  
<br>
<p>Hogwash!  This fatuous &quot;logic&quot; reduces the entire
<br>
issue of the legitimacy of war to: if someone is a
<br>
brutal Dictator, then whoever might happen to feel
<br>
like it, or feels ethically compelled to do so, has 
<br>
the right to go to war, presumably against the
<br>
military, the regime, and, if they resist, the entire 
<br>
country of the Dictator.
<br>
<p>Michael, the issue is vastly more complex than that. 
<br>
There are waves of implications that spread out across
<br>
the planet, threatening dire consequences for everyone
<br>
on the planet.  History clearly shows the enormous
<br>
suffering that can result.  Mature, decent,
<br>
clear-headed, serious people know that. IT IS FOR THAT
<br>
REASON that the rest of the world objected to the war.
<br>
IT IS FOR THAT REASON that the rest of the world is
<br>
scared shitless. The most powerful military machine
<br>
the world has ever seen, is in the hands of a regime
<br>
that feels free to make endless preemptive war, led by
<br>
an intellectually-challenged, decisive (read: cowboy),
<br>
lipless, ex-drunk and his war-is-the-answer cabal, who
<br>
think everyone in the world should comply with
<br>
American &quot;guidance&quot;.
<br>
<p>We may have avoided disaster this time.  May have. 
<br>
Getting rid of Saddam is certainly a good thing. 
<br>
Hoorah!  I don't think anyone disputes that.  But what
<br>
about next time?  Or the time after that?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;------------------------
<br>
<p>Write what you will, Michael.  The list is free and
<br>
open.  As for me, I'm trying real hard to exercise a
<br>
certain discipline.  The discipline to refrain from
<br>
responding to you until such time as you get much
<br>
better at thinking about such matters.  
<br>
<p>Good luck.       
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;There is only one basic human right, the right to do
<br>
as you damn well please. And with it comes the only
<br>
basic human duty, the duty to take the consequences.&quot;
