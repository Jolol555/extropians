(Please disregard my prior email on this thread; my
<br>
ISP
<br>
decided not to inform me of the other emails saying
<br>
what I said until after I'd sent it.)

<em>&gt; 1) I believe the end of the Apollo project was due

</em><br>
<p>Public interest in the national goal, perhaps, but not
<br>
at personal levels.  &quot;Okay, the U.S.A. has been to the
<br>
Moon.  Now, when do *I* get to go?  Never?  Forget
<br>
that.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2) All these aerospace engineers are as good at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic estimates as I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; am-which is to say-negative.
</em><br>
<p>The more serious ones have hired financial advisers
<br>
who aren't quite so poor at this.  A number of them
<br>
think the engineers are being too conservative.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what is my answer? Breakthroughs, in engineering,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; materials science, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical engineering, biological apps. Fund these,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; habitation will follow. Let the be underfunded, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we as a species will wait 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the decades it will take to achieve these advances,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that comes from scientific 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pursuits, in the typical hap-hazzard way.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, the necessary breakthroughs - in avionics,
<br>
rocket fuels, materials, and so forth - have been made
<br>
over the past few decades, albeit mostly in slow
<br>
evolutionary fashion rather than point breakthroughs.
<br>
It's just that Big Aerospace sees more profit in
<br>
charging NASA more for yesterday's technology, and
<br>
NASA keeps justifying this logic.  (One might almost
<br>
suspect the NASA managers were getting financial
<br>
kickbacks, if the psychology of beauracracies did not
<br>
provide a simpler explanation.)
<br>
<p>Several smaller companies are now seeking to fill the
<br>
gap, though.  Their biggest problem - at least, the
<br>
ones that are actually flying hardware (the rest are
<br>
flying dreams) - is funding, being smaller companies.
