Hal :
<br>
<em>&gt; What are &quot;the very conditions which define the possible types of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; predictions&quot;?  Isn't this phrase the same as &quot;the experimental setup&quot;?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is, it is the experimental setup which defines the possible types
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of predictions which can be made.  It is the setup which determines
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether you are measuring position or momentum.  It is the setup which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determines whether you detect which slit a particle went through in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; two slit experiment.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, Bohr is referring to the possibility of &quot;an influence on [the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experimental setup&quot; as a resolution to the EPR paradox.  But what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determines the experimental setup?  It is the decision by the scientist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the experimenter, about what to measure.  Bohr's words, taken literally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; imply that he is describing an influence on the decision of what to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; measure.  That is, our choice of what to measure is not free, but is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow influenced by the non-local correlations. [...]
</em><br>
<p>Bohr wrote two different (obscure) things, about EPR.
<br>
<p>In 1935 (Nature, 136, p. 65) he wrote 
<br>
&quot;It is true that in the measurement under consideration
<br>
any direct mechanical interaction of the [second] system and the 
<br>
measuring agencies is excluded, but a closer examination reveals 
<br>
that the procedure of measurements has an essential influence 
<br>
on the conditions on which the very definition of the physical 
<br>
quantities in question rests.&quot;
<br>
<p>And later, in 1935 (Physical Review, 48, p. 696) he wrote, i.e. 
<br>
&quot;there is ... no question of a mechanical disturbance of the 
<br>
system under investigation ... [but] there is essentially the 
<br>
question of an influence on the very conditions which define 
<br>
the possible types of predictions regarding the future behavior 
<br>
of the system.&quot; And he also wrote &quot; ... we are not dealing with
<br>
an incomplete description characterized by the arbitrary picking
<br>
out of different elements of reality at the cost of sacrificing
<br>
other such elements, but with a rational discrimination between
<br>
essentially different experimental arrangements and procedures...&quot;
<br>
<p>Now, there are, imho, several possible interpretations. I.e.:
<br>
- The choice on the left side (of a EPR setup)does have an influence
<br>
on the condition that defines what happens (in the future) on the 
<br>
right side;
<br>
- The choice on the left side (of a EPR setup)does have an influence
<br>
on the condition that defines the meaning of (the counterfactual
<br>
statement about) what might have happened (in the past) on the 
<br>
right side; that is to say that performing one of the earlier 
<br>
possible measurements excludes the possibility of performing
<br>
an alternative possible one;
<br>
- There is an action-at-a-distance (in Bohrian terms, an &quot;influence&quot;,
<br>
maybe unphysical too) which directly blocks the EPR argument (saying 
<br>
that subsystems are &quot;separable&quot;); and this is, i.e., what Henry Stapp 
<br>
believes;
<br>
- Much more elaborate suggestions are at quant-ph/0110107 and
<br>
quant-ph/0102053.
<br>
<p>Btw John Bell suggested - en passant - a sort of iper-determinism,
<br>
in the sense that even actions of observers and choices made
<br>
by experimenters were pre-determined. In this sense - he thought - 
<br>
any problem related to EPR was easy solvable.
