You know, all of that sounds fine in theory.  However, it has been my repeated 
<br>
experience that some persons on this list do broadly negatively characterize 
<br>
those they disagree with in the manner of a personal attack and do so 
<br>
repeatedly.   Each time it has occurred I rarely see any apparent action from 
<br>
any moderator[s] in place.  Instead I once in a great while see a message 
<br>
much like your own that in part says to let bygones be bygones without 
<br>
addressing the existing problem directly (as far as I get to see anyhow).   
<br>
This seems to me not exactly just or leading to a reasonably civilized 
<br>
e-environment.   Also, it should, in my opinion,  be the right of anyone who 
<br>
is personally attacked to at least say publicly, &quot;hey, that is a personal 
<br>
attack!&quot;   if they feel so inclined.   Otherwise the attackers get to make 
<br>
public smears that are only addressed and cleaned up, if at all, in private.

<em>&gt; I have received some private email asking questions about my plans for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moderation.  Here are a few brief comments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; First, I want to emphasize that this is a temporary role.  The time frame
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussed was about a week.  I am realistic enough to understand that it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may extend somewhat beyond that time, but I have no intention of becoming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a long-term moderator.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, I also do not intend to deal with old issues.  I will try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; address new issues going forward, but I won't deal with old baggage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That would be taking on an open-ended responsibility.  I realize that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many people feel that they have been wronged and still carry grudges
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or feelings of resentment.  I'm sorry, but all I can suggest is that we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; try to put these issues behind us and move on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Third, I only intend to enforce the list rules, which I have appended
</em><br>
<em>&gt; below.  The main issue recently is personal attacks, dealing with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the character of the poster rather than the arguments he offers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I realize that this is a gray area and that it is difficult to stay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the right side of this line.  Nevertheless I would ask that list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; members redouble their efforts to follow this rule.  Address arguments.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Avoid characterizing people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A question has arisen about how list members should respond to problems:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;If someone attacks your character, insults you, or otherwise violates the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; above rule, do NOT retaliate in like manner. Instead, send us a complaint
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to <a href="mailto:info@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">info@extropy.org</a>) and take the matter off-list.&quot;  I suggest also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copying my personal email address, <a href="mailto:hal@finney.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">hal@finney.org</a>, since I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that <a href="mailto:info@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">info@extropy.org</a> is being forwarded to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My reading of this is that you should complain if you, personally,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were attacked.  Don't complain on behalf of other people.  As far as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replying to attacking messages, the rules only say not to &quot;retaliate&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But keep in mind that if the message attacked you personally, it will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very difficult for you to respond in an objective manner.  Experience
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shows that once a thread becomes personal, it usually only gets worse.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In those cases it is best to register a complaint as described in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rules and not to respond on the list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Last, if you do get a warning from me off-list, try to look at it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructively.  My intention is to encourage vigorous and honest debate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The best way to do that with controversial topics is to keep things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective and impersonal.  If we can learn to argue in this way then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the quality of the list dialog will improve.
</em><br>
