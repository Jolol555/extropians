<p><em>&gt; &quot;Everyone is entitled to their opinion&quot; is such a cop out. Do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that monarchists should bring the monarchy back to Italy? Perhaps the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pope should rule Italy like he used to? Or the Spanish? Perhaps the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nazis should run Germany once more...
</em><br>
<p>Do you mean that only *some* people are entitled to their opinion - and
<br>
that, depending on the opinion - some other people are not?  How would you
<br>
suggest silencing the people with whom you disagree?
<br>
<p>IMO &quot;Everyone is entitled to their opinion&quot; is not a copout.  That statement
<br>
does not indicate that all opinions are *worthy* of respect, but only that
<br>
one's entitlement to make those opinions is respected.  I've observed that
<br>
many people (I'm not saying this about you, Mike, necessarily) seem to think
<br>
that &quot;respect&quot; means sanctioning any and all opinions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There are some opinions which, while people are entitled to them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot be permitted to find fertile ground to take root in reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
There already are opinions which have found fertile ground in *reality,*
<br>
even though the taproot from which they sprouted is based in *unreality.*
<br>
That is to say, crackpot ideas are already here and growing abundantly.
<br>
(I'll stop right here, as this dialogue is taking on the characteristics of
<br>
Peter Sellers' character, Chance the Gardener).
