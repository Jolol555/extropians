</em><br>
<em>&gt;go back to your blissful ignorance.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;Before reading this message of yours, I had mostly completed writing this
<br>
response to an earlier message:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;It seems to me that truth is needed to achieve cooperation in a wide
<br>
enough variety of circumstances that we would all better off if we could
<br>
make a binding agreement to be as close to truthful Bayesians as our
<br>
computational powers allow.
<br>
&nbsp;Special interest political pressures depend on voters misunderstanding
<br>
the effects of the policies they promote. Corporate salesmen cooperate
<br>
with customers if they are sufficiently commited to the truth, but harm
<br>
customers if their claims are far enough from the truth. Managers plan
<br>
better if their employees accurately forecast what they can deliver. Charities
<br>
can be of net benefit to society if their function is accurately known, and
<br>
can be wasteful otherwise.
<br>
&nbsp;Without simple rules concerning when we agree to be truthful (e.g.
<br>
always demand the truth except in cases that are clearly distinct from
<br>
normal interactions, such as bluffing in poker), there is little hope of
<br>
determining whether people are living up to that agreement.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But after noticing that you seem to disagree with this last sentence, I have
<br>
to admit that I'm not very certain about it. But I'm still guessing that I'm
<br>
right.
<br>
&nbsp;It is harder to have disgreements with stock market prices that persist
<br>
for years than it is to have persistent disgreements about how legislation
<br>
is made, because market prices allow much less room for ambiguity and less
<br>
room for selective use of evidence than descriptions of the legislative
<br>
process do.
<br>
&nbsp;Likewise, betting markets make cognitive dissonance expensive, so I expect
<br>
that to the extent they improve society it will be more by causing widespread
<br>
increases in truth-seeking than by enabling us to rely on specialized
<br>
expertise to perform that function.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;And of course, none of this says much about whether people should place
<br>
an unusually high value on truth when the relevant recipricators probably
<br>
won't be. It only says that people who don't support the creation of more
<br>
institutions such as idea futures markets that promote truth-seeking are
<br>
failing to live up to the standards of social responsibility that we ought
<br>
to be setting.
