<p>
I'm no encryption expert but since reading Simon Singh's
<br>
The Code Book back in 1999 I've had the impression that
<br>
there is a race on between the developers of quantum 
<br>
computers that could crack existing codes and the development
<br>
of quantum encryption which could produce uncrackable
<br>
codes even given quantum computers. I'm not sure what the
<br>
state of the art is - the following article seems to gives some hints.
<br>
<p>But given recent discussions about privacy/secrecy and natural 
<br>
concerns about the uses of technology by terrorists I wonder 
<br>
what other peoples views would be on the following.
<br>
<p>If it was possible to put quantum encryption affordably on a
<br>
laptop yet effectively everyone would have it would that be a
<br>
net good? 
<br>
<p>My feeling is that at this stage in evolution I probably say yes
<br>
because I see it as unhealthy for govts to have quantum 
<br>
computers and citizens not to have some privacy. I am also
<br>
aware good encryption might be a prerequisite for the modular
<br>
development of certain legitimate and extropic technologies
<br>
that individual governments might prefer not be developed
<br>
except by their own defence departments. 
<br>
<p>Privacy for all. Or privacy for governments only? Thoughts?

<br>
<p>&quot;NEW YORK - Quantum encryption pioneers promise
<br>
to put the world's first uncrackably secure networks online
<br>
by early 2003. Based on the quantum properties of photons,
<br>
quantum encryption guarantees absolutely secure optical
<br>
communications.
<br>
<p>Three independent experiments recently have demonstrated
<br>
such systems. Geneva-based id Quantique SA encoded a
<br>
secure transmission on a 70-kilometer fiber-optic link in
<br>
Europe; MajiQ Technologies Inc., here, used a 30-km link;
<br>
and researchers at Northwestern University (Evanston, Ill.)
<br>
demonstrated a 250-Mbit/second quantum encrypted 
<br>
transmission over a short link. 
<br>
<p>&quot;Our quantum random-number generator and our single-
<br>
photon detector module are available now and are in use by
<br>
several customers around the world,&quot; said Gregoire Ribordy,
<br>
a manager at id Quantique. A beta version of a third product,
<br>
a quantum-key distribution system, &quot;has been fully tested, and
<br>
we are in advanced discussions with several potential launch
<br>
customers,&quot; he added.
<br>
<p>Securing the Internet
<br>
<p>For its part, MagiQ says that its Navajo system is currently at
<br>
the alpha stage and promises real beta sites on selected 
<br>
campuses in the United States in the first quarter. Both
<br>
companies are also talking about secure through-the-air
<br>
communications with satellites.&quot;
<br>
etc
