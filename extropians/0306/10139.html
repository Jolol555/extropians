By the way, I tracked down the scientist cited on the Steele program:
<br>
Patrick Fogarty (his name wrongly given as `Fogarthy' in the TV report).
<br>
He's using transposons, and I can't see how this helps a Lamarckian.

<br>
Biotech company Tosk of San Francisco was cited as saying it can add genes
<br>
to mammalian cells with unprecedented efficiency with the help of fruit fly
<br>
DNA that can jump in and out of chromosomes.
<br>
The story says that the company's claims are being greeted with a mixture of
<br>
enthusiasm and scepticism by other biologists, who warn its results have yet
<br>
to be independently confirmed.
<br>
Tom Rosenquist of Stony Brook University in New York was quoted as saying,
<br>
&quot;But if it works the way they claim, it's revolutionary.&quot;
<br>
The story explains that introducing genes into mammals is laborious and
<br>
expensive at present, so the technique is only used for research and to
<br>
create animals that yield high-value medical products. But if making GM
<br>
mammals becomes cheap and easy, companies could soon be modifying everything
<br>
from the farm animals that produce our food to our pets. Tosk's method could
<br>
even be used to correct genetic faults in people.
<br>
In Tosk's method the extra DNA is simply injected into an animal's
<br>
bloodstream. Tosk's chief executive Patrick Fogarty was cited as saying that
<br>
within a couple of weeks, it is integrated into a high proportion of cells
<br>
in many different tissues. Since some sperm and egg cells are also altered,
<br>
normal breeding can then produce animals in which every cell carries the
<br>
extra DNA.
<br>
When mice are modified by injecting DNA into their tails, Fogarty claims, 40
<br>
per cent of their offspring on average carry the extra DNA - an amazingly
<br>
high proportion. Tosk's secret is jumping genes, or transposons, which are
<br>
found in many organisms. They are genetic parasites: bits of DNA with no
<br>
function, merely the peculiar ability to spread themselves around by hopping
<br>
in and out of DNA with the help of a &quot;cut-and-paste&quot; enzyme called a
<br>
transposase.
