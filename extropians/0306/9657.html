<em>&gt;        MEZ states that he is middle eastern unless I made a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mistake.  He is representing the middle eastern point of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; view.  It is not groundless and personal to assume he has 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same motives as an American in the same position.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [ snip ... ]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is going on in the middle east and consequently what 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; danger MEZ family &amp; friends are in.  Should the US succeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in assisting Iraq lift itself up then MEZ' family &amp; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; friends are likely to be unable to hold their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; own population down any further.  People hanging by the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; neck from lamp poles comes to mind.
</em><br>
<p>It pains me to have to respond to one of Ron's posts, but I feel the
<br>
need to set the record straight, at least for the benefit of the other
<br>
people reading this thread.
<br>
<p>1) I'm an american.  I've lived here since the age of 3.  My
<br>
allegiance is first to all sentient life, second to humanity, and
<br>
third to the US.  
<br>
<p>When I look at the place I was born (egypt) it's primarily with a
<br>
sense of sadness.  As John Clark writes, the arabs have themselves to
<br>
blame more than anyone else for their current situation.
<br>
<p>2) I'm not representing a middle eastern point of view.  I'm providing
<br>
the viewpoint of an american who has first hand experience with the
<br>
middle east.
<br>
<p>3) My relatives in egypt are members of an oppressed and discriminated
<br>
against minority (egyptian christians).  They are the oppressed rather
<br>
than the oppressors.  From an early age I was taught that Islam is an
<br>
evil religion.  In many ways I hold my current opinions /despite/ my
<br>
upbringing, rather than because of it.
<br>
<p>4) To the extent that I care about the welfare of my relatives in
<br>
Egypt, I would like to see Egypt become more like the US.  I'd like to
<br>
see it become a democracy rather than a dictatorship.  I'd like to see
<br>
it become a modern capitalist society rather than a mostly statist
<br>
one.  
<br>
<p>Indeed, my whole point in this thread has been that the US system
<br>
(democracy and capitalism) IS SUPERIOR to the predominant arab system
<br>
(corrupt totalitarian government and state economy) and that the
<br>
western memes will win out and transform the region if the US takes
<br>
action to encourage them.  
<br>
<p>Somehow Ron has misconstrued my comments into some attack on the US or
<br>
defense of the middle eastern status quo, which he has grotesquely
<br>
attributed to my having something to gain from the oppression of the
<br>
middle eastern masses.  I hope this post has set the record straight.
