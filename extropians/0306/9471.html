<em>&gt; &gt; (Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Simulation%20Argument%20again">mlorrey@yahoo.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; However, I'd like to point out some misperceived conclusions. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; example, I'd agree that the odds that we live in a simulation are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; undetermined. I went on to point out that given such a situation,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the only proper stance for a scientific individual at this point 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in time is to be agnostic, NOT atheistic. Atheism is as much a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leap of faith in such a state of undetermined reality as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religiosity. It is NO LESS a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; leap of faith as well. If the argument that we live in a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; holds true, then atheism is a completely improper stance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; religiosity should be the norm, since the existence of a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; implies some meta-entity creating and/or operating the simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Now, I can entirely forsee that based on this logic, individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; determined to hold fast to their atheistic faith will try to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; undermine the simulation argument, while the religious will try 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to support it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; IMHO this should and can be a real debate that the religious can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; take part in equally, and should cast aside lots of the silly 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aspects of mainstream creationism that depend on obsolete science.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This contention has two problems, as it clearly must by the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that I have a great admiration for the simulation argument and yet
</em><br>
<em>&gt; remain an atheist.  First of all, to equate religious notions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; God with notions of wholly non-supernatural beings that might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; running a simulation is to totally ignore centuries of theology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We're bombarded again and again with hundreds of ideas about God;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the fact that /one/ of those ideas (i.e. &quot;creator&quot;) might be true
</em><br>
<em>&gt; says nothing about the rest. That's the &quot;package deal&quot; fallacy.
</em><br>
<p>I make no assumptions about package deals. I do make a proposition
<br>
that, given Clarke's Law, and given the much greater degree of
<br>
technological advancement necessary to effect a simulation such as our
<br>
present reality over our own capabilities at present, that we are
<br>
presently unqualified to judge what such entities can and cannot do
<br>
within their simulation.
<br>
<p>Saying a system operator is not a 'god' is a cop out for an individual
<br>
afraid to accept the implications of a proposition. What is one of the
<br>
most common sysop passwords? God. Having such a degree of control over
<br>
a simulated world, and advancement ahead of it, confers godhood.
<br>
<p>So you don't like the implications of the term due to cultural baggage.
<br>
So what. Get over it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Second, the old &quot;atheism is a faith too&quot; canard has been debunked
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so many times by those more capable than I that I hardly feel up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the task, but I'll try, just for the record: As a rational being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I cannot totally reject any possibility for all time under all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possible circumstances. All knowledge is tentative, and must change
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with new evidence. But that doesn't mean I can't base decisions on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I consider to be my current working model of the universe, based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the best knowledge I have so far. This working hypothesis is my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;world view&quot;, if you will. It differs from &quot;faith&quot; in that I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explicity understand it to be tentative even though I may bet my life
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on it every day. I have no choice, after all: it is necessary to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have /some/ world view to base one's actions upon or else one is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impotent. 
</em><br>
<p>I'd have to contest this assumption. I would say it is entirely
<br>
unnecessary to have a world view vis a vis religion vs. atheism yet to
<br>
be able to remain quite potent in ones freedom of action and thought.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So my current world view includes things like the laws of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, math, evolution, and the absence of anything resembling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical theistic descriptions of God. But I am not &quot;agnostic&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about God any more than I am &quot;agnostic&quot; about physics, just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't offer complete, final, unassailable proof of either one.
</em><br>
<p>This is a false exclusion. If the simulation argument holds, then it is
<br>
entirely possible to accept the laws of physics, math, evolution yet to
<br>
also accept the possibility *as an undetermined probability at
<br>
present*, and as a reality of one can demonstrate being within a
<br>
simulation.
<br>
<p>The presence of paranormal phenomena could, in fact, be considered
<br>
evidence that one is in a simulation, if such phenomena are observable
<br>
and outside the bounds of the laws of physics. Not saying they exist in
<br>
this universe, but pointing to what they might be useful for.
<br>
<p>For example, if ever psi phenomena can be demonstrated, then this might
<br>
be evidence of 'hacking the sim'. This is the whole point of the
<br>
dialogue in the Oracle's apartment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Simple honesty demands that I describe what I believe in simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; terms: I believe that atoms exist, and that God doesn't. Just because
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can't prove the non-existence of God any more than I can prove
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the non-existence of Santa Claus, that doesn't mean I have to hold
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some wishy-washy ineffective stance that Santa Claus /might/ exist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as part of my present world view. That's just a waste of effort.
</em><br>
<p>Ah, but can you point to an atom? Are they directly observable? No, you
<br>
must infer they exist based on indirect observation, using tools to
<br>
mediate the experience (and if this were a sim, such tools should
<br>
function the same way, whether or not atoms really exist or are just
<br>
individually simulated whenever you use an electron microscope.)
<br>
<p>The Slashdot discussion pointed this out, that a sim doesn't need even
<br>
to simulate every atom all the time, since macroscale phenomena are all
<br>
we are able to observe directly. Atomic scale and subatomic phenomena
<br>
are only observed via mediation technologies.
<br>
<p>How, then, in a sim, is a bible any different from a supercollider? The
<br>
supercollider may behave more reliably, is all.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather simply conclude for now that there's no Santa Claus, and live
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my life under that assumption until something forces me to reexamine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it. Calling that &quot;agnosticism&quot; is a cop-out. If you asked me whether,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really, deep down, as part of my present being, whether I thought
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there was a Santa Claus, I wouldn't answer &quot;maybe&quot;, I'd answer &quot;no&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's what I think, right now. Same for God. Today, I am an atheist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That's not taking a leap of faith or making a dogmatic commitment;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it's simple honesty.
</em><br>
<p>Only if you refuse to accept the simulation argument taxonomy of
<br>
possible universes and instead adhere to strict materialism. It is self
<br>
dishonesty, at least for anyone claiming to be a scientist.
<br>
<p>There is a difference between thinking there is more likely than not no
<br>
God, and claiming to know that there is no God. One is agnosticism and
<br>
the other is atheism.
<br>
<p>Claiming knowledge in the absence of evidence is the very definition of faith.
