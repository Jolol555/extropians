<em>&gt; Aside from speaking into a voice recorder, does anyone else have any 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; that event to be simulated in greater detail?  In particular, such that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the simulator to get a historically accurate probability distribution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the gross characteristics of the permanent record created (its ones 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and zeroes, which would be later examined), the simulator would find it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; useful to simulate the original event in greater-than-usual detail.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Note that we are talking about making it *useful* for the simulator to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expend more computing power, to simulate to a greater depth, in order to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get a *more accurate* picture of the *probability distribution* of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ones and zeroes in the permanent record.  This means that the probability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution of the permanent record depends on fine physical details in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a way which can be usefully refined by expending more computing power. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assume that the initial conditions are 'spread out' evenly over whatever 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; space of possibilities is permitted by the state of the existing low- 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resolution simulation at the moment when it begins modeling at greater 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detail, so that what we want is not just sensitive dependency on initial 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conditions, but the simulator's ability to get a more historically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; realistic picture of the probability distribution, after dropping from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the previous low resolution into the evenly distributed high-resolution 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; initial conditions, by expending more computing power to model the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; convergence of the development of those initial conditions at a finer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level of detail.  So what we want is a physical process, which converges 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to some degree, which creates sensitive dependency in the permanent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; record, such that a noticeably more refined picture of the probability 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distribution of the permanent record can be obtained by expending more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing power to simulate that moment at a finer level of resolution.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or if that's too complicated: some way of creating a permanent record 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that sensitively depends on small details of the sim - either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expensively, using off-the-shelf equipment, or (bonus points) using stuff 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lying around the house.
</em><br>
<p>But there's recording, and then there's processing. What if _attention_ 
<br>
(mine, yours, *&quot;theirs&quot;*) is the limiting factor? If nobody _looks_ at the 
<br>
permanent record, is it there? Not trying to gainsay your line of 
<br>
reasoning, just trying to get my head around what seems like a fatal flaw. 
<br>
It's be diferent, perhaps, if the &quot;sensitive dependency&quot; influenced, say, 
<br>
the shape of a river, or a famous statue, or something. But in order to 
<br>
tell, wouldn't *everybody* (or a preponderance of people) have to know 
<br>
about the connection ahead of time?
<br>
<p>I mean, how much time would you personally spend looking at the ones and 
<br>
zeroes of that audio recording, out of all the time in your life? After 
<br>
you'd done so, wouldn't you just compress the experience into a memory with 
<br>
a lot fewer bits?
<br>
<p>Sorry if this is scattered, I hope you can encode the experience 
<br>
meaningfully. :)
