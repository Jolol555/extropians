<p><em>&gt; I have to agree with Eliezer S. Yudkowsky regarding the huge dangers of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; patriotism.   Evolution has clearly programmed us to have strong inclinations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward group loyalty, and to bias our beliefs on this basis.  It was in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our ancestor's individual interest to be so biased, and may well be in our
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual interest today to be so biased.  But such tendencies cause great
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problems for someone who tries hard to eliminate biases in his or her beliefs.
</em><br>
<p>I don't disagree with anything here.  However, this is not
<br>
necessarily *directly* about beliefs.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course that raises the question of why believing in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth should have such an overwhelming importance, moral or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise.  Some plausibly argue that it is more moral to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be loyal to one's group, even if this means that your beliefs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will be biased, just as they believe it is more moral to give
</em><br>
<em>&gt; charity to members of your group, even if this means that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; worse off outsiders go without.
</em><br>
<p>One, today, is deluding himself if he believes that he is without bias,
<br>
as you know.  Indeed we must view patriotism, or love, as dangerous
<br>
in this regard.  However, the phenomenon transcends this in two
<br>
ways.  The first is that the integrity of the self may indeed
<br>
require a bias; others might say the same about a group.  (We
<br>
have, for example, seen calls for a uniformity of beliefs that
<br>
we as extropians present to the world, or even entertain.)
<br>
<p>For another, values constitute a large part of patriotism or
<br>
love.  One treasures that which is loved, or treasures the group
<br>
to which one has loyalty.  This means willingly sacrificing the
<br>
benefit of those who are not of one's group, or not loved.  Do
<br>
you agree that two ideal perfect Bayesians might nonetheless
<br>
firmly disagree about to whom a piece of real estate belongs?
<br>
Or do ideal Bayesians have no values?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have to admit to while I think that there are few things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more important than believing the truth, I can offer only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disappointingly weak moral arguments to justify this.
</em><br>
<p>Quite a few of us fallible human beings strive, I think, for
<br>
the truth while admitting our ideological and philosophical
<br>
biases.  Of course, results will vary:  how much do you
<br>
dislike or hate oppression? how much do you love your people?
<br>
how much sympathy do you really have for animals? and so on.
<br>
<p>Indeed, we can be more suspicious of the statements of those
<br>
we think visibly biased, and that's as it should be.  But in
<br>
theory, having enormous loves or hates, need not deflect an
<br>
ideal rationalist from the truth.  It's just that many things,
<br>
even ownership, cannot always be objectively determined.
<br>
