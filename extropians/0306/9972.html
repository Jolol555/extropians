<p>They're banning it because Egyptians don't like the Israeli's
<br>
Given that they fought 3 wars with them, and the references to
<br>
Zion.  Normally they cut movies heavily anyway.  I watched 
<br>
Terminator 2, and its running time was something like 58 minutes.
<br>
it was almost incomprehensible.  Furthermore, almost everybody in
<br>
Egypt has satellite service (read: not-edited by Egyptian authorities)
<br>
Because Egyptian TV is state-run, and sucks heavily.  Pretty much
<br>
The only thing that's even remotely decent on the &quot;public&quot; airwaves
<br>
is the Egyptian equivalent of novellas, and Egyptian movies filmed in
<br>
1940's (the equivalent of the golden age in film-making, although 
<br>
contemporary films are ok).
<br>
<p>Besides which, Egypts got far more serious problems than access 
<br>
to the Matrix.  Fully 50% of the population is illiterate, 94% of its
<br>
Land is non-arable, hepatitis-C is running rampant, the mosquito-killing
<br>
Programs [sponsered by the government] have lost funding, all the 
<br>
high-quality libraries are private, its got 20% unemployment [with
<br>
Mandatory conscription for all males for avg 1.5 years or so!] despite
<br>
loans to the government ranging from 1-2 BILLION dollars a year, the
<br>
quality of education there bites, their courts (which are running off
<br>
A mixture of french &amp; islamic law) are overwhelmed [it takes something
<br>
Like 9 years for the case to get reviewed by the first of 3 judges!], 
<br>
police and military corruption is totally out of control, and of course,
<br>
its been under martial law [emergency law provisions] since 1981 when
<br>
Mubarek seized control.   Not to mention their sterling (sarcastic
<br>
obviously)
<br>
Infrastructure and their complete lack of any sort of portable credit
<br>
for
<br>
a citizen.
<br>
<p>On the plus side, nobody starves in Egypt, they have great cellphone
<br>
Service [although it's a bit pricey unless you can get a business
<br>
Line], and you can catch a taxi from almost anywhere in Cairo.
<br>
<p>Overall though, I'ld say the censoring/banning of the matrix is the 
<br>
Least of Egypts worries.  Being a fan of PT Barnum, any press is
<br>
Good press though :)
<br>
<p>Omard-out
