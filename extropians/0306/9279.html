<p>I'll do my best not to make claims that i can't support. Rather than
<br>
specializing in a science of my liking i decided that i wanted to put my
<br>
time and attention toward promoting intelligence to a larger audience. I
<br>
consider myself an adept in human behavior and communication. Other than
<br>
that i do PR for intelligence and the brain. I try to make it a little more
<br>
friendly and accessible for the rest of the world. For my part i am on the
<br>
list more to learn than to debate. I like to surround myself with good
<br>
information and logic.
<br>
<p>My hopes are also that through this list i will find people who are working
<br>
on things that i want to promote through my media endeavors. My main
<br>
concerns are with growing the popularity of intelligent endeavors thereby
<br>
making them more viable as media and financial ventures. I'm also hoping to
<br>
find people that are willing to share their ideas in a bigger forum than
<br>
just this list and that are interested in promoting Extropian-types of ideas
<br>
to a larger audience through their writing or other mediums.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
