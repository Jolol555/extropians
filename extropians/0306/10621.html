Hold on. My impression of the Turing test was that the human and the AI
<br>
would not be seperated and that the human would have no way of knowing that
<br>
it was a computer at the other end. I always assumed this would be done in
<br>
an &quot;instant messaging&quot; sort of way. In this case, the additional computing
<br>
power of mimicking emotional responses (I am assuming you were referring to
<br>
voice inflection, etc) would not be necessary. I don't think that a voice or
<br>
emotional capabilities would be important in this case.
<br>
<p>Also, with each individual having different emotional responses to different
<br>
stimuli, to get an accurate result, would you have to have the human
<br>
converse with a variety of people? Say 10, with only 1 being a computer?
<br>
Can't the Turing test be manipulated by how &quot;emotional&quot; each human would
<br>
act? Couldn't you easily program in randon &quot;HOLY COW!&quot;s and &quot;Gosh darn
<br>
it!&quot;s? and as long as the cognitive abilities were up there, the emotional
<br>
responses would seem odd (there's many odd people out there) but not
<br>
&quot;inhuman&quot;
<br>
<p>Furthermore, I have other problems with the subjective nature of the Turing
<br>
test itself. Problems come up such as the following:
<br>
1.) Given several groups of 100 people from various backgrounds, age groups
<br>
and educational levels, you will still have a wide range of people who
<br>
either think it is a machine or a human they are conversing with. The
<br>
person's own emotional and opinion plays a part.
<br>
2.) Even if it were a human on the other side of the conversation, some
<br>
people are bound to think it is a machine.
<br>
3.) Different people would expect different responses to the same questions
<br>
when they are deciding whether or not it is an AI or human,
<br>
and finally,
<br>
4.) An AI that was nowhere near as capable as a human intellectually still
<br>
may pass simply because even an educated human may just think they are
<br>
dealing with an ignorant human on the other side.
<br>
<p>Am I way off here in thinking that we may never be able to divise a
<br>
sufficient test simply because as human beings, we have a wide range of
<br>
intellectual capabilities that is too broad to nail down? Can we even use
<br>
this test to ensure that a human is human?

machine
<br>
<em>&gt; by the year 20xx, specifically, the machine would have to pass repeatedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (30 times, 100 times?) the classic Turing test, with a human examiner, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one more human participant, conversing on an unrestricted range of
</em><br>
subjects
<br>
<em>&gt; without allowing the examiner to differentiate between the machine and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; human participant. This would be actually a rather stringent test, since
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; AGI would need to precisely emulate not only the cognitive capacities of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; human, but also have convincing emotional responses.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There was a claim for binary Turing test on ideosphere but it was retired.
