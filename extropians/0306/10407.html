<p><em>&gt; I tried in the beginning to correct what
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to not respond to what little that I read that misrepresents me.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I would rather support my reputation in activities off of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropians email list.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; I do protest that absent periods and not reading/responding to 85%
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the messages here, implies consent or agreement of some topic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Often I hear of what people have responded to my short links or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words via other people, and while it is annoying for me to sometimes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find my words or intention twisted (sometimes to the extreme), it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not a conversation-clarification or battle that is worth my efforts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to fight.
</em><br>
<p>This is my biggest concern, and why I seem have a personal vendetta to fight
<br>
here.  I am often contacted off-list by people who have given up trying to
<br>
have discussions on the extropians list.  Sometimes they just become lurkers
<br>
only, sometimes they drop off altogether.  They just get tired of the
<br>
constant battles to defend themselves online.  This list is simply more
<br>
hurtful and difficult and dangerous than other lists.  And this is driving
<br>
away potential participants in droves.  It is definitely hurting our goals
<br>
for spreading memes about the extropian philosophy.  Instead, we are
<br>
associating political infighting and extreme political viewpoints with our
<br>
movement.
<br>
<p>There is also the concern over personal reputations and having
<br>
misrepresentations tar us in public.  Many of us have professional careers
<br>
that require us to avoid the appearance of impropriety.  I personally have
<br>
had clients reject contracts with me because an Internet search on my name
<br>
shows me connected to the Extropians List.  Most people don't realize that
<br>
this is why I drop in and out over the years, and why I suddenly disappeared
<br>
from the Board of Directors.  When the list just becomes too extreme, I feel
<br>
that it is detrimental for me to be associated with it.  I have never had
<br>
any problem with ExI or the philosophy.  But the false accusations on this
<br>
list and the level of debate here literally reflects poorly on my and
<br>
damages my profession.  A simple Google on any of our names will bring up
<br>
the list archives due to our numerous postings.  This instantly links each
<br>
of us to list discussions whether we are personally involved or not.
<br>
<p>I will even reveal something that few people know.  A couple of years ago
<br>
when I was involved in a dot-com startup that no longer exists, one of our
<br>
venture capitalists expressed interest in providing funding to ExI.  They
<br>
thought our futuristic and technological philosophies might give an
<br>
executive better insight and a better reputation.  They were intrigued by my
<br>
involvement with the Board of Directors and thought this would make my
<br>
executive profile look attractive to investors in future startups.  To
<br>
facilitate this angle, they thought they could have their execs as members
<br>
for free think-tank support and prestige, as well as indicating their active
<br>
involvement in promoting future technology.  In return, they would want to
<br>
provide funding to keep ExI viable and promotional activities to enhance
<br>
ExI's visibility in the technology sector.  The idea was still at the
<br>
talking stage, and I had barely mentioned the possibility to Max and
<br>
Natasha, when suddenly they pulled out and dropped any consideration of me
<br>
or ExI for any future projects.  They had found the list and were reading
<br>
it.  They said their execs were horrified at what they saw.  They were
<br>
unanimous that they did not want to be even indirectly associated with such
<br>
unprofessional behavior.  This was a huge loss of a potential support and
<br>
funding for ExI.  And it was lost due to bad behavior on this list which had
<br>
nothing to do with ExI, the Board of Directors, or anything officially
<br>
connected to the extropian philosophy.
<br>
<p>This has forever shortened my patience with unprofessional behavior,
<br>
personal attacks, and unfounded accusations in this public forum.  We are
<br>
supposed to be an educational or promotional group, and yet we are driving
<br>
away interest customers in droves.
