<p><em>&gt; I'm not blasé, I know it's a terrible problem but I

also know that making nice to Islam will not reduce

the west.  They are angry at us for what we are not
<br>
what we did. 
<br>
<p>Allow me to present an alternate view. (Which is a
<br>
gentle BUT RESPECTFUL way to say I disagree.)
<br>
<p>When the 911 attacks came, I thought &quot;***NOW SURELY***
<br>
people will ask 'Why?' &quot;  Then, before the question
<br>
could be posed large in the forum of public discourse,
<br>
Bush made his &quot;You're either with us or your against
<br>
us&quot; speech of Sept 20, 2001, and disposed of the
<br>
question (begged the question? deflected the
<br>
question?, distracted us from the question? pre-empted
<br>
the question?) He said the terrorists did this because
<br>
they hate us because we're rich and free, and all they
<br>
know is the will to power. (Strikingly, this seems an
<br>
apt characterization of the attitude of the Patrician
<br>
ruling class (of which the Bush cabal is a subset)
<br>
towards the &quot;loyal&quot; opposition.)  
<br>
<p>I realized then that we were screwed.  That the
<br>
question would not be addressed honestly--if
<br>
ever--until the next, presumably larger, lethal event.
<br>
&nbsp;How bad does it have to hurt before someone gets real
<br>
about this? (Sidenote:  Violence gets attention when
<br>
seemingly nothing else will, but inflames reason and
<br>
extirpates sympathy. It's counterproductive, and
<br>
frankly, dumb.  A credible threat of violence is more
<br>
practical, but still comes from the same bitter menu
<br>
of options.  There is a better way.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ...the root cause of that anger was not any specific
</em><br>
action committed by the west.  They are angry at us
<br>
for what we are not what we did.
<br>
<p>No.  Some segment of Islam--maybe even a very large
<br>
fraction--may disapprove of western cultural values,
<br>
but so long as we keep it here, and don't force it on
<br>
them, it's probably not something they care a whole
<br>
lot about.
<br>
<p>It's the aggressive intrusion of the west that
<br>
inspires their antipathy.  The crusades.  The
<br>
invasions of western &quot;colonial&quot; powers, most noitable
<br>
and recently the parcelling up of the mideast by the
<br>
Europeans (primarily the Brits) after the defeat of
<br>
the Ottomans.  The propping up of corrupt local puppet
<br>
regimes for the dual benefit of control of a strategic
<br>
resource (oil) and the theft(essentially) of the
<br>
profits therefrom.  And finally, the jewel in the
<br>
crown, the poison pill, the knife in the back (or
<br>
perhaps I should say the ice pick in the face) of the
<br>
deliberate, overt, unashamed, and unrelenting
<br>
&quot;erasure&quot; of Palestine and ethnic cleansing of the
<br>
Palestinians, accompanied by their replacement by an
<br>
ultra-aggressive, ultra-militaristic(which is to say
<br>
threatening), and ultra-contemptuous 
<br>
Jewish state (where, despite declamations of its
<br>
democratic nature, Jews are, by law, the privileged
<br>
class).
<br>
<p>That is why they are pissed.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;The nationalist not only does not disapprove of
<br>
atrocities committed by his own side, but he has a
<br>
remarkable capacity for not even hearing about them.&quot;
