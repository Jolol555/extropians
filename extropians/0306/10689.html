<p>It is especially surprising since Lander is the motivating force behind
<br>
the design of the MIT/Whitehead Genome Sequencing Center where in ~5-7 years
<br>
they redesigned how genome sequencing should be done (lots of special purpose
<br>
equipment) and came out way ahead of almost everyone else in terms of
<br>
throughput.  And Lander is a fairly young guy.
<br>
<p>I would suspect that he is trying not to over-hype (see my next related
<br>
message).  Most (though not all) of the people in the genome community
<br>
are not aware of the effects of converging technologies (even though
<br>
current sequencing machines are based on the convergence of lasers;
<br>
micro-capillaries; advances in polymer matrices &amp; fluorescent molecules;
<br>
CCDs and software.
<br>
<p>It may be that Lander feels that this generation gathers the information
<br>
but it will take the next generation to produce therapeutics from it.
<br>
<p>The problem is with something like 8000+ genetic diseases it is going
<br>
to take some time to identify them all.  In particular, with rare
<br>
diseases it is going to take some time to identify enough individuals
<br>
to get the statistical significance one needs to do genotyping to
<br>
identify the &quot;defective&quot; gene(s).  In other cases, with common diseases,
<br>
there may be a large number of genes involved, so in those cases one
<br>
needs very large sample populations and gaining access to those is
<br>
very very difficult.  (Decode's work in Iceland or work in Estonia
<br>
to produce national databases come to mind.)
<br>
<p>So it may be that we get &quot;half&quot; of the pie very easily (e.g. a single gene
<br>
disease in several families following a known inheritance pattern) and in
<br>
the case of the other &quot;half&quot; its a real nightmare (due to too few samples
<br>
or too many genes).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Its also clear that philanthropic funding is still available for good
</em><br>
<em>&gt; causes.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, read the Wired article about Rutan and the X-prize...
