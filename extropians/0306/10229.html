<p>The problem is combinatorics. The number of chemicals that you can make
<br>
increase very fast with the number of atoms. For ten carbon atoms there
<br>
are 75 different alkanes, for 20 366,319, for 30 4,111,846,763 and for
<br>
40 62,491,178,805,831 (from <a href="http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/quiz.htm">http://www.rod.beavon.clara.net/quiz.htm</a>). 
<br>
And that was just combining carbon and hydrogen. The real problem is
<br>
that each bond in these molecules can also turn in different directions
<br>
so you end up with a number of configurations growing roughly
<br>
exponentially with size for *each* possible molecule. So finding which 
<br>
chemical in which low-energy configuration would fit a receptor or have 
<br>
a neat property would require searching through a space that increases 
<br>
superexponentially with the number of atoms involved. This is 
<br>
impractical given most advances in computing, and even quantum computers 
<br>
would only make the problem very expensive. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I began thinking about this when I was watching a program that
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes, isn't it annoying? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I know that we currently don;t have the processing power to do this,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but does anyone on this board know roughly how much processing power
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we would need? 
</em><br>
<p>Let's say that the number of chemicals containing N atoms selected from
<br>
a repertoire of 92 are roughly (92^N)*(N!) (select the atoms, order them
<br>
in some order; this is an overestimate). The atoms have on the order of
<br>
N bonds which can have ~7 degrees of freedom (length, direction,
<br>
torsion), so for each molecule we have to search through a 7N
<br>
dimensional space to look for minimum energy/fitness maximum
<br>
configurations. So the total amount of work of finding the best by brute 
<br>
force is on the order of (K^N)(N!) for a large K - very slow. Even an 
<br>
exponential speedup only turns it into a N^2 log N search with a bad 
<br>
constant.
