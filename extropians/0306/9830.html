&lt;&lt;### This is incorrect - almost all Americans benefit from the
<br>
globalization
<br>
of the labor market by being able to buy services and products at a lower
<br>
price. Additionally, the foreign employees of American companies benefit
<br>
from American capital and knowledge, which enables them to purchase globally
<br>
produced goods.
<br>
<p>Freedom is good for you.
<br>
<p>Rafal&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>If one has a high-paying job one can, indeed benefit from globalization. On
<br>
the other hand, if hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs go overseas,
<br>
and those being paid are paid at a tenth the wage-level that the American IT
<br>
workers were paid at; there is no way that they, as the &quot;new&quot; workers can
<br>
ever afford goods and services offered by American companies.
<br>
<p>### The &quot;new&quot; foreign workers buy American grain, movies, machines, American
<br>
debt, weapons. A huge part of American export is dependent on the demand
<br>
created by increased affluence abroad, due in part to globalization.
<br>
Conversely, even poor (especially poor) Americans benefit from cheap but
<br>
high quality imported goods. You don't need to have a high-paying job to
<br>
shop at K-mart, and without K-mart you would be so much poorer, even with
<br>
the same relative amount of cash on hand.
<br>
<p>-------------------
<br>
<p>In essence, the &quot;new country&quot; employees are not part of the American
<br>
economic cycle.
<br>
<p>### Yes, they are.
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Its not, as if, the Parent company which off-shores these jobs, invests in
<br>
many new jobs in the US. Why should they, if goods and services are so
<br>
inexpensive overseas? This also leads to the de-stablization of American
<br>
society because skilled jobs are no longer to be had, because of the
<br>
corporation's cost savings. This can't be a good thing and is already and
<br>
election issue and a &quot;class warfare&quot; issue as well.
<br>
<p>### You can look at from a short-term point of view, or a long-term point of
<br>
view. In the former case, you try to maximize return over 1, 5 or 15 years.
<br>
Then it pays to keep knowledge controlled and tied to a place, to buy cheap
<br>
raw materials abroad, and sell your knowledge-enhanced products at a
<br>
premium, to buy more cheap raw materials. It pays to exclude competitors
<br>
rather than to improve your own abilities, so you can keep consuming more.
<br>
In the short term.
<br>
<p>In the long term however, 50 or 500 years, you want to maximize growth, even
<br>
at the cost of reducing immediate consumption (obvious to anyone who chooses
<br>
between paying off a mortgage and buying a new car when the old one still
<br>
runs). Since globalization of the economy increases the effective amount of
<br>
resources available for enlarging our knowledge, allows uniform increase in
<br>
production capacity, and a uniform increase in demand across the whole
<br>
world, including long-term demand for American goods, globalization is the
<br>
long-term favorite over narrow, parochial approaches, like mercantilism, and
<br>
protectionism. This is why globalization is good for the American consumer,
<br>
as well as the European, African or Asian consumer.
