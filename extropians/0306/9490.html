<p>Agreed Damien, but I can remember the days in the mid-90's when there
<br>
were very strong arguments for there being 100,000+ genes.  So now
<br>
we are down by 50% perhaps as much as 25%.  From a programmer standpoint
<br>
lines of code count!  One can make the case in terms of lots of
<br>
lines of code suggesting one is very productive or one can make
<br>
the case in terms of very few lines of code, perhaps suggesting
<br>
that one is very clever at getting a lot done with a minimal
<br>
amount of effort.
<br>
<p>It would appear that nature is leaning towards the second
<br>
alternative at least with respect to the human genome.
<br>
Whether other genomes have the same capabilities remain
<br>
to be seen.  Why/how the Fugu genome manages to produce
<br>
a vertebrate with ~10x less genomic code will indeed be
<br>
a very interesting puzzle to answer.
<br>
<p>For comparison purposes -- they just finished the genome
<br>
of bread mold -- nearly 10,000 genes.  Wow! I would have
<br>
hoped that I was at least three times as complex as bread
<br>
mold, instead, according to the article cited I'm closer
<br>
to two times as complex.
<br>
<p>(Now of course it looks like complexity is derived in a
<br>
very different way in higher organisms so gene count
<br>
number may be a very poor way of measuring complexity.
<br>
But I simply thought the article was interesting
<br>
and the list might find it so.)
