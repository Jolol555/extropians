<em>&gt; In regards to the other odious regimes, they merely serve
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to illustrate the fact that Damien somehow approves of a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; world and moral view in which a despot may deliberately
</em><br>
<em>&gt; murder or destroy hundreds of thousands to millions of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people, but the West may not inadvertently kill hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to remove said despot.
</em><br>
<p>This is still misleading.  The fact that Damien has not commented on these
<br>
other regimes does not imply that he supports them.  This is unreasonable
<br>
binary thinking.  You can't accuse everybody of every sin that they haven't
<br>
publically denied.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Please illuminate for those of us not occupying your higher
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; plain of logic and reasoning specifically why it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inappropriate, or an &quot;oversimplification&quot; to list the Saddam
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Hussein regime amongst a &quot;them&quot; list of similar murderous and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; barbaric tyrants ranging from Hitler to Mengistu Haile Mariam.
</em><br>
<p>As I have explained before, you are over-simplifying.  You are classifying
<br>
dissimilar enemies into a single group called &quot;them.&quot;  Combining communists,
<br>
socialist, Nazis, terrorists and radical Muslims into a single group makes
<br>
it very difficult to discuss motives, methods, goals, and possible future
<br>
actions of this &quot;group.&quot;  It would be much more accurate to describe each
<br>
group separately and only attribute motives to the groups to which they
<br>
belong.  This is a classical logical fallacy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Since it is apparent you are more than willing to share your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever cogent and not the slightest bit pretentious insights with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us, Mr. Newstrom, humbly request that you tell me how my &quot;position&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as an anti-communist (indeed, everyone's favorite at that) is so flawed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;This is the oversimplification I am talking about.  Where in the world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did you get the idea that I thought your anti-communist position was
</em><br>
flawed?&quot;
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hmm, let us return to your original post to me:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;I also noted that the previous note somehow was connected with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anti-communism AND (emphasis added) several other binary us vs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them worldviews.&quot;  You directly state that anti-communism is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subset of binary &quot;us vs them&quot; worldviews.
</em><br>
<p>No.  I am saying that your lumping all these things together is
<br>
oversimplified, binary and illogical.  I am not saying that anti-communism
<br>
itself is oversimplified, binary, or illogical.  I am not saying that any of
<br>
these individual beliefs is oversimplified, binary or illogical.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given these concise observations, one must draw the conclusion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you consider binary worldviews flawed, or incorrect.  Since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you directly assert that anti-communism is a binary worldview,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the negative implications of your comments are obvious.
</em><br>
<p>No.  Your logic is flawed.  You must not draw that conclusion.  It is false.
