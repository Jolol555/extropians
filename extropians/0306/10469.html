<em>&gt; &gt; Quite right.  That is what is going on.  But in addition

<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;       * joining the good fight against bad memes

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;       * standing up for the underdog
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and more, I suspect.  The first on my list of three here is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; what inspires crusaders to fight for the oppressed, and gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; them energy that the Bayesians lack.  I have respect for the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crusaders (occasionally I am one), both the ones for and against
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the ideas I support.  They have played and will play a crucial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; role in history and in society.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *I'm* not a crusader?  Think about this one carefully.
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  You are indeed a crusader for certain things.
<br>
And about those things you will hardly be unbiased.
<br>
I don't know if that makes you less of a &quot;Bayesian&quot;
<br>
on those subjects in certain discussions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, do you think that patriotic cheerleading actually helps anyone, or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for that matter, accomplishes anything significant at all?
</em><br>
<p>Yes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I do not count cheerleading as &quot;fighting for the oppressed&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>But it often has been.  Whether it would be physically cheering
<br>
the speakers in 1920 at a woman's rights meeting, or writing a
<br>
&quot;me too&quot; letter in the newspaper about Chinese government abuses
<br>
does (perhaps unfortunately) have an effect.
<br>
<p>But I would have to know more what you mean by &quot;cheerleading&quot;.
<br>
Mere cheering is while (sadly) effective, it could be that
<br>
cheer-leading mobilizes support.  Are you being as careful as
<br>
you'd like to be as you re-label and thus re-characterize
<br>
some activity that we had been calling by other terms?  (Namely
<br>
patriotism?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It would appear some people think they can make their basketball team win 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by rooting at the television set.  Enthusiasm is not effectiveness. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harvey Newstrom has described the only actual effect of all their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; shouting: sharply negative on the real-world events that matter.
</em><br>
<p>I would be the first to find fault with demonstrations and
<br>
&quot;me too&quot;, or &quot;yay!&quot; type support.  That's why I am interested
<br>
in carefully reasoned discourse.  But when you use such broad
<br>
terms I'm not sure I know what exactly you are talking about,
<br>
or whether, for sure, you are describing activity on this list.
