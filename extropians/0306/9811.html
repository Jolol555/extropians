Dear Transhumans/Extropes,
<br>
<p><p>Some thoughts to share.
<br>
<p>On Friday May 30, ended the Astrophysics of Dust conference in Estes
<br>
Park, Colorado (<a href="http://www.physics.utoledo.edu/~aod03/">http://www.physics.utoledo.edu/~aod03/</a>). Only a small
<br>
number of the 275 attendees were planetary scientists, the rest were
<br>
astrophysicists studying dust in the interstellar medium, in the
<br>
intergalactic medium, in circumstellar disks, and high energy objects
<br>
(e.g. quasars, starburst galaxies), and, some fraction (say 1/5) of
<br>
the attendees were laboratory spectroscopists and theoreticians who
<br>
were studying the formation of the molecules and dust particles.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;From my notes and John Mathis' (University of Wisconsin) summary talk,
<br>
one can say that the cosmic dust field is an extremely active field.
<br>
There is a flood of new observations, lab work and theoretical work,
<br>
representing a wide range of expertise (dust is fantastically
<br>
interdisciplinary) and applications, helped by the huge increase in
<br>
computing capability. The dust scientists' views are changing rapidly
<br>
about this subject, and has become more realistic, messy [... chaotic,
<br>
turbulent, much like life ... ].
<br>
<p>Some implications of this messiness is that:
<br>
<p>1) Observed quantities are only averages
<br>
2) Radiative transfer is uncertain
<br>
3) Grains move relative to the gas and to each other
<br>
4) Dust varies from place to place
<br>
<p>In spite of the above, some number of solid (heh) relationships hold
<br>
regarding dust particles' intensity and wavelength dependencies, mass
<br>
distributions and interstellar gas-phase depletions. One hundred
<br>
twenty different molecules in space have been discovered: these are
<br>
the building blocks of the dust particles that form from them, and
<br>
eventually become you and me. John Mathis ended the talk with some
<br>
interesting words that, 'these are not ordinary times and that some of
<br>
the most exciting decades in the history of astronomy lie before us
<br>
(and to let's keep on having fun)'.
<br>
<p>For me, the conference showed a startling transition in my own twenty
<br>
year life path, random-walking through astronomy. In 1988, during my
<br>
earlier scientific programing life at NASA-Ames, I worked for a year
<br>
for two astrophysicists; my project was to typeset (LaTeX) their
<br>
conference proceedings book: _IAU #135: Interstellar Dust_. At the
<br>
time in '88, I remember thinking that dust was a boring topic, but I
<br>
did a very good job on the book; it was one of the first Kluwer
<br>
conference books typeset completely in LaTeX, we developed our own
<br>
macros, those two astrophysicists wrote a complimentary letter to my
<br>
employer, Sterling Software, that resulted in a small bonus at the end
<br>
of the project.
<br>
<p>The Estes Park meeting was the next dust meeting since the previous
<br>
1988 gathering, and I was there, far from thinking that dust was
<br>
boring, and presenting my own dust topic. Startling. Since last
<br>
January, I've been working in Rome on astronomical infrared
<br>
spectroscopy and various cosmic dust topics. The move to Italy was not
<br>
easy, the early life in Italy has been difficult too, amplified
<br>
because I lost my partner the second week I arrived (and with that, my
<br>
main reason for living in Rome). However quasi-permanent astronomy
<br>
jobs are difficult to find anywhere in the world and so the good news
<br>
is that I have one of those, very interesting work, in a sunny
<br>
European place. [The bad news is that the salary is not enough to
<br>
cover basic living costs so that is my next challenge.] Those two
<br>
astrophysicists I worked for in 1988 were present at the Estes Park
<br>
meeting too, and were tickled that I was there in that capacity as a
<br>
dust scientist, and now seeing my obvious changes in the last fifteen
<br>
years, I think that I am tickled too.
<br>
<p>The people at the meeting were a mix of folks from different
<br>
countries- the largest one (half, perhaps) being the U.S., the rest
<br>
from The Netherlands, Japan, Germany, France, Italy, U.K, Australia,
<br>
others. We came to know each other fairly well because the astronomers
<br>
at this meeting were isolated- we had sleeping rooms, dormitory style,
<br>
in several large several story apartment buildings of a YMCA
<br>
conference center, and the meeting started each morning at 8:30am and
<br>
ended at ~11 pm. Meals were provided, no beer or wine at dinner or the
<br>
poster sessions (YMCA), but a lot of scenery of snow-capped mountains.
<br>
<p>Some words about cultures. Something about the U.S. culture (I don't
<br>
know what) promotes a sameness, a fear of 'being other'. Perhaps I'm
<br>
sensitive to these aspects, so then I'm only more affected than other
<br>
people, however, here is a story that might illustrate it.
<br>
<p>On May 30, Friday evening, I embarked, via buses, on a mini-journey
<br>
from my hotel near the Denver International Airport to the Aurora
<br>
Mall, in order to find a hardware type of store that might carry a
<br>
1/4-inch hex adaptor for my Black-and-Decker drill. My drill purchase
<br>
is new (bought in Rome)- necessary because my flat came to me bare and
<br>
I'm still needing to build cupboards to put away dishes, food, etc.
<br>
Unfortunately the Sears store at Aurora Mall in Denver did not have
<br>
the adaptor ('it is a specialty item' they said), and so I began my
<br>
trip back, adaptor-empty, from the Aurora Mall, back to my hotel. The
<br>
weather did not look nice, however, the clouds that were far on the
<br>
horizon when I left, were now black and they filled 1/3 of the sky. I
<br>
made it to my first bus transfer, then I had one more bus to take that
<br>
covered the last 15 miles to my hotel. I waited for that bus, and I
<br>
waited and waited, but no bus. Meanwhile, the clouds filled half the
<br>
sky, headed in my direction, the temperature dropped ten degrees (F),
<br>
and the lightning began.
<br>
<p>Still I waited at the bus stop, still no bus, and after one hour, I
<br>
began to get desperate, and I stuck out my thumb, in order to hitch a
<br>
ride from someone to my hotel. The road on which I was standing had two
<br>
two-lane sides, somewhat busy at 7pm, filled with many drivers with
<br>
SUVs and pickup trucks. But no one wanted to pick me up! A hundred cars
<br>
(or more) passed me, it was still light, many people surely saw me (I
<br>
made it a point to try to catch their vision). Was I strange-looking?
<br>
I don't know- I was essentially 'dressed for work' with a black silk
<br>
blouse, purple print skirt, stockings, black shoes. The strong wind
<br>
was me whipping me around, I was cold; this probably showed too.
<br>
<p>After those hundred or so cars passed my hitch-hiking thumb, one pulled
<br>
over- it was a young man named Juan, a Mexican, in a pickup truck. He
<br>
said he was drinking a little ('would I like a beer? or a cigarette?'
<br>
he asked), I could see an empty beer on his seat, but his speech and
<br>
driving didn't seem to be adversely affected, and he said that 'he wanted
<br>
to help, and where did I need to go'? 'To my hotel', I answered, and off
<br>
we went. Because he didn't recognize the names of the street
<br>
intersection of my hotel, and I didn't know the area at all, the path
<br>
was not straight,  and we had to stop and get directions once. In
<br>
about 30 minutes, however, he put me at my hotel, he wouldn't accept
<br>
my offered money for gas, and he drove away with a cheery wave.
<br>
<p>The moral of the story (if there is one) is that if you are stuck in
<br>
Colorado in a lightning storm, along a busy road dressed for work and
<br>
trying to hitch a ride, you might be viewed 'different enough' to the
<br>
drivers, that, instead of seeing a person in trouble, they are seeing
<br>
someone frightening to them, and therefore only another 'different
<br>
enough' person might be willing to help you. Since many people here
<br>
have had experiences of being viewed weirdly by the outside world,
<br>
my advice is: don't give up, accept yours and others differences,
<br>
respect those differences, and please don't get stuck in a
<br>
lightning storm!
<br>
