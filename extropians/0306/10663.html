<em>&gt; &gt; It's certain that some people recently felt as though they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; had been instructed *not* to reply to certain posts or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; posters.  But the list rules are clear:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;    If someone attacks your character, insults you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    or otherwise violates the above rule, do NOT
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    retaliate in like manner.  Instead, send us a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    complaint (to <a href="mailto:info@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20META:%20Free%20Speech%20on%20Extropians">info@extropy.org</a>) and take the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;    matter off-list.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; You see that it makes no mention whatsoever of not *replying*.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The few people who were asked not to reply to certain posts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or posters were giving a warning, as per the list rules.
</em><br>
<p>Warnings should be, according to the list rules, about
<br>
personal attacks, and, as I have shown above, should
<br>
not be an attempt to prevent people from replying.
<br>
<p>If this is clear, then we can all proceed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This was issued because there were more than 2 complaints
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about their language and their posts.   &quot;...do not retaliate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in like manner.&quot; means do not send a &quot;post&quot; in like manner.  
</em><br>
<p>Ah yes, exactly!  This was the problem!  They should perhaps
<br>
have been warned not to &quot;retaliate [or reply] in like manner&quot;,
<br>
which is quite different from not replying at all.
<br>
<p>So we see exactly the problem that has occurred.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Free speech is a given on the list, however list rules explicitly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state that ad hominem attacks are not allowed.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also stated is &quot;This is a private forum. We reserve the right
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to unsubscribe anyone at any time.&quot;  It seems far better to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asked to please refrain from continued posting to a person or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post that has caused a red flag than to be removed.
</em><br>
<p>Yes indeed.  But I see your paragraph here contains the same
<br>
error.  It asks people to refrain from posting to a person
<br>
or a post.  It fails to include the words &quot;in like manner&quot;.
<br>
Thus people were rightly made to think that an injunction 
<br>
against posting to people or posts *at all* had been made,
<br>
which I do not believe to have been the intent.
<br>
<p>My apologies for my clumsy attempts to resolve this offline,
<br>
and for which I will offer (offline) further regrets.
<br>
