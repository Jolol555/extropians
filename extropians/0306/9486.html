<p>
Martha Stewart was indicted yesterday for insider trading and for
<br>
obstruction of justice, and then forced to resign her position as CEO of her
<br>
own company. 
<br>
<p>I feel bad for her and for her broker at Merrill Lynch. Having once been a
<br>
Merrill broker for many years I have to sympathize with both her and him. 
<br>
<p>In my day I knew more than one &quot;insider-trader&quot; just like Martha. One client
<br>
of mine, a very rich man named Bob from xxxopolis, made many hundreds of
<br>
thousands of dollars using me as his Merrill broker. I suspected very
<br>
strongly that he was trading on so-called &quot;inside information.&quot; In fact I
<br>
had no doubts about it. However I did not say anything to him or to anyone
<br>
else about his trading patterns. Why should I have? 
<br>
<p>In other free-market countries, Taiwan for example, it is perfectly legal
<br>
and respectable to trade on so-called &quot;inside information.&quot; Why shouldn't it
<br>
be legal? The markets are about the free competition for information. 
<br>
<p>Why is it a crime in the USA to profit from information one has in one's own
<br>
brain that others don't have in theirs? Isn't knowledge and insight
<br>
something we should reward? Where in the US Constitution is it stated that
<br>
the federal government is granted the power to tell US citizens what they
<br>
can and cannot do with the business information contained in their own
<br>
brains? Who owns our brains, anyway? 
<br>
<p>I am so glad I'm no longer in that business. Fuck the feds. 
<br>
