</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Rafal, foreign workers who make 1/10th the amount ceded to American
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workers, may do well for themselves in their own country, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cannot afford to buy American cars, American steel, Anerican-made
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chips, American financial services. It costs too damn much and they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be insane to improverish themselves. Very few Indians, for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, can afford to buy an American Pontiac Sunfire (should they
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>### Well, as they say, tough. If, as you seem to imply, Americans can't or
<br>
don't want to compete, they don't deserve to be paid.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Until then, degrading the American middle classes ability to purchase
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goods from around the world, by exporting their jobs is not a wise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move. Without a decent short-term, we will not in any fashion have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; long term.
</em><br>
<p>### The US middle class has a decent life already. Sacrificing long-term
<br>
growth for the sake of minor short-term improvements is a loss. A Crown Vic
<br>
instead of a Taurus today means the LongLife(TM) pill could come just a few
<br>
months too late for many.
