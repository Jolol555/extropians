<br>
conversations on this list, I'm from the middle east, I speak arabic, and I 
<br>
spent a few weeks in the region this past December.  Of course I read the 
<br>
middle eastern papers.  I also keep up with the content published in the Arabic 
<br>
versions that doesn't show up in the English translations.
<br>
<p>MEZ,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then laugh all you want if you are amused but tell me why you are 
<br>
pushing the Arab party line instead of admitting the truth.  Your people hate us 
<br>
because of who and what we are.  They don't like our women, they don't like our 
<br>
men, our TV, our movies or our way of life.  I have even read when they 
<br>
didn't like for men to wear our Levi's because they are too revealing and they feel 
<br>
contaminated shaking the hand of one of our women in an American business 
<br>
setting.  Instead you want to make it sound as if we have deeply offended you on 
<br>
some deep level and that the evidence we have found is non existent.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Heck after more than fifty years your people can't even tell the truth 
<br>
about Israel nor admit they have a right to live except at your mercy.
