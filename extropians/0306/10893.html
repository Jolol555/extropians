Since everyone (?) is so happy about the money that
<br>
the fed is about to hand back to us, perhaps it's time
<br>
to spread it around a bit.
<br>
<p>After all, the amount of goods and services hasn't
<br>
changed.  There will simply be more dollars chasing
<br>
them.  The actual good part is that the money will be
<br>
spend by private individuals instead of the fed. 
<br>
That's nice.  The bad part is that, like all transfer
<br>
payments, some people will get back a much higher
<br>
percentage of what was forcibly stolen from them to
<br>
begin with than others.
<br>
<p>As a working single person without dependent children,
<br>
I will get $300, I understand, while the slovenly
<br>
breeders across the street, whose kids graduate
<br>
straight into the local gangs from 8th grade will get
<br>
$400 per cretin to spend on more booze, louder booms
<br>
for their cars, etc.
<br>
<p>I can beat that, however.  All I have to do is marry
<br>
someone with a whole passel of kids.  I'm sure that
<br>
there are any number of mothers in Africa who would be
<br>
so very happy for me to marry them, and I'll split the
<br>
tax savings down the middle with them, which will mean
<br>
$100~$200 or so per year per child going to them,
<br>
which would be a major windfall in many areas of
<br>
Africa, easilly enough to make the difference between
<br>
living and dying.  They can stay in Africa, as I can't
<br>
afford to bring them all here - even with the standard
<br>
deductions, etc.  I will save money - they will make
<br>
money - and the fed will be screwed. 
<br>
<p>Oh happy day!
<br>
<p>Anybody know the rules on how many wives you can have
<br>
if your marriage is entirely outside the U.S. jurisdiction?
