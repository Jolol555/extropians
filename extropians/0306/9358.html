</em><br>
<p>### I fully agree here. The DA should indeed reduce the estimate I might
<br>
have of our civilization surviving much longer.
<br>
<p>However, I do not have a clear estimate of civilization lifespan. We have so
<br>
little data, that any lifespan between a few thousand years and infinity is
<br>
possible (cannot be excluded with some plausible reasoning). I do not have
<br>
an intuition, no definite prior about whether sentient species usually fail
<br>
before spreading in space, or not. Therefore, reducing my estimate downwards
<br>
has very little meaning - a non-number reduced by a finite ratio is still a
<br>
non-number.
<br>
<p>As I wrote before, the DA tries to wring too much understanding out of too
<br>
little data, and its use in decision-making is very limited. Also, I don't
<br>
think it can be an argument for pessimism and long-range defeatism, as some
<br>
people (not you) are applying it.
