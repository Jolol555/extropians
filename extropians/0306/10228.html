<em>&gt; &gt; You know, I hear that the US troops occupying Iraq
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; are driving up to towns, and searching house to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; house for hidden weapons. It appears some Iraqis are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; signalling their arrival to others by flickering their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; porch lights.  Hmmm, citizens warning their fellows
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; about occupying troops coming to search for guns,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; using lights.... I seem to have heard something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; similar to that before somewhere, maybe from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; elementary school.... help me out here Ron...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; To which Lee... responds:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Doesn't it bother you at all that you would consider
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Baathist murderers to be analogous to the U.S.'s
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; original revolutionaries and founders?  Those like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Saddam Hussein ---criminals against humanity of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; first degree--- need to be hunted down after they lose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; wars!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Which leads us to notice... the missing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; piece of the puzzle:  what is the truth about the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; porch-light-flickerers?  Are they remnants of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Baathist regime, color them criminal, or are they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yankee-go-home Iraqis, color them how: troublesome,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uncooperative, unwise, patriotic?  I don't know.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess we'll find out.
</em><br>
<p>The occupying forces have to be asking themselves (and
<br>
have asked) the same question.  It would be so nice to
<br>
know their precise assessment (with no chance of spin).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What we can hope is that the US actors improve the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation rapidly enough so that the Iraqis are won
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over and cooperate by turning in or self-enforcing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; violently intransigent.  I'm not optimistic that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Bush crew will achieve so optimal an outcome.
</em><br>
<p>Nor am I.  I'm not even optimistic that we can know
<br>
if they do:  by what criteria are we to distinguish
<br>
background criminal behavior from organized resistance?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; By the way, I was conflicted on the war.
</em><br>
<p>I'm impressed.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There were pros and cons...What finally put me in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opposition was the combination of three factors:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the poor US record vis a vis nation building, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extreme &quot;degree of difficulty&quot; of such an undertaking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in Arabistan,
</em><br>
<p>Quite!  Most of us share a common though inexact notion
<br>
of what it means for things to &quot;work out well&quot; in some
<br>
country or other.  We are often dismayed by ongoing
<br>
processes in nations, processes that seem definitely
<br>
worse than processes in our own western nations.
<br>
Forgetting all the realpolitik, just how much can you
<br>
do to assist others at little cost?  The eternal question!
<br>
<p>Araby---from Palestinian poverty to Sudan slavery---is
<br>
pretty screwed up.  Assessing the occupying powers'
<br>
success against this backdrop is (no surprise) difficult.
<br>
Yep, we can *hope* for few casualties, increased freedom,
<br>
and wealth production and increase, but that, of course
<br>
is pretty easy to do, safely thousands of miles away living
<br>
in comfort.
<br>
<p>Does it matter to you whether *our* hands are dirty,
<br>
or mainly the total death and destruction?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; and the (to me) seeming implausibility of the notion
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that born-on-second-base-thinks-he-scored-a-triple GB2
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be up to the task.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; OK.  Cheap shot.
</em><br>
<p>;-)  Sure---you are entitled to at least one cheap shot
<br>
for having been so constructive.  As much as I take refuge
<br>
in the fact that anyone elected to office today will
<br>
probably have the full resources of their large governments
<br>
at their disposal, and that the policies will probably be
<br>
rational even if not wise, it's still dismaying that evidently
<br>
the Administration and the State Department don't agree on
<br>
policy.
