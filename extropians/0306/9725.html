<p><em>&gt; Now Rafel, as you well know &quot;We&quot; are the people of the US and its several
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states.  If you wish to do dope of any kind including my old favorite Scotch then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; get the law changed but don't act indignant.
</em><br>
<p>But there isn't really a &quot;we&quot;.  The Bill of Rights and a whole bunch
<br>
of ammendments to the Constitution had to do with protecting the
<br>
rights of the minorities (or in some cases, e.g. prohibition,
<br>
trying to control what was probably a majority).
<br>
<p>Historically government has been in large part about control (e.g. cultures
<br>
like Burma, China, Singapore, etc. that now attempt to control speech or
<br>
access to information).  &quot;We&quot; largely solved that problem, i.e. you can
<br>
speak freely, but you cannot speak freely in a way that endangers people
<br>
(e.g. shouting &quot;fire&quot; in a theatre when there is none).
<br>
<p>That is the key thing (and the thing we do not have in &quot;drug&quot; legislation,
<br>
prosecution, etc. in the U.S. at this time).  I.E. The strategy should be
<br>
that you get to exercise your rights to consume mind altering substances
<br>
but *only* up to the point where they do not impact on my rights (esp.
<br>
safety).  Regulations regarding drunk driving seem to be slowly moving in
<br>
that direction (WA state is one of those that has lowered the maximum
<br>
blood alcohol level criteria for drunk driving, setup stricter rules
<br>
regarding young people consuming alcohol, etc.)  And then of course one
<br>
has the &quot;automatic&quot; regulation of road speeds that seems to be developing
<br>
in the U.K.
<br>
<p>So slowly we seem to be moving in the direction of regulating the
<br>
potential consequences and not the actual actions themselves -- but that
<br>
has *not* hit most drug legislation in the U.S. yet.  Interestingly, if
<br>
one looks at the lawsuits against the tobacco distributors, there is a
<br>
trend that companies that produce long term negative secondary impacts on
<br>
society (e.g. second hand smoke) may be held liable.  But if selling drugs
<br>
is illegal there is no company to sue. So how this will all play out
<br>
remains to be seen.
