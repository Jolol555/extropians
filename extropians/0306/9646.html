<p>Here's a recent view to the contrary; I have no opinion:
<br>
<p>By FRED PEARCE
<br>
New Scientist
<br>
<p>Smoke is clouding our view of global warming, protecting the planet from
<br>
perhaps three-quarters of the greenhouse effect. That might sound like good
<br>
news, but experts say that as the cover diminishes in coming decades, we
<br>
are in for a dramatic escalation of warming that could be two or even three
<br>
times as great as official best guesses.
<br>
<p>This was the dramatic conclusion reached last week at a workshop in Dahlem,
<br>
Berlin, where top atmospheric scientists got together, including Nobel
<br>
laureate Paul Crutzen and Swedish meteorologist Bert Bolin, former chairman
<br>
of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). 
<br>
<p>IPCC scientists have suspected for a decade that aerosols of smoke and
<br>
other particles from burning rainforest, crop waste and fossil fuels are
<br>
blocking sunlight and counteracting the warming effect of carbon dioxide
<br>
emissions. Until now, they reckoned that aerosols reduced greenhouse
<br>
warming by perhaps a quarter, cutting increases by 0.2 °C. So the 0.6 °C of
<br>
warming over the past century would have been 0.8 °C without aerosols.
<br>
<p>But the Berlin workshop concluded that the real figure is even higher -
<br>
aerosols may have reduced global warming by as much as three-quarters,
<br>
cutting increases by 1.8 °C. If so, the good news is that aerosols have
<br>
prevented the world getting almost two degrees warmer than it is now. But
<br>
the bad news is that the climate system is much more sensitive to
<br>
greenhouse gases than previously guessed. [etc]
