<em>&gt; The use of indexicals here such as &quot;this world&quot; and &quot;our levels&quot; is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misleading.  If this world is a simulation, then this world may be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considerably more exciting than its previous version.  I don't feel like I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have a good measure of how &quot;exciting&quot; our world is.  You seem to take it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the answer is &quot;not very exciting&quot;, but I don't see it that way at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; all.
</em><br>
<p>I am equating technological advances and virtual reality toys.  We can't simulate entire universes in our current existence.  But
<br>
the Simulators obviously can.  Their level of virtual reality, computing power, and technological advancement must be immeasurably
<br>
superior to ours.  Whatever you find exciting about our escalating level of technology, they've been there, done that, and moved on.
<br>
That's what I call exciting!  On any continuum between pre-singularity and post-singularity, I would assume that the previous world
<br>
is more boring than the later world!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the argument about suffering, I think this is argument is utterly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misplaced.  I don't need a posthuman theodicy to think that there's a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable chance that an interested posthuman with arbitrarily large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources might rehearse the brief history of life on Earth in ver mind,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; perhaps in great detail, and that's all it takes to get the sim argument
</em><br>
<em>&gt; off the ground.
</em><br>
<p>But to give us the ability to feel pain, to make us conscious of our pain, and then to submit us all into the world of suffering
<br>
needlessly....  That's hard to imagine.  I don't think any of us would do that.  If we are simulations of the Creators' ancestors,
<br>
then they are our descendants in the future.  Can we extrapolate a scenario where we will become transhuman, immortal, and
<br>
ultimately powerful, ...and then recreate a world of suffering that we have ourselves escaped?  This does not seem very likely to
<br>
me.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; argument amounts to saying that in most sim universes, movies like The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Matrix would be prevented by physics itself.  A cool superhero movie would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be possible, but considering the brain-in-a-vat case wouldn't...?  This
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems absurd.  Why wouldn't they just let us consider the possibility
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without giving us a practical use for this information?
</em><br>
<p>But this would break the simulation.  Because in the real world, people might ponder such things uselessly.  They aren't in a
<br>
simulation, so none of their attempts to detect the simulation, prove it, and break it would work.  But in a simulation, these very
<br>
same actions could cause problems.  We might discover proof and redirect the history of the simulation as we demonstrate this to
<br>
everybody.  We might find a way to hack the simulation and start reprogramming it or try to communicate to the real world.  If we
<br>
couldn't get that far, we could all just commit suicide to end the simulation, or all act inappropriately to ruin the historical
<br>
recreation, or overload the system with a denial of service attack by doing a lot of things that are much harder to calculate and
<br>
simulate.  These actions must be possible, or, they must be prevented by security features in the simulation.  If these security
<br>
features are there, we should be able to detect them as our attempts fail.  But it seems much simpler and more direct in design if
<br>
we were merely prevented from having the idea of hacking our way out of the simulation in the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course, this flies in the face of Hanson's &quot;How to Live in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Simulation&quot; paper, (which advocates that, in a simulation, you should try
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be interesting, entertaining, praiseworthy, and all around impressive,)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially in light of your argument that they'd NEVER simulate a world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like ours because it would be too boring.
</em><br>
<p>I find that argument to be unconvincing.  If we can't effect how the simulation is being run by getting the interest or attention of
<br>
our Simulators, then it would be futile to alter our behavior.  On the other hand, if they did tweak the simulation based on our
<br>
actions, we would have examples of miracles or non-sequiturs all the time.  Maybe they could carefully modify the game without it
<br>
being noticed.  But this would change the argument from a simulation to a directly-controlled scenario or game.  I think such
<br>
control would make our universe appear less arbitrary or more directed or would be detectable in some way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; With that said, I think that *because* your excitement and suffering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; arguments fail, so does the argument from pragmatism gain force.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; On the other hand, I said:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Here, I think, you have missed the point of this argument.  Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; transhumanists still seem to believe that *we* will create simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; environments, in which it will be impossible for our simulated subjects to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; falsify the claim that they are in a simulation.  This is a solid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; prediction that makes claims about what kinds of worlds there will be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; namely, that there will be some simulated worlds that we'll make.
</em><br>
<p>This leads into my further extrapolation:  If we intend to create such worlds, and we postulate that if we are in a simulation that
<br>
it would probably be a simulation of the Simulators' ancestors, then they are probably our descendants derived from our own future
<br>
history.  This gives us a lot better predictive power concerning the simulation than if they were totally alien.  Of course, they
<br>
may be so advanced to be unrelated to us in any significant way, but it still is much closer than a randomly different and alien
<br>
culture out there.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But it is precisely the point that we'll have no practical tests for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether we're in a simulation for quite a long time, if ever.  Therefore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is no prediction being made here: only a prediction in combination
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a metaphysical view.
</em><br>
<p>You need a professional hacker!  They are great for figuring out how to detect, probe, evaluate, and ultimately manipulate remote
<br>
unseen computing forces by using ordinary communications and interactions in such a way as to get unexpected results.  If we are in
<br>
a simulation, a hacker should be able to figure it out.
<br>
<p>(Hmmm...  unless the hackers capable of doing this are programmed to disbelieve that we are in a simulation so they never try!
<br>
Nah...!)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There's something wrong with this, but it's not the verification
</em><br>
<em>&gt; principle: the problem is that the information in question is useless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We should act the same regardless of whether we're in a *detailed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman* simulation.  Hanson can't give you any advice for such a case,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and neither can anyone else.
</em><br>
<p>This is what makes this argument so fun.  I don't think it should have any influence on how we behave, what we choose to do, our
<br>
goals, or our methods.  In short, life goes on as if we aren't in a simulation even if we are.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Name me one transhumanist who wants to build a world as mundane as this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; one with our levels of tragedy and suffering.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; At times, Tipler seems to argue that we would be simulated (or, as he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; calls it, &quot;resurrected&quot;) precisely as we were, and/or in certain kinds of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indistinguishable &quot;educational worlds&quot; that would teach us to be better;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hence any Tiplerian transhumanists of that vein would meet my criteria.
</em><br>
<p>OK, that's one!  I keep forgetting that creationism and reincarnation are coming at me from two different fronts!  How odd...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Certainly many of us have entertained the idea of ancestor-simulations in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we took to be a realistic fashion, though I don't think anyone has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gone to the mat arguing that we WILL do ancestor-simulations.  If you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doubt me, I suppose I can go archive-diving, but I won't slog through that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pointless task merely for your amusement. ;)
</em><br>
<p>Our current archives don't seem as realistic as the simulated history we are talking about.  :-)
