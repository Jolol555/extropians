</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; QED?

<em>&gt; No, unfortunately, as far as I can tell, we have *enough* 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; computing power available for AI now.  Yes, right now.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *More* computing power will make it *easier*, again 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfortunately so.  At least with current computing power
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  it should still be fairly *hard* for the standard flounder-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around style of AI to get anywhere.
</em><br>
<p>Unfortunately so? It seems that you are not particular 
<br>
confident that Friendly AI is the most likely AI to emerge
<br>
Eliezer. That there are substantial risks in having more 
<br>
potential AI &quot;creators&quot; running amok. Perhaps it is my relative
<br>
ignorance that is causing me to not see the risks in the same
<br>
way that you do. Perhaps you can educate some of us
<br>
who are inadequately on guard.
<br>
<p>To me the word &quot;friendly&quot; has connotations of sociability 
<br>
and I see most (perhaps even all) sociable creatures as 
<br>
sociable out of evolutionary need.
<br>
<p>I wonder what friendly AI could mean operationally in the 
<br>
context of an AI.
<br>
<p>Consider sociopaths. They are good observers of patterns
<br>
and are able to simulate empathy which they apparently
<br>
don't feel.  I think there has been research that shows that
<br>
all children learn to lie but the brighter ones learn earlier
<br>
(crudely speaking).
<br>
<p>If one meets or even creates an ostensibly friendly AI 
<br>
how does one *know* it is *truly* friendly? 
<br>
<p>I think an interesting opening question to that AI might be
<br>
what does &quot;friendly&quot; mean?
<br>
<p>Its also possible that in relation to friendly AI humans 
<br>
might have different notions of friendliness. For some a
<br>
friendly AI may be one constantly vigilant to the emergence
<br>
of unfriendly AI's and engaged in chasing foolish childlike
<br>
humans away from technologies that may result in such.
<br>
For others this sort of paternalistic protection would not
<br>
seem like friendliness but a curtailment of their liberties.
<br>
<p>Seems the question might become &quot;friendly&quot; by whose 
<br>
terms. My hypothetical Rottweiler might be very &quot;friendly&quot;
<br>
and protective to me but not so &quot;friendly&quot; to cats or other
<br>
people it regards as a threat to me.
<br>
<p>Human draw boundaries in places that are not entirely
<br>
logical. We may for instance grant human rights to a 
<br>
comatose &quot;vegetative&quot; person on life support but not to
<br>
a healthy chimpanzee. How would a &quot;friendly&quot; AI 
<br>
(neither human nor chimp) respond in the allocation of
<br>
resources and the enforcements of rights I wonder. And
<br>
more to the point do you think, however it acted, its
<br>
actions would be regarded as &quot;friendly&quot; by all people?
<br>

<br>
