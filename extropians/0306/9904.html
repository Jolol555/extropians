<em>&gt; My former colleagues nicknamed me &quot;The Wizard&quot; because of my intense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; preoccupation with statistics and technical analysis. For years they
</em><br>
looked
<br>
<em>&gt; to me for advice about short term market trends. They were horrified when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one day I stood up and proclaimed that the Emperor is wearing no clothes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -gts
</em><br>
<p>Do You have some kind of reference to things that have been researched and
<br>
proved not to be useful for predicting stock prices? Like for instance
<br>
technical analysis patterns etc. ( i'm quite sure that most well known
<br>
patterns are of no use whatsoever)
<br>
<p>I have a very hard time getting hold of historic stock data that are precise
<br>
enough to do research on. Especially information about analyst estimates and
<br>
sec filings seem to be a little hard to get at. I also need to know when
<br>
dividends were paid out, and when stocks were split, and merged etc. Zacks
<br>
data is quite expensive and on top of that, many of the interesting values
<br>
are not stored in a way that i can see what date they became publicly known.
<br>
Just getting hold of the data will be quite a challenge.
<br>
<p>I hope to have taken my own historic data off the net during the next couple
<br>
of years.
<br>
<p>My plan for the next couple of years is somewhat identical to the work you
<br>
seem to have done previously  - to shoot down as many trading strategies as
<br>
possible, and perhaps, if i'm lucky, find a few that seem to work.
<br>
<p>Until i have more results, i'll keep investing like i have started out.
<br>
Being long seemingly undervalued stocks, and being short anything
<br>
real-estate related that is also priced high on book value, earnings and has
<br>
a bad debt/equity ratio.
<br>
<p>Reason for this setup is that i think i have a good system of calculating
<br>
intristic value ( so i should be able to get a few good value stocks through
<br>
my screens ) and because i think the dollar will fall significantly against
<br>
most other currencies, and the us real-estate market will collapse measured
<br>
in average us-citizen income.
