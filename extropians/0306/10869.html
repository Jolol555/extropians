<em>&gt;&gt; The psychological problem that most people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; against uploading, of course, is that of &quot;being
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; inside a computer&quot;, or of knowing that one is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just on a silicon chip.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps its because I haven't read enough about it, but,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reservation, I have against uploading, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics is that I just not convinced that, appearances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not withstanding, the me that goes in, will be the me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that comes out.
</em><br>
<p>With cryonics, most people are concerned about the uncertainty of the
<br>
technology being able to adequately repair the damage, both pre-existing age
<br>
and disease-related, and the damage caused by the cryonic processes itself.
<br>
<p>But it appears your concern is of more of a philosophical nature related to
<br>
the nature of personal identity.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps it is a bit different between uploading and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics because uploading changes the matter substrate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on which one perceives one exists more radically.
</em><br>
<p>I would have *much* more confidence in uploading to a more robust and high
<br>
performance substrate compared to risking the damage of freezing and
<br>
restoring my biological substrate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let's stipulate that the means to do a complete atomic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; level recreation of all parts of a cryonically preserved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person, including the sense of self, and a consistent set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of memories from one's early childhood up until the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; moment one voluntarily consented to undergo a cryonic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedure. Like consenting to a life saving general
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anaesthetic. Let's assume the nanotech is good enough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to rebuild the exact atomic replica of person X.
</em><br>
<p>So you've duplicated the complete physical body, at some moment in time, to
<br>
the atomic level.  To me, that appears to be sufficient, but I realize many
<br>
persons *feel* and suspect we are more than physical machines and they
<br>
search for that something special in terms of quantum theory, mysticism, or
<br>
non-materialistic philosophy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; My current sense is that, to everyone else person X
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *will* appear to be the *same* person both before
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and after. Person X prime, (Xprime), will perceive himself
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be person X, but it seems to me that neither Xprime's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion, nor the opinions of other people are fully
</em><br>
<em>&gt; satisfactory when one puts oneself in the place of person
</em><br>
<em>&gt; X considering undergoing cryonics or uploading. It seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that person X's predisposition to cryonics or uploading is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something of a leap of faith or perhaps the sense of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing little to lose.
</em><br>
<p>If X, and all his friends observe that he is the same in all measurable
<br>
ways, then what could be missing?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can X know that Xprime is any more than a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete copy? The same process that reproduced one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Xprime from the information in X could also produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple copies.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, the idea of multiple copies is outside our experience and threatening
<br>
to our evolved sense of self, and raises some interesting questions of how
<br>
society would deal with their presence, but I don't see anything paradoxical
<br>
about the concept.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me try and use what seems to be an appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogy. A candle flame, 'energy' can be transferred or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread from one candle (a matter substrate) to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without being extinguished. The flame might also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinguished on the original substrate and relit. Or with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology we may rebuilt a candle that, atom by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atom, is the same as the original candle and relight it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the *particular* flame, the *particular* energy flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the substrate will still have been interrupted. Indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will have been snuffed out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems to me that &quot;death&quot; may be analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; candle flame (i.e. a continuous flow of energy dancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a matter substrate). Because we eat and exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atoms throughout our lives the analogy could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended to say wax is added to the candle whilst the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flame continues to burn. But, extinguish the flame, stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the continuous energy flow, and perhaps you extinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the continuing phenomena, the 'super-consciousness',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to coin a term covering conscious and unconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes) that are the subjective experience of life. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess what I'm positing is that, one's life, one's self,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may depends on continuity. Perhaps something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important to the identity of a person is lost if the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flow or 'super-conscious' is interrupted. Actually the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness is interrupted sometimes in life but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with the unconscious so far as I know.
</em><br>
<p><p>People have been completely &quot;brain dead&quot; for significant periods of time and
<br>
then revived with no loss of personal identity.  (However it is open to
<br>
debate whether their soul got bored and departed.)
<br>
<p>I'm not aware of anything physical that is truly continuous as you describe
<br>
it. If you look closely you see that pieces of the universe appear to be
<br>
moving around in interesting patterns.  To me, the patterns carry all the
<br>
information, and are all that's really of interest.  A subset of those
<br>
patterns is organized in such a way that it thinks it is separate, and
<br>
perceives a &quot;self&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Following a successful cryonics procedure everyone,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including the reconstructed X, Xprime, thinks X has
</em><br>
<em>&gt; been preserved, this I freely concede. But X the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; original, is no longer around or in a position to confirm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that X the original, X's super-consciousness, X's self,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rather than an excellent replication has actually emerged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the process.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So, does it finally come down to a &quot;leap of faith&quot; on behalf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the potential cryonaut or the potential upload that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *they*, X, will *actually* survive?
</em><br>
<p>But why does it matter?  There's no need for a leap of faith if everything
<br>
works as before.  Your X-prime would know this intuitively.  He would be the
<br>
same as before, and much more the same person than he was a week ago, or a
<br>
year ago, or 20 years ago.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Or, and this I would like to be convinced of, are there in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact deeper levels of understanding still available to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inquiring mind, *this* side of the cryonics or upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedure, perhaps in physics, or perhaps around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or avoiding) the fuzzy phenomenon I've termed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-conscious, that would allow one to more rationally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid the sense that the prospective cryonaut or upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are undertaking a one way journey that is in many ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every bit as much a &quot;leap of faith&quot; for them as the &quot;leaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of faith&quot; taken by people of religious viewpoints since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time immemorial?
</em><br>
<p>I remember going through similar thoughts in my past, and feeling like I was
<br>
abandoning the cultural framework I had acquired as a child, and traveling
<br>
into the void.  Coming out the other side, with no visible means of support,
<br>
I felt more liberated, more confident, and free of much excessive baggage.
