</em><br>
<p>I have to agree with Michael Dickey here. Blaming coalition forces for
<br>
Iraqi deaths is like blaming hostage rescuers for deaths of hostages in
<br>
the hands of insane terrorists. It is the classic hostage taker to
<br>
negotiator, &quot;Now see what you made me do&quot; moral equivalency horse
<br>
puckey.
<br>
<p>Especially considering how surgical the allied operation was, with
<br>
probably the smallest percentage of civilian deaths of any war in
<br>
history, it is specifically criminal to accuse the coalition forces of
<br>
being no better than Saddam.
<br>
<p>I'm not suprised at all by this attitude. The left has been getting
<br>
ever more hostile to US administrations, esp GOP administrations, since
<br>
Ronald Reagan, especially GOP administrations that consistently prove
<br>
leftist theory to be abjectly wrong and morally bankrupt. 
<br>
<p>Ron Reagan faced down the Soviets and made them blink: the left thought
<br>
he was gonna cause Armageddon (they were wrong). Reagan enacted the
<br>
then largest tax break in US history, which ended the Carter recession,
<br>
double digit inflation and unemployment, and presided over the then
<br>
longest economic expansion in US history, DESPITE democrats controlling
<br>
congress increasing spending on welfare entitlements faster than at any
<br>
time in US history. Bush I finished the Cold War, brought Noriega to
<br>
trial, flagged Kuwaiti tankers, and assembled the largest military
<br>
force since WWII and won the most decisive military victory in history
<br>
in the shortest time, and the left could only make jokes about his
<br>
inability to handle a grocery store bar code scanner.
<br>
<p>Bush II has done even better and there is nothing that makes the left
<br>
steam like GOP success. The problem is that they need to invent
<br>
scandals where none exist to match GOP investigation of scandals in the
<br>
Clinton White House that were real. I'm just waiting for the left to
<br>
invent a new White House Intern...
