Um....doesn't Betterhumans count as an extropian publishing company? It
<br>
certainly makes more sense to join up with existing forces than branch off
<br>
anew with others.
<br>
<p>From my point of view, all of the transhumanist/extropian news and content
<br>
sites online form a sort of greater collective. They just need to be tied
<br>
closer together and pool their communities. The first steps towards that end
<br>
are being taken at the moment; efforts like the TLE
<br>
(<a href="http://www.imminst.org/twa/">http://www.imminst.org/twa/</a>), the transhumanist-webmasters group
<br>
(<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/transhumanist-webmasters/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/transhumanist-webmasters/</a>), the work David
<br>
has been doing with the ExI lists/BBS integration (hopefully soon to be
<br>
replicated for the WTA), and so forth.

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe as extropians we are bound to draw closer together over the
<br>
course
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of the next few decades (or centuries) and we ought to seriously
<br>
consider
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;clever, economical, and downright cool strategies that might enhance our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;understanding and appreciation of these final, historic, pre-singularity
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;days.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;................
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;This prompts me to voice one thing I have noticed about the list in
<br>
general (from my viewpoint anyway)  As a group I think we are adding to
<br>
extropy. At the same time, we are all doing it through individual efforts.
<br>
Other than regional meetings, etc., Extropianism seems to be a very solitary
<br>
affair. Where each of us is still waging  our daily war with the everyday
<br>
problems of life. We still have to work, pay bills and live in our own
<br>
houses,  with no help from fellow extropes other than rare snippets of
<br>
advise.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Pooling our talents in a collective pot would seem a very obvious and
<br>
hopefully profitable endeavour. Maybe we should forward a few ideas for an
<br>
extropian business? we are all online and im sure many of us would be very
<br>
happy to devote time and knowledge if we had a financial gain. We already
<br>
have Writers, researchers and probably everything we need to start an online
<br>
publishing company.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe a new everyday life list would help, where we could exchange ideas
<br>
and advise on everyday things. Such as health, finances even just swap
<br>
recipes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;with a group of people this big, with such a broad range of skills, there
<br>
must be dozens if not hundreds of things we could do collectively. That
<br>
could make our lives just a little bit easier.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Any Ideas? how about a proposal for an experiment, to see if we can
<br>
achieve something like a small business?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Alex
