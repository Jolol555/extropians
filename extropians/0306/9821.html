Rick Dill is father to Jan Dill, 30 years old with Down Syndrome.
<br>
<p><p>Mike,
<br>
<p>Your experience is a great match for my oldest son.  He never was put on
<br>
drugs but he was abused by fellow students and the occasional teacher
<br>
who found him easy to pick on.  He left high school with only one
<br>
friend.  In college and later as a grunt in the army he recovered .. now
<br>
is married, writing computer games, and socially OK.  His IQ is much
<br>
higher than mine.  His life functionality is yet to be measured because
<br>
that takes many years.
<br>
<p>Your view doesn't fit well into the world of DS and ADHD.  My daughter
<br>
(DS, high achieving and a pioneer) is certainly borderline if not full
<br>
ADHD.  She learned to be tough and think for herself (even if a little
<br>
simply).  What would you expect from two hyper parents.
<br>
<p>It also doesn't fit the S.O.[Special Olympics] gymnast, Chris, I trained
<br>
(off meds) in the little team that I set up so my own kid would have
<br>
gymnastics.  Chris was at the extreme but wonderful.  I have incredible
<br>
pride (as he does) for his achievements that went on in spite of me.
<br>
<p>Eventually his behaviours became more than even his (truly loving)
<br>
parents could cope with and he was moved to Pathfinder Village where he
<br>
was able to develop into a pretty functional young man (as of last time
<br>
I saw him).
<br>
<p>ADHD is not something simple and maybe it is far over-diagnosed.  Hey, I
<br>
got through without being diagnosed dislexic and that is one of my
<br>
advantages in life.  I look at things differently than other people and
<br>
sometimes that is really valuable.
<br>
<p>Your story, while interesting to me, seems pretty irrelevant in dealing
<br>
with kids with DS who have extreme problems.  Simple problems .. now
<br>
that is just developing some character and spirit of independence and I
<br>
have to support that strongly.
<br>
<p>You wrote (among other things): &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In fifth grade I spent more
<br>
days in detention than not. I had C and D grades. I was forced to learn
<br>
at the same dull and snails pace as the rest of the idiots[WATCH THAT
<br>
WORDING] and was bored out of my skull. Misbehaved to the point of
<br>
wrestling matches with my teacher.  Got corporal punishment from the
<br>
principal (ruler on the wrist). &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>Rick ... Dad to 30 year old Jan (DS, maybe ADHD and AML)
<br>
