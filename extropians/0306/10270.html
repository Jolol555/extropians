</em><br>
<p>No, I said it was not noticeably strong evidence in favor of that 
<br>
conclusion, and objected only to Harvey saying that it was not evidence at 
<br>
all.  There are a thousand reasons I might dislike Bush, aside from liking 
<br>
the old regime in Iraq.  If it comes down to that, I disliked Bush I, 
<br>
Clinton, and would have disliked Reagan if I'd been old enough at the 
<br>
time.  I would have disliked Carter.  It seems to me that we've been going 
<br>
steadily from bad to worse, perhaps with one blip for Bush I, who may have 
<br>
been slightly better than Reagan.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In this case C, who conjectures that B supports X, should *ask*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;why shouldn't an attack on A in these circumstances be regarded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as support of X?&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Why not?  Because life is not a two-sided zero-sum game, that's why not.
<br>
<p>It is *ridiculous* to suppose that *anyone* on the Extropians mailing 
<br>
list, regardless of their other politics, supports Hussein.  The prior 
<br>
probability is so low that making such a comment is either an ad hominem 
<br>
debating tactic, or human tribal thinking resulting in the sheer STUPIDITY 
<br>
and WARPING of intellect necessary to distort one's probabilities THAT FAR 
<br>
away from the simple COMMON SENSE that NOBODY on the Extropians mailing 
<br>
list is likely to support Hussein!  What is going on here cannot possibly 
<br>
be Bayesian reasoning.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; You did not respond to my &quot;lip-service&quot; remark.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think that perhaps if B every so often paid lip-service by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; denouncing X, the problems would be less severe.  (Perhaps you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have done this sufficiently enough in your eyes.)
</em><br>
<p>That's not what's going on.  Foaming tribalist fanatics such as are now 
<br>
appearing on this mailing list - there is no point in mincing words - are 
<br>
not attempting to use &quot;Bayesian reasoning&quot; or even &quot;rationality&quot;; they are 
<br>
acting on blind instinct and pure emotion.  They are thinking in terms of 
<br>
the two-sided zero-sum game; anyone who does not support Bush must support 
<br>
Hussein, even when this conclusion runs in total defiance of simple common 
<br>
sense about the prior odds.  That is how human tribalist thinking works. 
<br>
One need only pick up a history book to see this.  I do not need to invent 
<br>
more elaborate explanations for this behavior.  Tribal polarization is a 
<br>
human universal and it is quite, quite stupid.  I will *not* pay 
<br>
lip-service to it.  That ugly part of human nature is *my* enemy.
