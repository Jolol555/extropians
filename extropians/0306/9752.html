<p>I think these questions were nicely answered in Hal's post. 
<br>
<p>As The Straight Dope puts it: &quot;To put it in technical terms, general 
<br>
relativity is only self-consistent if the speed of gravity is Lorentz 
<br>
invariant (that is, the same for all observers), and the only speed for 
<br>
which that works is c&quot;.
<br>
<p>Beside the theoretical observations based on neutron-star orbit
<br>
stability people also have done some direct experimental speed tests,
<br>
although the accuracy leaves a lot to be desired:

<br>
<p><em>&gt; Doesn't light move at significantly different speeds in certain mediums?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If so, why choose 186,000 m/sec as the invariant speed?
</em><br>
<p>The invariant speed was not choosen by human physicists, it was set by 
<br>
physics. We can only do experiments to see what value it has.
<br>
<p>Even if there were no light the invariant speed would exist. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I think this &quot;just&quot; is very important. Could you please give the citation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for an experimental-empirical verification of E=mc2? For example, has a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuclear reactor ever published empirical reports on the reduction of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as it burns fuel?
</em><br>
<p>The most common verification is found in nuclear and particle physics, 
<br>
where the masses and velocities of atoms and particles can be measured 
<br>
before and after an interaction or decay. Binding energy can be shown to 
<br>
produce mass. 
<br>
<p>From <a href="http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/entries/equivME/#4">http://www.seop.leeds.ac.uk/entries/equivME/#4</a>  :
<br>
<p>Cockcroft and Walton (1932) are routinely credited with the first
<br>
experimental verification of mass-energy equivalence. Einstein (1905b)
<br>
had conjectured that the equivalence of mass and energy could be tested
<br>
by &quot;weighing&quot; an atom before and after it undergoes radioactive decay. 
<br>
But there was no way of performing this experiment or another experiment
<br>
that would directly confirm mass-energy equivalence at the time. 
<br>
Technological developments allowed Cockcroft and Walton to take a
<br>
different approach. They studied the bombardment of a lithium atom (Li)
<br>
by a proton (p), which produces two alpha particles (alpha). This
<br>
reaction is symbolized by the following equation:
<br>
<p>p + Li = 2alpha
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
In this reaction, there is a decrease in the total rest-mass as the 
<br>
reaction proceeds from left to right: the total rest-mass of proton and 
<br>
the Lithium atom is greater than the total rest-mass of the two alpha 
<br>
particles. Furthermore, there is also an increase in the total kinetic 
<br>
energy: the kinetic energy of the proton is less than the total kinetic 
<br>
energy of the two alpha particles. (One only considers the kinetic 
<br>
energy of the proton because the Lithium atom is considered at rest, and 
<br>
hence has zero kinetic energy.) Cockcroft and Walton were able to 
<br>
measure the kinetic energies of the incident proton and the out-going 
<br>
alpha particles very precisely. They found that the decrease in 
<br>
rest-mass corresponds to the increase in kinetic energy according to 
<br>
Einstein's famous equation E = mc2 (to an accuracy of better than 1%). 
<br>
Hence, the total mass and energy of the entire system is conserved.
<br>

<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; [Cosmological constraints: Because if photons can move at other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; velocities than the invariant velocity (if they move slowly we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; always set up a fast moving lab moving alongside to examine photons at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; rest - this is actually a good Gedankenexperiment to see why
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; electromagnetic waves have to move at the invariant speed; you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; have a stationary wave packet in vacuum) they would have a rest mass.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Don't the experiments by Alain Aspect and others show that a photon can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; move in two different directions and can be measured in two different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places at the same time? &quot;They&quot; arrive at the final, measured locations
</em><br>
<em>&gt; faster than 186,000 m/sec do they not?
</em><br>
<p>No. You are thinking of the EPR setup, where entangled photon *pairs* 
<br>
are created. 
<br>
<p>Photons can move in an indeterminate way due to quantum uncertainty, so 
<br>
that their position is undefined before it hits a detector. But after 
<br>
that point it cannot interact with another detector, regardless of 
<br>
distance. If photons did, the law of energy conservation would go out of 
<br>
the window.
