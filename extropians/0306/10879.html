<br>
<p><em>&gt; Brett raises one of our oldest and most fruitlessly debated topics:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whether an upload or a cryonics revivee is &quot;the same&quot; person he was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; before.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe the question is meaningless
</em><br>
<p>yes, especially seeing as how we really do not have any choice, as it is 
<br>
apparent (to me, anyway) that virtual immortality or radical life extension 
<br>
is not right around the corner.  So, if you want to live, go for cryonics. 
<br>
Otherwise, take your chances elsewhere.
