From: Robin Hanson [mailto:<a href="mailto:rhanson@gmu.edu?Subject=RE:%20Why%20believe%20the%20truth?%20(was:%20Rightness%20and%20Utility%20of%20Patriotism)">rhanson@gmu.edu</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt; Of course that raises the question of why believing in the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth should have such an overwhelming importance, moral or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; otherwise.
</em><br>
<p>From an evolutionary perspective I'd conjecture that creatures that
<br>
are better able to model their environment will have both survival and
<br>
reproductive advantages.
<br>
<p>This strikes me as the driving force of both &quot;intelligence&quot; and the
<br>
&quot;truth-seeking&quot; urge, which I suspect are inextricably linked.
<br>
<p>The evolutionary pressure to find &quot;truth&quot; is likely increased by
<br>
environments where other intelligent agents have the ability and
<br>
motivation to deceive (e.g., human pre-history).
<br>
<p>However, from this evolutionary perspective there is no reason that
<br>
either &quot;intelligence&quot; or &quot;truth-seeking&quot; should be an absolute
<br>
priority over other traits or activities.  
<br>
<p>Certainly it's easy enough to come up with hypothetical cases where
<br>
either believing something untrue or communicating something you
<br>
believe to be untrue is to one's advantage or is consistent with the
<br>
moral sense of most humans.
