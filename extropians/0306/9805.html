<p>Spontaneous regression of advanced cancer: Identification of a
<br>
unique genetically determined, age-dependent trait in mice
<br>
<p>&quot;We have established and studied a colony of mice with a unique
<br>
&nbsp;trait of host resistance to both ascites and solid cancers induced
<br>
by transplantable cells. One dramatic manifestation of this trait is
<br>
age-dependent spontaneous regression of advanced cancers. This
<br>
powerful resistance segregates as a single-locus dominant trait, is
<br>
independent of tumor burden, and is effective against cell lines
<br>
from multiple types of cancer. During spontaneous regression or
<br>
&nbsp;immediately after exposure, cancer cells provoke a massive
<br>
&nbsp;infiltration of host leukocytes, which form aggregates and rosettes
<br>
&nbsp;with tumor cells. The cytolytic destruction of cancer cells by innate
<br>
leukocytes is rapid and specific without apparent damage to
<br>
normal cells. The mice are healthy and cancer-free and have a
<br>
normal life span. These observations suggest a previously
<br>
unrecognized mechanism of immune surveillance, which may have
<br>
potential for therapy or prevention of cancer.&quot;
