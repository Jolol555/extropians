<em>&gt; &gt; Yes, but how many terrorist groups have massive automated

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Granted... But who *really* knows what is going on in the mountains
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of Chechnya?  We are all aware of Cheyenne Mountain. 
</em><br>
<p>Cheyenne Mountain has never had a nuke anywhere near it, nor isotope
<br>
processing technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But how many
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; elite?  I am not certain they exist as I've only heard hints about
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this but I do have some experience with how the Russians operated
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; to view the Moscow City subway one has an awareness of what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is possible -- it makes the NY City subway look like an effort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of children playing with toys.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there is a second subway in Moscow just for the elites.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I will freely grant that terrorists may currently lack the capital
</em><br>
<em>&gt; resources to do something like this currently.  But then we get
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into a question of how long that may be true?  And with tons
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of raw material floating around on the open market it is rather
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a serious question.
</em><br>
<p>We all saw the flap about aluminum tubes shipped to Iraq. Our intel
<br>
said it was precise enough to use in isotope processing. UNAEA said
<br>
otherwise. I think it is rather obvious that there is so much close
<br>
tolerance machinery and equipment needed to process isotopes for
<br>
weapons work that odds are for detection via monitoring of trade rather
<br>
than against. So long as we keep looking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree that it may take time.  But terrorists have plenty of that.
</em><br>
<p>No doubt, but there is a limit. With spybots getting smaller and
<br>
smaller, there will be a day, probably within a decade, when artificial
<br>
ants will detect and disarm rogue nukes without their owners even
<br>
suspecting.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The real threat we can't deal with is some group hacking together a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; nuke in their mountain cave redoubt.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, we generally agree here -- but hacking together a dirty bomb
</em><br>
<em>&gt; requires much less cleverness than a critical-mass nuclear bomb.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The problem they deal with is also the amount of radiation they put
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; out to the environment increasing the risk of their detection.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would generally agree, but I suspect that the shielding isn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that difficult to attain.  How many governments monitor the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purchasing of lead for example?
</em><br>
<p>Lead is monitored in mass quantities in many countries, but overt
<br>
monitoring is not important. Intel agencies know who deals in lead and
<br>
can monitor bank transactions of such enterprises. One of the good
<br>
things (and bad things) of the Patriot Act is that it makes it easier
<br>
for intel agencies to monitor trade in strategic materials more easily
<br>
without the knowledge of the traders.
<br>
<p>Lead doesn't protect against venting of radioactive dust to the
<br>
atmosphhere or water to the river systems.
<br>
<p>The only real concern with this sort of passive detection is that areas
<br>
that burn lots of coal have a significant mask of radioactive isotopes
<br>
due to those naturally present in coal being released by smoke plumes
<br>
to the environment. I'd focus more active detection methods in such areas.
