<em>&gt; Yes, humans are naturally moderately rational, and naturally use and

</em><br>
<p>This cost is not a loss as a result of rationality, it's an expenditure 
<br>
that needs to be made to get to rationality... um, review: what is it, if 
<br>
anything, that we still disagree about?  I would say that, even 
<br>
instrumentally, the benefits of rationality are higher than the losses, 
<br>
and that the costs involved do not alter this.  I am under the impression 
<br>
you still disagree with this, or that you assign it a weaker degree of 
<br>
belief?  I confess I wasn't even counting the time-energy budget as a 
<br>
loss, just taking it for granted as something a person's gotta do 
<br>
eventually.  However, even taking into account the substantial cost in 
<br>
time and mental energy, I still say it's the all-time best investment I 
<br>
ever made and I still think it's worth a shot for others too.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As an aside, I actually have high hopes that we can improve people's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incentives to be rational in their contributions to collective consensus 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; via wider use of betting markets.  People are more rational when they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bet, for obvious reasons.
</em><br>
<p>Depends on the bias.  If I recall the research correctly, most biases 
<br>
studied don't go away because of minor financial incentives.  Whether an 
<br>
entire market with major incentives can, over time, build up a discipline 
<br>
and a body of knowledge to beat bias, is a separate issue.  But, yes, I 
<br>
agree that rationality may be substantially improved.
