<p>If you're a human who has somehow been granted access to another human's 
<br>
mind by direct empathy or telepathy (how?) then it might be easier to 
<br>
&quot;feel&quot; a deliberate deception than a rationalization.  Perhaps this is 
<br>
what happens if you do a broadband computer-mediated telepathy connection 
<br>
by cross-wiring ten million neurons of prefrontal sensory integration 
<br>
cortex and seeing if the two brains learn to talk to each other; perhaps 
<br>
this is what happens if you have a perfect lie detector via training a 
<br>
neural network on fMRI data; perhaps this is what happens if you decode 
<br>
the auditory cortex and get a printout of the verbal stream of consciousness.
<br>
<p>But if you are a Friendly AI looking at an entire human mind, deliberate 
<br>
deception and rationalization should be about equally easy to detect, and 
<br>
both should be blatant in human minds or near-term derivatives thereof. 
<br>
Yes, internally some mechanisms of human rationalization flash past at 
<br>
perceptual speeds and are structurally subtle and hard to see... but from 
<br>
the perspective of an experienced connoisseur of minds-in-general looking 
<br>
at the source code, I expect human rationalization is around as subtle as 
<br>
a lead pipe to the back of the head.  Why would you expect differently? 
<br>
Evolution is not trying to hide self-deception from FAIs.
<br>
<p>I can see a loving couple wanting to execute a contract allowing for 
<br>
two-way FAI-assisted empathy, and yes, that would more easily catch lies 
<br>
than *past* rationalization.  Immediate, present-day rationalization has a 
<br>
distinct subjective feel to it, though it might be subtler for humans to 
<br>
learn detect than outright lies, and some forms of rationalization are so 
<br>
subtle that mere empathy would not be enough to catch it.  But what is the 
<br>
dreadful consequence of this?  Shallow people won't fall in love with 
<br>
empathic rationalists?  It probably would have been a doomed match anyway.
