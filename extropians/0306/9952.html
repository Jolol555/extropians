<em>&gt;        Thank you, someone should also have asked in the begining if that was 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the beginning of the discussion.  To the best of my memory neither you nor 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Harvey have ever found the beginning.  I believe Amara presented the news article 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as evidence she had found to support a discussion she and I had as much as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; month or two ago.
</em><br>
<p>Since you said you were not able to access the archives of the posts
<br>
in question, I sent you a copy in private email.  I hope you will soon
<br>
provide either evidence of what you claimed, &quot;Amara accused the US of
<br>
'carpet bombing' with cluster bombs&quot;, or an apology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;        Last, while you two young lads were leaping so quickly to that ladies 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; defense you might have noticed that she never complained about me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misrepresenting her.
</em><br>
<p>We are all harmed by misrepresentation.  It hurts the quality of the
<br>
dialog here on this list.  Harvey and I have as much right to complain
<br>
about it as anyone.  You will notice that I also complained that Harvey
<br>
was wrong to characterize your comments as dishonest.
<br>
<p>I should make clear that this thread is far from the only one where these
<br>
kinds of tactics are being used.  In fact, I see the quality of almost all
<br>
of our political discussions as being atrocious, full of name-calling and
<br>
rhetorical trickery.  Complaining about all of them would be a full time
<br>
job, which I am not willing to take on.
<br>
<p>I'm not sure what to do about it.  I've made occasional comments in an
<br>
attempt to encourage people to back off from their knee-jerk ideological
<br>
battles and try to analyze things more objectively - for example,
<br>
make a sincere attempt to make the best case you can for the side you
<br>
disagree with.  I've also talked about the nature of disagreement, facts
<br>
versus values - but most of the political threads are so mangled by the
<br>
name-calling and ideological defensiveness that it is almost impossible
<br>
to identify a single point of factual disagreement!
<br>
<p>On this list we claim to be willing to explore novel technologies.  Yet we
<br>
engage in exactly the same styles of pointless rhetorical battling that
<br>
you can find in any other forum on the net.  What is Extropian about how
<br>
we handle political disagreements?  Nothing.  We just yell at each other.
<br>
