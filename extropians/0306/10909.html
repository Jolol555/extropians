</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps its because I haven't read enough about it, but,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reservation, I have against uploading, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cryonics is that I just not convinced that, appearances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not withstanding, the me that goes in, will be the me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that comes out.
</em><br>
<p>I find it a greater leap of faith that either process will work as advertised 
<br>
any time soon.   Besides, defining &quot;person&quot; much less &quot;same person&quot; is a very 
<br>
slippery topic.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; How can X know that Xprime is any more than a very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete copy? The same process that reproduced one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Xprime from the information in X could also produced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; multiple copies.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>So the newly resurrected/revitalized/thawed/translated X-whatever probably 
<br>
would not choose to worry excessively about it?   I presume you are saying 
<br>
all the worry would be on the part of the original.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Let me try and use what seems to be an appropriate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; analogy. A candle flame, 'energy' can be transferred or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; spread from one candle (a matter substrate) to another
</em><br>
<em>&gt; without being extinguished. The flame might also be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extinguished on the original substrate and relit. Or with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology we may rebuilt a candle that, atom by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atom, is the same as the original candle and relight it,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but the *particular* flame, the *particular* energy flow
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the substrate will still have been interrupted. Indeed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it will have been snuffed out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is a poor analogy on multiple levels.  Candle flames are not unique and 
<br>
certainly not remotely as complex as humans.   There is no consciousness 
<br>
involved.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It seems to me that &quot;death&quot; may be analogous to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; candle flame (i.e. a continuous flow of energy dancing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on a matter substrate). Because we eat and exchange
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atoms throughout our lives the analogy could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extended to say wax is added to the candle whilst the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flame continues to burn. But, extinguish the flame, stop
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the continuous energy flow, and perhaps you extinguish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the continuing phenomena, the 'super-consciousness',
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (to coin a term covering conscious and unconscious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; processes) that are the subjective experience of life. I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guess what I'm positing is that, one's life, one's self,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may depends on continuity. Perhaps something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; important to the identity of a person is lost if the energy
</em><br>
<em>&gt; flow or 'super-conscious' is interrupted. Actually the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness is interrupted sometimes in life but not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; along with the unconscious so far as I know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>If it depended on continuity we would already be cooked.  
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So, does it finally come down to a &quot;leap of faith&quot; on behalf
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the potential cryonaut or the potential upload that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *they*, X, will *actually* survive?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Personally, I don't find the question very interesting.   I will be perfectly 
<br>
content if something very much like me survives the process whether you may 
<br>
agree it is &quot;me&quot; or not.  Now, I certainly wouldn't volunteer for such a 
<br>
procedure unless I had little choice or I had a high degree of certainty that 
<br>
the advantages of the upload state were so great that it was silly to 
<br>
continue in a relatively enormously limited mode and I judged the procedure 
<br>
to be quite dependable.  As an aside, I would expect the first few dozens, 
<br>
hundreds, perhaps more, uploads to be largely a disaster. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Or, and this I would like to be convinced of, are there in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fact deeper levels of understanding still available to an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inquiring mind, *this* side of the cryonics or upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt; procedure, perhaps in physics, or perhaps around
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (or avoiding) the fuzzy phenomenon I've termed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; super-conscious, that would allow one to more rationally
</em><br>
<em>&gt; avoid the sense that the prospective cryonaut or upload
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are undertaking a one way journey that is in many ways
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every bit as much a &quot;leap of faith&quot; for them as the &quot;leaps
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of faith&quot; taken by people of religious viewpoints since
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time immemorial?
</em><br>
<p><p>Hmmm.  How many things can you name that are part of life's choices that are 
<br>
not to some extent &quot;leaps of faith&quot;?    Especially, how many actual advances 
<br>
to something new and different are not in this category?
