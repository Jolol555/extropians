<p><em> &gt; Most of the hijackers were not Palestinians So what you mean to say is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that coming to the aid of your allies (in  this case  fellow muslims) is
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Wrong
</em><br>
<p>What I'm saying is that thinking 911 helped Palestinians is stupid and that
<br>
thinking the main reason Muslims hate Americans more than they love life is
<br>
because of alleged mistreatment of a people they've never seen is baloney.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; And before 911, the status quo was good?
</em><br>
<p>No, the Islamic leaders America supported were brainless thugs, the Islamic
<br>
leaders America opposed were  brainless thugs too. Islam has had nothing
<br>
but brainless thugs leading them for 800 years and some would like
<br>
to blame America for that too..
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Democracy cuts both ways, eh?  Sucks when the majority
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; Doesn't do what you want, eh?
</em><br>
<p>No, democracy doesn't cut both ways, democracy always sucks.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; And how did you manage to equate fundamentalism with wanting
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; Americans dead?
</em><br>
<p>By listening to their words, such as that great man of peace and religious
<br>
tolerance Osama bin Laden:
<br>
<p>&quot;Jihad is allowed against infidels like the Jews, Christians and atheists&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot; Our enemy, the target -- if God gives  Muslims the opportunity to do so-
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;is every American male&quot;
<br>
<p>&quot;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies--civilians and military--
<br>
&nbsp;is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in
<br>
&nbsp;which it is possible to do it&quot;
<br>
<p>And 911 proved he's not just talk too.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Sure, go ahead, pick a fight with a people
</em><br>
<p>We didn't pick a fight with anyone, we didn't ram airliners into
<br>
skyscrapers, they did, and now they would do well to remember that Islam has
<br>
not won a war with the west or even a battle in centuries.
<br>
<p><em>  &gt;Pretty much all they want you to do is stop fucking with them.
</em><br>
<p>Bullshit.
