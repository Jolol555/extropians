<p><p>Gear change for miniature machines. Wear-free cogs build themselves while
<br>
floating on liquid.US scientists have made cogs and gears that assemble
<br>
themselves, experience little wear, and perform gyrations quite beyond
<br>
conventional interlocking tooth systems. Instead of rotating on fixed
<br>
spindles, sets of the gears can continue to drive one another while
<br>
traversing freely along a meandering path. And some of the gear wheels have
<br>
no fixed teeth at all - rather, their teeth are made from liquid. In
<br>
principle, one gear of this kind could drive another turning at quite a
<br>
different speed. (Nature science Update 6/16/03)

<p>Incredibly Tough Nanotube Fibers. Spinning method turns out fibers with

silk strong enough to use for swinging from building to building and tying

<br>
match for New York's criminals had he been armed with the supertough carbon
<br>
fibers prepared recently at the University of Texas, Dallas (UTD).
<br>
Researchers there have developed a procedure for spinning composite carbon
<br>
nanotube fibers that are tougher than spider silk and any other natural or
<br>
synthetic organic fiber reported so far [Nature, 423, 703 (2003)]. The new

can be reacted chemically to make useful materials, such as plastics, have
<br>
been made by chemists at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point and UC
<br>
Davis...Robin Tanke, an assistant professor of chemistry at UWSP, worked
<br>
with UC Davis chemistry professors Susan Kauzlarich and Tim Patten to put
<br>
useful coatings on germanium nanoclusters. Kauzlarich's laboratory has

Patten's research focuses on attaching polymer coatings to different kinds
<br>
of nanoparticles. (EurekAlert 6/18/03)

<p>Imaging Lithium Atoms. One Angstrom Microscope's observations of the

first time researchers have used a transmission electron microscope -- the
<br>
One Angstrom Microscope (OÅM) at the Department of Energy's National Center
<br>
for Electron Microscopy (NCEM) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory --
<br>
to image lithium atoms. Only atoms of hydrogen and helium are smaller and

lighter than those of lithium, which under ordinary conditions is not a gas
<br>
but a soft, white metal. (Berkeley Lab 6/13/03)

this field, since I can see this type of system being used for H2 storage
<br>
once C60 becomes cheaper,&quot; comments Yves Rubin, a chemistry professor at the

<p>Molecular Switches May Not Be Switching After All. Phenylene-ethynylene
<br>
oligomers are molecules that have interested molecular electronics
<br>
researchers because they conduct electricity and appear to turn to turn
<br>
their conductivity on and off in observations with a scanning tunneling
<br>
microscope probe. Because of this, scientists have thought the molecules
<br>
could be used as molecular switches. In order for this to happen, the
<br>
molecules' intermittent conductivity had to be attributed to some internal
<br>
property of the molecules that could be controlled. Research done by
<br>
Scientists from Arizona State University and Motorola Labs suggests this
<br>
isn't the case. Physicists Ganesh K. Ramachandran, and Stuart M. Lindsay and
<br>
chemist Alex Primak from Arizona Stateand Theresa J. Hopson, Adam M. Rawlett
<br>
and Larry A. Nagahara from Motorola Labs report in the May 30 issue of
<br>
Science that the molecules' apparent &quot;switching&quot; behavior is more likely the
<br>
result of an unexpectedly weak bond with the layer of current-conducting
<br>
gold molecules on which they are arranged. When the bond is broken, the
<br>
molecules lose contact with the gold surface, and the electrical connection
<br>
is turned off. (Nanotech Planet 5/30/93)

<p>Nano expert and D.C. insider will lobby White House and public. It wasn't a
<br>
headline that the scientist liked much: &quot;Clayton Teague Thinks Small,&quot;
<br>
blared the Georgia Tech University student newspaper. That was 1968, and
<br>
Teague was a graduate student at the time. Now, he's the first full-time
<br>
director of the federal National Nanotechnology Coordination Office (NNCO),
<br>
and he's thinking even more infinitesimally. Teague has spent his career
<br>
helping the federal government explore the world at the nanoscale. The
<br>
visible contours of that world have grown during Teague's more than 30 years
<br>
of federal service, thanks in part to his work...During an interview at his
<br>
National Science Foundation office in Arlington, Va., he championed
<br>
nanotechnology as a great potential economic and social balm for the nation,
<br>
and he pledged to use his office to help knit together the many scientific
<br>
and research threads comprising nanotechnology today, from simulation and
<br>
modeling to biotechnology to materials science. (SmallTimes 6/20/03)

<p>Nanotech breakthrough jogs memory. The first 10GB nanotechnology memory

Massachusetts company has said. Using carbon nanotubes a billionth of a

meter in diameter sprinkled onto a silicon wafer, the device has been made
<br>
using mostly standard chip production techniques. The company claims that

the technology can combine the speed and price of dynamic memory with the

non-volatility of flash, making it a strong candidate for the eagerly

awaited universal memory devices that the industry hopes will replace all

other types. (ZDnet 6/13/03) <a href="http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1103_2-1016942.html">http://zdnet.com.com/2100-1103_2-1016942.html</a>

<p>(Book) Is the end nigh? Sir Martin Rees, Britain's most distinguished
<br>
theoretical astrophysicist and one of its best writers on matters
<br>
cosmological, is no stranger to catastrophe; he has a professional interest
<br>
in supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, cannibal galaxies and many of the
<br>
universe's other savageries. In Our Final Century, though, his concern is
<br>
not just destruction, but self-destruction. The 20th century, he points out,
<br>
was the first in which humanity's chance of self-destruction shot up above
<br>
the eschatological background noise...But the heart of his argument is the
<br>
risk of intentional destruction. Like Bill Joy, chief scientist of Sun
<br>
Microsystems, who wrote an influential article on the matter in Wired a few
<br>
years ago, Rees fears that biotechnology and nanotechnology will provide
<br>
greater potential for destruction, and permit ever smaller groups - or
<br>
indeed individuals - to make use of them. (The Guardian 6/14/03)

<p>Quantum Dot Advances. Studies show that nanoparticles have potential

biological applications.
<br>
The semiconductor nanoparticles known as quantum dots have moved closer to
<br>
biological applications, according to two recent reports. In one paper,
<br>
scientists at Cornell University, collaborating with Quantum Dot Corp. in
<br>
Hayward, Calif., use quantum dots as a label for multiphoton imaging in live
<br>
animals. In the other report, Japanese researchers use chaperone proteins to
<br>
encapsulate and protect quantum dots, preventing them from aggregating and
<br>
losing their size-dependent properties. (C&amp;E 6/19/03)

<p>Nanotechnology: the next small thing. Investors are piling into a

revolutionary new sector, but skeptics say it's just another bubble in the

making. Richard Fletcher and Lauren Mills report. It's the stuff of science

fiction: nanotechnology, a scientific breakthrough which its proponents
<br>
claim will create computers the size of a grain of sand and miniature robots
<br>
that will march through the body repairing damaged organs. Nanotechnology is
<br>
no Hollywood fiction. According to a report to be published this week by Lux
<br>
Capital, the US venture capital firm, worldwide governments and venture
<br>
capitalists invested more than $3bn in the fledgling sector in 2002. And the

investors hope to grab a fat slice of a market which the US government

confidently claims will be worth $1 trillion by 2012. (Telegraph.co.uk

<p>Tetrapod nanocrystals could improve solar cells. A new shape for
<br>
semiconductor nanocrystals-tetrapods, rather than simple spheres, rods and
<br>
disks-could double the efficiency of &quot;plastic&quot; solar cells, according to the
<br>
inventor of tetrapods. Paul Alivisatos, the inventor of semiconductor
<br>
tetrapods and a professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said
<br>
they promise to convert twice as much incident light into electricity.
<br>
Tetrapods also promise to improve chemical sensors, biomedicine and

plastic composites. (EETimes 6/9/03)

the resulting causes of heat dissipation in low-dimensional nanoscale

electronics could lead to cool-running single-electron &quot;quantum dot&quot;
<br>
transistors, according to a researcher here at the University of

Wisconsin-Madison. Better understanding of heat dissipation in semiconductor
<br>
materials should enable chip makers to cool down even massive
<br>
heat-generating chips like central processing units (CPUs). &quot;So much heat is
<br>
being dissipated by CPUs today that may people's laptops get uncomfortably

warm. Our technique for studying low-dimensional electron systems should

help future chips avoid generating so much heat,&quot; said Robert Blick,

<p>Rage Against the (Green) Machine. First came the concerns about nuclear
<br>
power. Then, the fears about genetically modified foods. Now, European and C
<br>
anadian environmentalists have a new, lab-made monstrosity to rail against:
<br>
nanotechnology. Last week, at the Brussels headquarters of the European
<br>
Parliament, Greenpeace, GeneWatch U.K., the ETC Group and others held a
<br>
teach-in, of sorts. The goal was to highlight the potential dangers that
<br>
could arise when scientists start manipulating matter at the nano --
<br>
billionth of a meter -- level. Nano-sized bits are so small that they can
<br>
penetrate your skin, get into your lungs, and travel through your body
<br>
unmolested by the immune system, argues ETC program manager Jim Thomas.
<br>
Research, he claims, shows that matter gets more toxic when it's shrunk to
<br>
the super-small -- no matter what the material is. -What?-  (Wired 6/19/03)

<p>'Nano' Suddenly a Gigantic Label. Nanotechnology has become one of the
<br>
hottest areas in scientific research, pulling in billions of dollars in
<br>
government, corporate and foundation cash. But the scientist who coined the
<br>
term &quot;nanotechnology&quot; says a lot of what passes for nano is just plain ol'
<br>
science, gussied up with a fancy name to rake in the bucks.
<br>
&quot;'Nanotechnology'&quot; has now become little more than a marketing term,&quot; said

Eric Drexler, founder of the Foresight Institute, the leading nanotech think

tank. &quot;Work that scientists have been doing for decades is now being
