&lt;&lt;Exactly the same thing was done to the Nazi organization

after WWII, and ought always to be done.  Because if it is
<br>
not done, a ruthless minority of fanatics will once again
<br>
assume power, and the atrocities will go on and on and on.
<br>
It's how history works, unfortunately.

</em><br>
<p>OF course you are correct.  The Nazis were hunted down
<br>
ruthlessly.  The whole organization in Germany was weeded
<br>
out; allied intelligence spent much of 1945 and 1946 doing
<br>
it.  The Nazis who were not arrested were watched very
<br>
carefully, and none of them was allowed to play any role
<br>
whatsoever in new organizations.
<br>
<p>THis is what has to happen to the Baath party, and is
<br>
being done.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Gawrsh! as Goofy would pronounce it, sometimes things

</em><br>
<p>Yep, but not by accident.
<br>
<p>But I am confused---was there anything in what I wrote that
<br>
you are disagreeing with?  I couldn't tell.
