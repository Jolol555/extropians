<em>&gt;&gt;I agree our actual choices tend to be piecemeal, but unfortunately this

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Why?  It looks to me like the costs are lowered, because you acquire both

<em>&gt;costs and benefits incrementally, rather than acquiring all the costs at 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;significant challenges arising from the debiasing of self-deception.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ...  Most people pay sincere lip service to rationality, ...  But .. we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; each usually manage to avoid believing that a particular bias applies to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us in a particular situation.  ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;According to your theory, wouldn't this *reduce* the cost of adhering to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;rationality during the early stages?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, humans are naturally moderately rational, and naturally use and 
<br>
improve that rationality as long as doing so does not threaten our 
<br>
cherished self-deceptions.  The extra cost I had in mind was having to deal 
<br>
with an &quot;enemy&quot; (our subconscious) that knows us very well and has had long 
<br>
evolution-embodied experience in fooling us into thinking we have made 
<br>
progress when we have not.  My estimate that this cost is very high is in 
<br>
part based on the very small fraction of people that seem to incur this 
<br>
cost and successfully overcome their biases.
<br>
<p>As an aside, I actually have high hopes that we can improve people's 
<br>
incentives to be rational in their contributions to collective consensus 
<br>
via wider use of betting markets.  People are more rational when they bet, 
<br>
for obvious reasons.
