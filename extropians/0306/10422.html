<p>
Thanks for the responses and comments, both on list and off.  The variety 
<br>
of responses and reactions tells me that list members are more concerned 
<br>
about being barred on a topic, or that a topic is out of bounds on the list 
<br>
than how ExI or extropians is represented in a mailing list that welcomes 
<br>
the public and is very easy to join.
<br>
<p>First, the topic is not banned nor will it be.  We don't function that way, 
<br>
never have and never will.  So, erase that from your minds.  What I thought 
<br>
might be advantageous for posters who want to discuss, argue, blame, point 
<br>
a finger, agree, enjoy, exchange posts would be a sub-list for that 
<br>
purpose.  This is basic business practice.  Supply and demand.
<br>
<p>Looking at the situation from a different perspective:
<br>
<p>Harvey writes about his concerns by the viewing public and how this affects 
<br>
list members and ExI.  Several people discuss this with me privately, and 
<br>
have mentioned it on the list publicly.
<br>
<p>My conclusion is that probably most list members are more concerned about 
<br>
their freedom to say and do as they please than being conscientious about 
<br>
how list members and ExI are represented or viewed.  It shouldn't be one or 
<br>
the other.
<br>
<p>This saddens me because in the larger picture, ExI does need to be 
<br>
represented in the world as a substantial organization that has provided a 
<br>
platform for people to exchange ideas about the future.
<br>
<p>What I would like to know is how many list members are members of 
<br>
ExI.  Perhaps this will be very revealing, maybe not, but I think it would 
<br>
be helpful for us to know.  What do you think?
<br>
<p>Natasha
