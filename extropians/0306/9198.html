Lee ululated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;&quot;Resistance is futile,&quot; we would cry,
<br>
&quot;no one can resist the Brothers Keepers!  Rejoice!&quot;.  But very soon the
<br>
terror in his eyes would be replaced by extreme ecstasy as the effect of the
<br>
drugs set in.  At this point he'd &quot;get it&quot;.  It would be excessively obvious
<br>
to him that all his unhappiness had merely been due to the dominance of
<br>
unfortunate chemicals in his brain, which now the sublime saints of the
<br>
Brothers Keepers had overcome with chemicals of their own.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Shit, man. Couldn't you have at least made it the Sisters Keepers, and made 
<br>
it babes naked under those monks robes? Rats!
