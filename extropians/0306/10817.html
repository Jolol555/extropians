<em>&gt; ...okay, I'm spacing here.  There's a standard retort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the fear that genetic enhancement will lead to a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single genotype becoming dominant - much moreso, by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; much higher percentage (at least of those with access
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to this) having more 9s in their 99.999...% similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; DNA, than is presently the norm - with the remaining
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holdouts becoming discriminated against for that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason alone.  But I forget what that retort is just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; now.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not aware of a standard retort here.  If there is one I'd like to
<br>
hear it.
<br>
<p>My own view is that parents have a biological urge to have a child
<br>
that is genetically *theirs*, just with some added benefits.  Most
<br>
dark haired parents are not going to want a blonde child.  Most
<br>
passionately emotional parents are not going to want a reserved child.
<br>
<p><p>Undoubtedly there will be certain genes where almost anyone who
<br>
tinkers with them will choose the same allele. For example, one allele
<br>
of the APoE gene confers a lower risk of both heart disease and
<br>
Alzheimer's.  But for the genes that control behavior, things will not
<br>
be so clear cut.  Almost any behavior affecting gene is going to have
<br>
multiple effects and trade-offs.  That will force parents to choose
<br>
based on their own preferences, and those choices will guarantee
<br>
diversity.
