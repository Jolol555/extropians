<em>&gt; &gt; I'm no encryption expert but since reading Simon Singh's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; The Code Book back in 1999 I've had the impression that

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; codes even given quantum computers. I'm not sure what
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;  the state of the art is - the following article seems to gives
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; some hints.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As Eugen Leitl likes to quip, it's math versus physics and he prefers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to trust the math.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nowadays, transmissions are routinely secured by encryption which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is mathematical.  To send a message, you send a bunch of data.  It
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can pass through many different networks, over different media,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  As long as the data eventually arrives, encryption is applicable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's quite possible that practical quantum computers (which we don't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have and won't have in the immediate future) might greatly reduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the effort required to break current encryption schemes.
</em><br>
<p>Ah but his is where I wonder if we can be so sure.
<br>
<p>In Simon Singh's book he makes the point (I think) that govt boffins
<br>
get access to all the commercially published stuff  and can springboard
<br>
of that. Some of the advances in cryptography and in computing
<br>
hardware were actually further ahead than was genuinely known.
<br>
<p>Now I'm no big enthusiast for conspiracy theories but I have been
<br>
doing some casual recsearch (not much yet) into the nefarious 
<br>
area of  &quot;Secret Patents&quot;. The whole idea of a patent, is that its
<br>
supposed to represent a good public policy tradeoff whereby the
<br>
inventor gets a timelimited monopoly to exploit his inventions and
<br>
in exchange he/she is supposed to provide a detailed description
<br>
of the best use of the innovation for publioc perusal. 
<br>
<p>But with this Secret Patent idea, based on a convo I had with a
<br>
patent office guy in Australia, the would be patenter subs their
<br>
application and if anything weaponish grabs the attention of the
<br>
examiner, the examiner is obliged to shoot it off to the the defence
<br>
department for the once over. 
<br>
<p>It occurs to me, please bear in mind I have only started looking
<br>
into this, that almost all the technologies transhumanist types
<br>
are likely to have an interest in could be seen as having some 
<br>
sort of military application. Nano, AI, cryto, aspects of biotech.
<br>
It would be kinda nice to know that IP is not being stockpiled
<br>
for someone else with more martial inclinations.
<br>
<p>But how can we know. Now I reckon that it would be pretty
<br>
hard to develop certain types of technology without some sort
<br>
of hints being given off that curious bods of the type that frequnet
<br>
lists like this would entirely overlook. For instance I seriously
<br>
doubt the three letter agencies have teleportation devices. But 
<br>
I would not be quite so sure, lacking the physics myself, to 
<br>
dismiss quantum computing. I'd have to do quite a bit of
<br>
reading to guess at where they could be at. 
<br>
<p>I do know that a friend of a friend (the best sources) who 
<br>
was/is working with quantum computing in Canberra has had
<br>
the NSA wander around the facility asking questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; doesn't necessarily mean that it will be trivial or even practical.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anyway, people don't worry much about this, because it stands to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reason that by the time practical quantum computers are available,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there will also be new encryption schemes that take advantage of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the properties of quantum computing and will be just as unbreakable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with quantum computers as current schemes are with current hardware.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe not. Depends who develops quantum computers first. 
<br>
When they cracked the enigma code quite a bit of trouble was taken
<br>
not to give up the intel that they had cracked it. 
<br>
<p>&lt;snipped remainder&gt;
<br>
<p>Thanks for the heads up.
