</em><br>
<p>First off, it's not exactly &quot;my&quot; argument; Plantinga thought it up on the
<br>
basis of Anselm's &quot;argument&quot; (which is so bad that there's a large body of
<br>
literature of people just trying to figure out what it says).
<br>
<p>Secondly, it's all good and well to criticize the definition of &quot;God&quot; used
<br>
in Plantiga's argument.  Like I say, I encourage you not to remove the
<br>
scare quotes from Plantinga's &quot;God&quot;.  This is an extremely tricky
<br>
definition, not to be swallowed whole, or, perhaps, at all.
<br>
<p>With that said, I think your response is best put as saying: &quot;You have
<br>
misidentified the definition of 'god.' Getting to be a 'god' is as easy as
<br>
launching a rich SimX universe.&quot;  But that's a far cry from showing the
<br>
argument to be invalid.
<br>
<p>To see this, let's not trust that Plantinga's definition of &quot;God&quot; is true
<br>
of whatever (if anything) we, in ordinary conversation, call God; let's
<br>
say that we define X to be the entity, if there is any, with maximal
<br>
greatness.  Such as it is, it's therefore &quot;necessary,&quot; existing in all
<br>
possible worlds, or in none.
<br>
<p>Hence, if you think there's a possible world in which there's X, you
<br>
should think that X is in our actual world as well.  If you think there's
<br>
a possible world in which there's no X, you should think that X isn't in
<br>
any possible worlds, say nothing of our own.  If you think that there's a
<br>
possible world in which there's X and another possible world in which
<br>
there's no X, you believe a contradiction.
<br>
<p>The argument is VALID, but it remains to be seen whether it shows anything
<br>
interesting, about, say, &quot;gods&quot; in the ordinary sense.  Certainly, if
<br>
there were an X, I'd be comfortable calling X a God, but maybe there are
<br>
other things that I'd call a God which aren't X... you list some good
<br>
candidates.  With that said, even if I would agree with you that rulers
<br>
over rich simulated universes are gods, I would STILL think that either X
<br>
is in all possible worlds or there are no Xs at all.
