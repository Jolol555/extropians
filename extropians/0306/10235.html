<em>&gt; &gt; I'll let Mitch answer, but we're all in trouble if the likes

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Thanks!  But it's not just me.  Amara, Damien, Eliezer, Emlyn, Hubert,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; James, Jeff, Mez, Olga, Samantha and I have all been recently accused of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; somehow supporting the enemy.  These baseless personal attacks seem to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be a widespread problem.
</em><br>
<p>Aha!  The usual ilk!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; People on this list have been accused of being communists,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; anti-American, traitors, terrorists, enemy combatants, etc.,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; simply because they don't agree with some aggressive posters.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; These are serious charges, some of which carry the death penalty.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Well, we should inspect the tiny kernel of truth in such charges,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; if any such truth there be.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I disagree.  There is no tiny kernel of truth.  None of these people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever given any indication of supporting the enemy.
</em><br>
<p>Well, of course by &quot;the enemy&quot; you mean Saddam Hussein.  I'm
<br>
sorry that I haven't followed the list so closely recently
<br>
that I have a good feeling for how excessive the accusations
<br>
have been.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The attacks are baseless slander.  They are based on these people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not jumping on the bandwagon to support the war and the president.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Any liberal, democratic or peaceful position is being lumped in as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being anti-American.  This is incorrect.
</em><br>
<p>But doesn't it all depend on how you conceive of what your
<br>
proper duties are as a citizen?  Is it not also highly parameterized
<br>
by circumstances?  I'm sure that you can think of many historical
<br>
situations (or simulations) in which sufficient danger would exist,
<br>
or in which sufficient fealty would be the norm, that it would be
<br>
true that &quot;if you are not with us, then you are against us&quot;?
<br>
<p>I readily understand that you cannot take insults lying down,
<br>
and that you need to defend what &quot;anti-American&quot; would mean to
<br>
you (not that you and others have neglected this).  I myself
<br>
doubt the utility or the wisdom of such provocations---yet if
<br>
you could (and I don't know---perhaps you've tried) get those
<br>
people to explain more concretely what they mean when they use
<br>
such terms, perhaps the disagreements would be loftier.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; These are our friends being accused of war crimes.  This is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; excessive.  What is going on here?
</em><br>
<p>What is going on is differing conceptions of what a country
<br>
or a nation should be, and the proper amount of allegiance
<br>
that is due.  ;-) Your cries of &quot;slander&quot; are just as much an
<br>
overreaction as theirs of &quot;war-criminal&quot;, or &quot;traitor&quot;, though
<br>
perhaps they did start it.  Sorry to keep beating on my theme
<br>
here, but it's the underlying assumptions that need to be 
<br>
argued about, not the surface phenomena.
<br>
<p>Lee
