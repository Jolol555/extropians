</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Given that renewable energy sources are HIGHLY dependent on

<em>&gt; &gt; construction with very low interest capital, its obvious that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; fossil
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fuel generators will thereafter be at a competetive disadvantage to

<em>&gt; &gt; those finished before interest goes back up.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I not sure I follow your reasoning here Mike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Fossil fuel generation plants already exist, indeed, so now do some 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; new windmills, so once these alternate forms of generation are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to distribute electricity to the grid their relevant costs to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; supply
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would seem to depend more now on the operational costs rather than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the construction costs.
</em><br>
<p>Fossil fuel plants, whose operating costs are primarily labor and fuel
<br>
(mostly fuel), are at a disadvantage when interest rates go back up
<br>
because such plants, if they do not own their own already established
<br>
fuel supply chain, generally must make large seasonal or annual
<br>
purchase agreements to get fuel at economically competetive rates. Such
<br>
purchases incur financing, ergo finance charges at higher interest
<br>
rates increase the net cost of fuel and result in less competetive
<br>
energy. When such situations become tight, generators will generally
<br>
switch from a full time generation situation to one of generating only
<br>
or mostly for peak consumption periods, when they can charge the
<br>
highest rates for their power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As you say, a new player (with their windmills not yet built)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entering the electrical supply market when interest rates on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; construction capital are higher would find the cost of entry higher.
</em><br>
<p>This is right, and not what I said. What I said was that windmills
<br>
built and installed when interest rates are low find they are
<br>
competetive if not outcompeting fossil fuel generators when interest
<br>
rates go back up, specifically because of the fuel finance situation I
<br>
detailed above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just as an afterthought, I understood that it is the nature of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; electricity that it needs to be generated at the same time as it is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used. ie . They are no super large batteries akin to water reservoirs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; etc.  So windmills would only be able to provide power to the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grids when the wind blows. And the net demand for electricity will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; depend on when most of it is being used.
</em><br>
<p>Actually, there are a few locations where hydroelectric 'batteries'
<br>
have been built to take advantage of peak and off-peak demand changes,
<br>
which adds value to off-peak generated power.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I did some contract work for a hydro electricity plant years ago
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and they had to balance to timing of the release of water to turn
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the turbines with when there was a need for power and when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the water could also be used as a downstream resource for 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrigation or river maintenance etc.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and this is also a problem with intermittent energy providers like
<br>
wind, solar, tides, etc where the power plant operator has little or no
<br>
control over when they are able to generate or not. Hydro at least has
<br>
some degree of control (excluding drought and fish migration conditions).
