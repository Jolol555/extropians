<em>&gt; MEZ,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;        Then laugh all you want if you are amused but tell me 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; why you are pushing the Arab party line instead of admitting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the truth.  Your people hate us because of who and what we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are.  
</em><br>
<p>Ron, they're not &quot;my people&quot;.  They're just people.  
<br>
<p>I'm not pushing any Arab party line.  I'm just telling you that in my
<br>
opinion every single person I know living in the middle east (200
<br>
maybe?) would gladly immigrate to the US.  They're not dumb.  They
<br>
know we have a better government, better schools, more freedom, higher
<br>
standard of living, more opportunity for their kids, etc...  And they
<br>
want those things for themselves.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Instead you want to make it sound as if we have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deeply offended you on some deep level and that the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence we have found is non existent.
</em><br>
<p>What evidence?  
<br>
<p>My contention is that people are people.  The vast majority of people
<br>
on this planet want safety, freedom, affluence, a better life for
<br>
their children, etc...  Specifically, that is what the vast majority
<br>
of people living in the middle east want.  And of course, many people
<br>
in any culture who live in poverty and see others living in wealth
<br>
feel jealousy and resentment.  That's a strong feeling in the middle
<br>
east - not because arabs hate democracy and capitalism, but because
<br>
arabs want affluence and opportunity, the things which only come with
<br>
democracy and capitalism.
<br>
<p>My contention is supported by vast anthropological data on the
<br>
commonality of human behavior across thousands of cultures around the
<br>
world.  See for example Pinker's new book, _The Blank Slate_.
<br>
<p>My contention is further supported by the following:
<br>
<p>1) Across the Arab world, roughly 100 times as many people apply to
<br>
immigrate to the US each year than are accepted.   In Egypt alone,
<br>
about 150,000 people sought to immigrate to the US in 2002.  Let me
<br>
put that another way: about 1 in every 300 people in Egypt applied to
<br>
immigrate to the US in just this past year.  Is that the sign of
<br>
people who hate the American way of life?
<br>
<p>2) American culture is wildly successful in the middle east.  The top
<br>
movies and TV shows are dubbed or subtitled versions of US hits.
<br>
American and British music is big there.  The local media have
<br>
themselves become progressively more westernized over the past few
<br>
years.  
<br>
<p>3) As an example of the above, consider Al Jazeera.  Al Jazeera is a
<br>
new phenomenon in the middle east.  It came out of nowhere to become
<br>
the most widely viewed news station in the world.  Why?  Well, it
<br>
takes a western journalistic attitude towards the news, being willing
<br>
to say things that state-sponsored TV won't.  And it comes across as
<br>
modern and high tech.  It has flashy graphics like CNN.  It has female
<br>
anchors and reporters.  Male and female anchors alike dress in western
<br>
clothes.  Compare this to the older and less successful state
<br>
stations.  They look old-fashioned.  They just mouth the party line.
<br>
The anchors dress in traditional middle eastern garb.  
<br>
<p>Seems to me like western memes are winning.
<br>
<p>4) Finally, my personal experiences with scores of people currently
<br>
living in the middle east and scores more who have immigrated from
<br>
there is that, virtually without fail, people in the middle east want
<br>
the trappings of American life.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;        Heck after more than fifty years your people can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even tell the truth about Israel nor admit they have a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; right to live except at your mercy. 
</em><br>
<p>Now you're just flame baiting.
<br>
<p>But enough.  I get very little value from your posts, so I don't think
<br>
I'll be reading or responding to them from here on out.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
