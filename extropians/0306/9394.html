<p>OK, let's de-rant here. Let's scratch that label, since it bugs you so.
<br>
<p>Consider this the cultural analog to the hunber-gatherer diet thread.
<br>
<p>I'm asking (and I can't be the first to ask) if increased stimulation 
<br>
correlates with decreased attention span, increased inability to focus, 
<br>
etc., when measured against (say) the cadre of people who came of age in 
<br>
1903, and whether that's something without extremely high evolutionary 
<br>
pressure to handle gracefully as a species, and that *some* significant 
<br>
number of young people are experiencing and srviving levels and kinds of 
<br>
distress they wouldn't have in 1903, and have developed in such a way that 
<br>
they can't resolve the kinds of problems their hypothetical doppelgangers 
<br>
in 1903 could have handled because the stimuli and pace of life was less 
<br>
hectic. Yes, some of that *is* not having approved outlets for boy 
<br>
behavior. But *all*?
<br>
<p>Developmental neuroplasticity makes it at least a legitimate question, I 
<br>
think--though how to measure it is very very hard. We don't have a way of 
<br>
subjecting a representative sample of kids in 1903 to any real observations 
<br>
today; then there's diet differences, too.
<br>
<p>And then there's the whole &quot;adapting to an insane society is that society's 
<br>
definition of sanity&quot; conundrum to deal with. So it's intractible in 
<br>
practice.
<br>
<p>Just handwaving and saying &quot;boys will be boys&quot; doesn't address these (&quot;are 
<br>
some of us in overload?&quot;) matters, however true the saying might be. 
<br>
Personal narratives, likewise. I hope you understand I'm not asking this as 
<br>
a Luddite.
<br>
<p>There are *lots* of things wrong with the way most kids are handled today. 
<br>
Warehousing of any kind sucks, 10-4.
<br>
<p>MMB
