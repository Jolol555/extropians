<em>&gt; &gt; Certainly, I can understand why a 13-year-old would think that (most
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; teenagers are prone to narcissism, anyway - it's probably even an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; important developmental step).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also remember that this boy is still in the formative stages gathering
</em><br>
<em>&gt; input.  He just finished his degree.  He has been learning everything
</em><br>
given
<br>
<em>&gt; to him.  I have no doubt that he excelled in his learning of the Bible and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; church studies as well.  He has not yet gotten to the stage where he is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; questioning what he has learned or started producing new ideas to replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the old ideas yet.  That comes with experience.
</em><br>
<p>You're right.
<br>
<p>Even as I initially brought up Greg Smith, I was thinking of the whole issue
<br>
of who gets to bat the ball - who gets the TV coverage, book deals, Larry
<br>
King Show, etc.  No uppity people need apply.  No boat rockers.
<br>
<p>And, talk protective coloration.  In Taylor Branch's first biography of
<br>
Martin Luther King - Branch wrote of how there had been many qualified
<br>
candidates for black leadership positions, but that it was important for the
<br>
&quot;Negro leader&quot; role to be filled by a person perceived to be a &quot;man of god.&quot;
<br>
In essence, the United States needed *a* Martin Luther King, Jr.  On the
<br>
world's stage, it was embarrassing that the United States practiced
<br>
segregation, and the Bible Belt wasn't going to give up its old wicked
<br>
habits without a fight.  So, a *religious* (read:  &quot;safe&quot;) leader was
<br>
essentially given the helm to aid the *U.S.* out of this embarrassing
<br>
situation (of being an alleged democracy where democracy was not truly
<br>
practiced).  MLK didn't just aid black people - he saved the US from being a
<br>
laughingstock.
<br>
<p>It was all rather orchestrated ... even the incident with Rosa Parks.
<br>
Although the incident was the real deal, there had been other incidents like
<br>
that over the years, but Rosa Parks was &quot;chosen&quot; as a good representative
<br>
martyr/victim.  She was &quot;sympathetic&quot; (read:  &quot;safe&quot;).
