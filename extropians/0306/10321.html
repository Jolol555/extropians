<em>&gt;&gt;Of course that raises the question of why believing in the truth should
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;plausibly argue that it is more moral to be loyal to one's group, even
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;if this means that your beliefs will be biased, just as they believe it
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;is more moral to give charity to members of your group, even if this
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;means that worse off outsiders go without. I have to admit to while I
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;think that there are few things more important than believing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;truth, I can offer only disappointingly weak moral arguments to justify
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Here are some of my favorite answers:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;     * &quot;Because I value the truth as a thing in itself.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>That's a statement of the position, not an argument for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     * &quot;If the sky is blue, it's blue.  If I think that's true, how could 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I believe something else just because I wanted to?  That's not how my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mind is wired.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Then your brain is different from most humans.  As with patriotism, humans 
<br>
are in fact wired to be biased in many ways, and we have to work to 
<br>
overcome those biases.  Of course we don't believe we are biased, but that 
<br>
doesn't stop us from being biased to believe things we want to 
<br>
believe.  Honestly, I think it must be the same with you; you'd like to 
<br>
believe you are different, but you are not.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     * &quot;Because knowing the truth is the best and only means of achieving 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the goals I care about.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>To judge whether this is true, we need to know more about the goals you 
<br>
care about.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     * &quot;Because even the process whereby I *decide* my goals depends on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; finding the actual answers (as opposed to the comforting or convenient 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answers) to logical or factual questions.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>People *can* choose comforting or convenient goals.  For example, a common 
<br>
argument against moral consequentialism is that it is too much work to 
<br>
figure out the consequences of your actions for all people over all time.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     * &quot;Because if I wrapped myself up in a private world, severing my 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection to outside reality, I would destroy my potential to grow as a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; person.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>There are clearly lots of ways to grow that do not depend on close times to 
<br>
outside reality.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     * &quot;Darn, I don't have enough knowledge to answer that question.  I'd 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; better go get some.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Most people answer such questions without much of any knowledge.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;     * &quot;Because without accurate knowledge, I'd have no way of knowing how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dangerous it was to be ignorant.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Most of us make most of the important decisions in our lives without 
<br>
accurate knowledge of their dangers.
<br>
<p>An instrumental justification of seeking truth seems bound to run into 
<br>
situations where it harms other goals more than it helps.  For example, if 
<br>
you want a happy marriage you might do better to not know too much about 
<br>
how unhappy most marriages end up, or how similarly happy you might have 
<br>
been with the other spouses you could have chosen.  Probably simpler to 
<br>
just declare truth-seeking as a strong primary goal.
