What would be neat would be if we could find some natty way of getting
<br>
nanoparticles containing cytotoxins directed in on monoclonal quantum dot
<br>
labelled tumor sites. It would give us a nice way of doing cell specific
<br>
chemotherapy with less side effects.

&gt;
&gt; HOLEY FULLERENE OPENS WIDE FOR H2
&gt; Open-cage derivative is first to provide H2-encapsulated complex in 100%
yield
&gt; RON DAGANI
&gt;
&gt; Japanese chemists for the first time have prepared an open-cage fullerene
derivative with an orifice large enough to allow a hydrogen molecule to be
inserted into the cage in 100% yield [J. Am. Chem. Soc., 125, 7152 (2003)].
&gt;
&gt; &quot;I think it is an important advance for this field, since I can see this
type of system being used for H2 storage once C60 becomes cheaper,&quot; comments
Yves Rubin, a chemistry professor at the University of California, Los
Angeles.
&gt;
&gt; Scientists are looking for efficient methods for stuffing fullerene cages
with metal atoms or gases to make new types of functional materials.
&gt;
&gt; Two years ago, Rubin and his collaborators at UCLA and Yale University
reported the synthesis of a fullerene derivative featuring a &quot;mouth&quot; large
enough to accept and trap a H2 molecule in 5% yield (C&amp;EN, April 23, 2001,
page 11). Although the yield has since been improved to 10%, this system
still cannot compete with the new Japanese molecule, which Rubin says is
better because it has a slightly larger orifice.
&gt;
&gt; The new molecule was prepared from C60 in three steps in 40% overall yield
by chemistry professor Koichi Komatsu and coworkers Yasujiro Murata and
Michihisa Murata at Kyoto University. When they expose the compound to
hydrogen gas at 800 atm and 200 °C in an autoclave, 100% encapsulation is
achieved within eight hours, they report.
&gt;
&gt; None of the encapsulated hydrogen escaped when a solution of the
endohedral complex was monitored for more than three months at room
temperature. However, hydrogen was released slowly when the solution was
heated above 160 °C, Komatsu says.
&gt;
&gt; During mass spectral studies, the Kyoto group discovered that laser
irradiation can cause the endohedral complex to regenerate pristine
buckminsterfullerene with H2 inside--that is, H2@C60--in the gas phase. This
suggests that endohedral fullerene complexes might one day be prepared
entirely by organic synthesis, Komatsu tells C&amp;EN. In fact, his group is now
aiming to close the orifice chemically to achieve a chemical synthesis of
H2@C60.
