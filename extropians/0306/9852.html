<p>Relative to their economy, that's a lot of money. And if it means cheaper

<p>Not *all* the work is going off-shore, however. Just some of it, which suits

that model (and maybe some more, which doesn't, but that must be a passing

<p>It's not like this has happened overnight, and it hasn't just fallen on them

going in their country.

<p>Assuming that you can set up world class technical universities in third
<br>
world rubbish dumps, you may be correct.
<br>
<p>It's surprised me how the normally very free-market oriented tech workers
<br>
have become raving protectionists as this storm of cheap overseas
<br>
competitors, gathering for maybe 10 years now, has finally broken. Well,
<br>
hello real world.
