<br>
Yet we engage in exactly the same styles of pointless rhetorical battling that 
<br>
you can find in any other forum on the net.  What is Extropian about how we 
<br>
handle political disagreements?  Nothing.  We just yell at each other.
<br>
<p>Hal,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the risk of bringing down the wrath of the entire list on my head 
<br>
please let me respond to that. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We seem to get so oriented toward the hard sciences that we forget 
<br>
there is a whole world of philosophy, political science, theology and goodness 
<br>
knows what else out in the real world that is derived and discussed in a 
<br>
rational and reason based way.  Science can lay claim to much but not to being the 
<br>
only reason based field is not a claim science can sustain.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We fall for every con artist that comes along with three shells and a 
<br>
pea once we get outside the field of hard science.  We truly need a broader e
<br>
ducation for our scientists -- a scientist has to fill many roles besides 
<br>
scientist.
<br>

<br>
<p>BTW, this symbolically describes how I got out of hard engineering.  I was an 
<br>
airplane driver that had turned Mechanical Engineering student.  In the 
<br>
university (Washington University in St. Louis, Mo.) my best friend was a masters 
<br>
student in physics.  I lived in a nice logical universe.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One day I took an elective in mathematical statistics and really loved 
<br>
that.  I was immediately afterwards thrown in with some of the softer fields. 
<br>
&nbsp;For a little while I suffered from brain stretching as my mind got expanded.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually I pursued an MBA at the University of Chicago.  I was sick 
<br>
of seeing engineers, chemists, &amp; phycists in manufacturing companies stuck in 
<br>
a corner while people with half their intelligence made the important 
<br>
decisions.  (Oh, I forgot the occasional biologist) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just one example, I have seen a man with a masters in microbiology out 
<br>
in a boxcar load of peanuts in the Chicago winter using a &quot;black light&quot; to 
<br>
detect rat droppings &amp; urine while a semi literate ran the factory with threats 
<br>
of physical violence.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I identify with the intelligence of the scientists and the engineers.  
<br>
But I will never agree to see us keep ourselves so narrowly based that we 
<br>
take orders from the goons.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we do that you can kiss your extropic world goodbye because it will 
<br>
be a goon world and will meet goon goals.
<br>
