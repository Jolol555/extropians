<p><em>&gt; Nobody I know would build a world just like reality is today.  I think

</em><br>
<p>The use of indexicals here such as &quot;this world&quot; and &quot;our levels&quot; is
<br>
misleading.  If this world is a simulation, then this world may be
<br>
considerably more exciting than its previous version.  I don't feel like I
<br>
have a good measure of how &quot;exciting&quot; our world is.  You seem to take it
<br>
that the answer is &quot;not very exciting&quot;, but I don't see it that way at
<br>
all.
<br>
<p>If the question is whether a posthuman would find us exciting enough, I
<br>
think I can say: there's at least a mediocre chance that we might be
<br>
interesting *enough*, based on the absurd computational power posthumanity
<br>
would have at its disposal.  But this is enough to get the sim argument
<br>
going; the chances have to be almost *nil* to stop the train.
<br>
<p>As for the argument about suffering, I think this is argument is utterly
<br>
misplaced.  I don't need a posthuman theodicy to think that there's a
<br>
reasonable chance that an interested posthuman with arbitrarily large
<br>
resources might rehearse the brief history of life on Earth in ver mind,
<br>
perhaps in great detail, and that's all it takes to get the sim argument
<br>
off the ground.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As such, simulations that allow us to question it are probably very
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rare.
</em><br>
<p>This is a substantially better argument, but I don't like it in this
<br>
version.
<br>
<p>In particular, what do you mean by &quot;allow us to question&quot;?  If you mean
<br>
that most such simulations would probably include some simulated physical
<br>
law that would prevent us from questioning whether we were simulations,
<br>
that seems much too extreme, and probably wrong.
<br>
<p>A simulation of, say, humanity's philosophical development couldn't
<br>
*possibly* be complete without allowing people to consider the possibility
<br>
that they are in a simulation, God's dream, or what-have-you.  This
<br>
argument amounts to saying that in most sim universes, movies like The
<br>
Matrix would be prevented by physics itself.  A cool superhero movie would
<br>
be possible, but considering the brain-in-a-vat case wouldn't...?  This
<br>
seems absurd.  Why wouldn't they just let us consider the possibility
<br>
without giving us a practical use for this information?
<br>
<p>And, if not physical law, then what exactly would be preventing us from
<br>
questioning it?
<br>
<p>Maybe I'm letting &quot;question&quot; be too weak.  There's another analogous
<br>
argument which, I think, might be more successful: simulations in which it
<br>
would be USEFUL to know that one were in a simulation might be quite rare.
<br>
Call this the argument from pragmatism.
<br>
<p>Of course, this flies in the face of Hanson's &quot;How to Live in a
<br>
Simulation&quot; paper, (which advocates that, in a simulation, you should try
<br>
to be interesting, entertaining, praiseworthy, and all around impressive,)
<br>
especially in light of your argument that they'd NEVER simulate a world
<br>
like ours because it would be too boring.  I think if you really believe
<br>
that only extra extra interesting worlds would be simulated, you'd reject
<br>
my suggested argument from pragmatism, and conclude, with Hanson, that
<br>
there WOULD be a use for the simulation argument.
<br>
<p>With that said, I think that *because* your excitement and suffering
<br>
arguments fail, so does the argument from pragmatism gain force.
<br>
Posthumans could, it seems to me, simulate us in *arbitrary* detail; the
<br>
more detailed the simulation, the less utility there would be in following
<br>
Hanson's advice.  Maybe just being a human on Earth at such-and-such a
<br>
time is good enough to get you on the list of people who participated in a
<br>
pivotal event, the birth of posthumanity, and so no further toadying to
<br>
your simulated masters will be of practical use to you.
<br>
<p>On the other hand, I said:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Here, I think, you have missed the point of this argument.  Many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; transhumanists still seem to believe that *we* will create simulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; environments, in which it will be impossible for our simulated subjects to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; falsify the claim that they are in a simulation.  This is a solid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; prediction that makes claims about what kinds of worlds there will be:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; namely, that there will be some simulated worlds that we'll make.
</em><br>
<p>... and, of course, you missed the obvious response, which I only just now
<br>
noticed myself: the simulation argument does NOT make any predictions on
<br>
this point, but only claims to be a refutation of a prediction *if we
<br>
aren't in a simulation*.
<br>
<p>But it is precisely the point that we'll have no practical tests for
<br>
whether we're in a simulation for quite a long time, if ever.  Therefore
<br>
there is no prediction being made here: only a prediction in combination
<br>
with a metaphysical view.
<br>
<p>There's something wrong with this, but it's not the verification
<br>
principle: the problem is that the information in question is useless.
<br>
We should act the same regardless of whether we're in a *detailed
<br>
posthuman* simulation.  Hanson can't give you any advice for such a case,
<br>
and neither can anyone else.
<br>
<p>Still, it is interesting to note that there are non-glitch events which
<br>
would count as a *confirmation* that we're in a simulation: if we simulate
<br>
our own ancestors, that makes it very *very* likely that we're in a
<br>
simulation.  Not that we'd care, at all, but it'd still be, ya know,
<br>
interesting.  (Like all metaphysical philosophical discussions.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Name me one transhumanist who wants to build a world as mundane as this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one with our levels of tragedy and suffering.
</em><br>
<p>At times, Tipler seems to argue that we would be simulated (or, as he
<br>
calls it, &quot;ressurected&quot;) precisely as we were, and/or in certain kinds of
<br>
indistinguishable &quot;educational worlds&quot; that would teach us to be better;
<br>
hence any Tiplerian transhumanists of that vein would meet my criteria.
<br>
<p>Certainly many of us have entertained the idea of ancestor-simulations in
<br>
what we took to be a realistic fashion, though I don't think anyone has
<br>
gone to the mat arguing that we WILL do ancestor-simulations.  If you
<br>
doubt me, I suppose I can go archive-diving, but I won't slog through that
<br>
pointless task merely for your amusement. ;)
<br>
<p>But remember that anybody who simply thinks that there's a good chance (or
<br>
even a FAIR chance!) that we'll run detailed ancestor-simulations would
<br>
fall prey to the argument.  I'd argue that it would include a great many
<br>
Extropians of at least one time or another... it'd be hard to prove this,
<br>
of course, because, in general, nobody stands on a soapbox and argues for
<br>
such boringly wishy-washy propositions, but given that we're all
<br>
dynamically practical optimists and that ancestor-simulations would be so
<br>
easy for a plausible posthuman, I think I'm on pretty strong ground in
<br>
saying &quot;many Extropians.&quot;
<br>
<p>But remember that nobody needs to offer a convincing argument that
<br>
ancestor-simulations are *certain* for any posthuman worth vis salt.  As
<br>
far as the probable interest in ancestor-simulations is concerned, we'd
<br>
just need to argue that it's not that unlikely, i.e. that f[I] is nowhere
<br>
near as small as even 100/f[P]/N[I] and so the product f[P]f[I]N[I] is
<br>
still huge and f[sim] is nearly 1.
