</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; self-deceptive?  Or are you overestimating the extent to which your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; own circumstances and motives are special?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree our actual choices tend to be piecemeal, but unfortunately this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mostly raises the costs of being rational.
</em><br>
<p>Why?  It looks to me like the costs are lowered, because you acquire both 
<br>
costs and benefits incrementally, rather than acquiring all the costs at 
<br>
once, as you seemed to assume earlier.  You get coping skills along with 
<br>
any new challenges, and it takes a while to get good enough that there are 
<br>
significant challenges arising from the debiasing of self-deception.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Our natural habits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thought include our each believing that while most people are biased in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many ways, we are more rational than others.  This is part of our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general over-estimation of our ability and moral value.  Most people 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actually know about most of the standard biases that people fall for.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Literature has for many hundreds of years relied on this fact when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making fun of such biases.  Most people pay sincere lip service to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rationality, and we nod knowingly when someone mentions one of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; standard biases.  But while we might admit in general that we are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subject to the same biases, we each usually manage to avoid believing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that a particular bias applies to us in a particular situation.  If it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appears otherwise, we can point to particular factors that make this an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exception.
</em><br>
<p>According to your theory, wouldn't this *reduce* the cost of adhering to 
<br>
rationality during the early stages?
