<p><em>&gt; &gt; I can't think of a more worthy Extropian goal than by increasing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; average human lifespan by eliminating Cancer!
</em><br>
<p>This pings something that I wind up thinking about most mornings on the way to 
<br>
work.
<br>
<p>UT Medical Center in Knoxville and the UT Health Science Center in Memphis are 
<br>
going in partnership with a Tennessee oncology practice to found the UT 
<br>
Cancer Institute (opening in Knoxville this Sunday; a new building is being 
<br>
constructed for the UTCI in Memphis not very far from where I work at the 
<br>
College of Pharmacy. Apparently, from a number of billboards in the Memphis 
<br>
area and TV spots on area broadcast stations, the UT Cancer Institute has 
<br>
adopted the motto &quot;One goal: eradication.&quot;
<br>
<p>Perhaps I'm misinformed, but my understanding of carcinogenesis leads me to 
<br>
believe that eradication/elimination of cancer is well nigh impossible; 
<br>
apparently there are a lot of things that can cause cancer, and some of them 
<br>
(like normal background radiation) seem to be with us always. Is eradication 
<br>
of cancer really a reasonable goal?
<br>
<p>I'm not minimizing the importance of cancer research here; the search for 
<br>
cures is important. Even if cancer can't be eliminated, a world where cancers 
<br>
are easily cured and not as deadly as they are now is still a laudable goal 
<br>
to work for.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
<p>Len Cleavelin
<br>
<p>---------------------
<br>
<p>You've got it right, eradication meaning easy and effective treatment,
<br>
elimination of it as a major cause of death, and not the plain meaning.
<br>
Do for cancer what medicine has done for tooth decay.  Although, this may
<br>
be optimistic--new cancer incidence rises, perhaps exponentially, with
<br>
increasing age.  But if your first dozen or two cancers are cured, you
<br>
live long enough to die of something else.
<br>
<p>Most cancers are suppressed by the immune system, and stepping up immune
<br>
surveillance through 'cancer immunization' or something as yet unthought
<br>
of could eliminate most cancer.  But that's optimistic.
<br>
<p>Jim Lund
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>I'd say *very* optimistic.  Some of us believe (on pretty good evidence) 
<br>
that a base-minimum of neoplasia is a &quot;cost of living&quot;.  The &quot;life 
<br>
style&quot; stuff (environmentally-related) can be reduced almost certainly. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The rest, well...
