<br>
&lt;&lt;Not necessarily.  Software architecture/design is not a matter of mere 
<br>
knowledge.   We don't know precisely what it takes to produce such people and 
<br>
<p>they are at a premium.  Of course, to compensate projects sometimes just 
<br>
&quot;bang on it till it more or less works&quot;.    The results speak for 
<br>
themselves.  
<br>
Bottom line, stay close to what your heart loves.  You want have much of an 
<br>
edge or be happy otherwise.  Don't just go for the money.   It kills 
<br>
creativity. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, and the jobs that are off-shored makes the US dependent on people who do 
<br>
not have the self-interest of the US (let alone the human species at heart). 
<br>
Staying close to what one's heart loves is indeed sage advice. But this rant 
<br>
isn't about me whining against competition. It is a rant against the acceptance 
<br>
of the way many corporations, especially the fortune 500, have sent jobs 
<br>
overseas, which seems to destabilize the US economy.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Our apparent success is largely based on some dicey book keeping when you 
<br>
consider the true Federal Debt and that we are headed into deflation with no 
<br>
margin to play normal monetarist tweaking games. 
<br>
<p>- samantha&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>I completely agree that deceptive book keeping is the order of the day with 
<br>
the Fortune 500, in order to deceive stockholders into investing in overvalued 
<br>
companies.
<br>
These companies have decided that they will continue to deceive stockholders 
<br>
into believing that because they have saved money by sending jobs overseas, it 
<br>
has the same value as producing new goods and services, which it clearly does 
<br>
not. 
<br>
<p>I am a pragmatist regarding economics, and as the deficiencies of those 
<br>
running the marketplace become apparent, then its the Command Economy, it is!  The 
<br>
nation-state is not the best form of government, but until we build 
<br>
international institutions over time, that help rather then hinder the human condition, 
<br>
we must look to looking after ourselves. Who else will?
