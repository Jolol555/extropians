<p><em>&gt; I edited out more of the discussion above because it all comes down to

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; situations?
</em><br>
<p>I'd like to add another argument to Eliezer's &quot;Just Be Rational&quot; argument.
<br>
(This is apparently one of those rare occasions when intelligent people
<br>
remind me of Nancy Reagan.)
<br>
<p>Robin, you suggest that you can think of a non-trivial number of
<br>
situations in which we should be willing to give up the instrumental
<br>
advantages of truth to obtain other things, perhaps even in day-to-day
<br>
life.  I think that the sort of cases you might be considering fall into
<br>
three distinct classes: the wireheaded, the rare, and the heuristic.
<br>
<p>The first category, the wireheaded, includes cases where you'll be happy
<br>
that your goal was met by simply believing that your goal was met, even
<br>
though it wasn't.  I think this class has its defeat laid at its own feat:
<br>
if you are anything like rational, it is against your goals, whatever they
<br>
may be, to wirehead.  Your goal is an objective aside from its own
<br>
satisfaction... to the extent that you do something else instead of
<br>
satisfying your goals, especially to the extent that you do something that
<br>
makes it substantially less likely that they would be satisfied, you
<br>
violate your own goals.
<br>
<p>The second category, the rare, is the category Eliezer himself has
<br>
thoroughly maligned: it includes those cases which ethical philosophers
<br>
might consider but which would, in fact, be so rare that considering them
<br>
would have net negative utility.  Of those, I think, no more need be said.
<br>
<p>But another final category might include cases in which we act on
<br>
approximating models, where the fundamental objects, properties and
<br>
relations in those models may not actually exist in the real world, not
<br>
even as &quot;compositions&quot; of real lower level objects.  We use heuristic
<br>
models like these all the time to do our jobs and cope with the world; we
<br>
often act on these models automatically or on reflex.  What's more, it's
<br>
obvious how, given the actual structure of our minds, setting these
<br>
behaviors up as reflexes might sometimes be a good idea.
<br>
<p>But in all of the cases of this kind, I take it that if a well-informed
<br>
person (that is, someone who knew of a particular more accurate but less
<br>
usable model) assumed one of these models, even acted on it by reflex,
<br>
that person should not, on the whole, really *believe* in the models as
<br>
fundamentally accurate or true.  A well-informed person takes these false
<br>
approximations as tools.  He or she need not make a leap of faith and
<br>
*agree* with these models in order to get the job done.
<br>
<p><p>OK, so let's consider your actual objections now with these categories in
<br>
mind.  You suggest, for example, that I might believe that my hypothetical
<br>
spouse is faithful, in order to maintain the happiness of my marriage.
<br>
(Of course, this is just a special case of group loyalty, where the group
<br>
is a small family.)
<br>
<p>Well, there are really *two* ways in which that could be instrumentially
<br>
beneficial; these need to be teased apart in order to properly understand
<br>
the example.  First, to the extent that you simply believe that your
<br>
spouse is faithful, you may believe yourself to have a successful
<br>
marriage, and may therefore be happy.  Second, to the extent that you
<br>
*act* as if your spouse is faithful, you won't, for example, obviously
<br>
withhold trust from your spouse, which may (on the whole) benefit you and
<br>
your marriage.
<br>
<p>The first instrumental &quot;benefit&quot; is just a special case of wireheading.
<br>
And it doesn't make any more sense here than it does in general.  You
<br>
_want_ a successful marriage; you don't want to *believe* that you have a
<br>
successful marriage.  So, on this dimension, which is separate and
<br>
orthogonal from the latter instrumental benefit of action, there is no
<br>
instrumental benefit in believing a falsehood.
<br>
<p>But as we can clearly see by separating out the effects, the latter
<br>
benefit can be acquired simply by *acting as if* the spouse were faithful:
<br>
don't accuse, don't divorce, don't act any differently at all, just go
<br>
about your life knowing what you know.  You can argue as to whether that
<br>
may or may not be the right thing to do, but what you can't argue is
<br>
whether you could *do* it without going off the deep end and actually
<br>
*believing a known falsehood*.
<br>
<p>Or could you?  Certainly it could be the case that, despite your attempts
<br>
to be on your best behavior, your spouse might see through your act,
<br>
realize that you know, and could then ruin the marriage somehow.  Sure,
<br>
it's possible, but this is a stereotypical case of the &quot;rare&quot; class that
<br>
Eliezer has already said so much against: what are the odds that, in order
<br>
for your goals to be accomplished, you not only need to *act* on an
<br>
incorrect model, but *believe* in that incorrect model, to get that last
<br>
0.1% of instrumental value?  What are the odds that you'd do this by
<br>
mistake and get yourself into even more serious trouble?  That's what we
<br>
mean when we talk about net negative benefit.
<br>
<p><p>This is just one example, but I assert that the same applies to any and
<br>
all of the counter-examples you had in mind, especially if they're special
<br>
cases of group loyalty.  Either you can get the benefit by &quot;acting-as-if&quot;,
<br>
or you've fallen for wireheading, or your case is so rare that it's not
<br>
worth considering.
<br>
<p><p>Hence, with the use of approximating models, we can get 99% of the value
<br>
of believing a falsehood without actually doing so.  This bolsters
<br>
Eliezer's argument in the rarity of those &quot;rare&quot; cases (in which going off
<br>
the deep end and actually believing a known falsehood would be
<br>
beneficial); furthermore, it supports the claim that the rare cases really
<br>
do have trivially low pay-offs, especially when compared to the odds that
<br>
you might make a mistake, as well as the penalties that you might incur.
