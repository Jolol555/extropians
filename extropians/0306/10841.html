<br>
<p><em>    &gt; I'm advocating for more information for the consumer
</em><br>
<p>Right. I'm for motherhood and apple pie too.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; You seem to stumble on a contradiction here:
</em><br>
<p>Do I? Well good, contradictions and paradoxes are always stimulating and can
<br>
be fun, lets see what you got.
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;on one hand, you think  that people protesting GM are protesting the
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;wrong thing
</em><br>
<p>OK, yes that's true.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; On the other hand, you trust their judgment in
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; buying the right things
</em><br>
<p>Oh dear that's not a very good conundrum now is it. I trust their judgment
<br>
100% to buy the things they want to buy and that's all I trust.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;What i think is that, without proper  information, people often make
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;the WRONG choice.
</em><br>
<p>Without relevant information people could make the wrong choice, I think
<br>
GM information is more relevant than the astrological sign of the farmer who
<br>
grew the food, but not by much. Many would disagree with me however,
<br>
they'd say nothing is more important than astrology.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; it just feels wasteful to go to such great lengths just to
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; see if that red fluid in a bottle is orange juice or colored water.
</em><br>
<p>But what reason is there to think that laws and the bloated government
<br>
departments that always grow around them like a cancer will stop somebody
<br>
selling colored water as orange juice better than the market can?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; And who are you to tell people what they should protest?
</em><br>
<p>If people want to protest GM food they can, I wouldn't dream of
<br>
stopping them but I do feel free to call them unwise for doing so.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;If the free  market of ideas brings billions of $ to football
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;players and nothing to cryonics research, well, that's just
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;free market at work. Judging from what I read in your post,
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;you should approve those choices.
</em><br>
<p>It's not perfect, is that a surprise? I've said this before and people
<br>
think I'm joking but I am not; the free market is only the second
<br>
best system, without a doubt the best way to organize society is
<br>
just to have everybody do exactly what John K Clark tells them to do.
<br>
Unfortunately for some reason I've had a bit of difficulty convincing
<br>
others of the wisdom of this approach so I have to settle for second best.
<br>
