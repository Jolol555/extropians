<p>Indian commerce minister attacks US states for anti-outsourcing moves
<br>
<p>NEW DELHI (AFP) Jun 17, 2003
<br>
Indian Commerce Minister Arun Jaitley said Tuesday that attempts by some 
<br>
states in the United States to ban information technology outsourcing from other 
<br>
countries amounted to a denial of market access.&quot;Such moves are vitiating the 
<br>
environment as it is tantamount to denying market access in an area in which 
<br>
India has core competence,&quot; he told reporters.
<br>
<p>&quot;Bringing in such legislation interferes with market forces,&quot; he added.
<br>
<p>New Jersey, Maryland, Connecticut and Washington have been considering 
<br>
stopping outsourcing their government information technology (IT) work.
<br>
<p>Jaitley said the only silver lining was that US Trade Representative Robert 
<br>
Zoellick had told him during a recent meeting in the United States that the 
<br>
federal government was opposed to the move and called it &quot;bad policy.&quot;
<br>
<p>The federal government should not silently watch developments, but ought to 
<br>
dissuade states from implementing any ban, he added.
<br>
<p>The move would mean the United States was practising the opposite of what it 
<br>
preached in multilateral forums where it argues for greater market access and 
<br>
free trade.
<br>
<p>India's IT industry has been worried because such a ban would have a direct 
<br>
impact on one of its fastest growing business areas.
<br>
<p>The outsourcing sector grew about 60 percent in the year to March and is 
<br>
projected to surge by 55 percent to 3.6 billion dollars in the current financial 
<br>
year.
<br>
<p>Last year the business process outsourcing sector accounted for about a 
<br>
quarter of the total revenue of the information technology sector in India.
