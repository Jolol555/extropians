<em>&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, most debates about this get bogged down
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in differences between definitions of &quot;same&quot; and similar
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; words and phrases, without the debaters seeming to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; aware of that.  I was just trying to head off another iteration
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of &quot;extropians talking past each other&quot;.  :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I have been saying this for a couple of years now.  The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; whole upload/copy question is a matter of semantics.  
</em><br>
<p>If that was so some definitions could be agreed up front 
<br>
or failing that there would at least be grounds for what I
<br>
think Eliezer sees as agreeing to disagree.
<br>
<p>But it takes time to define the terms up front and its harder 
<br>
to do on a list with multiple participants than it is with say
<br>
just two people. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People don't disagree on the facts of  the operation. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; They disagree on terms and labels.  Do we call the two
</em><br>
<em>&gt; results the &quot;same&quot; or &quot;different&quot;?  In many ways they are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same.  In many ways they are different.  It depends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the definition of same and different.  People can't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seem to understand this.  They believe that only their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; definitions are right and that only their conclusions are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  right.  What they don't see is that both sides are correct.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Having a dictionary with multiple meanings for each word,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we find that the results are different(1) from each other, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; while they are not different(2) from each other.  There is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no contradiction or compromise is this conclusion.  People
</em><br>
<em>&gt; end up arguing for their definitions and labels.  They do
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not end up talking about objective reality or even theoretical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality.  As you say, they are talking past each other.
</em><br>
<p>Don't underestimate plain old vanilla flavored ignorance here.
<br>
It could also be that some topics require a familiarity with 
<br>
subject matter that is just not easily acquired without putting
<br>
in some background learning. I find I feel that I am up against
<br>
this in some areas relating to Baysian reasoning and quantum
<br>
mechanics just to name two. With Baysian reasoning I mostly
<br>
just haven't done the necessary reading. With quantum mechanics
<br>
the problem in a bit different in that quantum mechanics really is 
<br>
according to the likes of Bohr genuinely difficult and counter
<br>
intuitive to the way we normally perceive the world. My point is
<br>
that in my case and I imagine in the case of quite a few others it
<br>
is not an inability to come to agree on terms or to be persuaded
<br>
to the truth of a superior argument or world view. The problem
<br>
is, I think, that it takes a substantial investment of time for those
<br>
who know to give those who don't the necessary background. 
<br>
If one has to go and do the reading oneself the old old fashioned
<br>
way its often less fun.
<br>
<p>I think a list referenceable wiki or a faq on frequently recurring 
<br>
topics would enable those who know more than beginners to provide
<br>
a cross reference to extropian flavored primers. Then perhaps the
<br>
terms are more defined and clear when the discussion starts. Wheels
<br>
woundn't get reinvented so much as refined. 
<br>
<p>The point has been made the if extropians were to produce a 
<br>
wiki or database of topics frequently revisited that we'd be 
<br>
reproducing work already done elsewhere. That might be 
<br>
true. But if extropians are to be a different brand of transhumanism
<br>
perhaps they do need to put down deeper roots at the cost
<br>
of some redundancy to be a distinctive brand. 
<br>
<p>Also some people on the list seem to be predominantly interested
<br>
in getting at the truth, whatever the truth happens to be, and this
<br>
is for them a personal quest. Others like me are less interested in
<br>
truth for its own sake but are rather concerned with those domains
<br>
of inquiry which they perceive will have the biggest impact on 
<br>
realising particular extropic goals such as in my case life extension.
<br>
<p>My bias probably gives me a fixation on wanting to get memes 
<br>
propagated using extropes as vectors that are likely to influence
<br>
public policy and help create or at least avoid the implementation
<br>
of blocking legislation and prohibitive social policies. I don't really
<br>
care that democracy or the law are flawed, for me its enough to
<br>
know that these things will probably outlive me so I'd rather 
<br>
work within the less than ideal systems to achieve what I see as
<br>
the main goals (life extension) first. This main goal is complicated
<br>
by a recognition that it may not be best achieved by a frontal 
<br>
assault. Cryonics and uploading may be harder to sell than cancer
<br>
cures and stem cell research. Also it is very difficult to get 
<br>
transhumanists to pull together on particular causes because their
<br>
various ages and expectations about the rate of development of
<br>
technologies differ so much from one to another.
<br>
<p>If one holds as Virge Verner does, and I think Eliezer does that
<br>
the singularity is coming between 2005 and 2030 within their lifespan
<br>
and irrespective of whether they personally act to bring it on or not,
<br>
then one is likely to be less concerned with changing  memesets
<br>
about stem cells and cryonics in 2003.
<br>
<p>There is such a divergence of views and assumptions on the nature
<br>
of progress and the likelihood that individually we will be around 
<br>
to see it in our lifetimes that it is very hard to get transhumanists to
<br>
agree on priorities towards pursuing change. Unlike the luddites
<br>
we don't easy rally because there is no obvious common battle line. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
I hope not to need cryonics, but it occurs to me that it just could
<br>
be the case that the best place to make a proactive stand, to take 
<br>
the battle up to the luddites is on the issue of cryonics. Cryonics
<br>
is likely the only chance for some extropes and likely the only 
<br>
chance for some elderly members of the community. It could be
<br>
the place where the most transhumanist troops can be rallied. It
<br>
could switch transhumanists from defensive disorganised fighting
<br>
against fear to an offensive fighting for hope. But at present the 
<br>
case for cryonics has not been particularly well made. Or perhaps
<br>
it just hasn't been made well enough for *me* to think that *I*
<br>
could sell it to the general community and use it even theoretically
<br>
as a rallying point. I note that it has not really been successfully sold 
<br>
by others either.
