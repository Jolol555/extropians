<em>&gt; Subject: Re: spike tv
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;actually it isn't quite like a patent; so you won't have to change your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;name. Patents have different subject matter altogether; a name can't be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;patented.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I should hope not.  This case is a clear example of the absurdity to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which intellectual property law has descended.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel obligated to disagree. First, I think the appropriate NY law is
<br>
commercial misappropriation. This would entitle the complainant to
<br>
injunctive relief (ie tells violator to stop doing that) and damages if
<br>
there are any.  It is a privacy tort ( tort as in civil wrong, not as in
<br>
torte which is yummy).  I am not much into legal theorizing (so far I am
<br>
just trying to learn the law I need to pass the bar) and I don't mind at all
<br>
if anyone wants to give me a piece of their mind on this.  My view is that
<br>
this case (I skimmed the article you linked to) is to have very limited
<br>
effect. What seems to be happening is that Spike Lee, a very well known
<br>
director, is complaining that if someone creates a TV channel called Spike
<br>
TV, then most people are going to associate it with him -- that is, with
<br>
Spike Lee. By that association, Spike TV would profit off of misleading the
<br>
public.  I hope I am being clear; I have a migraine and am behind on studies
<br>
for today's class. Ask me to clarify if need be.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not personally being very knowledgeable about Spike Lee, I can say that
<br>
I would have assumed the association between Spike TV and Spike Lee. Spike
<br>
Lee would be correct to be concerned, wouldn't he? What if people assumed
<br>
that Spike Lee was behind or endorsed Spike TV and Spike TV turned out to be
<br>
scandalous thereby tarnishing Spike Lee's image? I think it is agreed that
<br>
once image has been tarnished via the media, it is hard to ever polish that
<br>
image back to the original shine. (I don't like the phrasing I am using.
<br>
Chalk it up to migraine please.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The limited effect of this case is so far simply to tell the violator to
<br>
stop using Spike TV in name; for now. The case will likely proceed to court
<br>
soon where there will be a permanent injunction (ie Spike TV will have to
<br>
think of another name or somehow disassociate itself from  Spike Lee in the
<br>
public eye. Perhaps &quot;Spike TV. We have nothing to do with Spike Lee. Spike
<br>
Lee doesn't endorse Spike TV.&quot; )
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The case is not anything new. By that I mean, there are many cases in
<br>
which celebrities have sued to stop someone from using their pictures,
<br>
voice, name to advertise without consent of the celebrity. I think these
<br>
cases are just. I wouldn't want, were I famous, someone appropriating my
<br>
likeness to advertise -- especially to advertise something I didn't agree
<br>
with.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am too long winded. I think I made my points.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;This case is more akin to trademark infringement. It is a NY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;state law, not federal law that the complaint relies on.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually I am extremely pleased that there will soon be a guy channel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; called spike TV.  The glory of it all: car races, fight movies, Bay
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Watch, World Rassling Championships, 24-7!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;actually, as of now, there will not be a Spike TV. Spike Lee has an
<br>
injunction against the use of the name for the TV channel, for now.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; Women must think we guys are all idiots.  {8^D
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmmm. Does what we think really matter? It won't change the
<br>
underlying truth. ;)
