&lt;&lt;Well, someone is bold enough to propose some really
<br>
radical solutions that just might work.  See:
<br>
<p>The Failure of NASA: And a Way Out
<br>
by Philip K. Chapman
<br>
<a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03zn1.html">http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03zn1.html</a>
<br>
<p>Robert&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>He's bold enough to propose his solutions, but after reading the 3 pages of 
<br>
the author's article, I get the feeling that they are less workable than he 
<br>
suggests.
<br>
<p>1) I believe the end of the Apollo project was due only to the lack of 
<br>
national compettiton from the USSR. Once the space race was won, public interest all 
<br>
but vanished.
<br>
<p>2) All these aerospace engineers are as good at economic estimates as I 
<br>
am-which is to say-negative.
<br>
<p>3) We need some primary breakthroughs, either in new inventions, or 
<br>
innovations 
<br>
the improvement of capability of already known technologies. Private 
<br>
industry, unless its got plenty of tax dollars headed its way, will not see the need 
<br>
to participate in space habitation. 
<br>
<p>4) Because of the above listed factors, I suspect that his ACCESS replacement 
<br>
of NASA won't work, because the basic facts on the ground have not changed. 
<br>
<p>Only technical development to make travel to space for industry, or the 
<br>
discovery of miracle materials-only available from the asteroids, Moon, or Mars; 
<br>
which will compel the private sector to invest, and invest mightily.
<br>
<p>So what is my answer? Breakthroughs, in engineering, materials science, 
<br>
chemical engineering, biological apps. Fund these, and commerical space travel and 
<br>
habitation will follow. Let the be underfunded, and we as a species will wait 
<br>
the decades it will take to achieve these advances, that comes from scientific 
<br>
pursuits, in the typical hap-hazzard way.
<br>
<p>Of course, if Chapman is correct, I will deny that I have ever spoke against 
<br>
him. This post will self-destruct in 3 seconds. Much quicker if it is already 
<br>
in your kill-file. Good Luck, Jim.
