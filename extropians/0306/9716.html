<em>&gt; Of course. What I don't clearly understand (maybe I live too 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; far) is the tendency to label every opponent as the enemy of the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Constitution, as if to just disagree on some foreign political issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a sign of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; willing to destroy the country. Somehow, I doubt it. But everyone is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entitled to his opinions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can understand that Alfio, hang around a while buddy.  It takes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time.
</em><br>
<p>Our Constitution enumerates what our government can and can't do. It
<br>
also enumerates what individual rights cannot be infringed upon by
<br>
government, and it recognises that sovereign authority originates in
<br>
the individual. It also prescribes the only methods by which that
<br>
constitution can be changed.
<br>
<p>People who swear to citizenship are entering a contract with the rest
<br>
of us to honor and respect that constitution and its content.
<br>
Politicians who win office enter into a contract to protect and defend
<br>
it, as do members of the military, members of the bar, and any
<br>
government officer. To seek to change, alter, overturn, or ignore that
<br>
constitution by non-prescribed means is to act as an enemy of that
<br>
constitution.
<br>
<p>When I describe someone as an enemy of the constitution, it is
<br>
specifically because they advocate doing so or attempt such in their
<br>
public words and deeds.
<br>
<p>For example, if you want to eliminate my 2nd amendment rights, I
<br>
specifically demand that you seek to go through the Amendment process
<br>
described in the constitution to annul the 2nd amendment. Anything else
<br>
is unconstitutional and anti-constitutional activity.
<br>
<p>&quot;Everyone is entitled to their opinion&quot; is such a cop out. Do you think
<br>
that monarchists should bring the monarchy back to Italy? Perhaps the
<br>
Pope should rule Italy like he used to? Or the Spanish? Perhaps the
<br>
Nazis should run Germany once more...
<br>
<p>There are some opinions which, while people are entitled to them,
<br>
cannot be permitted to find fertile ground to take root in reality.
