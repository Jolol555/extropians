</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I would say this list is a bit like the intellectual salons of the 18th
<br>
century. A place where people with shared interests meet, discuss, drink
<br>
virtual coffee and come up with ideas - most of which never lead
<br>
anywhere. People attending the same salon would tend to share some basic
<br>
views or assumptions due to self-selection and the normal social
<br>
pressures limiting too great disagreements, but the remaining spread of
<br>
knowledge, specialisations and views are rich enough to produce a
<br>
creative environment. The salons never did anything, really. But the
<br>
people attending them did, inspired by ideas they got there. Some
<br>
projects didn't pan out at all. Others succeeded or at least became big
<br>
- we live in some of them today. 
<br>
<p>I think the extropians list is much in the same vein. The best it can
<br>
aspire to is to be a great salon. There is a elitistic vision ghosting
<br>
around in transhumanism that somehow we, we who get it, will be cruicial
<br>
and lead the great transcension. According to this thought we are
<br>
essential, so we must all act as one with high quality at the great
<br>
project, whatever it is (a human pyramid to orbit? ExtroCorp? The
<br>
million transhuman march?) - it is all about the movement and all its 
<br>
members. But I think this is a mistake; if transhumanism ever leads 
<br>
anywhere it will do it by acting as a source of important ideas and a 
<br>
meeting place of people that later will act together. No need to turn it 
<br>
into the Fifth International. 
<br>
<p>Hence we should guard the politeness and intellectual rigor of this 
<br>
salon, make sure the best in us all feels welcome and always seek to 
<br>
contribute great thoughts - or go out and do great deeds based on the 
<br>
thoughts we have overheard.
