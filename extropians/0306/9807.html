<p>
By Greg Taylor of The Daily Grail - The beginnings of a book 
<br>
manuscript, &quot;Debunking for Dummies.&quot;
<br>
<p>Looking for a new hobby? Why not try 'debunking', which seems to be 
<br>
growing in popularity and requires little except a narrow viewpoint 
<br>
and a handful of faulty arguments. Let's be clear from the outset 
<br>
though - we mustn't confuse debunking with 'skepticism'. The latter 
<br>
requires broad knowledge, critical thinking, and the ability to 
<br>
doubt your own viewpoint as much as any other. Obviously a much 
<br>
tougher proposition, as the lack of true proponents shows, so I 
<br>
would advise against trying this unless you are a serious masochist, 
<br>
or at the very least a true seeker of knowledge.
<br>
<p>The first step in becoming a debunker is to immediately relinquish 
<br>
that title and establish your credentials by calling yourself either 
<br>
a skeptic or a scientist. Never mind that you are actually trying to 
<br>
impose your personal viewpoint on others, rather than following the 
<br>
scientific process and applying critical thinking to all sides of 
<br>
the argument. Actually, the best debunkers are those that don't even 
<br>
know their true identity, having such poor critical thinking skills 
<br>
that they truly believe that that they are exhibiting all the open-
<br>
mindedness and mental sharpness of the true skeptic or scientist. As 
<br>
such, some might reprimand me for writing this short article, seeing 
<br>
it as a hazard to the serious debunker's faith in themselves - 
<br>
little chance of this however, as the real top-notch debunkers have 
<br>
a force-field of ignorance that is nigh impenetrable.
<br>
<p>Okay, next you'll need a few handy tools. The best method, being a 
<br>
pseudo-skeptic, will be to take some of the skeptic's best tools and 
<br>
misuse them. First up, that venerable favourite, Occam's Razor, 
<br>
which implies that the simplest explanation is often the best. The 
<br>
trick for the debunker is to take Occam's Razor and use it not as a 
<br>
handy rule of thumb to aid critical thinking, but instead to impose 
<br>
it as a literal and immutable law of the universe which immediately 
<br>
destroys your opponent's arguments. Don't worry that complicated 
<br>
things happen all the time, thus disproving the 'Law of Occam'. That 
<br>
would make things complicated.
<br>
<p>Just in case you're caught without your bag of tricks, and cornered 
<br>
by a rabid pack of irrational pseudo-scientists, I recommend busting 
<br>
out a move I like to call 'The Extraordinary Sagan'. Espouse with 
<br>
great enthusiasm that 'extraordinary claims require extraordinary 
<br>
evidence'. Ignore the fact that a true scientist would say that all 
<br>
claims require the same proportion of evidence. Someone might even 
<br>
point out this statement isn't meant to be taken literally, but 
<br>
should be seen in terms of the acquired evidence of human experience 
<br>
(e.g. if you know from past experience throughout your life that a 
<br>
ball falls down when you drop it, and then someone says their ball 
<br>
fell 'up' yesterday, you would require evidence of a proportion to 
<br>
prove this singular event over the accumulated evidence of your life 
<br>
experience). The best thing is, you can apply this to all sorts of 
<br>
things inappropriately, like the discovery of a secret chamber, lost 
<br>
city, or lost knowledge, where the application of acquired knowledge 
<br>
is virtually without merit.
<br>
<p>There are plenty of other tools and techniques to be had, and 
<br>
mastered, with a minimum of effort. Found a fraud, or a badly 
<br>
performed experiment? Immediately use &quot;guilt by association&quot; to 
<br>
apply this judgement to all researchers and theories in this 
<br>
particular line of inquiry. Did somebody earn some money, or at 
<br>
least get a small grant for their research? Obviously, you can tar 
<br>
them with the brush of the con-man, or at the very least label them 
<br>
opportunists, who are not at all interested in scientific integrity 
<br>
(because we all know that scientists and skeptics don't make any 
<br>
money). The following chapters outline the best methods(1)
<br>
<p>Okay, so I'm being facetious. Satire can sometimes provide the 
<br>
harshest realisations, and with my use of it here I expose my 
<br>
particular prejudice and desire - namely to remove the debunker's 
<br>
smug air of respectability and intellectual superiority, and expose 
<br>
them for what they really are: a pseudo-skeptic. I'm playing on the 
<br>
title of 'pseudo-scientist', of course, a term which every pseudo-
<br>
skeptic is quick to label their adversary with when their arguments 
<br>
are starting to fail. The problem in this case, is that the pseudo-
<br>
skeptic has as much understanding of 'science' as they do 
<br>
of 'skepticism' - very little at all.
<br>
<p>The derivation of the word science comes from the Latin scientia, 
<br>
meaning 'knowledge'. Science has always been, at its core, the 
<br>
search for knowledge. Early Indian science is seen as including such 
<br>
things as yoga, which was a systematic approach to gaining knowledge 
<br>
about the mind, and the relationship between consciousness and the 
<br>
cosmos. Early Greek science was influenced by Pythagorean thought; 
<br>
that there is a correspondence between the workings of the human 
<br>
mind and nature, through numbers and music. Indeed, most sciences 
<br>
began as a mode of inquiry into man's place within the cosmos. Human 
<br>
consciousness was obviously of high importance - from yoga and 
<br>
Pythagorean thought, through to the Kabbalah and magic, throughout 
<br>
the ages man has developed systems of mapping and exploring 
<br>
consciousness and has held the knowledge gained through these 
<br>
practices in the highest regard. If science truly is a search for 
<br>
knowledge, one might ask who has more right to be called a 
<br>
scientist - a Kabbalist or a taxonomist?
<br>
<p>The modern conception of science, which the debunker holds so dear, 
<br>
is based upon a particular branch of science which has become 
<br>
dominant over the past four centuries. To grossly simplify 
<br>
historical developments, the physics of Newton and the philosophy of 
<br>
Descartes combined with other factors during the 'Enlightenment', to 
<br>
give central importance of one strand of science - modern science, 
<br>
as we know it. This science is basically physicalism - &quot;the belief 
<br>
that reality is reducible to certain kinds of physical entities&quot;(2) 
<br>
(and if you want illustration of this, ask a group of physicists and 
<br>
chemists whether psychology is a science). With this newly dominant 
<br>
science came 'the scientific method'. Many people are surprised to 
<br>
learn that the scientific method is not a gift from god which 
<br>
determines whether something is 'scientific' - it is actually one 
<br>
method of gaining results, amongst a number of possible others (put 
<br>
forward throughout history, from the Gnostics through to Karl 
<br>
Popper). The fact cannot be overstated - the modern scientific 
<br>
method which the pseudo-skeptic virtually deifies, is simply one 
<br>
particular method of revealing information about one particular type 
<br>
of knowledge.
<br>
<p>A first criticism of this deified science, which pseudo-skeptics 
<br>
fail to grasp, is that although modern science is a mode of 
<br>
knowledge which is particularly conducive to maintaining bodily 
<br>
survival, it is not as helpful with the actual 'living' part. 
<br>
Physicalism trivialises the human experience, reducing it to the 
<br>
interactions of chemicals and 'pure physics', leaving no room for a 
<br>
spirit or soul. An example is in the 'scientific' explanations for 
<br>
NDE's (Near Death Experiences) - as much as someone who has 
<br>
experienced an NDE may be told various possible physical reasons for 
<br>
the onset of an NDE, very rarely do they hold much weight. The 
<br>
awareness that occurs during such events is not something that can 
<br>
be described by a physical process, hence the ineffability of the 
<br>
event. To quote the aviator Charles Lindbergh, in relation to an OBE 
<br>
(Out of Body Experience) he had during his 1927 transatlantic 
<br>
flight: &quot;My visions are easily explained away through reason, but 
<br>
the longer I live, the more limited I believe rationality to be&quot;(3).
<br>
<p>Another problem with the modern scientific viewpoint is that too 
<br>
often it is considered complete. A cursory glance at the history of 
<br>
science shows, however, that this assumption has been wrongly held 
<br>
throughout the ages. Thomas Kuhn's theory of paradigm changes has 
<br>
gained quite a high level of acceptance, yet the pseudo-skeptic's 
<br>
ignorance of examples throughout history has led to some very flawed 
<br>
thinking. For example, in a recent article in the New York Times, 
<br>
Lawrence M. Krauss argued:
<br>
<p>&quot;How often have I heard the cry from the audience, 'Yeah, but 300 
<br>
years ago people would have said it would be impossible to fly!'the 
<br>
problem with that assertion is that 300 years ago people did not 
<br>
know enough about the laws of physics to make the assertion, so the 
<br>
claim would have been improper.&quot;(4)
<br>
<p>One wonders whether it crossed Mr Krauss' mind that in 300 years 
<br>
time, someone much like himself might be writing about him in the 
<br>
same terms?
<br>
<p>Two of the most famous examples of paradigm changes are Copernicus' 
<br>
heliocentric model and Einstein's Theory of Relativity. However, 
<br>
there are other smaller examples: for instance, the distinguished 
<br>
medical journal Lancet once described hypnotic subjects as trained 
<br>
criminals who were paid for their stage acting(5). Other anomalies 
<br>
that were once 'fiction' include ball lightning and meteorites. Of 
<br>
course, it has to be noted that for every 'vindicated anomaly', 
<br>
there are thousands of misconceptions, wishful thoughts, and 
<br>
outright frauds. This never invalidates investigation of anomalous 
<br>
data though, as most pseudo-skeptics would have us believe. Niels 
<br>
Bohr summed it up perfectly, when he said &quot;the task of science is 
<br>
both to extend the range of our experience and to reduce it to 
<br>
order&quot;(6). Science requires both speculation and methodical 
<br>
examination to evolve, and to deny either is madness.
<br>
<p>At this point, perhaps a quick caution to the pseudo-scientist is 
<br>
necessary: you are on a downward spiral into nazism and other 
<br>
nastiness. Or apparently so, according to the debunking fraternity. 
<br>
The BBC's Horizon feature titled &quot;Atlantis Uncovered&quot; warned against 
<br>
this 'fact'(7), portraying fringe thinking as a descent into 
<br>
irrational thought, and ultimately (of course!) National Socialism. 
<br>
Similarly Michael Shermer, in &quot;Why People Believe Weird Things: 
<br>
Pseudoscience, Superstition, and Other Confusions of our Time&quot;, 
<br>
states &quot;today's paranormal beliefs probably seem relatively 
<br>
harmless. They are not. The reason is that if someone is willing to 
<br>
accept such claims on nonexistent evidence, what else are they 
<br>
willing to believe?&quot;(8). This sort of thinking is nonsensical, as 
<br>
similar outcomes can be assigned to nearly any type of human 
<br>
endeavour. As physicist Henry Stapp argues, physicalist science on 
<br>
its own is dangerous, because it leaves &quot;no rational basis for 
<br>
anything but self-interest the collapse of moral philosophy is 
<br>
inevitable&quot;(9).
<br>
<p>But maybe the pseudo-skeptics are just referring to all those 
<br>
everyday crazy people out there, with nothing better to do but 
<br>
believe in pseudo-science and polish their jack-boots. Surely they 
<br>
think more of actual scientists who investigate anomalies with an 
<br>
open mind? Not so, apparently, if we look at the evidence in James 
<br>
('The Amazing') Randi's attack on Dr Gary Schwartz of the University 
<br>
of Arizona, who upset the gods of debunking by being foolish enough 
<br>
to initiate a scientific study of 'psychic' John Edwards (which is 
<br>
odd, seeing as one of the core values of those gods' magazine of 
<br>
choice, Skeptical Inquirer, is &quot;freedom of thought and 
<br>
inquiry&quot;(10)). In this 'debate', Randi twists words to name Schwartz 
<br>
as a believer in the tooth fairy, and resorts to about every trick 
<br>
written in the pseudo-skeptic's handbook. The reader may want to 
<br>
view a complete transcript of the dialogue at the &quot;Debunking the 
<br>
Debunkers&quot; website (11), which shows clearly where any irrationality 
<br>
lies. Interestingly, Randi only published his 'devastating critique' 
<br>
on his website (12), and not the responses, explaining that Dr 
<br>
Schwartz had &quot;issued frenzied responses to my comments, which I am 
<br>
tempted to publish here, but that would make a very long document 
<br>
indeed&quot;. 
<br>
<p>So what drives the pseudo-skeptic to such extraordinary lengths? Why 
<br>
do they attack their 'enemy' with such ferocity, and accusations of 
<br>
nazism and other name-calling?
<br>
<p>A primary motivation of the debunker would seem to be, quite simply, 
<br>
jealousy. I've grown weary of the number of times I've been told how 
<br>
unfair it is that Graham Hancock has experienced such success. But 
<br>
don't mistake this jealousy as simply being in terms of personal 
<br>
gain. James Alcock writes in Skeptical Inquirer:
<br>
<p>&quot;rather than honouring science, the public is generally disdainful 
<br>
of both science and scientist, while welcoming to their bosom the 
<br>
purveyors of magic, shamanism, and supernaturalism&quot; (13)
<br>
<p>One pertinent point to note from this statement is how pseudo-
<br>
skeptics always talk in terms of how the general public needs to be 
<br>
told what is best for them (by the pseudo-skeptic of course). And 
<br>
yet they wonder why the public is disdainful. The other point is 
<br>
that the jealousy of the debunker has at its root their deep-seated 
<br>
desire to have their particular worldview validated.
<br>
<p>So what is the underlying reason for the debunkers position? Why do 
<br>
they feel the need to &quot;portray science not as an open-minded process 
<br>
of discovery, but as a holy war against unruly hordes of quackery&quot; 
<br>
(14)? The obvious conclusion is that behind this behaviour lies a 
<br>
large amount of insecurity. In particular, anxiety that a carefully 
<br>
constructed world-view, which helps them to make sense of the world 
<br>
and also often bestows upon them a position of power, may be 
<br>
dismantled at any moment. Any attempts by 'pseudo-scientists' to 
<br>
investigate outside this world-view are regarded as a threat, an 
<br>
attempt to pull the comfortable rug out from beneath the debunker's 
<br>
feet. As much as the true skeptic harbours doubts about their 
<br>
stance, the debunker attempts to convince themselves and others, 
<br>
through any means possible, that they are right. How can the 
<br>
debunker, therefore, ever be considered anything more than a pseudo-
<br>
skeptic.
<br>
<p>That's not to say, however, that criticism of alternative theories 
<br>
is incorrect or somehow morally wrong in any way. Ideas and theories 
<br>
should always be questioned, but in a respectful manner, and with 
<br>
the humility to realise that any position may prove to be completely 
<br>
incorrect. We should always question what we believe, and also why 
<br>
we do so. In the end though, it is each person's inalienable right 
<br>
to construct a view of the world which fits the evidence of their 
<br>
experience best, and helps them to understand the world. The 
<br>
debunker does not believe in this philosophy however, and feels the 
<br>
need to impose their personal viewpoint upon others. It is high time 
<br>
that all parties showed more respect for philosophies different to 
<br>
theirs, and made an attempt to understand them. If the pseudo-
<br>
skeptic does not take my word for it, perhaps they'll listen to 
<br>
James Alcock, who wrote in Skeptical Inquirer (with the emphasis 
<br>
added being mine) &quot;we may differ in our assumptions about the 
<br>
underlying nature of reality, but we are much the same as each 
<br>
other&quot; (15).
