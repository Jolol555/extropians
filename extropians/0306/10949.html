<p><em>&gt; So, operationally from the outside and from the inside the uploaded copy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the original. I wonder then what the meaning of &quot;but the uploaded copy is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not REALLY the original&quot; can be.
</em><br>
<p>I think that you ask an excellent question, and your
<br>
analysis is not quite like anything I've seen.  To be
<br>
honest, I think that what they are thinking of is a
<br>
soul, more or less.  Yes, the notion has been forced
<br>
into the unconscious, but it's operating still.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Perhaps we should use &quot;feels like&quot; instead than the difficult &quot;is&quot;. I feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like me because I remember the things that I remember (including what I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don´t consciously remember at this moment) or, in other words, because of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the specific information coded in my brain. This is I believe the simplest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; explanation.
</em><br>
<p>Yes; in every way your uploaded copy---or even you if you
<br>
are disintegrated at 10am tomorrow morning and then instantly
<br>
re-integrated using the same or different atoms---will have
<br>
this same impression.  It could, even now, be happening a
<br>
hundred times a second.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So if the information coded in my brain is transferred somewhere
</em><br>
<em>&gt; else, someone will wake up feeling that he is me. I consider this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough, because I do not care too much about &quot;is&quot;.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I think when one dies consciousness goes on, even if that particular
</em><br>
<em>&gt; individual stream of consciousness stops. There are still thinkers thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thoughts. Of course you can accepts this as a partial &quot;answer&quot; only is you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe that each consciousness is fundamentally the same, in other words
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that there is no physical or spiritual &quot;signature&quot; other than information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that defines the difference between you and I.
</em><br>
<p>8^D  Yes---after you have taken away everything else (all
<br>
the information in your brain) then what is left over is
<br>
the pure consciousness that is the same in everyone.  And
<br>
what is that?  It's the same thing that you are left with
<br>
when you have removed all the outer layers of an onion.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So when I die &quot;I&quot; will continue as another thinker thinking other thoughts
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and remembering other things: this &quot;I&quot; (weak I) is already preserved. If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what I am interested in is preserving a &quot;strong I&quot; (the thinker who is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking these specific thoughts and remembering these specific things),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then I do not see anything wrong with uploading when it is technically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feasible.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sorry this was not very clear, perhaps language is not really equipped for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this. It would be interesting to put it in better words.
</em><br>
<p>On the contrary, I think that you have made one of the arguments
<br>
quite clear.
<br>
<p>Lee
