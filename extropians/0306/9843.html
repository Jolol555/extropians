<p>I don't agree with this. It is true that there's a savage downturn in IT,
<br>
but that doesn't mean there is no work, it just means that we can't charge
<br>
the outrageous fees that we used to. Live with it, it's a market economy. We
<br>
all benefitted wildly and disproportionately from the bubble, now we are out
<br>
in the cold for a while. It's a good opportunity to learn something...
<br>
economies have cycles, and if the boom you are in seems too good to be true,
<br>
it might be a good idea to try saving.
<br>
<p>Anyway, what's wrong with skilled Indians having jobs? Who is to say they
<br>
deserve them less (if that matters) than USians?
