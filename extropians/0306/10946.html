So, operationally from the outside and from the inside the uploaded copy is
<br>
the original. I wonder then what the meaning of &quot;but the uploaded copy is
<br>
not REALLY the original&quot; can be.
<br>
Perhaps we should use &quot;feels like&quot; instead than the difficult &quot;is&quot;. I feel
<br>
like me because I remember the things that I remember (including what I
<br>
don´t consciously remember at this moment) or, in other words, because of
<br>
the specific information coded in my brain. This is I believe the simplest
<br>
explanation. So if the information coded in my brain is transferred
<br>
somewhere else, someone will wake up feeling that he is me. I consider this
<br>
enough, because I do not care too much about &quot;is&quot;.
<br>
I think when one dies consciousness goes on, even if that particular
<br>
individual stream of consciousness stops. There are still thinkers thinking
<br>
thoughts. Of course you can accepts this as a partial &quot;answer&quot; only is you
<br>
believe that each consciousness is fundamentally the same, in other words
<br>
that there is no physical or spiritual &quot;signature&quot; other than information
<br>
that defines the difference between you and I.
<br>
So when I die &quot;I&quot; will continue as another thinker thinking other thoughts
<br>
and remembering other things: this &quot;I&quot; (weak I) is already preserved. If
<br>
what I am interested in is preserving a &quot;strong I&quot; (the thinker who is
<br>
thinking these specific thoughts and remembering these specific things),
<br>
then I do not see anything wrong with uploading when it is technically
<br>
feasible.
<br>
Sorry this was not very clear, perhaps language is not really equipped for
<br>
this. It would be interesting to put it in better words.

&gt; I agree that this delusion will become common, because operationally, from
&gt; the outside, you *will* be dealing with the same person (or an improved
&gt; version), and the duplicates, from the inside, will recall the same
&gt; memories as the original. That's built in to the premise.
