<a href="mailto:Spudboy100@aol.com?Subject=Re:%20Deep%20River/Deep%20Sleep%20[was%20Boy%20Genius%20or%20Craft%20Idiot?]">Spudboy100@aol.com</a> writes: Its not supposed to click with reality, its a means to 
<br>
pyschologically deal with unmet needs and personal frustration. When pharacology and  
<br>
technical progress overtake the problems of people's lives, then we shall see 
<br>
what remains. Until then we have the human condition to deal with.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his book Technaissance the writer McGee contends we are in the 
<br>
beginning of a new renaissance.  McGee expects to see clergy expanding into this 
<br>
area.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people are walking manifestations of the comment that when you own 
<br>
a hammer every problem is a nail.  Science is wonderful but there is a whole 
<br>
set of issues that science doesn't address at all.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Among other things religion is a small service profession.  As such it 
<br>
is a down &amp; dirty nitty gritty business.  What do you say to a family that has 
<br>
just lost a loved one?  Believe it or not good clergy have a long history of 
<br>
learning to deal with those situations.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time I was involved with training for clergy I made a call on a 
<br>
rest home one Sunday afternoon and found the regular ward nurse in tears.  She 
<br>
realized that in some fashion she had just killed a patient. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is fairly well known among at least some clergy that when a sick 
<br>
person is totally exhausted from a long illness, particularly the elderly, that 
<br>
they hang on waiting for someone to give them permission to die.  They seem to 
<br>
have such a sense of duty to their families that they are very reluctant to lay 
<br>
down their burden although they really would like to.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This man was old, very ill and he wanted to die but he felt a duty to 
<br>
his family.  Just the same he was wore out with the pain.  He expressed his 
<br>
desire to pass on to the nurse that was talking to me.  She had tried to cheer him 
<br>
up.  He was afraid to leave his family as he felt that duty to help.  She 
<br>
made some kind of comment that it was okay, they would get by.  I guess she was 
<br>
very convincing.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She checked the patient a half hour later and he had passed on.  I know 
<br>
that he died but prefer the term &quot;passed on&quot; in this instance because it is 
<br>
descriptive of what happened.  He was sick, old and tired.  He saw that he did 
<br>
not need to continue suffering on behalf of his family and he lay down his 
<br>
burden.  They do that all the time.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, you do not prepare for this work by conducting Chemistry 
<br>
Experiments.  It is a set of knowledge few ever learn.  That day it was my job to 
<br>
explain the situation to that nurse.  To explain that he was wanting to die, he went 
<br>
of his own free will, she did not do it to him, she had given him permission 
<br>
to quit suffering and he took it.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You will find a large number of people that serve those that are ill or 
<br>
otherwise unable to get around.  Many times I was the only person that visited 
<br>
an old person all week.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure, I said a prayer for them, they seemed to respond to that with a 
<br>
little hope -- that was little enough to give them.  Many times it was just the 
<br>
visit, the sound of a human voice and the touch of a human hand they were 
<br>
looking for.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They also want to talk religion.  As a visitor I can't BS those people 
<br>
about things of which I have no proof.  I can tell them what we have been told. 
<br>
&nbsp;I can say we hope that it is true.  I can even say that I personally believe 
<br>
if I believe.  But those old heads have seen way too much of life to get 
<br>
kidded -- they will spot a false answer in an instant.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, let me wind this up.  There is an entire body of knowledge and 
<br>
theory concerning questions which science neither answers nor addresses.  I am 
<br>
entirely indifferent on one level whether someone is an atheist or believes in 
<br>
some version of the Judeo-Christian religion.  I do believe that Zen has some 
<br>
practices that will benefit people.  I haven't examined their theology.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, I get very upset if some ignoramus starts throwing out the bath 
<br>
water without checking to see what is in the bath.
<br>
Ron h.
