<p>Question One: Does anyone else on the list feel that the current communist 
<br>
Vietnamese government is a legitimate one?  Note I will not be attacking those 
<br>
who express this opinion, I am just curious how prevalent this opinion is on 
<br>
this list.  Samantha, do YOU feel the current communist government of Vietnam is 
<br>
a legitimate one?  Does anyone on this list (besides Jeff) feel as much?
<br>
<p>Answers with a question.  Is anyone silly enough to think the government is 
<br>
anything less than a cash cow for the criminal syndicate that controls it.
<br>
<p>Question Two: Jeff makes various assertions about my debating abilities, 
<br>
including claiming that many of my 'facts' are inventions of my ideology, I am 
<br>
dishonest and insulting, incoherent, I am not qualified to discuss political 
<br>
topics, undisciplined, lack effort, responsibility, and skill.  In addition, I 
<br>
have no capacity or inclination to distinguish fact from fantasy, and no logical 
<br>
coherence, and that Jeff will refrain from responding to me until I get better 
<br>
at 'thinking about such matters' With that I mind, I submit humbly to the 
<br>
list the question, do others feel this is an accurate description of my presence 
<br>
on the list.
<br>
<p>Answer, As to whether or not you occasionally fall from grace I can't say.  I 
<br>
have never noticed you doing anything that was a major transgression from the 
<br>
rules of good sportsmanship.  Most of your time is spent exposing Jeff's 
<br>
tactics.  I say that with a certain admiration for Jeff's expertise at that game 
<br>
-- he and my ex mother in law could gain employment teaching the Marine Corps 
<br>
dirty fighting.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The level of your debating skills would no doubt show an apparent (but 
<br>
not real) improvement in a debate between gentlemen.
<br>
