<p>I think some of the attributions may have been lost here,
<br>
so people should feel free to correct as necessary.

<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If your deputy is acting in a way you regard as
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not completely reasonable.  Its up to you to &quot;speak out&quot;
<br>
*if* you feel it could be the best use of your time.
<br>
My representative to congress is Jim McDermott.  He is
<br>
a physician turned politician.  Normally he would be
<br>
someone I would respect and admire but over the years
<br>
I've learned that isn't a reasonable perspective (because
<br>
he is a classic politician -- doing the things that get
<br>
themselves reelected rather than the things that may be
<br>
&quot;right&quot;.  But I live in Seattle the only probable way of
<br>
getting him out of office (due to the local perspectives)
<br>
would be to nuke the city.
<br>
<p>Since &quot;speaking out&quot; would be pointless -- the alternatives
<br>
are to relocate to someplace where speaking out would not
<br>
be pointless or to devote time and energy to activities
<br>
that do have a positive effect in other areas.  The best
<br>
I can do is support &quot;term limits&quot; when there are opportunities
<br>
to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Absurd, this is the kind of twisted ethics prevalent on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extropy board that alienates me.
</em><br>
<p>Cough.  Since I'm on the board I would probably agree with Brett that this
<br>
comment needs to be explained further. Since I'm not easily offended there
<br>
is no need to apologize (at least to me). But since Extropian principle 7
<br>
is &quot;rational thinking&quot; I would suspect that there should be *some*
<br>
&quot;adaptation&quot; to conditions as they change or evolve.  If that produces a
<br>
perception of &quot;twistedness&quot; then so be it.
<br>
<p>I know that I'm a much different person now at the age of 46
<br>
than I was at the age of 18 and fighting to avoid returning
<br>
my draft card.  Experience can change oneself!  I'll observe
<br>
briefly that we are up to &quot;Extropian Principles 3.0&quot;.  We
<br>
are adapting -- which I think is a good evolutionary process.
<br>
