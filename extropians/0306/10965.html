Of course it is correct that we do not yet know as much as we should on brain and consciousness. At the same time the point that I am trying to make is independent of a  particular mechanism of consciousness:
<br>
Question A: does the uploaded copy of person X wake up thinking and feeling that (s)he is X? Does (s)he feel continuity with X (going to sleep - waking up)?
<br>
This is a scientific question that can be answered with a simple experiment: just ask the uploaded copy of X. I assume the answer depends on the details of a uploading technology, like how much and what kind of information it is able to copy and restore. I think this technology is a few decades away at least, but it seems reasonable to think that it will be developed sooner or later.
<br>
Question B: assuming that the answer to Question A is yes (the uploaded copy feels that (s)he is X), is (s)he REALLY X?
<br>
This does not look like a scientific question, since its formulation is such that it cannot be verified or falsified. It has often happened in the history of science that non-falsifiable questions have been found meaningless, e.g. which one is the correct frame of reference. If two things look the same, past scientific experience suggests that they are the same.
<br>
Of course we still tend to feel uneasy: when it comes to survival, everyone is the Most Selfish Individual. We cannot help thinking that Question B matters very much.
<br>
The answer that I choose is: it does not matter. I can accept as a continuation of my current identity any conscious being who thinks that he is a continuation of my current identity. I could not go to sleep if I could not accept this.
<br>
<p>Brett:
<br>
<em>&gt; Because I don't *know* enough about how my consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and the experience of self-hood manifests to assume that it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; persist completely decoupled from a matter substrate for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; length of time. My current thinking is no substrate means no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conscious processing (or unconscious processing either). No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consciousness process means no self concept process. In short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I assume that no brain means a discontinuation of me because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seems prudent to do so.
