</em><br>
<p>Yes, I did some study after making the acquaintance of a person with what's 
<br>
probably advanced Duchenne or Becker MD (mscular dystrophy), and the 
<br>
dystrophin molecule is gigantic--400 Kd, with at least three distinct 
<br>
regions: a part that binds actinin, a part that seems to serve as a 
<br>
cytoskeleton scaffolding, and a third part called the C-terminal domain, 
<br>
which when truncated causes clinical symptoms. This suggests that a 
<br>
smaller-genomic approach to repair or replace the C-terminal domain might 
<br>
help to tread MD. The last I heard, however, nobody knows what dystrophin 
<br>
actually &quot;does when it's at home.&quot;
<br>
<p>Hard to know how many more of those sorts of things there are in here, or 
<br>
which of them will decompose neatly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Most of the complexity seems to be coming from alternate splicing.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A report I recently read suggested that in higher organisms
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (e.g. humans) there may be an average of 3 proteins coming
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from each gene.  That is a *lot* considering that for many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genes probably only one protein is produced.  It is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to make working out the proteomics a bear of a problem.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I am only an egg.&quot; By &quot;alternate splicing&quot;, do you mean anything like RNA 
<br>
autoenzymatic activity?
<br>
<p>Yes, the dated but heroic &quot;Cartoon History of Genetics&quot; by Larry Gonick 
<br>
needs some serious updating. &quot;One Gene, One Protein&quot; was a kind of 
<br>
Copernican insight, but is turning out to be too simple a story.
