<em>&gt;&gt; Live on Tuesday's ECTV's 'Radio Hour', my guest Dr. Tom VanFlandren hit
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; us with an unexpected surprise. While discussing the inter-planetary
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; play of asteroid's, comets, and minor planets, Dr. VanFlandren disclosed
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; his ground breaking research with regard to the 'speed of gravity'.

<p>&nbsp;The Speed of Gravity - What the Experiments Say

<br>
<p>&nbsp;Abstract
<br>
&nbsp;Standard experimental techniques exist to determine the propagation speed
<br>
of forces. When we apply these techniques to gravity, they all yield
<br>
propagation speeds too great to measure, substantially faster than
<br>
lightspeed. This is because gravity, in contrast to light, has no
<br>
detectable aberration or propagation delay for its action, even for cases
<br>
(such as binary pulsars) where sources of gravity accelerate significantly
<br>
during the light time from source to target By contrast, the finite
<br>
propagation speed of light causes radiation pressure forces to have a
<br>
non-radial component causing orbits to decay (the &quot;Poynting-Robertson
<br>
effect&quot;); but gravity has no counterpart force proportional to v/c to first
<br>
order. General relativity (GR) explains these features by suggesting that
<br>
gravitation (unlike electromagnetic forces) is a pure geometric effect of
<br>
curved space-time, not a force of nature that propagates. Gravitational
<br>
radiation, which surely does propagate at lightspeed but is a fifth order
<br>
effect in v/c, is too small to play a role in explaining this difference in
<br>
behavior between gravity and ordinary forces of nature. Problems with the
<br>
causality principle also exist for GR in this connection, such as
<br>
explaining how the external fields between binary black holes manage to
<br>
continually update without benefit of communication with the masses hidden
<br>
behind event horizons. These causality problems would be solved without any
<br>
change to the mathematical formalism of GR, but only to its interpretation,
<br>
if gravity is once again taken to be a propagating force of nature in flat
<br>
spacetime with the propagation speed indicated by observational evidence
<br>
and experiments: not less than 2 x 10^10 c. Such a change of perspective
<br>
requires no change in the assumed character of gravitational radiation or
<br>
its lightspeed propagation. Although faster-than-light force propagation
<br>
speeds do violate Einstein special relativity (SR), they are in accord with
<br>
Lorentzian relativity, which has never been experimentally distinguished
<br>
from SR-at least, not if favor of SR. Indeed, far from upsetting much of
<br>
current physics, the main changes induced by this new perspective are
<br>
beneficial to areas where physics has been struggling, such as explaining
<br>
experimental evidence for non-locality in quantum physics, the dark matter
<br>
issue in cosmology, and the possible unification of forces. Recognition of
<br>
a faster-than-lightspeed propagation of gravity, as indicated by all
<br>
existing experimental evidence, may be the key to taking conventional
<br>
physics to the next plateau.
