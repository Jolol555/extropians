<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt;There's documented proof all over the place of Israeli's human rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;violations
</em><br>
<p><em>        &gt;&gt;Me:
</em><br>
<em>        &gt; &gt; Sure there is, big deal.
</em><br>
<p><em>  &gt; &quot;Samantha Atkins&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Iraq%20war%20was%20extropian?%20Re:%20[Iraq]%20The%20real%20reason%20for%20the%20war">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;
</em><br>
<p><em>  &gt; Big Deal??!!!
</em><br>
<p>Correct, big deal.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;This is the most cynical uncaring thing you could possibly say.
</em><br>
<p>Mr. Grant proposed a hypothesis to explain the extraordinary volcanic anger
<br>
in virtually every Islamic community on Earth, a rage so great they hate us
<br>
more than they love life, he said it was caused by a few small scale run of
<br>
the mill atrocities, the sort of thing that, unfortunately, you see every
<br>
day on this troubled planet. I thought the hypothesis was ridiculous then
<br>
and I still do. An extraordinary effect needs a extraordinary cause and
<br>
Mr. Grant did not provide one.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;One of the major justifciations for the invasion of  Iraq and outster of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Saddam was his human rights violations and violations of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;UN sanctions.  Israel has many times as many UN sanction violations
</em><br>
<p>I don't know it it's true that Israel has had many times as many UN human
<br>
rights violations as Saddam's Iraq but if it is it speaks volumes about the
<br>
mind numbing incompetence of the UN; but what else would you expect from an
<br>
organization that thinks the best country to chair its human rights
<br>
commission is Libya?
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; What would you feel but rage when your people are oppressed for 50
</em><br>
<em>    &gt;years or a subset of your people are so oppressed
</em><br>
<p>Lets see, if I were a Moslem man in Indonesia or Malaysia or The Philippines
<br>
and was dirt poor, uneducated and commanded by a venal corrupt government
<br>
how would I feel about the oppression of a tiny group of people 10,000 miles
<br>
away that I have never see by another group of people that I have also never
<br>
seen? Well, my primary reaction would be of boredom, yet you claim this is
<br>
the reason they're in a suicidal murderous frenzy just as the Arabs are.
<br>
Baloney.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;You also  need to stop blaming the entire Arab/Muslim world for one
</em><br>
<em>   &gt;terrorist incident.
</em><br>
<p>Apart from that Mrs. Lincoln how did you like the play?
