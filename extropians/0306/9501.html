<em>&gt;    &gt;The Taliban probably new nothing about the  9/11 attack.  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;The training
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;facilities in Afghanistan were irrelevant  to it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Then why did the majority (probably all) of the 911 hijackers 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visit Afghanistan before the big day?
</em><br>
<p>The real question is, would their task have been significantly harder
<br>
without the facilities in Afghanistan?  I doubt it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; Friedman is wrong about the role of states in terrorism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Totalitarian states know what's going on inside their borders 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or they would no be able to do the thing they want above 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything else, retain power. 
</em><br>
<p>Totalitarian states would love to be able to do that.  And indeed,
<br>
when the major threats to your regime have to involve thousands of
<br>
people, it's pretty easy to keep tabs on them.  When it's 20 people,
<br>
it's harder.  If it takes just 3 people to commit atrocities, it's
<br>
harder yet. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If these states are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; actively supporting terrorism they do nothing to stop it;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the USA has recently shown that behavior of that sort will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not contribute to the long term health of your regime. 
</em><br>
<p>Umm, pardon?  Iraq wasn't a substantially terror-supporting state.
<br>
The Iraq - Al Queda link was always wishful thinking.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;The US attack on Iraq has probably increased the number of such
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; angry muslim men willing to die if they can take some Americans
</em><br>
<em>&gt;   &gt; with them.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'm not impressed, so Muslims are angry, so what else is new? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Being angry is what Muslims do, it's the only thing they're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good at, it's just a fact of life that has nothing to do with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bad behavior by the target of that anger. To put it another 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; way, if you're kind to a terrorist he will not be kind to you. 
</em><br>
<p>John, would you be so blasé if every person in the world had a global
<br>
destruct button they could push?  What if everyone had a &quot;kill one
<br>
million people I don't like&quot; button?  Because that's the direction the
<br>
world is heading in.  
<br>
<p>It's easy to dismiss people's motivations when they're powerless to
<br>
harm you.  But the long term trend is for an increasing ability of
<br>
individuals or small groups to kill large numbers of other people.
<br>
And I'm not talking about thousands, like in the 9/11 attack.  I'm
<br>
talking about hundreds of thousands, millions, or more.
<br>
<p>It won't take state support to do this.  You could pull off much worse
<br>
attacks than 9/11 with no state support.  All it takes is highly
<br>
motivated individuals.  I suggest that the US take actions to reduce
<br>
rather than increase the supply of such individuals.
