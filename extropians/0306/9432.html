<p><em>&gt;       So what you have really given us is the work of Barnard Weiner, a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;social psychologist in California that according to the Google search I did is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;writer of so called political analysis attacking the US.
</em><br>
<p>Ron,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;what I find interesting is that you label this writer as &quot;attacking the
<br>
US&quot;. (I'm assuming that this Bernard is American, as it seems).
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, how can an US citizen &quot;attack the US&quot; with his writings? He is not
<br>
less US than the people he is attacking. If what you write is true, this
<br>
is a piece of the US criticizing another piece of the US. But then this is
<br>
not attacking, it's just an aspect of politics.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So, instead of saying &quot;attacking the US&quot;, it would be more correct to
<br>
say &quot;attacking the current US internal (and/or) foreign policy&quot;. It may
<br>
seems nitpicking, but I think it reflects a deeper issue of
<br>
identification. When one begins to think about political opponents as
<br>
&quot;attacking my country&quot;, he puts them at the same level as actual enemies
<br>
and it becomes easier to just ignore everything they say.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;When some opponent criticize, even harshily, the current Italian
<br>
government no one thinks that he is &quot;attacking Italy&quot;. He's just against
<br>
the current administration/policy. I am for example totally against it :-)
<br>
and rejoiced when in recent (minor) elections their party lost more than
<br>
20% of their votes. Am I against my country?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course you can answer that 80%+ americans support Bush-style foreign
<br>
politics. But then, you are still labelling 20% of americans as against
<br>
themselves.
<br>
<p>Ciao,
<br>
Alfio
