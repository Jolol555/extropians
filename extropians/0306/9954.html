</em><br>
<em>&gt; patriots on this list, in fact most are anti government, it's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just that after 911 it became clear that there is a sub group

</em><br>
<em>&gt; they can think of to brink it about. Solving that little 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; have at least for the near term.

</em><br>
<p>You could start by fixing the stuff 9/11 was about.
<br>
-US support for Israel (financial, military) and how that relates to the
<br>
Palestinians.
<br>
-Occupation of Saudia Arabia (and some odd 140 other countries under the
<br>
guise of military bases)
<br>
-Removing american supported (and placed) dictators in the middle east
<br>
-Removing any policies in place that purposefully destabilize the region
<br>
so you can get your oil cheaper
<br>
-Don't mind &quot;fundamentalist&quot; or religious based political groups if and
<br>
when they gain power so long as
<br>
they are *democratically* elected.  If the people in that region want a
<br>
religious government, why 
<br>
shouldn't they be allowed to have one?  Just because western mentality
<br>
espouses separation of church and state
<br>
as a *THEORY* does not mean everyone else DOES or SHOULD.  As I recall,
<br>
the muslim caliphs did well under an
<br>
Islamic government.
<br>
-Educate your public that everyone not american is not immediately an
<br>
ignorant savage who thirsts for (US) blood.
<br>
-FIX YOUR MEDIA PROBLEM; a broader viewpoint than the US-centric PULP
<br>
currently being pushed would be nice.
<br>
-Stop selling weapons to anybody in the MidEast - it should be clear by
<br>
now that region is to unstable in its current configuration 
<br>
to try to turn a quick profit on somebody else's bloodshed is morally
<br>
wrong, and the US is currently sitting in judgement, whether or not
<br>
Its brought before the UN.
<br>
-Lastly, stop insulting the prophet mohamed (this is more of a
<br>
right-wing christian problem); 
<br>
I have yet to see a single muslim proclaim loudly,  &quot;Jesus was a
<br>
goat-buggering RAPIST!&quot;
<br>
-Generally, stay out of the middle east.
<br>
<p>Contrary to what the US Media would lead you to believe,
<br>
-Nobody cares what you (or your women) wear, talk or believe (freedom of
<br>
religion is gauranteed under the koran)
<br>
-Nobody cares that you have more money; muslims believe this world is a
<br>
blink of the eye, and are generally
<br>
&nbsp;more concerned about their afterlife and their family.
<br>
-Nobody in the middle east really cares about Americans, past charging
<br>
them 200% more for a taxi cab than somebody
<br>
in the region would pay [which is understandable given the currency
<br>
exchange rates involved and the methods and players
<br>
involved in manipulating it].
<br>
<p>OR
<br>
<p>You could continue in ignorance, generally fucking people over left and
<br>
right, and EVENTUALLY GET TAGGED.
<br>
And while I empathize your markets are down (and thus hope to bring the
<br>
economy back up through increased 
<br>
military-industrial-defense-complex spending), and that your current
<br>
public consumes some ridiculously 
<br>
disproportionate amount of world energy per capita in the form of oil
<br>
(thus necessitating trying to be super greedy
<br>
And attempting to control foreign countries),  and that you hope to
<br>
marginalize the world's developing countries labor supply with 
<br>
this ridiculous Concept of &quot;intellectual property&quot; (thought crime
<br>
anyone?), you should (as a nation of &quot;intelligent, advanced people&quot;) 
<br>
clearly be able to see that your attempts at control *will* eventually
<br>
fail.
<br>
<p>So you can try and prevent every insane wacko or group of wacko's from
<br>
eventually nailing your ass to the wall through a 
<br>
Sheer monetary expenditure and advanced technology (useless ballistic
<br>
missile defense anyone?), you will do so ONLY at grave
<br>
Cost, both in the restriction of your civil liberties (which for the
<br>
most case, are available only to those who can afford the lawyers
<br>
To navigate your byzantine law system), and increased tax-dollar
<br>
spending in the &quot;war on terror&quot; without end, thus engendering
<br>
More of the world population's hatred as you crush their &quot;terroristic&quot;
<br>
activities.
<br>
<p>Put more simply,
<br>
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.
<br>
<p>Addressing the problems caused by US foreign policy would certainly be
<br>
more effective as a preventative
<br>
Than anally raping a country and telling them they should be grateful
<br>
for your civilizing force (&quot;a beacon for democracy&quot; 
<br>
or somesuch phrase) and then proclaiming &quot;Why would someone attack us?!&quot;
<br>
with the traditional sin of ommision that has engendered
<br>
MUCH STUPIDITY FROM HUMANITY in general, by replying &quot;They must be crazy
<br>
wackos&quot;.  Honestly trying to understand 
<br>
And accommodate your opponents viewpoint generally gets you much farther
<br>
than full combat with sticks and stones (or WMD's).
<br>
<p>And if that hasn't convinced you, perhaps I should point out that there
<br>
are currently 288 million people in the US.
<br>
The rest of the worlds population is currently 6 billion.  That's
<br>
approximately 21 potential &quot;terrorists&quot; for every one
<br>
US citizen.
<br>
<p>Now play nice.
<br>
omard-out
<br>
<p>PS&gt; I am an American citizen; so don't bother with the Euro-flaming
<br>
crap, concentrate on the points.
