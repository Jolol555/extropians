From: John K Clark [mailto:<a href="mailto:jonkc@att.net?Subject=RE:%20[Iraq]%20The%20real%20reason%20for%20the%20war">jonkc@att.net</a>] 
<br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; Their anger comes from their poverty (relative to us)
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes, and they're poor relative to Japan or Korea too, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they started from zero just 50 years ago and have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; natural resources. With  all that oil the Arabs should 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be the richest people on Earth, but they blew it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; big time.
</em><br>
<p>I agree.  The reason most Arabs are poor has little to do with natural
<br>
resources and everything to do with their political, economic, and
<br>
legal systems.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; A real plan on terrorism would target these root causes by 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; spreading affluence, freedom, and opportunity. [...] it all 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; comes back to spreading democracy and affluence.  IMHO, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that should be the US's #1 priority in foreign policy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Certainly, I want freedom and affluence for everybody, but you can't
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; accomplish that by lying and telling Islam what it wants to hear, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all the idiotic decisions they've made over the last 500 years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were really good ideas. They were not. 
</em><br>
<p>Well I'm glad we want the same things.  Though let me be clear - even
<br>
if I didn't give a damn about any other human being on earth, I would
<br>
still want them to be affluent and free.  Because affluent and free
<br>
people are much less likely to cause me problems and far more likely
<br>
to help me than are poor oppressed people.  So this desire to spread
<br>
democracy and affluence need not be altruistic at all.
<br>
<p>In any case, I'm not sure where the lying or &quot;telling Islam what it
<br>
wants to hear&quot; comments in your post come from - I certainly haven't
<br>
proposed that the US do either of those things.  
<br>
<p>What I want to see from the US is:
<br>
<p>1) A shift in strategy towards the spread of democracy and capitalism.
<br>
<p>2) A focus on long-term results over short term action.
<br>
<p>3) A shift towards the use of economic and cultural forces to
<br>
accomplish the above.  Specifically, I propose US incentive foreign
<br>
aid for countries that liberalize their press, reform their legal
<br>
systems, reduce corruption, increase civil liberties, and hold free
<br>
elections.  
<br>
<p>Instead I see a US that is narrowly focused on short-term protection
<br>
of its interests, with no regard for the negative longterm effect of
<br>
the short-term methods being employed.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
