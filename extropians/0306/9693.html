</em><br>
<p>No. The c of importance is the velocity that is left invariant by all
<br>
Lorenz transformations. It just happens historically that it was first
<br>
empirically observed that light moves at the same velocity regardless of
<br>
the speed of the observer, and then the attempts to explain this
<br>
observation led to the relativity postulates (roughly, that there exists
<br>
this kind of invariant velocity and that physics looks the same in all
<br>
inertial frames). From this one can then derive testable (and indeed
<br>
tested) predictions like length contraction, time dilation and
<br>
mass-energy equivalence. E=mc^2 is a consequence of the postulates. 
<br>
<p>Now, if one tries to use a c in the calculations that is not the
<br>
invariant speed then there will be a systematic discrepancy from the
<br>
momentum and time dilation effects observed in every particle
<br>
accelerator. It could of course be that physical light moves slightly
<br>
slower than the invariant velocity (light moves slower than c in many
<br>
media, and it is a common textbook exercise to show how the relativity
<br>
equations would look if everything was filled with a refractive ether
<br>
that made it slower), but in this case the difference has to be
<br>
extremely small and cosmological constraints (see below) limit it. 
<br>
<p>If something moves faster than the invariant speed there will be 
<br>
reference frames where it moves at arbitrary speeds, including backwards 
<br>
in time. So FTL gravity waves would likely end up having the same bad 
<br>
effects on cosmology as finite speed photons, even when ignoring the 
<br>
causality issue.
<br>
<p>To sum up, special relativity has a very simple and elegant mathematical 
<br>
form. The invariant velocity c is a bit like the invariant number 1 in 
<br>
multiplication; it has to exist in the group structure of Lorenz 
<br>
transformations. It does not say anything about whether there are things 
<br>
that move at that speed or not in physics, or even whether physics obeys 
<br>
the Lorenz group. That is just experimental observations, which seem to 
<br>
fit extremely well. 
<br>
<p>[Cosmological constraints: Because if photons can move at other
<br>
velocities than the invariant velocity (if they move slowly we can
<br>
always set up a fast moving lab moving alongside to examine photons at
<br>
rest - this is actually a good Gedankenexperiment to see why
<br>
electromagnetic waves have to move at the invariant speed; you can't
<br>
have a stationary wave packet in vacuum) they would have a rest mass. 
<br>
Given the relativity equations (still valid even if light is slow) and
<br>
the observable energy E of a photon at speed v we get:
<br>
<p>m_0 = E^2/[v^2 c^2/(c^2-v^2) + c^4]
<br>
<p>If v is close to c and E close to the observed pc value, then m_0 will
<br>
be extremely small. Putting E=h nu (Planck's relation) into it we get a
<br>
rest mass for photons of frequency nu:
<br>
<p>m_0 = h^2 nu^2/[v^2 c^2/(c^2-v^2) + c^4]
<br>
<p>Note that for small nu m_0 becomes even smaller. 
<br>
<p>Particles with a finite rest mass m_0 will be generated in processes
<br>
above energy 2 m_0 c^2 (another experimentally observed fact). This
<br>
means that during the big bang a certain fraction of the energy ought to
<br>
have ended up as photons just as it did with neutrinos and
<br>
electron/positron pairs. But adding a rest mass completely messes up the
<br>
amount of photons at different frequencies - the spectrum would not end
<br>
up as the blackbody spectrum we all know and love, but rather look like
<br>
the other particle spectra that are predicted in cosmology. In addition,
<br>
a lot of slow photons would have been able to manifest at lower
<br>
energies, cooling down the universe and objects in it much faster than
<br>
otherwise. In fact, it would change all blackbody spectra, so I guess
<br>
the constraint isn't really cosmological but experimental - if photons
<br>
could move slower than the invariant speed we would see a very different
<br>
world. ]
