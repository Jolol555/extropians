<p><em>&gt; Of course it is correct that we do not yet know as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we should on brain and consciousness. At the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the point that I am trying to make is independent of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particular mechanism of consciousness:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Question A: does the uploaded copy of person X wake up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thinking and feeling that (s)he is X? Does (s)he feel continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with X (going to sleep - waking up)?
</em><br>
<p>Yes and yes. Assuming, as we have been, that the upload works.
<br>
<p>Indeed the test of whether the upload has worked is likely to be
<br>
does Xprime think (s)he is X and does everyone else relate to
<br>
Xprime as X.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is a scientific question that can be answered with a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experiment: just ask the uploaded copy of X. I assume the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; answer depends on the details of a uploading technology, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how much and what kind of information it is able to copy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; restore. I think this technology is a few decades away at least,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but it seems reasonable to think that it will be developed sooner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or later.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the uploading technology is unlikely to be *built* until it can 
<br>
be designed. Seems we are unlikely to be satisfied with the design
<br>
until we have a better understanding of what we take for
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; and the &quot;self&quot;. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Question B: assuming that the answer to Question A is yes (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; uploaded copy feels that (s)he is X), is (s)he REALLY X?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This does not look like a scientific question, since its formulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is such that it cannot be verified or falsified. 
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. 
<br>
<p>Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem:  There are certain propositions
<br>
that are true that cannot be proven.
<br>
<p>Do you think the consciousness of any other person you know
<br>
is a scientifically veriable hypothesis? I think it can only be inferred.
<br>
<p>Do you think your own is even to you? I think it can only be 
<br>
assumed.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Without assuming it you have *no base* from which to formulate
<br>
scientific questions or any other types of questions.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course we still tend to feel uneasy: when it comes to survival,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone is the Most Selfish Individual. We cannot help thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Question B matters very much. The answer that I choose is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it does not matter.
</em><br>
<p>A leap of faith?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I can accept as a continuation of my current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; identity any conscious being who thinks that he is a continuation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of my current identity. I could not go to sleep if I could not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept this.
</em><br>
<p>A leap of faith for peace of mind? 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Brett:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Because I don't *know* enough about how my consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and the experience of self-hood manifests to assume that it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; persist completely decoupled from a matter substrate for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; length of time. My current thinking is no substrate means no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; conscious processing (or unconscious processing either). No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; consciousness process means no self concept process. In short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I assume that no brain means a discontinuation of me because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; seems prudent to do so.
