<em>&gt; Clues:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) THE SEASON IS JUST GONE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 2) PUTTING A CIRCLE INTO A SQUARE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 3) THEY CAN GO IN FROM THE FRONT OR THE SIDE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 4) AT WORK, HOME OR TAKE AWAY
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 5) IT CAN FIT INTO TIGHT SPACES
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 6) BRING IT ANYWHERE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 7) IT&gt; '&gt; S A JOURNEY OUT AND BACK AGAIN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 8) YOU CAN USE IT ONCE , TWICE OR OVER &amp; OVER AGAIN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 9) YOU CAN FIND ME IN THE COLOURS OF THE RAINBOW
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 10) OPEN ME TO DISCOVER KNOWLEDGE
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 11) PUTTING THE BOOT IN
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What is the sound?
</em><br>
<p>I didn't get very far with this either.  It's possible that we're supposed
<br>
to answer each one separately and then take the first letters of the answer
<br>
to spell out a sound.  But most of the clues seem far too vague for unique
<br>
answers.
<br>
<p>The other possibility is that all the clues relate to the same concept.
<br>
One common element I saw had to do with circles.  Circles also manifest
<br>
as the letter O or the number 0.  It seems that a number of the clues
<br>
were related to either the letter O or to circularity in some way:
<br>
<p>1. Seasons form a circle;  Gone has an O.
<br>
<p>2. The letter O can be thought of as a circle put into a square-ish
<br>
typesetting location.  (Also I thought of a round pizza in a square box,
<br>
not sure how that fits in though!)
<br>
<p>3. Not sure; with an O you could go in the front (go through the hole),
<br>
but from the side?
<br>
<p>4. Work and Home have O's in them; &quot;take away&quot; could leave you with nothing,
<br>
a zero, which is another form of circle.
<br>
<p>5. A zero can fit into tight spaces since it is the smallest number.
<br>
<p>6. I can't make much of a connection to this one.
<br>
<p>7. A journey out and back is, conceptually, a circular journey.
<br>
<p>8. Lots of O's in this clue.  &quot;Once, twice&quot; might hint at a number.
<br>
<p>9. The wording of this one somehow suggested a typograpical clue.
<br>
Colours has two O's, as do Yellow and Violet.
<br>
<p>10. The obvious answer to this one is Book, which has two O's.
<br>
<p>11. Totally obscure, except again Boot has two O's.  The similarity
<br>
between Boot and Book is striking.
<br>
<p>And I don't really have an answer for the sound, unless it is Ohhh,
<br>
the sound you make when you &quot;get it&quot;.
<br>
