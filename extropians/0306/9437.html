<em>&gt; The &quot;salon&quot; model is perhaps the closest to what is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; ridiculed, humored, whatever.  However, they serve at
</em><br>
<em>&gt; least one useful purpose, regardless of the merits of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what they present to us: they demonstrate that there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is in fact an atmosphere of free inquiry.  Without
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that, the salon is just another fashion clique, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any credibility is purely incidental.
</em><br>
<p>This is an excellent response to my fears.  This forum is not a think-tank.
<br>
It is more of a salon as you and Anders have correctly pointed out.  My
<br>
concerns seem misdirected now.  This forum is an excellent community
<br>
gathering place, which lead me to post my VR-BAR scenario which was a
<br>
simulated spoof of myself in this community.  I have gotten so many contacts
<br>
off-line for security advice, that I am now amazed at how much actually is
<br>
going on under the covers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, some people on this list are typically
</em><br>
<em>&gt; so worried that someone might post something that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be &quot;embarrassing&quot; to extropianism that at many,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many points in the past this has served to either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stifle real free discussion, or generated a huge
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amount of heat with little light, with various threats
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - overt or implied - to exclude participants due to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the emotions their positions evoked.  This response
</em><br>
<em>&gt; itself tends to DIScredit any credibility of the list.
</em><br>
<p>This is definitely a concern, and not unique to this list.  However, we do
<br>
need to figure out a way for participants to discuss even the &quot;difficult
<br>
questions&quot; with less heat and more light.  I think most of the complaints
<br>
about certain topics is due to their lack of signal-to-noise ratio, not that
<br>
the topics are disallowed.  We also need to figure out how to allow these
<br>
discussions to occur without overwhelming other topics.  Certain threads
<br>
seem to explode into such volume that no other communication is possible.
<br>
It becomes a denial-of-service effect where even unrelated conversations
<br>
become more difficult.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The only proper response - assuming that one considers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the forum to worth preserving - is to demonstrate the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; impotence of such threats by being even more obnoxious
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and outrageous, even if one is disinclined to be so by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nature.  Then, if that does not result in banishment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or censorship, we can feel reasonably assured that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forum is still free.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think we need to be more obnoxious, because many of us have no
<br>
trouble in this area.  Maybe being more outrageous would be helpful.
<br>
However, despite your concerns, I don't think there is really any censorship
<br>
or danger that this forum is not free.  There are too many freedom-loving
<br>
individuals on all points of the political spectrum who would never allow
<br>
that to happen.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I would suggest, therefore, that everyone attending
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this salon of, for and by the future take it upon
</em><br>
<em>&gt; themselves to make at least one truly outrageous post
</em><br>
<em>&gt; every month or so, just as an ongoing test and proof
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to those who might feel that at least a chilling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; effect was present, and an encouragement to those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; people who have genuinely good ideas but who cringe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from facing the social embarrassment or ostracism, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; snide remarks, etc. that always emerge from those who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; haven't anything good to add.
</em><br>
<p>Fear of embarrassment is a great inhibitor.  Fortunately, I do not fear
<br>
embarrassment and tend to embarrass myself often in this forum.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the list is supposed to be an advertisement for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropianism, with everyone lined up in their suits
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and flowered dresses, scrubbed clean and then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; airbrushed after the fact, then it rather defeats the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purpose anyway.  No real extropian would want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; participate in that kind of farce.
</em><br>
<p>I believe that this is partially aimed at me.  Although it accurately
<br>
reflects some of my concerns, it leads to a Stepford-Borg horror that I
<br>
never intended.  Luckily, nobody listens to me when I have stupid ideas.  I
<br>
don't see much danger in people on this list bowing too much to peer
<br>
pressure.  We have Jupiter-sized egos that won't allow that.  (Why did
<br>
Jupiter-egos evolve faster than Jupiter-brains?)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If it's about a forum for ideas, a free-for-all for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the people who are in the business of trying new
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things and exploring new and radically different
</em><br>
<em>&gt; approaches, which it often is, then forget those
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suits.  Bring wrenches, crowbars and intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bulldozers.  Dress for the day: flak jackets and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jeans.
</em><br>
<p>Cool!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There should be and are specific discussion groups
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that limit membership and control submissions.  There
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is nothing wrong with that in a group of experts in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; field who are pursueing narrowly defined interests
</em><br>
<em>&gt; within a precise protocol.
</em><br>
<p>I am brainstorming ideas on how an expert, think-tank, consensus,
<br>
development, work-group online system might function to make communications
<br>
and ideas progress more efficiently than an e-mail list allows.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Extropy, however, is NOT a narrowly defined interest,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and by its nature is likely to generate an infinite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; variety of chaotic nodes.  That doesn't mean that a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of posts frankly stink.  It happens, and we should
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point that out.  SO WHAT?  If someone really annoys
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you, don't read him or her, or, if it pleases you,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jump all over their case, refute everything,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; demonstrate that they are morons, make them eat their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; words, revel in it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Just don't kill the salon because someone says
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something you don't like.  Grow up.
</em><br>
<p>AGREED!  This seems to be a complete and accurate refutation of &quot;my fears&quot;
<br>
that I posted.  I vote for this as post of the month!  (Thanks to everybody
<br>
who participated!)
