<p>Good. You are thinking correctly here. You can use one set to &quot;curve-fit&quot;
<br>
the data, and another set to test your curve-fit to determine whether it
<br>
persists through time. No real need for a third set of data. It is important
<br>
that your test be for statistical significance rather than only for
<br>
profit/loss. If you don't know stat then you should learn it. The basic
<br>
tests are not too complicated. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Fun, that You mention gambling (on the wrong side of the

</em><br>
<p>In the early 80's I made my living counting cards at the blackjack tables in
<br>
Reno and Las Vegas. I played cards for an entire year, seven days per week.
<br>
It was my business. In fact I decided to become an investment advisor while
<br>
sitting at a blackjack table in Reno. I was ahead for the night by about
<br>
$5,000. The dealer asked me what I would do with my winnings if I were to
<br>
win $50,000. I said, &quot;Well, I guess I would invest it in the stockmarket.&quot;
<br>
The dealer asked if I knew anything about the market. I answered, &quot;No, not
<br>
really, but now that you mention it I really think I should learn about the
<br>
stockmarket. I think I would be good at it.&quot;  I went home and started
<br>
studying to get my series 7 general securities broker license. The rest is
<br>
history. I was a broker for 12 years.
<br>
<p>Blackjack is the only beatable game in the casino, so don't waste your time
<br>
trying to find gambling systems for other games. Even blackjack is difficult
<br>
now as the casinos have become wise to card-counting. Even back then, 20
<br>
years ago, I was barred from playing cards in six casinos. The casino bosses
<br>
would tap me on the shoulder and say &quot;Excuse me, sir, but we have decided
<br>
that we no longer wish to have you as a blackjack customer. You're welcome
<br>
to play slots or craps or any other game but blackjack.&quot; They're even
<br>
tougher now than they were then. In fact it is almost impossible now even to
<br>
find a beatable game; the pit bosses and some of the dealers are trained in
<br>
card-counting so they can detect it more easily and evict the counters
<br>
before they make any money. They also shuffle early and use other tactics to
<br>
thwart the counters.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned my statistical project these days is horse racing. I read an
<br>
interesting research report in a statistics journal about an apparent
<br>
inefficiency in paramutual betting at the track: it seems that the most
<br>
boring and conservative bets, (show bets on heavy favorites), have bigger
<br>
pay-offs than they should have in an efficient market for bets. The
<br>
statistics suggest that novices tend to bet on long shots for the sheer
<br>
thrill and entertainment value, creating an opportunity for professionals to
<br>
make a profit on the favorites.
