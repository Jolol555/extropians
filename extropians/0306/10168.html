<br>
<p><em>	 &gt; It [911] brought out the current policies to light, didn't
</em><br>
it?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you think 911 will ever lead the American people to demand
<br>
their government have a more sympathetic policy toward Palestine then
<br>
you must be smoking some very funny cigarettes.
<br>
<p>Me: I suppose we'll see, eh?  Certes, it certainly got the Bush
<br>
administration to draw up a road map to peace rather quickly.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;There's documented proof all over the place of Israeli's human
</em><br>
rights
<br>
<em>   &gt;violations
</em><br>
<p>Sure there is, big deal. The world is full of injustice and every people
<br>
has had bad things happen to them and Palestinians are no exception, but
<br>
if you want to explain the unprecedented volcanic rage consuming the
<br>
entire Islamic world from Algeria to Indonesia you're going to have to
<br>
come up with some unprecedented horror inflicted on all of Islam (not
<br>
just the tiny percentage that is Palestinian) the likes of which no
<br>
other people have ever experienced in the history of the world; and
<br>
after that you need to explain why Jews don't crash airliners into
<br>
German skyscrapers.
<br>
<p>Me: Perhaps muslims are simply fed up with the situation and willing to
<br>
do something about it.
<br>
And in regards to Jews, you've just acknowledged they're killing people
<br>
on a regular basis.
<br>
Doing it piecemeal doesn't make it any less horrifying than doing it all
<br>
at once :)
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; Islam is a brotherhood, and ALL muslims are troubled when
</em><br>
<em>    &gt; one of them is attacked.
</em><br>
<p>Brotherhood? Muslims have killed far more Muslims than the West could
<br>
ever dream of doing.
<br>
<p>Me: Same could be said of Christianity :)  Even more to the point, its
<br>
generally politics that gets
<br>
people killed, not religions... religions are just the moral qualifier.
<br>
I have yet to see a religion,
<br>
for instance, that endorses psychopathy.
<br>
<p><em>    &gt; So then let them democratically elect their brainless thugs than
</em><br>
<p>Let them? Islam has no history of democracy, it's not in their culture,
<br>
even today Turkey is the only country that comes close, but if they want
<br>
to turn democratic that's fine with me. However even if they have a vote
<br>
and decide that all Americans should die I'm still not going down
<br>
without a fight. You mention democracy a lot, you seem to think it will
<br>
solve all the world's problems, it's kinda cute.
<br>
<p>Me: I think it will satisfy them; and thats what its all about eh? 
<br>
Compromise.  Achieving a win-win situation.
<br>
<p><em>   &gt;But ya did get your ass spanked in Vietnam
</em><br>
True, but judging from what happened in Afghanistan and Iraq it doesn't
<br>
look like that's going to happen again anytime soon. Muslims make lousy
<br>
soldiers, especially Arabs.
<br>
<p>Me: Take a look at history, whats goes around, comes around.  And the
<br>
lesson you should have learned from Vietnam (imho), 
<br>
my fine-feathered friend, is that guerilla warfare with extremely
<br>
motivated troops can overcome any technology based advantages.
<br>
Just ask the French :)
<br>
<p><em>     &gt;you support Israel
</em><br>
<p>You have a simplistic black and white attitude, the Arabs are the good
<br>
guys and Israel is the bad guy. I think they're both bad, the only
<br>
difference is one crashes airliners into American skyscrapers and one
<br>
does not.
<br>
<p>Me: Israel the state is the bad guy in my world picture; and while I may
<br>
not care for the average 
<br>
Israeli's airs of superiority, I do acknowledge they have a right to
<br>
live there.  Just not in its current 
<br>
configuration (1948+).  Sorry.  The state of Israel is simply too
<br>
destablizing to the region.  Whats truely 
<br>
ironic is that there were Jews in Palestine living side-by-side with
<br>
Palestinians quite nicely prior to the 
<br>
foundation of Israel by Britain and the UN.  Since its establishment,
<br>
there have been countless wars in 
<br>
the region.  Pretty much (in my opinion) the only thing propping up
<br>
Israel is (previous and current) 
<br>
US military and financial aid.
<br>
<p>And as to simplistic black and white attitudes, well, we all have are
<br>
opinions :)
<br>
<p>omard-out 
<br>
<p>PS&gt; I'm sorry I won't be able to respond if you feel a further need to
<br>
respond; 
<br>
I will be traveling shortly, and my internet connectivity (or rather,
<br>
ability to respond) 
<br>
will be very much non-existent.  If you would like, I would be happy to
<br>
continue to answer 
<br>
any questions you may have offlist, but the
<br>
answers/responses/conversation  will be at 
<br>
least a month in coming.  Obviously feel free to discuss amongst
<br>
yourselves :)
