<p><em>&gt; First, are insider trading laws about what is widely known

</em><br>
<p>To give you an example: let us say you observe that almost every time a
<br>
stock gets highlighted in the investment column of some business magazine,
<br>
the stock jumps in price on the day the magazine hits the news-stands. You
<br>
know someone who works at the company that prints the magazine, so you call
<br>
him and ask him to tell you the name of the company that will appear in the
<br>
column, before the magazine hits the news-stands, so that you can buy the
<br>
stock and profit from the positive publicity on the day the magazine hits
<br>
the stands. This strategy is illegal in the USA. 
<br>
<p>But have you really taken possession of &quot;inside information&quot; about the
<br>
company? Not really. You've just found a clever way to predict the demand
<br>
for the stock. It will be something to brag about while you're in prison.
<br>
<p>This strategy above has been tried, by the way.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Scientist figure out things other people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not know with information that is widely available to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everyone.  It seems like one could also figure out which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; companies are over or under valued by the market given sufficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; diligence. 
</em><br>
<p>One would think so. But when real scientists (not the pseudoscientists of
<br>
Wall Street) applied good science to the market they discovered that the
<br>
current market price of a stock reflects the best estimate of the company's
<br>
value on any given day, and that to the extent that the current price may be
<br>
in error, there was no evidence that any non-insider participants in the
<br>
market are able to capitalize on such errors consistently.
