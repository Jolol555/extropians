Quorum of 50 countries vote to allow rejection of GM

foods without proof they pose any danger.

&nbsp;UN food treaty on GM food regulation to get effective soon

<p>&quot;The United States and the European Union have been in a
<br>
dispute over genetically modified products, and the
<br>
disagreement has stalled the current round of WTO trade
<br>
talks.
<br>
<p>16/06/2003 A United Nations treaty regulating the trade
<br>
of genetically modified products will soon go into effect,
<br>
after gaining the approval of a 50th U.N. member.
<br>
<p>The Pacific nation Palau ratified the controversial treaty,
<br>
known as the Cartegena Protocol on Biosafety, Friday.
<br>
Fifty nations needed to adopt the pact before it will turn
<br>
into law, 90 days from now.
<br>
<p>The U.N. Environment Program said Saturday that Palau`s
<br>
move will help make use of genetically-modified products
<br>
safer by allowing countries to reject them without proof
<br>
they pose any danger.
<br>
<p>But the agreement goes against current World Trade
<br>
Organization (WTO) rules that require countries to have
<br>
scientific proof of a risk to refuse entry of these products.
<br>
The Associated Press reports none of the major grain
<br>
producing countries has ratified the protocol, including
<br>
the United States.
<br>
<p>The United States and the European Union have been
<br>
in a dispute over genetically modified products, and the
<br>
disagreement has stalled the current round of WTO
<br>
trade talks.
<br>
<p>Genetically modified foods have had their genes changed,
<br>
usually to make them more resistant to disease or to
<br>
produce in greater quantities. Proponents say they pose
<br>
no risk and could work to alleviate poverty. Critics argue
<br>
the genetic mutations could pose health hazards and
<br>
cause havoc in the environment.
