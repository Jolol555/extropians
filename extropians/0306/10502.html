(ccing extropians too, only because this topic has appeared there before)
<br>
<p>&quot;bzr&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:bzr@csd.net?Subject=Re:%20Bayes%20vs.%20LP">bzr@csd.net</a>&gt;, Sun, 15 Jun 2003:
<br>
<p><em>&gt;However, perhaps the easiest way to see that the Bayesian framework won't do
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as a comprehensive framework for science, and why it assuredly can't proxy
</em><br>
<em>&gt;as the whole of a philosophy of science, is to consider this problem:
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;We have a penny.  We toss it.  What are the odds that we'll get heads?
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;The answer:  0
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Zero?  Yes.  This is very counterintuitive, admittedly, particularly for
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statisticians.  However, the truth is there are no &quot;odds&quot; here at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Penny tossing is deterministic.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;That being the case, if we are appraised of all the initial
</em><br>
<em>&gt;conditions of the toss, and possess a complete knowledge of the laws
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of physics, then we can predict with certainty what we will get
</em><br>
<em>&gt;(heads,or tails, or, very rarely, a coin on edge).  Even more
</em><br>
<em>&gt;interestingly (and counterintuitively), without any knowledge of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statistics OR  knowlege of physics we can be sure that, provided the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;test surface is flat, we will get heads, tails, or a coin on its
</em><br>
<em>&gt;edge.
</em><br>
<p>I think that using determinism in this way is putting up a smoke
<br>
screen in addition to missing the large picture of how scientists
<br>
intuitively do science. You have a real experiment, so it is
<br>
physical, and all propositions are testable. How do you define
<br>
determinism for this system? Your determinism is based on a model of
<br>
some physics, is it not? No matter how 'deterministic' something may
<br>
be, your prediction for the outcome of the coin toss is based on
<br>
data and a model and what other information you have about that
<br>
system. A Bayes discussion is always in the realm of epistemology,
<br>
i.e. how we know what we know.
<br>
<p>Humans never know how nature _is_. All humans can do is make an
<br>
abstract physical description of nature. Scientific studies are how
<br>
we are able to process information in order to say some things about
<br>
that nature. Bayesian concepts makes this process explicit. A
<br>
Bayesian perspective of science says that any theory about reality
<br>
can have no consequences testable by us, unless that theory can also
<br>
describe what humans can see and know. Models, data, prior
<br>
information, in other words.
<br>
<p>Note also how causality takes a side seat. A logical relationship
<br>
between the event (and their probabilities) does not imply a causal
<br>
(physical) relationship between the events. Sometimes Bayesians call
<br>
this the Mind Projection Fallacy, which is behind a huge number of
<br>
misconceptions and 'paradoxes' in mathematics (set theory,
<br>
information theory, Fourier transform,...) physics (quantum and
<br>
relativistic physics, potential, ...) philosophy (Bohr, Einstein,
<br>
Bohm, Popper, Penrose, ...).
<br>
<p>Bayes Theorem is only a multiplication rule of probability theory,
<br>
which shows a relationship between a posterior probability, a
<br>
likelihood of data to model, and prior probability. The prior
<br>
probability and posterior probability are not necessarily related in
<br>
time. These concepts show just a different relationship to the data
<br>
to be analyzed. The Bayesian methodologies approach the scientific
<br>
inference from &quot;first principles&quot;, grasping an n-parametric event
<br>
directly with an n-dimensional posterior probability distribution.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;The question of why statistical analysis &quot;works&quot; (to the extent that
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it does, and given an initial state of ignorance), or indeed the
</em><br>
<em>&gt;question of what conditions must pertain in order for statistical
</em><br>
<em>&gt;analysis to be appropriate, is not itself answerable by further
</em><br>
<em>&gt;statistical analysis.
</em><br>
<p>No.
<br>
<p>Some history. The Bayesian probabilistic ideas have been around
<br>
since the 1700s. Bernoulli, in 1713, recognized the distinction
<br>
between two definitions of probability: (1) probability as a measure
<br>
of the plausibility of an event with incomplete knowledge, and (2)
<br>
probability as the long-run frequency of occurrence of an event in a
<br>
sequence of repeated (sometimes hypothetical) experiments. The
<br>
former (1) is a general definition of probability adopted by the
<br>
Bayesians. The latter (2) is called the &quot;frequentist&quot; view,
<br>
sometimes called the &quot;classical&quot;, &quot;orthodox&quot; or &quot;sampling theory&quot;
<br>
view.
<br>
<p>Scientists who rely on frequentist definitions, while assigning
<br>
their uncertainties for their measurements, should be careful.  The
<br>
concept of sampling theory, or the statistical ensemble, in
<br>
astronomy, for example, is often not relevant.  A gamma-ray burst is
<br>
a unique event, observed once, and the astronomer needs to know what
<br>
uncertainty to place on the one data set he/she actually has, not on
<br>
thousands of other hypothetical gamma-ray burst events. And
<br>
similarly, the astronomer who needs to assign uncertainty to the
<br>
large-scale structure of the Universe needs to assign uncertainties
<br>
based on _our_ particular Universe, because there are not similar
<br>
Observations in each of the &quot;thousands of universes like our own.&quot;
<br>
<p>The version of Bayes' Theorem that statisticians use today is
<br>
actually the generalized version due to Laplace.  One particularly
<br>
nice example of Laplace's Bayesian work was his estimation of the
<br>
mass of Saturn, given orbital data from various astronomical
<br>
observatories about the mutual perturbations of Jupiter and Saturn,
<br>
and using a physical argument that Saturn's mass cannot be so small
<br>
that it would lose its rings or so large that it would disrupt the
<br>
Solar System. Laplace said, in his conclusion, that the mass of
<br>
Saturn was (1/3512) of the solar mass, and he gave a probability of
<br>
11,000 to 1 that the mass of Saturn lies within 1/100 of that value.
<br>
He should have placed a bet, because over the next 150 years, the
<br>
accumulation of data changed his estimate for the mass of Saturn by
<br>
only 0.63% ...
