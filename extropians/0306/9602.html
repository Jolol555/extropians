Those who read the Friedman article might also wish to take a gander at 
<br>
Llewellyn Rockwell's article _One Big Thing Wrong_ at 
<br>
<a href="http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=1245">http://www.mises.org/fullstory.asp?control=1245</a> , written in direct 
<br>
response.
<br>
<p>Rockwell states, on Freidman, &lt;&lt;He begins with the question concerning 
<br>
the entire Muslim world after 9–11: why do they hate us? And after the 
<br>
most recent war, the question has broadened into: why does everybody 
<br>
else hate us? By now everyone knows these questions, but little thought 
<br>
is put into the phrasing of the question, namely, who exactly is &quot;us.&quot;
<br>
<p>Am I supposed to believe that the average Muslim hates me and you as 
<br>
much as they hate Richard Cheney, George Bush, and Donald Rumsfeld? The 
<br>
fact is that Muslims don't hate me or you. They don't know me or you. 
<br>
But they do know the names of people at the top of the U.S. government, 
<br>
and for good reason: these people have ordered the military occupation 
<br>
of Muslim countries. We did not order this; they did, and the citizens 
<br>
of these countries hate them for it. To conglomerate me and you with 
<br>
Dick, George, and Donald is to engage in a very slippery rhetorical tactic.
<br>
<p>[...]
<br>
<p>What is Friedman's error? In a phrase, he conflates Power and Market (to 
<br>
borrow a phrase from the title of Murray Rothbard's great book). In 
<br>
missing this point, Friedman shows that he has done too much reporting 
<br>
and not enough thinking. He sees angry people all over the world, from 
<br>
Muslims in a rage over U.S. troops and U.S. movies, to the French 
<br>
bourgeoisie, attacking McDonald's, and draws the most trivial conclusion 
<br>
possible: people always hate the dominant power. He makes no sharp 
<br>
distinction between econo-cultural influence and politico-military 
<br>
imperialism, whereas any serious understanding of the world must begin 
<br>
with this distinction.
<br>
<p>What is the difference between econo-cultural influence and 
<br>
politico-military imperialism? It begins with the elementary divide 
<br>
between things that people choose to embrace and those that are foisted 
<br>
upon them. American commerce is not dominant around the world because 
<br>
people are buying products at the point of a gun. Consumers of the world 
<br>
have chosen, of their own free will, to purchase these goods offered by 
<br>
entrepreneurial companies.&gt;&gt;

<p>The tricky thing here being who is defined by 'terrorist' and 'us'. I 
<br>
can't help but thinking that 'us' in this case is those who would 
<br>
eagerly use coercion on their fellow citizen to make him cough up the 
<br>
tax dollars to pay for unilateral wars of aggression. I'm hoping I'm 
<br>
correct when I suggest the intersection of this 'us' and extropianism 
<br>
should be nonexistant.
<br>
<p>I've seen pro-war demonstrators with signs saying 'protestor=terrorist'. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I'll bet these pro-war folks were part of Ron's 'us' group.
