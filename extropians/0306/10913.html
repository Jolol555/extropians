Oh, hasty judgement! ...have you ever _had_ PTSD?    :  )
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Not that I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;saying guilt is a good thing but rather that getting done with it is an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;important part of growth and self-responsibility.   
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
It's not removing guilt, it's removing _the ability to feel guilt_. In 
<br>
my opinion 'guilt' is a symptom of mental disorder due to malfunction. 
<br>
There is no reason for an intelligent, neurologically healthy person to 
<br>
ever feel it. If they have done nothing deliberately that they know to 
<br>
be bad, what is there to feel guilty about? Mistakes should not invoke 
<br>
guilt; mistakes happen to everybody and we all know that and accept it. 
<br>
And if someone is being an a-hole on purpose, they're unlikely to feel 
<br>
guilty, because they're an a-hole...
<br>
Where does that leave a place for guilt, apart from filling you full of 
<br>
hormones that make you sick and shortening your lifespan?
<br>
Also, let's not mislead people... TMS is not surgery...d'you think we 
<br>
should change the subject title?
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It has nothing to do with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;religion to disapprove of such misuse of technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Yes I agree. However, wiping 'guilt' is not, for me, a misuse of 
<br>
technology but part of the cure for a malfunction, so perhaps it is 
<br>
hasty to use the word 'misuse'? ... a lot of people think stem-cell 
<br>
cloning is 'misuse'...you know what I mean?
<br>
<p>[re: guilt]
<br>
No, it doesn't.  Not if it is dealt with intelligently. 
<br>
<p><p>...That's why I asked about the PTSD...ever-increasing guilt about your 
<br>
inability to cope, and your inability to stop experiencing horrid things 
<br>
against your will, can utterly destroy your life...Please take a fair 
<br>
look at what is really going on before condemnation, as I feel you may 
<br>
have missed many of the potential benefits of this technique in 
<br>
focussing on a possibility of misuse? I could be wrong, and you may come 
<br>
back to me having found out much more and still think it's bad news, 
<br>
which is your prerogative, obviously...and it is certainly a very good 
<br>
idea to try to prevent genuine misuse (ie, without informed consent)... 
<br>
But I fear perhaps casually using words like 'butchery' is a bit unjust, 
<br>
considering all the people who have been helped by this, including 
<br>
myself, who are very grateful for it, I can tell you.
<br>
I hope you don't find this offensive; I am just asking that we be 
<br>
careful of mistaking rumor (or even amusing stories  :  ) ) for the 
<br>
facts, as this is quite important to me.
<br>
Best,
<br>
Ramonsky
