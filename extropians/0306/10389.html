<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;&lt;The nation's leading environmental groups can barely control their enthusiasm. ''We're bullish on wind,'' says Kert Davies, research director of Greenpeace USA. ''Everybody has to ante up in the fight.''  ... 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, this is a new day.  I and the director of Greenpeace agree on something.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Robert had an objection that I kinda punted: that his detroit doesn't run
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;on electricity.  My notion is that a transition would be gradual enough
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that major pain would be averted.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;So now I ask, if the current low interest rates hold and wind power keeps
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;going in at the current rate (they are building them like hell out here), we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;know who the winners are.  But who loses?  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to ignore for the time being those who hold stock in the alternatives.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone mentioned climate change downwind of the windmills.  What is 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;that?  I haven't heard of anything like that, altho it stands to reason if we are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;extracting energy from the wind, the entropy of the wind must somehow
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;increase.  Anyone know?  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived in the southern taxifornia desert for several years.  Some times of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;the year the wind howls thru there with such force and consistency, that
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;death would be a sweet relief.  Any change in that weather pattern as a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;result of windmills would have to be for the better.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;The bird people don't like the idea.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see where pilots might not like the idea, since they would face
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;additional danger should their engine quit over a vast wind farm.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been claims that windmills are noisy.  I often ride up to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Altamont Pass near here and pull over on a breezy day.  The windmills
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;do make some noise, but not that much.  If one is a km away, one 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;cannot hear them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Some have said that a hilltop covered with windmills is unsightly, but
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;I beg to differ.  I find them very sightly.  On a windy day when they are
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;all spinning like hell, generating all that power and all that beautiful
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;money, they are quite scenic. 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;OK, so I know who wins, but who loses (besides the bird fans and pilots) 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;if we start poking windmills into the ground like weeds?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;----
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;On the bird objection surely some sort of technological
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;scarecrow&quot; could be produced. On the plane thing
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;having either no fly zone or &quot;service roads&quot; (doubling as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;landing spots of last resort) for those who absolutely 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;positively have to fly over a wind farm &quot;because its there&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;might reduce the risk to planes. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess the intuitive losers have to be the current suppliers
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;of electricity with their investments in alternative generating
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;plant and equipment. The final product electricity is a pretty
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;basic commodity. Delivered onto a grid its pretty hard to 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;buy green electricity at a higher price. So the main problem
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;would seem to be the &quot;cost of entry&quot;. The windmills would
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;have to be more efficient costwise not cleaner. Unless a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;tax was placed on less clean production methods. 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Regards
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Brett
