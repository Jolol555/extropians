<em>&gt; Well, I do wish that Paul Grant was here to defend himself,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Read the post carefully.  Paul Grant is not supporting Saddam, nor even 
<br>
defending Saddam.  He is pointing out that neither Saddam nor, for that 
<br>
matter, Bush, are exceptional from a realpolitik view of world history.  I 
<br>
do not share that view of world history.  I do not think that Saddam's 
<br>
actions are excused by the fact that many worse dictators have existed in 
<br>
history who have invaded on flimsier pretexts; the historical precedent is 
<br>
to me irrelevant one way or the other.  Similarly, I do not think that 
<br>
Bush's actions are excused by the fact that many political leaders have 
<br>
done much worse things.  Paul Grant, though, is simply stepping back and 
<br>
viewing the situation as a realpolitik-oriented historian might view it 
<br>
had it occurred a hundred years ago.
<br>
<p>People in the grip of blind patriotism who will go to any lengths, however 
<br>
irrational, to exalt Bush and vilify Iraq, will exaggerate the genuine 
<br>
difference that exists between the two, even though there is a genuine 
<br>
difference.  No matter how evil Saddam is, it will always be possible to 
<br>
paint a picture of him that is even more evil than the reality.  A 
<br>
scrupulous arguer must then attempt to dispel this picture, and, I 
<br>
suppose, be accused of &quot;defending&quot; Saddam.  Of course it may well be that 
<br>
Paul Grant, in the heat of bipolarized argument, went too far in arguing 
<br>
and tipped the scales the other way.  This should not be interpreted as 
<br>
any particular liking or support for Saddam, which is of course extremely 
<br>
unlikely in terms of prior odds.  It is a consequence of polarized debate, 
<br>
in which both sides tend to go too far on whatever argument they are 
<br>
currently advancing.  This is human nature and hence highly likely as an 
<br>
explanation.
