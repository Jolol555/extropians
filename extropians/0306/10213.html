Gts,
<br>
<p>I haven't been following all of this thread but I'd be interested to hear
<br>
what you point view on Warren Buffet would be.
<br>
<p>According to a book &quot;The Essays of Waren Buffet: Lessons for Investors and
<br>
Managers&quot; by Lawrence Cunningham. Over 45 years Warren Buffet compounded the
<br>
$10,000 he saved through school and college into a holding in Berkshire
<br>
Hathaway worth approximately one million times his original capital.
<br>
<p>I can  appreciate that like lotto winner (someone will win or outperform by
<br>
chance alone) and human nature being what it is many will be inclined to
<br>
think that somethink other than luck played a part but do you really think
<br>
the Warren Buffet's success is a mere statistical phenomenom. It could have
<br>
been anyone and just happened to be him?
<br>
<p>Is this you contention?  In fairness it would seem that the bias against the
<br>
view that such strategies could exist might appeal to one that has not
<br>
stumbled across a particular strategy as well. So I guess the fair question
<br>
is
<br>
in what way are the alternate hypothesis falsifiable? How could you rule out
<br>
all strategies rather than merely those that you may have tried?
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
Brett Paatsch
<br>
<p>Aside: I am often mildly amused at the statements of people who by bizzare
<br>
acident find themselves
<br>
sitting up in hospitals describing themselves as very lucky because they
<br>
narrowly avoided a still worst fate. Given that lightening has struck one, I
<br>
guess one is lucky not to die. But how many people got struck by lightening
<br>
on that particular day. The doctors usually chime, in cheerfully, that the
<br>
patient is in satisfactory condition. I guess some people have lower
<br>
thresholds of being lucky and in a satisfactory conditon than I do.
