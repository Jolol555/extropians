<p>
According to the efficient market theory, there are really no such things
<br>
as bull and bear markets.  They are optical illusions.
<br>
<p>That is, it is impossible at any time to predict whether the market
<br>
is going to rise or fall.  You can't say &quot;we are in the middle of a
<br>
bull/bear market and therefore the market is more likely than not to
<br>
rise/fall in the next few months.&quot;
<br>
<p>You can only recognize bull and bear markets retroactively.  When you see
<br>
a time when prices tended to rise, you call that a bull market.  When you
<br>
see a time where prices tended to fall, you call that a bear market.
<br>
When prices didn't have much of a trend, you'll say that was neither.
<br>
<p>So it doesn't make sense to say, buy stocks during a bull market and sell
<br>
during a bear market.  That's because it is impossible at any time to say
<br>
what the future course of stock prices will be.  All you can do is look
<br>
back, and with the wisdom of hindsight, say that you should have bought
<br>
here and sold there.  But that's not a way to make future decisions.
<br>
<p>These observations are based both on theory and practice.  I studied
<br>
some of the academic literature several years ago, and statistically
<br>
they found virtually no correlation between past price changes and future
<br>
price changes.
