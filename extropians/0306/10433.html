From: Brett Paatsch [mailto:<a href="mailto:paatschb@optusnet.com.au?Subject=RE:%20greatest%20threats%20to%20survival%20(was:%20why%20believe%20the%20truth?)">paatschb@optusnet.com.au</a>]

<em>&gt; 1) What is the probability of General AI in the next 20 years 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of *either* friendly or unfriendly variety? 
</em><br>
<p>It seems rather low to me.  There is no evidence of a fundamental
<br>
design breakthrough in the field of AI[*].  Without such a
<br>
breakthrough it seems unlikely that humans will be able to design an
<br>
artificial general intelligence (AGI).
<br>
<p>The alternative approach of uploading / simulating a human brain will
<br>
not be computationally viable in 20 years without a massive leap
<br>
beyond the Moore's Law projections for that time.  There is no
<br>
evidence for this massive computational leap either.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) Can friendly AI be built that would be competitive with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; un-friendly AI or would the friendly AI be at the same sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of competitive/selective disadvantage as a lion that wastes 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; time and sentiment (resources) making friends with zebras?
</em><br>
<p>This is a fine question.  I find the reports of evolution's demise to
<br>
be greatly exaggerated.  So long as the universe contains replicators
<br>
and competition for resources there will be evolution.  And as you
<br>
point out, unfriendly AIs may be more competitive than friendly AIs.
<br>
<p>mez
<br>
<p>* - I have a great deal of respect for Eliezer, Ben Goertzel, and
<br>
others in this community who are working on AGI.  However, until they
<br>
produce compelling experimental evidence, I'll put them in the
<br>
category of smart people working on a problem that has stumped every
<br>
other smart person who's worked on it.
