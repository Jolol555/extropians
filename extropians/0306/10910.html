<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; The psychological problem that most people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; against uploading, of course, is that of &quot;being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; inside a computer&quot;, or of knowing that one is really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; just on a silicon chip.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Perhaps its because I haven't read enough about it, but,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the reservation, I have against uploading, and also
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; cryonics is that I just not convinced that, appearances
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; not withstanding, the me that goes in, will be the me
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; that comes out.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We've seen these topics arise repeatedly on this list, with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very little or no change of viewpoint resulting from extensive
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discussion. 
</em><br>
<p>How could you know that there has not been a change of 
<br>
view? It would seem that if cryonics and uploading are 
<br>
sensible options and are explained to people with open 
<br>
minds and an interest then the 'peanut gets pushed forward'.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This seems [sic] to indicates that the prior beliefs we're 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dealing with are at fundamental levels which are rarely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; open to self  examination, and thus very resistant to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change.  It seems [sic] that these prior beliefs or biases
</em><br>
<em>&gt; come mainly from our evolutionary programming, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are  further reinforced by cultural programming. 
</em><br>
<p>Careful Jef this argument is in danger of coming apart at
<br>
the &quot;seems&quot;. ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The difficulty is perhaps not so much with learning more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about these subjects, but with the need to *unlearn* a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lot of the previous programming.
</em><br>
<p>This seems likely to be true to me too. Explorations of 
<br>
&quot;consciousness&quot; and &quot;personhood&quot; and the &quot;self&quot; may well
<br>
leave us confounded as to whether any of these terms can be
<br>
pinned down. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Many persons with scientific and philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; backgrounds struggle with concepts such as the nature of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; conciousness, personal identity, morality, free will, all of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  which appear to be contingent on the evolutionarily based
</em><br>
<em>&gt; sense of &quot;self&quot;. 
</em><br>
<p>Rings true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This strong sense of &quot;I am me, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything outside is not me&quot; seems to prevent one from
</em><br>
<em>&gt; adopting the wider perspective by which these apparently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paradoxical topics become transparent (and then one can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; discover and begin working on the next layer of the onion.)
</em><br>
<p>But clearly *everyone* is not prevented from adopting the 
<br>
wider perspective. If the wider perspective is more useful,
<br>
more valid. more true, then it would seem worth while to
<br>
try and mark the trails blazed by these daring lateral thinkers
<br>
whose eridition may be greater so that when policy is made
<br>
on the hand count of politicians more of the average folk 
<br>
are in favour, savvy, or at least less opposed.  
<br>
<p>There is also the possibility that some brave lateral thinkers
<br>
have wandered off the main trail and gotten themselves
<br>
lost. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Earlier today someone (Rafal?) mentioned the chinese
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;mu&quot; as an appropriate response when no correct answer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is possible due to the question not being meaningful in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; given context.  In such a case, widening the context
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (greater scope of understanding) so the discussion 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; illuminates both viewpoints can lead to progress, but how
</em><br>
<em>&gt; can this be done effectively on a  list such as ours?
</em><br>
<p>Well it seems discussing the issues of cryonics and uploading
<br>
with an open minded sceptic is not going to hurt the 
<br>
propagation of extropic memes. Maybe there are some folks
<br>
who don't have the sort of wit required to blaize the scientific
<br>
frontiers but do have the savvy, if first convinced themselves,
<br>
to increase the chances of cryonics facilities popping up like 
<br>
McDonalds restaurants. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've dreamed of having a set of web pages, generated by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a database relating arguments, counter-arguments, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; prior beliefs, in a way that would  interactively guide 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; someone from their current view point to (one hopes) a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more enlightened view point.  Perhaps such a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hypothetical system could refine its data and methods 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; by learning from each encounter.  Unfortunately, such
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a system is currently impractical to program due to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; combinatorial explosion that it would involve.
</em><br>
<p>Heck we don't even have a wiki or a faq. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I thought that perhaps a group effort, collaborating on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a database might make some progress toward this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; goal, but this now appears overly idealistic given actual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; social dynamics.
</em><br>
<p>Dunno. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps the great Google will eventually lead the way 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; toward enlightment for all...
</em><br>
<p>As cunning plans go that one seems a little under detailed
<br>
and over-optimistic to me.
<br>
<p>Regards,
<br>
