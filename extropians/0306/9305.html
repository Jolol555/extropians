</em><br>
<p>&quot;Should&quot; is a troublesome word. Should as in a moral ought, or should as 
<br>
in always present? And why the assumption that evolution is always good 
<br>
or present? (The last sentence has a partial answer: without evolution 
<br>
random drift is likely to decrease average fitness)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evolution, the way I understand it, involves changes, differences. 
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Or at least differential selection. However, the amount of 
<br>
variability in the genome that produces the maximal expected increase in 
<br>
fitness varies over time. Imagine a fitness landscape with a single 
<br>
peak in the otherwise fairly flat surface, and a population starting 
<br>
somewhere down on the plain.  At the start the optimal variance is very 
<br>
high, but most individuals have the same fitness. Then a few find the 
<br>
foothills of the mountain, and the differences in fitness between 
<br>
individuals increase. As the population climbs the mountain the optimal 
<br>
variance decreases, since the maximum is more likely closer than far 
<br>
away. Eventually the population ends up on the top and variance should 
<br>
be very small - there is no more fitness to find, and everybody has 
<br>
nearly the same fitness again.
<br>
<p>So the thing to look for is not differences in *outcome* but differences 
<br>
in *opportunity*, which cause the former. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If we want to evolve, does
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that mean that at some time, we will have to consider the rest of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; humanity as inferiors (lower on the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual/emotional/physical/etc chain)?  How does that fit into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; our ethical code of conduct?
</em><br>
<p>Why assume a chain (i.e. a scalar fitness)? Things are far more 
<br>
multidimensional, and one can evolve towards many different niches and 
<br>
goals. I do not see a chain of being as a goal, but rather an immense 
<br>
tree of clades. 
<br>
<p>Besides, why assume evolution to be the goal? As I see it the transhuman
<br>
goal is improvement of the human condition, but that is a process that
<br>
we seek to take control over rather than leave to impersonal forces. 
<br>
Evolution is a *means* to an end ((trans)human happiness), not an end in 
<br>
itself. We will seek the best tools available for autoevolution, but 
<br>
since it is such a complex process with many potential goals and 
<br>
non-obvious dead-ends we need a diversity of approaches in order to find 
<br>
the best ways to do it. Hence it would be a waste to not cooperate with 
<br>
the majority, since they have the diversity resources to try 
<br>
alternatives (beside the more obvious economic and political resources). 
<br>
<p>Looking down on people is self medication for low self-esteem, but it is
<br>
not a cure.
