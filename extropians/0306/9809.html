<em>&gt; By Greg Taylor of The Daily Grail 
</em><br>
<p>Check out www.thedailygrail.com - &quot;Incredulous and proud of it!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; - The beginnings of a book 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; manuscript, &quot;Debunking for Dummies.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Or &quot;Ranting By Example&quot; would work equally well.
<br>
<p>(snipped lots of reasonable-ish text descending gradually into ranting)
<br>
<p>I'm picking this up here where the writer really begins to go off the rails.
<br>
Hopefully someone else will have the time/energy for a point-by-point
<br>
debunking.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what drives the pseudo-skeptic to such extraordinary lengths? Why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do they attack their 'enemy' with such ferocity, and accusations of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nazism and other name-calling?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A primary motivation of the debunker would seem to be, quite simply, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jealousy. I've grown weary of the number of times I've been told how 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; unfair it is that Graham Hancock has experienced such success. But 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't mistake this jealousy as simply being in terms of personal 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; gain. James Alcock writes in Skeptical Inquirer:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;rather than honouring science, the public is generally disdainful 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of both science and scientist, while welcoming to their bosom the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; purveyors of magic, shamanism, and supernaturalism&quot; (13)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Jealousy... that's one word for it. I'd say an allergy to bullshit might be
<br>
involved, but hey, who am I?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; One pertinent point to note from this statement is how pseudo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptics always talk in terms of how the general public needs to be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; told what is best for them (by the pseudo-skeptic of course). And 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; yet they wonder why the public is disdainful. The other point is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the jealousy of the debunker has at its root their deep-seated 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; desire to have their particular worldview validated.
</em><br>
<p>Bzzzt, no. In a complex society such as our own, no one has the resources or
<br>
ability to research every claim. We rely on each other's efforts to validate
<br>
a small portion of the claims out there, using a common frame of reference -
<br>
rationality. It's not always perfect, for many reasons, but it's important
<br>
that somebody makes the effort to check claims, and when frauds/bs are
<br>
found, it's quite valid to publicize it as widely as possible. I know that I
<br>
personally appreciate this.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what is the underlying reason for the debunkers position? Why do 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they feel the need to &quot;portray science not as an open-minded process 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of discovery, but as a holy war against unruly hordes of quackery&quot; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (14)? The obvious conclusion is that behind this behaviour lies a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; large amount of insecurity. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;obvious&quot;: code for &quot;bullshit&quot; in most contexts
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In particular, anxiety that a carefully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constructed world-view, which helps them to make sense of the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and also often bestows upon them a position of power, may be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; dismantled at any moment. Any attempts by 'pseudo-scientists' to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; investigate outside this world-view are regarded as a threat, an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; attempt to pull the comfortable rug out from beneath the debunker's 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; feet. As much as the true skeptic harbours doubts about their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stance, the debunker attempts to convince themselves and others, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; through any means possible, that they are right. How can the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debunker, therefore, ever be considered anything more than a pseudo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptic.
</em><br>
<p>The flimsy crap about debunkers wears really thin by now. I think this guy
<br>
is attacking a strawman (or a horde of them)... any pro-science person worth
<br>
their salt knows that paradigms shift in all kinds of disciplines all the
<br>
time. Doubt and science go together. That's the very reason for the
<br>
aggressive critical stance!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That's not to say, however, that criticism of alternative theories 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is incorrect or somehow morally wrong in any way. Ideas and theories 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should always be questioned, but in a respectful manner, and with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the humility to realise that any position may prove to be completely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; incorrect. 
</em><br>
<p>What is a respectful manner? It'd be sad if &quot;alternative theorists&quot; had
<br>
their feelings hurt I guess. Wannabe scientific theories are guilty until
<br>
proven innocent.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; We should always question what we believe, and also why 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; we do so. In the end though, it is each person's inalienable right 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to construct a view of the world which fits the evidence of their 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experience best, and helps them to understand the world.
</em><br>
<p>Sure, and let natural selection sort them out...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; debunker does not believe in this philosophy however, and feels the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; need to impose their personal viewpoint upon others. 
</em><br>
<p>Well, not really. A sceptical person may feel a moral (!) duty to point out
<br>
bullshit (even potential bullshit) that preys apon the unwary. What isn't
<br>
said here is that one's worldview is not just a touchy-feely matter of
<br>
choice; it shapes one's life in many ways. A poor choice of religion can rob
<br>
the unwary of their personal possessions and freedom. A bad alternative
<br>
therapy can kill not only the believer, but those in his/her charge. A
<br>
reliance on suspect divination and pseudo-psychological techniques can
<br>
irreparably damage a person's mind. And because everyone can't evaluate all
<br>
the evidence all the time, and some people can't really evaluate much of it
<br>
at all, it is important that those who can do a decent job of it are really
<br>
vocal about problematic and potentially dangerous theories.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; It is high time 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that all parties showed more respect for philosophies different to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theirs, and made an attempt to understand them. 
</em><br>
<p>All of them???
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the pseudo-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; skeptic does not take my word for it, perhaps they'll listen to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; James Alcock, who wrote in Skeptical Inquirer (with the emphasis 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; added being mine) &quot;we may differ in our assumptions about the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; underlying nature of reality, but we are much the same as each 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other&quot; (15).
</em><br>
<p>Personally, I'll take the red pill.
<br>
Emlyn
<br>
<p><p>(ooh, I just noticed this tidbit:
<br>
&quot;As physicist Henry Stapp argues, physicalist science on 
<br>
its own is dangerous, because it leaves &quot;no rational basis for 
<br>
anything but self-interest the collapse of moral philosophy is 
<br>
inevitable&quot;(9).&quot;
<br>
It reminds me of that idea, disturbingly held by real christians that I have
<br>
met, that Atheists can have no morality and must be happy to run around
<br>
killing people and commiting all kinds of debaucherous acts.)
