Humania Commented:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; To M. Dickey, J. Clark and Ron h:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I refuse talking or discussing with anyone of you any of your arguments,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; especially those of Michael Dickey, in detail. It would be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; complete waste
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of time for both sides. Our views are not compatible.
</em><br>
<p>I dont think it would be a complete waste of time, but so be it.  I and
<br>
hopefully John and Ron will still criticize your comments as we see fit, and
<br>
especially point out where  we reasonably deem them to be detrimental to
<br>
human kind and non-extropic.  But seeing as John, Me, and Ron are the only
<br>
people who responded to your comments, and you clearly state you will not
<br>
respond to us, you are effectively stating uneqeuvocially that you will not
<br>
listen to objections to your stances, and will be ignoring (at least in the
<br>
case) the only people who responded to you.  So I wonder yet again what your
<br>
reason for posting is.  If it is preaching to the choir, that does not seem
<br>
productive, if it is to change others minds, your tactics, as I have noted,
<br>
are also not productive.  If it is to merely spew emotional reactions to
<br>
current events, again, probably not productive.
<br>
<p>Are you that sure that absolutely everything you believe is 100% true?  I
<br>
dont think anyone on this board (eh, mailing list) is that sure, especially
<br>
those who have studied for greater periods of time than either of us.
<br>
Personally I find the extropy mailing list a good place to have ones ideas
<br>
critiqued.  Recently I posted some comments on restructuring the US tax
<br>
system, Lee Corbin immediately and justly pointed out why this particular
<br>
suggestions was a bad idea.  I suggested that localized stem cell injections
<br>
could replace the majority of organ transplanting, and Robert Bradbury
<br>
pointed out some reasons why that may not be the case, etc. etc.
<br>
Considering that, do you beleive that your worldview is a 100% accurate
<br>
description of reality?  Surely you believe things today that you did not a
<br>
few years ago, and surely you will believe somethings to be different a few
<br>
years from now.  The trick is trying to pick what those things might be, and
<br>
never being too over confident in your current understanding.  Much like
<br>
standard scientific reasoning, everything is held to a level of provisional
<br>
certainty, and I believe the same standard of scientific reason can be
<br>
readily applied to many questions of history, ethics, and politics.
<br>
<p>I only want
<br>
<em>&gt; to remind
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you from time to time that your violent world view still looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disgusting to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a freelancing transhuman -
</em><br>
<p>Thats find, but I would remind you that your apathetic pacifism is digusting
<br>
to a transhuman and extropian, such as myself.  I would remind you that you
<br>
stated your main reason for opposing the war was to not give sanction to
<br>
Bush's future actions, instead of judging the action itself as moral or
<br>
immorral, you judged what possible actions bush might committ in the future
<br>
as immorral, and reversed judged everything else.
<br>
<p>but not necessarily *extropian* - guest here on
<br>
<em>&gt; this list who thinks the whole entropic side effect and expenditure of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blowing away heat and sweat into the universe in the process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bringing up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; some non-violent arguments that the patriots here finally do not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; appreciate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anyway, is in itself a pretty unextropian process of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; communication.
</em><br>
<p>You do not bring up arguments, as I have noted.  Most people on this forum
<br>
welcome well reasoned arguments, I have yet to see you present one.  I and
<br>
others have outlined in previous posts a bulleted list of reasons why the
<br>
Iraq war was just and extropian, and invited you to counter the points.
<br>
Instead you respond with comments like &quot;and-White-House-dominated thinking
<br>
in union with adrenalin-aided visualisations of smashing those Middle
<br>
Eastern bastards which amplifies the already existing territorial bullshit
<br>
in your brain&quot;   Where is the argument?
<br>
<p>like
<br>
<em>&gt; territorial pissings with funnily talking Arabs who stubbornly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; deny wearing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; blue jeans and display this strange effeminate outfit while unexpectedly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; rejecting the American way of life altogether,
</em><br>
<p>As you might have noticed on this list, Mez, whose family is egyptian, has
<br>
explicitely stated that most arabs indeed welcome American culture.  This,
<br>
in fact, is a primary thing that makes fundamentalist islamicists so irate.
<br>
Imagine a conservative radical islam jihadists emotions when he sees a clean
<br>
shaven arab youth sporting a leonardio decrappio haircut with a burqua-less
<br>
girlfriend singing celine dion.  Your comments reflect an ingorance of the
<br>
issue at hand, we are not trying to cram American culture down reluctant
<br>
Arabs throats, most Arab people like many aspects of American culture, and
<br>
would freely choose to embrace if not ruled by corrupt despotic regimes bent
<br>
on melding their cultural habits one way or another.  Americans could really
<br>
care if middle eastern kids are getting Decrappio haircuts, but a lot of
<br>
middle easterners care a great deal about that.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;could it be that your
<br>
<em>&gt; Pentagon- and-White-House-dominated thinking in union with adrenalin-aided
</em><br>
<em>&gt; visualisations of smashing those Middle Eastern bastards which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; amplifies the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; already existing territorial bullshit in your brain and - in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connection with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an artificially produced feeling of helplessness and lack of security -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evokes a cry for a Rumsfeldian solution and thus leads to an endlessly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intensified vicious circle of astonishingly flexible ancient lizard brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; circuits that spread the message towards the cortex to merely defend
</em><br>
<p>See, how is this statement productive?  You produce no arguments whatsoever,
<br>
only spew emotional venom that is a crass charachterization of mine, and
<br>
probably Ron and John Clark's motivations and concerns.  I am the one making
<br>
an effort to understand your arguments, you are making no such effort for
<br>
us, and instead resort to this rubbish.
<br>
<p>Regards from the Kill Files
<br>
<p>Michael Dickey
