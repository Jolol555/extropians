<p>
We seem to have forgotten about the list rules.  During recent discussions
<br>
about how to &quot;fix&quot; the list, I realized that it isn't broken.  We simply
<br>
aren't following the rules or keeping the promises we have made when we
<br>
subscribed to the list.
<br>
<p>Specifically, personal attacks, libelous statements, ad hominem, character
<br>
attacks, and insults are already disallowed.  We have all promised not to
<br>
use these tactics on the list.  Even those who believe that one or more of
<br>
these tactics should be allowed have promised not to utilize them within
<br>
this forum.
<br>
<p>Furthermore, we have all agreed not to defend ourselves on-line when
<br>
attacked.  We have unanimously agreed that in the interest of improving the
<br>
list signal-to-noise ratio that we will divert all personal defenses offlist
<br>
to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!">e_shaun@extropy.org</a> for an off-line resolution.  Even if someone tries to
<br>
start a personal battle, it should end right there with the response going
<br>
off-line.
<br>
<p>Lastly, even if the participants of the battle insist on fighting in public,
<br>
the rest of us do not need to put up with it.  It only takes a single
<br>
request to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!">e_shaun@extropy.org</a> to request that the list rules to be
<br>
enforced.  If nobody makes a complaint, it implies that we unanimously want
<br>
the personal attacks to be allowed.
<br>
<p>I have reviewed the list rules again and intend to start obeying them again.
<br>
I will stop responding to baseless accusations or trying to defend myself,
<br>
but will merely send a request to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!">e_shaun@extropy.org</a> to enforce the
<br>
existing list rules.  This is what the list rules require.  This is what we
<br>
have all promised to do.  I intend to start keeping my promise to obey the
<br>
list rules.  I encourage others to do the same.

We have a few rules about how you interact with the list. Your continued
subscription indicates your acceptance of these rules. We do not like
rules for their own sake. The List rules are just those we believe will
keep the level of discussion high and polite.
PERSONAL ATTACKS: We do not allow personal attacks or libelous statements.
Those violating this rule may be removed from the List without notice.
Those guilty of an ad hominem attack (i.e.: attacking the character of a
poster rather than combating the argument the poster proffers) will be
subject to a private warning on a first offense and a temporary or permanent
ban on each subsequent offense.  Extropy Institute's Executive Team will
determine the duration of said ban.
If someone attacks your character, insults you, or otherwise violates the
above rule, do NOT retaliate in like manner. Instead, send us a complaint
(to <a href="mailto:e_shaun@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20%20Time%20to%20enforce%20the%20List%20Rules!">e_shaun@extropy.org</a>) and take the matter off-list.
COPYRIGHT: It is a violation of our Rules and United States law to copy
material from copyrighted sources and post them to the List. Short excerpts
and summaries are fine.  Repeated violators of this rule may be unsubscribed
without notice.
ADVERTISING: It is against our rules to advertise or solicit business
without our permission. Many people online do not want to see solicitations
and sales messages when they are trying to read a high-density discussion
list. Certain kinds of solicitation may be permitted, but our permission
must first be obtained. Violation of this rule may result in termination
of your subscription. [Personal professional announcements or discussion of
personal professional activities are appropriate to the list, if they
generally relate to the over-all subject matter discussed there.]
This is a private forum. We reserve the right to unsubscribe anyone at any
time.
Thank you for your cooperation in making the Extropians List a stimulating
and
enjoyable forum.
