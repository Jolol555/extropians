<em>&gt; &gt; Why insider trading is illegal for the trader:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There is nothing in the law that prevents people from using their own
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; brains to predict stocks and make lots of money.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you use your brain to acquire information before it is reported to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; newspapers, and act on that information, then that action can be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; considered insider trading.
</em><br>
<p>Consider it this way:  Selling stock to someone else is a sales transaction
<br>
of property.  You are offering to sell a known commodity that is described
<br>
by public disclosure statements.  If you know those statements are false
<br>
due to insider information, and you sell the product to a buyer who
<br>
believes those public disclosures are true, you have cheated the buyer.
<br>
You knew that what the person said they wanted to buy was not what you were
<br>
actually going to deliver to them.  It is exactly like selling a car that
<br>
doesn't run, or selling a race-horse that has just died, or selling food
<br>
that has spoiled, or selling swamp land in Florida.  The law doesn't allow
<br>
this.  You can't sell property you know is worthless just because the buyer
<br>
doesn't know it yet.
