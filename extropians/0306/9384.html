<p>
AS&gt; Besides, why assume evolution to be the goal? As I see it the transhuman
<br>
AS&gt; goal is improvement of the human condition, but that is a process that
<br>
AS&gt; we seek to take control over rather than leave to impersonal forces. 
<br>
AS&gt; Evolution is a *means* to an end ((trans)human happiness), not an end in 
<br>
AS&gt; itself. We will seek the best tools available for autoevolution, but 
<br>
AS&gt; since it is such a complex process with many potential goals and 
<br>
AS&gt; non-obvious dead-ends we need a diversity of approaches in order to find 
<br>
AS&gt; the best ways to do it. Hence it would be a waste to not cooperate with 
<br>
AS&gt; the majority, since they have the diversity resources to try 
<br>
AS&gt; alternatives (beside the more obvious economic and political resources). 
<br>
<p>AS&gt; Looking down on people is self medication for low self-esteem, but it is
<br>
AS&gt; not a cure.
<br>
<p>The  way  I  see  it is that evolution (personal) is my way of living.
<br>
What  I  strongly believe is that if I do not evolve (i.e. get better,
<br>
fitter, more adapted) I will not and cannot live. I totally agree with
<br>
what  you  say  regarding  the  utilisation  of  the  wide  variety of
<br>
resources  offered  by  the  majority.  And indeed my point resides in
<br>
this: we want to use all these for our personal development. This is a
<br>
perfectly  self-centered  approach  to  relationship  with others. But
<br>
isn't  it  what  all  relationship is about at the end of the day? The
<br>
final  aim  is only to get things for yourself be it only satisfaction
<br>
of having achieved something for the benefit of others.
<br>
Looking  down  on  people  is  definitely  not the thing to do. On the
<br>
contrary, extending yourself towards others is in fact the best way to
<br>
get  what you want. Or else you'll end up lonely and worst, stagnant as
<br>
you will stuck only with yourself and your limitations.
<br>
<p>By  the  way,  thank  you  all  for  answering  me  on that. I've just
<br>
subscribed  to this list. And it seems that all of you will help me in
<br>
my  evolution  a lot. :) especially when it will come to correcting my
<br>
false assumptions and mistakes. Thanks again.
<br>
<p>BIL.
