Mandatory &quot;I told you so...&quot;
<br>
<p>Front page L.A. Times, June 27, 2003: &quot;U.S. Looks at
<br>
Organizing Global Peacekeeping Force&quot;
<br>
<p>Starting last year with Westercon, where Tad Daley
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.cunr.org/priorities/statement_Daley.htm">http://www.cunr.org/priorities/statement_Daley.htm</a>&gt;
<br>
ran a large open discussion forum on the creation of a
<br>
World Federation, and continuing with Daley (left
<br>
winger) and Jerry Pournelle (right winger technocrat /
<br>
military science fiction author / science advisory
<br>
panel to congress / science advisor to Newt Gingrich /
<br>
co-author of Star Wars plan) amazingly appearing
<br>
together on a related panel at LosCon, then
<br>
reappearing as a PBS blitz during the opening phase of
<br>
&quot;Iraqi Freedom,&quot; the drumbeat is continuing for the
<br>
creation of a U.S.-led International Police Force.  So
<br>
far the cards are falling exactly as I called them
<br>
almost a year ago.
<br>
<p>Note that I also predicted the Iraq war shortly after
<br>
9/11, based on information coming from Laurie
<br>
Melrouis, who was in charge of Iraq analysis under
<br>
Clinton
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-mylroie052902.asp">http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/comment-mylroie052902.asp</a>&gt;
<br>
<p>In neither case was the information itself or the
<br>
source particularly authoritative.  However, I asked
<br>
myself at the time, &quot;WHY are these people speaking out
<br>
the way they are, unless they expect to be proven
<br>
right or prophetic?&quot;  All parties mentioned have vast
<br>
resources of info and serious backgrounds in the
<br>
subject matter.  None of them are simple patsies
<br>
putting out some spin line.  They all have lives and
<br>
are forces in their own rights.  I.e., it was a safe
<br>
bet that they had insider info.
<br>
<p>When there did not appear to be any real justification
<br>
for the Iraq war on its own merits, I had to look
<br>
further, assuming a longer term, larger plan.  I doubt
<br>
that Pournelle or Daley had any idea that anyone would
<br>
put two and two together, but why else would they be
<br>
saying the things they were, separately and, bizarrely
<br>
- given their poles-apart politics, together.  As I
<br>
said almost a year ago, the point of the Iraq war is
<br>
to set a precedent that will serve as a stepping stone
<br>
for a world police system, a coalition of many nations
<br>
providing troops, money, logistics, etc., but led by
<br>
the U.S. and outside the U.N. or NATO.
