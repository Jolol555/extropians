Spike noted:
<br>
&lt;&lt;A few windmills are going up along 5 now  ... The glass is half full
<br>
and filling
<br>
steadily.
<br>
<p>spike    &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Yes, but internal combustion engines do not run on windpower. Are you
<br>
thinking that we ought to create fuel through solar energy and windpower
<br>
to fuel our cars? I didn't think so. :-)
<br>
<p>Mitch

<br>
No, I had in mind embedded powergrids in roadways to transfer
<br>
power to hybrid cars.  The cars would still have a small internal
<br>
combustion
<br>
engine aboard so that they could go anywhere, but they would get their
<br>
power 
<br>
from the road most of the time.  We would figure out the appropriate
<br>
ways to bill the owner for the power used, such as the current
<br>
automatic toll collection systems in use in many roads and
<br>
bridges.  We know that power can be transmitted via magnetic
<br>
induction, so all the technical problems already have waiting
<br>
solutions.  Alls we need is the will to get it done.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
If we have sufficiently abundant electric power, then innovative
<br>
solutions will be found to all our energy problems.  Right now
<br>
we are burning cheap oil because we can.  Furthermore, we
<br>
should do so, for we need to liberate the sequestered carbon before
<br>
we move on to renewable energy sources.  Carbon in the biosphere
<br>
is a good thing, friends, it really is.  Life was better in the
<br>
Jurassic.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
As for singularity on hold: not.  I doubt that process will be
<br>
seriously hindered by oil prices.  If oil ever does start to get
<br>
expensive,
<br>
we have technology ready and waiting to respond: efficient hybrid cars,
<br>
ultra-lightweight vehicles, many transportation-obviating communications
<br>
technologies, superinsulation of buildings, a bunch of stuff that
<br>
we have had for years but do not use because oil is so blamed cheap,
<br>
the stuff is practically free.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Robert mentioned the cost to phase over from internal combustion
<br>
to the next generation, well sure, there will be some pain.  But we can 
<br>
do it.    
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Right now humanity spends most of its energy fighting itself.  As
<br>
soon as we get over that, we can get to building really cool stuff
<br>
like electric roads and such.  We must find a resolution to our
<br>
current world war 4, then we will be ready to proceed.
