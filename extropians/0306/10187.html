</em><br>
<p>The problem is recognizing a sweetheart.  If one in
<br>
ten of these sweethearts go all Enron on you, then
<br>
the 10% profit you made on the others average out
<br>
to nada.
<br>
<p>My friend's experience in the market was an education
<br>
for me.  He finished a PhD in physics at Stanford in
<br>
1996.  He took up day trading, which he did more or
<br>
less full time for about 5 years.  He set up a number
<br>
of different funds with different trading strategies.
<br>
The one he set up for his daughter went under the
<br>
reasoning that she would have plenty of time for
<br>
recovery before she would need the money for college
<br>
(at least 15-17 years) so he bought all risky stuff:
<br>
venture caps, startups, high fliers.  That fund was 
<br>
hammered worse than all the others, as nearly all of 
<br>
those companies crashed.
<br>
<p>His long term conclusion was similar to what gts has 
<br>
been posting: that one cannot get ahead just from 
<br>
being intelligent, from reading public domain news, 
<br>
from any mathematical trend analysis or from just thinking.
<br>
The market is a chaotic system that cannot be modelled
<br>
using currently known techniques.  In the long term
<br>
the law of averages does catch up.  
<br>
<p>There is a filter in place: people talk a lot more
<br>
about their winners than their losers, causing others
<br>
to think they are net winners.  In fact the traders
<br>
may even fool themselves into thinking they have a
<br>
net gain, when careful bookkeeping would reveal they
<br>
are only breaking even or perhaps losing money compared
<br>
to the gutless prole (me) who drops his pennies into
<br>
a bank, a bond or real estate.  Add this to the fact
<br>
that the day traders are not working a 9 to 5, and
<br>
you find few winners.
<br>
<p>This explained something that puzzled me: why my fund 
<br>
managers were achieving only market average over the 
<br>
long haul, or actually not even market average.  My 
<br>
Dow index fund did better than my managed funds over 
<br>
the period of 95-present.  
<br>
<p>Dammit.
