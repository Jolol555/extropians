Just a thought..... It doesn't seem likely that massive breakthroughs are
<br>
predictable 20 years in advance. In 1949, noone expected to be on the moon
<br>
in 1969. In 1883, powered flight wasn't expected anytime soon. In 1976, the
<br>
current access to information was unfathomable except to a few people
<br>
speculating. There was no real expectation of it happening. Thus is the
<br>
nature of discovery.

<p><p><em>&gt; From: Brett Paatsch [mailto:<a href="mailto:paatschb@optusnet.com.au?Subject=Re:%20greatest%20threats%20to%20survival%20(was:%20why%20believe%20the%20truth?)">paatschb@optusnet.com.au</a>]

<em>&gt; &gt; 1) What is the probability of General AI in the next 20 years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of *either* friendly or unfriendly variety?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems rather low to me.  There is no evidence of a fundamental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; design breakthrough in the field of AI[*].  Without such a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; breakthrough it seems unlikely that humans will be able to design an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; artificial general intelligence (AGI).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The alternative approach of uploading / simulating a human brain will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not be computationally viable in 20 years without a massive leap
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beyond the Moore's Law projections for that time.  There is no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; evidence for this massive computational leap either.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 3) Can friendly AI be built that would be competitive with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; un-friendly AI or would the friendly AI be at the same sort
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of competitive/selective disadvantage as a lion that wastes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; time and sentiment (resources) making friends with zebras?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is a fine question.  I find the reports of evolution's demise to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be greatly exaggerated.  So long as the universe contains replicators
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and competition for resources there will be evolution.  And as you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point out, unfriendly AIs may be more competitive than friendly AIs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;

</em><br>
<em>&gt; * - I have a great deal of respect for Eliezer, Ben Goertzel, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others in this community who are working on AGI.  However, until they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; produce compelling experimental evidence, I'll put them in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; category of smart people working on a problem that has stumped every
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other smart person who's worked on it.
