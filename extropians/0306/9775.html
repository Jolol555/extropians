Seems that more and more often these days I stumble across the coolest stuff
<br>
while searching for something completely different. Here's an unlikely chain
<br>
of events which today led to your receiving this pointer to this interesting
<br>
article highlighting the new low-tech/high-tech rocketry paradigm.
<br>
<p>So I'm kicking around in my workshop wondering if I might have the necessary
<br>
raw materials to throw together a q&amp;d DIY cement mixer for a bunch of
<br>
concrete jobs I been planning to do around the yard.
<br>
<p>...maybe those five gallon plastic buckets over there in the corner? ....
<br>
nope too small ... hmm, how 'bout that old washing machine drum over there
<br>
... if I only had another of those ... bolt the two flanges together ...
<br>
even got that nice round hole in the middle to load ... screw in some boards
<br>
as mix fins ... mount the whole thing on a 2x4 saw horse ... with some old
<br>
shopping cart wheels for the drum to spin on ... I think I've even got an
<br>
old motor somewhere over here ... HEY! wait a minute. surely someone else
<br>
has thought of this before ... maybe even published plans for it sketches
<br>
and all on the web ...bet I'll have myself a printed copy in under five
<br>
minutes...
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>google?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[yes my son?]
<br>
<p>got anything on, say, 'homemade cement mixers'?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[perhaps, perhaps, but heyyyy, here's something that you might enjoy ...
<br>
and just three hits down the page!]
<br>
<p>cool, well ... um ... ok, maybe I'll just read part of it...
<br>
<p><p>...
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>...
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[russell?]
<br>
<p>yes google?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[what are you doing?]
<br>
<p>sending it to my buds on extropians .. it's really quite interesting...

<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[and what about the patio stones and fence posts you were going to make
<br>
this morning?]
<br>
<p>doh!
