I think you're thinking about the &quot;official&quot; explaination for the
<br>
accuracy of allied night bombing raids over Germany, which was that the
<br>
pilots ate a lot of carrots (supposedly this improves night vision).
<br>
However this was disinformation to hide the allied use of on-board Radar
<br>
and directional beacons.

<br>
May also be a confusion with the use by the miltary during WW2 of old people
<br>
who'd had their lenses removed for cataract operations.
<br>
This allows you to see into the near ultra-violet (to which the lens of the
<br>
eye is opaque).
<br>
They could then see the UV lights used by German agents to signal acorss the
<br>
channel, which were invisible to the naked eye.

Cool, I never realised I could do that (I've had cataract ops and so 
<br>
don't have any lenses in my eyes).  Any ideas how I could test this 
<br>
facility (preferably in a non-sight-damaging way?

<p>Go birding. Many birds that look dull to human eyes actually have bright UV
<br>
coloring.  Starlings, blue tits and zebra finches are the examples that seem 
<br>
to come up the most in my cursory web-search. You might want to take a look
<br>
at this reference:
<br>
Burkhardt, D. (1989). &quot;UV Vision: A Bird's Eye View of Feathers&quot;, _J. Comp.
<br>
Physiol. A_, 164:787-796.

Tricky. Most UV lights also emit visible light (so that you can tell that
<br>
they are on).
<br>
You'd either need to find a UV light which emits no visible light, or find a
<br>
filter which blocks visible light, but lets UV through (quartz-based, I
<br>
guess, since glass blocks UV).
<br>
As I recall, UV looks white to the human eye; shame, one might have hoped
<br>
for an exotic ultra-mondane colour.
