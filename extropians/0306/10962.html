</em><br>
<p>[Lee]
<br>
<em>&gt; Just to clarify my position, I do agree with Giulio here.
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I will grant that to me and everyone relating to you the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; duplicate will be satisfactory.  I am more &quot;selfish&quot; when
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it comes to me.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Absolutely!  This is the *crux* of the real philosophical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem! We ought to posit the existence of a Most Selfish
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Individual, and ask to what well-informed decisions he
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would come.
</em><br>
<p>There may be merit in that. I may actually know this guy :-)
<br>
Let me take a shot at describing him.
<br>
<p>The Most Selfish Individual's well-informed decision can only
<br>
be as good as his knowledge base. He is presumably rational
<br>
and open to learning better survival options, but knows, he is
<br>
not yet fully informed. He is &quot;jealous&quot; of his mental sovereignty
<br>
and will not accept as proven that which he doesn't understand.
<br>
He will make judgements on imperfect information, if he has to,
<br>
and he'll probably go for the cryonics procedure or upload as
<br>
a last resort, (if he doesn't delay too long). But short of that,
<br>
he'll probably try and replace all the organs in his body except
<br>
his brain and CNS and try to learn as much as possible about
<br>
the brain with the extra time purchased by the non-critical to
<br>
self organ replacements. In this way he hopes that any uploading
<br>
that will be done on him, will be done on the basis of as much
<br>
information and understanding of the notions of 'consciousness'
<br>
and 'self' and the modularity of living brains as possible. Any
<br>
'leap of faith' this Most Selfish Individual takes will be as *small*
<br>
and late as he can make them.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I don't care whether you and my duplicate and everyone else
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in the world agrees that .. the transformation that produces my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; duplicate has produce[d] me, I *care* that *I* am not *sure*
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that it is so beforehand.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; But we are talking about a survival-oriented, selfish view of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what is &quot;in it&quot; for an individual.
</em><br>
<p>*I* perceive the world from a stand-point that is necessarily
<br>
self-centred. *My* senses collect data and *my* brain interprets
<br>
it as information. My &quot;self&quot;, a process which I understand emerges
<br>
along with consciousness has amongst its attributes a desire for
<br>
&quot;self&quot; preservation. Its a pretty strong desire and my worldview
<br>
rightly or wrong informs *my* self about what seem to be more
<br>
and less optimal ways to pursue that desire. Personally, I don't
<br>
find altruism a particularly useful concept, except as a shorthand,
<br>
and I'm not sure it has anything to do with *my* desire for self
<br>
preservation one way or the other.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes; in every way your uploaded copy---or even you if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; are disintegrated at 10am tomorrow morning and then instantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; re-integrated using the same or different atoms---will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; this same impression.  It could, even now, be happening a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; hundred times a second.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; When you say &quot;could&quot; what are you basing your view on?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Suppose that there existed a machine that could decompose
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you into your constituent elements within a microsecond.
</em><br>
.
<br>
<em>&gt; Then suppose that a few microseconds later, it reconstitutes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you.  Now suppose that this entire process happens hundreds
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of times per  second.  There we are.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And this is NOT the place to inquire after the actual physical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; plausibility of such a device.  Yes, our notions of who and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; what we are do depend on our basic understandings of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; physics, but whether or not a certain technical breakthrough
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that is not conceptually significant ever occurs or not is moot.
</em><br>
<p>Ok. Stipulations noted. If I was to discover that this had in fact
<br>
been happening my worldview would necessarily change. I might
<br>
conclude that continuity cannot be a necessary precondition for
<br>
self-hood, as I have come to experience it, because I hadn't ever
<br>
had continuity, I'd have been mistaken. But I think I've missed
<br>
your point as I think I am repeating something I said earlier here.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; ... the question is once an adult level of sentience is achieved
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can you capture the recursion counters in the wetware? A
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; snapshot of the conscious process and memories and restore
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it either onto an identical wetware substrate or a different set
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of firmware on an upload. I don't know.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Why not?
</em><br>
<p>Are you asking why don't I know?
<br>
<p>Because I don't *know* enough about how my consciousness
<br>
and the experience of self-hood manifests to assume that it can
<br>
persist completely decoupled from a matter substrate for any
<br>
length of time. My current thinking is no substrate means no
<br>
conscious processing (or unconscious processing either). No
<br>
consciousness process means no self concept process. In short
<br>
I assume that no brain means a discontinuation of me because it
<br>
seems prudent to do so.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Are you suggesting that it will *never* be possible to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; root out every last property of the human brain?
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm not suggesting that, not the human brain in a generic
<br>
sense, though it might be so. It is likely that one cannot contain
<br>
a fully detailed working model of one own brain in one's
<br>
consciousness.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; And what about the easy way: a copy is made by a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnological device that simply gets all the atoms?
</em><br>
<p>What about it?
<br>
<p>Is this the scenario where life and consciousness spring
<br>
back into the new structure at the instant of its reassembly
<br>
because they were an inherent part of it?  In my experience
<br>
brains grow they aren't top down or bottom up assembled.
<br>
How do you bring about that instant in wetware when all
<br>
the pieces come together at once?  This would require
<br>
an extraordinary feat not just of construction but of
<br>
coordinating the synchronous assembly of perishable
<br>
components in real time and bringing them together in that
<br>
instant that is the deadline.   Doesn't seem &quot;easy&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for uploading, we will have to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wait to see what level of sophistication is truly required.
</em><br>
<p>Or further inquire and explore, perhaps an understanding of
<br>
consciousness and the self and of the modularity of brain
<br>
processes will reduce the requirement for, or the magnitude
<br>
of, any leaps of faith.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  It may be that stripping off one neuron at a time, noting its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; connections, and making sure that the machine implements an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalent architecture is sufficient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In *this* particular case, I do believe that functional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; equivalence is adequate to guarantee that the consciousness,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intelligence, etc., is the same---i.e., it feels that its you just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way you do, it is a difference without a difference, etc.
</em><br>
<p>To it, it's a difference without a difference. And you are
<br>
unlikely to be complaining ;-).
