<p><em>&gt;And here is my problem with this essay.  
</em><br>
<p>It wasn't an essay. It was an extract from Dr. Dean Radin's popular-science
<br>
summary of recent parapsychological work, cited in part 1 of 3.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;The writer says 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;over and over about how this or that is or is not done in other 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;disciplines.  I wish the writer would give an example.  I think radiation

</em><br>
<em>&gt;what they had.  Also an example of the psi that has been done and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;replicated over and over would help clarify the writer's point of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;view.  This writer builds a nice staircase the only problem is the writer 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;provides no support.  
</em><br>
<p>Read the book from which that `essay' was extracted, where plenty of
<br>
evidence is cited. Bear in mind, though, that Dr. Radin's own studies have
<br>
been assailed from some quarters *within* the `anomalous phenomena'
<br>
research discipline for their alleged statistical inadequacies. One of
<br>
Radin's most interesting and provocative recent findings is an effect he
<br>
calls `presponse', where it is claimed that horrifying images provoke an
<br>
advance EEG response prior to randomized presentation, compared with
<br>
psychologically neutral images (as established by standard psych tests).
<br>
Efforts are underway to scrutinize relevant data bases prepared in the past
<br>
by non-parapsychological neuroscientists; it has been said that some of
<br>
these already examined show just such a signature. However, a preliminary
<br>
report by Radin and Prof. Dick Bierman was withdrawn prior to publication,
<br>
so the status of the confirmatory evidence is currently moot. Google on
<br>
them for more.
