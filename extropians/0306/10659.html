<p>
Michael Wiik quoted from an Evening Standard report and I want to emphazise
<br>
some of these quotes here:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &quot;Like, the only way to get through s*** like that was to concentrate on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; getting through it by killing as many people as you can, people you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are trying to kill you. Killing them first and getting home.&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He said: &quot;S***, I didn't help any of them. I wouldn't help the f******.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There were some you let die. And there were some you double- tapped.&quot;
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; [...]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Making a shooting sign with his hand he went on: &quot;Once you'd reached the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; objective, and once you'd shot them and you're moving through, anything
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there, you shoot again. You didn't want any prisoners of war. You hate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them so bad while you're fighting, and you're so terrified, you can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; really convey the feeling, but you don't want them to live.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>What I find absurd and annoying but typical, is that in this publication
<br>
harmless words like *shit* and *fuck* are deleted while the description of
<br>
being a killing machine is laid aout in detail.
<br>
<p>On the eve of the Iraq war I found a similar attitude here on the list, too.
<br>
People who cold-bloodedly accepted that a lot of innocent civilians would
<br>
die in this war accused me of using shocking terms that referred to these
<br>
overwhelming peristaltic movements that automatically started in my guts
<br>
when being confronted with pictures of your proud and praying nation.  One
<br>
person even claimed that with my description of this visceral activity I had
<br>
left the path of civility while he and his co-patriots were willing to
<br>
sacrifice thousands of human beings for a not existing threat.
<br>
<p>Pretty soon these killing machines and mass murderers who did the job for
<br>
you will return to your country and will live among you. I know what it
<br>
feels like to live among mass murderes. My father was one, my 8 uncles were
<br>
war criminals, when they survived WWII, the priests I got to know were mass
<br>
murderers, almost all of my teachers had been killing machines and not a
<br>
single one of them was healthy and happy. They were all broken
<br>
personalities, somehow.
<br>
<p>To clarify my personal definition of a mass murderer: *every* person in a
<br>
mass murderer who killed more than two humans in his life, no matter if he
<br>
took part in a war of aggression or if he defended his country. You can
<br>
laugh about my definition and start to enumerate the reasons for a just
<br>
war - yes, yes, yes, but no, no no -  I don't give a damn about any war
<br>
convention. Even if you defend your country, *afterwards you must live with
<br>
the guilt* of having killed human beings. I don't know anybody of the mass
<br>
murderers I personally met who had not - in the deepest place of his heart -
<br>
a rest of guilt he had to drown with booze or other anaesthetics.
<br>
<p>In my imagination transhumanism cannot be achieved before the territorial
<br>
fighting mechanisms from the reptile brain are abolished or appeased or
<br>
cultivated somehow. One generation has to start with this mission
<br>
impossible. I would like to belong to this generation.
<br>
<p>Peace on earth
