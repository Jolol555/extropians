</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; a theist, a polytheist, or even a maxitheist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; So maybe I am an alltheist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are a theist about this world, as well as all the others.  Alvin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Plantinga is famous for this somewhat surprising enhancement to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Anselm's ontological argument.  The argument is as follows: presume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that you are a &quot;modal realist:&quot; a believer in the idea that there are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities called possible worlds, within at least one of which all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities are actual(ized).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, we can define &quot;God&quot; to be an entity with maximal &quot;greatness&quot;,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is plausibly defined as a being which is morally perfect and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;necessary&quot;: existing in all possible worlds.  Or none at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Other candidates for &quot;necessary&quot; entities might be the empty set,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the number 1, and the geometric point.) Well, in that case, &quot;God&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists in all possible worlds, or none at all.  [Do not omit the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scare quotes in this argument; its unusual definition is the whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt; key to getting it off the ground.]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Since you say that &quot;God&quot; exists in some possible world, you are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; therefore forced to conclude that &quot;God&quot; exists in all possible words,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; including, of course, this one!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Of course, if you think that there is ANY possible world in which
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;God&quot; doesn't exist, you are similarly forced to accept that &quot;God&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; exists in no possible worlds at all!
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; While not even Plantinga thinks that the argument is a good proof, or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even very convincing, it does serve to galvanize the debate: either
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;God&quot; exists necessarily, in all possible words, or &quot;God&quot; necessarily
</em><br>
<em>&gt; *doesn't* exist in ANY possible worlds.
</em><br>
<p>### I think that the use of words such as &quot;necessary&quot;, together with
<br>
&quot;greatness&quot; and &quot;moral perfection&quot;, allows me a lot of wiggle room to avoid
<br>
the charge of being a this-world theist. If we were to say that all that is
<br>
necessary for the &quot;God&quot; to claim actual existence in this Hubble volume is
<br>
to have persons defining him/her/it, then indeed there would be God on
<br>
Earth. Even more - if we were to ascribe moral perfection and maximal
<br>
greatness to the empty set, such &quot;God&quot; would be present in all possible
<br>
worlds.
<br>
<p>Yet, I would have little interest in such semantic sleight of hand, using a
<br>
word with some connotations as a pointer to entities devoid of most of such
<br>
connotations. For practical purposes, I am not aware of any evidence that a
<br>
god of any matter-moving kind meddled anywhere within 13.7 billion
<br>
lightyears from here. I expect that the measure of my continuations actually
<br>
encountering gods, compared to the measure of me's who never meet a god,
<br>
will be quite low. Therefore, I do not feel obliged to worship or otherwise
<br>
adapt my behavior or expectations for the future, the main issues of
<br>
interest for me. Should the likes of Mr Plantinga wish to worship the empty
<br>
set, good luck to him. I presume he will be granted an infinite existence
<br>
within his &quot;God&quot; after leaving our present location.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I encourage you to read more about this here:

<p>### Thanks. It is quite amusing. Old Anselm' argument is so easy to shoot
<br>
down.
