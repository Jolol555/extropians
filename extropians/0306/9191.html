<p>
A Field Guide to Skepticism&quot; is Chapter 13 in Dean Radin's well-
<br>
researched, widely-read book, The Conscious Universe (HarperEdge, 
<br>
1997). Dr. Radin is highly respected among his peers who investigate 
<br>
paranormal phenomena for his scholarship, intellectual honesty, 
<br>
experimental ingenuity, and attention to detail. Before anyone, 
<br>
debunker or not, makes any claim about the reality of psi, he or she 
<br>
should read this book. 
<br>
<p>Chapter 14: A Field Guide to Skepticism 
<br>
Dean I. Radin 
<br>
<p>FROM THE CONSCIOUS UNIVERSE 
<br>
<p>I am attacked by two very opposite sects – the scientists and the 
<br>
know-nothings. Both laugh at me – calling me &quot;the frogs'
<br>
dancing-master.&quot; Yet I know that I have discovered one of the 
<br>
greatest forces in nature. – Luigi Galvani, Italian physician
<br>
(1737–1798) 
<br>
<p>This chapter does not argue against skepticism. On the contrary, it 
<br>
demonstrates that critical thinking is a double-edged sword: It must 
<br>
be applied to any claim, including the claims of skeptics. We will 
<br>
see that many of the skeptical arguments commonly leveled at psi 
<br>
experiments have been motivated by non-scientific factors, such as 
<br>
arrogance, advocacy and ideology. The fact is that much of what 
<br>
scientists know – or think they know – about psi has been
<br>
confused with arguments promoted by uncritical enthusiasts on one 
<br>
hand, and uncritical skeptics on the other. History shows that 
<br>
extremists, despite the strength of their convictions, are rarely 
<br>
correct. So, are all scientists who report positive evidence for psi 
<br>
naïve or sloppy? No. Are all skeptics intolerant nay-sayers? No. 
<br>
Does psi justify the belief that angels from the Andromeda galaxy 
<br>
are among us? No. 
<br>
<p>DOUBT
<br>
<p>There are two ways to be fooled. One is to believe what isn't
<br>
true; the other is to refuse to believe what is true. – Søren
<br>
Kierkegaard 1813–55)
<br>
<p>THE NECESSITY OF DOUBT 
<br>
<p>Skepticism, meaning doubt, is one of the hallmarks of the scientific 
<br>
approach. Skepticism sharpens the critical thought required to sift 
<br>
the wheat from the chaff, and it forces experimental methods, 
<br>
measurements, and ideas to pass through an extremely fine sieve 
<br>
before they are accepted into the &quot;scientific worldview.&quot; A little 
<br>
critical thinking applied to many of the claims of New Age devotees 
<br>
reveals why many scientists are dubious of psi phenomena. Science 
<br>
requires substantial amounts of repeatable, trustworthy evidence 
<br>
before taking claims of unexpected effects seriously. Depending on 
<br>
the claim, providing sufficient evidence can take years, decades, or 
<br>
half-centuries of painstaking, detailed work. Learning how to create 
<br>
this evidence requires long training and experience in conventional 
<br>
disciplines like experimental design, analysis and statistics. 
<br>
Conducting research on controversial topics like psi requires all 
<br>
this plus an appreciation for interpersonal dynamics, politics, 
<br>
aesthetics, philosophy, and physics, combined with intellectual 
<br>
clarity and a strong creative streak to help break the bounds of 
<br>
conventional thinking. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt;From the lay perspective, science appears as a logical, 
</em><br>
dispassionate, analytic process. This is true sometimes, but it is 
<br>
also a harshly adversarial, emotional battlefield when it comes to 
<br>
evaluating unusual claims. The process of gaining acceptance for 
<br>
effects that are not easily accommodated by dominant theories takes 
<br>
an enormous amount of energy and persistence. This is why most 
<br>
scientists and psi researchers alike grimace upon reading breathless 
<br>
advertisements hawking, &quot;The amazing miracle blue crystal, found 
<br>
deep beneath an ancient Mayan pyramid, proven by top researchers to 
<br>
relieve headaches and enhance psychic powers, and now available for 
<br>
a limited time for only $129.95!&quot; 
<br>
<p>The claim about a blue crystal is not the problem. After all, if 
<br>
someone were to claim that a moldy piece of bread could cure all 
<br>
sorts of horrible diseases, they'd be labeled a charlatan, unless 
<br>
the mold happened to be penicillin. The problem with many popular 
<br>
psi-related claims, especially claims for health-related products 
<br>
and devices, is that it doesn't take much digging to discover
<br>
that sound, scientific evidence for the claim is either entirely 
<br>
absent, fabricated or based solely upon anecdotes and testimonials. 
<br>
<p>THE DANGER OF UNCRITICAL DOUBT 
<br>
<p>It's one thing not to see the forest for the trees, but then to
<br>
go on to deny the reality of the forest is a more serious matter.
<br>
– 
<br>
Paul Weiss
<br>
<p>However, the same scientific mind-set that thrives on high precision 
<br>
and critical thinking is also extremely adept at forming clever 
<br>
rationalizations that get in the way of progress. In extreme cases, 
<br>
these rationalizations have prevented psi research from taking place 
<br>
at all. Ironically, the very same skeptics who have attempted to 
<br>
block psi research through the use of rhetoric and ridicule have 
<br>
also been responsible for perpetuating the many popular myths 
<br>
associated with psychic phenomena. If serious scientists are 
<br>
prevented from investigating claims of psi out of fear for their 
<br>
reputations, then who is left to conduct these investigations? 
<br>
Extreme skeptics? No, because the fact is that most extremists do 
<br>
not conduct research, they specialize in criticism. Extreme 
<br>
believers? No, because they are usually not interested in conducting 
<br>
rigorous scientific studies. 
<br>
<p>The word &quot;extreme&quot; is important to keep in mind. Most scientists 
<br>
seriously interested in psi are far more skeptical about claims of 
<br>
psychic phenomena than most people realize. Scientists who study psi 
<br>
phenomena grind their teeth at night because television shows 
<br>
predictably portray psi researchers as wacky &quot;paranormal 
<br>
investigators&quot; with dubious credentials. Psi researchers cringe at 
<br>
seeing the word &quot;parapsychologist&quot; used in the telephone yellow 
<br>
pages to list psychic readers. And unfortunately, because the only 
<br>
thing most people know about parapsychology is its popular 
<br>
association with credulous &quot;investigators&quot; and psychic over-
<br>
enthusiasts, it is understandable why some skeptics have taken 
<br>
combative positions to fight what they see as rising tides of 
<br>
nonsense. 
<br>
<p>This book is intended to help illustrate that common stereotypes 
<br>
about psi research are overly simplistic at best, and in many cases, 
<br>
they are just plain wrong. As an example of &quot;just plain wrong,&quot; here 
<br>
is one stereotype that many mainstream scientists have simply 
<br>
accepted as conventional wisdom. As philosopher Paul Churchland put 
<br>
it, 
<br>
<p>Despite the endless pronouncements and anecdotes in the popular 
<br>
press, and despite a steady trickle of serious research on such 
<br>
things, there is no significant or trustworthy evidence that such 
<br>
phenomena even exist. The wide gap between popular conviction on 
<br>
this matter, and the actual evidence, is something that itself calls 
<br>
for research. For there is not a single parapsychological effect 
<br>
that can be repeatedly or reliably produced in any laboratory 
<br>
suitably equipped to perform and control the experiment. Not one.
<br>
<p>Wrong. As we've seen, there are a half-dozen psi effects that
<br>
have been replicated dozens to hundreds of times in laboratories 
<br>
around the world. As another example, conventional wisdom often 
<br>
assumes that professional magicians and conjurers &quot;know better&quot; than 
<br>
to accept that some psychic phenomena are real. In fact, as 
<br>
parapsychologist George Hansen wrote, Although the public tends to 
<br>
view magicians as debunkers, the opposite is more the case. Birdsell 
<br>
(1989) polled a group of magicians and found that 82% gave a 
<br>
positive response to a question of belief in ESP. Truzzi (1983) 
<br>
noted a poll of German magicians that found that 72.3% thought psi 
<br>
was probably real. Many prominent magicians have expressed a belief 
<br>
in psychic phenomena. …. It is simply a myth that magicians have 
<br>
been predominantly skeptical about the existence of psi.
<br>
<p>SKEPTICISM ABOUT SKEPTICISM 
<br>
<p>Why it is necessary to spend any time at all on the criticisms of 
<br>
psi research when we can simply refer to the previous chapters to 
<br>
demonstrate that there are valid experimental effects in search of 
<br>
answers? One answer is that very few are aware that the standard 
<br>
skeptical arguments have been addressed in exquisite detail, and 
<br>
they no longer hold up. Another is that the tactics of the extreme 
<br>
skeptics have been more than merely annoying. The professional 
<br>
skeptics' aggressive public labeling of parapsychology as 
<br>
a &quot;pseudoscience,&quot; implying fraud or incompetence on the part of the 
<br>
researchers, has been instrumental in preventing this research from 
<br>
taking place at all. In a commentary in the prominent journal, 
<br>
Nature, skeptical British psychologist David Marks wrote, 
<br>
<p>Parascience has all the qualities of a magical system while wearing 
<br>
the mantle of science. Until any significant discoveries are made, 
<br>
science can justifiably ignore it, but it is important to say why: 
<br>
parascience is a pseudo-scientific system of untested beliefs 
<br>
steeped in illusion, error and fraud.
<br>
<p>Such statements are pernicious because significant discoveries do 
<br>
not occur by themselves. Such statements published in influential 
<br>
journals have had strong effects on the ability of scientists to 
<br>
conduct psi research. Many funding agencies, both public and 
<br>
private, have been reluctant to fund parapsychological studies 
<br>
because they fear being associated with what conventional wisdom has 
<br>
declared to be a &quot;pseudoscience.&quot; Fortunately, there are notable 
<br>
exceptions among funding agencies who know that there is a 
<br>
difference between popular stereotypes and serious researchers.
