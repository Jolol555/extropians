When the United States was being formally set up by the founding fathers
<br>
both in the Articles of Confederation and during the Constitutional
<br>
Convention, there was clearly divided thought as to the purpose and
<br>
extended power of any federal government. Those who favored a
<br>
vested-interest, mercantilist-protectionist form of central government
<br>
did so with one thing in mind: empire building. Alexander Hamilton
<br>
argued for this cause in the &quot;Federalist Papers&quot;, John Adams stood on
<br>
this side along with Henry Clay as did James Madison. But with Madison
<br>
also went the admonition that the ultimate power of government resided
<br>
with the individual states and if they desired, they could secede from
<br>
the union.
<br>
<p>On the other side of the stood the democratists -- those who firmly
<br>
believed that it was the people of the individual states in whom resided
<br>
the power of any confederation of states and it was the people of those
<br>
states who should have the right to secede from the union of states if
<br>
they felt so disposed. On this side stood Thomas Jefferson and John C.
<br>
Calhoun.
<br>
<p>In response to British piracy of American shipping, President Jefferson
<br>
in 1807 imposed a trade embargo against England. The New England
<br>
Federalists were so outraged at this limitation on their trade, they
<br>
plotted to secede from the Union. The vested interests of the 'Whigs'
<br>
were not being served at the hand of the Democratic president,
<br>
Jefferson. Later on, during the 1850-early 60's, it was the South that
<br>
wanted to secede from the Union because by that point in time, it was
<br>
the Northern states Federalists who were were imposing economically
<br>
disastrous tariffs upon the South; tariffs that began in earnest with
<br>
the administration of President Andrew Jackson.

<p>It seems that it wasn't specifically addressed; up until it became an
<br>
issue that is.
<br>
<p>The soviet union specifically has a clause to deal with it (something I
<br>
find quite amusing btw);
<br>
it states that membership in the soviet union is voluntary.
<br>
<p>I think Lincoln's viewpoint is the current thinking, in that I don't
<br>
think a state could secede 
<br>
now [although I suspect, one could always make the argument].  Anybody
<br>
here a lawyer with a 
<br>
bent for constitutional law?
