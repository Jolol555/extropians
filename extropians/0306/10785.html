<p>I'm out of my depth here, but I wonder whether thinking about maximum
<br>
range doesn't miss the issue.
<br>
<p>A while back I read a bit about WWII-era battleship fights.  One
<br>
aspect that stuck in my mind was the difficulty of hitting your
<br>
opponent at all.  I'm not sure how stable a gun platform a steaming
<br>
ship in heavy sea is.  The target keeps moving around, too.  And
<br>
while the ballistics of your guns are known (from empirical testing,
<br>
I suspect, rather than first principles), the environmental conditions
<br>
are variable with wind, rain, etc.  When you are shooting at a
<br>
distance of several km's, these things add up.  I understand ship
<br>
artillery started shooting with a guesstimate, observed how far
<br>
they were off, and tried to compensate.
<br>
<p>With this in mind, shooting dumb rounds beyond the horizon looks
<br>
entirely pointless to me.  Certainly for anti-ship use.  You are
<br>
not going to hit anything.  For engaging targets at long range you
<br>
really want something with homing ability, either missiles or, if
<br>
fired from a gun, at least smart projectiles that have terminal
<br>
guidance.
<br>
<p>One aspect that seems to come up when talking about railguns is the
<br>
prospect of _much_ higher muzzle velocities, allowing flatter
<br>
trajectories and higher accuracy.  This may or may not incidentally
<br>
increase the maximum range.  Very light projectiles at very high
<br>
speeds would quickly shed speed at longer ranges, but for close
<br>
range work if you can throw a piece of metal at close to escape
<br>
speed at your opponents, you are going to hit them instead of just
<br>
harassing the fish.
