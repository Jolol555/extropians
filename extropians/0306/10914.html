</em><br>
<p>A clear definition of information in this context would be helpful.
<br>
<p>Maybe others are information to one and one is information to
<br>
others but one is more than information to oneself. One can 
<br>
think of others as interpreted data streams. But one experiences
<br>
oneself as more than a data stream. One experiences oneself as
<br>
a continuing process. Perhaps this experience *is* illusory, but it
<br>
would seem that the burden of proving that such is illusory should
<br>
rest not with those who hold a more traditional view of the self,
<br>
such as, &quot;I have a self (whatever that is) and its uninterrupted
<br>
continuance matters to me&quot;, but with those who would argue for
<br>
a more limited view of the self as mere illusion and information 
<br>
irrespective of energy flow.

<em>&gt; If you are the same person you were 10^43 Planck 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; increments ago, even though all of the matter waves in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your body have shifted places, why would you not be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same person after a slightly different interaction within 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the same huge wavefunction?
</em><br>
<p>I don't understand your question because I am not familiar
<br>
with &quot;matter waves&quot; or what is meant by the phrase &quot;a slightly
<br>
different interaction within the same huge wavefunction&quot;. 
<br>
<p>Is it actually *necessary* to understand these concepts to get
<br>
at the truth here? Maybe it is. If so, I think the truth in this
<br>
respect is not likely to overlap with the general public's
<br>
worldview any time real soon.
<br>
<p>&lt;snip&gt;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; You are dynamics of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; information in a probability distribution, dynamics distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; over an unimaginable number of changes and interactions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stretched over an incredibly long time period.
</em><br>
<p>I'm lost, I think, because I've not following your use of the term
<br>
information. Self referential information seems to be more than
<br>
information to me. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt;  Uploading is a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; change scarcely more drastic, and no more high-level, than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the changes your brain is undergoing right now. 
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; It is only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the appearance of substance, the illusion of stuff, that leads
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you to think there is any difference between just standing 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there having a temporally evolving brain and being uploaded.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Each is a physical evolution that preserves complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; correlations in the wavefunction, and this is all that matters.
</em><br>
<p>Maybe if I get a better handle on this wavefunctions thing I'll
<br>
be more knowledgeable and need to take less of a &quot;leap&quot;.
<br>
<p>But if an explanation can be crafted which doesn't need
<br>
quantum physics it will be easier to propagate.
<br>
