<p><em>&gt; I've asked this question several times but never got
</em><br>
an answer, if the incredible rage in the Islamic
<br>
community that has no rival in the modern world was
<br>
really caused because they thought a tiny sub group of
<br>
them that most have never seen and lived thousands of
<br>
miles away were mistreated then you would expect an
<br>
ever greater homicidal rage in another people who were
<br>
far far more horribly treated. So why are Jews not
<br>
crashing airliners into German skyscrapers?
<br>
<p>With respect, John, the two situations are
<br>
sufficiently different to question the strength of the
<br>
analogy.
<br>
<p>The war against the nazi's --it is necessary to
<br>
distinguish between nazi's and Germans--is over, and
<br>
the nazi's are beaten, disposed of, and their
<br>
&quot;message&quot; not merely discredited, but assigned an
<br>
enduring place in modern culture as an exemplar of
<br>
evil. Whatever nazi's remain are hunted relentlessly. 
<br>
While in historical treatments there is the most
<br>
severe intolerance for anyone inclined towards what we
<br>
hold culturally axiomatic, that there is always
<br>
&quot;another side of the story&quot;, ie, the nazi side.  (I
<br>
cringe even writing the sentence.) 
<br>
<p>In contrast, the &quot;action&quot; against Islam--and in
<br>
particular in Israel/Palestine--and the process of
<br>
legitimizing it, is ongoing and expanding.  The US and
<br>
Israel hold the &quot;action&quot; to be defensive, while much
<br>
of the non-Muslim world and all of the Muslim world
<br>
view these &quot;actions&quot; as an ongoing criminal
<br>
aggression.  And, of course, on all sides, truth
<br>
becomes an unwelcome stranger.  An unaffordable luxury
<br>
to the aggrieved, and a death sentence to the guilty.
<br>
<p>In short, Nazism vs the Jews is a dead issue, while
<br>
the US/Irael vs Islam is a very-much-alive-and-ticking
<br>
time bomb.
<br>
<p>Best, Jeff Davis
<br>
<p>&quot;Enjoying being insulting is a youthful corruption of
<br>
power. You lose your taste for it when you realize how
<br>
hard people try, how much they mind, and how long they
<br>
remember.&quot;
