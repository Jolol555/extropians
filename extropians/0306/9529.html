</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;I think one problem with this analysis is that you are demanding too
<br>
much from an ethical system. I expect an ethical system to describe an
<br>
optimal set of agreements to enable cooperation between beings that can
<br>
benefit from cooperation. Hypothesizing a situation in which the beings
<br>
would refuse to cooperate simply implies that you've described a situation
<br>
where ethics are irrelevant. Why should I care what an ethical system
<br>
advocates under circumstances where evolutionary pressures suggest the
<br>
ethical system will probably be ignored?
<br>
<p>&nbsp;If economists actually stuck to Pareto-optimality, they wouldn't be
<br>
able to say nearly as much as they actually do (see page 25 of Friedman's
<br>
Law's Order). They need to optimize something that doesn't require
<br>
unanimous consent for each change, such as efficiency. This distinction
<br>
can be made relatively unimportant if people can agree on rules for
<br>
compensating anyone who claims to be victimized by a change that does
<br>
not qualify as a Pareto improvement.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;Rejecting the utilitarian worldview and replacing it with a contractarian
<br>
system may also deal with the complaints about dealing with spatial infinities.
<br>
The contractarian can feel free to ignore any beings which he will never
<br>
be able to communicate with in his lifetime. (What about the possibility
<br>
that my life expectancy is infinite and will be able to communicate with
<br>
an infinite number of beings? I'm not sure, but I suspect that it won't
<br>
matter much if I ignore the welfare of infinitely distant beings for a
<br>
few centuries while I think about that problem.)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;I reject both averagism and totalism because there's no reason to think
<br>
evolutionary pressures would have selected for either.
<br>
&nbsp;Averagism implies that it is wrong to have children under circumstances
<br>
where some people clearly want to have children and where they have strong
<br>
evolutionary pressures to maintain those desires. I don't want to fight
<br>
evolution (at least not until we have the tools to win at a low cost).
<br>
&nbsp;Totalism comes closer to being consistent with evolved desires, but it
<br>
appears to go a bit too far. In evolutionarily recent times, having an
<br>
extra child without being able to devote resources in excess of some
<br>
threshold to that child reduced the mother's evolutionary fitness by
<br>
risking the mother's life for an inadequate chance of raising the child
<br>
to maturity. That threshold appears to produce happiness that is well
<br>
above the threshold that a true totalist would require.
<br>
&nbsp;So I expect my desires will most likely be satisfied by an ethical
<br>
system that looks a lot like totalism, but only creates new life if
<br>
that life is expected to meet some (as yet poorly defined) threshold
<br>
of happiness that is higher than what a true totalist would require.
