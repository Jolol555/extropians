</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ................
</em><br>
<p>Hmm, starting millennarian communes? Isn't that a bit backward looking? 
<br>
:-)
<br>
<p>I think we are unlikely to draw closer together, at least *if we are
<br>
successful*. If we are successful, transhumanist ideas about open
<br>
societies, distributed solutions, using technology to transform the human
<br>
condition etc will become more and more part of the mainstream debate. We
<br>
will be involved with projects related to this, some of us maybe make a
<br>
living as pundits and academics debating these issues, others run 
<br>
companies or simply support through everyday means. There will be a great 
<br>
variety of things to do, and the border between extropianism and society 
<br>
at large will fade. That also means that transhumanists won't be isolated 
<br>
and have little reason to flock together unless they want to meet old 
<br>
friends or maybe share a sense of &quot;more transhuman than thou&quot;. 
<br>
<p>The only reason for us to strongly band together is because everybody
<br>
else doesn't understand us or oppose our aims - and then we have failed
<br>
as a movement of ideas. In that case a distributed cell structure makes 
<br>
more sense than a great ship. 
<br>
<p>The aircraft carrier Extro 1 is very cool - I would love to participate 
<br>
in such a project. But I would participate because it is cool, not 
<br>
because it makes much political or economical sense. If we want something 
<br>
useful, I recommend starting companies together with people you agree 
<br>
with, can work with and know how to turn a profit (not necessarily 
<br>
transhumanists themselves). 
<br>
<p>[Longtime list members have heard this rant before; I seem to be stuck 
<br>
in a stimulus-response pattern when it comes to Oceania-like solutions 
<br>
:-)]
<br>
<p>ABlainey: 
<br>
<em>&gt; This prompts me to voice one thing I have noticed about the list in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; general (from my viewpoint anyway) As a group I think we are adding to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; extropy. At the same time, we are all doing it through individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; efforts. Other than regional meetings, etc., Extropianism seems to be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; very solitary affair. Where each of us is still waging our daily war
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the everyday problems of life. We still have to work, pay bills
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and live in our own houses, with no help from fellow extropes other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than rare snippets of advise.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Pooling our talents in a collective pot would seem a very obvious and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hopefully profitable endeavour. Maybe we should forward a few ideas for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an extropian business? we are all online and im sure many of us would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be very happy to devote time and knowledge if we had a financial gain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We already have Writers, researchers and probably everything we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start an online publishing company.  Maybe a new everyday life list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would help, where we could exchange ideas and advise on everyday
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things. Such as health, finances even just swap recipes.
</em><br>
<p>On one level I couldn't agree more, on one level I disagree a lot. 
<br>
<p>Lets start with the disagreement: I doubt there will ever be a company
<br>
encompassing most of the extropian list. Imagine that this entire list
<br>
was gathered in a room. Would you seriously consider sharing your
<br>
financial future with some of the... ahem, *characters* standing in the
<br>
corners? Would *they* want to do it with you? Just because we share some
<br>
basic ideas doesn't mean we agree on others, and people might be 
<br>
differently suited for different jobs - but not necessarily know it. 
<br>
<p>My own experience in starting a think tank is that even when you select
<br>
from people you know fairly well and agree with, there is going to be
<br>
quite some trial and error before you get the right people who can
<br>
contribute to a company and make it a success. A mailing list is an
<br>
agora, an open place where everybody can come and go, and that makes it a
<br>
good place to meet new people. But finding the right people to a company
<br>
is a selection process where one has to find the right candidates, not 
<br>
just people who happen to like the idea. 
<br>
<p>The agreement part is that I think the right way of approaching this is 
<br>
to look for business opportunities where one can both be transhumanist 
<br>
and make money. Not just one, but both. That way they reinforce each 
<br>
other, and we get rewards for being true to our ideas and we get a chance 
<br>
to do what we like. Start out small, and keep your feelers out for other 
<br>
similar nexi. We can work together professionally.
