<p>Ok, I think I understand this and it is a good point.
<br>
<p>So, with respect to weapons that have a &quot;critical mass&quot;,
<br>
the degree of enrichment is very important.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes, but how many terrorist groups have massive automated facilities to
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Granted... But who *really* knows what is going on in the mountains
<br>
of Chechnya?  We are all aware of Cheyenne Mountain.  But how many
<br>
of us are aware of deep tunnels around Moscow to protect the Soviet
<br>
elite?  I am not certain they exist as I've only heard hints about
<br>
this but I do have some experience with how the Russians operated
<br>
and could easily believe they exist.  If one has an opportunity
<br>
to view the Moscow City subway one has an awareness of what
<br>
is possible -- it makes the NY City subway look like an effort
<br>
of children playing with toys.
<br>
<p>I will freely grant that terrorists may currently lack the capital
<br>
resources to do something like this currently.  But then we get
<br>
into a question of how long that may be true?  And with tons
<br>
of raw material floating around on the open market it is rather
<br>
a serious question.
<br>
<p>I agree that it may take time.  But terrorists have plenty of that.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The real threat we can't deal with is some group hacking together a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nuke in their mountain cave redoubt.
</em><br>
<p>Ok, we generally agree here -- but hacking together a dirty bomb
<br>
requires much less cleverness than a critical-mass nuclear bomb.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The problem they deal with is also the amount of radiation they put out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to the environment increasing the risk of their detection.
</em><br>
<p>I would generally agree, but I suspect that the shielding isn't
<br>
that difficult to attain.  How many governments monitor the
<br>
purchasing of lead for example?
