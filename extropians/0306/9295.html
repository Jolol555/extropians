<em>&gt;&gt; The Failure of NASA: And a Way Out
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; by Philip K. Chapman
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; <a href="http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03zn1.html">http://www.spacedaily.com/news/oped-03zn1.html</a>
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; He's bold enough to propose his solutions,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but after reading the 3 pages of the author's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; article, I get the feeling that they are less
</em><br>
<em>&gt; workable than he suggests.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 1) I believe the end of the Apollo project was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; due only to the lack of national compettiton
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from the USSR. Once the space race was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; won, public interest all but vanished.
</em><br>
<p>I'm not so sure about that.
<br>
<p>Also, as many have pointed out, with the advent of Chinese interest in
<br>
pursuing manned spaceflight and Indian in pursuing lunar mission, such
<br>
competition could return.
<br>
<p>2) All these aerospace engineers are as good
<br>
<em>&gt; at economic estimates as I am-which is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say-negative.
</em><br>
<p>Partly true.  Overall, the aerospace industry is plagued by cost-plus
<br>
financing and massive subsidies.  These help to make it economically
<br>
inefficient.  My solution is to remove the subsidies and whatever
<br>
government contracts do remain should not adopt a cot-plus method of
<br>
funding.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3) We need some primary breakthroughs,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; either in new inventions, or innovations the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improvement of capability of already known
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies. Private industry, unless its
</em><br>
<em>&gt; got plenty of tax dollars headed its way, will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not see the need to participate in space
</em><br>
<em>&gt; habitation.
</em><br>
<p>I disagree.  I'm not against innovation or breakthroughs, but most of
<br>
the popular space projects -- a lunar base, Mars missions, space
<br>
recreation, space settlements, asteroid mining, etc. -- can be done or,
<br>
at least, started with current technology.  E.g., space recreation --
<br>
tourism, etc. -- can be done with current technology.  Granted, to do it
<br>
safely and routinely will require working out some kinks, but a bare
<br>
bones space recreation project like just doing the John Glenn ride or
<br>
even the Apollo 8 mission has already been done.  Ditto for a lunar
<br>
base.  Etc.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 4) Because of the above listed factors, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; suspect that his ACCESS replacement
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of NASA won't work, because the basic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; facts on the ground have not changed.
</em><br>
<p>Whoa!  I'm a proponent of just getting rid of NASA (as well as spreading
<br>
salt over it to make sure it doesn't grow back:) and not replacing it
<br>
with anything than of ACCESS, but ACCESS would change &quot;the basic facts
<br>
on the ground,&quot; especially the financial incentives.  If what you said
<br>
were true, then the satelite launch market as it exists today should not
<br>
exist.  The Challenger explosion made the government rethink its space
<br>
policy and eventually to mandate that NASA get out of the satelite
<br>
launch market.  What we have today is the satelite business could, I
<br>
believe, carry over into other arenas of space activity.  Getting NASA
<br>
out of the way will get the ball rolling.
<br>
<p>Of course, this does not mean if NASA were shut down tomorrow, by
<br>
Christmas United and American Airlines would be in a price war over
<br>
lunar flights.:)  It would take a few years, but the market would then
<br>
develop in a way that would be much different than having bureaucrats
<br>
hand out contracts for politically popular projects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Only technical development to make travel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to space for industry, or the discovery of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; miracle materials-only available from the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; asteroids, Moon, or Mars; which will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; compel the private sector to invest, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; invest mightily.
</em><br>
<p>Not necessarily.  Those things would be nice, but, to use but one
<br>
example, space tourism would build a likely profitable infrastructure
<br>
from which other things could grow.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; So what is my answer? Breakthroughs, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering, materials science, chemical
</em><br>
<em>&gt; engineering, biological apps. Fund these,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and commerical space travel and habitation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will follow. Let the be underfunded, and we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as a species will wait the decades it will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; take to achieve these advances, that comes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from scientific pursuits, in the typical hap-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hazzard way.
</em><br>
<p>Allow private competition in the space market and the innovations will
<br>
be made by those involved.
<br>
<p>Also, your position is not that far from Chapman's.  After all, he wants
<br>
ACCESS to fund &quot;exploration and scientific research&quot; as well as support
<br>
the &quot;development of enabling technology.&quot;
<br>
<p>Cheers!
