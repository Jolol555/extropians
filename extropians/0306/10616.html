Friends,
<br>
<p>Hal Finney has become the interim list moderator. During the interim 
<br>
period, we are in touch with E.Shaun to return as moderator. If you have 
<br>
any questions, comments, or suggestions, please send them to 
<br>
info@extropy.org.  Thank you Hal!
<br>
<p><p>Extropians Email List Guidelines
<br>
<p>_______________________
<br>
<p>List Rules
<br>
<p>We have a few rules about how you interact with the list. Your continued 
<br>
subscription indicates your acceptance of these rules. We do not like rules 
<br>
for their own sake. The List rules are just those we believe will keep the 
<br>
level of discussion high and polite.
<br>
<p>Personal Attacks: We do not allow personal attacks or libelous statements. 
<br>
Those violating this rule may be removed from the List without notice. 
<br>
Those guilty of an ad hominem attack (i.e.: attacking the character of a 
<br>
poster rather than combating the argument the poster proffers) will be 
<br>
subject to a private warning on a first offense and a temporary or 
<br>
permanent ban on each subsequent offense. Extropy Institute's Executive 
<br>
Team will determine the duration of said ban.
<br>
If someone attacks your character, insults you, or otherwise violates the 
<br>
above rule, do NOT retaliate in like manner. Instead, send us a complaint 
<br>
(to <a href="mailto:info@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">info@extropy.org</a>) and take the matter off-list.
<br>
<p>Copyright: It is a violation of our Rules and United States law to copy 
<br>
material from copyrighted sources and post them to the List. Short excerpts 
<br>
and summaries are fine. Repeated violators of this rule may be unsubscribed 
<br>
without notice.
<br>
<p>Advertising: It is against our rules to advertise or solicit business 
<br>
without our permission. Many people online do not want to see solicitations 
<br>
and sales messages when they are trying to read a high-density discussion 
<br>
list. Certain kinds of solicitation may be permitted, but our permission 
<br>
must first be obtained. Violation of this rule may result in termination of 
<br>
your subscription. [Personal professional announcements or discussion of 
<br>
personal professional activities are appropriate to the list, if they 
<br>
generally relate to the over-all subject matter discussed there.]
<br>
<p>This is a private forum. We reserve the right to unsubscribe anyone at any 
<br>
time.
<br>
<p>Thank you for your cooperation in making the Extropians List a stimulating 
<br>
and enjoyable forum.
<br>

<p>Unsubscribing, Administration, Posting Protocol 13051acd.jpg
<br>
<p><p><p>If you post to the Extropians List, you must anticipate that your writing 
<br>
might be forwarded to another list or to particular individuals. Postings 
<br>
will appear in a publicly accessible archive at:
<br>
&lt;<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/</a>&gt;<a href="http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/">http://www.extropy.org/exi-lists/extropians/</a> 
<br>
<p><p>Please be aware that Extropy Institute does not take responsibility for the 
<br>
use or misuse of posts addressed to the extropians list.
<br>
<p>Formal complaints and administrative requests should be sent to: 
<br>
<a href="mailto:info@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">info@extropy.org</a> (except sub and unsub requests, which go to 
<br>
&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:majordomo@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">majordomo@extropy.org</a>&gt;<a href="mailto:majordomo@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">majordomo@extropy.org</a>)
<br>
<p>Mail to the list should be sent to: 
<br>
&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">extropians@extropy.org</a>&gt;<a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">extropians@extropy.org</a>
<br>
<p>The software that processes traffic on the list alters the mail headers so 
<br>
that all correctly working mail readers will automatically address replies 
<br>
BACK to the LIST. [reply-to: 
<br>
&lt;mailto:<a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">extropians@extropy.org</a>&gt;<a href="mailto:extropians@extropy.org?Subject=Re:%20META:%20Hal%20Finney,%20Interim%20List%20Moderator">extropians@extropy.org</a>]
<br>
<p>If you want to reply to an individual poster you should manually address a 
<br>
reply. If the post does not have a signature line, viewing the message in a 
<br>
text editor should help you determine the sender's address.
<br>
<p>It is strongly recommended but not required that all list members use a 
<br>
signature containing their e-mail address.
<br>
<p>Due to the volume of list traffic please restrain yourself from 
<br>
over-quoting previous posts-- just a couple of lines to re-cap for those 
<br>
who weren't following the discussion is usually sufficient.
<br>
<p>Traffic on this mailing list can run quite high. We like to keep the 
<br>
signal-to-noise ratio as high as we can, so please restrain the impulse to 
<br>
post &quot;me-too&quot; messages or ad hominem flames to the list at large. If you 
<br>
cannot resist engaging in such discourse, please do so in private e-mail.
<br>
<p>Given the number of subscribers to the extropians mailing list, we strongly 
<br>
recommend that you restrain yourself to a MAXIMUM of eight posts per day. 
<br>
Those guilty of exceeding the eight posts per day limit will receive a 
<br>
private warning. Repeat offenders will be subject to other measures such as 
<br>
temporary or permanent bans from the list.
<br>
<p>Posts about the list, or its rules, should have the pre-fix &quot;META:&quot; We 
<br>
encourage the use of other prefixes indicating the content of a post. 
<br>
Examples include, PHIL:, MATH:, SCI:, CHAT:, etc.
<br>
<p>Since the topic of discussion on the list can change constantly within a 
<br>
single thread, we ask that the subject lines change accordingly. If you 
<br>
feel that a thread is going off the original topic, that's perfectly 
<br>
fine... but please change the subject line to let all list readers know 
<br>
what the topic has become.
<br>
<p>History has proven that some topics, which are occasionally introduced on 
<br>
the extropians list, have been controversial enough to provoke 
<br>
long-lasting, heated exchanges. The main topic of controversy in the recent 
<br>
past has been that of guns and gun rights, though there are other issues, 
<br>
which have had a similar effect. While it is Extropy Institute's policy not 
<br>
to ban any topic, new members to this list should be forewarned as to the 
<br>
potential consequences of posting on this and other issues. We once again 
<br>
encourage you to read the list for a while prior to posting.
