<p>Fortunately in adults there is very little angiogenisis taking

place.  So it is reasonable to use anti-angiogenisis drugs without
<br>
having to worry too much about side effects.

<p><em>&gt; I imagine we are probably building up a catalog of cancer cells in

</em><br>
<p>Oh, there are large libraries of cancer cells, presumably at
<br>
the NCI and elsewhere.  HeLa cells being the prototypical example.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyone know what the technological bottleneck is on identifying

</em><br>
<p>The problem is basic biology.  Proteins that control cell division
<br>
generally operate only within the cell or within the nucleus,
<br>
not on the cell surface.  One doesn't need cell surface proteins
<br>
to mutate (usually) to cause excessive cell division.  Sometimes
<br>
one gets mutations for secreted proteins that cause the cell
<br>
to stimulate itself into dividing -- but then they aren't attached
<br>
to the surface of the cell.  The internal proteins are digested
<br>
and are often displayed on cell surface, but exactly which fragments
<br>
get displayed (and these are small 9-12 amino acids) depends on
<br>
which set of MHC genes one has.  If the mutations responsible
<br>
for cancer are not those that one can display in the MHC proteins
<br>
then it is very difficult to detect cells that are in the process
<br>
of becoming cancerous and eliminate them.  In effect, it is true
<br>
for many cancers that the same reason one cannot develop a monoclonal
<br>
antibody is the same reason your immune system doesn't eliminate
<br>
the cancerous cells -- one cannot &quot;see&quot; what has gone wrong
<br>
*inside* the cell.
<br>
<p>Its going to take nanorobots to solve that problem.
