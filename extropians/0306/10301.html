Friends,
<br>
<p>Please send any complaints to me.  E.Shaun is functioning in another 
<br>
capacity with ExI.  Currently, we do not have a list moderator, as I 
<br>
assumed we were adult enough not to need one.
<br>
<p>However, I seem to be proven wrong.  I am open to suggestions on how to 
<br>
prevent the type of hedging and positioning we have witnessed and which is 
<br>
lacking in grace, intelligence and fair-play.
<br>
<p>We have suggested time and time again that if someone wants to start a list 
<br>
on politics, please do so.  Since it is not the directive of ExI (and the 
<br>
only politics I personally find intriguing are one that have yet to be 
<br>
determined), why are you all so persistent on expressing your angst and 
<br>
disdain for what you don't like about any one political stance on this list!!
<br>
<p>There are so many topics that are worthy of discussion and need to be 
<br>
discussed in order for us to aptly deal with the future and how we are 
<br>
getting there.  Why waste so much of the bandwidth of this list on topics 
<br>
that cause problems?  Each person should think for him or herself about 
<br>
whether or not you actually working toward a transhumanist future or just 
<br>
angry at life today.
<br>
<p>In order to move forward, if you have any suggestions or comments about the 
<br>
list, I am all ears.
<br>
Please email me privately.
<br>
<p>My best to you all.
<br>
<p>Natasha
<br>
