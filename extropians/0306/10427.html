</em><br>
<p>A general argument for &quot;Just Be Rational&quot; must acknowledge general costs, 
<br>
as well as general benefits.  It takes a lot of work to try to be rational, 
<br>
and it takes work to lie about what you believe, and there are social costs 
<br>
when you fail to successfully lie about your rationality.  Without some 
<br>
reason to believe your evolutionary heritage will substantially mislead 
<br>
you, &quot;Just be Natural&quot; seems a better strategy.  I do agree that we are 
<br>
entering an era when in fact our evolutionary heritage does mislead the 
<br>
types of people who populate this list.  So &quot;Just Be Rational&quot; may well 
<br>
soon be best for such people.  But that is a much narrower claim.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;...  Truthseeking is a simple and intuitive idea.  The idea that we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;execute adaptive self-deception is a complex counterargument.  A box of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Little Debbie snack bars is a simple but iffy illustration of the complex 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;reply to the complex counterargument; the Singularity is a more valid 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;illustration, but less accessible.
</em><br>
<p>Being natural is also simple, and even more intuitive.  For most people the 
<br>
possible benefits of avoiding snack bars just do not outweigh the many 
<br>
costs of being rational.  If that was the main benefit, it's not worth it.
