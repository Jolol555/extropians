<em>&gt; (Mike Lorrey &lt;<a href="mailto:mlorrey@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20The%20Simulation%20Argument%20again">mlorrey@yahoo.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; However, I'd like to point out some misperceived conclusions. For
</em><br>
<em>&gt; example, I'd agree that the odds that we live in a simulation are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undetermined. I went on to point out that given such a situation, the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; only proper stance for a scientific individual at this point in time is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be agnostic, NOT atheistic. Atheism is as much a leap of faith in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such a state of undetermined reality as religiosity. It is NO LESS a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; leap of faith as well. If the argument that we live in a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; holds true, then atheism is a completely improper stance and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; religiosity should be the norm, since the existence of a simulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies some meta-entity creating and/or operating the simulation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Now, I can entirely forsee that based on this logic, individuals
</em><br>
<em>&gt; determined to hold fast to their atheistic faith will try to undermine
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the simulation argument, while the religious will try to support it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; IMHO this should and can be a real debate that the religious can take
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part in equally, and should cast aside lots of the silly aspects of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mainstream creationism that depend on obsolete science.
</em><br>
<p>This contention has two problems, as it clearly must by the fact
<br>
that I have a great admiration for the simulation argument and yet
<br>
remain an ateist.  First of all, to equate religious notions of
<br>
God with notions of wholly non-supernatural beings that might be
<br>
running a simulation is to totally ignore centuries of theology.
<br>
We're bombarded again and again with hundreds of ideas about God;
<br>
the fact that /one/ of those ideas (i.e. &quot;creator&quot;) might be true
<br>
says nothing about the rest. That's the &quot;package deal&quot; fallacy.
<br>
<p>Second, the old &quot;atheism is a faith too&quot; canard has been debunked
<br>
so many times by those more capable than I that I hardly feel up
<br>
to the task, but I'll try, just for the record: As a rational being
<br>
I cannot totally reject any possibility for all time under all
<br>
possible circumstances. All knowledge is tentative, and must change
<br>
with new evidence. But that doesn't mean I can't base decisions on
<br>
what I consider to be my current working model of the universe, based
<br>
on the best knowledge I have so far. This working hypothesis is my
<br>
&quot;world view&quot;, if you will. It differs from &quot;faith&quot; in that I
<br>
explicity understand it to be tentative even though I may bet my life
<br>
on it every day. I have no choice, after all: it is necessary to
<br>
have /some/ world view to base one's actions upon or else one is
<br>
impotent. So my current world view includes things like the laws of
<br>
physics, math, evolution, and the absence of anything resembling
<br>
historical theistic descriptions of God. But I am not &quot;agnostic&quot;
<br>
about God any more than I am &quot;agnostic&quot; about physics, just because
<br>
I can't offer complete, final, unassailable proof of either one.
<br>
Simple honesty demands that I describe what I believe in simple
<br>
terms: I believe that atoms exist, and that God doesn't. Just because
<br>
I can't prove the non-existence of God any more than I can prove
<br>
the non-existence of Santa Claus, that doesn't mean I have to hold
<br>
some wishy-washy ineffective stance that Santa Claus /might/ exist
<br>
as part of my present world view. That's just a waste of effort. I'd
<br>
rather simply conclude for now that there's no Santa Claus, and live
<br>
my life under that assumption until something foces me to reexamine
<br>
it. Calling that &quot;agnosticism&quot; is a cop-out. If you asked me whether,
<br>
really, deep down, as part of my present being, whether I thought
<br>
there was a Santa Claus, I wouldn't answer &quot;maybe&quot;, I'd answer &quot;no&quot;.
<br>
That's what I think, right now. Same for God. Today, I am an atheist.
<br>
That's not taking a leap of faith or making a dogmatic commitment;
<br>
it's simple honesty.
