The Food Timeline has been created by the Morris County Library.
<br>
'Information is checked against standard reference tools for 
<br>
accuracy--The Oxford Companion to Food (Davidson), The Cambridge World 
<br>
History of Food (Kiple &amp; Ornelas), Larousse Gastronomique (New American 
<br>
Edition, Lang [1988] and Revised/Updated English edition [2001]), The 
<br>
Encyclopedia of American Food &amp; Drink, (Mariani), Food in History 
<br>
(Tannahill), History of Food (Toussaint-Samat), and other sources as 
<br>
needed. As with most historical topics, there are some conflicting 
<br>
stories in the field of food history. We do our best to select and 
<br>
present the information with the most documented support.'

<p>The food timeline page agrees that agriculture started around 10,000 BC 
<br>
when bread and beer appeared. (By the way, don't you think that giving 
<br>
up hunter gathering for the beer was a good exchange?)
<br>
<p>sheep and goats - 9,000 BC
<br>
lentils         - 8,000 BC
<br>
pork and beans  - 7,000 BC
<br>
<p><p>But wild rice is a much older plant with the genus going back to the 
<br>
early Cretaceous period of more than 130 million years ago. If you 
<br>
follow the links, an interesting history is described.
<br>
<p>'Cultivation of the wild prototypes preceded domestication. Rice grains 
<br>
were initially gathered and consumed by prehistoric people of the humid 
<br>
regions where the perennial plants grew on poorly drained sites. These 
<br>
people also hunted, fished, and gathered other edible plant parts as 
<br>
food. Eventually, however, they developed a liking for the easily cooked 
<br>
and tasty rice and searched for plants that bore larger panicles and 
<br>
heavier grains.'
<br>
<p>This seems to be claiming that stone age man could have been eating wild 
<br>
rice as part of his diet. The Paleo diet enthusiasts would surely 
<br>
disagree with that?

<br>
looking forward to his Chinese chicken and char sui pork tonight ;)
