Matus asked:
<br>
&lt;&lt;Does anyone else on the list feel that the current communist vietnamese
<br>
government is a legitamate one?  Note I will not be attacking those who
<br>
express this opinion, I am just curious how prevealent this opinion is on
<br>
this list.  Samantha, do YOU feel the current communist government of
<br>
Vietnam is a legitimate one?  Does anyone on this list (besides Jeff) feel
<br>
as much?&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>They are &quot;legitimate&quot; in the sense of the fact that ARVN did not want to 
<br>
fight. Now, are they the kind of government, I would wish on a dog, hell no! But 
<br>
just like Iran and Iraq, there was something in the people that tolerated these 
<br>
types of governments, promoted them, allowed them to take their sons in the 
<br>
military and security forces, and that their sons voluntarily oppress the rest. 
<br>
Easy for me to say, yet the lack of counter-revolution is evident. I am 
<br>
assuming that the current anti-Mullah fever will soon be swept away in Iran.
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Secondly, Jeff makes various assertions about my debating abilities,
<br>
including claiming that many of my 'facts' are inventions of my idealogy, I
<br>
am dishonest and insulting, incoherent, I am not qualified to discuss
<br>
political topics, undisciplined, lack effort..&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>Look, when people whine about debating methods, its just so much empty 
<br>
writing that is better ignored, rather then addressed. Them's that dishes it out, 
<br>
must also taketh - Book of Yog Sothoth, Chapter 6, verse 211    Now let us all 
<br>
prey!
