<em>&gt; It would be nice if what you said were true, but alas I think it is

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Evolution has 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; just use without understanding them.  This isn't a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; particularly dangerous 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; strategy for the usual evolutionary reasons: your ancestors 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; did pretty well 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; following these habits, so you probably will to.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You might tell your girlfriend that she is average among the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girlfriends 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have had, and that you think you are likely to stay with 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; her for the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; average time.  You might admit you are an average lover and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; driver, that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the products you sell are average, and that your in-group is no more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally justified than any other group.  You might rarely 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; disagree, and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accept that others are right as often as you.  You might 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; admit that you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; care almost nothing about poor people in Africa.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; When you do so, the likely consequences are that people will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consider you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; less able, less caring, and less loyal, then they otherwise 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would.  They 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may choose to associate with you less because of this.  Now 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; maybe they will 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; also realize that you seem to be especially truth-oriented, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and want to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; keep you around because you can provide instrumental benefits of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth.  But they may not care about the truth near as much as 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they care 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; about loyalty, and your ability to accomplish most of your 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; other goals in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; life will be thereby diminished.  That may be acceptable if 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you put a high 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; enough value on truth, but otherwise it may not be.
</em><br>
<p>Now we are getting into confused territory. There is a difference between
<br>
knowing the truth and being truthful. It may be a bad idea to tell your
<br>
girlfriend that she is average (LOL!) on your girlfriend-o-meter, but it's
<br>
probably better to know that you really feel that way yourself.
<br>
<p>It seems to be perfectly rational, in a social context, to lie; in fact,
<br>
many people do it most of the time, rationally. As to whether it is rational
<br>
to actually believe a lie, I can't think of a single situation. Well, maybe
<br>
if there is a rational action that you need to take... say you need to cut
<br>
off your own arm to escape an accident, and you find that you need to pray
<br>
to a god to &quot;find the strength&quot; to do it, then it's probably rational to
<br>
adopt the false belief (assuming you find that possible).
<br>
<p>A separate situation to consider is whether it is ever rational to not seek
<br>
the truth, knowing that you don't currently possess it. I'd say this is an
<br>
unqualified yes. It is always the case that we have incomplete information,
<br>
some of which must be incorrect. Yet to act, we must have made a judgement
<br>
that further truth seeking is not worth the cost. It is plausible that the
<br>
amount of truth to find may in fact be infinite, which is a proof in itself
<br>
that it is rational to not seek the whole truth.
