<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; When the 911 attacks came, I thought &quot;***NOW
</em><br>
<em>&gt; SURELY***
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; people will ask 'Why?'
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're assuming that if somebody hates you then you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; must have done something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; wrong, 
</em><br>
<p>No, I'm saying if somebody hates you and does
<br>
something incredibly bad to you, there's likely gonna
<br>
be a reason behind it.  You can look for it
<br>
systematically, rationally, or you can decide you know
<br>
the answer, declare it to be &quot;thus and so&quot; and be done
<br>
with it.  The latter method would seem to have it's
<br>
limitations, chief among them the severe likelihood
<br>
that prejudice will lead to error.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; but hate can be generated far easier than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt;  Some segment of Islam--maybe even a very large
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  &gt; fraction--may disapprove of western cultural
</em><br>
<em>&gt; values
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes indeed!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; but so long as we keep it here, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; don't force it on
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; them, it's probably not something they
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; care a whole
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; lot about.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; In the above you seem to be saying that the Islamic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; community is infused
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with a basic libertarian attitude, and I'm saying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; baloney.
</em><br>
<p>That's how you feel.  Fair enough.  I don't know about
<br>
libertarian attitude.  I'm really just guessing based
<br>
on my notion that people are pretty much the same
<br>
everywhere.  They care about things starting with
<br>
themselves and then moving outward.  Their families,
<br>
friends, their neighbors, the larger
<br>
neighborhood/community, and then provincial and
<br>
national affairs, and then the affairs of strangers in
<br>
far away lands.  I can't think that they concern
<br>
themselves too very much with strangers in faraway
<br>
lands.  Regular people care about things in proportion
<br>
to how it affects them personally.  Or so it seems to
<br>
me. 
<br>
<p>With the modern spread of cultural memes, as noted by
<br>
Ramez Naam, I can see the fueling of a desire to have
<br>
more, to have what we have, and envy as well, even
<br>
strong envy.  But homicidal hatred? I don't see it. 
<br>
Even a more distinctively negative reaction, a being
<br>
repulsed by what they see as some kind of decadence,
<br>
or corrupted morality. Is this by itself gonna make
<br>
someone so hate-filled that they will come half-way
<br>
around the world to murder people?  You may honestly
<br>
think so.  I don't see it.
<br>
<p>If on the other hand large groups of heavily-armed
<br>
foreigners with attitude(Europeans in this case) show
<br>
up uninvited and proceed to make trouble--kill people,
<br>
steal stuff, tell you what to do, and treat you with
<br>
overt contempt,...then I can see it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; It's the aggressive intrusion of the west that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; inspires their antipathy.  The crusades.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 800 years ago, get over it!
</em><br>
<p>I was just starting at the beginning.  Too far back? 
<br>
Ok.  How about Nov 2, 1917?  Less than a century ago. 
<br>
People are still alive today(not many) who were alive,
<br>
mature, aware, and concerned back then.  How about
<br>
1920, or 1922, or 1929, or 1936?  How far back can I
<br>
go?  What are the rules on this?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;             &gt;The invasions of western &quot;colonial&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; powers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; For a very brief time in their history, and the USA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; was never part of it.
</em><br>
<p>More's the pity.  If the British and French hadn't
<br>
opposed it, the Inter-allied Commission of mandates in
<br>
Turkey might have altered events back when.  But the
<br>
Report of American Section of Inter-Allied Commission
<br>
on Mandates in Turkey, August 28, 1919 was without
<br>
force or effect.  
<br>
<a href="http://www.ku.edu/~kansite/ww_one/docs/kncr.htm">http://www.ku.edu/~kansite/ww_one/docs/kncr.htm</a>
<br>
Whatever chance it might have had to effect world
<br>
events, evaporated when Woodrow Wilson stroked out on
<br>
Oct 3, 1919. Wilson proposed the Inter-Allied
<br>
commission to visit the Middle East to determine what
<br>
the people living there wanted: independence,
<br>
supervision under the proposed League of Nations
<br>
Mandate system, or other proposals.    
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; most noitable  and recently the parcelling up of
</em><br>
<p>by the way, in the above line I meant to write &quot;most
<br>
notably and recently&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; the Mideast by the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Europeans (primarily the Brits) after the defeat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the Ottomans . [etc]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The long list of bad events you mention happened
</em><br>
<em>&gt; centuries ago, and measured
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against the historic scale of human evil none of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; them rank very high,
</em><br>
<p>This is a pretty shabby argument.  
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;There are greater evils in the world, so 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;lesser&quot; evils, despite contemporary consequences 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;and victims, should be given a pass?  
<br>
<p>I don't think you really want to try and make that
<br>
fly.
<br>
It would be like saying &quot;The 911 attacks killed only
<br>
3000 people.  Historically, comparatively, that's
<br>
nothing!  Fugeddabowdit!&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; certainly not enough to account for their vast rage.
</em><br>
<p>From your point of view.  The aggrieved parties may
<br>
feel differently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Nothing on you list
</em><br>
<em>&gt; comes close to what the Jews experienced,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and far
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more recently too.
</em><br>
<p>The holocaust, right?  Another disjoint argument. A
<br>
distraction.  First, the offenses against the Arabs
<br>
pre-date the holocaust.  Secondly the Arabs weren't
<br>
responsible for the holocaust.  And finally, it's
<br>
ludicrous to suggest that post-holocaust sympathy for
<br>
the Jews somehow provides cover for the separate
<br>
misdeeds of another time and place.  And if perchance
<br>
the jews were partially involved in the perpetration
<br>
of those misdeeds, committed against separate and
<br>
innocent persons on another part of the planet, are
<br>
you suggesting that post-holocaust sympathy gives them
<br>
a free pass?  That's whee this line of justification
<br>
leads.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stuff that happened to Islam is just the sort of hum
</em><br>
<em>&gt; drum evil that happens
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in history, nothing special.
</em><br>
<p>I see.  Hum drum evil.  The kind you just sort of
<br>
ignore.  Hmmmm.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;And finally, the jewel in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; crown, the poison pill, the knife in the back (or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; perhaps I should say the ice pick in the face) of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; deliberate, overt, unashamed, and unrelenting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;erasure&quot; of Palestine and ethnic cleansing of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Palestinians, accompanied by their replacement by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ultra-aggressive, ultra-militaristic(which is to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; threatening), and ultra-contemptuous  Jewish state
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've said several times that it's a mistake to treat
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Israel like the 51's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; state, but to say that the reason Muslims in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indonesia hate the USA more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than they love life is because America supports a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nation who harmed a people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; who speak a different language, live 10,000 miles
</em><br>
<em>&gt; away and who they've never
</em><br>
<em>&gt; seen is ridiculous. Most Indonesian Muslims wouldn't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize a Palestinian
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if he tripped over him.
</em><br>
<p>Fine.  Glad to agree.  Let's leave Indonesia out of
<br>
it.  Pakistan to Morocco then?
<br>

<p>&quot;No drug, not even alcohol, causes the fundamental
<br>
ills of society. If we're looking for the sources of
<br>
our troubles, we shouldn't test people for drugs, we
<br>
should test them for stupidity, ignorance, greed and
<br>
love of power.&quot; - P. J. O'Rourke
