It seems like in investing as horse racing, recent data points should be
<br>
higher in value than events which took place longer ago.  For example a
<br>
stock or horses recent performance should be a better indicator of
<br>
future performance than how it ran two years ago.
<br>
<p>Is there any theory on the correct incorporation of weighting for the
<br>
temporal data in the model creation.  I think that ignoring the temporal
<br>
aspect of the data series is why many models fail.

<p>Good. You are thinking correctly here. You can use one set to
<br>
&quot;curve-fit&quot; the data, and another set to test your curve-fit to
<br>
determine whether it persists through time. No real need for a third set
<br>
of data. It is important that your test be for statistical significance
<br>
rather than only for profit/loss. If you don't know stat then you should
<br>
learn it. The basic tests are not too complicated.

<p>In the early 80's I made my living counting cards at the blackjack
<br>
tables in Reno and Las Vegas. I played cards for an entire year, seven
<br>
days per week. It was my business. In fact I decided to become an
<br>
investment advisor while sitting at a blackjack table in Reno. I was
<br>
ahead for the night by about $5,000. The dealer asked me what I would do
<br>
with my winnings if I were to win $50,000. I said, &quot;Well, I guess I
<br>
would invest it in the stockmarket.&quot; The dealer asked if I knew anything
<br>
about the market. I answered, &quot;No, not really, but now that you mention
<br>
it I really think I should learn about the stockmarket. I think I would
<br>
be good at it.&quot;  I went home and started studying to get my series 7
<br>
general securities broker license. The rest is history. I was a broker
<br>
for 12 years.
<br>
<p>Blackjack is the only beatable game in the casino, so don't waste your
<br>
time trying to find gambling systems for other games. Even blackjack is
<br>
difficult now as the casinos have become wise to card-counting. Even
<br>
back then, 20 years ago, I was barred from playing cards in six casinos.
<br>
The casino bosses would tap me on the shoulder and say &quot;Excuse me, sir,
<br>
but we have decided that we no longer wish to have you as a blackjack
<br>
customer. You're welcome to play slots or craps or any other game but
<br>
blackjack.&quot; They're even tougher now than they were then. In fact it is
<br>
almost impossible now even to find a beatable game; the pit bosses and
<br>
some of the dealers are trained in card-counting so they can detect it
<br>
more easily and evict the counters before they make any money. They also
<br>
shuffle early and use other tactics to thwart the counters.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned my statistical project these days is horse racing. I read
<br>
an interesting research report in a statistics journal about an apparent
<br>
inefficiency in paramutual betting at the track: it seems that the most
<br>
boring and conservative bets, (show bets on heavy favorites), have
<br>
bigger pay-offs than they should have in an efficient market for bets.
<br>
The statistics suggest that novices tend to bet on long shots for the
<br>
sheer thrill and entertainment value, creating an opportunity for
<br>
professionals to make a profit on the favorites.
