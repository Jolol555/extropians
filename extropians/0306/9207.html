</em><br>
<em>&gt; may not be everything, but it goes a long, long way.
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I'm pretty sure he wasn't making an intellectual statement.  I think he was
<br>
using a common idiom that expresses gratitude and humility at finding
<br>
himself in such a special situation and helps establish rapport with his
<br>
audience.  In the US, exceptionally bright children are generally referred
<br>
to as &quot;gifted&quot; (implying a giver?), so perhaps we are accustomed to hearing
<br>
it that way and it doesn't carry the same connotations as it does to you.
<br>
<p>When I was about seven or eight, I began to think about the many logical
<br>
inconsistencies in popular religious thinking and spent the next several
<br>
years trying to enlighten others by showing them where they were Wrong.  To
<br>
my frequent surprise and consternation, there was no apparent benefit from
<br>
these efforts.  I didn't change anyone's mind, and oddly, they seemed less
<br>
interested in discussing *anything* with me after I tried to help them see
<br>
the light.  Over the years I went through various phases of
<br>
(mis)understanding the situation, all having to do with the way I thought
<br>
things should be, and how if only other people would see it correctly, we
<br>
could make wonderful progress scientifically improving the human situation.
<br>
<p>Somewhere between then and now, my viewpoint has broadened.  I still
<br>
devoutly believe in the power of scientific thought and methods and I'm
<br>
highly motivated to spread the word of the power of Rational Thinking as
<br>
widely as possible.  However, my experience has been that for most effective
<br>
transfer of ideas, we must first establish some ideas in common and then
<br>
work together on refining differences in terms of common goals.  Also, I
<br>
became aware that some intelligent and rational people occasionally use the
<br>
term &quot;god&quot; as a metaphor for some undefined higher power or the laws of
<br>
physics (known and not yet known) with respect to which they genuinely feel
<br>
humble.
<br>
<p>I agree with you about the metaphorical term being an enabler of false or
<br>
fuzzy thinking, and I would seldom, if ever, use the term this way,
<br>
especially among extropians, unless for poetic, or other evocotive or
<br>
connotative purpose.  Regarding your point that metaphorical use can be seen
<br>
as a &quot;vote&quot; for the other side of this war of beliefs, I suppose you're
<br>
right, but when I weigh this against all the other areas that could be
<br>
addressed to help educate people to rational thinking, this just doesn't
<br>
seem worth fighting over.
<br>
<p>To me, &quot;seeing the bigger picture&quot; means recognizing that, especially when
<br>
dealing with people, the problem is often multidimensional, and the path to
<br>
a long term solution is rarely a linear extrapolation of what appears to be
<br>
the immediate solution.

<p><p><em>&gt; At best, this is disingenuous.  At worst, the metaphorer becomes an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;enabler&quot; (to use the parlance of the new psychobabble).  Maybe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that's one of the reasons United States denizens are far behind in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intellectual maturity when it comes to confronting the material world
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - they're intellectually lazy due to the mollycoddling that's been
</em><br>
<em>&gt; done by those-who-know-better but insist on acting paternalistically.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We have groups like the Boy Scouts who outrightly discriminate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against gays and nontheists.  We have a Christian fundamentalist
</em><br>
<em>&gt; president.  We have an attorney general who practices speaking in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tongues.  Is this not - at the very least - like, embarrasing?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Okay, whoever is responsible for bringing the &quot;bigger picture&quot; into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus ... step on it!  (please)
