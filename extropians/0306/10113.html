<br>
First, if you're going to post surrah's, post the surrah/verse numbers
<br>
:)
<br>
That way I can read it in its original and respond within the context
<br>
the surrah provides....
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Second, the major theme of the koran, indeed the overriding theme,
<br>
is attack only when someone attacks you or your faith; the main
<br>
exception
<br>
being the execution of prisoners found guilty by a preponderance of
<br>
doubt.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Thirdly, in relation to the treatment of Jews and Christians, vs
<br>
Muslims, vs Pagans,
<br>
there is a clear preference for Muslims to marry muslims;  however, in
<br>
failing
<br>
to find a muslim wife (or husband) that is suitable, you should marry
<br>
from the
<br>
Peoples of the Book (Jews and Christians), followed lastly by the
<br>
marriage to
<br>
Pagans.  The primary reason this is proscribed is because of the
<br>
confusion it
<br>
causes in children from dual-religion backgrounds.  As to out and out
<br>
killing
<br>
jews and christians solely because of their choice in faith, that is not
<br>
<p>condoned within the Koran.  You may however, defend your faith from
<br>
slander,
<br>
and defend yourself, your family, and your fellow muslims from physical
<br>
attack
<br>
or harm at the hands of others.  In point of fact, aside from the surrah
<br>
of
<br>
which I quoted originally &quot;kil u ayuhah al kafaroon&quot; explicitly protects
<br>
religious freedom, and the only permitted discrimination on non-muslim
<br>
believers is
<br>
the levy of an additional tax; The reason for that tax is that Muslims
<br>
(under an islamic
<br>
govt) all contribute roughly 10% of their income to the poor as a form
<br>
of welfare.
<br>
And given that it is a religious tithe, rather than a government one, a
<br>
tax is imposed
<br>
on non-Muslims to compensate; in effect, they're forced to kick in as
<br>
well.
<br>
There are volumes written about what is permissible and not permissible,
<br>
and
<br>
a complete legal system derived from the Koran and other 'sacred'
<br>
sources,
<br>
and how non-Muslims should be treated in relation to the Shuria.   The
<br>
other major
<br>
difference, from an economic standpoint, is that of the prohibition on
<br>
interest.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And speaking spiritually, the reason for the preference for 
<br>
Jews and Christians is clear; we're technically worshipping the 
<br>
same monotheistic god (versus the pagans, who of course, generally
<br>
speaking, violate the one god belief).  Pretty much the only difference
<br>
is that Christians think Jesus was the son of god, and both Jews and
<br>
Christians refuse to recognize mohammed as a prophet.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
And just to reel this all back in, the only duty a muslim has to a
<br>
non-muslim
<br>
is to inform him that there is one god, named allah and mohammed was his
<br>
<p>messenger.  After that, any failure to convert (ergo recognize the one
<br>
true god)
<br>
is a failure on your part, and you are judged accordingly.  Anyone who
<br>
has not
<br>
heard the call of Islam, is not responsible for his lack of recognition
<br>
for the message,
<br>
and is judged based on his actions, and not any of the specific
<br>
performances required
<br>
that form the five pillars of Islam (e.g. how kind they've been).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There's your religion of &quot;violence, religious suppression and
<br>
terrorism&quot;.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My advice, leave them alone, they're on a *completely* different trip
<br>
than
<br>
westerners.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Oh, and for your wonderful comment about discrimination, why don't you
<br>
go check
<br>
out mecca; there's 0 racial problems there, EVERYBODY is equal,
<br>
regardless of race,
<br>
caste or social status.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
omard-out
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
BTW - I'm leaving for a trip tomorrow, so we're going to have to finish
<br>
up this
<br>
discussion by tomorrow (Sunday, 12pm EST).
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p><em>    &gt;freedom of religion is gauranteed under the Koran
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>Like all sacred texts the Koran is full of contradictions, if you look
<br>
<p>hard enough you can find some nice warm inoffensive platitudes in it,
<br>
<p>but I don't see how you can say it GUARANTEES religious freedom
<br>
<p>when these gems are also in the book:
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;Strongest among men in enmity to the Believers will you find the 
<br>
<p>Jews and Pagans&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;fight and slay the pagans wherever you find them. And seize them, 
<br>
<p>beleaguer them and lie in wait for them.&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;Those that make war against God and His apostle and spread disorder 
<br>
<p>in the land shall be slain or crucified or have their hands and feet cut
<br>
<p><p>off on alternate sides, or be banished from the land&quot; 
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;make war on the unbelievers and the hypocrites and deal rigorously 
<br>
<p>with them. Hell shall be their home: an evil fate.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;Believers, take neither the Jews nor the Christians for your friends.&quot; 
<br>
<p><p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;When the sacred months are over slay the idolaters wherever you 
<br>
<p>find them. Arrest them, besiege them, and lie in ambush everywhere
<br>
<p>for them.&quot;
<br>
<p>&nbsp;
<br>
<p>&quot;When you meet the unbelievers in the battlefield strike off their 
<br>
<p>heads and, when you have laid them low, bind your captives firmly. 
<br>
<p>Then grant them their freedom or take a ransom from them&quot; 
<br>
