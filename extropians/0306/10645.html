<em>&gt; I would like to inform you of an event that you may
</em><br>
<em>&gt; find of great value. On
</em><br>
<em>&gt; behalf of NCnano, The Northern California
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nanotechnology Initiative, you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are invited to attend the first in a series of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Nanotechnology Leadership
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Conferences focusing on commercializing emerging
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technologies intellectual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; property. The subject of this conference is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;Transforming Bay Area
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nanotechnology, infrastructure and entrepreneurism
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into companies, jobs and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regional economic growth.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>Some random comments from having attended the event:
<br>
<p>The field in question is defined as the fusion of
<br>
biotech, infotech, and (very primitive Drexlerian)
<br>
nanotech proper.  The fusion itself has no single word
<br>
name yet.  If you know just one field, learn a second:
<br>
infotech plus nanotech equals embedded systems,
<br>
infotech plus biotech equals bioinformations and
<br>
*omics, biotech plus nanotech equals biogadgets.  Put
<br>
together, one could say BIN is the modern industrial
<br>
answer to military/anti-terrorist ABC worries as the
<br>
big thing to ponder.  Then again, it covers so many
<br>
things that, for most new and strange ideas, one could
<br>
probably toss it somewhere in the BIN.
<br>
<p>They needed to allow more time for networking.  Most
<br>
of
<br>
the participants seemed to get the most value from the
<br>
networking.  NCnano is even trying to get a database
<br>
of
<br>
all the prospective players in this field together, so
<br>
they can play nonprofit matchmaker.  Then again, I
<br>
suppose they did have to let their guest speakers
<br>
(those who paid for the gathering?) speak.
<br>
<p>2 hours for 11 presentations is not enough.  (That one
<br>
guy from NEC went on and on and on...)  Especially in
<br>
the buyers' market of BIN intellectual property, when
<br>
most of the presenters seemed to be sellers
<br>
desperately
<br>
looking for buyers.  (References kept being made to
<br>
&quot;the people with money in the audience&quot;, of whom
<br>
everyone was sure there were some but not quite who or
<br>
how many.  A random sample of companies represented,
<br>
by glancing at company names on name badges as I
<br>
walked
<br>
around, failed to turn up any venture capital firms I
<br>
recognized.  Even so, margin of error says there may
<br>
have been a few, but it seems unlikely there were
<br>
many.
<br>
If someone wants to run the probabilities, I think I
<br>
scanned about 5% of the crowd between conversations
<br>
during the networking pre- and post-speeches.)
<br>
<p>Amusing (to me, anyway) personal bit: almost everyone
<br>
seemed to be representing this or that company or
<br>
institution, usually involving a formal research lab.
<br>
I represented myself.  Yet more than one attendee said
<br>
I was basically on equal footing with them as far as
<br>
involvement in the field: have some IP, trying but not
<br>
yet succeeding to commercialize it.  Granted, they're
<br>
way beyond me in many significant areas, but one would
<br>
think they could move to the next step faster than a
<br>
single individual.  Especially since, as was pointed
<br>
out, developing this stuff in one's garage is almost
<br>
impossible.  (Depending on the exact thing you're
<br>
developing, anyway.  For instance, there are
<br>
email-order rent-a-fabs out there, operating much like
<br>
vanity presses but without the vanity.)
