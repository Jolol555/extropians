<p><p>Beautiful vision. A preliminary stage of that goal would be a kind of
<br>
virtual riding out before breakfast which has always been one of my
<br>
favourite dreams. To log in the cameras of different satellites, to inspect
<br>
my favourite places on the planet, to float calmly over the Aegean Sea and
<br>
beckon the ships over, pilot them generously through the strait of Corinth
<br>
with a wave of my hand and switch to another satellite camera that zooms to
<br>
the peak of Mount Everest where I can see the last steps of a roped party in
<br>
high resolution.
<br>
<p>I would not be interested in real omniscience though. I would rather call it
<br>
a kind of *omni part taking* without the intention to rule over situations
<br>
or people, an anarchical observer state in the Kantian sense of
<br>
&quot;interesselosem Wohlgefallen&quot; (indifferent pleasure).
<br>
<p>The abuse that arises in animal brains while being logged into trillions of
<br>
cameras is obvious. First we have to get rid of greed and lust for power.
<br>
And I believe, this state of mind is much harder to achieve than a first
<br>
class consciousness transfer or an omnipresent camera system. The
<br>
moral obligation to appease reptile and monkey layers in our brains
<br>
seems to be the more urgent task in my opinion.
