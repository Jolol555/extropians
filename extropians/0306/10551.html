<p>The key problem is that beliefs seem more local than biases.  It should
<br>
be easier to show you my current beliefs on a particular matter than to
<br>
show you the entire process that led to those beliefs.  I could hide my
<br>
bias in thousands of different places.  So either you need a global
<br>
analysis of all my thinking, to verify that the whole is unbiased.
<br>
Or you have to accept that you can see my beliefs but not my biases.
<br>
<p>This seems to suggest a discrete split in our futures.  Either agents,
<br>
or certain internal modules, are standardized enough to allow biases to
<br>
be checked, giving truly unbiased agents or modules, or biases are hard
<br>
to see but beliefs are not, so that agents self-deceive.
<br>
<p>To see that there really is a demand for such self-deception, let's
<br>
work through an example.  Let us say I know how much I really like my
<br>
girlfriend (x), and then I choose my new beliefs (y), under the
<br>
expectation that my girlfriend will then see those new beliefs, but not
<br>
any memory of this revision process.  (Of course it wouldn't really like
<br>
this; analyzing this is a simple way to see the tradeoffs.)
<br>
<p>I face a tradeoff.  The more confident I become I like her the worse my
<br>
future decisions will be (due to the difference y-x), but the more she
<br>
will be reassured of my loyalty (due to a high y).  The higher my x,
<br>
the higher a y I'm willing to choose in making this tradeoff.  So the
<br>
higher a y she sees, the higher an x she can infer.  So this is all
<br>
really costly signaling.
