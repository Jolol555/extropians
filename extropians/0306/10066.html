</em><br>
<p>I see your objection Robert.  The transition 
<br>
I have in mind will take twenty to twenty five 
<br>
years, longer than a typical wearout cycle 
<br>
of our modern detroits.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;&gt; This world cannot make any real 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;progress in energy production until we 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; burn up most of the reserves.  Cheapy 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;oil is holding back progress.
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt;Granted -- because we have had ~100 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;years to develop the infrastructure that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;depends on oil and gas.  So everything 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that is involved is inexpensive at
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this time.  But there is no (significant) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;infrastructure to produce fuel
</em><br>
<em>&gt;cells that consume hydrogen.
</em><br>
<p>Ja, I don't really have fuel cells in mind, 
<br>
but rather good old fashioned series hybrid 
<br>
cars.  All that infrastructure can be 
<br>
harnessed to build fully automated factories 
<br>
that assemble small internal combustion 
<br>
engines and electric motors for much cheaper 
<br>
than our current detroits.  We thus provide 
<br>
the technology to allow developing nations 
<br>
to leapfrog the expensive development 
<br>
architectures, analogous to the way the 
<br>
developed world now provides cell phone 
<br>
tech that allows developing nations to 
<br>
jump straight to cheap and effective 
<br>
communications tech.
<br>
<p>Series hybrids have another benefit in that 
<br>
they can be effectively controlled
<br>
externally, allowing smart roads to take the 
<br>
wheel and the brake, allowing cars to be 
<br>
operated at a distance of about a meter 
<br>
spacing, which reduces air resistance.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  There are no pipelines to move hydrogen 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;around the country.
</em><br>
<p>Ja, and I would never recommend such a thing.  
<br>
If hydrogen is needed for some purpose, the 
<br>
way to move it is by copper wire pushing the 
<br>
energy around in the form of good old fashioned 
<br>
electricity, then cracking water at the site.  
<br>
That being said, I doubt that hydrogen is the 
<br>
way to handle energy.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  There are power lines to move electricity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; around but you, I think, would be one of the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; first to recognize that even that system can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; break down when prices spike...
</em><br>
<p>Sure, but free markets and decentralized 
<br>
generation solve those kinds of problems.  
<br>
Electricity production can be highly 
<br>
decentralized.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;the question I'm trying to focus on is &quot;How much &gt;do we get set back if
</em><br>
we hit the wall hard?&quot;
<br>
<p>We don't hit the wall hard.  That paper 
<br>
you cited goes on about peaking production, 
<br>
but the worst that happens is that we have 
<br>
no more production than the previous year.  
<br>
This isn't really hitting the wall hard.  
<br>
Its more just needing to develop alternatives, 
<br>
or rather gradually making existing alternatives 
<br>
more attractive.
<br>
<p>One seldom-mentioned advantage of so many 
<br>
Westerners driving SUVs and oversized trucks 
<br>
is that we have so much inherent potential 
<br>
to cut back on consumption without seriously 
<br>
impacting our lives.  If fuel ever gets 
<br>
expensive, a lot of us could park our 
<br>
guzzlers and buy dinkymobiles.  
<br>
<p>What if we all already had dinkymobiles?  
<br>
Then we really would hit the wall, eh?  Its 
<br>
like the disadvantage of living a clean 
<br>
healthy lifestyle:  one day you find yourself 
<br>
in the hospital dying of nothing.  You have 
<br>
no bad habits to give up, you're just hosed.  
<br>
We have bad habits to give up.  We hold them 
<br>
in reserve.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Give me an estimate of how many years you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt;it would take to replace every gasoline fueled
</em><br>
<em>&gt;vehicle in the country with a battery powered 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;electrical vehicle?
</em><br>
<p>Twenty years.  Twenty five tops.  Furthermore 
<br>
we do not need to replace *every* detroit.  
<br>
80 percent would be enough.  In the mean time, 
<br>
having large vehicles on the roads has encouraged 
<br>
us to build really enormous really good roads.  
<br>
Then when we scale back down, think how wonderfully 
<br>
adequate those roads will be for all the dinky 
<br>
little cars.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  And then estimate the hit to the economy while
</em><br>
<em>&gt;that process takes place and everyone is spending
</em><br>
<em>&gt;time and money fueling their obsolete vehicles in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a situation that may resemble the oil shortages
</em><br>
<em>&gt;during the '70s.
</em><br>
<p>Granted there will be some pain.  But we are 
<br>
a strong and clever species, and AI research 
<br>
will go on I can assure you.  Compared to the 
<br>
70s, we have far better infrastructure to move 
<br>
bits instead of butts.  I have noticed in my own 
<br>
field that faaar more work can be conducted over 
<br>
phonelines and optical fibers than was possible 
<br>
even 10 years ago.  
<br>
<p>Three key tools have come along since the 70s, 
<br>
and it makes me a bit squirmy to realize 
<br>
Microsloth owns two of them: Powerpoint, 
<br>
Excel and email.  Powerpoint alone has obviated 
<br>
much cross-country travel in the rocket science 
<br>
business: you email your sales pitch to the 
<br>
customer, then pitch it via videophone.  No 
<br>
plane ticket, no hotel, ahhh life is goooood.  
<br>
Excel of course is the greatest engineering 
<br>
tool ever invented.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Spike -- I'd suggest you might be riding your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; motorcycle a bit less when fuel for it costs
</em><br>
<em>&gt; $10.00/gallon...  Robert
</em><br>
<p>Well, more actually, since they get 40 miles 
<br>
per gallon, which is about 18 km/liter.  {8-]  
<br>
<p>Robert my old pal, do not lose your courage.  
<br>
We are standing on the threshold of a dream.  
<br>
We are truly on the eve of construction.
