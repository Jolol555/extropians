<p>'Matos' trial made national headlines because of a so-called black box
<br>
inside the his car that provided perhaps the most damaging evidence in
<br>
the case. The black box, a computer which is included in some Ford and
<br>
GM cars and records vehicle conditions, indicated that Matos was
<br>
traveling more than 100 mph down a residential street seconds before the
<br>
crash.'
<br>
<p><p>This is the ideal use of car black box recorders. If you are doing 114
<br>
mph down a residential street, you can no longer claim that it was just
<br>
another accident. This guy got the maximum 30 years sentence after
<br>
killing two teenagers.
<br>
<p><p>I didn't know these boxes were already being fitted in US cars so I
<br>
asked Lord Google.

<br>
<p>'Black boxes have been in all GM cars since 1999 and in many other makes
<br>
and models since 1996. (See the links below to see if your car comes
<br>
standard with one.)'
<br>
<p><a href="http://drive.fairfax.com.au/content-new/news/features/2003/06/16/FFXA42ZCZGD.html">http://drive.fairfax.com.au/content-new/news/features/2003/06/16/FFXA42ZCZGD.html</a>
<br>
And in Australian cars also.
<br>
<p>So it seems that a LOT of cars have these fitted nowadays. And the
<br>
police are allowed to read them after an accident. As more drivers come
<br>
to realize that somebody is watching them all the time then you would
<br>
expect either safer driving behavior or more reckless drivers behind bars.
