<br>
<p>I spend a lot of time writing about science and technology, and my general 
<br>
thrust has been one of promoting and defending science and technology. By most 
<br>
standards, I am a technophile. Yet I find myself concerned by some of the 
<br>
commentary presented by my fellow technophiles in various forums. In particular, 
<br>
they (or we, because I don't think I'm immune to these tendencies) tend to take 
<br>
expansive views about technology's potential to transform humanity and the 
<br>
world, even when there is vast uncertainty about what that potential is. 
<br>
<p>My concerns crystallized after I read Arnold Kling's TCS article &quot; which 
<br>
argued that the march of technology is rapidly making the work of humanists 
<br>
(experts on literature, philosophy and so on) irrelevant and obsolete. I debated 
<br>
Kling in a few comments posted below his article, and the debate soon focused on 
<br>
questions about technology and the Vietnam War. 
<br>
<p>But my broader objections were to the triumphal and sweeping tenor of his 
<br>
article. In subsequent weeks, Kling has written several TCS pieces on current 
<br>
issues in health care and education - and I have been tempted to post comments 
<br>
asking why we should worry about such pedestrian issues, given that technology 
<br>
is about to transform humanity anyway. (I decided to avoid such petty sniping, 
<br>
of course.) 
<br>
<p>Speculating about the future of technology is part of any technophile 
<br>
commentator's job description. But when technophiles assert, confidently and without 
<br>
caveats, that vast change is in the offing, several dangers arise. One is that 
<br>
technophobes will get undeserved material for presenting alarmist views, as 
<br>
has been occurring in the debate over human genetic engineering. Another 
<br>
concern is that overselling the product will lead to disappointment when the 
<br>
promised results don't arise, fueling further public disenchantment with technology. 
<br>
In addition, techno-hype can simply be a distraction when dealing with serious 
<br>
issues involving technology. 
<br>
<p>In light of all this, I would like to suggest some guidelines that could be 
<br>
helpful to technophiles in thinking and arguing about technology. These are 
<br>
heuristics to be considered, not inflexible principles, and they are reminders to 
<br>
myself as well as to others: 
<br>
<p>Extrapolate cautiously. The Wright brothers' original airplane in 1903 flew 
<br>
at about 30 miles per hour. Just under 50 years later, two military aircraft 
<br>
flew at over 1,600 miles per hour, more than twice the speed of sound. In the 
<br>
mid-1970s, the supersonic Concorde began flying commercially, and military jets 
<br>
pushed over Mach 3. Now, nearly 100 years after the first Wright flights, the 
<br>
top military speeds are stable, and the Concorde is being mothballed. The 
<br>
gains seen in the first half or three-quarters of the first century of flight 
<br>
would have been a poor predictor of where aviation would be in 2003. 
<br>
<p>Remember failed predictions. Numerous technologies have failed to live up to 
<br>
early expectations or speculations. Nuclear fusion and artificial intelligence 
<br>
both fall into that category. Some hoped-for technologies, such as flying 
<br>
cars or underwater cities, have failed to materialize at all. Meanwhile, the 
<br>
important technologies that have emerged often have done so with little 
<br>
expectation. In the late 1960s, the original Star Trek presented Ricardo Montalban's 
<br>
villain Khan as a product of &quot;selective breeding,&quot; rather than of the gene 
<br>
splicing that emerged as a real technique the following decade. 
<br>
<p>Think negatively sometimes. Economists are adept at considering costs and 
<br>
constraints. Physicists are good at it, too, being quick to notice, for example, 
<br>
when a proposed energy device violates the laws of thermodynamics. 
<br>
Speculations about future technologies become more credible when they take into account 
<br>
possible physical, economic, social or political hurdles to their 
<br>
actualization. Technologies also may carry crucial tradeoffs against other technologies or 
<br>
goals. Hydrogen fuel-cell cars and electric-battery cars are unlikely both to 
<br>
become major forms of transportation (even if either one ever does). 
<br>
<p>Consider low-tech options. Not everyone has the inclination or the means to 
<br>
be on the technological cutting edge. Being focused on technology, technophiles 
<br>
may overlook alternative methods that, for better or worse, might come into 
<br>
use. During the conflict in Somalia in the 1990s, U.S. intelligence efforts 
<br>
were frustrated by the enemy militias' use of low-powered radios (and lower-tech 
<br>
drums) invulnerable to satellite interception. 
<br>
<p>Visit Monument Valley. This scenic Arizona-Utah area of mesas and buttes is 
<br>
worth the trip. But it's also an interesting metaphor, as used by physicist 
<br>
James Trefil in his book Are We Unique?: A Scientist Explores the Unparalleled 
<br>
Intelligence of the Human Mind. Trefil argued that any future intelligent 
<br>
computers would likely be very different from humans; they might outthink us in some 
<br>
ways but fall short in others - much as Monument Valley's structures differ 
<br>
from each other, rather than being adequately ranked by height. The Monument 
<br>
Valley metaphor provides a valuable perspective on the possibility that genetic 
<br>
engineering or other techniques could create &quot;posthumans.&quot; But it's also a 
<br>
helpful way of thinking about technology in general. Innovations do not 
<br>
necessarily outperform, in every way, everything that came before. 
<br>
<p>Beware the horseshoe. It is sometimes suggested that the political spectrum 
<br>
is like a horseshoe, in which the extremes are much closer to each other than 
<br>
they are to the center. A similar argument could be made about the spectrum of 
<br>
opinion regarding technology. Among both technophiles and technophobes, there 
<br>
are fervent believers in the proposition that technology is about to radically 
<br>
change the world and humanity. The disagreement is mainly about whether this 
<br>
is a good thing. If you are a technophile who shares certain key assumptions 
<br>
with technophobes, that doesn't necessarily mean you and they are wrong in 
<br>
those assumptions. But it's a possibility you might want to consider.
