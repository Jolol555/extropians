</em><br>
<p>If this is true, then yes, coordinating toward truth is best.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;... can't people just not look at the prices? Most people never read

</em><br>
<p>Well there's always the approach where each person thinks he is helping to
<br>
fix the problem all those other people have, but not him.  This is in part
<br>
why people support paternalistic policies.  And as voters they mostly do not
<br>
support direct democracy, so they do feel they should defer on some issues.
<br>
But I agree that this is a serious challenge.
