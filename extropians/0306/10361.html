</em><br>
<p>Well let's first look at what was written.

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the moral culpability.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [PG:]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I was planning on releasing this to the press Monday morning, but....
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;President Bush.  It pleases me to inform you that you should abdicate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Your thron...OFFICE prior to the end of the week.  If you do so you will
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ensure that there is &quot;no senseless waste of time, energy, money,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; one drop of Blood being shed. If you do not vacate your office
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately, I (and history) will hold you morally culpabable.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>This defends Saddam, by saying that he is no worse than other
<br>
people.  (I will address later the degree to which we should
<br>
regard this as &quot;support&quot;.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Saddam invaded another country we agreed to defend...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Uh, just in case you didn't know, Kuwait was originally part of Iraq,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Like Sudan was part of Egypt.  In point of fact, Iraq refused to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; recognize Kuwait...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; So as far as I'm concerned, Saddam didn't invade anybody.  He was
</em><br>
<em>&gt; putting down a long-standing rebellion when the rebels invited in a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foreign power because they were scared of the consequences.
</em><br>
<p>This is not only defense, but definitely borders on support.
<br>
In an aside, the writer demeans those rebelling against Saddam,
<br>
by implying that their motives were not the best.
<br>
<p>The writer then does, however, go on to say
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This particular scene With foreign powers and psuedo independent
</em><br>
<em>&gt; states etc has been played out Repeatedly through history.  I can't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technically fault the man for his &quot;invasion&quot;;  Kuwait would have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; expanded his capabilities.  'course he got his butt spanked by
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The US, but that's another story.
</em><br>
<p>and a sympathetic reader may be entitled to wonder about how
<br>
much support there really is here.  But the previous quote
<br>
can stand, not unfairly, without this IMO.
<br>
<p>Eliezer continues
<br>
<p><em>&gt; He is pointing out that neither Saddam nor, for that matter, Bush,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are exceptional from a realpolitik view of world history.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not share that view of world history...
</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Paul Grant, though, is simply stepping back and viewing the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation as a realpolitik-oriented historian might view it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; had it occurred a hundred years ago.
</em><br>
<p>It seems to me that that's not all he was doing.  His orientation
<br>
was clearly to defend Saddam, though not nearly so clear to 
<br>
&quot;support&quot; Saddam I will admit.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; People in the grip of blind patriotism who will go to any lengths, however 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; irrational, to exalt Bush and vilify Iraq, will exaggerate the genuine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference that exists between the two, even though there is a genuine 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; difference.
</em><br>
<p>Very true ;-)  But logically, of course, it does not
<br>
follow that all who exalt Bush and vilify Saddam are
<br>
in the grip of the blind sort of patriotism!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No matter how evil Saddam is, it will always be possible to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paint a picture of him that is even more evil than the reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A scrupulous arguer must then attempt to dispel this picture,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and, I suppose, be accused of &quot;defending&quot; Saddam.
</em><br>
<p>That's exactly why lip service *at least* is called for:
<br>
perhaps you misunderstood my point about it.  What I 
<br>
meant to say was that if one will take just a moment
<br>
to deliver a recognition of the part of the truth in
<br>
others' arguments, then one may proceed with one's
<br>
own tirade without making the situation much worse.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Of course it may well be that [the writer], in the heat of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; bipolarized argument, went too far in arguing and tipped
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the scales the other way.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, rather clearly.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This should not be interpreted as any particular liking or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; support for Saddam, which is of course extremely unlikely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in terms of prior odds.
</em><br>
<p>But with no denial or criticism in evidence, it is not
<br>
unreasonable to suppose (or at least suggest) that the
<br>
bitter feelings of so many extreme partisans indeed 
<br>
result in that very thing you consider so unlikely.
<br>
<p>Suppose someone never criticized discrimination, never
<br>
said a harsh word about racists or racism, and invariably
<br>
pointed out that members of the KKK and other racists in
<br>
were not worse than many widely respected figures, and
<br>
that there were many historical precedents.  What would
<br>
you think?  What would you say?  Would you say that he
<br>
was not only defending racists, but supporting them?
