<p><p>Most cruise liners have casinos on board, though they generally are
<br>
only a small portion of the ship. There are also floating 'riverboats'
<br>
in places like the Mississippi that are little more than barges with
<br>
legislative protection rackets.
<br>
<p>I agree that a casino would definitely make it profitable, especially
<br>
functioning as a base of online gambling via satellite as well. I am
<br>
aware that Sean Hastings' &quot;Seastead&quot; project is also planning a similar
<br>
but more sedentary enterprise, anchored &gt;3mi off the coast of Gibraltar
<br>
in the med (Sean was CEO of HavenCo, BTW), so Harvey's pooh-poohing of
<br>
seaborne extropian projects is a bit tired. Patri Friedman, David's
<br>
son, is involved in that project as well.
<br>
<p>Any such project needs to be of sufficient size to allow it to service
<br>
a good number of customers to pay for the capital investment. The $4.5
<br>
mil (or $10 mil project cost) I project for the aircraft carrier is
<br>
generally in line with the cost of much smaller platforms with much
<br>
less maneuverability, range, versatility, and carrying capacity. If
<br>
they can put together viable business plans, then there is no reason at
<br>
all that the Vengance cannot be made even more profitable.
<br>
<p>Besides, the Vengance has something all these other projects will never
<br>
have: history. It IS a WWII relic that saw action. That gives it
<br>
tourist cachet like putting a casino in, say, Versailles Palace.
<br>
<p>Casinos are money machines. There is a reason the mafia are always
<br>
interested in getting involved in them, because it is so difficult to
<br>
lose money with them. An owner of a casino can basically bankroll
<br>
whatever agenda he or she desires...
