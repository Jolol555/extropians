<p>
Was browsing the stacks at Borders this evening after finding out that
<br>
not only was my special order for a used copy of &quot;Great Kings War&quot;
<br>
cancelled, but that they also cancelled my order for a couple different
<br>
S Andrew Swann's novels about Nohar Rajasthan.
<br>
<p>Found &quot;The Pocket Essential Cyberpunk&quot;, by Andrew M Butler, published
<br>
in 2000 in Britain by Pocket Essentials, in the US by Trafalgar Square
<br>
Publishing. ISBN 1-903047-28-5
<br>
<p>I came upon this pocket literature review and was intrigued to see what
<br>
they said about some particular SF writers I know. I must say that I
<br>
was disappointed. Absolutely no mention of Damien Broderick, not even a
<br>
mention of Vernor Vinge. Just who does the author think he is? Going
<br>
through the list of authors, the only ones I recognised were Gibson,
<br>
Sterling, Stephenson, Egan, and Greg Bear. GREG BEAR??? A cyberpunk
<br>
author?
<br>
<p>The author of this review also had the temerity to separate cyberpunk
<br>
into three categories: The Cyberpunk Movement, Post-Cyberpunk, and
<br>
Cyberpunk-Flavoured Fiction (Ah, I said, this guy is a brit, and as
<br>
such is about as in the know as the idiot brit who labeled the Grunge
<br>
movement).
<br>
<p>The author, Andrew M Butler, rightfully classifies Gibson and Sterling
<br>
as  the &quot;Core Reading&quot;. He includes Greg Bear solidly as part of the
<br>
Cyberpunk movement, though I've never read anything of his which I'd
<br>
classify as such, and the author only cites three of his works, and
<br>
only classifies Neil Stephenson as part of the post-cyberpunk era. Greg
<br>
Egan is in even worse shape. He is only 'cyberpunk flavoured fiction'. 
<br>
<p>Absolutely no mention of Vinge or Broderick. Can ya believe it?
<br>
<p>Authors the writer did mention (others are encouraged to comment on
<br>
these individuals):
<br>
<p>The Cyberpunk Movement:
<br>
Pat Cardigan
<br>
Marc Lailaw
<br>
Tom Maddox
<br>
Rudy Rucker (have heard of him)
<br>
Lewis Shiner
<br>
John Shirley
<br>
<p>Post-Cyberpunk:
<br>
Wilhemina Baird
<br>
Bruce Bethke
<br>
Simon Ings
<br>
Richard Kadrey
<br>
Kim Newman
<br>
Marge Piercy
<br>
Justina Robson
<br>
<p>Cyberpunk-Flavoured Fiction:
<br>
Jon Courtenay Grimwood (have seen his stuff in the stacks)
<br>
Gwyneth Jones
<br>
Shariann Lewitt
<br>
Jeff Noon
<br>
Tricia Sullivan
<br>
Jack Womack
<br>
<p>Films: 
<br>
This guy also thinks he is a cyberpunk film reviewer. Unfortunately, he
<br>
doesn't seem to be able to tell the difference between a cyberpunk film
<br>
and a non-cyberpunk film. I mean, he thinks that Run Lola Run and
<br>
Terminator II are cyberpunk films. While he makes a short comment about
<br>
films like Hackers, The Net, and Sneakers featuring hackers as
<br>
characters, he doesn't review these films, and he leaves out entirely
<br>
seminal early works like Tron. Johnny Mnemonic he entirely fails to
<br>
credit the writer whose work the movie is based on.
<br>
<p>Conclusion:
<br>
Butler should stick to other pursuits. Producing an Essential Guide of
<br>
any sort doesn't seem to be his forte.
