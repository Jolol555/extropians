<em>  &gt; At first MEZ gave his advice because he was a middle easterner and therefore held special expertise.  Now he is a poor Egyptian Christian that hasn't been in the country since he was 3 years old.  At first he lambasted the US and its policies, now he is a loyal American and I mustn't criticize him.  Frankly, I am confused.  It is like listening to a windshield wiper -- flip, flop, flip, flop.  Only one thing is consistant with him, everything he says is detrimental to our country, IMHO.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Lambasting&quot; US policies and being a loyal American are not mutually exclusive.  And why do you make things up? (Mez never said you mustn't criticize him).  In fact, if you don't understand this basic right we Americans have (these days, I feel I need to add: &quot;at least for now&quot;), i.e., that we CAN speak our minds, and we CAN criticize our government if we feel something may be awry (even if our concerns are eventually proved wrong), and that a lot of people died to ensure this privilege, then I would impute that it is you who may not understand what America is supposed to be all about.   If we lose our freedom of speech entitlement (with the necessary exceptions like &quot;yelling fire in a crowded movie house&quot;), we just may be going the way of those very countries you criticize for being so unlike us.  How sadly ironic that would be.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;However, I do agree with you about one thing - you do sound like you're confused.
