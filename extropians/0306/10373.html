<p>Evolution seems to have discovered differently.  It has not given us the
<br>
habit of thought of having accurate estimates and then sometimes lying
<br>
about them.  People seem to more often honestly believe what they tell
<br>
their girlfriends, but to honestly believe things that are biased.  In
<br>
the moment he says that he loves only her, that she is the only person
<br>
for him, and that he will always want her, he believes it.  But he
<br>
consistently over-estimates all this.  The same goes for patriotism, the
<br>
topic that started this thread.  Most people seem to honestly believe
<br>
that their country is better than other ones; it is not that they really
<br>
think otherwise but lie when asked about their country.
