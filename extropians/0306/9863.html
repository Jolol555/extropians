<em>&gt;Amara,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Have you noticed we haven't carpet bombed Iraq with cluster bombs.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;Cluster bombs like any other weapon are intended for specific targets.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;We haven't had those targets and hence have not used the weapons.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;You've been listening to the Hate America First crowd again.

<p><p>The lethal detritus of war
<br>
<p>Unexploded bombs are still killing
<br>
a great many people in Iraq
<br>
<p>The Economist May 10, 2003
<br>
Pg. 38-39
<br>
<p>The newest cluster bombs sound too good to be true. Small bomblets
<br>
emerge from their casing as they hurtle towards the earth, whereupon
<br>
sensors guide them to tanks and other targets, as mini-parachutes
<br>
slow their descent. If the bomblets fail to find something suitable to
<br>
destroy, they automatically self-destruct.
<br>
<p>Too good to be true, indeed. Even some of the newest bomblets deployed
<br>
by American and Britain have malfunctioned, says the Mines Advisory
<br>
Group (MAG)(, which is working to clear up unexploded ordnance in
<br>
northern Iraq. Along with the rest of the detritus of war - bomblets
<br>
from older devices, Iraqi landmines left over from successive
<br>
conflicts, and vast stockpiles of abandoned weapons left unguarded by
<br>
Iraq's new occupiers - they are killing and maiming those unfortunate
<br>
enough to stumble upon them.
<br>
<p>These casualties tend to peak in the weeks after a war, explains
<br>
Richard Lloyd, of Landmine Action, a campaign group, as people return
<br>
to places that they had wrongly assumed to be safe. Sean Sutton, of
<br>
MAG, says that there have been hundreds of casualties in the north
<br>
since the hostilities ceased, around half of which have been children.
<br>
Landmines, trickier to spot than cluster bomblets -- are the biggest
<br>
problem, though the latter's shiny casing fatally attracts youngsters.
<br>
<p>Cluster bombs have a long and controversial history. Most of the
<br>
individual bomblets -- dozens or hundreds of which are contained in
<br>
each bomb -- fall haphazardly over wide areas, and some fail to
<br>
explode; the self-destruct mechanisms on the newer models have reduced
<br>
the risk, but not entirely. Advocates argues that the weapons are
<br>
useful against broad targets, such as runways, armoured columns and
<br>
troop concentrations. America says it dropped 1500 of the things in
<br>
Iraq for these purposes.
<br>
<p>Human Rights Watch, a lobby group, says that the figure is misleading,
<br>
because it does not include munitions fired from the ground. America
<br>
admits to using them in civilian areas, but says they struck only 26
<br>
targets within 1500 feet of civilian neighbourhoods. For their part,
<br>
the British fired around 2000 cluster bombs from the ground, and the
<br>
Royal Air Force dropped another 65, mostly around Basra.
<br>
<p>America Britain both say that they will help to clear up the deadly
<br>
mess they have left, but others say they have been slow in disclosing
<br>
what they dropped and where. The question remains whether the use of
<br>
cluster bombs, old or new, in civilian districts, violates the rules
<br>
of war.
