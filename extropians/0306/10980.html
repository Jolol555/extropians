<p>
Personally, I've been finding continuing thinking on the nature of
<br>
consciousness quite unsettling. The problem is as follows:
<br>
<p>Axiom: I am.
<br>
Tenuous hypothesis 1: I have sensory input implying other stuff, and so it
<br>
is too.
<br>
Tenuous hypothesis 2: I am part of the set of other stuff. 
<br>
<p>(much deduction, investigation, leading to negation of concept of conscious
<br>
self; self is an illusion, &quot;I&quot; am just a pattern of information)
<br>
<p>I find that if I take Tenuous Hypotheses 1 &amp; 2 as axioms, I produce the
<br>
result:
<br>
<p>Result: I am not.
<br>
<p>By my original axiom, I now have A and ~A. I've just flushed reality down
<br>
the toilet. What is existence?
<br>
<p>I can't fault the materialist viewpoint, because I can't support the
<br>
alternative; the closer I look, the more it appears that there is no
<br>
possible role at all for any proposed non-physical piece of consciousness.
<br>
So intelligent thought is a purely physical phenomenon, about information
<br>
processing. Which means that &quot;I&quot; am not; &quot;I&quot; am an illusion (fooling who?
<br>
what?).
<br>
<p>I can only find paradox at the base of any search for an explanation of the
<br>
only phenomenon in the universe that I can definitely call axiomatic (that I
<br>
am). To me, it is more clearly evident than the existence of anything else.
<br>
But apparently it cannot be true. 
<br>
<p>Help.
<br>

<em>&gt; &gt; Of course it is correct that we do not yet know as much as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we should on brain and consciousness. At the same time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the point that I am trying to make is independent of a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular mechanism of consciousness:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Question A: does the uploaded copy of person X wake up
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; thinking and feeling that (s)he is X? Does (s)he feel continuity
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; with X (going to sleep - waking up)?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes and yes. Assuming, as we have been, that the upload works.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Indeed the test of whether the upload has worked is likely to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; does Xprime think (s)he is X and does everyone else relate to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Xprime as X.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This is a scientific question that can be answered with a simple
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; experiment: just ask the uploaded copy of X. I assume the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; answer depends on the details of a uploading technology, like
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; how much and what kind of information it is able to copy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; restore. I think this technology is a few decades away at least,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but it seems reasonable to think that it will be developed sooner
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or later.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Well, the uploading technology is unlikely to be *built* until it can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be designed. Seems we are unlikely to be satisfied with the design
</em><br>
<em>&gt; until we have a better understanding of what we take for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;consciousness&quot; and the &quot;self&quot;. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Question B: assuming that the answer to Question A is yes (the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uploaded copy feels that (s)he is X), is (s)he REALLY X?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This does not look like a scientific question, since its formulation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is such that it cannot be verified or falsified. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Agreed. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Goedel's Incompleteness Theorem:  There are certain propositions
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are true that cannot be proven.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think the consciousness of any other person you know
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is a scientifically veriable hypothesis? I think it can only 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be inferred.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Do you think your own is even to you? I think it can only be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; assumed.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Without assuming it you have *no base* from which to formulate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; scientific questions or any other types of questions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Of course we still tend to feel uneasy: when it comes to survival,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; everyone is the Most Selfish Individual. We cannot help thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that Question B matters very much. The answer that I choose is:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; it does not matter.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A leap of faith?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I can accept as a continuation of my current
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; identity any conscious being who thinks that he is a continuation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of my current identity. I could not go to sleep if I could not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accept this.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A leap of faith for peace of mind? 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;  
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Brett:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Because I don't *know* enough about how my consciousness
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; and the experience of self-hood manifests to assume that it can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; persist completely decoupled from a matter substrate for any
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; length of time. My current thinking is no substrate means no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; conscious processing (or unconscious processing either). No
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; consciousness process means no self concept process. In short
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I assume that no brain means a discontinuation of me because it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; seems prudent to do so.
