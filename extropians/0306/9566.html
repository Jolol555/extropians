<p>Does SL4 have a FAQ or a glossary or something?  Where's the

<p><em>&gt; &gt; Certainly if you think &quot;God&quot; (according to this definition) exists in

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>That's my thinking as well.  (I was responding mostly to Rafal when I
<br>
raised this argument, who seemed to be arguing that there was a &quot;God&quot; in
<br>
some possible world, but not, you know, THIS one.)
<br>
<p>I think the only good response would have to be one in which the theist
<br>
gave her own sketch of a logically consistent world (surely we'd never get
<br>
it to be provably mathematically consistent) in which a being with maximal
<br>
greatness exists.  But, as we've seen, it's not easy to do this.  I
<br>
suppose the jury is still out as to whether it's ever been done, but I
<br>
think your sketch argument should, by itself, be adequate to show that no
<br>
one could ever produce a relevant counter-sketch.
<br>
<p>If someone did put together a plausible consistent counter-sketch, we'd
<br>
have to conclude that one of them wasn't *really* a possible world.
<br>
Theists certainly have some arguments in mind for this: I think they'd
<br>
consider a simple sketch of cellular automata vulnerable to cosmological
<br>
arguments:  &quot;how could a universe like that have come into existence?&quot;
<br>
they might ask.  (Where, presumably, they think they have a consistent
<br>
answer for their *own* sketch.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But this says nothing interesting in the argument against theism.  If
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there were an entity with command over the entire Process of Bayesia,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; existing at the root level of the enclosing reality with no comparable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; entities nearby (i.e., not a Corbinian Otaku), with interestingly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; posthuman yet basically nice motives, who intervened from time to time
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in our world to create miracles, atheism would be disproven.  Playing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with definitions to avoid the blow would be cheating.  This is what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; makes atheism falsifiable.
</em><br>
<p>Interestingly, some theists think that if that were really *all* there
<br>
was, then *they* would be disproven: something with basically nice motives
<br>
is obviously nowhere near the infinitely benevolent being they had in
<br>
mind, and if there isn't one of those, well, they consider themselves to
<br>
have lost the argument.
