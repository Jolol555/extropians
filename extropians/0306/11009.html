-----Original Message-----
<br>
From: <a href="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20[MEDIA]:%20USA%20vs%20UK">owner-extropians@extropy.org</a> [mailto:<a href="mailto:owner-extropians@extropy.org?Subject=RE:%20[MEDIA]:%20USA%20vs%20UK">owner-extropians@extropy.org</a>]
<br>
On Behalf Of Samantha Atkins
<br>
<p>The first notion that we Americans have an overblown respect for
<br>
authority 
<br>
really is a shocker though.  We'uns fairly well invented disrespect for 
<br>
governmental authorities and threw a successful revolution to underline
<br>
the 
<br>
point and supposedly formed governing documents precisely to limit and 
<br>
constrain such authority and keep it out of folks' hair as much as
<br>
possible.   
<br>
Now, it obviously wasn't a rousing success or we wouldn't be where we
<br>
are 
<br>
now.   I wonder if our schools simply neglected to teach such things to
<br>
a few 
<br>
generations?
<br>
<p>- samantha
<br>
<p>Im amazed at how many Americans do not realize we have
<br>
a written legal contract that limits the government's
<br>
authority and a court specifically set up to insure
<br>
that government stays within its bounds.
<br>
<p>Increasing taxation is a form of government outgrowing
<br>
its bounds.  For that reason, *all* tax increases must
<br>
be automatically opposed, utterly regardless of what 
<br>
use it is to be put.  Since we all must live within our
<br>
means, so must the government, especially the government
<br>
of a certain large, highly-populated western state which
<br>
shall remain nameless.
<br>
<p>Regarding Americans' disrespect for authority, I have
<br>
a theory on that.  Long before we get lessons on how
<br>
our nation was born out of rebellion against authority,
<br>
we get a more fundamental lesson in the form of 
<br>
instruction on how to cross a road with a bicycle.
<br>
We are instructed to dismount the bike and *walk*
<br>
it across the street or intersection.
<br>
<p>I ask you: is this not absurd?  Do motorcyclists
<br>
push their bikes across the intersection?  Not only
<br>
is it absurd, it is downright dangerous, for two
<br>
reasons.  First, if one walks the bike across the
<br>
street, one is in the road for more time than if
<br>
one rides across.  But secondly, and more importantly,
<br>
if one does obey that silly rule, one appears to be
<br>
a pussy.  Word will get soon around, resulting in three 
<br>
or four burly third-graders catching the hapless prole 
<br>
on the playground and beating him beyond recognition, 
<br>
early and often.
<br>
<p>Clearly, any authority which would suggest such a
<br>
thing is either stupid, malicious or both, not
<br>
deserving of respect or obedience.  Unless things
<br>
have changed a great deal since my childhood in the
<br>
60s, this bicycle thing is one of the very earliest 
<br>
and most important lessons learned by our children, 
<br>
resulting in their growing up to be solid self-reliant 
<br>
minarchists.
