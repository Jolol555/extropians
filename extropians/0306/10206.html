<em>&gt; &gt; I'm not interested in proving anything.  The strategy of &quot;buy a

</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pretty well.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The problem is recognizing a sweetheart.  If one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ten of these sweethearts go all Enron on you, then
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the 10% profit you made on the others average out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to nada.
</em><br>
<p>If a sweetheart starts to abuse you, put a stop to it (I mean literally, use
<br>
the &quot;stop&quot; function - predetermine how much you are willing to risk downside
<br>
ahead of time).  Remember, you are not married to the ball-and-chain.  You
<br>
didn't vow to love the stock through richer or poorer or through sickness as
<br>
long as ye both shall live.  Why would anyone sit around and wait for a
<br>
stock to go to $0.00?
<br>
<p>Last Friday (having bought a 300 shares of CREE the night before) I noticed
<br>
that CREE started to tank, so I quickly looked at the news - which was that
<br>
a brother of one of the founders was suing the company for billions of
<br>
dollars.  I had a stop in place for CREE, so I didn't lose much and didn't
<br>
have a boatload of shares to begin with).  CREE actually opened .70 higher
<br>
Friday morning than the night before.  But I didn't sit around watching CREE
<br>
continuing to tank over $6 to the downside before it bounced up over $2 by
<br>
the market close (ending up just under -$4 for the day).  Some traders even
<br>
see that &quot;dead cat bounce&quot; as a good play - when a stock hits the low of the
<br>
day and starts to gain ground again (it is not difficult to gauge the sell
<br>
orders turning into buy orders on Island and on Level II).  I didn't bother
<br>
any more with CREE - it was not a profitable trade for me, but a very small
<br>
loss.  Use those stops, people.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  Add this to the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that the day traders are not working a 9 to 5, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you find few winners.
</em><br>
<p>I agree there are few winners, compared to people who start the process, and
<br>
end up giving up (because they inevitably will suffer some losses while they
<br>
learn).  But something happens to traders who are able to learn from their
<br>
mistakes and persevere - they start to &quot;get it.&quot;  They &quot;get&quot; what they need
<br>
to do, what they need to watch out for (and what to watch *for*).  I am not
<br>
saying it's easy - I'm just saying it's possible to turn into a good trader.
<br>
Consistently.
<br>
<p>Again, remember that traders also make money when the market is down.  We've
<br>
hardly discussed shorting stocks (which helps liquidity in the stock
<br>
market), but that's another thing that most average investors don't do -
<br>
short stocks.  Average investors depend on the market to make gains.  But
<br>
traders who watch the market (or a particular stock or stocks) carefully,
<br>
have a good chance of profiting from any condition the market throws at
<br>
them.  Shorting stocks is not without its own pitfalls, but - again - stops
<br>
can be put into place to the upside.  Use those stops, people.
