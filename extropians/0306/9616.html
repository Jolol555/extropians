Multiple posts forwarded from the Down Syndrome list - TWC:
<br>
<p><p>Absolutely right. When ADHD is treated with the appropriate medication, the
<br>
difference in a child's achievement, and sense of self, can be tremendous. As a
<br>
special ed teacher, I've been blown away by what can happen when an accurate
<br>
diagnosis is combined with the right meds.

<p>I think you should spend a few days volunteering in a classroom to get a
<br>
better sense of what it is like - I've spent 14 years working in schools as both
<br>
a
<br>
teacher and an administrator - ADD/ADHD is real and it can be sheer torture
<br>
for a child when not identified and treated properly - independent/accelerated
<br>
learning is not going to &quot;fix&quot; those who truly have ADD/ADHD - contrary to
<br>
what you may believe not every child with ADD/ADHD is identified as &quot;special ed&quot;
<br>
and bringing in &quot;big bucks&quot; for schools (special education is expensive
<br>
schools aren't trying to identify more kids to get more money, in fact I'd be
<br>
more
<br>
fearful that children who should be identified and be receiving additional
<br>
services aren't because no one wants to spend the extra money) many kids
<br>
diagnosed
<br>
with ADD/ADHD and being treated prior to starting school are doing fine
<br>
without the assistance of &quot;special education&quot; - I am sorry you had such a poor
<br>
experience in school but it has been my experience that most school personnel
<br>
want
<br>
what is best for the student - if they voice a concern that a student may
<br>
need to be evaluated for ADD/ADHD by a physician they are doing so because they
<br>
believe it will help the student not because it will make their discipline
<br>
problems any easier.

My daughter attends regular classes at the high school, and is definitely

</em><br>
Well, I can't claim that Kathy is doing well in school, but the reason
<br>
the school pushed us to take her to a phychologist was the behavior
<br>
problems rather than the bad grades.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Personally, I have seen children go from failing to the honor roll once on
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
I'm still waiting for that, but she's at least not failing.
<br>
<p>Everyone in my family seems to have it to some degree (I think it comes
<br>
from my father), so I'm really hoping David (2.5, DS) doesn't have it as well.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p>I believe ADHD exists and can be treated with medication.
<br>
<p>I'll probably get flamed for this, BUT....
<br>
there are a few issues that makes it much more complicated!
<br>
<p>First, there is no real test for ADHD.  I truly wish that there were a test
<br>
to see if the dopamine levels were correct in a persons brain.  Instead they
<br>
do a survey of teachers and parents and sort of guess.  They guess at the
<br>
medication until they feel it is correct, and while it might not be cocaine,
<br>
it IS amphetamine.  Second, ADHD is misdiagnosed and it is typically
<br>
misdiagnosed in boys.  That is fact not theory.  Third, I belong to a list
<br>
for parents of gifted students.  Often they are misdiagnosed as ADHD because
<br>
they are bored and fidgeting in the classroom.  One parent compared it to
<br>
making an adult repeat Kindergarten and learn to count.  You would be
<br>
incredibly bored and fidgeting.
<br>
<p>Before anyone flames me for this please read my experience!
<br>
<p>I have been struggling with this lately with my 12 year old.  My 14 year old
<br>
has been in the gifted program since 2nd grade.  My 12 year old was referred
<br>
in 2nd grade by his teacher, but for some reason the school psych was
<br>
reluctant to test him.  (I suspect it was a budget issue and had little to
<br>
do with my son.)  Anyway, he was finally tested in the 6th grade.  To be
<br>
identified as gifted you must score 130 on either the verbal or the applied
<br>
parts of the test.  My son's verbal score was 128, his applied score was
<br>
106.  The 128 score is just under the limit.  Over the past 4 years I have
<br>
watched his apptitude test scores decline steadily.  He has been bored in
<br>
school for sooo long that he dislikes it and he has no study skills.  He
<br>
gets A's and B's but he doesn't have to work for them.
<br>
<p>Dr. Len you said that children that are performing well scholastically but
<br>
have behavior issues should not be medicated for ADHD.  Then why are they
<br>
suggesting this for my son?
<br>
<p>The school psych said my son had a variation between the applied parts of
<br>
the test and the verbal parts of the test that were in the school psych's
<br>
opinion &quot;statistically significant&quot;.  According to the school psych, anytime
<br>
the range between these scores is greater that 20 points they suspect ADHD.
<br>
NOTE: He said ADHD minus the hyperactivity or &quot;ADD&quot; in his own words.  My
<br>
school psych went on to tell me that although my son may have ADD that it
<br>
was a GOOD thing.  That very famous and intelligent people were ADD and were
<br>
brilliant because of it.  He told me that I needed to look at it differently
<br>
and that school teachers were notorious for looking at it as a bad thing
<br>
because they want kids to behave.  He said he didn't feel I should medicate
<br>
my son.
<br>
<p>Although NO teacher has every said ADD to me I felt that I wouldn't be a
<br>
good mother if I didn't follow up on this claim by the school psych.
<br>
<p>I spoke to my sister (a school teacher) about this.  She told me about a
<br>
wonderful psych that evaluated her daughter for ADHD.  She said that the
<br>
evaluation included an IQ test, history from parents and teachers, and a
<br>
variety of alternatives before resorting to medication.
<br>
<p>My insurance would not pay for this psychologist so I went to the psych that
<br>
my insurance would pay for.  This psychologist told me that IQ tests are NOT
<br>
used to determine ADHD (???) that he had never heard of such a thing.  BUT,
<br>
that if the teachers at school think my son fidgets a lot &quot;he should
<br>
probably be medicated.&quot;
<br>
<p>He gave me surveys to send to the teachers, and I have the surveys in my
<br>
kitchen right now waiting to be mailed to the teachers.  Whether or not my
<br>
son is medicated will be determined largely by their opinion of him.  I feel
<br>
a little like we are playing Russian Roulette with his future because I have
<br>
gotten conflicting information from the professionals who have seen him.
<br>
Finally, I'm not crazy about the idea of giving my child an amphetamine
<br>
without being certain of the diagnosis.
<br>
<p>Heather Schulte
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p>I appreciate your response.  I'm going to impose on you a little more
<br>
because I would love it if my perceptions are misconceptions.
<br>
<p>The follow-up professional I talked to works for the state mental health
<br>
center.  this agency is the only agency my insurance company will approve.
<br>
The used the criteria, and although I answered &quot;yes&quot; to most of the
<br>
inattentive questions (not the hyperactive ones) it is my personal feeling
<br>
than most children I know would get &quot;yes&quot; answers to these questions.
<br>
<p>According to WebMD Ritalin is methylphenidate and Adderall another commonly
<br>
used treatment for ADHD is Amphetamine mixed salts.  Dexedrine
<br>
(dextroamphetamine sulfate), and Cylert (pemoline), have been shown to help
<br>
about 70% of the people with ADHD.  All of these are stimulants and aren't
<br>
they addictive?
<br>
<p>Do you know one in NE Kansas or NW Missouri?  I'd love to get an opinion
<br>
from them.
<br>
<p>I have told you everything that I know.  The beggining of all of this was an
<br>
IQ test.  My son gets good grades.  He gets in trouble at school for minor
<br>
incidents 4-5 times each school year.  No teacher has told me that he has
<br>
ADD.   That is why it suprised me that the Mental Health Center was somewhat
<br>
eager jump to a diagnosis.
<br>
<p>Thanks for you opinions,
<br>
<p>Heather Schulte
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>I have always heard that adhd meds are &quot;uppers&quot; for non adhd and calming for
<br>
those suffering from adhd.  my sister has 1 child of 5 that she believes has
<br>
adhd.  she gives her adderall.  one day she mixed up her daughter's adderall
<br>
with her vitamin, and accidentally swallowed it.  She said she had a day of
<br>
&quot;euphoria&quot; that everything went better.  This caused me to pause and
<br>
think!!!  Either my sister (who has no obvious signs of adhd) is a sufferer,
<br>
OR the meds make everyone a little &quot;happier&quot;.  Why wouldn't a child who is
<br>
normally behavioral be good if he is in a state of euphoria from drugs?
<br>
Just an honest question!
<br>
<p>Heather Schulte
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>You said before that Ritalin (although it is in the same catagory as
<br>
Adderall) is not Amphetamine.  Is it less dangerous than Adderall in your
<br>
opinion?  What about the newer one ...Strattera?
<br>
<p>And what about the side effects?  Is increasing academic performance really
<br>
worth risking halucinations (the scariest side effect listed)?
<br>
<p>I'm not trying to slam anyone who gives thier child adhd drugs.  These are
<br>
just sincere questions from a worried mom hesitant to drug her son with a
<br>
strong stimulants for what she sees a mild case of inattentiveness.
<br>
<p>Heather Schulte
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>I heartily agree with Dr. Len.  I work with a woman in her forties who has
<br>
DS, and she has become infected with MRSA (Dr. Len could correct me on the
<br>
proper acronym and what the letters exactly mean, I've only heard them spoken).
<br>
This is basically, a really nasty antibiotic resistant staff infection.  We're
<br>
all being tested to see if we've been colonized.  She's had a ton of
<br>
antibiotics in her time;  probably 10 different courses at least since I've
<br>
known her.
<br>
She may soon lose an eye to it, and who knows?
<br>
<p>You can't be too careful with antibiotics these days.  Every time I have to
<br>
have my daughter on them I shudder, because I know what can happen...
<br>
<p>Sandra
<br>
Mom to  Ramona 19
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>Yes very good point about the antibiotics - I am wondering since most
<br>
children take their majority of anitbiotics because of ear infections do all
<br>
ear infections have to be treated with anitbiotics? Can an ear infection
<br>
ever just be let to &quot;run it's course&quot;. How does the doctor know whether or
<br>
not the infection is bacterial or viral?
<br>
Anna
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>Not a problem in the US to the degree that it is in countries like Mexico
<br>
where antibiotics are purchased over the counter.  Antibiotics being sold
<br>
w/o doctors advice is much more likely the cause of the &quot;superbugs&quot; than an
<br>
occasional misdiagnosis. IMO
<br>
Heather Schulte
<br>
<p>------------------------
<br>
<p>Heather, have they recommended starting meds with your son?   ADD doesn't
<br>
just run in the Duffey family, it practically gallops (remember the line from
<br>
Arsenic and Old Lace?..LOL).      My 17 yo was tested for it through his school
<br>
(his teachers DID feel he has it) and they did not dx him...they called it a
<br>
*unique learning style*.    Even though he wasn't dx'd with it, he is allowed
<br>
extra time on exams and tests at school and there are various *techniques* we
<br>
use to help him focus....like using timers, breaking studying up in increments,
<br>
and letting ALL his teachers know in the beginning of each year about what
<br>
works for Brendan (VERY hard because not all will cooperate and we've had
<br>
battles).   Brendan does so so in school (it IS an extremely academically
<br>
challenging
<br>
school though) but scores very high on all national tests (did great on his
<br>
first SAT's--takes the second ones next week and more his senior year) and
<br>
every teacher he's ever had has told us how incredibly smart he is.   We suspect
<br>
that there is a label in there somewhere, and maybe we'll do private testing
<br>
(still talking about it).   But my nephew Greg, Brendan's best friend, was dx'd
<br>
with it (his focus issues are much more blatant, AND the impulsivness too) and
<br>
has been on Adderall for 3 years.   He himself talks about what a difference
<br>
it makes (course, he forgets to take it a lot and his Mom, a Duffey, has major
<br>
ADD too...Man oh man).   When I think back to my elementary school days going
<br>
to a Catholic factory, er, I mean school,  with 65 to 70 kids in a classroom,
<br>
I can spout off handfuls of kids who probably had ADHD and instead were just
<br>
labelled *bad* kids.   And I suspect the prisons are riddled with people who
<br>
have it and never were dx'd.   So, it works both ways.
<br>
Donna
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p>After an hour of talking with me...not observing my son.... the psych told
<br>
me that we would have to wait for the questionaires to come back from the
<br>
teachers.
<br>
<p>However, he was almost certain that my son had ADD.  He proceded to tell me
<br>
what kind of meds he would give (Adderall because it is given less often).
<br>
I asked if there were alternative to medications we could try and he said we
<br>
could put a barrier up around his desk at school.
<br>
<p>I reminded him that the teachers were not indicating ADD and that his
<br>
behavior in school was not that uncharacteristic of a 12 yr. old boy.  He
<br>
said that based on my answers to the questions he asked me that &quot;it really
<br>
looked like ADD.&quot;
<br>
<p>Heather Schulte
<br>
<p>----------------------
<br>
<p>Yes Donna you are VERY right about this.  I just really felt that the psych
<br>
I saw did not take the time to get to know my son.  He talked to him for
<br>
maybe 5 minutes and was really pushing the issue of medicating when we left.
<br>
*sigh*
<br>
My problem is I need to find a doctor I trust to discuss this with but
<br>
that's going to cost an arm and a leg w/o my insurance companies approval.
<br>
Darn insurance companies.
<br>
<p>Heather Schulte
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p>Heather,
<br>
<p>Is there a Scottish Rite hospital near you?  If so, you can obtain learning
<br>
differences testing there (that includes ADD) at no charge.  They are
<br>
excellent (and thorough).
<br>
<p>Best regards,
<br>
Sharon
