Hi Brett, 
<br>
<p>Sorry I mangled Antonio Damasio's name.  Besides, one could
<br>
have reasonable read what I wrote as googlable, or being a
<br>
genuine reference.
<br>
<p>Here a description of what I was refering to:  Patients with
<br>
some kinds of brain damage behave exactly like normals on all
<br>
the usual tests.  But one kind of test showed what was going
<br>
on, and moreover, illustrated how our emotions are *needed*
<br>
(at present) in our thinking.  Here is an excerpt from my
<br>
book:
<br>
<p>RISK TAKING: THE GAMBLING EXPERIMENTS  Chapter in Damasio's
<br>
&quot;Descartes Error&quot; page 213-215.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another approach we took to testing the somalic-marker hypothesis
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;made use of a task designed by my postdoctoral student.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Frustrated, as all researchers are, by the artificial nature of lost
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;experimental neuropsychological tasks, he wanted to develop as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;lifelike a means as possible to assess decision-making performance.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The clever set of tasks that he devised, and further refined in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;collaboration with Hanna Damasio and Steven Anderson, have come to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;known in our laboratory, predictably enough, as the &quot;Gambling
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Experiments.&quot;  Overall, the setting for the experiments is colorful,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a far cry from the boring manipulations of most other such
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;situations.  Normals and patients alike enjoy it, and the nature of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the investigation makes for amusing episodes. I recall the bulging
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;eyes and dropped jaw of a distinguished visitor who came to my office
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;after walking by the lab where an experiment was in progress.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;There're people gambling in here!&quot; he informed me in a whisper.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the basic experiments the subject, known as the &quot;Player,&quot; sits in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;one of four decks or cards labeled A, B, C, and D.  The Player is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;given a loan of $5,000 (play money but looking like the real thing)
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and told that the goal of the game he is about to play is to lose as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;little as possible of the loan and try to make as much extra money as
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;possible.  Play consists of turning cards, one at a lime, from any of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the four leeks, until the experimenter says to stop. The Player thus
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;does not know the total number of turns required to end the game.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Player is told also that turning any and every card will result
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in earning a sum money, and that every now and then turning some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cards will result in both earning money and having to pay a sum of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;money to the experimenter.  Neither the amounts of gain or loss in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;any card, nor the cards' connection to a specific deck, nor the order
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of their appearance is disclosed at the outset.  The amount to be
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;earned or paid with a given card is disclosed only after the card is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;turned.  No other instruction is provided.   The tally of how much
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;has been earned or lost at any point is not disclosed, and the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;subject is not allowed to keep written notes.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The turning of any card in decks A and B pays a handsome $100, while
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the turning of any card in decks C and D only pays $50.  Cards keep
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;being turned on any deck, and quite unpredictably, certain cards in
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decks A and B (the $100-paying decks) require the Player to make a
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sudden nigh payment, sometimes as much as $1,250.  Likewise, certain
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;cards in decks C and D (the $50-paying decks) also require a payment,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;but the sums are much smaller, less than $100 on the average.  These
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;undisclosed rules are never changed.  Unbeknownst to the Player, the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;game will be terminated after 100 plays.  There e is no way for the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Player to predict, at the outset, what will happen , and no way to
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;keep in mind a precise tally of gains and losses as the game
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;proceeds.  Just as in life, where much of the knowledge by which we
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;live and by which we construct our adaptive future is doled out bit
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by bit, as experience accrues, uncertainty reigns.  Our
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;knowledge---and the Player's ---is shaped by both the world with
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;which we interact and by the biases inherent in our organism, for
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;example, our preferences for gain over loss, for reward over
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;punishment, for low risk over high risk.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What regular folds do in the experiment is interesting.  They begin
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by sampling from all four decks, in search of patterns and clues.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then, more often than not, perhaps lured by the experience of high
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;reward from turning cards in the A and B decks, they show an early
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;preference for those decks.  Gradually,k however, within the first
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thirty moves, they switch the preference to decks C and D.  In
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;general, they stick to this strategy until the end, although
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;self-professed high-risk players may resample decks A and B
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occasionally, only to return to the apparently more prudent course of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;action.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no way for players to carry out a precise calculation of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gains and losses.  Rather, bit by bit, they develop a hunch that some
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;decks---namely, A and B---are more &quot;dangerous&quot; than others.  One
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;might say they intuit that the lower penalties in decks C and D will
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;make them come out ahead in the long run, despite the smaller initial
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gain.  I suspect that before and beneath the conscious hunch there is
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a nonconscious process gradually formulating a prediction for the
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;outcome of each move, and gradually telling the mindful player, at
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;first softly but then ever louder, that punishment or reward is about
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to strike *if* a certain move is indeed carried out.  In short, I
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;doubt that it is a matter of only fully conscious process, or only
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fully nonconscious process.  It seems to take both types of
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;processing for the well-tempered decision-making brain to operate.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The behavior of ventromedial frontal patients in this experiment was
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;most informative.  What they did in the card game resembled what they
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;often have done in real life since they sustained their brain lesion,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and differed from what they would have done before the lesion.
<br>
<p>Perhaps this can now be found on-line somewhere too.  I'll look around,
<br>
because I consider this experiment absolutely fundamental.
<br>
<p>Lee
