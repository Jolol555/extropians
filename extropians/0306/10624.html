<p><em>&gt; Lets see, if I were a Moslem man in Indonesia or Malaysia or The
</em><br>
Philippines
<br>
<em>&gt; and was dirt poor, uneducated and commanded by a venal corrupt government
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how would I feel about the oppression of a tiny group of people 10,000
</em><br>
miles
<br>
<em>&gt; away that I have never see by another group of people that I have also
</em><br>
never
<br>
<em>&gt; seen? Well, my primary reaction would be of boredom, yet you claim this is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the reason they're in a suicidal murderous frenzy just as the Arabs are.
</em><br>
<p>I don't think the Muslims in those parts of the world *are* really bothered
<br>
about the Middle East, from what I know and people tell me. Some of them
<br>
don't like the US but that's for other reasons and they are more hostile to
<br>
other groups (Chinese mainly). It's basically Arab Muslims, Iranians and (a
<br>
lot but not all) Pakistanis who are wound up about this issue
<br>
(Israel/Palestine). I think that (a) that's because they *are* more directly
<br>
affected and (b) because that entire issue has become a kind of collective
<br>
displacement anxiety which they obsess about in order to avoid confronting
<br>
the real dilemma/problem they have. That is the difficulty they have in
<br>
coming to terms with modernity. The root of that problem IMHO is the
<br>
familial system of that part of the world, above all the very high level of
<br>
consanguineous marriages which causes all sorts of difficulties. Their
<br>
problem is they want many of the benefits of modernity but violently reject
<br>
its social aspects because of the way these threaten things such as
<br>
traditional family values that they hold very dear. The result is a feeling
<br>
of suppressed rage and anguish and an overpowering desire to find some way
<br>
of having your cake and eating it. Nothing unusual in that, its just that
<br>
for various reasons the problem is particularly acute in that part of the
<br>
world. SD
