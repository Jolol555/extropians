From: &quot;Robin Hanson&quot; &lt;<a href="mailto:rhanson@gmu.edu?Subject=Re:%20Why%20believe%20the%20truth?">rhanson@gmu.edu</a>&gt;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm not sure whether the short-term experience of living each way tells
</em><br>
you
<br>
<em>&gt; enough to decide which is the good life.
</em><br>
<p>Agreed. But I said &quot;a while&quot; not a &quot;short while&quot;. I think if such future
<br>
lives our like ours then a &quot;while&quot; would have to be long enough to
<br>
experience the life as having a certain &quot;narrative&quot;. When someone says &quot;I
<br>
tried it but that life was not for me&quot; we generally understand this to mean
<br>
that they had sufficient experience in that life. Someone who renounces a
<br>
&quot;life of sex, drugs and rock and roll&quot; after their first wild high school
<br>
party has just not given it the good old college try.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;But I grant that self-deception
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be what some, or even most people, really want in reflective
</em><br>
equilibrium.
<br>
<em>&gt; In my paper proposing betting markets as as the factual input to a form of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; government (<a href="http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf">http://hanson.gmu.edu/futarchy.pdf</a>), I suggest that people who
</em><br>
<em>&gt; do not want to face uncomfortable truths can probably successfully avoid
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paying much attention to such markets, just as people today who want to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believe in the virtue of politics manage to avoid seeing how the sausage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is made.  Bet in the markets the few minutes a day you are rational, and
</em><br>
then
<br>
<em>&gt; go back to your blissful ignorance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
Do you think choosing this life would be a moral failing? I think this is
<br>
where we entered into the debate. I thought you felt the same pull as me
<br>
that abandoning the truth is a moral failing of some sort. (And if so, what
<br>
is the basis for this claim?) This is not to say that if we think there is a
<br>
moral failing here that we would coerce people into not living the life of
<br>
blissful ignorance, this is only a question of how we are to judge them.
