<em>&gt; &gt; So, operationally from the outside and from the inside the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; uploaded copy is the original. I wonder then what the meaning
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; of &quot;but the uploaded copy is not REALLY the original&quot; can be.
</em><br>
<p>I'm thinking functional equality is *possibly* not the same as identity.
<br>
The contrary view appears to me to be that it *necessarily* is.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I feel like me because I remember the things that I remember
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (including what I don´t consciously remember at this moment)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or, in other words, because of the specific information coded
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in my brain. This is I believe the simplest explanation.
</em><br>
<p>I think this is just a restatement of the &quot;there is no possible difference&quot;
<br>
case. I'll grant the duplicated you would feel like they were you.
<br>
I won't grant that they *are* you just because they feel like they
<br>
are. I will grant that to me and everyone relating to you the duplicate
<br>
will be satisfactory.  I am more &quot;selfish&quot; when it comes to me. I don't
<br>
care whether you and my duplicate and everyone else in the world
<br>
agrees that after the transformation that produces my duplicate has
<br>
produce me, I *care* that *I* am not *sure* that it is so beforehand.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Yes; in every way your uploaded copy---or even you if you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are disintegrated at 10am tomorrow morning and then instantly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; re-integrated using the same or different atoms---will have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this same impression.  It could, even now, be happening a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hundred times a second.
</em><br>
<p>When you say &quot;could&quot; what are you basing your view on?
<br>
<p>That your atoms change through your life? Granted but not all
<br>
at once.
<br>
<p>That the clinically dead are sometimes revived? Granted,
<br>
but not after comprehensively being dismantled.
<br>
<p>Spores and nematode worms can be brought back to life
<br>
after being frozen simply by warming them up, but this doesn't
<br>
demonstrate consciousness returning. It suggests it might. If there
<br>
is no important difference between consciousness and whatever
<br>
passes through the neurons of the worm AND if it doesn't matter
<br>
that the atoms are *all* exchanged at once then you are correct.
<br>
In both the above cases of frozen organisms reanimating the atoms
<br>
were only exchanged to a negligible degree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I think when one dies consciousness goes on, even if that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; particular individual stream of consciousness stops.
</em><br>
<p>This actually seems to come closer to a belief in a soul or astral
<br>
travel to me than the alternate view. Your positing that the
<br>
substrate (or lack of it for a time) doesn't matter. I think
<br>
consciousness is like a running, a self referencing program or set
<br>
of interrelated programs, it requires a substrate on which to run.
<br>
Can it survive a full substrate change all at once? (Not having a
<br>
substrate for a time). That I contend *we* do not know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; There are still thinkers thinking thoughts. Of course you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; can accept this as a partial &quot;answer&quot; only i[f] you believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; that each consciousness is fundamentally the same, in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other words that there is no physical or spiritual &quot;signature&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other than information that defines the difference between
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; you and I.
</em><br>
<p>My thesis contains no &quot;spiritual signature&quot; it contains recursive
<br>
biological programs that require somewhere to store not just
<br>
thoughts but thoughts about thoughts, and thoughts about
<br>
thoughts about thoughts etc. Possible this requires some sort
<br>
of recursion counter and a developmental process. Ie. You
<br>
can't have 'thoughts-about-thoughts' until the wetware has
<br>
developed enough to have 'thoughts' and 'feelings' first and
<br>
so on. I think children have thoughts and feelings before they
<br>
have a sense of self, before they become what we take
<br>
to be fully sentient.
<br>
<p>Now the question is once an adult level of sentience is achieved
<br>
can you capture the recursion counters in the wetware? A
<br>
snapshot of the conscious process and memories and restore
<br>
it either onto an identical wetware substrate or a different set
<br>
of firmware on an upload. I don't know.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; So when I die &quot;I&quot; will continue as another thinker thinking
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; other thoughts and remembering other things: this &quot;I&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; (weak I) is already preserved. If what I am interested in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; is preserving a &quot;strong I&quot; (the thinker who is thinking these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; specific thoughts and remembering these specific things),
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; then I do not see anything wrong with uploading when it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; technically feasible.
</em><br>
<p>I see nothing *morally* wrong with uploading. Even if it doesn't
<br>
work, if all my friends and family do it, and it works well enough,
<br>
then old solipsist that I am, I'm better off than if they were gone
<br>
completely. Its a victimless crime if their original &quot;strong I&quot; was
<br>
going to die anyway.
<br>
<p>And Lee is right, I suspect, in holding that the memesets that
<br>
*think* they will survive uploading will stand a better chance
<br>
then those that doubt if such translates into decisions to act
<br>
or not.
