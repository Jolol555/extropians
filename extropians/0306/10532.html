vendetta to fight here.  I am often contacted off-list by people who have given 
<br>
up trying to have discussions on the extropians list.  Sometimes they just 
<br>
become lurkers only, sometimes they drop off altogether.  They just get tired of 
<br>
the constant battles to defend themselves online.  
<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having read that why should I not agree with you that you do often 
<br>
seem to be fighting a personal vendetta?  In fact I will agree with most of what 
<br>
you say above.  But if you look around you will find many of the people you 
<br>
are vendetting against feel the same way.  There seems to be a politically 
<br>
correct line to hoe here and heaven help anyone that disagrees.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To give you an example of your seperation from the thinking of many.  
<br>
You are apparently afraid to declare yourself a communist (no, that is not a 
<br>
charge, I could care less one way or the other).  It would not scare me in the 
<br>
least.  I don't think it would scare many of my friends.  Back in the 70s we 
<br>
picked up the banner of the Libertarian Party at a time when people not only 
<br>
rediculed us and our ideas but in fact equated us with the Communist Party.  
<br>
Yes, that did literally happen on the streets here in Chicago.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did we do?  Nothing.  We were on the street to get signatures for 
<br>
our ballot petitions so we used the opportunity to collect more signatures.  
<br>
That is one of the reasons I am not afraid -- I have been there, done that, 
<br>
and know that in the vast majority Americans don't react either violently or 
<br>
vociferiously.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my other reason is that I don't like to see any person walking 
<br>
around so afraid they react with a &quot;bellylaugh&quot; when told there is no reason to 
<br>
fear.  That is not the America I live in.
<br>
Ron h.
