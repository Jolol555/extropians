<br>
<p>Snippets from a moderately toned, Washington Times article.
<br>
<p>&lt;&quot;What we think of ourselves does not depend on the opinions of others,&quot; says 
<br>
Matthew Spalding, director of the B. Kenneth Simon Center for American 
<br>
Studies at the Heritage Foundation. &quot;And that is what it means to be self-governing, 
<br>
as our founders originally intended. It gives us great confidence.&quot; 
<br>
    &quot;We don't ignore world opinion, but we don't allow it to determine our 
<br>
fate. At our core, we have intellectual and moral independence in the very 
<br>
largest sense.&quot; 
<br>
    Poll numbers support that, too. 
<br>
    Almost six out of 10 Americans, according to a recent ABC News poll, are 
<br>
not particularly concerned that the relationships with France, Germany and 
<br>
Russia were bruised during the war against Iraq. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>*You can't please everyone, especially when some of those &quot;everyones&quot; want 
<br>
the US as a pacified, dumb, puppet.*
<br>
<p>and...
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;Indeed, a Carnegie poll in November of more than 1,000 foreign-born 
<br>
immigrants found that 80 percent of them, given the chance to &quot;do it again,&quot; would 
<br>
come to the United States; 96 percent said they were happy; and 80 percent 
<br>
called this nation &quot;a unique country that stands for something special in the 
<br>
world.&quot; &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>*Comming to a different language and social structure is rugged. On the other 
<br>
hand, the US is still one of the few 'immigration' countries left.*
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
and,...
<br>
&lt;&lt;This week, it was the British Broadcasting Corp.'s turn to poke at America. 
<br>
A BBC poll of 11,000 persons in 11 countries released Tuesday said 65 percent 
<br>
of those surveyed thought Americans were &quot;arrogant,&quot; and 85 percent said 
<br>
Americans were not &quot;humble.&quot; &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>*Humble? Why we are the humblest people on Earth! :-D   Arrogant, maybe. I 
<br>
don't sit around work all day thinking how great America is. I worry about us 
<br>
becomming less free, and in turn we become less free because we are less 
<br>
resolute. The American political establishment's love-affair with the Saudi-ruling 
<br>
class troubles me, the lack of understanding that when high-tech jobs go 
<br>
overseas to foreign outsourced companies (as has been argued before), nobody locally 
<br>
will benefit in the US., except the Boards of Directors. Long-term we wind up 
<br>
with a poorer country. The need for a decent energy policy worries me, and so 
<br>
forth. So, I for one, do not sit back confidently, with my feet up and gloat 
<br>
over America and the rest of the world.  I see much of the world, resentful and 
<br>
envious of the US. Whether that envy is rationally merited is another issue, 
<br>
but thats what I see, or focus on.
