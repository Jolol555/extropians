</em><br>
<p>At one time I did but I'm afraid that was quite a few years ago. Several
<br>
academic journals are devoted to the study of financial markets. Those
<br>
journals are filled with statistical evidence for the efficient market
<br>
hypothesis (EMH). I also did my own statistical research, mainly in a failed
<br>
attempt to disprove EMH. 
<br>
<p>I was the options coordinator for my office of Merrill Lynch, meaning that I
<br>
was responsible for overseeing all trading in stock and index options in the
<br>
office, and for training and advising new brokers about the subject. I once
<br>
wrote a program that ran literally for four entire days analyzing the
<br>
complete history of the S+P 100 index (also known as the OEX).  My program
<br>
discovered what appeared to be a small anomaly to EMH using a complex
<br>
formulation of the OEX put/call ratio as an indicator. I made some money
<br>
with it but unfortunately the anomaly vanished about six months later,
<br>
assuming it really existed in the first place.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Like for instance technical analysis patterns etc. (
</em><br>
<em>&gt; i'm quite sure that most well known patterns are of no use whatsoever)
</em><br>
<p>Right. They are of no use.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have a very hard time getting hold of historic stock data
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that are precise enough to do research on. 
</em><br>
<p>I once had the daily history of the Dow Jones Industrials dating back almost
<br>
a century in an Excel spreadsheet. I'm sorry I no longer have it and I don't
<br>
remember how I obtained it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; My plan for the next couple of years is somewhat identical to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the work you seem to have done previously  - to shoot down as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many trading strategies as possible, and perhaps, if i'm
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lucky, find a few that seem to work.
</em><br>
<p>Good luck. I hate to say it but I think your chances of finding one that
<br>
works is virtually zero. You might find something that appears to work for
<br>
awhile, but don't fall into the trap of believing you've discovered a truly
<br>
valid trading system. I am firmly convinced that no trading system can pass
<br>
a properly designed statistical test. 
<br>
<p>It's a shame that most people in the investment business don't understand
<br>
statistics. If they did understand statistics then they would quit and get
<br>
into a different business, like I did. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; Until i have more results, i'll keep investing like i have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; started out. Being long seemingly undervalued stocks, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; being short anything real-estate related that is also priced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; high on book value, earnings and has a bad debt/equity ratio.
</em><br>
<p>My advice now, to myself and to my friends and family, is to stay long.
<br>
Never go short and never sell unless you really need the money. Own a
<br>
reasonably but not overly diversified portfolio. In the long run the market
<br>
rewards investors according to the level of risk they take (on the long
<br>
side).
<br>
<p>Despite occasional coughs and hiccups, the world economy is growing and
<br>
there is every reason to believe it will continue to grow. The market grows
<br>
with the world economy. This is all anyone needs to know about the market.
