<p>Yes I know that argument. I spent more than a decade as a licensed general
<br>
securities broker, and like you I also have an education in business,
<br>
including business law. I know all the regulations and the theories behind
<br>
them. I was bound by those regulations for many years. Fortunately I am no
<br>
longer in the investment business, so I can speak freely. :)
<br>
<p>Just to be clear, we are not talking about fraudulent public disclosures by
<br>
the company, which are and should be a crime. 
<br>
<p>We are talking about private investors profiting from new information about
<br>
a company obtained before that new information is widely publicized. For
<br>
example you might obtain knowledge that the next earnings report from XYZ
<br>
Corp is going to be higher than expected. Should you profit from that
<br>
knowledge by buying stock in XYZ? The law says no. It is legal to act on a
<br>
*guess* but not on a *fact*. The only exception is when everyone already has
<br>
access to that fact, in which case there is no excess profit to be gained
<br>
from your knowledge of the fact as it is already discounted in the stock
<br>
price. 
<br>
<p>I believe the market should be seen as a competition between investors to
<br>
acquire and act on the most profitable information, such that &quot;cheating the
<br>
buyer&quot; has the same meaning as &quot;out-competing the buyer.&quot; After all, you are
<br>
attempting to &quot;cheat the buyer&quot; any time you sell a stock because you think
<br>
it's going to drop in price. You are hoping someone less savvy than you will
<br>
buy it from you and take a bath in it instead of you. This element of
<br>
&quot;criminal intent&quot; is present regardless of how you arrived at your negative
<br>
forecast of the stock price. 
<br>
<p>In theory the market should be a game in which superior knowledge about
<br>
companies buys the investor a superior return over the market averages. It
<br>
should be a game in which the investor who knows the most, makes the most.
<br>
This is after all the way most US investors *think* the market works.
<br>
Investors and their brokers and analysts all operate on the (false) 
<br>
assumption that good knowledge gained from public sources will buy one an
<br>
excess return in the market. This belief is what drives the market. But it
<br>
is not the way the US markets work *in reality*. The US markets are so
<br>
efficient and regulated that knowledge buys one absolutely nothing unless it
<br>
is so-called &quot;inside&quot; knowledge, in which case Uncle Sam says it's a crime.
<br>
And that problem is exactly what I'm railing against. It is in effect a
<br>
crime in the US to have more knowledge about a company than the investor on
<br>
the other end of the transaction. You can *pretend* to yourself that you
<br>
have access to more and better knowledge than the other guy, and this is
<br>
exactly what Wall Street *wants* you to think, but if you actually *do* have
<br>
access to such superior knowledge then you're looking at a prison sentence.
<br>
<p>As I mentioned, this is not the case in every country. Taiwan has a vibrant
<br>
stockmarket but they have no insider trading laws (last time I checked
<br>
anyway, which was admittedly quite some years ago). In Taiwan, the game
<br>
works the way it should work: investors who know the most, make the most. In
<br>
Taiwan it pays to do your homework. Smart, knowledgeable investors make more
<br>
money than dumb, ignorant investors. That is the way it ought to be.
<br>
<p>But studies show that in the US, knowledge obtained through conventional
<br>
public means buys one absolutely nothing. One might just as well throw darts
<br>
at the newspaper to pick stocks. This is a primary reason that I got out of
<br>
the business ten years ago: after spending more than 12 years in the game,
<br>
and after doing some in-depth statistical research, I realized to my great
<br>
disappointment that *public knowledge is worthless*. So-called inside
<br>
information has value, but the rules make its use a crime. 
<br>
<p>The business section of the newspaper is an interesting story about the
<br>
drama of American business but otherwise it's just a waste of trees.
