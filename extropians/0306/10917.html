<p>I have been saying this for a couple of years now.  The whole upload/copy
<br>
question is a matter of semantics.  People don't disagree on the facts of
<br>
the operation.  They disagree on terms and labels.  Do we call the two
<br>
results the &quot;same&quot; or &quot;different&quot;?  In many ways they are the same.  In many
<br>
ways they are different.  It depends on the definition of same and
<br>
different.  People can't seem to understand this.  They believe that only
<br>
their definitions are right and that only their conclusions are right.  What
<br>
they don't see is that both sides are correct.  Having a dictionary with
<br>
multiple meanings for each word, we find that the results are different(1)
<br>
from each other, while they are not different(2) from each other.  There is
<br>
no contradiction or compromise is this conclusion.  People end up arguing
<br>
for their definitions and labels.  They do not end up talking about
<br>
objective reality or even theoretical reality.  As you say, they are talking
<br>
past each other.
