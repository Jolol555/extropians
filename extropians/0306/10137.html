<p>&nbsp;... And just to reel this all back in, the only duty a muslim has to a
<br>
non-muslim
<br>
is to inform him that there is one god, named allah and mohammed was his
<br>
<p>messenger.  After that, any failure to convert (ergo recognize the one
<br>
true god)
<br>
is a failure on your part, and you are judged accordingly.  Anyone who
<br>
has not
<br>
heard the call of Islam, is not responsible for his lack of recognition
<br>
for the message,
<br>
and is judged based on his actions, and not any of the specific
<br>
performances required
<br>
that form the five pillars of Islam (e.g. how kind they've been). ...
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I see.  
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Paul, you seem to be up to speed on Islam, so perhaps you
<br>
can enlighten me on a question that has puzzled me for nearly two
<br>
years.  Given the above, please explain the line of reasoning that 
<br>
led a group of devout Muslim believers to conclude that the people who
<br>
worked in the world trade center were guilty of some heinous act that
<br>
made
<br>
them deserving of a horrifying death.  Were there not those among
<br>
the New Yorkers who had never heard of Islam or the prophet?  Were there
<br>
not those among them who couldn't find Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran,
<br>
Palestine or
<br>
Israel on a map?  What basic doctrine of the Muslim faith can be quoted 
<br>
that leads to the conclusion that these people were somehow responsible 
<br>
for Israel's actions toward the Palestinians, or for the Islamic world's
<br>
general
<br>
failings, and therefore should be murdered?  The Washington Pentagon 
<br>
attack might make some vague brutal sense in the allies-of-Israel
<br>
business, 
<br>
but how are those who worked in the WTC in New York to be blamed?  
<br>
Surrah and verse numbers please. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
There's your religion of &quot;violence, religious suppression and
<br>
terrorism&quot;. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
So you say.  By what line of reasoning do they conclude that they have
<br>
the right to judge me for failing to worship their imaginary friend?
<br>
How have
<br>
they the right to judge *anyone* for failing to recognize their
<br>
imaginary
<br>
friend?  Such a religion is inherently dangerous.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
My advice, leave them alone, they're on a *completely* different trip
<br>
than
<br>
westerners. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
I see.  What *completely * different trip were they on when they decided
<br>
to 
<br>
take a plane trip to New York?  How do you suggest we prevent such 
<br>
*completely* different trips in the future? 
<br>
