<a href="mailto:matus@matus1976.com?Subject=Re:%20[Iraq]%20The%20real%20reason%20for%20the%20war">matus@matus1976.com</a> writes: I am willing to bet we will not see any retraction of that 
<br>
particular declaration of war, since Norway, still being a country that is not 
<br>
Islam, is eventually to be targeted.
<br>
<p>Michael,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, the Sudanese Moslems just burned a family of Christian 
<br>
Missionaries in their home.  To proselytize among Moslems is a a mortal offense.  
<br>
Was it Nigeria where we just had a bloody riot because someone had the 
<br>
audacity to hold an international beauty pageant. The Saudis are financing radical 
<br>
mosques over the globe.  If I read my middle eastern discussion list I find such 
<br>
scintillating subjects being debated as 'If I have intercourse with a slave 
<br>
is that sinful?&quot;  Also whether or not the wearing of revealing Levi's were 
<br>
sinful.  Ditto, the amount of sin involved in shaking hands with a western woman 
<br>
when introduced to her in a business setting.  Frankly I am repeating earlier 
<br>
comments that I have made.  Lately I have not had the heart to read the tiny 
<br>
minds involved in those questions.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But best of all is the media from the middle east.  MEZ' middle 
<br>
eastern countries are sitting on a powder keg.  The wealthy ones have the poor ones 
<br>
so subjugated that if they relax the pressure for a moment they are goners.  
<br>
They are using the US as Hitler used the Jews.  Consequently their stories are 
<br>
nothing but a long list of events spun to make the US appear villainous.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All in all there is obviously a large segment of the middle eastern 
<br>
people that regard us only as fit for subjugation.  To them we are a people 
<br>
without a God or any standards whatever.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, MEZ comes along and offers to lead me down every rabbit path in 
<br>
the briar patch to prove that the US is sinless.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course we are not sinless.  But I don't have to prove that we am 
<br>
sinless to have the right to defend ourselves against the 911 terrorists and 
<br>
their oh so cynical supporters.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If MEZ wishes to be a force for good.  I suggest he start explaining 
<br>
their errors to his middle eastern friends.  Tell them that our civilization is 
<br>
equal to theirs, our culture is equal to theirs and our choice to worship our 
<br>
God or to not worship is as valid as their decision to worship Allah.  In any 
<br>
case if there is an Allah he will hold us to account not them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, Michael, you are right.  &quot;Norway, still being a 
<br>
country that is not Islam, is eventually to be targeted.&quot;  Michael, the shame and 
<br>
the futility of it is those poor dummies don't realize that we smart enough to 
<br>
listen to them and draw the obvious conclusions.
<br>
Ron h.
