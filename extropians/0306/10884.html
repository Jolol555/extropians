<p>The research is published in the British Medical Journal

<p>Pill could reduce cardiovascular disease considerably.
<br>
<p>Taking a single combination pill daily could reduce the incidence of
<br>
cardiovascular disease by over 80%. In the first of three articles in
<br>
this issue, Wald and colleagues (p 1419) present the concept of
<br>
combining six active components in one pill (the Polypill) taken every
<br>
day from age 55, or sooner if people have a diagnosis of cardiovascular
<br>
disease or diabetes. They argue that the combination of a statin, a
<br>
thiazide, a blocker, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor, folic
<br>
acid, and aspirin simultaneously reduces four key cardiovascular risk
<br>
factors: low density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, serum
<br>
homocysteine, and platelet function. The authors' systematic review and
<br>
meta-analysis of over 200 studies (p 1423) shows that the use of statins
<br>
can lower low density lipoprotein cholesterol by 1.8 mmol/l, which could
<br>
decrease the risk of ischaemic heart disease by 60% and stroke by 17%.
<br>
Their examination of 354 randomised controlled trials (p 1427) found
<br>
that giving drugs at half the standard dose can significantly lower
<br>
blood pressure with minimal adverse effects, which in turn reduces the
<br>
risk of stroke by 63% and ischaemic heart disease by 46%. In an
<br>
accompanying editorial, Rodgers (p 1407) says that the Polypill may have
<br>
enormous potential for preventing cardiovascular disease, including in
<br>
developing countries.
<br>
<p>Follow the links for more details.

<p>Also BBC news item

<br>
<p>They are now planning trials of a polypill, so that probably means
<br>
several years before it is readily available.
<br>
<p>But if you are at risk, then low-dosage aspirin and folic acid is
<br>
available over the counter and would certainly give you some of the
<br>
benefits.
