<p>I believe he said he had too little to invest.  In his
<br>
defense, there is a demonstrated minimum amount of
<br>
financial resources, which most people are presently
<br>
unfortunately below, where one can achieve meaningful
<br>
progress in various technologies with just that
<br>
amount.
<br>
<p>In theory, if one could produce sudden and rapid
<br>
prosperity for many people, such that various costs of
<br>
living do not get a chance to slowly rise to consume
<br>
most of this prosperity before it is around long
<br>
enough for the people are secure in its existance,
<br>
then one could generate a large investor class from
<br>
the significant percentage of these people who would
<br>
see nothing better to do with their newfound wealth
<br>
than to make more of it, achieving some non-financial
<br>
gains along the way.  (Put shortly: give a lot of
<br>
people $1 billion each, and you could talk a lot of
<br>
'em into investing in technologically progressive
<br>
companies, or even charities.)
<br>
<p>In theory, this is what most US presidential elections
<br>
boil down to for most voters (concerned more about
<br>
their own economy than about anything else), though
<br>
there has yet to be a candidate who has successfully
<br>
tapped into the &quot;Make Money Fast: Vote For Me&quot; meme
<br>
(at least without paying voters directly, which is
<br>
widely perceived as an unsustainable wealth generation
<br>
mechanism among other negative qualities, and was thus
<br>
made illegal).  I wonder if it would be possible, once
<br>
space access has been made much cheaper by certain
<br>
processes already underway, to propose federal backing
<br>
for space mining initiatives to achieve this effect.
<br>
Say, charge NASA, under credible threat of dissolution
<br>
if they do not perform fast (if they have not already
<br>
been reformed), with nudging some M-type asteroids
<br>
into Earth orbit within one or two years.  Meanwhile,
<br>
make sure American companies can extract anything of
<br>
value Earth-side (platinum-group metals, say) for
<br>
cheap before any effective international competition
<br>
can come around (say, put some guards up there, then
<br>
let the international legal challenges play out for
<br>
the year or two that mining takes).  Let the market
<br>
start bottoming out for said valuables - it doesn't
<br>
matter, the voters have their bucks and you've got
<br>
re-election.  Want an encore so your veep can sit in
<br>
your chair?  The not-so-valuable metals left behind
<br>
can be converted into a vast horde of solar power
<br>
satellites: a jobs program funded by the above wealth.
<br>
Or maybe a crash program into practical helium-3
<br>
fusion, if that seems viable, and set up American
<br>
helium-3 mining companies.  And that's just space
<br>
access; severely reducing food and synthetic gasoline
<br>
costs via biotech is another path, albeit perhaps not
<br>
quite as easy to do fast enough.
