</em><br>
<p>I served in the US Navy, where I operated and maintained 
<br>
gun fire control systems (everything that told the guns 
<br>
where to point and when to go bang). This just means I 
<br>
have direct experience with the subject, and that I have a 
<br>
little bias in favor of my former work. In short, maximum 
<br>
accurate range makes a big difference. Indeed, accuracy 
<br>
makes up for explosive load. That's why battleship's 
<br>
needed sixteen-inch guns. The large shells went far with a 
<br>
big load. That big load compensated for their poor 
<br>
accuracy by modern standards.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;A while back I read a bit about WWII-era battleship 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fights.  One
</em><br>
<em>&gt;aspect that stuck in my mind was the difficulty of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;hitting your
</em><br>
<em>&gt;opponent at all.  
</em><br>
<p>That was technology, at best, of the 1930s. Ships in the 
<br>
American Navy aren't much more than twenty years old 
<br>
today, if that.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;I'm not sure how stable a gun platform 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a steaming
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ship in heavy sea is.
</em><br>
<p>It's not a very stable platform. I remember rolls of 
<br>
fifteen degrees. Ships make very stable _gun_ platforms, 
<br>
because the directors (turrets, missle racks, etc.) take 
<br>
correction from the ship's gyroscope. Directors that don't 
<br>
take that correction (e.g., RAM launchers, VLS cells, and 
<br>
Harpoon tubes) don't need it. Generally they fire weapons 
<br>
that home, or have guidance independent of the ship's 
<br>
position.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;  The target keeps moving around, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;too.  And
</em><br>
<p>That's why you have radar. The radar antennas also have 
<br>
gyroscopic stabilization where its needed. Surface-to-air 
<br>
radars need much less stabilization. Remember the ships of 
<br>
a fleet can compare radar fixes on a targets from multiple 
<br>
sources too. Accurately knowing the target's location 
<br>
isn't nearly as hard as you might think. The limit on 
<br>
accuracy I remember came from the limitations of the radar 
<br>
set's angular resolution. Over the ranges of the ship's 
<br>
guns, this wasn't a real problem. Modern radar sets have 
<br>
even less trouble.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;while the ballistics of your guns are known (from 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;empirical testing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;I suspect, rather than first principles)
</em><br>
<p>Mostly the latter, actually.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;environmental conditions
</em><br>
<em>&gt;are variable with wind, rain, etc.  When you are shooting 
</em><br>
<p>Wind is well known at launch--it's continuously measured. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;at a
</em><br>
<em>&gt;distance of several km's, these things add up.  I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;understand ship
</em><br>
<em>&gt;artillery started shooting with a guesstimate, observed 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;how far
</em><br>
<em>&gt;they were off, and tried to compensate.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
They still do, when shooting at a surface target on the 
<br>
ocean. We tracked fall-of-shot by the radar return of the 
<br>
splash when a shell missed. Then we corrected as needed. 
<br>
Not too hard to do, even with user interfaces that dated 
<br>
from the 1970s. Ships don't have short turning radiuses, 
<br>
nor do warships go all that fast, and they accelerate and 
<br>
decelerate poorly by the standards of land vehicles. You 
<br>
can predict a ship's course with good confidence, and that 
<br>
confidence varies directly with the size of the ship.
<br>
<p>Remember my eariler post's comment about &quot;digging holes&quot;? 
<br>
I wasn't kidding. That's just with GPS improving the 
<br>
knowledge of ship's own position. Of course, shooting at a 
<br>
geographic position reduces uncertainty a whole lot. You 
<br>
don't perfectly know where you are, but you know the 
<br>
target's position very well indeed.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;With this in mind, shooting dumb rounds beyond the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;horizon looks
</em><br>
<em>&gt;entirely pointless to me.  
</em><br>
<p>Good reasoning, but not true.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;Certainly for anti-ship use. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You are
</em><br>
<em>&gt;not going to hit anything.  
</em><br>
<p>Wanna bet? In live fire exercises, we used to shoot at 
<br>
sleds towed behind speedboats. We were forbidden to fire 
<br>
unless we had an offset set into the firing solution. You 
<br>
don't want to hit the sled, just demonstrate accuracy 
<br>
enough that you would've hit the sled save for that 
<br>
offset--
<br>
generally not a problem. A target's speed mattered more 
<br>
than environmental conditions, and then only because the 
<br>
radar tended to lock onto the rooster-tail of the craft 
<br>
rather than the boat itself.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;For engaging targets at long 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;range you
</em><br>
<p>Long range to Naval Gun Fire means more than 30,000 yards, 
<br>
or out of gun range.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;really want something with homing ability, either 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;missiles or, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;fired from a gun, at least smart projectiles that have 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;terminal
</em><br>
<em>&gt;guidance.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Oh no argument there. Harpoon anti-ship missiles hit 
<br>
_much_ harder than gun shells. They carry more explosive, 
<br>
penetrate farther into a ship, and also have a secondary 
<br>
explosion after the warhead detonates. All that fuel 
<br>
usually explodes too, y'know. They can also be programmed 
<br>
for things like hitting from above (flying down the 
<br>
target's exhaust stack) or hitting right at the waterline. 
<br>
Shells don't do that. On the other hand, a ship carries 
<br>
hundreds of shells loaded with HE, a few dozen 
<br>
illumination rounds, and a small number of shells loaded 
<br>
with white phosphorous. Shells cost little. Harpoons cost 
<br>
plenty.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;speed at your opponents, you are going to hit them 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;instead of just
</em><br>
<em>&gt;harassing the fish.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>Sonar harasses fish. Naval gun fire feeds them.
