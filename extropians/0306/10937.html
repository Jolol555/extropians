</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, hasty judgement! ...have you ever _had_ PTSD?    :  )
</em><br>
<p>You know, you are right.  That is a hasty judgment.   However, I have been 
<br>
subject to doctors being all too happy to hand out a pill to make any 
<br>
difficulty go away rather than teaching real-life tools for handling at least 
<br>
some of those problems.  I worry that we may reach too often for a seeming 
<br>
technological fix that makes the symptoms go away without really 
<br>
understanding or dealing with the actual issues and other causes.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;  Not that I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;saying guilt is a good thing but rather that getting done with it is an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;important part of growth and self-responsibility.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It's not removing guilt, it's removing _the ability to feel guilt_. In
</em><br>
<em>&gt; my opinion 'guilt' is a symptom of mental disorder due to malfunction.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There is no reason for an intelligent, neurologically healthy person to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever feel it. If they have done nothing deliberately that they know to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; be bad, what is there to feel guilty about? Mistakes should not invoke
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guilt; mistakes happen to everybody and we all know that and accept it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; And if someone is being an a-hole on purpose, they're unlikely to feel
</em><br>
<em>&gt; guilty, because they're an a-hole...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Where does that leave a place for guilt, apart from filling you full of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hormones that make you sick and shortening your lifespan?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Also, let's not mislead people... TMS is not surgery...d'you think we
</em><br>
<em>&gt; should change the subject title?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>While I don't consider longterm guilt at all optimal I think some sense of 
<br>
remorse over misdeeds is not necessarily a bad thing.   Clinging to that 
<br>
indefinitely isn't healthy.   
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;It has nothing to do with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;religion to disapprove of such misuse of technology.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Yes I agree. However, wiping 'guilt' is not, for me, a misuse of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; technology but part of the cure for a malfunction, so perhaps it is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hasty to use the word 'misuse'? ... a lot of people think stem-cell
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cloning is 'misuse'...you know what I mean?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It is certainly subject to misuse though. 
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; [re: guilt]
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No, it doesn't.  Not if it is dealt with intelligently.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ...That's why I asked about the PTSD...ever-increasing guilt about your
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inability to cope, and your inability to stop experiencing horrid things
</em><br>
<em>&gt; against your will, can utterly destroy your life.
</em><br>
<p>But this is a bit more than your run-of-the-mill guilt over some actual 
<br>
wrongdoing.
