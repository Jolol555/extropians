&nbsp;&nbsp;Trespassers uproot John Innes pea plants. 
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.nature.com/nsu/030616/030616-13.html">http://www.nature.com/nsu/030616/030616-13.html</a>
<br>
<p>&quot;The pea plants contained an extra gene, designed to 
<br>
highlight parts affected by drought. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
Intruders have destroyed genetically modified research
<br>
plants growing at the John Innes Centre in Norwich, UK.
<br>
<p>The plants were part of a three-year contained experiment
<br>
looking at the effects of drought on plant growth. They
<br>
were not part of a trial of commercial crops.
<br>
<p>&quot;This attack was intended solely to suppress the collection
<br>
of scientific evidence which will help inform society as to
<br>
&nbsp;the benefits, or otherwise, of GM technology,&quot; said Chris
<br>
&nbsp;Lamb, director of the John Innes Centre.
<br>
<p>Trespassers broke into the site early on Saturday 14 June,
<br>
slashed a large plastic tunnel and uprooted specimens 
<br>
growing inside. No one has admitted responsibility.   
<br>
<p>The incident coincides with the UK's ongoing public
<br>
discussion process on GM crops. The results will inform
<br>
the government's decision on whether to allow them to be
<br>
planted commercially. &quot;
<br>
-----------
<br>
<p>I've got to admit I'm developing a bit of a soft spot for the
<br>
'land of Ludd'. First the most liberal legislation around on
<br>
stem cells  (excepting perhaps China, which don't go in for 
<br>
that sort of thing, and are a bit iffy on IP as well), now what 
<br>
appears to be a genuine attempt to wrestle through a sound
<br>
position with respect to GMOs. Admittedly my warming up
<br>
to the Pommie attitude to biotech is not yet based on great
<br>
intimacy with the details of their GM debate (nor on the
<br>
incidents reported above). But it does seem the Brits are 
<br>
having a *real* discussion, well some of them.  Others are
<br>
just doing 'a spot of gardening'.
<br>
<p>Roll Britannia.
