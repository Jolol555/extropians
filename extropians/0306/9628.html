In a message dated 6/6/2003 3:44:31 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:jrd1415@yahoo.com?Subject=Re:%20[Iraq]%20The%20real%20reason%20for%20the%20war">jrd1415@yahoo.com</a> quotes MEZ: Hmmm.  I don't agree.  I think the large majority of  people in 
<br>
the middle east *like* western culture.  If anything, I think the right 
<br>
approach is to consciously export *more* western culture to this region - just not 
<br>
through tanks and cruise missiles. mez
<br>
<p>Then answers: I agree, mez.  I got sucked into the mass media demonization of 
<br>
islam that conflates militant islamic extremism with the whole of the islamic 
<br>
world. I'm inclined to accept your first person report that says Arabs (and 
<br>
by extension the rest of the islamic world) are regular people who, like 
<br>
regular people everywhere, find the American Dream irresistable.
<br>
<p>Jeff,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wouldn't you be more accurate if you described the media as being very 
<br>
reserved about the US?
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you made any great effort to find out what the people in the 
<br>
middle east do think or what kind of information is being fed them?  I think not.  
<br>
Every since 911 our President the people that work for him and our media has 
<br>
bent over backward to deliver a message that said that only a small percentage 
<br>
of Muslims have tried to harm us.  Heck the Iraqi Army quit so fast they are 
<br>
demanding we pay them -- they sure acted more like they were on our side more 
<br>
than Sadaam's.  In Afghanistan the Taliban and Al Qaida only required 185 
<br>
American servicemen on the ground to send them packing.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there is a fly in the ointment.  The leaders of those middle 
<br>
eastern countries and the upper crust that supports them have kept the man in the 
<br>
street so broke they are in immediate danger if their citizenry ever go over to 
<br>
the Americans.  If you check out the middle eastern media and the middle 
<br>
eastern sites available on line you will find the Arab man in the street is 
<br>
constantly being bombarded by a vicious propaganda campaign designed to induce 
<br>
hatred of America.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But MEZ gives us a way out.  He says, &quot;If anything, I think the right 
<br>
approach is to consciously export *more* western culture to this region - just 
<br>
not through tanks and cruise missiles. mez&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many cruise missiles have we fired at Egypt, Syria, and all the 
<br>
other countries other than one lone nation that was threatening us with gas?  We 
<br>
have fired none.  There leaders and through them their media made a simple 
<br>
decision. They looked at America and Sadaam then decided to support Sadaam.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?  Because if we are successful in up lifting Iraq their men in the 
<br>
street will see that and the leaders of the surrounding countries are gone.  
<br>
If they are lucky they will make it out of their own countries and on their 
<br>
way to France.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now we are back to MEZ.  Why does he oppose us?  No doubt because in 
<br>
some way he sees his future tied to the rulers of those same countries.  I have 
<br>
no way of telling how.  Maybe he just likes those people.  Maybe his family 
<br>
supports them.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But one thing is for sure, he has some reason for misrepresenting the 
<br>
conduct of the American government and trying to delegitimize us at every 
<br>
step.  He isn't doing this to win a merit badge so he can make Eagle Scout.
<br>
