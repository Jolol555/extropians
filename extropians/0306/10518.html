</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; Deliberately strive for modularity?  In a consilient universe?

<p><em>&gt; This is one of the reasons why I am not an academic...
</em><br>
<p>I am not sure this is really academia's strategy.  More likely, I think it
<br>
is simply a side-effect of the ever-increasing amount and complexity of
<br>
technology.  There is too much information for us to be able to know it all.
<br>
The Renaissance Man is dead.
<br>
<p>Today, people specialize into fields because they are already working more
<br>
than 40 hours a week in their particular subspecialty and still don't have
<br>
enough time.  Some focus on AI, some Security, others Star Dust.  I do not
<br>
think these specialties are smaller endeavors than scientists of previous
<br>
generations worked on.  Instead, I think the total sphere of technology has
<br>
grown such that these areas are now defined as modular, subsets, and
<br>
specialties, even though they are individually huge areas.
<br>
<p>As technology continues to escalate, I think all technology experts will
<br>
have to specialize into more and more modular subsections.  AI will
<br>
eventually fragment into various computer specialties.  Cryonics will
<br>
eventually fragment into various medical specialties.  Nanotechnology will
<br>
eventually fragment into various manufacturing specialties.  This seems to
<br>
be a natural side-effect of any advancing field, and not a strategy that can
<br>
be accepted or rejected.
