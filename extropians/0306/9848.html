Ok.  So far so good in my &quot;day-trading at the
<br>
library.&quot;  My ROI over the past year is right about
<br>
100% - I've doubled my money, simply by choosing
<br>
stocks of companies that looked undervalued and had
<br>
something new that looked solid that they were
<br>
bringing to market.
<br>
<p>Anyway, the rub is that if I sell at the points where
<br>
I might think I ought to, then I get to pay a large %
<br>
of any earnings in taxes.  Suggestions?  Note that I
<br>
am a real amateur in this area.
<br>
<p>My thoughts however trend in the direction of stock
<br>
&quot;trading,&quot; literally.  If I were to barter my shares
<br>
for shares that I felt would more securely hold value
<br>
at the point that I felt it was better to get out of a
<br>
particular stock, then, assuming a straight accross
<br>
trade, with no $ changing hands, I wouldn't owe any
<br>
income or capital gains, right?  Tell me if I'm wrong
<br>
here.
<br>
<p>So, suppose I were to create a company that offered
<br>
shares backed simply by money, at a guaranteed 1/1. 
<br>
I.e., I could at any future time know that my shares
<br>
would be worth at minimum - and maximum, probably -
<br>
the original face value in $, Euros, whatever.  As
<br>
such, these shares would themselves be easilly
<br>
tradable, essentially a replacement for paper dollars,
<br>
which could be used for bartering for other stocks or
<br>
commodities.
<br>
<p>So what's wrong with this nefarious scheme?  And how
<br>
could that be fixed?
