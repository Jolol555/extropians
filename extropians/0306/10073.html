<p>No no, I don't think that he quit because of *your* posts specifically, but
<br>
because of the predominant atmosphere of war support on the list. I did not
<br>
want to blame you personally, I just wanted to know
<br>
if I have missed some statements of those people who must have an *official*
<br>
interest, that extropiansm is presented in the right light.
<br>
<p>If you now mention some names from the board of directors who have outlined
<br>
their opinion that the war was extropian, I know what I have to think about
<br>
extropianism now. It is an intellectual waterhole every once in a while, but
<br>
as a moral institution or even a source of human or even transhuman
<br>
development it has worn out the moment it's representatives have supported
<br>
this war of aggression and still have not reevaluated it's judgement in the
<br>
face of the recent presentation of White House Weapons of Truth Destruction
<br>
(WTD).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for the reasons this War was Extropic, as I said Greg Burch posted
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasons he felt it was, additionaly, both Robert Bradbury and Lee Corbin
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have posted reasons why this war could be considered extropic and just, as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have I.  I will not, however, repost it because I doubt you will be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; interested in reasonably debating each point, since you have never showed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any inclination to do so in the past.
</em><br>
<p>Until the enforced diplomacy started in the Iraq desert I have been
<br>
discussing the topic reasonably with all the informational strength and
<br>
moral implication and passion I was able to contribute, but I realized it
<br>
was useless. Nobody was able to convince anybody from the other side so I
<br>
jumped off the train and refuse to discuss this any longer. But I observe
<br>
your
<br>
(plural) opinions and  from time to time I might make a sarcastic comment.
<br>
That's all.
<br>
<p>humania, who knew in advance that fighting against the dragon he would
<br>
become a dragon, too.
