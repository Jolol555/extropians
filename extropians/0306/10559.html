<em>&gt;     &gt; It [911] brought out the current policies to light, didn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; If you think 911 will ever lead the American people to demand their

<em>&gt; government have a more sympathetic policy toward Palestine then you must be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; smoking some very funny cigarettes.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>It had better have a more sympathetic policy.  The current one is leading to 
<br>
mass oppression of the Palestinian people and occupation of their lands.   We 
<br>
have supported this and attendant Israeli atrocities for far too long.  We 
<br>
cannot speak for peace and justice in the region effectively without speaking 
<br>
up for the Palestinian people.   Only those &quot;smoking funny cigarrettes&quot; could 
<br>
miss or continue to ignore something this obvious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;    &gt;There's documented proof all over the place of Israeli's human rights
</em><br>
<em>&gt;    &gt;violations
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sure there is, big deal.
</em><br>
<p>Big Deal??!!!  This is the most cynical uncaring thing you could possibly say.  
<br>
It is a very big deal when a country, especially one we support, practices 
<br>
such gross violations.  One of the major justifciations for the invasion of 
<br>
Iraq and outster of Saddam was his human rights violations and violations of 
<br>
UN sanctions.  Israel has many times as many UN sanction violations and they 
<br>
are our good buddies that we generally can say no evil about.  This is gross 
<br>
hypocrisy and no one will take our intentions toward peace in the region 
<br>
seriously as long as we continue it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The world is full of injustice and every people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; has had bad things happen to them and Palestinians are no exception, but if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you want to explain the unprecedented volcanic rage consuming the entire
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Islamic world from Algeria to Indonesia you're going to have to come up
</em><br>
<p>What would you feel but rage when your people are oppressed for 50 years or a 
<br>
subset of your people are so oppressed and the nation that postures about 
<br>
human rights and freedom not only says and does nothing but supports and 
<br>
praises the oppressor?   When that nation then says it has the right to 
<br>
invade a nation in the region  without UN support and to attack persons, 
<br>
resources and installations in any nation that it considers a threat without 
<br>
any due process required, do you expect the people to remain calm?  When 
<br>
Americans justify this behavior without for a minute seeing the other side 
<br>
should you be surprised they hold you in contempt?  
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; with some unprecedented horror inflicted on all of Islam (not just the tiny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; percentage that is Palestinian) the likes of which no other people have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experienced
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the history of the world; and after that you need to explain why Jews
</em><br>
<em>&gt; don't crash airliners into German skyscrapers.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>No.  You need to take a crash course in honest appraisal of exactly what this 
<br>
country and our good friends have been up to in the middle east.  You also 
<br>
need to stop blaming the entire Arab/Muslim world for one terrorist incident.  
<br>
I have been continuously attempting to get you and others to do this for 
<br>
nearly two years and you continue to have your heads in the sand while you 
<br>
show your ass to the rest of the world.  It is despicable and not the least 
<br>
extropic.
