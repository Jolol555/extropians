<em>&gt; &gt; We seem to get so oriented toward the hard sciences that we forget
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; there is a whole world of philosophy, political science, theology and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; goodness knows what else out in the real world that is derived and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; discussed in a rational and reason based way.  Science can lay claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to much, but... being the only reason-based field is not a claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; science can sustain.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; We fall for every con artist that comes along with three shells and a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; pea once we get outside the field of hard science.  We truly need a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; broader education for our scientists -- a scientist has to fill many
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; roles besides scientist.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Let me suggest the main problem is that people don't realize that there really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are such things as social sciences, which can be just as &quot;scientific&quot; as other
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;sciences&quot;, but are far less deferred to.
</em><br>
<p>But we've been led astray so many times, especially during
<br>
social sciences' birth in the last century.  Recall all
<br>
the theories of Skinner and Watson, for starters.  And Mead
<br>
was swallowed whole for generations.  Yes, I suppose that
<br>
a &quot;maturing&quot; has occurred, and that what I am saying could
<br>
have been aimed (once long ago) at Galileo and Kepler.
<br>
<p>So what about the old adage the social sciences truly are
<br>
more difficult?  Also the observation that it is vastly
<br>
harder to uproot someone's beliefs about human nature (e.g.
<br>
The Blank Slate), than it is to disprove the claims about
<br>
N-rays or cold fusion?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The public can read that a physicist says some weird thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; or another and the usual reaction is &quot;how fascinating, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; didn't know that&quot;, even if they have little idea what it means,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; but if a social scientist says some well established thing
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that goes against popular wishes, such as that a minimum wage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; raises unemployment, the reaction will be a quick dismissal.
</em><br>
<p>Of course, you understand the reasons for that---the &quot;fascinating&quot;
<br>
little science fact does not conflict with an entire world-view,
<br>
and can be easily absorbed.  But beliefs about many social issues
<br>
appear to stand and fall together.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Alas, one of the myths of democracy is that there should be no social
</em><br>
<em>&gt; experts, so that every thought that occurs to anyone on social issues
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is as valid as anything any &quot;expert&quot; says.  It's just not so.
</em><br>
<p>Quite right.  But I for one occasionally still find social science
<br>
experiments not persuasive, for one reason or another, (forget
<br>
behaviorism or leftist anthropology).  Do you believe the Zimbardo
<br>
effect?  It has to remain the last word, because no one can ethically
<br>
ever again repeat the experiment.  I suspect---but can never know---
<br>
that the experimenter allowed his personal participation and priming
<br>
of his subjects to interfere with the conclusions.
