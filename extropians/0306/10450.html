Very true. I didn't mean to state the program as &quot;truth&quot; since without being
<br>
there, the truth can never be known. Only educated guesses. My point was
<br>
that most people don't even have a clue.
<br>
Currently I am reading &quot;Origins&quot; by Leakey and there is quite a bit that has
<br>
been &quot;learned&quot; since the book was published in 1979. The &quot;family tree&quot; has
<br>
taken a variety of shapes over the years, but both do agree however that
<br>
Neanderthal man is not a direct ancestor. Careful analysis of the proteins
<br>
has shown this and I doubt that we will ever learn otherwise. For this
<br>
reason, I have to accept this as the &quot;truth of the moment&quot; just as much as I
<br>
have to accept that cigarette smoking is harmful to my health. One day, this
<br>
may be proven wring as well, but it is not very likely.

<em>&gt; &gt; I watched it, the watched it again a second time while I recorded it.
</em><br>
It's
<br>
<em>&gt; great to have something out there that explains the evolutionary history
</em><br>
of
<br>
<em>&gt; human beings in laymen's terms. I had 6 people (all of whom think I am
</em><br>
nuts)
<br>
<em>&gt; watch this. If there is one thing they all got out of it, it was the fact
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that Neanderthal man is NOT our ancestor, but an entirely different
</em><br>
species!
<br>
<em>&gt; I am starting to check around right now, but it seems to me that the
</em><br>
common
<br>
<em>&gt; misconception is that we descended from Neanderthal man. After viewing
</em><br>
this
<br>
<em>&gt; program, all 6 of these people are more inclined to listen to what I have
</em><br>
to
<br>
<em>&gt; say about evolution vs. creation. They simply had no idea how it worked!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Until seeing this program, one of my friends (and possibly more)
</em><br>
actually
<br>
<em>&gt; thought that man descended from what is, for lack of a better word, modern
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ape. Once again, the Discovery channel has opened a few minds!!!!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Three cheers for the Discovery Channel!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I also enjoyed what I saw of the program, and plan to eventually watch it
</em><br>
in
<br>
<em>&gt; its entirety.  However, I would not take what they say as carved in stone
</em><br>
<em>&gt; truth.  Every week some grand revelation issues forth from the mills of
</em><br>
the
<br>
<em>&gt; press via some study. But many of those studies are flawed.  Truth is
</em><br>
always
<br>
<em>&gt; being revised, and it seems that we have a short memory considering how
</em><br>
often
<br>
<em>&gt; studies that are promoted as carved in stone truth are refuted a few years
</em><br>
<em>&gt; later.  Evolutionary biology is great stuff, but I would not be surprised
</em><br>
if
<br>
<em>&gt; what we saw in the aforementioned TV show is revised with a decade or 2.
