<p><em>&gt; I don't mind discussing this with you; I just didn't see where you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; were going with your questions.  Care to rephrase?
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I'll give it another try.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. What proportion of human beings in the United States would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    you guess to be Bayesians?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; There has never been and will never be an exact Bayesian - it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; is computationally intractable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;Ah yes, I should have said *non-exact* Bayesians!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It all depends on how close you look.  From a distance people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; roughly Bayesian in many ways.
</em><br>
<p>Yes.  But it's difficult to conceive how it could have
<br>
turned out differently.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But if you look real close at particular decisions you can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certainly see a lot of error, and sometimes you can also see
</em><br>
<em>&gt; systematic deviations.  So how big a deviation is &quot;big&quot;?
</em><br>
<p>All right.  So no Bayesians per se exist, but it's an ideal
<br>
that one speaks about, such as &quot;rational&quot;.  No exactly rational
<br>
people exist either.  But for rational, we are able to reasonably
<br>
assert that, for example, one nation's population is more rational
<br>
than another nations (on perhaps a particular restriction).
<br>
<p>But I don't get the parallel for &quot;Bayesian&quot;.  I use Bayes theorem
<br>
a lot in solving probability problems, have solved all the ones
<br>
I've seen on this list both intuitively (mathematically), and
<br>
formally (mathematically).  I have always preferred the point
<br>
of view that readily accepts or postulates, or even agitates
<br>
for prior distributions, and goes right ahead with probability
<br>
calculus.  So who is more Bayesian than I am?
<br>
<p>What is the utility that you and the researchers find in referring
<br>
to a class of such agents by that description?  (Eliezer once wrote
<br>
&quot;[Vorlon voice:] We are all Bayesians now.&quot;)
<br>
<p>A semantic analysis by context appears to show that it is being
<br>
used as a substitute for &quot;clear-thinking&quot;, or &quot;rational&quot;, or some
<br>
blend of such familiar concepts.  It frankly sounds silly to me,
<br>
but (a) I did miss out on a lot of earlier Extropian and other
<br>
list discussions about this  (b) if enough people I trust really
<br>
say the Emperor has clothes, then it's probably so, but *I* still
<br>
can't see them.
