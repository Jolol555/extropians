</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;pointer states&quot;, but it sounds like you are 
<br>
being a strict frequentist about the interpretation of probability, so that 
<br>
you refuse to assign a probability to an event, such as the US invading 
<br>
Iran in the next two years, where there won't be a large number of similar 
<br>
events.  I hope you realize just how few events you can assign 
<br>
probabilities to when you take this approach.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;It looks to me like you're trying to extrapolate back my pointer state to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;a prior that I never actually had, that is poorly defined (what is the set 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;of observers?), and where many of the members of the so-called &quot;reference 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt;exist depending on present-day choices.  Why should I extrapolate back to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;this prior I never had, to this non-naturalistic object, especially if it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;is ill-defined?
</em><br>
<p>I do not defend analysis in terms of a &quot;reference class&quot;, and dislike its 
<br>
ambiguity just as you do.  But this is a separate issue from whether it 
<br>
makes sense to talk about what priors would make sense for baby-Eliezer, 
<br>
who did not know many of the things that you do now, or what other contexts 
<br>
it might make sense to think about priors in.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;... &quot;What were your priors before you were born?&quot; questions are often 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;ill-defined, and so they often give ill-defined answers.  Asking whether 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;pointer state recalibrations obey Bayes' Theorem when they are 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;extrapolated backward in time to before my birth strikes me as an 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;unnaturalistic thing to do.  Should I really give a hoot whether I was a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;good Bayesian before I actually existed?  ...
</em><br>
<p>I'm not sure what you mean by &quot;unnaturalistic&quot;; it is such a bad thing to 
<br>
be?  Probability, decision, and game theory are choc full of 
<br>
counterfactuals.  If you are going to be disinterested in something because 
<br>
it is counterfactual, you might as well give up on all of it.  Of course 
<br>
people do seem to find it easier to make more sense of some counterfactuals 
<br>
than of others.  FYI, the following paper of mine seems to go farther into 
<br>
counterfactual territory than most theorists are willing to.

<br>
<p>If two Bayesians believe that the causal process which produced their priors
<br>
was just as likely to have assigned them each the other Bayesian's prior,
<br>
those priors must be the same.  Also, if two Bayesians agree on how much
<br>
some event changes the chances that they would have been created with the
<br>
same or different priors, those priors must assign the same probability to
<br>
that event.  Thus Bayesians who agree enough about the causal origins of
<br>
their priors must have the same priors.
