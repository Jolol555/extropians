<p>Really, such butchery to produce an artificial relief rather than facing and 
<br>
dealing with the feelings does seem rather contemptible.  Not that I am 
<br>
saying guilt is a good thing but rather that getting done with it is an 
<br>
important part of growth and self-responsibility.   It has nothing to do with 
<br>
religion to disapprove of such misuse of technology.

<p>No, it doesn't.  Not if it is dealt with intelligently.
