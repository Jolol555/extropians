<p><em>&gt; You might tell your girlfriend that she is average among the girlfriends

</em><br>
<em>&gt; the products you sell are average, and that your in-group is no more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morally justified than any other group.  You might rarely disagree, and 
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Some of this seems to be demonstrating a distinction between seeking
<br>
the truth and speaking the truth.  You may know these things without
<br>
telling anyone about them.
<br>
<p>The real question is, can you be honest with yourself.  That is what
<br>
truth-seeking means to me.  You may or may not choose to be completely
<br>
frank with everyone else, but that's a completely different matter.
<br>
The question is whether you should, in your own mind, try to learn and
<br>
know the truth.
<br>
<p>Some of the points you raise do demonstrate costs to this approach.
<br>
You may not be a good liar, and you may not be as socially effective if
<br>
your beliefs do not match your actions.  But I suspect that this handicap
<br>
can be overcome, or at least minimized.  You say that salesmen who believe
<br>
in their products do best, but a good salesman could learn to act like
<br>
his product is terrific, even though he knows secretly that it is not.
<br>
I've seen effective salesmen of both types.
<br>
<p>And I think most of us have learned to maintain this kind of split
<br>
to some degree, in our relationships.  You may well have a different
<br>
opinion about your girlfriend than what you lead her to believe.  I'll bet
<br>
most people do, to some extent.  Similarly most of us are probably not
<br>
completely frank with the boss, co-workers, other family members, and
<br>
most casual friends.  Humans have evolved considerable skill at these
<br>
kinds of deceptions.  Lying to yourself is not a necessary prerequisite.
