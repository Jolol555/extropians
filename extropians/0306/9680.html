MMB said:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I don't think this situation has a tidy solution; nor a quick one, apart 
<br>
from the Albigensian approach (&quot;Kill them all; God will know his own&quot;, in 
<br>
the apocryphal wording). This is grievous.&gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>My sense is that this policy is not kin to some medieval monk's view of the 
<br>
world and human interaction. Rather, this is a cold-blooded analysis of what 
<br>
our opponents say, 
<br>
and seem to believe, and act upon. Denial of civilizational differences will 
<br>
not stand the light of day. Its not simply what we or you, MMB want, it what 
<br>
the other fellows tell each other, as Claude Shannon, said decades ago. 
<br>
<p>What we are facing is the real threat of nuclear guerilla warfare. The threat 
<br>
is serious and is driven by money from oil, nationalism, and especially 
<br>
religious-political radical Islam. Now how are we to respond? If you disagree that 
<br>
there is a factual threat then, 9-11 never happened.  Our enemies abroad, 
<br>
whether Muslim or not will identify themselves by their actions. The problem is 
<br>
that the US has consistently turned the other cheek, only to enhance beliefs 
<br>
that we will collapse, under attack. And you know, that could really happen.
<br>
<p>But our enemies are far from invincible and have weaknesses we need to 
<br>
exploit. Sometimes it is the military way, similar to Afghanistan and Iraq. Other 
<br>
means may be supporting regime opponents, opening up dialogues with those that 
<br>
seem persuadable, and slowly educating the Muslim Street so that they are given 
<br>
a choice on what is factual, rather then just the government line, as in 
<br>
Saudi, Egypt, and several other states.
<br>
<p>MMB, you always quote science fiction writer, David Brin (I believe) at the 
<br>
end of your signature on these posts. Yes, you are indeed here as part of a 
<br>
civilization; and that civilization is under attack by a coalition of the 
<br>
vicious, the greedy, the selfish, and the antidemocratic. This conflict will succeed 
<br>
the W. Bush administration by 8-10 years, I am guessing. Another 
<br>
administration will be faced with the same problem as the current one. In this respect, 
<br>
this conflict is just like WW3, also known as the Cold War.  You come here as 
<br>
part of a civilization, now what steps do you recommend to defend it?
<br>
<p>Very, Sincerely
<br>
<p>Mitch
