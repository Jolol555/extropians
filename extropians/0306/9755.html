Pardon me for interjecting,
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The bench scientists are probably lurking, waiting in hope (&amp; desperation)
<br>
to unearth the occasional posts about science &amp; technology amongst all the
<br>
political ranting. 
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
The ideological stuff is rather off-putting &amp; seems besides the point.

Brett, what is disturbing to me is my sense of how few bench researchers
<br>
have interest in Transhumanism or cryo, or uploading. Maybe its too new a
<br>
concept for them. Or maybe we are all deluded and everything is hopeless, or
<br>
maybe there are other answers. (No I am NOT making a stealth attempt to pimp
<br>
religion here!).
<br>
<p>When I first climbed aboard the Extropian list, I was hoping to see some
<br>
scientists promoting Transhumanism, some cosmologists or astronomers writing
<br>
about new, wondrous, essays; such as Moravec or Tipler. Basically, it ain't
<br>
happening and I am not sure why this is?  But we seem to have a dearth of
<br>
interested theorists. Harvey Newstrom had a similar question about this last
<br>
week.  I dunno.  :-(
<br>
<p><p>Brett stated:
<br>
&lt;&lt;I wonder then if Einstein would regard those who seek to avoid 
<br>
total personal annihilation not through religion or superstition but 
<br>
through the scientific pursuit of life extension, uploading, cryonics 
<br>
etc as feeble souls and ridiculous egoists? 
<br>
<p>I don't think most transhumanists would think of themselves as
<br>
&quot;feeble souls&quot; and &quot;ridiculous egoists&quot;. 
<br>
<p>I'm an atheist, but the psychology of believing is easier for me to
<br>
explain than the psychology of disbelieving. I can see how believing
<br>
and hoping for some sort of personal survival and continuance 
<br>
however irrationally, could be an evolutionary advantage enabling
<br>
one to pass on one's genes, yet disbelieving in all forms of personal
<br>
continuation seems to be self defeating mechanism more likely to 
<br>
instil depression and hopelessness.&gt;&gt;
