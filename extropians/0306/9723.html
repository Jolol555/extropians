<em>&gt; &gt; People who swear to citizenship are entering a contract with the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rest of us to honor and respect that constitution and its content.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What about those who are just born? (A genuine question, I'm not sure
</em><br>
<em>&gt; how it fits in to this scheme unless everyone has to make such an
</em><br>
<em>&gt; undertaking on reaching a certain age).
</em><br>
<p>Natural born citizens? In many states, registering to vote includes
<br>
such a clause. I personally prefer the idea of earning full
<br>
citizenship, but such an idea would never fly here, you'd have to start
<br>
a new country somewhere to  do that. Citizenship gained too easily is
<br>
valued too cheaply.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;Everyone is entitled to their opinion&quot; is such a cop out. Do you
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that monarchists should bring the monarchy back to Italy?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Perhaps the Pope should rule Italy like he used to? Or the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Spanish? Perhaps the Nazis should run Germany once more...
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; There are some opinions which, while people are entitled to them,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; cannot be permitted to find fertile ground to take root in reality.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What?! There are monarchists in Italy (and several other European
</em><br>
<em>&gt; republics) who are fully at liberty to put their views. Do you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; think they shouldn't be able to? Who or what is going to &quot;not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; permit&quot; certain views &quot;to find fertile ground to take root in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reality&quot;? And whence comes the power to &quot;permit&quot;, which logically 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; implies a power to forbid?
</em><br>
<p>Did you not read that which you snipped? If holders of unconstitutional
<br>
opinions wish to foist their opinions on us in reality, they are free
<br>
to do so so long as they follow constititonally presecribed methods.
<br>
<p>I don't know what means there is to alter constitutions of Italy or any
<br>
other european nation. If it takes a simple majority vote, that is your
<br>
choice and your country, you are free to do so. Here in the US, we
<br>
raised the bar a little bit higher so that idiots, tyrants, and fools
<br>
could not destroy the experiment too easily.
