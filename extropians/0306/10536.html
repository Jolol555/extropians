</em><br>

<em>&gt; A *contribution* to knowledge does not equal an *explanation*.  If you 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are studying field B that depends on field A, and you happen to believe 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A2 while most people believe A1, it is not enough for you to show that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; A2 leads to B2; you should also show what A1 leads to.  If A1 leads to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; B1, you should say so.    You are not saying anything false or 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; misleading by doing this.  You are allowing progress and the division of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; labor to continue without requiring that everyone agree with you on 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything.
</em><br>
<p>If we suppose the Singularity to be wrong, then we have no idea what the 
<br>
next century will bring; hence, not enough information to even try and be 
<br>
clever about what we believe.  Ergo, since we can't measure the possibly 
<br>
catastrophic cost of self-deception, rationality seems like the safest course.
<br>
<p>I have a problem with saying:  &quot;But what if people who confidently believe 
<br>
that things will go on just as before are right?&quot;  That's not a simple 
<br>
counterfactual because it strikes at the heart of one of the basic issues 
<br>
of rationality - lack of confidence that basic beliefs are right, the 
<br>
future being different from the past.  This is not just hypothesizing an 
<br>
alternate future scenario; it is hypothesizing that beliefs don't need to 
<br>
change as much as they do and are more reliable than they are.  It is one 
<br>
thing to ask about *different changes*, but to counterfactual on *no 
<br>
changes* is to start out by denying one of the chief things that makes 
<br>
rationality instrumentally necessary to arbitrary coherent goals.
