</em><br>

<p>You said in response to Max Plumm:
<br>
<p>Max Plumm said, amongst other things...
<br>
&quot; This is even more appalling when one considers that every civilian life
<br>
lost in Iraq could've been saved had Saddam Hussein simply relinquished
<br>
power by the time of the U.S. imposed deadline. &quot;
<br>
<p>This is the second time you've said this in the last day or two. You don't
<br>
also say &quot;This is even more appalling when one considers that every civilian
<br>
life lost in Iraq could've been saved had the coalition of the willing not
<br>
attacked in the first place.&quot; Why not?
<br>
<p>Emlyn
<br>
<p>To which I responded:
<br>
<p>He probably didnt say that because it is completely absurd.
<br>
<p>It is difficult for me to even began to coalesce the reasons why such a
<br>
statement is repulsive to me as an extropian and an person who values human
<br>
life.  Regardless of your opposition to the Iraq war, had the goal of the
<br>
coalition been simple to remove Saddam just because they wanted to, this
<br>
would have *still* had more moral validity than a murderous dictator
<br>
remaining in power, simply because he was a murderous dictator.  Dictators
<br>
have *no right* to be dictators!
<br>
<p>Every single person who died in the coalition war did so ONLY because Saddam
<br>
did not want to give up his control over the 20 million or so people of
<br>
Iraq.  Please explain to me your ethical principles that place his choice in
<br>
this conflict of staying in power and opposing the coalition efforts in a
<br>
morally valid catagory.  I simply can not fathom how any extropian can
<br>
consider Saddam's actions in this situation as morally valid.  Given his
<br>
past track record of murder, future likely hood of murder, track record of
<br>
wars and aggressiveness, systematic effort to wipe out the kurds, slaughter
<br>
of some 50,000 shiites, suspicions of harboring WMD, economic control
<br>
resulting in the untolds thousands of deaths, etc. etc I can not even began
<br>
to understand how you place the moral culpability of those deaths on the
<br>
people attempting to STOP that, instead of the person choosing and insisting
<br>
that he must continue it.
<br>
<p>To which you did not respond.
<br>
<p>Just to clarify, I shall ask you the same question I asked Damien, and you
<br>
can choose to not answer as he has of course.
<br>
<p>Is Saddam Hussain morally culpable for the deaths of the civilians in the
<br>
Coalition lead effort to remove said murderous tyrant from power, or is the
<br>
coalition morally culpable?
