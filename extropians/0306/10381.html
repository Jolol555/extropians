<p>I agree that people do on occasion lie.  But I don't think they are really
<br>
capable of lying most of the time.  It is just too hard to maintain in your
<br>
head both what you really think and what you would think if you were the
<br>
person you project.
<br>
<p>Do any of you think that you consistently lie in what you post to this list?
<br>
Do you even think you could do so, and maintain your interest in being here?
<br>
<p>Consider how damn hard it is to be a good actor.  There are a few people
<br>
who can convincingly project a very different persona from who they are,
<br>
but they are few and far between.  Most of us completely fail.
