In a message dated 6/11/2003 12:45:55 PM Central Standard Time,

<a href="mailto:mail@HarveyNewstrom.com?Subject=Re:%20META:%20%20Dishonest%20debate%20(was%20&quot;cluster%20bombs&quot;)">mail@HarveyNewstrom.com</a> writes: Secondly, your repeated ad hominem against Amara violates 
<br>
the list rules and should stop.  There is no evidence that Amara hates America 
<br>
or listens to those who do.  Your level of emotion and insult is out of 
<br>
proportion to Amara's calm and rational style.  You are adding unnecessary heat and 
<br>
emotion into the debate.  Whether you agree with me or not, this is in the 
<br>
list rules that you agreed to follow when you joined the list.
<br>
<p>Harvey,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for the lecture.  Please look up Amara's original post on the 
<br>
subject of Cluster bombs on the archives.  You have lectured me in the past on 
<br>
how to use the archives so I am sure you can handle that.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you will check the archives you will find Amara accused the US of 
<br>
&quot;carpet bombing&quot; with cluster bombs.  If you look that up you will find that 
<br>
carpet bombing is something that is very large scale relative to what actually 
<br>
happened.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also claimed, &quot;It is dishonest to blame Amara for this 
<br>
misunderstanding when it is you who changed positions after the evidence was presented.&quot;  
<br>
You based your attack on my having said, &quot;We haven't had those targets and 
<br>
hence have not used the weapons.&quot;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We apparently have not had the targets for &quot;carpet bombing&quot; and we 
<br>
have not used that weapon.  If you wish to insist on tactic or strategy instead 
<br>
of target then go ahead.  You might be able to make that case.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that I don't think either of you have been dishonest.  You 
<br>
have merely been overly quick in loading on when you found someone denigrating 
<br>
the US.  I do suggest your having done so reveals a state of mind.
<br>
Ron h.
