<p>
The psychological problem that most people have
<br>
against uploading, of course, is that of &quot;being
<br>
inside a computer&quot;, or of knowing that one is really
<br>
just on a silicon chip.
<br>
<p>A theme that probably should (and so probably has)
<br>
been stressed by SF writers, and any of those of us
<br>
who engage in discussions with the unconverted, is
<br>
the attendant near-omniscience it would provide.
<br>
<p>Recall the computer vision experiments that prove
<br>
that one is only looking at a tiny area when one
<br>
has the impression that he or she is seeing with
<br>
clarity every word on a page.  This impression is
<br>
strengthened, of course, by the seemingly instantaneous
<br>
reaction of the brain to eye movement.  The freedom
<br>
to look anywhere in your field of vision translates
<br>
to awareness of nearly half the space you're in.
<br>
<p>Now imagine a trillion cameras throughout the Earth
<br>
and solar system, equally responsive to you in a 
<br>
similar way.  Yes, you can see the insides of 
<br>
particular machines that are running you, or at
<br>
least their cases, but you can also see all the
<br>
locations at which you used to live, all the cities,
<br>
mountains, deserts, and faraway moons and planets.
<br>
And you need do no more than, so it seems, move
<br>
your eyes.
<br>
<p>Cries of freedom, knowledge, and liberation from
<br>
provincialism will issue from the first truly
<br>
uploaded, and will go far to persuade their brethren
<br>
of the advantages.
<br>
