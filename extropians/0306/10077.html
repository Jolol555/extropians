<em>&gt; -----Original Message-----
</em><br>
<em>&gt; From: Olga Bourlin

<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; As this list discussed the Atkins diet not long ago, I am 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; forwarding this post from my Quackwatch list FYI (I have no 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; opinion on the Atkins diet myself, and have never tried it 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and don't diet ... at least to lose weight). The bottom part 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the post makes the claim that the diet doesn't work, the 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; top part is in response to that claim:
</em><br>
<p>[Choosing topics for response almost at random here this morning ...]
<br>
<p>Since I began this topic with a narrative about some personal
<br>
experiences recently, I'll make these observations.  My weight loss was
<br>
much greater (in percentage terms) than that described in the
<br>
&quot;anti-Atkins&quot; studies quoted in Olga's post, and, at least six weeks
<br>
after hitting my target weight, my post-diet experience has been that I
<br>
have NOT regained any of the weight, despite having returned to a much
<br>
more &quot;normal&quot; diet.
<br>
<p>A comment on what my post-target diet has been.  I've gone back to
<br>
eating carbs and sugar in roughly half my meals.  Two or three times per
<br>
week I've been all but gorging on carbs and sugar, in keeping with my
<br>
generally sensualist personality.  Despite this, and a somewhat reduced
<br>
level of exercise during the same period, I'm maintaining my target
<br>
weight.
