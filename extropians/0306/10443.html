<p>No, you understood me the first time.  I didn't mean that it would FULLY
<br>
slip my mind: I merely mean that it can get far enough out of mind that it
<br>
doesn't trigger those reflexes (twitching, eye shifting, increased heart
<br>
rate, etc.) that signal &quot;lying&quot; to other people.
<br>
<p>If we really did FULLY forget, then, you're right, it would be
<br>
self-deception.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt;I might add that your claim that most people seem to be mostly

</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I've heard that argument against the possibility of detecting self-deception
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and reject it.  If you read the literature on self-deception it becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; clear that it is a real phenomena that we can in fact reliably detect in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; many circumstances.
</em><br>
<p>This argument isn't an epistemological one, (like Quine's similar argument
<br>
from radical translation,) it's a logical one.  The claim is that, while
<br>
you can detect self-deception in relatively rare individual cases, you
<br>
can't correctly say of a group of individuals engaged in discourse that
<br>
most of them are by-and-large wrong most of the time.  The reason for this
<br>
is couched in the notion of &quot;radical interpretation&quot;, which Quine took to
<br>
be an epistemic limit, but which a Davidsonian takes to be a metaphysical
<br>
argument about propositions in general: they just can't go wrong THAT
<br>
badly, because to do so, they'd have to be wrong on somebody's
<br>
interpretation (even if an omniscient interpretation), but all such
<br>
interpretations must be done with charity.
<br>
<p>Self-deception is real, but you must take yourself to have misunderstood
<br>
us if you think that we're ALL lying to *everyone*, including ourselves.
