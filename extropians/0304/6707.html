And the English papers aren't used by the ruling class to lead the man 
<br>
in the street?  I can tell what the papers say.  And I can usually tell 
<br>
who they are speaking to.  But telling how truthful they are being at 
<br>
any one time is a much more difficult problem.  I do know that news in 
<br>
the US is processed (almost always) for entertainment value.  Sometimes 
<br>
for political value instead, but more usually the political value is 
<br>
secondary to the entertainment value.  Truth falls into a distant fourth 
<br>
place.  (Selling things is usually third.)  And I know that I tend to 
<br>
judge the news from other countries by the same standard, but with a 
<br>
great deal less certainty that I'm correct.  I've never observed 
<br>
something there, and then later seen it reported, so I have only an 
<br>
intuitive calibration.
<br>
<p>But I do know that even in the US local news frequently has vastly 
<br>
different opinions about things (not only about what it means, but about 
<br>
how important it is, and even about what happened).  And this new rarely 
<br>
shows up anywhere on the web.  So I suspect that our knowledge of things 
<br>
which we only see in translation is ... did you ever play the game 
<br>
&quot;Telephone?&quot;  Did you ever read the Eric Frank Russell story titled &quot;Top 
<br>
Secret&quot;?  If so, you know what I mean, if not, I can only say I expect 
<br>
that a lot is ... transformed ... during the generational copying.  I'm 
<br>
not implying any motive, or even direction to the transformation.  
<br>
Merely a degradation of accuracy that verges on the extreme, this in a 
<br>
channel that didn't start out as any shining example of a low noise 
<br>
transmission medium.
