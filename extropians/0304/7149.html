Eliezer S. Yudkowsky:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Furthermore, allocating the burden of proof to one side or the other,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in advance, restricts your spirit of creative inquiry.  In the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beginning Hugh M. Species should simply examine these new dairy and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; grain products to see what they are, gathering information, not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; immediately launching a war between one position and the other. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Perhaps neither position is correct. 
</em><br>
<p>Who said anything about &quot;launching a war,&quot; Eliezer?
<br>
<p>It is a basic fact of science that burden-of-proof is on whoever makes the
<br>
claim, i.e., on whoever proposes a new working hypothesis. For example, as I
<br>
wrote in another message, the burden of proof was on Einstein to show his
<br>
theories were more complete than Newton's -- it was not on Newton to rise
<br>
from the grave to disprove Einstein. This is how progress happens in
<br>
science. There is nothing non-bayesian or war-like about it. 
<br>
<p>Our man Mr. Hugh M. Species in the year ~12,000 B.C. is suddenly faced one
<br>
morning with the claims of dairy and agricultural farmers who say he should
<br>
deviate from the diet upon which he evolved over ~4,000,000 years. If Mr.
<br>
Hugh M. Species is rational and concerned for his health then he will want
<br>
first to see evidence to support the farmers' claims. 
<br>
<p>This does not mean Mr. Hugh M. Species cannot or should not volunteer to do
<br>
the research himself in an effort to find the evidence on behalf of his new
<br>
farmer friends, nor does it mean there are going to be bitter feelings or
<br>
hostilities involved. 
<br>
<p>It is simply the way gentlemen do their science. 
<br>
