<p>And you seem to be missing the point I was trying to make, which was that

cultures in which people get a large % of their calories from meat are NOT

Paleolithic cultures but rather modern HG cultures.

<p><em>&gt;Homo did not appear on the American

</em><br>
<p>Precisely.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; As for hunting being unlikely because it's difficult without a gun, well,
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I don't know whether I failed abysmally at communicating or if you're
<br>
deliberately misrepresenting what I wrote. Let's take a look at the
<br>
evidence. I wrote: &quot;But I do find it difficult to believe that early humans
<br>
with no hunting gear more sophisticated than the spear could have gotten a
<br>
large % of calories from meat.&quot; Should I have spelled out the fact that
<br>
there were many advances in hunting technology in relatively recent times?
<br>
(recent in the evolutionary sense; it's clear from your comments above that
<br>
you understand the term &quot;recent&quot; in this context) The atlatl, for example.
<br>
The bow and arrow. Are you suggesting that bows and arrows are no more
<br>
sophisticated than spears? Or that there are only two levels of hunting
<br>
technology -- spears and guns?
