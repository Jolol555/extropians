</em><br>
<p>This is common in anthropological circles.  It is also held by many
<br>
linguists.  For an example of a linguist agreement with this
<br>
conjecture, see
<br>
<a href="http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~compi/pub/spoken_language/ch1.pdf">http://www.esat.kuleuven.ac.be/~compi/pub/spoken_language/ch1.pdf</a>
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; You're right that there is no firm proof that this was when 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; grammatical language arose, but the circumstantial evidence 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; appears to have convinced most anthropologists.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I'd love to know what this circumstantial evidence is.
</em><br>
<p>There's evidence from both anthropology and genetics.
<br>
<p>1) 40 - 50,000 years ago there is a sudden shift in human culture.  At
<br>
that time we very suddenly see:
<br>
<p>- The widespread appearance of art.  This is the first real evidence
<br>
for symbolic thinking in humans.  Prior to about 40,000 years ago,
<br>
there is no archeological evidence of symbolic thinking.  
<br>
<p>- The design of the first complex (multi-part) tools.
<br>
<p>- The first /reproduced/ tool designs.  Prior to this point each stone
<br>
or bone tool we find is fairly idiosyncratic.  After about 50k years
<br>
ago we suddenly find many tools built from several pieces and in the
<br>
exact same way.
<br>
<p>- A noticeable increase in life expectancy.
<br>
<p>All of these lead us to believe that human culture of this time took a
<br>
large step upwards.  It appeared to support more complex memes (art,
<br>
more complex tools), to suddenly allow the transmission of memes from
<br>
individual to individual with higher accuracy (many tools built to
<br>
same design), and to provide greater protection of the tribe against
<br>
external threats (increased life expectancy).
<br>
<p>2) Prior to this 40-50k point, Europe and Asia were peopled by
<br>
Neanderthals.  
<br>
<p>- Neanderthals were physically much tougher than cro-magnon men (our
<br>
ancestors).  Neanderthal brains were as large as cro-magnon brains.
<br>
So prima facia, we'd expect Neanderthals to compete with and perhaps
<br>
out-compete Cro-Magnons. 
<br>
<p>- However, within a very short timespan after the first evidence of
<br>
cro-magnon man in Africa, they had spread to the farthest corners of
<br>
Europe and Asia.  What's more, while cro-magnon man flourished,
<br>
Neanderthals /went extinct/.  And, while there is still a bit of
<br>
controversy over this, the consensus among both geneticists and
<br>
anthropologists is the Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals did not cross
<br>
breed.
<br>
<p>3) Relevant to the cross-breeding issue is this observation: In modern
<br>
humans, when a technologically superior culture has come in contact
<br>
with a technologically inferior culture a wide variety of outcomes
<br>
ensue.  In some cases the tech inferior population is wiped out.  More
<br>
frequently, the tech inferior culture assimilates the technology of
<br>
the tech superior culture.  For example, agriculture was developed
<br>
independently about half a dozen times in human history, but spread to
<br>
a few thousand different cultures.
<br>
<p>However, /this never happened between Cro-Magnons and Neanderthals!/
<br>
Neanderthals never adopted the superior technology of cro-magnon man.
<br>
This suggests that they were in some way unable.  The specific
<br>
suggestion here is that they lacked the power of speech necessary for
<br>
the effective transmission of these technological memes.
<br>
<p>4) From the genetic side, we have the emergence of the FOXP2 gene.
<br>
Mutations in FOXP2 in humans result in a variety of severe speech
<br>
deficits.  Virtually all mammals, including other primates, share an
<br>
earlier, non-human version of FOXP2 which is not compatible with
<br>
spoken language.  The modern version that we humans have arose fairly
<br>
recently.  Population genetic studies put the cap on when this arose
<br>
at about 200,000 years.  This doesn't prove the 40,000 number, but
<br>
puts something of an upper bound on how long ago human speech could
<br>
have arisen.  Specifically, it suggests that modern language abilities
<br>
were not around at the dawn of homo sapiens half a million years ago.
<br>
<p><p>Put this all together and you don't have an ironclad case, but it's
<br>
rather suggestive that /something/ important in human symbolic
<br>
thinking and meme-processing and meme-communicating ability happened
<br>
around 40k - 50k years ago.  Language is a pretty good fit for that
<br>
something.
<br>
<p>cheers,
<br>
