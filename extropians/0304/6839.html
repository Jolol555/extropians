<p>
I am intrigued with the idea that building new proteins is better than
<br>
reusing old proteins.  A vegetarian diet may do this more than a meat diet,
<br>
and I have previously researched this issue to see if this was a good thing
<br>
or a bad thing.  My conclusion is that it was a good thing.  But I had not
<br>
considered the idea that new proteins may have less defects than old
<br>
proteins.  This sounds even better than what I had concluded.
<br>
<p>Here is a brief explanation of the difference between animal proteins and
<br>
veggie proteins.  Animal proteins are &quot;complete&quot; proteins in that they are
<br>
constructed of aminos preformed into the exact ratios required to make
<br>
flesh.  Therefore it is perfect for human consumption and direct
<br>
utilization.  However, veggie proteins are &quot;incomplete&quot; proteins.  They do
<br>
not contain all the amino acids in animal flesh, but contain subsets of the
<br>
&quot;essential&quot; aminos.  The &quot;essential&quot; aminos are those that cannot be created
<br>
in the body, but must be eaten.  Vegetarians then have to create other
<br>
&quot;non-essential&quot; aminos out of the &quot;essential&quot; ones.  Then, vegetarians have
<br>
to assemble the aminos to create new proteins to be utilized in the body.
<br>
This is the big difference between vegetarian protein sources and animal
<br>
protein sources.
<br>
<p>I had a lot of worry that having to build all my own proteins from scratch
<br>
would be harder on my body.  Older nutritional knowledge thought that
<br>
vegetarians had to combine protein foods to make complete proteins in each
<br>
meal.  Later research showed that aminos last many days in the body so that
<br>
food combining is not necessary.  I also decided that it seemed better to
<br>
build new proteins as they were needed instead of eating excess protein and
<br>
storing it beyond what was actually required.  This idea of new proteins
<br>
being less damaged than older, reused proteins may be an added benefit for
<br>
me.  It adds more support to my personal choice to eat essential aminos over
<br>
a lot of non-essential aminos or pre-formed complete proteins.
