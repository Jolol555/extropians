<p><em>&gt; So you do see a reason to avoid some meats as unhealthy. 
</em><br>
<p>I do not avoid meats, nor do I recommend that others do so. I am merely very
<br>
selective about them because of the way modern farmers raise their cattle.
<br>
And I do sometimes order natural wild game or range-fed meats.
<br>
<p>Again, I mentioned the availability of natural meats to Greg only in order
<br>
to help him clarify his position regarding animal foods. As it turns out, he
<br>
is a vegetarian largely because he believes he has a moral obligation to be
<br>
kind to animals.
<br>
<p>You on the other hand argue that you don't like farm-fed meats but you do
<br>
not seem to be opposed to the notion of eating natural meats. Or are you? If
<br>
you are open to eating natural meats then I would say you are not actually a
<br>
vegetarian in any ideological sense. 
<br>
<p>As for tofu, it does not contain many of the substances found in meats and
<br>
it contains many other substances not found in meats. We evolved on meats,
<br>
not soy, and I don't try to second-guess nature. I also have reservations
<br>
about soy in terms of nutrition science. It contains, among other things,
<br>
phytates which disturb the digestion process by binding to minerals.
<br>
Phytates are not removed during the process of making tofu (though some
<br>
other forms of processed soy do not contain them). Some researchers believe
<br>
phytates are &quot;anti-nutrients,&quot; while others disagree. I know only this much:
<br>
we did not evolve on a diet rich in phytates as found in non-paleolithic
<br>
foods like soy.
