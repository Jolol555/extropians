<a href="mailto:hagbard@ix.netcom.com?Subject=Re:%20GOV:%20US%20Reputation%20(RE:%20Arab%20World%20Stunned%20by%20Baghdad's%20Fall)">hagbard@ix.netcom.com</a> writes: In my mind, the claim that this administration 
<br>
has opened a frightening new chapter in US foreign policy is a claim that may 
<br>
be overstated.  'Pre-emption' is nothing more than lawyer's sleight of hand. 
<br>
It's a discursive trick used to justify an already agreed-upon course of 
<br>
action post-hoc. It is a claim to have predicted the future with enough 
<br>
certainty to justify intervention, and the prediction is not replicable by 
<br>
anyone else because threat model is classified or based on classfied 
<br>
intelligence. Justifying a pre-emptive strike without a smoking gun requires 
<br>
your audience to believe in your voodoo.
<br>
<p>Keith,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe you are being just a little bit academic.  The situation is 
<br>
anything but academic.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our President was in a real world situation.  He might or might not 
<br>
(if I listen to the naysayers) have had classified intelligence to justify 
<br>
his position.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand there is no question in my mind based on public 
<br>
information that had accumulated for literally years that Sadaam represented 
<br>
a threat to this country and that he was financing, training and equiping 
<br>
people that would attack us if he didn't do so himself.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When the United Nations showed itself incapable of defending the world 
<br>
against Sadaam then it was right and proper for our country to take him out.
<br>
Ron h.
