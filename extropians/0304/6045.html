Good post, Hal. 
<br>
<p>I guess the real fear should rather be about who owns the operating
<br>
system rather than the TC system. The one who owns the OS owns the
<br>
contents (&quot;Yes, Microsoft is allowed to delete you - didn't you read the
<br>
EULA before clicking?&quot;). 
<br>
<p>The problem with the TC infrastructure is lock-in and lock-out
<br>
situations. If software relies on TC, it might be unable to interoperate
<br>
or transfer to systems with other TC systems or newer TCs - imagine what
<br>
happens when TC V1.0 (4096 bit keys) is shown to be insecure and it is
<br>
time to migrate to TC V2.0 (16384 bit keys), and people can't transfer
<br>
their files because the software won't let them move to the safer (but
<br>
from the software's point of view, untrustworthy) system. This suggests
<br>
that backwards compatibility will be extremely important, and that may
<br>
lead to lock in effects too (&quot;Yes children, once upon a time there were
<br>
two standards of a little chip.  And that is why the galaxy now is
<br>
divided into the Solarian and the Macrostar empires and we can't
<br>
communicate with each other&quot;). 
<br>
<p>The second problem is that untrusted software will have a disadvantage
<br>
within formal institutions such as companies, governments etc against
<br>
trusted software. It makes a lot of sense to only trust TC systems and
<br>
handle outside systems much more carefully or not at all. But it is
<br>
within the untrusted environment the creative commons lie, it is here
<br>
where much of the bottom up ideas emerge. One can of course take the
<br>
best of this and turn them into trusted systems (I guess a TC linux is
<br>
quite doable, it is just that any changes in the code will not be
<br>
trusted, even if they are entirely allowable), but that will require a
<br>
costly (in time, effort, trust building) code review that will act both
<br>
as a limiting threshold and cause it to leave the creative common. 
<br>
<p>To me, these problems doesn't seem insurmountable. They are messy
<br>
legal-engineering-social-philosophical problems, but they can likely be
<br>
solved. Or rather, there are probably sufficiently good solutions that
<br>
we can live with them. The great risk right now is that we get trapped
<br>
into a premature brittle solution that is suboptimal or has a strong
<br>
lock in factor. We need limited prototypes of this to play with and find
<br>
what really can work, not wholesale standards enforced by law or
<br>
monopolies.
