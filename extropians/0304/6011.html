In a message dated 4/8/2003 6:58:38 PM Central Standard Time, 
<br>
<a href="mailto:lcorbin@tsoft.com?Subject=Re:%20(ESS)">lcorbin@tsoft.com</a> quotes Ron h: I think determining which is the best ESS is 
<br>
what we need to be discussing. However, I do want to emphasize that I am 
<br>
looking at an evolutionary society not a static one.  The problem with the 
<br>
southern middle class society was  that in many ways it was too static.
<br>
Then Lee replied: Why would you say so?  Was (or is) it likely to be too 
<br>
unaccepting of new ideas, have too little emphasis on education, or what?
<br>
<p>Lee,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The south IMHO spent too much time on spilt milk and maintaining 
<br>
supremacy over the black race.  I am in an odd position in that I am a 
<br>
southerner whose immediate ancestors of that time fought for Mr. Lincoln.  
<br>
Never the less that is my observation.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I find myself welcoming the possibility of discussing the ideas of 
<br>
Gatto but unwilling to try to immediately prescribe what a Gatto like society 
<br>
would be like.  Even a thorough statement on my part would tend to draw 
<br>
battle lines -- lines that I don't intend.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am much taken by Gatto's report on the dialectic method of the 
<br>
Puritans.  They did not build their society based on experts opinions or on 
<br>
the dictates of the powerful.  There is no doubt in my mind that through the 
<br>
dialectic they made some horrible mistakes.  But equally they corrected those 
<br>
errors (IMO) and became very progressive.  
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As our future society will be determined through trial and error 
<br>
perhaps a good way to start would be in a discussion of that particular 
<br>
dialectic method?
<br>
Ron h.
<br>
<p>BTW, sorry to take so long to answer but you slapped a big shot into my end 
<br>
of the court -- that is good.  &lt;G&gt;
