</em><br>
<p>Ahhh, the old argument returns.  I have reduced this debate thusly in my own
<br>
mind:
<br>
<p>Some people want to avoid being destroyed.  Destructive copying still
<br>
results the destruction they wish to avoid.  They do not believe that a
<br>
duplicate copy somewhere else mitigates their death.  Their death is exactly
<br>
the same whether there is a copy or not.
<br>
<p>Other people want to preserve some attributes of themselves.  Destructive
<br>
copying makes sure that those attributes exist somewhere else when the
<br>
original dies.  Therefore their desired attributes are preserved and avoids
<br>
the destruction.  The surviving attributes are exactly the same whether
<br>
there is a copy or not.
<br>
<p>&quot;What is the difference?&quot;  Semantics, I think.  Each side of the debate has
<br>
different goals for what they are trying to achieve.  They all call their
<br>
various goals with the same label of &quot;survival&quot;, which confuses us into
<br>
assuming that there is one answer as to whether it is achieved or not in any
<br>
hypothetical operation.  But actually, I think each person has different
<br>
goals.  Therefore the real answer is that different operations achieve
<br>
different forms of &quot;survival&quot; that are acceptable to different people for
<br>
different goals.
<br>
<p>Both sides have two results which they compare as exactly identical and for
<br>
which the other side can't explain &quot;the difference&quot; to convince them to
<br>
change their mind.  The pro-destructive-copy people compare the before and
<br>
after copies as being identical and can't see any difference to make them
<br>
change their mind.  The anti-destructive-people compare the dead person in
<br>
the copy scenario with the dead person in the non-copy scenario, and can't
<br>
see any difference to make them change their mind.  Both are correct in
<br>
their viewpoint for their own goals, and no argument for a different
<br>
procedure that doesn't meet their goals will change their mind.  Only
<br>
changing their criteria goals will convince anybody to change their mind.
