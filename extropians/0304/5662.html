<br>
<p><em>&gt;      Here I would challenge your assertion that our current actions 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have nothing to do with liberation beyond rhetoric. Iraq is currently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruled by a brutal, despotic regime (a point I hope all of us on this 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; list might agree).
</em><br>
<p>To which Samantha responded:
<br>
<p>&quot;That we agree on this does not mean that liberation of the Iraqi 
<br>
people is the primary motivation for our action or even a very 
<br>
significant one.&quot;
<br>
<p>As I subsequently pointed out, I am under no illusion that it is our primary 
<br>
motivation for moving against Saddam Hussein. It need not be. Our primary 
<br>
motivation in defending Syngman Rhee's regime in Korea was not the liberation 
<br>
of the South Korean people. If the end result is still the liberation of the 
<br>
Iraqi people from Hussein, that is something to be celebrated.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;Though our actions are being taken primarily out of
<br>
<em>&gt; our own self-interest, the Iraqi people will benefit from the removal of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that barbaric thug Hussein. As I have said many times, it would be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; foolish for anyone to suggest that just because our actions are not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; based on altruism, that the end results which follow them would then be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; devoid of merit. Unless of course you believe that the removal of Saddam 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Hussein and his regime would not somehow positively impact the lives of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the Iraqi people. If that is indeed the case, then I would respectfully 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ask that you elaborate on why you feel that removing that butcher would 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; not directly benefit in the long term that beleagured people.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;At this point I see no way of being sure that the proposed 23 
<br>
ministries headed by Americans with Iraqis as only advisors will 
<br>
appear to the Iraqi people or to the world as a net gain any 
<br>
time soon.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would respectfully suggest that the outlook of post-Hussein Iraq is still 
<br>
to be determined. Despite the heated rhetoric on all sides (yes, including 
<br>
our government), I do not believe we will proceed in helping to administer 
<br>
that nation without there being a significant role for the United Nations. I 
<br>
must take issue with your contention that even a US led Iraq as compared to 
<br>
the continued rule of Saddam Hussein would not be &quot;a net gain&quot; to the Iraqis 
<br>
or the world. As I have stressed many times, the Soviet Union is gone, and 
<br>
the United States is now in a position to fully embrace the growth of 
<br>
democracy throughout the world, rather than having to settle for &quot;the 
<br>
(significantly) lesser of two evils&quot; in many cases. Whoever is chosen to lead 
<br>
Iraq by the United States and the coalition will be far better for Iraq than 
<br>
Saddam Hussein, just as in the cases of Hamid Karzai in Afghanistan and 
<br>
Shigeru Yoshida in Japan.   
<br>
<p><p>&quot;There is likely to be a lot of strife and violence 
<br>
in imposing and maintaining this occupation.&quot;
<br>
<p>This remains to be seen and is not a given, especially in the sense that the 
<br>
form of occupation and governance has not yet been determined. However there 
<br>
is certain to be a lessening of arbitrary torture and mass killings within 
<br>
Iraq.
<br>
<p>&quot;Iraqis sometimes say that any other than a very strong and domineering 
<br>
leader 
<br>
would not work in Iraq.  I hope they are wrong.&quot;
<br>
<p>The Russians have always said this about their country, as have many Chinese. 
<br>
I would suggest it was a sentiment many English shared in the Middle Ages and 
<br>
after. However, old stereotypes and superstitions are not valid 
<br>
justifications for the continued allowance of brutal despotism.
<br>
<p>&quot;A large part of the beleaguring of the people is, or is 
<br>
perceived as, the doings of ourselves and the British 
<br>
especially, and the UN more generally.  There is some level of 
<br>
veracity to this view.  The people would be most un-beleagured 
<br>
by getting the control of their country back without sanctions 
<br>
and continuous bombardment and interference.  I don't know at 
<br>
this point how far we are from that.  Noone does.&quot;
<br>
<p>That is obviously a question that will remain forever unanswered. I am 
<br>
comfortable with that, however, given the brutality with which Hussein put 
<br>
down the uprisings in 1991. The Iraqis will be given the chance for a better 
<br>
life and the opportunity to choose their own destiny, options that never 
<br>
would have come under the Husseins. 
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Not by itself, no, it is not. But when one's argument is based in large 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; part, as some have done, on unending criticism of the United States, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the record of the US needs to be fully analyzed and understood in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; historical perspective to refute such an argument.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;The wrongs of the US that are directly pertinent to the current 
<br>
situation are still directly pertinent no matter how many rights 
<br>
the US has also accomplished.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then I would simply ask that you elaborate on what US &quot;wrongs&quot; you feel are 
<br>
directly pertinent to this situation, so that this point might be properly 
<br>
discussed or debated.
<br>
<p><p>&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I would respectfully disagree. Perhaps this is not an apt description of 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your point of view, nor was I referring to you specifically in that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; paragraph, but I have had debates on this forum where people opposed to 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this action have acknowledged they would like to see the United States 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;humbled&quot; due to their preeminent position in the world.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;I would like to see the US &quot;humbled&quot; from the unabashed 
<br>
arrogance of presuming the right to attack any country at any 
<br>
time, even preemptively, if they feel at all threatened.&quot;
<br>
<p>Then it is your assertion that the United States must wait to be attacked, as 
<br>
it was on September 11th, before dealing with potential threats and hostile 
<br>
entities? I believe you and I would agree that this is the crux of the matter 
<br>
and our debate. Simply put, many Americans, not least of which the current 
<br>
administration, are prepared to play such a deadly waiting game. At the risk 
<br>
of expanding this into a truly long and involved conversation, I would be 
<br>
curious to know if you believe that this war against Hussein's regime will 
<br>
lead to terrorist attacks. I would then be curious to know if you believe 
<br>
there would have been future terrorist attacks against the United States had 
<br>
there been no war in Iraq.
<br>
<p>If the answer to either question is yes, then what do you propose the United 
<br>
States do regarding terrorists in the Middle East and abroad if removing 
<br>
unstable terrorist supporting regimes such as Hussein and the Taliban is not 
<br>
the answer? Surely the key is enabling the peoples of that region to achieve 
<br>
a better life, where prosperity is the chief concern, not Zionist 
<br>
conspiracies. 
<br>
<p>&quot;I don't say *we* here because this is no part of this American's 
<br>
understanding of what this country is supposed to be about.  I 
<br>
would like us &quot;humbled&quot; from the notion that we should and must 
<br>
insure that no other country or group of countries ever becomes 
<br>
as economically, politically and/or militarily as strong as we.&quot;
<br>
<p>How does one accomplish such a thing that you envision without the use of 
<br>
coercion or force? Were it not the United States in a position of primacy, 
<br>
then another country would simply fill the vacuum with potentially more 
<br>
disastrous consequences for the world.
<br>
<p>&quot;This also is in my mind an exceedingly un-American way of 
<br>
conducting international affairs.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would have to be privy to your definition of an &quot;American way&quot; of 
<br>
conducting international affairs to comment.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This, I would respectfully argue, is an oversimplification on your part. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; The United States is not &quot;remolding the world&quot; in our image, or &quot;to our 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; liking&quot; or we would be installing democracies in countries currently 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; ruled by totalitarian thugs that have not sought weapons of mass 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction like Laos, Vietnam, and sadly more African nations then I 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would care to mention. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Give us time.  There are two ways of domination.  One is by 
<br>
rearranging governments wholesale to our liking or control.  The 
<br>
other is by undercutting governments so that they cannot gainsay 
<br>
us too effectively.&quot;
<br>
<p>Again, I must offer, as I did with Damien Sullivan, that this is merely 
<br>
conjecture on your part against an administration that I think it fair to say 
<br>
you have held in low esteem since most likely January 20, 2001.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The United States is acting in its defensive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; self-interests against a regime that has actively sought weapons of mass 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction, in the recent past invaded its neighbor, and shown a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; decidedly anti-U.S. fervor. 
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Hell, if I was in a country that had endured what Iraq had 
<br>
endured I would have anti-US fervor.  I don't see how we can get 
<br>
anywhere at all without admitting that a lot of Mid-East nations 
<br>
have considerable reason to distrust and even hate us. Without 
<br>
seeing that we are acting from fantasy land.&quot;
<br>
<p>By the same token I would suggest that if the peoples of the Middle East 
<br>
don't admit to themselves that they are as much to blame, if not more so, for 
<br>
their own problems as the Americans and Israelis, they will continue to live 
<br>
in an impoverished and cruel fantasy land.
<br>
<p><em>&gt;If Saddam Hussein truly possessed no threat 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to anyone, then why would a body with as many divergent interests such 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; as the UN have supported any resolutions on disarmament, let alone see 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the need to ferry weapons inspectors in and out of the country for more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; than a decade?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>&quot;Because it was part of Iraqi War 1 agreements that he disarm and 
<br>
because the case was imho over-inflated of the danger he 
<br>
represented.  Any attempt to reevaluate the situation over the 
<br>
years was vetoed principally by us. We largely control the 
<br>
Security Council.  As much disagreement as recently was the case 
<br>
is the exception.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would respectfully suggest that you give United States historical influence 
<br>
in the United Nations far too much credit. To suggest we &quot;control&quot; the 
<br>
Security Council is certainly not accurate.
<br>
<p>&quot;Why is there so much disagreement with this 
<br>
invasion if it is crystal clear it is the right thing to do and 
<br>
that Saddam is still, after 12 years of sanctions, a huge 
<br>
military defeat, years of inspections, continuous patrolling and 
<br>
bombardment of the no-fly zones unilaterally imposed by us and 
<br>
the British, a great and present threat?  Why on earth would any 
<br>
sane person believe he is much of a threat after all that?  I 
<br>
really don't understand it.&quot;
<br>
<p>I do not think it helpful that you imply that those who come to the 
<br>
conclusion that Saddam Hussein and his regime are a threat are &quot;insane&quot;. 
<br>
People could just as easily question your sanity for believing diplomatic 
<br>
solutions work with such tyrants as Hitler, Hussein, and Kim, despite 
<br>
overwhelming historical evidence to the contrary. But, regardless of whether 
<br>
or not you feel it justified, Hussein is going to be out of power. To rehash 
<br>
arguments such as the merits of this intervention are ultimately 
<br>
unproductive. Every voice, including those who were opposed to it, should be 
<br>
focused on demanding and delivering upon the best possible future 
<br>
administration of Iraq. 
<br>
<p><p>&quot;It is not our job or the UN's job to insure every country has 
<br>
what we or the majority might consider a reasonable leader.&quot;
<br>
<p>As far as I know, the UN has never accomplished this. The United States 
<br>
government, on the other hand, has had to bear this responsibility on many 
<br>
occasions. But you are correct, it is not within the US's abilities or 
<br>
interests to make sure that every country has a reasonable leader. It is 
<br>
their responsibility to deal with those they consider a threat, however.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; This is not 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; surprising, given their failure to act while genocide occured in 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Cambodia, Rwanda and scores of other locales.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;And their failure to act on our illegal actions in Nicaragua or 
<br>
to act to stop Israeli actions against Palestine or even to send 
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;inspectors to see for themselves the extent of the latter 
<br>
problem.&quot;
<br>
<p>I would ask that you explain under what jurisdiction the US actions in 
<br>
Nicaragua were illegal. I would also offer that I haven't seen the UN 
<br>
condemning that thug Arafat, either.
<br>
<p>&quot;I certainly won't argue the UN is very effective. 
<br>
However, that it isn't does not mean we can and should do 
<br>
whatever we wish or that what we are doing in this case is 
<br>
justified.&quot;
<br>
<p>But ultimately whether or not you feel it is justified, Saddam Hussein is 
<br>
going to be removed sooner rather than later. That at least, you should 
<br>
celebrate.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&quot;Actually, I think we could support internal movements for change 
<br>
and not come in until/unless asked by significant representatives of the 
<br>
Iraqi people and only then if it was also in our interest.&quot;
<br>
<p>I do concede that I wish there was more of a public face from the Iraqi 
<br>
National Congress or some other internal group. However, I don't follow the 
<br>
circumstance in which you believe Saddam Hussein would permit &quot;significant 
<br>
representatives of the Iraqi people&quot; to protest his regime and ask us to 
<br>
forcibly remove him. But ultimately, such thoughts are fanciful and 
<br>
unproductive. Hussein is finished, and the debate should turn toward the best 
<br>
way to organize the new Iraqi regime.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In more than 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one thread (such as one on the Shah of Iran), in discussions with me, 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; you have consistently criticized the US's support of authoritarian 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regimes in the past. I have countered that the US did not have a choice 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; between democracy and authoritarianism, it had choices between 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; authoritarianism and worse.
</em><br>
<p>&quot;This is not strictly true but that is another subject.&quot;
<br>
<p>And I would someday love to debate you on the merits of that position….:)
<br>
<p>&nbsp;&quot;I criticize us for acting extra-legally around the world, 
<br>
frankly as terrorists, to change regimes to our liking.  We have 
<br>
used industrial espionage, economic sabotage, mass incitement to 
<br>
riot, assasinations and so on for these purposes.  Civilized 
<br>
people must condemn this.  I am amazed when I see what I presume 
<br>
are civilized people excuse such.&quot;
<br>
<p>Such mass indictments do not help the debate unless you provide specific 
<br>
examples that you base such accusations upon.
<br>
