Damien Broderick &lt;<a href="mailto:damienb@unimelb.edu.au?Subject=Re:%20Questions%20to%20ask%20a%20god%20or%20a%20time%20traveller/ET%20(was:%20RE:%20If%20Magick%20Exists)">damienb@unimelb.edu.au</a>&gt; asked:
<br>
<em>&gt;&gt;&gt;
</em><br>
What questions would people here pose to a deity claimant (or surrogate)? 
<br>
&lt;&lt;&lt;
<br>
<p>No questions should be necessary!  The deity (or surrogate) or advanced alien, 
<br>
or visitor from the future (or choose your favorite supper being) should come 
<br>
in with their rescue ships, sirens a blazing, as fast as they can, heading 
<br>
mostly to the hospitals and anywhere else down here where people are still 
<br>
suffering and dieing and help us in our efforts to save them and relieve their 
<br>
misery.
<br>
<p>If we do discover such a being that claims to be some kind of supper being that 
<br>
is not successfully involved in such activity as fast as is possible then 
<br>
perhaps one question would be appropriate: &quot;Why?&quot;
<br>
<p>There are lots of religions and beliefs that contain many types of various 
<br>
supper beings.  All of them have various justifications for why their &quot;God&quot; is 
<br>
not giving us more of a hand at relieving some of this misery.  To religious 
<br>
people this is known as &quot;The problem of evil&quot;  They call these 
<br>
justifications &quot;theodicies&quot; and they are all irrational BS.  Everything from 
<br>
some kind of &quot;prime directive&quot; to &quot;We’ve got to be free to choose&quot; all this 
<br>
misery...
<br>
<p>Are you listening all you Gods and ETs out there?  Screw your prime directives 
<br>
and any other justification you think you have and get down here and give us a 
<br>
hand!
<br>
<p>This is why I think any extropian must also be a hard core atheist and why 
<br>
extropianism isn't compatible with any belief system that includes any &quot;higher 
<br>
power&quot;.  Misery and supper beings are mutually exclusive.  One cannot exist 
<br>
with the other.  If there is already a supper being out there hiding from us 
<br>
while there is still misery down here – then we are eternally screwed – for 
<br>
even if we become as powerful as that being, like that being, and for the same 
<br>
reason, we will not be able to eliminate all known misery.
<br>
<p>If some alleged God came up with some answer to this &quot;why?&quot; question that truly 
<br>
made rational sense for why misery is tolerated by powerful beings – now that 
<br>
would be powerful evidence of their true Godliness.  We would still be screwed –
<br>
&nbsp;but it would be impressive.
<br>
