<p>No? If a substance causes cancer in humans then how can you say humans are
<br>
adapted to it? 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Evidence as presented at the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; meat and otherwise using fire right when they were first evolving
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Yes but our genetic past stretches back several million years (actually
<br>
billions of years, though most prefer to draw the line at early hominids).
<br>
Fire-cooking is relatively recent on that time-scale, though I will agree
<br>
that we are probably *almost* adapted to it. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; <a href="http://www.applesforhealth.com/WomensHealth/redmeacolc4.html">http://www.applesforhealth.com/WomensHealth/redmeacolc4.html</a>
</em><br>
<p>I don't see any problem with the conclusions in that article: 
<br>
<p>&quot;As to why the Western-style of diet might increase colon cancer risk, Fung
<br>
said it might be a combination of factors. Processed meats and red meat
<br>
cooked at high temperatures contain chemicals that can increase cancer
<br>
risk,...&quot;
<br>
<p>This is exactly my point. &quot;Processed meats and red meat cooked at high
<br>
temperatures contain chemicals that increase cancer risk.&quot; 
<br>
<p>I will agree with you however that the subject of fire-cooking is still very
<br>
much open to debate, even among serious paleodieters. This is due mainly to
<br>
fact that we can't be quite sure when fire-cooking first appeared. Some say
<br>
it happened as recently as 50,000 years ago, while others such as those you
<br>
quote think it happened more like 125,000 years ago. It is also possible
<br>
that hominids have been eating plenty of the cooked meat left over from
<br>
forest fires for much longer than 125,000 years. The further back we push
<br>
the date, the more acceptable it looks. 
<br>
<p>As for studies which purport to show that HCA's are not carcinogenic in the
<br>
first place, this is a perfect example of the ambiguity and contradictions
<br>
in modern nutritional science. Some say HCA's are carcinogenic, some say
<br>
otherwise. Paleodiet theory attempts to settle the debate with archeology
<br>
and evolution science rather than nutritional science.
