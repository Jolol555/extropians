</em><br>
<p>I have a different idea, but it is more radical than this and in practice
<br>
has no chance of success.
<br>
<p>Lee Crocker makes a good point that copyright laws, as well as the even
<br>
more invasive TCPA, undercut the morality of even voluntary digital
<br>
rights management (DRM) schemes.  What we are likely to end up with is
<br>
the worst of both worlds - DRM that doesn't necessarily protect fair use,
<br>
and which never expires, backed up by copyright and TCPA that use laws
<br>
to prevent people from breaking even technologically weak DRM.
<br>
<p>One approach is to try to do as Rafal suggests, which is to try to bring
<br>
the balanced approach in the current copyright law over to the DRM world.
<br>
Two problems I see with this: first, politically the stakes are so high
<br>
that it is going to be difficult to come up with an acceptable compromise.
<br>
We see this already in the competing bills in the U.S. Congress, some to
<br>
tighten TCPA and some to loosen it.  What you end up with is stalemate,
<br>
more often than not.
<br>
<p>And second, my philosophy is that ultimately these issues should be
<br>
decided by physics and not law.  Either the universe is such that secrets
<br>
can be protected, or it is not.  I.e. either unbreakable cryptography
<br>
exists or it doesn't; tamper-proof containers exist or not; people
<br>
can protect their privacy or they can't; etc.  These kinds of issues
<br>
will ultimately determine what is technologically possible as far as
<br>
information management.  I think we would do best to try to answer such
<br>
questions and make our laws be in accordance with them.  Otherwise there
<br>
will be constant cheating.  So I would prefer a relatively unregulated,
<br>
laissez-faire approach and let people on all sides throw their best
<br>
technical efforts at the question.
<br>
<p>This is why I have worked on projects such as Freenet and anonymous
<br>
remailers while at the same time, as readers here have seen, supporting
<br>
the idea of rights management software.  In debate or in court, we want
<br>
both sides to promote their case as vigorously as possible, in order to
<br>
reach the truth.  I want to see the same thing in the marketplace - again,
<br>
always under the provision that people are participating voluntarily.
<br>
<p>Which leads me to my &quot;modest proposal&quot;, which is to get rid of copyright
<br>
laws, TCPA etc., and replace them with unrestricted, unfettered DRM.
<br>
Rather than doing as Rafal suggests and forcing DRM to honor fair use,
<br>
we leave it up to the producers and consumers of the DRM content to
<br>
negotiate the terms under which it will be licensed.  And we leave it
<br>
up to the technologists to explore the envelope as far as what kinds of
<br>
protections are really possible.
<br>
<p>Today, the main camps are pushing for the two extremes.
<br>
The content companies want to tighten copyright laws, add DMCA,
<br>
the so-called &quot;super-DMCA&quot; laws being passed state by state (see
<br>
<a href="http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/">http://www.freedom-to-tinker.com/</a>), laws to close the &quot;analog hole&quot;
<br>
(keep you from photographing your computer screen!) like the Hollings bill
<br>
(CBDTPA), etc.  Plus they are pushing for DRM, encouraging Microsoft to
<br>
do Palladium; and many of these laws are designed to add teeth to DRM.
<br>
<p>At the other extreme are the online civil liberties groups, who want to
<br>
limit copyright and who oppose DRM, TCPA, Palladium, etc.  They encourage
<br>
open source, they emphasize the importance of incremental development of
<br>
ideas which requires freedom to access and modify existing information.
<br>
They tried to strike down copyright extensions with the Eldred lawsuit,
<br>
but that failed.  Meanwhile they fight against the Hollings bill and
<br>
promote other laws to limit the DMCA.
<br>
<p>Both of these camps would oppose my proposal; I suspect it is because each
<br>
side is afraid that they would lose the technology battle.  They would
<br>
rather fight in the courts, because then they feel that they will sink
<br>
or swim by their own efforts.  Ultimately the technology wars will be
<br>
won or lost depending on Nature, not on man, and I think this gives
<br>
people a feeling of insecurity.  They'd rather be at the controls of
<br>
the crashing airplane than sitting in the back.
<br>
<p>In practice I think Rafal's compromise has a much better chance of
<br>
being accepted than mine.  Limit and restrict DRM so that it precisely
<br>
mimics the provisions of copyright law.  Make sure it expires when the
<br>
copyright does; make sure people can make N copies for personal use,
<br>
that they can time-shift and perform whatever other specific activities
<br>
the courts and legislatures decide are appropriate.  Decide in the
<br>
courts whether professors can make copies for students; whether taking
<br>
your music with you in an iPod is personal use, and what if you hook
<br>
up speakers so that other people can hear it, etc., etc.  All this
<br>
will be hashed out in ever-more-complex legislation which gets turned
<br>
into mandatory policy that all DRM systems must observe.  And meanwhile
<br>
there are still people out there hacking their systems and doing their
<br>
best to bypass the restrictions.  I don't find this very attractive,
<br>
but it is a plausible outcome based on the path we are on today.
