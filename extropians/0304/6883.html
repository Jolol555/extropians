<em>&gt; Guerilla warfare was, to the British, a new

</em><br>
<p>Also the idea of using maneuver for its own sake, to exhaust enemy
<br>
supply lines and troop morale, and not just as a means to contact the
<br>
enemy. Sun Tsu's &quot;The Art of War&quot; was unknown by the British at that
<br>
point, and the precepts he advised were certainly a 'new' technology.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; This does not all follow.  Or did the Soviets not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; put something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; in orbit first and field and extraordinary army of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; excellent 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; scientiests and engineers in the cold war?  Did they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; or did they 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; not acheive sufficient military technology to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; destroy the world 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; just as we did?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; But you'll note they were nice to their scientists as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; well.  Very nice.  Communism was an inefficient
</em><br>
<em>&gt; economic model, and there it eventually fell flat, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; post-WWII Soviet Russia was a far cry better than the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; regimes we have put down over the past decade.
</em><br>
<p>The communists also did not invent anything new in the space program.
<br>
They relied entirely on captured Nazi technology which itself was
<br>
entirely reliant on American technology (Goddard's patents) which were
<br>
never exploited here, mostly due to economic reasons but also because
<br>
military types did not appreciate technology as a weapon.
<br>
<p>WWII never displayed a significant disparity in technological prowess.
<br>
Every axis technological advance was only months or at best a few years
<br>
ahead of allied advances, and vice versa.
<br>
<p>The early advantage of the Nazis, though, taught the allies the lesson
<br>
about technology as a weapon. We have not forgotten it either. Since
<br>
that lesson has been learned, the US has specifically advanced itself
<br>
10-30 years ahead of every other military organization on the planet.
<br>
Some countries have a *few* weapons systems that are comparable,
<br>
usually due to US exported technology, but none has been able to attain
<br>
such across the board technological comparability/superiority in every
<br>
area. The closest are the europeans, and they are still a decade behind
<br>
today in most weapons systems. Every other country now depends on US
<br>
technology to boost their military capabilities. 
<br>
<p>Even more important, there is no other country with as advanced a
<br>
military industry. A military force is only a potent as the industry
<br>
which supports it.
