If Cricthton wrote about everything working out just chummy, he would never 
<br>
get published. If Peter Benchley had written about the number and 
<br>
characteristics of shark attacks, Jaws would have been published as a vanity 
<br>
press release. Drama is usually a way of understanding the potential of a 
<br>
problem, and then having the author use his imagination to thrill people by 
<br>
it. This is akin to roller coaster affcianado's screaming through the thrill 
<br>
ride. Dangerous, but almost completely safe, assuming one hasn't eaten 
<br>
beforehand. There have been a few thrillers about computers going haywire and 
<br>
staring nuclear wars, or the hideous and terrifying dangers of the internet. 
<br>
But for the vast majority of us critters, things are a bit of ok. Drama is 
<br>
used for peddling novels, and promoting movies. If the X-Men, and company, 
<br>
were liked and accepted, there would be no X-Men 2, no Terminator 3, No Matr
<br>
ix Reloaded.

&lt;&lt;Seems like such a formula would be easy to spin in the other direction.
<br>
Luddites warning of technological risks but secretly involved in nasty plots
<br>
for their own greedy purposes.  Technologies hero obviously smart but
<br>
not listened to.  Just in time some disaster is averted by the technology
<br>
heroes using the feared technology.  Luddites are incidentally killed due
<br>
to their own stupidity (or grudgingly accept new technology).  Seems like

I have seen a few movies like this.  But someone might do well by
<br>
specifically copying Chrichton's style.
<br>
<p>I like some of the Luddite ideas.  They provide a balance to our enthusiasm.
<br>
Some people just will not form opinions until they have seen it spun both
<br>
ways.  Perhaps Ludites are necessary for rapid progress.  As for bad
<br>
science (or other factual discrepancies) in fiction, oh well, it happens.
