<p>I'm glad we cleared that up!

<p><em>&gt; Yes, but I disagree with this method of debate.  I think it

</em><br>
<p>But I have offered evidence that supports the paleodiet hypothesis. However,
<br>
regardless of whether you consider it proven, this is how science makes
<br>
progress. It is impossible to perform a meaningful experiment until one
<br>
first has some initial default hypothesis to test against the new competing
<br>
hypothesis. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; There is no &quot;default&quot; position or &quot;burden-of-proof&quot; in science. 
</em><br>
<p>I disagree completely. There is always a default position and the burden of
<br>
proof is always on those who contest it to show with statistical certainty
<br>
(typically defined as 95% confidence) that the default hypothesis is
<br>
incorrect. For example it was the default at one time to believe that the
<br>
earth is flat. One might say this hypothesis was never first proven (though
<br>
it the minds of most of the ancients it seemed perfectly obvious). It was
<br>
however the default null hypothesis. 
<br>
<p>I think what you're really arguing here is that the default null hypothesis
<br>
should be &quot;Harvey Newstrom's personal diet hypothesis&quot; or perhaps &quot;The USDA
<br>
recommended diet hypothesis&quot; or perhaps the &quot;The diet hypothesis as
<br>
exhibited by the eating habits of the typical modern person&quot; or perhaps your
<br>
default hypothesis is the hypothesis of some nutrition scientist you know
<br>
and respect. Certainly a nutrition-minded person like you has *some* general
<br>
diet hypothesis in mind, which in your mind must be disproved before you
<br>
will abandon it.
<br>
<p>We must start from some theoretical foundation, and then build on it by
<br>
comparing it to new competing hypotheses. When a competing hypothesis better
<br>
explains the data than the default null hypothesis, with 95% confidence, it
<br>
wins the prize and becomes the new default working hypothesis against which
<br>
new hypotheses must be tested.
