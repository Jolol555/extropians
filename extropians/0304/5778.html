Harvey writes
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Robert J. Bradbury wrote,
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; I think one problem with these levels is that they seem to presume
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the retention of the current concept of an &quot;individual&quot;.  In a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Jupiter Brain or a Matrioshka Brain one's &quot;individuality&quot; may become
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; so interconnected with the &quot;collective&quot; that it becomes relatively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; difficult or impossible to teleport an individual at all.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; This is where semantics comes in.  We are facing new situations that have
</em><br>
<em>&gt; never occurred before.  Questions about identity, individualism, and the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like beg the question of what these terms mean when copies, backups,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; distributions, and collectives are possible.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, this is certainly true.  I have already found one case where
<br>
probably Harvey and I explicitly agree on actions to be taken, and
<br>
also agree on the desirability of various outcomes, yet are not
<br>
quite using the same terms/words.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Lee continues:
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; I claim that this decision rests with owner of the resources,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; perhaps just the owner of the atoms involved.  For example, if
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; someone came to me and wanted to be teleported to New York, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; insisted that he would permit me to gratify his wish only if I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; also arranged for the destruction of the original, I would
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; reluctantly agree.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; But it *is* a dumb waste, isn't it?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; No, not if its Lee -- one copy is *completely* sufficient.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; :-)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sufficient for what?
</em><br>
<p>Robert was, of course, joking---implying that one of me was adequate
<br>
to cause a lot of trouble in discussions like this ;-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; One copy of Lee is sufficient to continue the situation of having
</em><br>
<em>&gt; one Lee.  But after you have made two copies of Lee, there are more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; possibilities.  Two copies can go in two directions and do more
</em><br>
<em>&gt; things.  Two Lees are better than one.  Now that we have these
</em><br>
<em>&gt; additional possibilities, destroying one Lee is a loss.  Going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; back to one Lee reduces the mobility of Lee, the total brain
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter of Lee, the number of hands Lee can use, the number of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; places Lee can visit concurrently, etc.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but this is true in general (you and I would concur) of
<br>
any particular person.  Yet perhaps counter-examples exist.
<br>
Many people would not favor the existence of multiple Bill
<br>
Gates.  Suppose that it became technologically possible to
<br>
create a duplicate of oneself for ten million dollars, and
<br>
Bill Gates immediately decides to have a thousand duplicates
<br>
of himself created.  He's quite candid about the reasons why:
<br>
&quot;With a thousand more of me, Microsoft profits will go up by
<br>
a huge factor, and then I can afford even more copies of me,
<br>
and so on.&quot;
<br>
<p>Also, many people would object to there being multiple copies
<br>
of known serial killers (even in captivity), or known cruel
<br>
despots.  Surely *one* &quot;Beloved Leader&quot; is enough!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Saying that the one [person] at the end is equivalent to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one [person] at the beginning ignores the additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; [person] in the meantime.  It is like saying I have no
</em><br>
<em>&gt; children now, I can produce children, kill them, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything ends up like it was before.  Some would claim
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that nothing is lost, but once these individuals exist,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is a loss when they cease to exist.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, I agree exactly with what you have written, but perhaps
<br>
not with the values behind it.  Suppose that the choice were
<br>
strictly between
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(A) getting a duplicate, and the two of you working together
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for a year, and then one of you having to painlessly
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;get vaporized
<br>
<p>&nbsp;(B) no duplicate
<br>
<p>I would choose A, because the more run time for me, the better.
<br>
While it's tragic that one of us must die (and I would probably
<br>
futilely attempt bribery or flight when the time came), it's
<br>
still better than the current and ongoing tragedy of a certain
<br>
volume of space not hosting me.  (I just glanced over my shoulder
<br>
at an empty chair in this room, and I momentarily felt again the
<br>
sadness of noticing that I don't have a duplicate there.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The real question seems to boil down to whether anyone would value a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicate copy.  Many people seem to be assuming that after there is one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Lee, another Lee is useless.  I don't share that view.  I would love to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; able to duplicate myself and have an exact copy with my viewpoints and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; history to help me work on my projects.  I would greatly value additional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; copies as useful persons.  A loss of any of these after they were created
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would be a loss.
</em><br>
<p>Totally agree.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I keep insisting that I agree that after a copy operation, both copies are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;me&quot;, and &quot;I&quot; am both copies.  I still don't want any of &quot;me&quot; killed.  I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would no more want a copy destroyed just because it is a duplicate, than I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would give up one of my arms on the theory that I already have another one.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I can do more with more copies.
</em><br>
<p>Absolutely agree.
<br>
<p>Lee
