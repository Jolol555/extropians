<p><p><p><p>Experimental 'Coffee Cocktail' Tested As Way To Limit Stroke Damage
<br>
<p>DALLAS, April 11 – An experimental drug delivering the potency of two cups of 
<br>
strong coffee and a mixed drink has been shown to limit stroke-induced brain 
<br>
damage in animals. Now, this agent has been demonstrated to be safe in a 
<br>
small pilot study of ischemic stroke patients reported in today’s rapid 
<br>
access issue of Stroke: Journal of the American Heart Association.
<br>
<p>This safety study is a crucial prelude to testing the effectiveness of the 
<br>
combination in patients. In previous studies in rats, the size of brain 
<br>
damage was reduced up to 80 percent when a combination of caffeine and 
<br>
ethanol, called caffeinol, was administered within three hours after an 
<br>
artery supplying blood to the brain was blocked (ischemic stroke).
<br>
<p>Those studies “demonstrated that the combination of caffeine and ethanol may 
<br>
reduce the amount of damage after stroke. Neither caffeine or alcohol offered 
<br>
protection alone, but the combination was protective,” says senior author 
<br>
James C. Grotta, M.D., professor of neurology and director of the stroke 
<br>
program, University of Texas-Houston Medical School, Houston, Texas.
<br>
<p>In this study, Grotta and colleagues sought to determine the safety and 
<br>
tolerability of caffeinol in humans. 
<br>
<p>Researchers administered the combination to 23 stroke patients (16 women, 
<br>
average age 71). The patients represented a diverse racial mix: nine white, 
<br>
nine black, four Hispanic and one Asian. 
<br>
<p>“Our goal was to see if we could safely achieve the same blood levels of 
<br>
caffeinol that we achieved in our animal studies,” he says. “We discovered 
<br>
that we could use even lower doses than we used in the animal studies and 
<br>
achieve the blood levels that were neuroprotective in animals.”
<br>
<p>Moreover caffeinol, which is given by infusion, can be safely administered to 
<br>
patients who are also receiving clot-busting treatment with tissue 
<br>
plasminogen activator (tPA). Eight patients received both caffeinol and tPA. 
<br>
One patient with a very severe stroke who received caffeinol and tPA suffered 
<br>
an intracerebral hemorrhage (bleeding within the brain), but Grotta says an 
<br>
independent safety officer concluded it was not related to caffeinol.
<br>
<p>The first set of four patients were given low-dose caffeinol (caffeine 6 
<br>
milligrams per kilogram plus ethanol 0.2 grams per kilogram). That dose did 
<br>
not achieve the target blood level, so the dose was increased (8 mg/kg 
<br>
caffeine and 0.4 g/kg ethanol) in the next group of 19 patients. That 
<br>
achieved target blood levels, he says. However, Grotta cautioned that the 
<br>
ethanol level may need further adjustment because a patient with a history of 
<br>
heart disease developed reversible heart failure at that dose level. It is 
<br>
unclear how caffeinol works to protect the brain, but it is being studied.
<br>
<p>A randomized, placebo-controlled trial is needed to determine the 
<br>
neuroprotective effect of this combination. In addition, Grotta plans a study 
<br>
that will combine caffeinol with thermo-cooling of stroke patients. Other 
<br>
studies have suggested that cooling the brain can limit stroke damage, and 
<br>
Grotta says that combining cooling and caffeinol may extend that protection.
