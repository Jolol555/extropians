<em>&gt; &gt; It's worse than that--even his imaginary story isn't really
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; helpful. The fact is, Mr. Hugh M. Species did not do &quot;just
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; fine&quot; on fish, fowl, etc. In fact, he was probably near
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; starvation most of the time, and just managed to reproduce
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; once or twice before dying in his twenties of disease or
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; injury. 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You're missing the point, Lee. In those pre-medical-science times,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that was doing just fine. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm not missing anything. Yes, of course that was &quot;just fine&quot; for
<br>
him. My point is that the evidence for loss-of-health after the
<br>
advent of agriculture is harder to interpret and far more equivocal
<br>
than you make it out to be. There's no clear and meaningful measure
<br>
of &quot;health&quot; that was good before agriculture and bad afterward,
<br>
and no clear way to control such an analysis. There are lots of
<br>
tantalizing data points here and there to suggest that. And there
<br>
are lots of data points (for example, life expectancy) that were
<br>
bad before and good after, because life before agriculture was
<br>
pretty miserable all around. Now it's perfectly reasonably for you
<br>
to hypothesize that most of the post-ag improvements can be
<br>
explained away by factors other than choice of foods, and that's
<br>
probably even true. But the data just aren't nearly as clear or
<br>
reliable or one-sided as you make them sound.
<br>
<p>And even if I totally accept your choice of data and interpretations,
<br>
it still doesn't necessarily follow that the diet serves /my/ goals,
<br>
even if it does serve my /genes/'s goals. 
<br>
<p>The paleo diet is a very good theory from which to come up with
<br>
actual tests to try. And it also has another great benefit: unlike
<br>
taking the latest popular diet craze or supplement that shows promise
<br>
before the results are in, there's a few million years of history
<br>
suggesting that the paleo diet is at least unlikely to be harmful, so
<br>
it's probably safe to do it while waiting for the studies to come in.
