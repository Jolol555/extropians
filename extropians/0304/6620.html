Alex - I'd offer two points.  First, you should not panic.  There are many
<br>
more cases of colds and flu in England than SARS.  Statistically that's
<br>
what you're much more likely to have.
<br>
<p>But second, if your condition isn't clearing up after a week or so,
<br>
you should go back to the doctor, especially if you're coughing a lot.
<br>
You can get pneumonia even without SARS and it can be very serious.
<br>
I had it a few years ago and it was nasty.  A guy I work with almost
<br>
died from it and was in the hospital for a month.  Famous Muppeteer Jim
<br>
Henson died from pneumonia.  So you don't want to mess around with it.
<br>
It's easy to diagnose with a chest X-ray.
<br>
<p>The moral is, don't panic, but pay attention to what's happening.
<br>
If other people around you are getting really sick from whatever virus
<br>
it is, you are more likely to have a bad case as well.  Don't hesitate
<br>
to go back to the doctor.
<br>
