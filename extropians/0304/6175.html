<p>
Yudkowsky on the looting:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I see that troops have actually been ordered to crack 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down now.  So someone intelligent is on the scene.  I guess that's a
</em><br>
sign 
<br>
<em>&gt; of hope.
</em><br>
<p>The CENTCOM staff had to sit down and rethink it's war-time rules of
<br>
engagement to provide concrete guidelines to the troops on the ground.
<br>
Should our troops use deadly force to stop looting? If not, what level
<br>
of force is appropriate? Answering these questions takes some time, and
<br>
not a little bit of sensitivity to the current international political
<br>
situation. Personally, I think the latest reports that CENTCOM has
<br>
decentralized the issue and left it to the discretion of ground
<br>
commanders is as good a solution as any at this point. Once again Franks
<br>
has kept the President from an almost certain black eye. This
<br>
geopolitical dice roll is being rigged by the military for a win. It
<br>
remains to be seen whether the President's gamble pays out the way he's
<br>
hoping (Middle East stability, oil price stability, re-election,
<br>
historical vindication), but if it doesn't, I suspect it won't be
<br>
because our military botched it for him. Anyway, if this event makes
<br>
things worse for the world, at least Americans have hydrogen cars to
<br>
look forward to. 
<br>
<p>Predictable Catastrophe of Human Stupidity follows:
<br>
<p>Based on Schwarzenegger's recent meeting with Karl Rove we can deduce
<br>
several things: Arnie will be CA governor in 2-3 years. His bid for
<br>
President will be successful in 2008. Funding for Lockheed Martin's
<br>
prototype battle exoskeleton will be scrapped in favor of Arnie's plan
<br>
for hydrogen-powered endoskeletal augmentations. General Dynamics
<br>
changes it's name to Skynet, Inc. in 2010 and begins development. Arnie
<br>
volunteers for the first endoskeletal implants in 2011. His enhanced
<br>
campaigning abilities ensure his re-election. Many die. Augmentations
<br>
complete, he declares war on the Federated States of IntelMicrosoft, and
<br>
becomes the first commander-in-chief to actually lead American troops
<br>
into battle. Bill Gates captured and forced to participate in televised
<br>
deathmatch against augmented professional wrestlers. Televised
<br>
deathmatch becomes a popular series. In 2013, amidst plunging approval
<br>
ratings Arnie heads to Rome and faces off against Russell Crowe in the
<br>
series finale. This story shall the good man teach his son.          
<br>
