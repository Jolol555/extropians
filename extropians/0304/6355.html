<em>&gt; One problem I am dealing with is planning the curriculum. I would &gt;like to
</em><br>
teach them so many things, of course. However, realistically I &gt;have to
<br>
select. I am curious what topics any of you would want to &gt;see taught if
<br>
your own child were being homeschooled.
<br>
<p>I suggest Brainwashing, Mental Programming and How to use their brain. My
<br>
son will be partially homeschooled and i think that one of the most
<br>
important things any child can learn is how to operate themselves. How to
<br>
use their neurology.
<br>
<p>This really requires some education and training on the part of the parents
<br>
as well and at least some basic familiarity with the concepts and
<br>
applications of imprinting and conditioning. As well, it would do well for
<br>
parents to be well-versed (or have someone someone else who is well-versed)
<br>
in applied behavioral technologies; NLP, Somatics, bio-electricity, etc . .
<br>
.
<br>
<p>Also i think that its wonderful to have people that are good at things
<br>
around your child so that they have the opportunity to model the best
<br>
possible strategies from their environment. This is especially true when it
<br>
comes to the basics such as good communication, movement, sociability, etc .
<br>
. .
<br>
I think in large part what you teach your children should depend on three
<br>
major things. Your Intent for them, their other parents Intent for them, and
<br>
their own inclinations as they develop.
<br>
<p>I also wholeheartedly agree with Alex's comments.
<br>
I also reccomend checking out <a href="http://www.liarmag.com/reality03.html">http://www.liarmag.com/reality03.html</a>
<br>
there are some interesting ideas about teaching children in that issue.
<br>
<p>Best,
<br>
