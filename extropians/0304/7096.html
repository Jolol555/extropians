<p>I'm glad to see another paleo-guy in this thread. I think that makes about
<br>
2.5 of us, where Eliezer seems to be the .5 :) (I'm still not clear about
<br>
what Eliezer really thinks, given that he keeps disagreeing with me even
<br>
while I keep trying to agree with him :-)
<br>
<p>I agree in principle with what you've written above, but perhaps unlike you
<br>
I am not trying to &quot;live&quot; a paleodiet life-style. Like a lot of paleodiet
<br>
proponents I am not opposed to adding supplements and other non-paleo
<br>
substances to my diet when the evidence is strong that doing so is likely to
<br>
have benefits. 
<br>
<p>Perhaps the least paleolithic item in my diet is aminoguanidine. I take 200
<br>
mg per day of this extremely non-paleolithic chemical. I do so because
<br>
aminoguanidine is known to help prevent the production of Advanced Glycation
<br>
End-products (AGE's). Appropriately named, AGE's are implicated in many of
<br>
the diseases of aging, diseases which our paleo ancestors did not experience
<br>
much due to their shorter life-spans. 
<br>
<p>As mez points out, the forces of natural selection were blind to many of the
<br>
modern diseases of aging. For that reason we cannot rely only on pure
<br>
paleodiet theory to help us live longer. In terms of human evolution and
<br>
longevity we are now in completely uncharted territory.
<br>
<p>In my view the paleodiet is, however, still the base diet upon which we
<br>
should formulate an optimal diet. Again, it's a question of burden-of-proof.
<br>
As I see it, any deviation from the paleodiet needs to be justified by solid
<br>
scientific evidence.
