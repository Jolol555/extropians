<p><em>&gt; Going back for a moment to the very first message of this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; thread. 
</em><br>
<p>In case it's not clear to everyone, &quot;this thread,&quot; is splattered all over
<br>
the place. It began with discussion of diet and health in a thread called
<br>
&quot;FITNESS: Diet and Exercise&quot; started as I recall by one of our fearless
<br>
leaders during the height of the massive pixel crunch here about Iraq. Then
<br>
thanks probably to my obnoxious tenacity about paleodiet theory it moved to
<br>
a new thread called &quot;Evolution and Diet (was FITNESS: Diet and Exercise).&quot;
<br>
The discussion has finally landed here in its proper place, thanks I think
<br>
to Eliezer who responded to me here from the second thread above.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; The theory goes that in Europe people discovered brewing,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relying on the alcohol content of beer to do the job, while
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the Far East people discovered tea, relying on the boiling
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of water to do probably a better job. 
</em><br>
<p>I'm pretty sure wine appeared well before beer. Wine is a natural product of
<br>
nature, found in the fermenting fruits that prehistoric peoples surely ate
<br>
while scavenging for food. I imagine prehistoric peoples of the late
<br>
paleolithic noticing the pleasant intoxicating effects of fermented fruit
<br>
and gathering such fruits into a bowl to make primitive wine. It's possible
<br>
they also made beer, but this seems much less likely given that it requires
<br>
grains. Beer appeared probably at about the same time as agriculture --
<br>
about 12,000 B.C.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Given that beer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; consumption was not restricted to adults in those times,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; selection encouraged the spread of genes for alcohol
</em><br>
<em>&gt; detoxifying enzymes in the liver. In other words, so the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; theory goes, infants that were given water were more likely
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to die due to infection than those that were given beer were
</em><br>
<em>&gt; likely to die due to liver problems.
</em><br>
<p>Yes. Same for wine. Alcohol keeps the bacteria at bay. This was also the
<br>
justification for &quot;Grog&quot; in later years, the main drink of sailors. Ho Ho
<br>
Hum and a Bottle of Rum...
