<p>Of course in the Netherlands that's deliberate. :)
<br>
<p>Time for a rant I've wanted to get off:
<br>
Not having been able to actually visit the place, I still have this notion
<br>
that the Netherlands are the most consistently extropian place on the planet,
<br>
at least in the senses I care about.  The US may have more extreme edges, but
<br>
those co-exist with pre-Enlightenment Christianity.  The Dutch have the most
<br>
libertarian view of prostitution and drugs (not sure about their sex, although
<br>
they had a sensible statutory rape law), last I saw they seemed to have the
<br>
best balance between Europe's general social net and more US-style liberal
<br>
markets, they *make their own land* (compare that to the US's stolen frontier,
<br>
with gov't backing, not that the Dutch colonial history isn't nasty too) and
<br>
are still at it, at least they added a province in 1986.  Historically they
<br>
sheltered lots of Jews after 1492, consciously set up a red light district in
<br>
the 1600s (quoting Simon Schama, and maybe that's nothing unique but he
<br>
brought it up), were inventing tulip market bubbles while Jamestown was
<br>
starving to death, and founded what became the US's engine of capitalism (New
<br>
Amsterdam-&gt;New York.)
<br>
<p>True, they're not as anarchist as US extropians tend to be.  Possibly your
<br>
view of the world is different when you live a few feet below sea level.
<br>
&quot;Yes, we are coercing you to pay for the dikes.  Deal with it or drown.&quot;
