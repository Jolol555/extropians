<p>&lt;&lt; What was it that could have been done that 
<br>
&nbsp;would have been heard and would have stayed the hand of the

&nbsp;administration.  I really would very much like to know. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>With something as serious and important as waging war on another country, I 
<br>
think that something as simple as a popular vote on whether or not we go to 
<br>
war could be effective, IF we were presented with all sides of the issue, and 
<br>
IF people cared enough to be that well informed. That way, we couldn't really 
<br>
say that the war wasn't decided by the people rather than by the 
<br>
administration.
