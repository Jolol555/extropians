<p>There are a lot of ways to argue with it. First of all, we have very
<br>
little knowledge of what our Paleolithic ancestors actually ate. It must
<br>
be inferred from very scant evidence in the remains of the period. Many of
<br>
the things &quot;paleodieters&quot; assume must not have been in their diet very
<br>
likely were. For example, grains and legumes began to be cultivated in the
<br>
Neolithic because they had been gathered in the Mesolithic (with many
<br>
intermediary stages, as evident in studies of Near Eastern evidence).
<br>
<p>Secondly, our paleolithic ancestors, though they managed to survive by the
<br>
Darwinian standards of managing to reproduce, were hardly what we would
<br>
call &quot;healthy&quot;. They had short lifespans and their bodily remains evidence
<br>
numerous diseases and malconditions. 
<br>
<p>The history of hominids is one that bounces back and forth between
<br>
carnivory, herbivory, and omnivory, like a lot of that of mammals in
<br>
general. That implies to me that our bodies are actually probably very
<br>
flexible about diet. We evolved to eat just about anything because our
<br>
ancestors had trouble getting enough of anything. No optimal, Edenic diet
<br>
was ever discovered because humans were just barely able to stabilize
<br>
their survival, given their poor resources, tech, options, available food
<br>
sources, and predation/gathering skills. IMHO.
