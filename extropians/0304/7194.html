<em>&gt; Wrong (though often stated).  Only two (cytochrome oxidase I and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; cytochrome b) have always been found in the mt, but that's not the

</em><br>
<em>&gt; Complex I for which these are the only species that lack the genes in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the mtDNA, and of course they also lack them in the nDNA.
</em><br>
<p>### Good points.
<br>
<p>-------------------------
<br>
<p><em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Possibly the reason for stability of the mtDNA in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; evolution is not the protein import problem, but the difference in
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; the nuclear and mito genetic code.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That works for animals, but not plants (see my mail of yesterday).
</em><br>
<p>### But in plants we have huge mitos with introns, 57 genes. Either there is
<br>
another insurmountable barrier but a different one from hydrophobicity, or,
<br>
more likely IMO, plants do not have a strong selective pressure against
<br>
large mitochondrial genomes.
<br>
<p>Also, there are many highly hydrophobic proteins made in the nucleus and
<br>
imported into membranes, or through membranes.
<br>
<p>The genetic code difference makes sense to me because it implies the need
<br>
for at least three independent mutational events for mtDNA-nDNA gene
<br>
transfer in vertebrates. You have to make a nuclear pseudogene from a mtDNA
<br>
gene, then mutate it into a form which will produce a viable protein if read
<br>
by the nuclear tRNA's, and then you have to couple it to a mitochondrial
<br>
leader peptide. Each event happens all the time, but all three together
<br>
would be quite uncommon.
<br>
<p>-----------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; ### Human mt-mRNA is polycistronic.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Sort of..... it's transcribed as one message for each strand, but they
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are then chopped up and each bit polyadenylated before translation.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Two of the protein-coding products of the chopping-up are dicistronic,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the rest mono.
</em><br>
<p>### Yes, three polycistronic transcripts getting chopped up.
<br>
<p>--------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; Is there some alpha-synuclein in lysosomes simply because stuff ends
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; up in lysosomes, or is it's presence in the lysosomes the mechanism
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; of its detrimental action?  This has not been answered so far, AFAIK.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I agree, but who cares? -- the only thing that matters is whether NON-
</em><br>
<em>&gt; lysosomal alpha-synuclein is bad for cells, and no one has postulated
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any way that it could be.
</em><br>
<p>### You lost me here. For the outcome of a xenohydrolase treatment it
<br>
definitely matters whether the lysosomal aggregates are detrimental or not.
<br>
<p>-----------------------
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt;&gt; ### Atheromatous material may be difficult to digest, but is not
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; non-digestible. With some treatments you can have regression of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; atherosclerotic changes implying digestion of macroscopic amounts of
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; plaque. There is a dynamic balance between plaque accumulation and
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; digestion.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That doesn't follow.  At any given instant, there will certainly be a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; proportion of the atheroma core that's digestible (and is indeed being
</em><br>
<em>&gt; digested).  That proportion will diminish as a result of treatments
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that slow down the arrival of new material, etc., so the total size
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the plaque will also diminish.  But that doesn't tell us whether
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there is *also* stuff there that *can't* be degraded.  In fact we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say with confidence that there is, because the plaque appears out of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; nothing.  The originating macrophages that enter our artery wall in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; youth, for example, can only become foam cells by hanging out ther
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and taking in a steady stream of LDL etc and failing to break it all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; down -- else they would remain as healthy macrophages forever.
</em><br>
<p>### You are talking about the so called &quot;fatty streaks&quot;, right? Fatty
<br>
streaks can fully disappear. The only way you can tell there is totally
<br>
indigestible stuff in the plaque is if you cannot digest it in vitro in cell
<br>
culture, and if injected in vivo in a young animal, it doesn't get
<br>
phagocytosed. Otherwise the existence of humanly indigestible plaque is a
<br>
hypothesis, and interesting one, but not a theory or fact.
<br>
<p>---------------------------
<br>
<p>&nbsp;Same
<br>
<em>&gt; goes for the core of the mature plaque -- there's a constant stream
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on new macrophages arriving all the time to do battle with it, and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; if they were able to break down everything there they would do so.
</em><br>
<p>### A different explanation is that there is a dynamic balance between the
<br>
influx of digestible fatty material, and the ability of endothelium and
<br>
macrophages to deal with it. As time goes by, the balance tilts towards
<br>
buildup, with first only occasional macrophages dying, then as the quality
<br>
of macrophages goes down with age (and it does), there isn't enough to deal
<br>
with plaque even if it's still digestible, also because of scarring, and
<br>
calcification.
<br>
<p>To my knowledge, there is still no final answer on atherosclerosis.
<br>
<p>---------------------------------
<br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; it is indeed possible to replace full length mtDNA now, so it's
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; just a matter of time before somebody manages to do something useful
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt; with it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Probably not in respect of aging.  Unfortunately it seems that the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mutant mtDNA molecule has a selective advantage in post-mitotic cells
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and clonally expands at the expense of the wild-type, eventually
</em><br>
<em>&gt; taking over the whole cell.  This process would overcome any attempt
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to replace mutant mtDNA by wild-type copies.  No one has come up with
</em><br>
<em>&gt; any feasible way to reverse this selective pressure (and not for want
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of trying!).  Putting in mtDNA that reduces superoxide production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; may be a different matter though -- but (broken record time) that's
</em><br>
<em>&gt; just retardation, not repair/reversal/obviation.
</em><br>
<p>### It is not clear that the mutant sequences, aside perhaps from some
<br>
deletion mutants, have a selective advantage. Chinnery and Turnbull did some
<br>
calculations showing that mtDNA can widely fluctuate and fix mutations into
<br>
homozygosity if only random processes are taken into account. A mutational
<br>
ratchet mechanism tends to favor mutated DNA's in a 3 to 1 ratio, but this
<br>
is not a selective advantage.
<br>
<p>Actually, once you have mitofection, there are at least two feasible methods
<br>
to select the mutated mtDNA's out of the cell. Previous attempts failed
<br>
because of lack of the ability to introduce DNA into mitos, but this has now
<br>
changed.
