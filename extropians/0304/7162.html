<p><em>&gt; Hmm.  The Atkins diet has basically no carbs and you lose weight.  Does that

</em><br>
<p>Well, the short answer is that you're supposed to include carbs again
<br>
to stop.  You gradually increase your carb quota by 5 gm/day, one week
<br>
at a time, until your weight loss stops.
<br>
<p>However in practice I don't think you would shrink away to nothing
<br>
under Atkins.  Some people fail to lose weight on it, or lose weight
<br>
for a while and then stop.  A recent meta-analysis suggested that weight
<br>
loss on low-carb diets is primarily due to lower caloric intake rather
<br>
than the low carbs themselves.  It's possible that the absence of carbs
<br>
makes it easier to tolerate and stick to a low calory diet.
<br>
<p>This meta-analysis article was described here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-04/sumc-srr040303.php">http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2003-04/sumc-srr040303.php</a>
<br>
<p>the abstract is here:
<br>
<a href="http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/14/1837">http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/abstract/289/14/1837</a>
<br>
<p>and I put the full text online here:
<br>
<a href="http://www.finney.org/~hal/jama_atkins.pdf">http://www.finney.org/~hal/jama_atkins.pdf</a>
<br>
<p>(Actually on scanning over the full article and its tables, it looks to
<br>
me like the summary statements are oversimplifications.  The data seems
<br>
consistent with low carb diets being better for weight loss even at
<br>
similar caloric levels.  The problem is that the many different studies
<br>
analyzed all did things so differently that it is hard to compare them.)
