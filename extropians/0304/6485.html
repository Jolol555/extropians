<em>&gt; &gt; One of many things I fancy about Greg is his candor.  (Psst 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; - I'll be 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; checking him out in a few weeks on our scuba diving vacation. :-))
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;[the whole scuba thing is just an excuse to see Natasha in a skin-tight
<br>
black rubber suit ...]
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; I'm curious about the attraction of Scuba.  
</em><br>
<p>Well, you've pushed one of my buttons.  Scuba is a VERY extropian sport:
<br>
It's a melding of human and machine for the purpose of experiencing new
<br>
things and developing new abilities.  If it's not THE most extropian
<br>
sport, it's got to be in the top two or three.  There's lots to learn in
<br>
terms of technique and background information in physics and biology
<br>
and, for the gadget-head, there's no end to the cool STUFF you get to
<br>
play with.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If danger is part of the attraction, why not do something 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that gives a more intense sensation of danger with lower 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; risk, like skydiving or bungee jumping (my father and I did a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; jump from a railroad bridge over Feather River canyon 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; once--that was an experience I am glad to have had but feel 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; no compulsion to repeat)?
</em><br>
<p>As you saw from the figures you just posted, basic recreational diving
<br>
isn't very dangerous at all.  Almost every accident of any kind or
<br>
fatality I've ever read or heard about in the realm of recreational
<br>
diving has been a result of bone-headed stupidity.  (I read technical
<br>
reports of dive accidents to keep myself sharp, and there's a definite
<br>
evolution-in-action effect in most accidents that happen to open-water
<br>
divers in depths above 40 meters.) &quot;Technical diving&quot; -- i.e. diving in
<br>
more demanding conditions -- has a higher accident rate because the
<br>
margin for error is smaller and the result of mistakes or equipment
<br>
failures is more quickly problematic.
<br>
<p>At any rate, the &quot;thrill&quot; aspects of diving come and go, but the
<br>
satisfaction (for me, at least) is never-ending.  Especially the feeling
<br>
of weightlessness and flight is, for me, the capture in real life of
<br>
experiences we only have in normal life fleetingly in dreams.  Now that
<br>
I'm a more experienced diver and the basic technique can drop into the
<br>
background of my consciousness for many minutes at a time, I often allow
<br>
myself to drift into a state of utter serenity that is very hard to
<br>
recreate on dry land down here at the bottom of Earth's gravity well.
<br>
One very cool thing about scuba is that being good at it requires
<br>
careful breath control for fine buoyancy adjustment and, ultimately,
<br>
submerged duration.  This naturally causes you to become calmer and
<br>
calmer as you get better and better.  The result of being truly in
<br>
control of your breathing as a diver is very much the same as the
<br>
breath-control of the accomplished meditator.  In fact, on a simple
<br>
dive, the challenge is to keep sharp on the technical things when the
<br>
lure of weightlessness and flight is there.  But then, one can always
<br>
&quot;up the ante&quot; with some new technical challenge.  In the last couple of
<br>
years I've split the price of a god digital video rig and running that
<br>
at 120 feet keeps me sharp and focused.
<br>
<p>Then -- especially in tropical diving -- there's the incredible new
<br>
living world you're exposed to.  Seeing a tropical aquarium just doesn't
<br>
convey the experience of gliding above a shallow coral reef, or
<br>
exploring a deep wall.  The density and diversity of life just can't be
<br>
comprehended from a flat video screen.  Every square inch of a mature,
<br>
healthy coral reef is a microcosm of life on the planet, with a depth of
<br>
ecology that plays out before your eyes in a way that nothing on land
<br>
can equal.  Then there's the occasional encounter with a big pelagic or
<br>
sea turtle or ray or giant grouper that gives you a sense of the
<br>
immensity of some of the life in the ocean.  When you surface from a
<br>
dive like that, you can't believe the biological poverty we experience
<br>
most of the time.  You've got to be there and see it to believe how
<br>
wonderful this is.
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; So why Scuba?
</em><br>
<p>I guess I'd answer -- why not?
