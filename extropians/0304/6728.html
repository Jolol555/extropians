<p><em> &gt; But forbidding a below-minimum wage contract does not make the poor
</em><br>
<em> &gt; person more likely to have a &quot;dignified existence&quot;. Quite the contrary, as
</em><br>
<em> &gt; evidenced by current levels of unemployment. Regardless of one's ideology,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; minimum wage laws are irrational, whether you want to benefit the rich or
</em><br>
<em> &gt; the poor.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;As far as I'm aware there's no substantial empirical evidence linking
<br>
&nbsp;unemployment with increases in the minimum wage, if there were such a
<br>
&nbsp;strong effect as you suggest I'd expect such data to be easy to come
<br>
&nbsp;by. Certainly blaming the current economic downturn on the minimum
<br>
&nbsp;wage is foolish, several steps sillier than the choice of words you
<br>
&nbsp;call me on below.
<br>
<p>&nbsp;But I do want to be clear I'm sympathetic to your position - it may
<br>
&nbsp;well be, in the final analysis, the minimum wage is simply not a very
<br>
&nbsp;useful tool for achieving the kind of ideological objective I
<br>
&nbsp;outlined in my previous post. I might add &quot;irrational&quot; is a loaded
<br>
&nbsp;term, that we disagree doesn't necessarily mean I'm foaming at the
<br>
&nbsp;mouth: One could look at the minimum wage as a legislative mechanism
<br>
&nbsp;for mitigating the enormous transaction costs inherent to collective
<br>
&nbsp;bargaining. (I liked Damien Sullivan's remark on this point further
<br>
&nbsp;up this thread very much.)
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;One point to be clear about though, and one that often doesn't get
<br>
&nbsp;taken seriously enough in this sort of abstract argument from
<br>
&nbsp;principle, is that while a particular policy tool might not be the
<br>
&nbsp;ideal choice from the perspective of an armchair theorist, it might
<br>
&nbsp;be the only one which is politically achievable. Even if we were to
<br>
&nbsp;agree the minimum wage is an inefficient means of achieving a goal,
<br>
&nbsp;one might still support it because it's here, it does some good, and
<br>
&nbsp;the superior alternatives aren't going to happen. If you actually
<br>
&nbsp;want to talk about the real world, you've got to deal with what is
<br>
&nbsp;and not what should be: I'd trade the minimum wage for a negative
<br>
&nbsp;payroll tax in an instant, but as a practical matter it's foolish to
<br>
&nbsp;let the good be the enemy of the just-about-adequate.
<br>
<p><em> &gt; Also, the use of &quot;dignity&quot; as a general catch-phrase to bolster one's
</em><br>
<em> &gt; ideology is manipulative. No nice person would oppose &quot;dignity&quot;, and this is
</em><br>
<em> &gt; why so many want to twist the meaning of the word to sell the pet project.
</em><br>
<em> &gt; There is nothing undignified with sharing an apartment with others (as I do,
</em><br>
<em> &gt; to save money). If I can do it, the janitors can do it as well.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;But that's the whole point of rhetoric, to make such a compelling
<br>
&nbsp;case no reasonable, nice person could possibly disagree!
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;What I mean by dignity is open to discussion, it's an admittedly
<br>
&nbsp;vague concept: I live in Manhattan where you can barely find a *room*
<br>
&nbsp;in a shared apartment for less than $1000 a month: If the woman who
<br>
&nbsp;cleans my place has to take the train in I don't see that as any
<br>
&nbsp;great insult to the rights of man. I would like her to be able to go
<br>
&nbsp;to the doctor when she gets sick though, or get her teeth fixed if
<br>
&nbsp;they start to hurt, and maybe even take her kid to a movie and buy
<br>
&nbsp;some popcorn every once in a while. Does that give you a better sense
<br>
&nbsp;what I'm getting at?
<br>
<p><em> &gt; There is much more dignity in honest work than in demanding
</em><br>
<em> &gt; freebies.
</em><br>
<p>&nbsp;And who could possibly disagree with that. :)
