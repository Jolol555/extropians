</em><br>
<p>A single person making $5.15 per hour, working 6 days a week, 52 weeks per
<br>
year would have gross wages of $12,854.40 for the year. (minimum wage
<br>
people, unless they're getting help from someone else such as parents, have
<br>
to work 6 days a week to even begin to make ends meet. Many, many of them
<br>
hold down at least 2 jobs. Usually one of the jobs is part time and one is
<br>
full time, but some people do 2 full time jobs.).
<br>
<p>For 2002, this person would have had $797 in FICA taxes withheld, $186 for
<br>
Medicare, and $518 for federal income tax. On top of this, depending on
<br>
where the person lived, they might also have to pay state and local income
<br>
taxes. At wages of $12,854, this person is not eligible for the Earned
<br>
Income Credit.
