<p>Things are only practical if they have the effect you want. Unfair laws
<br>
promulgated by short-sighted ignoramuses, enforced by prejudiced bullies,
<br>
judged by narrow-minded good ole boys, and ending in over-crowded prisons
<br>
in nightmarishly inhumane conditions is not what I would call a &quot;justice
<br>
system&quot;, to the extent that I share a folk model of what justice is or
<br>
ought to look like.
<br>
<p>People are already working on applications of the concepts I suggested,
<br>
even if they don't realize it. People who are trying to figure out ways to
<br>
build a working sense of responsibility in kids rather than assuming they
<br>
have it. People who are trying to set up conditions to prevent injustice
<br>
and criminality rather than assuming it must happen and being ready to
<br>
penalize it. People who are trying to feed self-correction information
<br>
into the streams of crooked and dysfunctional systems. People are working
<br>
on it...
