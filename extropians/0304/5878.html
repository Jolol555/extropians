<p>Well, it doesn't.  Not magically.  Just because there's high compensation and
<br>
thus potential demand for automation doesn't mean the technology can actually
<br>
automate.   Otherwise we could get rid of those $6million CEOs or $60,000
<br>
computer programmers.  We can't; no reason to assume that $10,000 janitors are
<br>
automatable away either.

</em><br>
<p>I think no salutatry effects is stronger than is needed here.  It just has to
<br>
be less salutary than giving more money to the workers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 2. There is no supply and demand relationship affecting the

</em><br>
<p>Demand can be relatively inelastic.  Drugs, food, medicine, janitorial needs
<br>
of large corporations... at some wage rate this may break down (or cause a
<br>
black market), but minimum wage may be effective below that rate.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 3. Jobs are givens: in black and white terms, society needs
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p><em>&gt; 5. The number of employers and number of jobs are fixed.
</em><br>
<p>The industry may be limited by geography (access to rivers or hydropower in
<br>
old times; farms now -- only so much top quality farmland).  Other industries
<br>
have various barriers to entry -- at one extreme, auditing firms are based at
<br>
least as much on reputation for honesty as actual skill, and starting one up
<br>
will be hard.
<br>
<p>Someone said it was wrong to assume workers couldn't turn into entrepreneurs.
<br>
True, in some sense, but how many minimum-wage workers will be starting up
<br>
high-starting-capital businesses?
<br>
<p>In general, I'd say there are quite a lot of jobs which are as yet highly
<br>
resistant to automation and for which demand is fairly strong, such that up to
<br>
some point it's plausible people will just shell out more money to get the job
<br>
done.  Janitorial work.  Picking delicate agricultural products.  Probably
<br>
others.  Also note that your original assumptions, of workers &gt;&gt; employers and
<br>
workers &gt; # of jobs are kind of true -- first one definitely (remember,
<br>
workers can't magically turn into employers at will, there are capital
<br>
(including knowledge) and language and connection barriers) and the second one
<br>
somewhat, but more so when considering immigration and the vast pool of cheap
<br>
labor out in the world.
