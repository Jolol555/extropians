<p><p><em>&gt; &gt; 1.  Will travel by space warp, but won't permit disassembly of atoms.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Space warp is &quot;magic physics&quot; at this point in time so I think we can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; set it aside until Amara, Anders or GTS come up with some more &quot;weird&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; papers out of the LANL preprint archive.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but it's philosophically interesting, IMO.  All these thought
<br>
experiments reveal our beliefs about identity.  This level is really
<br>
just a base to start from; presumably no one has an objection to
<br>
traveling through space, even if the space is curved.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 2.  Will permit teleportation, but only if the same atoms are used.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Very hard (bordering on highly improbable) -- you have to turn matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; into energy, transmit it across a distance then convert it back into
</em><br>
<em>&gt; matter.  If possible it seems likely to be *very* expensive.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, but the point is that some people argue that the very
<br>
identities of their atoms *are* important, and that they'd have
<br>
no objection to teleportation if they didn't have this lingering
<br>
feeling that &quot;their&quot; original atoms were back in the previous
<br>
teleporter pod reduced to piles of elements.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 3.  Will teleport, unless there is a delay.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Can't get around the delay unless you intend to violate speed-of-light
</em><br>
<em>&gt; constraints.  (So seems to lead back to the &quot;magic physics&quot; realm.)
</em><br>
<p>Sorry.  Here &quot;delay&quot; is meant to refer to the awkward interval
<br>
of time in which one is &quot;simultaneously&quot; in two locations.
<br>
Operationally speaking, one is teleported somewhere, and then
<br>
both the original and duplicate can see and wave to each other
<br>
on closed-circuit TV.  Yes, this is a little harder to think
<br>
about over interplanetary distances, but the principle remains
<br>
the same.  The point here is that some people *would* consent
<br>
to teleportation provided that there was no possibility from
<br>
any relativistic frame of reference to such an &quot;overlap&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 4.  Will teleport, but finds backups to be useless.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; That is plain stupid and equivalent to signing ones own death
</em><br>
<em>&gt; certificate -- I asserted this at Extro3 -- one needs distributed
</em><br>
<em>&gt; replicated intelligence to survive the natural (or even engineered)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hazard function.
</em><br>
<p>It may be stupid from an evolutionary point of view, but
<br>
I'll be the first to admit that I cling to various preferences
<br>
despite their evolutionary weakness.  Ethics, for example: in
<br>
some possible future scenarios the unethical may be able to 
<br>
outbreed the ethical, and few of us would have a completely
<br>
easy time prescribing behavior.
<br>
<p>More to the point, there exist some concepts of self, for example
<br>
concepts that would survive extremely rapid evolution, which I
<br>
think are just incorrect concepts.  Some people, who I have 
<br>
referred to as &quot;radical uploaders&quot;, e.g. Ralph Merkle, would
<br>
not mind evolving one second from now into creatures so advanced
<br>
that they would resemble us no more than we resemble the fetuses
<br>
from which we grew.  If that happened to me, I contend, then
<br>
I'd be dead as soon as it happened.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 5.  Finds backups acceptable, provided that they've had no run time.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Ok, this seems reasonable assuming some type of upload or teleportation
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (atomic pattern copying) technology becomes feasible.
</em><br>
<p>I think that it still distinguishes some people from me.
<br>
I don't care if my backup has had any run time not.  In
<br>
fact, I'd probably prefer that he has, just because I
<br>
like for me to have experience, on the whole.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 6.  Anticipates future experiences of duplicates, but only one in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     particular.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It seems hard to &quot;anticipate&quot; future experiences.  It seems to suggest
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that one can predict the future and that seems unlikely.  I think this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; point needs reframing.
</em><br>
<p>By &quot;anticipate&quot;, I simply mean the feeling that all functioning
<br>
humans have of &quot;what is about to happen to them&quot;.  In an awkward
<br>
example from my POV, suppose that my duplicate and I are each
<br>
strapped down as Nurse Ratchet approaches with a needle.  &quot;Now
<br>
which of you boys are going to get the injection today?&quot;, she inquires
<br>
with a cruel leer.  Well, whichever of us she approaches *anticipates*
<br>
the pain of the needle, while the other of us does not.
<br>
<p>Some people, I think, take this example or an unconscious formulation
<br>
of it, as their definition of self.  That's perfectly natural.  I
<br>
prefer to think of this part of myself as my &quot;animal&quot; nature, but
<br>
Rafal Smigrodzki had a description that was perhaps better than mine
<br>
when we were discussing this last summer.  I'll dig around for it.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; 7.  Logically, but not necessarily emotionally, anticipates all
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;     experiences of all duplicates past or future, near or far.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; One obviously (if one adheres to speed-of-light limits) has a problem
</em><br>
<em>&gt; with the availability of data to &quot;reintegrate&quot; the experiences of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; duplicates in &quot;real-time&quot;.
</em><br>
<p>Well, I have a very complicated thought experiment that bothered
<br>
me so bad back in 1986 that I could scarcely work.  It's based
<br>
upon Newcomb's Paradox, and the interested reader may wish to 
<br>
devise it for himself or herself.  I've never written it up 
<br>
satisfactorily, but the bare pieces that can be put together
<br>
(I think) are in <a href="http://www.leecorbin.com/UseOfNewcombsParadox.html">http://www.leecorbin.com/UseOfNewcombsParadox.html</a>
<br>
where I also give as an introduction my take on Newcomb's Paradox.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; The [foolish person who is afraid to non-destructively
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; teleport] probably is afraid that the original is going
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; to go home and sleep with his wife.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Oh, with &quot;copies&quot; you are into much more complex problems than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that -- who has the right/obligation to go to ones job in the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; morning, who is contractually obligated to make the mortgage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; payments, etc. etc.  It is a *REAL* mess.
</em><br>
<p>Because I've always intuited that my duplicate and I would
<br>
agree on all matters (seeing quite eye to eye), I have never
<br>
supposed that a sensible person would be unable to work all
<br>
this out with his duplicate.  Moreover, I claim that one should
<br>
have an extremely good feeling about the fact that one has a
<br>
duplicate, because whatever it is that you value in being alive
<br>
at all, according to physics you have twice as much to value.
<br>
<p>But your point is a good one, and forces me to acknowledge the
<br>
peculiar difficulties that would arise if one in the best of
<br>
intentions had himself duplicated, only to quickly discover a
<br>
hidden animosity or self-loathing!  Yes, indeed, there could
<br>
be frightful legal problems all of a sudden.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; Yes, although I suspect that a totally consistent value system
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; would not be compatible with the result that an intricate and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; rather marvelous assemblage of atoms (such as the original)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; should be destroyed without a good reason.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Not clear Lee -- the problem is that &quot;assembling&quot; (or disassembling)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; atoms is now difficult.
</em><br>
<p>Well, the disassembly I had in mind was just scrambling---
<br>
and sadly happens soon after any kind of death.  Getting
<br>
mangled still far above the level of constituent atoms
<br>
usually results in death.  A disintegrator ray was supposed
<br>
to just wreck your structure without harming your individual
<br>
atoms, as I recall.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But my read of what it seems like robust nanotech enables is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that it need not be that way (there are limits but it seems
</em><br>
<em>&gt; like they involve ability to deliver energy and remove heat).
</em><br>
<p>I don't think that I understand you here.  I should start a new
<br>
thread about this, however.
<br>
<p>Lee
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But the probable rates would make most individuals eyes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pop out of their heads.  So the &quot;value&quot; of an individual (as
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a physical entity) becomes much lower.  It is the information
</em><br>
<em>&gt; content (as a description of a pattern of atoms) that is valuable.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is a very different world and I don't think most people are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; anywhere near ready to deal with it (emotionally).
</em><br>
