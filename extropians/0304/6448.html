trusted, even if.  It's reputation is damaged for the next many many years (I 
<br>
am guessing for a generation).
<br>
<p>Amara,
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me rephrase that if you please.  The US does have enemies.  If you 
<br>
read The Lucifer Principle I imagine some of them would like to bring us down 
<br>
for no more reason than the ones outlined in that text.  Some of them are 
<br>
also aggressive in their intent.  I seriously doubt we could ever conduct 
<br>
ourselves in a manner that would satisfy those folks.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand in this great debate about whether or not Sadaam had 
<br>
WMDs.  This is not an academic debate.  It is closer to a street 
<br>
confrontation.  If someone threatens me and I think that person is serious 
<br>
then I will decide when the threat rises to the level of justifying a 
<br>
preemptive attack.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, there are courts, etc., that will debate my decision later but 
<br>
the operative rule in the street is that I would rather be judged by 12 than 
<br>
carried by 6.  I don't condemn George Bush and associates for making that 
<br>
same decision.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apparently we have found camps in Iraq where terrorists were trained.  
<br>
Sadaam's Gas General is on record as threatening us with Gas.  His 
<br>
information minister has said that Iraq has no Scud missiles and that he 
<br>
doesn't know why they were fired at Kuwait.
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used the word &quot;apparently&quot; not to denote doubt but to inform you 
<br>
that I have not stayed up with that issue diligently.  However I have read 
<br>
widely about the war and I have seen nothing factual to dispute our 
<br>
government.  I don't count bald statements by those known to oppose our 
<br>
policy as a fact -- they are only assertions.
<br>
Ron h.
