<em>&gt; (Samantha Atkins &lt;<a href="mailto:samantha@objectent.com?Subject=Re:%20GOV:%20US%20Reputation%20(RE:%20Arab%20World%20Stunned%20by%20Baghdad's%20Fall)">samantha@objectent.com</a>&gt;):
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; It is not &quot;being perceived as a nice guy&quot; it is being a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; reasonable well-adjusted human being rather than a paranoid that 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; believes it justifiable to kill any who might conceivably be a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; threat.  It is roughly the difference between civilization and 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the jungle.  Also, I do not believe for a minute that we can 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; hold such preemptive use of deadly force attitudes and survive 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; even the level of technology we already have much less what is 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on the way.
</em><br>
<p>That's actually a very important point: the level of technology
<br>
does make a lot of difference. Years ago, when technology and
<br>
the world economy was such that the only actors capable of doing
<br>
major damage to a country as a whole were other countries, and
<br>
the very first attack was unlikely to be decisive, it made sense
<br>
to think of defense in terms of countries, and to have a policy
<br>
of not attacking until attacked first.
<br>
<p>At today's level of technology, we're on the edge: clearly now
<br>
small non-nation groups can cause serious damage and have done
<br>
so, so the age of &quot;countries&quot; is past. But it's probably still
<br>
the case that a first strike won't be devastating, so we're
<br>
probably still not justified in attacking someone like Hussein
<br>
who is unlikely to directly cause us great harm, and doesn't
<br>
really have the means to even if he wanted to. But imagine
<br>
moving just a little bit into a very likely future, where a
<br>
weapon technology exists that would make it possible for a
<br>
single person or small group to create and deploy a weapon that
<br>
would cause major damage to an entire country without warning.
<br>
If a person existed that were clearly mentally ill, had a
<br>
history of violence, had the means to deploy such a weapon, and
<br>
a clearly expressed irrational hatred for a certain people, I
<br>
would hardly blame those people for eliminating that clear
<br>
danger to their very existence at a lower level of threat--
<br>
say, proof that he had negotiated to buy materials for that
<br>
weapon--rather than waiting for a devastating loss.
<br>
<p>An actionable threat requires all three of means, credible
<br>
intent, and immediacy. Clearly it can't be justified to react
<br>
to a threat that doesn't have the means to destroy you, or that
<br>
hasn't clearly expressed intent to, or that hasn't done
<br>
something to make you reasonably fear for your existence /now/,
<br>
when the decision has to be made. But if all three of those
<br>
are indeed present, I would consider standing idle not to be
<br>
civilized restraint, but suicidal foolishness.
