Eliezer S. Yudkowsky:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Unfortunately, the statistics you have learned is the false way. 
</em><br>
<p>Oh really?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Least squares and p-tests are but a lie and a deceiver.  To learn the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; true way you must unlearn the old knowledge and study Bayes.
</em><br>
<p>Just how old do you think I am, Eliezer? I studied Bayes also. I assure you
<br>
I was not educated prior to the 18 century! :)
<br>
<p>The principles I mentioned in my posts were not about any particular
<br>
statistical test (there are dozens of them) or about bayesian vs
<br>
frequentists interpretations of statistics. I was just espousing some very
<br>
basic principles of scientific research as exemplified in statistical
<br>
health-related research but also obvious is all scientific research. 
<br>
<p>With respect to &quot;burden-of-proof table tennis&quot;, the main bone of contention
<br>
here, the burden of proof is always on those who would challenge the status
<br>
quo, i.e., it is always on those who would offer some new theory that they
<br>
think should better explain the empirical data. 
<br>
<p>A classic case is Galileo and his attempt to prove a Copernican heliocentric
<br>
model of the solar system against the then widely accepted geocentric model.
<br>
In basic statistical research terms, the geocentric model was the &quot;null
<br>
hypothesis,&quot; or &quot;working hypothesis,&quot; accepted as valid and true by
<br>
virtually everyone at the time, while the heliocentric model was the
<br>
&quot;competing hypothesis.&quot; The burden-of-proof was on Galileo to prove the
<br>
competing hypothesis -- it was not on the scientists of his day who
<br>
believed, along with the church, that the Earth was at the center of the
<br>
solar system. 
<br>
<p>If you don't think Galileo had the burden of proof then you haven't read the
<br>
history of Galileo, and about the great burdens placed on him in his effort
<br>
to prove the heliocentric model and disprove the geocentric model.
<br>
Fortunately we are not so dogmatic or hysterical about science in this
<br>
post-enlightenment era, but the burden-of-proof concept is still a reality
<br>
of modern science, as it should be. 
<br>
<p>A more modern example: the burden-of-proof was on Einstein to show that
<br>
Newtonian physics is incomplete. Newton was under no obligation to rise from
<br>
the grave to show that Einstein was wrong. Newton was the incumbent.
<br>
Einstein was the new contender who needed to prove his theories against
<br>
Newton's.
<br>
<p>As I wrote in another post, the most successful and reputable scientists,
<br>
like Einstein and Galileo, are those who gladly shoulder the
<br>
burden-of-proof. A scientist gets an idea that the current widely accepted
<br>
working hypothesis is not as accurate a theory of reality as some other
<br>
theory, and decides to expend a lot of his time and energy and resources to
<br>
design and conduct an unbiased experiment to test whether that the other
<br>
theory explains the data better than the old working hypothesis. Those who
<br>
do so successfully advance scientific knowledge for all the world, and in so
<br>
doing they earn the respect and admiration of their peers -- a key
<br>
motivating factor for people in academia. This is true regardless of the
<br>
veracity of Bayesian theory.
<br>
<p>With respect to this thread, my point is simply that according to me and
<br>
other people who embrace paleodiet theory, paleodiet theory really ought to
<br>
be the null (working) hypothesis for optimal diet. From your posts on the
<br>
subject in which you state words something like &quot;I tend to think ancestral
<br>
diets should be the working assumption until proven wrong&quot; I think you agree
<br>
with me, Eliezer. You are saying the same thing I am saying, but in less
<br>
formal language.
<br>
<p>As an aside, sometimes in stat we don't use the term &quot;null hypothesis&quot; in a
<br>
literal way, for example when testing two competing theories in a field in
<br>
which there are no pre-existing theories, or when comparing two samples of
<br>
data expected to have different variances, but in greater terms the
<br>
principle is still there: the null hypothesis in such cases is that neither
<br>
theory explains the data better than the other.
