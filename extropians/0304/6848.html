</em><br>
<p>It is the conclusion of OPEC that, agreeing with my own predictions,
<br>
oil prices will plummet in the face of a freely producing and exporting
<br>
Iraqi oil industry, costing the muslim world's oil industries one
<br>
trillion  dollars in gross revinues.
<br>
<p>This might be more than just the revinues of the raw oil itself, but
<br>
revinues from refined products, shipping services, as well as ancillary
<br>
economic activity that depends on well paid, well employed oil industry
<br>
workers.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt;From an economic standpoint, it may make a certain amount of sense
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for countries to cut back on oil production because when production
</em><br>
<em>&gt; declines the price will increase and they can sell the reserves
</em><br>
<em>&gt; that have been conserved at that much higher price.  So it becomes
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a question of &quot;Do you want less money now or more money later?&quot;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situation.  (Assuming inflation adjustments on the value of money
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of course.)
</em><br>
<p>It doesn't quite work that way. If you look at the price history prior
<br>
to the first gulf war, you'd see that there was a significant amount of
<br>
oil overproduction and quota cheating by all oil producing nations. The
<br>
OPEC syndicate was on the verge of having absolutely no meaning. Even
<br>
Saudi Arabias effort at grossly cutting back on production could only
<br>
go so far, given that it had its own economy to support. At one point,
<br>
it switched gears and started overproducing themselves to drive the
<br>
price down so low that few nations were earning any profit on their oil
<br>
production (that oil sold at spot market prices, mind you).
<br>
<p>This essentially idled most all of the US oil industry in the late
<br>
1980's. At one point, oil prices had reached $14/bbl, and this was when
<br>
the USSR wasn't selling oil to anybody, they were only selling some
<br>
natural gas to europe.
<br>
<p>Since then, US economic activity has gotten even more energy efficient,
<br>
and our tax system is structured to boost economic activity and tax
<br>
revinues when oil prices are low. The last thing that the enemies and
<br>
rivals of the US want is low oil prices, because their systems are
<br>
almost all structured to benefit most with high oil prices.
