<em>&gt;&gt;When will you learn that I stopped considering your opinion

</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;grade plutonium were reported in anything I saw.  I suspect if
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;something like this was found it would be front page news.  If

<em>&gt;&gt;oruselves.   Otherwise take it elsewhere.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Actually, there were a lot of these report on CNN and elsewhere.  The only
</em><br>
<em>&gt; problem is that the follow-up tests always showed that they were not
</em><br>
<em>&gt; chemical weapons or plutonium.  People who believe there are weapons of mass
</em><br>
<em>&gt; destruction tend to remember all these findings.  People who don't believe
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are weapons of mass destruction tend to remember all the negative
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tests.  In the end, both sides remember clearly reports that supported their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; side.  Either way, it is too early to tell, and preliminary tests aren't
</em><br>
<em>&gt; accurate anyway.  The real answer will come weeks or months down the road.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; We either will find a smoking gun, or there will be no smoking gun.
</em><br>
<p>I follow CNN.  At no time did they report thousands of barrels 
<br>
of VX or weapons grade plutonium being found since we started 
<br>
attempting to justify this war.  So I am not sure you what you 
<br>
are referring to.  Since whatever was found was shown to be 
<br>
nothing of the kind I would assume that this would be enough to 
<br>
dispose of the so-called &quot;evidence&quot;. What findings?  The 
<br>
findings were that even the supsected things didn't pan out. It 
<br>
is not &quot;too early to tell&quot; about the particular incidents in 
<br>
quesiton.  They were tested and tested by people that would have 
<br>
referred a postive finding in most cases.  Yet they turned up 
<br>
negative.  There is no doubt about those particular tests on 
<br>
those particular materials whatsoever.  I am very surprised that 
<br>
you would suggest there is.  Either soemthing is weapons grade 
<br>
plutonium or it is not. Period.
<br>
<p>We may find other things that may or may not be a smoking gun. 
<br>
But there is no doubt whatsoever that we haven't found a smoking 
<br>
gun yet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (Or as usual in these conspiracy theories, we will have missiles that go
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slightly over their range allowance, or precursor chemicals that might be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; used to make something else, or witnesses that think they saw something
</em><br>
<em>&gt; which is long gone, etc....  And everybody will think the evidence supports
</em><br>
<em>&gt; their side.)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>Clearly none of these is adequate to support the claims of 
<br>
massive WMD that have been made here.  It will take a real 
<br>
smoking gun, the whole gun and nothing but the gun and several 
<br>
of those.
