<p>Gas Goes Solid 
<br>
Japanese researchers may have found the secret to exploiting the world’s 
<br>
untapped natural gas reserves.
<br>
<p>By David Wolman
<br>
April 11, 2003
<br>
<p>Nearly 95 percent of the known gas fields in the world are too small to 
<br>
justify the costs required pipe the gas to a plant, turn it into a liquid, 
<br>
and then transport it on specially equipped tankers.
<br>
<p><p>But a handful of researchers have an idea that could make these fields worth 
<br>
mining: rather than figure out cheaper ways to transport this cleaner-burning 
<br>
energy source from point A to point B as a liquid, why not change natural gas 
<br>
into a solid substance that’s easier and cheaper to transport?  
<br>
<p>Japanese researchers Hajime Kanda and Yasuhara Nakajima at Mitsui Engineering 
<br>
and Shipbuilding in Tokyo think they’ve found a solution with the aid of 
<br>
hydrates, solid crystals in which natural gas—composed chiefly of methane—is 
<br>
caged inside of water molecules. 
<br>
<p>For decades, researchers have been looking for ways to gather these crystals 
<br>
from their deep-ocean deposits and reap what they expect could be a natural 
<br>
gas harvest. Kanda and Nakajima are taking an opposite approach. Rather than 
<br>
extracting methane from hydrates, they want to turn methane into hydrates—
<br>
essentially, transforming the colorless and odorless gas into small pellets 
<br>
that can be easily stored, transported, and eventually turned back into 
<br>
natural gas. A few months ago Mitsui, in partnership with Osaka University, 
<br>
opened a demonstration plant near Tokyo to promote the concept and show that 
<br>
it works. If the Mitsui’s process proves feasible and economical, many 
<br>
untapped natural gas deposits could become vital energy sources.
<br>
<p>Changing natural gas into a hydrate form for cheaper transport gained 
<br>
attention in the early 1990s. Norwegian petroleum engineers first proposed 
<br>
the idea after comparing the transport economics of liquid natural gas to 
<br>
natural gas hydrates, knowing that hydrates could store large amounts of 
<br>
natural gas in a small space. “More than 180 standard cubic feet of gas can 
<br>
be stored in one cubic foot of hydrate,&quot; says Rudy Rogers, professor of 
<br>
chemical engineering at Mississippi State University, and an authority on 
<br>
industrial use of gas hydrates.
<br>
<p>Another major advantage: “transporting natural gas as hydrates can be done at 
<br>
lower temperature and pressure than liquid natural gas, and the risk of 
<br>
ignition in transport is much lower,” explains Hugh Guthrie, who studies 
<br>
natural gas at the U.S. Department of Energy's National Energy Technology 
<br>
Laboratory in Morgantown, WV. Much of the high cost of liquid natural gas 
<br>
comes from temperature and pressure demands on piping, shipping, and storage 
<br>
facilities.
<br>
<p>Producing  the hydrates requires mixing natural gas with water in a 
<br>
continuously stirred tank reactor. When gas is piped into the water from the 
<br>
bottom, hydrates form on the surface of the gas bubbles. Removing the 
<br>
residual water leaves behind a residue of hydrate powder. Kanda and Nakajima 
<br>
envision a hydrate-pellet production plant close to gas fields in Southeast 
<br>
Asia. From there, a pellet carrier would transport the hydrate load to plants 
<br>
where the pellets would be turned back into gas and piped to market. 
<br>
<p>The company’s demonstration plant produces as much as 600 kilograms of 
<br>
hydrates per day, moving the methane through all the necessary phases: 
<br>
hydrate formation, storage, pelletizing, and “controlled dissociation,” or 
<br>
separation of the gas and water. Whereas a liquid natural gas facility 
<br>
requires temperatures of -162 ºC, Mitsui’s plant operates at -10 ºC, which 
<br>
means huge savings in cooling costs. Kanda says the project, which is 
<br>
co-sponsored by the government’s New Energy and Industrial Technology 
<br>
Development Organization, demonstrates that hydrates can be a successful 
<br>
vector for gas transport.
<br>
<p>Mitsui’s only significant competition in gas hydrate technology comes from 
<br>
another Japanese company, Mitsubishi. Mitsubishi is pursuing its own 
<br>
gas-to-solid technology based on a hydrate-oil slurry, a process whose main 
<br>
drawback is that it produces thousands of tons of excess water that need to 
<br>
be removed. 
<br>
<p>Because hydrates are still a mysterious substance, there are many scientific 
<br>
and engineering obstacles that could make the process cost prohibitive. But 
<br>
Kanda and his colleagues are optimistic. Japan, the world’s number two energy 
<br>
consumer, is investing heavily in hydrate research, especially as public 
<br>
opinion turns increasingly against nuclear energy as a crude-oil alternative. 
<br>
Mitsui researchers hope their tiny white pellets will be just what their 
<br>
country needs.
