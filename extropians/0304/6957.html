<em>&gt; And of course, EVERYONE should read &quot;Snowcrash&quot; by Neil Stephenson!!!
</em><br>
<em>&gt; :D
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Haven't read &quot;Snowcrash&quot;, its hard to find around here. Have read
<br>
&quot;Cryptonomicon&quot;, though, which is a highly extropic novel (it even
<br>
features analogs of extropians that Neal calls &quot;Eutropians&quot;). Cryonics
<br>
bracelets run rampant through the novel. Read it several times.
<br>
<p>I endorse the list above, adding Asimov, H Beam Piper (very hard to
<br>
find, but essential if you like Heinlein), Jerry Pournelle (who often
<br>
collaborates with Niven), and lately have been enjoying S.M. Stirling. 
<br>
<p>His &quot;Island&quot; trilogy was a fantastic alternate reality/time travel
<br>
series, and his current release, &quot;The Peshawar Lancers&quot; is a very
<br>
engrossing look at an alternate reality where an asteroid strike hit
<br>
earth in the 1870's, leaving the remnants of the British Empire to pick
<br>
up the pieces, centered in India. The story is set in the year 2025,
<br>
when most technology has revived to the point of about 1910, with a few
<br>
exceptions like massive building sized mechanical 
<br>
'difference engines' and DNA research. Horse cavalry, Stirling engine
<br>
propelled zeppelins, and specially bred female russian seeresses are
<br>
featured...
<br>
<p>Culturally, the &quot;Angrezi Raj&quot;, as this Second Empire is called, is just
<br>
transitting from a Victorian sensibility, crossed with the Indian caste
<br>
system, and attempting to overlay a whiggish sense of equal rights and
<br>
opportunities.
<br>
<p>Beyond this, I have read a lot of L.E. Modesitt, Steve Barnes and John
<br>
Barnes, as well as various novels of The Culture.
<br>
<p>Fiction is an essential complement to non-fiction. While non-fiction
<br>
conveys information about what is, it does little to convey ideas about
<br>
what could, should, or might be. As such, it is essentially imagination
<br>
limiting in nature.
<br>
<p>Of course, it is possible to go too far in the other direction. For
<br>
example, I have been extremely annoyed to find that current day doctors
<br>
still use primitive sutures in abdominal surgery. My mother nearly died
<br>
and is going on over 3 months in the hospital specifically because of
<br>
this stagnated technology. Between lots of SF reading, SF television,
<br>
and most of my non-local socialization going on over this list, I was
<br>
under an impression that we had developed something better by this
<br>
point in time.
<br>
<p>&quot;You mean they actually ALLOW people to engage in elective abdominal
<br>
surgery with only catgut holding them together!?!?!?!?!&quot;
<br>
<p>If anyone is aware of any new technologies in this area, I'd love to
<br>
hear about them.
