Damien from Caltech opined:
<br>
<p>&lt;&lt;France, Russia, Germany.  Say they're glad Hussein's out of power, but 
<br>
that's
<br>
not the point.  &quot;80 percent of all countries fall short of Western democratic
<br>
standards, do we go to war with all of them?&quot;
<br>

<p>Yes, economically.They supported the bastard politically and monetarily. 
<br>
Maybe no more VW's sold in the US via direct shipment or 3rd countries. Get 
<br>
American tourists to boycott France and Germany. No more, most favored 
<br>
nations treatment with Putin. Why? recent vintage military shipments of AA 
<br>
missles (Roland) from France via Syria, found 2 weeks ago at Saddam airport. 
<br>
One missle had successfully downed an A-10 Thunderbolt. No more night vision 
<br>
lenses from Russia, that went to the Republican Guards. No American blood for 
<br>
Euro's and Rubles! This should now be the chant. Also Mother Russia is 
<br>
hotting-up the Far East (to their own advanatge) by selling their best 
<br>
military equipment, including subs and aircraft carriers to China. Do 
<br>
countries ever change?
<br>
<p>Saavy? They (Axis of weasels) supported big-time dictatorships, and any 
<br>
dictatorships that we currently support, or trade with (China) they also 
<br>
trade with and make smoochy smoochy with. They are even more cynical then we 
<br>
are, and that unfortunately is saying something, something bad! I never took 
<br>
Bushes &quot;War on Terrorism&quot; as a cleverly analyzed policy, but rather a 
<br>
reaction to 9-11. The more accuate phrase would be &quot;a war on Jihadism, or 
<br>
Islamic Radicalism,&quot; but that makes our State Department crowd nervous 
<br>
(good!), but it is also more honest. 
<br>
<p>My frequent posts concerning energy, to this list, are in part, my attempt to 
<br>
raise awareness on how people (nonviolently) can help decouple America from 
<br>
vulnerability to OPEC, and its jolly friends in the world. This is also an 
<br>
Extropic need because any energy/economic system that relies in part or whole 
<br>
on primative monarchies, and co-mingled thugs, is bound for a-hurtin'.
