Robert Bradbury:
<br>
<em>&gt; They should *not* have to be the same atoms (pointing out
</em><br>
<em>&gt; a problem with one of Lee's &quot;levels&quot;) but allows teleporting
</em><br>
<em>&gt; to be an information transmission problem and not a matter
</em><br>
<em>&gt; transmission problem (which gets more expensive).  
</em><br>
<p>Polzik [1] realized a quantum entanglement between two caesium
<br>
gas clouds, containing 10^12 atoms each. Entanglements of such
<br>
large objects (containing similar, or identical, elements) enables 
<br>
*collective* properties (such as global spin) to be teleported 
<br>
from an object to another. 
<br>
<p>But according to the usual teleportation protocol, to teleport
<br>
a human body, information from each of those 10^30 atoms
<br>
should be extracted, &quot;trasferred&quot;, and reassembled elsewhere.
<br>
Leaving the fidelity problem apart, this would require a *very*
<br>
long time, of course.
<br>
<p>But - who knows? - some powerful trick might be hidden in an 
<br>
already well known mistery.
<br>
<p>Let us say we wish to communicate to a friend far away, or we 
<br>
wish to re-create a simple quantum state, i.e. like this one
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|psi&gt; = cos l |up&gt; + sin l |down&gt; e^(i k)
<br>
Here we have two real numbers, l and k. Thus, if we try to
<br>
communicate this *known* quantum state, by classical means, 
<br>
we need an infinite - at least in principle - number of
<br>
classical bits. And imagine the number of classical bits
<br>
we must provide if we are trying to communicate, by classical
<br>
means, or re-create a quantum state which is *unknown*!
<br>
<p>Now, if we try to teleport the same simple quantum state, *known*
<br>
or *unknown*, it happens that teleportation can be achieved by 
<br>
transmitting (with classical means) just two (!) classical bits, 
<br>
provided, of course, we already set the usual teleporting set-up 
<br>
and protocol.
<br>
<p>Thus, there may be some possible mystery. But where? Well, this 
<br>
seems to be a true mystery, at present. Many authors try to
<br>
locate the *missing* or the *extra* information. 
<br>
<p>I.e. Vaidman [2] seems inclined to solve the mystery by means of 
<br>
(his version of) MWI. His idea is that the local measurement of 
<br>
the teleportation procedure splits the world in such a manner that 
<br>
in each of the worlds the state of the remote particle differs 
<br>
from the state to be teleported by some known transformation. 
<br>
The number of those worlds is small. And that explains why the 
<br>
information which has to be transmitted, by classical means, 
<br>
for teleporting a quantum state, is much much smaller than the 
<br>
information needed for the creation of the same quantum state.
<br>
<p>Lucien Hardy [3] there are reasons for believing that *non-locality*
<br>
(in Bell's terms: non-local-causality; in Einstein's terms:
<br>
non-separability) may play an important role in quantum teleportation.
<br>
He seems (sometimes) to speculate that, when a quantum state is
<br>
teleported to the remote location, the *missing* information 
<br>
(or some *extra* information) is being carried by the non-local 
<br>
properties of the entanglement itself.
<br>
<p>Barrett [4] suggests that the mystery is resolved if we consider
<br>
the quantum state (to be teleported) as a description (Schroedinger
<br>
used to call it a &quot;catalogue&quot;) of an ensemble of systems, rather
<br>
than a single system. But, imo, this position (statistical 
<br>
interpretation) is just a smooth version of Vaidman's position
<br>
(MWI, which is the reification of the old statistical interpretation).
<br>
<p>There are many more papers about the same subject, of course from 
<br>
Steiner [5] but also from Popescu, Zukowski, Cerf, Gisin, ...
<br>
<p>At present everything seems to move around a certain idea of 
<br>
non-locality. Entanglement. Bell's theorem. Cloning. Teleportation. 
<br>
And hidden transmissions of informations :-)
