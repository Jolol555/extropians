<p>Congratulations on your new body, Greg!
<br>
<p>I've been on a reducing diet myself for a couple of months. Since I went
<br>
back to the full-time practice of law, I've been leading a more sedentary
<br>
lifestyle than I had been before, and my clothes were getting too tight. I
<br>
was determined not to go out and buy larger clothes. That would have been
<br>
admitting defeat, the first step along the Highway to Hugeness.
<br>
<p>I found it quite helpful to change my attitude toward food. Instead of
<br>
regarding food as an aesthetic experience, I've switched (at least for the
<br>
duration of the reducing period) to thinking of it strictly as fuel, except
<br>
for chocolate and coffee. And fresh garden greens with vinagarette dressing.
<br>
Those I still regard as an aesthetic experiences. (I don't think chocolate's
<br>
all that fattening if you eat 75%+  pure chocolate).
<br>
<p>I found lunch the most difficult meal of the day to arrange for, since I
<br>
usually eat it away from home. Most restaurants are hopeless. So I decided
<br>
to use a liquid meal substitute. I found that the Atkins one was the
<br>
tastiest and also one of the few that wasn't loaded with sugar. So I guess
<br>
you could say I'm on a modified Atkins diet. But I find that I feel really
<br>
crappy without *some* carbohydrates, especially just before exercising.
<br>
Here's the deal: stored fat in the body has to be made from food. People
<br>
can't photosynthesize. So if you don't eat more calories than you burn,
<br>
you're not going to gain weight. I don't see how the source of the calories
<br>
could be terribly important, long as you're getting the nutrients you need
<br>
and enough fiber to keep everything moving through. From the research I've
<br>
seen, it looks as though different people need different proportions of
<br>
various nutrients. There isn't any one diet that's right for everyone.
<br>
Ideally, one should experiment with different quantities of each kind of
<br>
food, pay close attention to one's body, and eat what works best. Which
<br>
probably changes over the lifespan of each individual.
<br>
<p>As far as quick and easy meals -- for anyone who enjoys gardening, once you
<br>
get a garden established it doesn't take very much time each day to keep it
<br>
going, and fresh foods don't require elaborate cooking to taste good. I
<br>
recently moved to the city and have only a small yard, but at the moment I'm
<br>
harvesting lettuce, chard, spinach, and parsely from the garden and
<br>
dandelion greens from neighboring weed lots (although the dandelions are
<br>
beginning to go to seed, which makes the greens bitter). The fresh stuff is
<br>
SO much better than grocery store produce. I can't put my hands on any
<br>
published research on the subject, but the fresh stuff HAS to have more
<br>
vitamins than stuff that was harvested several days earlier.
<br>
