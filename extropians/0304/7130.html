<p>Yes it is very compatible with at least the basic principles of nutrition.
<br>
I'm still waiting for someone to show me solid scientific evidence that
<br>
unfortified non-paleo foods like bread and milk are worthwhile additions to
<br>
the diet. The same people who criticize me here for arguing from an
<br>
evolution science premise rather than from a nutrition science premise are
<br>
the same people who have nothing positive to say about the nutritional value
<br>
of non-paleolithic foods. 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If I were trying to convince someone of the paleo diet, I'd
</em><br>
<em>&gt; start by positioning it as a diet that reflects the best

</em><br>
<p>As I see it the problem with your suggested approach is that 1) it hands the
<br>
ball to the nutritionists to tell us what to eat. Their record so far is not
<br>
very good relative to paleodiet theory. Nutritionists told us how to compose
<br>
the USDA food pyramid, for example, and I think most of us here are
<br>
intelligent enough to know that the USDA food pyramid is a failure; and 2)
<br>
there is no clear consensus among nutritionists about the finer details of
<br>
proper diet in the first place. When you say you would &quot;start by positioning
<br>
it as a diet that reflects the best current science&quot; you are opening up a
<br>
huge can of worms. Some experts in the field believe low-carb, high-protein
<br>
diets are best while others believe low-fat high-grain diets are best. Both
<br>
camps make some compelling arguments. That debate is not even close to
<br>
resolution. 
<br>
<p>Incidentally, Dr. Atkins passed away a few days ago after suffering a
<br>
massive brain injury from slipping and falling on the icy streets of NY
<br>
City. As most people know, Atkins was the main voice for the low-carb
<br>
high-protein camp. It is not clear who will take his place in the national
<br>
debate about diet.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Anyway, that's my $.02.  This has been an enjoyable and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; educational thread for me.  Thanks all.
</em><br>
<p>Glad you're enjoying it. I am also. For much of my life I was devoted to
<br>
understanding and advising people regarding finance. In this part of my life
<br>
I am devoted to understanding and advising people regarding health. This is
<br>
what I do.
