</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; extending the line of reasoning you started in this thread might lead in
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I am one of the 1,001 types of relativists, but not an &quot;absolute
</em><br>
<em>&gt; relativist&quot;. I don't owe blind loyalty to &quot;moralities&quot; (evolved human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; customs which may be irrational or non-beneficial to me), but I have a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; situated viewpoint, and an embodiment, which give me a very definite
</em><br>
<em>&gt; subjective position. That position undergirds my &quot;aesthetics&quot; because I am
</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; may also be just as aware of how things matter *to them*, which could be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; something very different than it is with me.
</em><br>
<p>### If interpreted in this sense, all of us are relativist, including
<br>
me, but this is not really the sense I objected to.
<br>
<p>--------------------
<br>
&nbsp;
<br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; To summarize my impressions about your views, you were saying that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &quot;force&quot; or &quot;violence&quot; are strictly aesthetic concepts, have no important
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; relationship to the concept of reciprocity, that there is no substantial
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; ethical difference between violence as I defined it (e.g. rape and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; murder), and &quot;economic force&quot;, including the subjective harm of seeing a
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; billboard. You are blurring any ethical distinctions between voluntary
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; and involuntary acts, denying the existence of voluntary interactions.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I see an *ethical* difference between violence such as rape and murder on
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the one hand, and putting up billboards, on the other hand. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I analyze them both mechanically as exercises of force. One exercise of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force I would really object to being applied to myself, the other exercise
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of force I would only mildly object to being applied to myself. (I am
</em><br>
<em>&gt; politically so lazy I could not imagine bothering to try to stop people
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from putting up billboards. There are so many other more efficient ways to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; improve my lifestyle.) 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Voluntary acts arise from decision-making centers
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in the brain, which are formed mechanically by conception and birth
</em><br>
<em>&gt; (cellular replication and differentiation of the organ) and environmental
</em><br>
<em>&gt; influences (chemical environments during the previous stage, sensory
</em><br>
<em>&gt; inputs, conceptual memories, etc. etc.). As systems, they process input to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; provide feedback. They are continually open and dynamic to the
</em><br>
<em>&gt; environment, exercising force (ultimately through muscular controls) and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; having forces exercised upon them. I am not trying to reduce analysis, but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; this is the real ground of the explanation of why economic forces can
</em><br>
<em>&gt; affect&quot;voluntary&quot; decisions. Everything is ultimately grounded in one system -
</em><br>
<em>&gt; force cannot be attributed to one original cause or traced to any final
</em><br>
<em>&gt; single consequence.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Furthermore, you postulated the need to use complex rules to replace
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; legal principles derived through hundreds of years of legal practice
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; from the simple distinctions I described, although  you did not provide
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; a means of assessing the validity of such complex rules. Also, you deny
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; the validity of personal responsibility, instead describing individual
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; behaviors as results of &quot;forces&quot; depriving an individual of choices.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; Finally, you define ethics aesthetics in a manner at odds with commonly
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; accepted usage.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Assessing the validity of the complex rules - the validity of the theories
</em><br>
<em>&gt; have to rest in the best, most all-encompassing understanding of human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beings and their societies and cultures we have. Certainly a work in
</em><br>
<em>&gt; progress, but the law in most cases has been insulated from many insights
</em><br>
<em>&gt; of the various disciplines. Perhaps the reason is that any adjustment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; would involve mind-boggling, wholesale changes - even a displacement of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;law&quot; as we know it.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Personal responsibility is real at a certain level, the level of personal
</em><br>
<em>&gt; introspection through cultural categories. But in the most detailed,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; material analysis it disappears. To put it into a simplistic
</em><br>
<em>&gt; slogan: nobody is ultimately responsible for anything - everything just is
</em><br>
<em>&gt; the way it is. Part of what a lot of things are, is &quot;responsible&quot;. But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; they are not ultimately responsible for being responsible :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>### Playing with subtly shifting definitions of common terms, to derive
<br>
startling conclusions (&quot;law should be displaced (=abandoned)&quot;, &quot;nobody
<br>
is responsible for anything&quot;) is a moderately pleasant pastime, but I
<br>
was approaching our discussion with concern for the practicalities of
<br>
building and maintaining social and legal systems capable of meeting my
<br>
needs. Indefinite verbal constructions tend to interfere with such
<br>
practicalities, undermining the rationale for further discussion.
