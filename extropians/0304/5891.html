</em><br>
<p>BTW the original version of the TCPA FAQ is at
<br>
<a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/tcpa-faq.html">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rja14/tcpa-faq.html</a> and includes some extra
<br>
links at the bottom.
<br>
<p>As far as whether computers today are capable enough to run all the
<br>
killer apps, that is a pretty static view of things.  Five, ten years
<br>
from now computers will undoubtedly be far more powerful than the ones
<br>
we have today, and I strongly suspect that new applications will have
<br>
been developed which will use that extra power.  I don't see any reason
<br>
why progress will suddenly stop, with a ca 2003 computer providing all
<br>
the capbility anyone will ever need.
<br>
<p>In terms of TCPA/Palladium being crippled, the inventors of these
<br>
systems claim the opposite.  They argue that trusted computing adds
<br>
functionality while retaining backwards compatibility.  You can still
<br>
run all the apps you want from today, plus you can now run a whole
<br>
new class of applications, so-called trusted applications.  These have
<br>
access to a new type of functionality that lets them prove to remote
<br>
systems that they can be trusted to handle data in a specified manner.
<br>
This can be used to improve the security of many applications, including
<br>
digital rights management.
<br>
<p>In a few years, it might be that content companies will sell you legal
<br>
music and movies over the net, but only if you are running a trusted
<br>
computing system.  Those systems will let you run an app which can prove
<br>
to the remote server that it will follow the DRM rules, it will encrypt
<br>
the data that has been downloaded so that other programs can't get access
<br>
to it, and it will limit copying of the data.
<br>
<p>No one is forcing you to run such an app, and no one is forcing the
<br>
content companies to download the data to you.  The trusted computing
<br>
technology makes possible a new kind of transaction which cannot occur
<br>
today.  Consumers may choose to adopt this technology in order to take
<br>
part in these kinds of transactions.  There is no need for coercion
<br>
or a legal mandate.
<br>
<p>Why would you revolt and attempt to kill this technology?  What gives
<br>
you the wisdom to intervene in a free choice by another person to
<br>
decide what technology to use?  You would not object if a person tried
<br>
to use cryptography to cloak his communications with someone else.  What
<br>
is wrong with someone using technology that lets him make a kind of
<br>
commitment that is not possible today?
<br>
<p>It frankly astonishes me that libertarians oppose trusted computing
<br>
technology.  I seem to be the only one who sees things differently.
<br>
I believe in freedom.  That means I accept that other people may make
<br>
decisions differently than I would.  Their decisions may even have
<br>
an indirectly negative impact on me.  But I would not say that I was
<br>
justified in trying to take options away from them, to prevent them from
<br>
using a technology like this.  I would really appreciate a libertarian
<br>
and freedom oriented explanation of why voluntarily-adopted trusted
<br>
computing technology should be fought.
