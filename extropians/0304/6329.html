<p>Defense Department expands nanotechnology research. Nanoscale materials and
<br>
components, including some of the tiniest products ever manufactured, have
<br>
already found their way into communications systems and weapons being used
<br>
in the war with Iraq. But the role of nanotechnology is still so limited
<br>
that the Iraq war will more likely be remembered as the last to be fought
<br>
without its benefits than the first that fully deployed it. (SiliconValley

<p>Electrifying claims for DNA are dashed. Can DNA conduct electricity? Some
<br>
physicists claim it is a superconductor. Others believe it does not conduct
<br>
electricity at all. And biologists have agonized about how conductivity
<br>
might affect its function. A consensus is emerging. Although the much-hyped
<br>
molecule can transport electrons over a length of a few base pairs, allowing
<br>
it to deflect oxidative damage away from important sections (New Scientist
<br>
print edition, 15 March), it fails to conduct over longer distances. That
<br>
will dash long-held hopes that the self-replicating molecule could be
<br>
harnessed to make self-assembling nanowires. Researchers from the University
<br>
of California, Los Angeles, have hammered the final nail in the coffin with
<br>
an exhaustive paper submitted to Physical Review Letters. (NewScientist

<p>$1 billion places U.S. on nanoroad. The race for the high ground in
<br>
nanotechnology development and applications is heating as U.S. government
<br>
efforts gain momentum, funding and direction. Legislation promoting
<br>
nanotechnology development in electronics, energy and medicine has been
<br>
introduced in both the House and Senate. At the same time, government
<br>
science and technology agencies are working to funnel federal funds to the
<br>
right programs, as industry and universities gear up to move promising
<br>
technologies like carbon nanotubes from the laboratory to market. Congress
<br>
approved $849 million for nanotechnology research and development in fiscal
<br>
2003. &quot;We're rapidly heading toward a $1 billion program,&quot; said Richard
<br>
Russell of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. &quot;Now's
<br>
the time to shape the program.&quot;

<p>Go-go Atoms Give Heat the Shake. Like so many go-go dancers gyrating in
<br>
their cages, atoms in the nooks of a metallic crystal shake independently,
<br>
physicists report in the 4 April PRL. The randomly rattling atoms deflect
<br>
heat-carrying vibrations, and the observation could lead to new materials
<br>
that cool by carrying a current, or that convert heat into electricity.

<p>UC Riverside Researchers' Discovery Of Electrostatic Spin Topples
<br>
Century-old Theory. In a discovery that is likely to impact fields as
<br>
diverse as atomic physics, chemistry and nanotechnology, researchers have
<br>
identified a new physical phenomenon, electrostatic rotation, that, in the
<br>
absence of friction, leads to spin. Because the electric force is one of the
<br>
fundamental forces of nature, this leap forward in understanding may help
<br>
reveal how the smallest building blocks in nature react to form solids,
<br>
liquids and gases that constitute the material world around us.

<p>Argonne researchers use electric field to manipulate tiny particles.
<br>
Intricate patterns formed by granular materials under the influence of
<br>
electrostatic fields have scientists at the U.S. Department of Energy's
<br>
Argonne National Laboratory dreaming of new ways to create smaller
<br>
structures for nanotechnologies. With a combination of electric fields and
<br>
fluid mixtures, researchers Igor Aronson, Maksim Sapozhnikov, Yuri Tolmachev
<br>
and Wai Kwok can cause tiny spheres of bronze and other metals to
<br>
self-assemble into crystalline patterns, honeycombs, pulsating rings and
<br>
bizarre two-lobed structures that whirl like tiny propellers. Such
<br>
self-assembling behavior could be exploited to create the next generation
<br>
nanostructures or tiny micromechanical devices. (3/35/03)

<p>Experimental stress determination increases accuracy in microelectronics.
<br>
With the advent of nanotechnology, miniature devices are increasingly
<br>
becoming more popular and industries are continuously searching to improve
<br>
techniques for achieving higher performance. Towards this aim, this EC
<br>
funded project designed a new experimental method for determination of local
<br>
strains with the aid of X-ray microdiffraction. The new method is expected
<br>
to bring significant advances in crystalline structures that are used in a

wide range of applications from microelectronics to bio- and engineering

<p>Molecular might. Nanotech 'battle suits' could amplify soldiers' powers. As
<br>
hollow-eyed troops laden with 75-pound packs slogged through a downpour
<br>
before shipping out to Kuwait, nine MIT professors watching them in the
<br>
rural Louisiana training field were asking questions like: How could those
<br>
loads be made lighter? And what about making the soldiers impervious to
<br>
infection? Invulnerable to bullets? Able to leap small buildings in a single
<br>
bound? For these self-described &quot;crazy MIT guys,&quot; those questions are not
<br>
wild geek imaginings inspired by some superhero comic. It's their job. The
<br>
professors who visited the Fort Polk training center in January are at the
<br>
vanguard of a military initiative to harness the potential of the emerging
<br>
field of nanotechnology. (SFGate 4/7/03)
