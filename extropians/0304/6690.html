<em>&gt; Some people care about what others think more than others do.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; There are many occasions when one has to worry about what one
</em><br>
<em>&gt; will think of himself, rather than be concerned about what
</em><br>
<em>&gt; others will think.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<p>I don't see how this generality is germane to the particular 
<br>
situation.  The topic is about US reputation.  Those who do not 
<br>
care about the US reputation will presumably not be contributing 
<br>
or reading this thread.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;That we didn't do it [assign soldiers to guard the museum]
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;isn't going to cut much ice.  We were in charge, and didn't 
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;do anything to stop it or put out the fire, or even collect
</em><br>
<em>&gt;&gt;the scraps of parchment that flutter out on the flames.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &quot;We were in charge&quot;?  Actually, that's what was being contested.
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>What for?  Our press claims we are in charge and &quot;mopping up&quot;. 
<br>
We even say we are seeking to establish order now.  So why 
<br>
shouldn't we have some responsibility for this event?
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; The deeper issue, alas, as always, is the predictability of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; your making a statement like that.  Have any thoughts on this
</em><br>
<em>&gt; more fundamental issue of why in general you and others are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; on one side and so many other people are clearly on the other?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; What truly distinguishes you from them?
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<p>This is in my opinion uncalled for.  Either the statement is 
<br>
reasonable and raises reaonable issues or it does not.  That X 
<br>
is more likely to make such a statement is irrelevant to this 
<br>
particular thread.  That one is in a minority says nothing for 
<br>
or against the validty of the minority position.
