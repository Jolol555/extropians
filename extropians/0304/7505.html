</em><br>
<p>I have faith in the *science* of evolution, yes. I believe it is well
<br>
established that living organisms are best adapted to the environments in
<br>
which they evolved. This principle is applicable to diets. I mentioned that
<br>
in my view humans are as well adapted to paleodiets as giraffes are well
<br>
adapted to eating the leaves of tall trees. In giraffes this dietary
<br>
adaptation is extremely obvious. Unfortunately in humans our dietary
<br>
adaptive traits are mostly invisible, buried in our metabolisms. 
<br>
<p>Would you argue with a talking giraffe who told you that he thought his long
<br>
neck was for eating the leaves of tall trees? Would you ask him if he was a
<br>
Luddite if he insisted that the leaves of tall trees should be the main
<br>
staple of his diet? 
<br>
<p>Nutritional science, organic chemistry and other branches of the life
<br>
sciences are only beginning to unravel the full picture of human metabolism.
<br>
And the more we learn, the more our nutritional recommendations begin to
<br>
correlate with paleodiet theory. For example it has only been a few years
<br>
since nutritionists discovered that vitamin C works best in the company of
<br>
bioflavonoids and other antioxidants. Similarly, alpha-tocopherol works best
<br>
in the company of gamma-tocopherol. New phytonutrients are being discovered
<br>
constantly. The vitamin supplements you buy today vs 30 years ago contain
<br>
more of the ingredients found in natural paleolithic foods, not less.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you really a neo-Luddite in disguise?  I don't mean to be
</em><br>
<em>&gt; funny or offensive here.  
</em><br>
<p>No, I hardly even know what a Luddite is. :) I'm just a typical guy raised
<br>
in the San Francisco Bay Area who happens to have spent the last five years
<br>
of his life studying diet and nutrition and longevity. I moderate two other
<br>
internet mailing lists devoted to these subjects.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; But you seem to say that we need to
</em><br>
<em>&gt; stick to &quot;natural&quot; diets, and that modern science is not a 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; good guide to figuring things out. 
</em><br>
<p>That is not exactly what I say, Harvey. I consider evolution science to *be*
<br>
modern science. Evolution science is very helpful for &quot;figuring things out.&quot;
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Four millions years of evolution has optimized the human
</em><br>
<em>&gt; genome for surviving just long enough to reproduce
</em><br>
<p>I agree. This is why I'm happy to deviate from a natural diet when there is
<br>
sufficient evidence to do so. I start with the best of what nature can give
<br>
me, and build from there.
<br>
<p>By the way cholesterol and saturated fats should not be avoided completely.
<br>
We need some of each for optimal health. As with many things, moderation is
<br>
key.
