<p>3 April 2003
<br>
<p>Flat lens bends laws of physics
<br>
A University of Toronto researcher is bending far more than light in his new 
<br>
lenses, he’s bending the laws of physics. George Eleftheriades, an associate 
<br>
professor of electrical and computer engineering, has shown experimentally 
<br>
that a flat lens built out of a strange class of materials can actually focus 
<br>
light with better resolution than conventional lenses. His latest results 
<br>
about the lens are to be published in the 7 April issue of Optics Express, 
<br>
and its focusing ability was reported in the 24 March issue of Applied 
<br>
Physics Letters. 
<br>
<p>Normally, a lens has to be curved to focus light, but Eleftheriades showed 
<br>
that you can do the same with a flat lens made out of an artificially created 
<br>
material that bends light the wrong way—a flat lens normally would disperse 
<br>
light, but made of a novel &quot;left-handed&quot; material, it actually focuses it. 
<br>
&quot;If you say you can invert the laws of refraction, it’s really a bold 
<br>
proposition. It’s really new physics,&quot; Eleftheriades told IEEE Spectrum. So 
<br>
new, in fact, that last December scientists were still debating about whether 
<br>
left-handed materials even existed, let alone whether they could focus light. 
<br>
But Eleftheriades demonstrated that his material could and published his work 
<br>
in the December 2002 issue of IEEE Transactions of Microwave Theory and 
<br>
Techniques. The 7 April paper confirms and refines his previous results.
<br>
<p>This seemingly abstract concept could have some very concrete potential. 
<br>
Anything smaller than a wavelength of light, such as atoms and molecules are 
<br>
out of reach for even the best optical microscopes. In his 24 March paper, 
<br>
Eleftheriades presented simulations that showed that his lens can focus and 
<br>
amplify the tiny &quot;subwaves&quot; that carry information about smaller objects. 
<br>
Because the resolution is lower than the wavelength of light, such a lens 
<br>
would let scientists literally see previously invisible objects like atoms. 
<br>
It could also focus light into an area smaller than its wavelength creating 
<br>
sharp beams that could be used to burn more information onto CDs or etch more 
<br>
tightly packed features onto semiconductor chips. The lens could similarly 
<br>
focus RF waves to enhance the bandwidth on cell phones and make more 
<br>
effective antennas.
