<p>But perhaps you should expect just that.  Much appearant sensory 
<br>
evidence is actually internally generated fill.  The classic 
<br>
demonstration is the psychology class where a man is stabbed by someone 
<br>
who rushes in, stabs the person, they collapse, and then he rushes out.  
<br>
Few people notice that what he was stabbed with was a banana.  They 
<br>
disagree on the details of the knife, but that's what they saw.
<br>
<p>Given that experiment, it seems likely to me that much of our &quot;reality&quot; 
<br>
is interpolation, but that we can't easily tell the difference.
<br>
<p>That said, I don't consider a hallucination supplied by a &quot;God&quot; to be 
<br>
any proof.  I've encountered a few, and decided that they were 
<br>
projections from activated archetypes (I was going through a heavily 
<br>
Jungian period).  Again, these are difficult to notice as what they 
<br>
are.  A starlet isn't called a &quot;love goddess&quot; by mistake.  When people 
<br>
see her, they are projecting an emotional hallucination from the 
<br>
internal &quot;love goddess&quot; onto the image that they see.  There are other 
<br>
gods, and they act the same way.  I don't believe in the messages that 
<br>
they provide... their hit rate seems pretty low.  But they exist.  I 
<br>
suspect that in the environment for which we evolved they were much more 
<br>
accurate.  Think of them as one of the necessary preconditions for 
<br>
language coming into existence.  But when you encounter them, you can't 
<br>
be rational (except partially).  Rational judgements need to be 
<br>
postponed to appreciate the numinosity of the event.  THEN you can 
<br>
rationally analyze it.  But be cautious, for some of the emotional 
<br>
arguments can be quite convincing.
