<p>I don't think that his science is way off mark (although it's a lot further
<br>
in the future than he makes out), or that he's had any problems
<br>
understanding nanotech. It seems pretty clear to me that he has quite
<br>
deliberately set out to trash nanotech, and has written a rather contrived
<br>
novel to that end. I wouldn't expect him to be writing a retraction any time
<br>
soon.
<br>
<p>OTOH, I found this rather reasonable, (dare I say it, transhumanist?)
<br>
interview with Crichton online. 
<br>
<a href="http://www.readersread.com/features/michaelcrichton.htm">http://www.readersread.com/features/michaelcrichton.htm</a>
<br>
He is not ignorant about current technologies, and seems in this interview
<br>
to be rather in favour of them. Now I'm confused.
