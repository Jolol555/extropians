<p>True, plus the cows have to get their calcium from somewhere...

<p><em>&gt; green leafy vegetables like spinach, contain more than enough calcium. AND

<p>I'd hardly tell anyone not to eat veggies, but eating enough seems like a

challenge, or expensive.

<p><em>&gt; Rickets was a major national health problem here in US in the early part of

<p>Rickets seems to be caused by vitamin D shortage...
<br>
<p><em>&gt; In itself flour is little more than sugar. It is broken down into sugar
</em><br>
<p>Looking at nutritional labels there's a fair bit of protein, fiber, and iron
<br>
there as well, especially for whole wheat flour.  One test I do is to ask
<br>
&quot;what would I be getting if I got all 2000 of my calories from this food?&quot; and
<br>
good breads and pasta hold up decently.  Not complete, but not pure sugar,
<br>
either.  Some veggies hold up even better, but getting all your calories from
<br>
veggies is definitely a challenge...

<p><em>&gt; &gt; A book on Australia I just read noted the aborigines trading

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; I would say those aborigines are better described a Neolithic rather than

</em><br>
<p>I would say we can't be that sure of what exactly the Paleolithic diet was.
<br>
I've looked into it before myself, and opinions seem to range from &quot;lots of
<br>
meat&quot; to &quot;lots of vegetables nuts and seeds&quot;.  And the aborigines were still
<br>
pretty healthy.  Diverse diet good, yes.  I'm much less convinced of &quot;grains
<br>
bad&quot;.
