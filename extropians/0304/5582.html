What bothers me is, we don't have the number of his own people that
<br>
Sadam would have killed if his regime was left to it's own devices to
<br>
compare these numbers with.
<br>
<p>Much less those who will be saved by turning Iraq's oil into food and
<br>
medicine instead of missiles and poisons.
<br>
<p>My bet is that there would be positive payback in number of lives saved
<br>
vs. lost in less that a year.

<p><p><p><p>Perhaps this was mentioned here before, but here is a rough number of
<br>
the Iraq civilians killed in the War in Iraq:
<br>
<p><a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/">http://www.iraqbodycount.net/</a>  (currently inching up near 600 killed)
<br>
<p>The compilers on that web page state their methodology
<br>
and  their sources for these  numbers and they seem (I don't know for
<br>
sure) to take considerable care and effort to determine these numbers.
<br>
<p>People aren't numbers. However, this is one of the most important
<br>
measures I presently have showing the precious (and outrageous) costs of
<br>
this war.
