</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Not so fast Aubrey -- if cost were not a problem then we would be
<br>
much further along by now (indeed as you point out the ideas may
<br>
be a decade or more old).  You have to keep in mind that I've
<br>
spent $ millions of my own and others funds simply trying to
<br>
do the analysis part of the problem -- the engineering solutions
<br>
part can be much more expensive.  Its slowly getting cheaper
<br>
but it could become *much* cheaper if funding sources would
<br>
make the right investments.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; No, no point -- elephants and whales have so vastly lower a specific
</em><br>
<em>&gt; metabolic rate that they don't need better maintenance machinery than
</em><br>
<em>&gt; us in order to live longer.  (This is not to say that oxidative damage
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is the only thing that matters in aging, of course, only that it affects
</em><br>
<em>&gt; everything.)
</em><br>
<p>Has there been any work to determine whether the lower metabolic
<br>
rate directly correlates with a lower cancer rate for their mass
<br>
(or # of cells)?  I.e. do they have better cancer defenses than we
<br>
do or is it indeed due precisely to lower free radical production?
<br>
I've gone through the literature and both whales and elephants
<br>
do get cancer -- but in whales the cases seem to be associated
<br>
with pollution and in elephants it seems to be quite rare.
<br>
<p>The sequencing would still make sense from the perspective of
<br>
looking at protein susceptibility to nitrosylation or deamidation.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Give me the $50m, I could spend it much better than that...
</em><br>
<p>I'm sure we both could... :-)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Also, a genetic code disparity (UGA encoding STOP in the nucleus but
</em><br>
<em>&gt; tryptophan in the mitochondria) has been present since animals diverged
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from fungi (~1 billion years) and has totally prevented any gene transfer
</em><br>
<em>&gt; in that time -- all animals encode exactly the same 13 protein in their
</em><br>
<em>&gt; mtDNA.
</em><br>
<p>Have you actually verified this?  I was under the impression that
<br>
there was a significant variance in mtDNA sizes but of course you
<br>
have looked at this more than I.
<br>
<p>I also disagree that evolution could not pull a rabbit out of the
<br>
hat.  It would depend entirely on how many UGAs there would be
<br>
in a specific mtGene.  I consider the prospect of adding a mt Signal
<br>
Sequence to be much more difficult than fixing the UGA problem.
<br>
After all one cannot know how frequently mutated mtDNA might substitute
<br>
all of the UGA codes with UGG codons (allowing an alternate Trp
<br>
coding) and subsequently transfer the genes to the nucleus.
<br>
<p>There are other problems, see:
<br>
<a href="http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/Codons.html">http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/C/Codons.html</a>
<br>
under &quot;Mitochondrial Genes&quot; -- but I'm not completely buying the
<br>
argument that gene migration in higher level organisms is &quot;impossible&quot;.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; An alternate
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; process might be more robust mtDNA repair -- right now its pretty
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; minimal compared to the nucleus (something like 120+ nuclear DNA
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; repair proteins).
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; No - reversal or obviation of damage is what we need, not retardation.
</em><br>
<p>One probably needs both -- there isn't a lot of conclusive evidence
<br>
that you can reduce the gene hydrophobicity enough to get all of the
<br>
genes into the nucleus so one may always be left with some mtDNA.
<br>
If so then one needs to increase the mt DNA damage prevention
<br>
and/or DNA repair capacities.  I believe that some of the few
<br>
lifespan extending techniques via genetic engineering that have
<br>
been demonstrated to date involve targeting anti-oxidant proteins
<br>
into the mitochondria.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Progress is being made here -- we now know roughly where in Complex
</em><br>
<em>&gt; I and precisely where in Complex III the superoxide is made.  But
</em><br>
<em>&gt; making a modified enzyme that makes less (a) is probably very hard
</em><br>
<em>&gt; and (b) only retards aging, doesn't reverse it, so we might as well
</em><br>
<em>&gt; focus on a proper solution (nuclearising the genes).
</em><br>
<p>For the reasons cited above we may need to try to do both.
<br>
<p>Another question is whether the SO is being made by &quot;perfect&quot;
<br>
proteins or damaged proteins?  If the proteins are becoming
<br>
damaged and increasing SO production then we are back to the
<br>
protein recycling issue all over again.
