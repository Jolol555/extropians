<p>Finally -- an *interesting* topic worthy of extropic discussion!
<br>
<p><em>&gt; However, here is article discussing a paper by an MIT social scientist that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; indicates that social capital is decreased by ethnic and cultural diversity:
</em><br>
<em>&gt;
</em><br>
<em>&gt; <a href="http://vdare.com/letters/tl_033103.htm">http://vdare.com/letters/tl_033103.htm</a>
</em><br>
<p>I have not yet read this paper (so subsequent comments may be ill-informed).
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have always thought that the basic premise that diversity is inherently
</em><br>
<em>&gt; beneficial is flawed,
</em><br>
<p>I would tend to agree with this.  It would seem (to me) that promoting
<br>
diversity is like promoting masturbation.  It may be rewarding in the
<br>
short term but it isn't guaranteed to get you anywhere.
<br>
<p>The phase space of possible activities is much larger than the phase
<br>
space of extropic activities.  (Why do you think Eliezer or Greg
<br>
try to do spin control on the ExI list threads...)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I have always thought that it was obvious, mainly because it is much easier
</em><br>
<em>&gt; for the citizenry to control the govt when the populace is homogenous.
</em><br>
<p>I think this perspective may be flawed.  One does not want the govt
<br>
&quot;controlling&quot; the citezenry or the citizenry &quot;controlling&quot; the govt.
<br>
<p>Either of those perspectives seems (to me) unlikely to explore the
<br>
phase space of creativity productively.
<br>
<p>What we would like to do is maximize creativity -- perhaps bordering
<br>
on chaos -- and at the same time develop methods for selecting and
<br>
promoting the ideas that are most extropic while at the same time
<br>
nurturing those that may grow more slowly but might in the long run
<br>
have a more significant impact.
<br>
<p>So one wants to strongly promote creativity (and potentially diversity)
<br>
but one wants to wield a sharp sword (natural selection?) for those
<br>
developments most extropic while at the same time having some awareness
<br>
that there might well be &quot;sleepers&quot; in the nest.  Very difficult IMO.
<br>
<p>There are significant elements of this in the current Western grant
<br>
application and review process -- but it may be offset by &quot;group
<br>
think&quot;.  This may be offset by things like the &quot;National Center for
<br>
Complementary and Alternative Medicine&quot;.  But as I think Rafal may
<br>
have recently implied getting the folks in that camp to play by the
<br>
credibility rules may be rather difficult (why else wouldn't their
<br>
grants be funded...).
<br>
<p>So extropes are caught in a difficult position -- one wants to
<br>
promote creativity and diversity but one probably does not want
<br>
it to reach X-files levels.
<br>
<p>R.
