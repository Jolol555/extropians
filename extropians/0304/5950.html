</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are in calling the KKK scum.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to say &quot;Hey gts, what do you think
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; about the KKK?&quot; is it really inconceivable
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; that you would reply &quot;They're scum&quot;; and
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; should I think less of you if you did?
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally I feel it is perfectly correct,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; &gt; they are scum.
</em><br>
<p>One give-away clue is that the definition &quot;scum&quot;
<br>
makes utterly no contribution to the discussion.
<br>
<p>I then went on:
<br>
<p><em>&gt; &gt; I find such emotional outbursts understandable,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; but inaccurate.  The name-calling does nothing more 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; than connote the emotional state of the speaker.  Are
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; we to suppose that there is such a thing as &quot;emotional
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; correctness&quot;?  From many others' posts on this list, I
</em><br>
<em>&gt; &gt; think that about sizes it up.
</em><br>
<p>and Mike answers
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Describing such by their right names is not 'an emotional outburst'.
</em><br>
<p>Right names?  &quot;Scum&quot;?  Be serious.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; What is wrong with name calling anyways?  My name is Mike.
</em><br>
<em>&gt; You call me Mike, you are name calling.
</em><br>
<p>You are using a tangential meaning of the terms employed,
<br>
and not even doing a very good job.  Usually when people
<br>
stoop to this, it is done skillfully.  (I think that you
<br>
don't have much practice in this sort of deception.)
<br>
<p><em>&gt; I doubt very much that anybody on this list would ever
</em><br>
<em>&gt; say &quot;David Duke is an okay fellow to hang out with, it
</em><br>
<em>&gt; is just his opinions I despise.&quot;
</em><br>
<p>They might indeed!  I've even gone so far as to say that
<br>
Hitler and Stalin might be great people to share a jail
<br>
cell with for a year.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Does anybody claim that Jeff Dahmer had any socially
</em><br>
<em>&gt; redeeming qualities?
</em><br>
<p>Who knows?  You'd have to know him a lot better than anyone
<br>
here does.  Would he keep his word on small matters in day
<br>
to day life?  Would he be coarse and unpleasant?  Would he
<br>
readily agree to do his part of the family (or prison) tasks?
<br>
Would he be charitable towards others in a small working
<br>
groups, (provided that they didn't appear to tasty and that
<br>
being in private with them was not possible)?
<br>
<p><em>&gt; That Kim Jong Il is just a misunderstood son of an overachieving
</em><br>
<em>&gt; father?  That Saddam is just the obvious result of an abusive childhood?
</em><br>
<p>The first appears to be a megalomaniac (as probably is/was the second).
<br>
The second is known to be a mass murderer.  But it would be rather
<br>
childish to describe either as &quot;scum&quot;, &quot;naughty-naughties&quot;, or dumb bells.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; While most people of many different opinions are generally of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; benevolent intent toward their fellow man, even those I disagree with,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; there are people who are seriously deficient in various qualities that
</em><br>
<em>&gt; make one a rational, compassionate, logical, non-evil human being.
</em><br>
<p>Yes, and vocabulary exists to describe them meaningfully.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Similarly, just as there are individuals who are inherently evil, there
</em><br>
<em>&gt; are also individuals who are, despite being entirely benevolent of
</em><br>
<em>&gt; intent, entirely dingbats in their thought processes toward applying
</em><br>
<em>&gt; such intents to reality, or in perceiving the reality around them.
</em><br>
<p>I'd agree to that, though we might not exactly agree who
<br>
fits this description.  My hunch is that you might be too
<br>
ready to apply this description when I'd merely concede
<br>
that the person in question was not stupid at all, but had
<br>
extremely different values or intuitions about human nature.
<br>
<p><em>&gt; If the name does not accurately reflect the individual being described,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; it is rightly improper.  But if it accurately describes the individual,
</em><br>
<em>&gt; then the quack describes the duck.
</em><br>
<p>Yep.  But we should really ask ourselves, before indulging in
<br>
something that smacks of name-calling, just what the content
<br>
of the abusing term really is.  &quot;Scum&quot; or &quot;asshole&quot; or &quot;jackass&quot;
<br>
rarely, very rarely, cut it.
