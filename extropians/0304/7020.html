<p>&lt;&lt; If Cricthton wrote about everything working out just chummy, he would 
<br>
never 
<br>
&nbsp;get published. If Peter Benchley had written about the number and 
<br>
&nbsp;characteristics of shark attacks, Jaws would have been published as a vanity 
<br>
&nbsp;press release. Drama is usually a way of understanding the potential of a 
<br>
&nbsp;problem, and then having the author use his imagination to thrill people by 
<br>
&nbsp;it. This is akin to roller coaster affcianado's screaming through the thrill 
<br>
&nbsp;ride. Dangerous, but almost completely safe, assuming one hasn't eaten 
<br>
&nbsp;beforehand. There have been a few thrillers about computers going haywire 
<br>
and 
<br>
&nbsp;staring nuclear wars, or the hideous and terrifying dangers of the internet. 
<br>
&nbsp;But for the vast majority of us critters, things are a bit of ok. Drama is 
<br>
&nbsp;used for peddling novels, and promoting movies. If the X-Men, and company, 
<br>
&nbsp;were liked and accepted, there would be no X-Men 2, no Terminator 3, No Matr
<br>
&nbsp;ix Reloaded. &gt;&gt;
<br>
<p>All very good points, Spudboy! But, I personally would like to see a movie 
<br>
where the tech is NOT the main problem, but the problems ASSOCIATED with 
<br>
incorporation of the technologies into everyday life are the main focus of 
<br>
the plot (ala &quot;Minority Report&quot; ::GAG:: style?). One good example of this is 
<br>
the Anime movie &quot;Metropolis&quot;, (loosely based on Fritz Lang's movie). This 
<br>
movie focuses on how all different strata of society deal with robots getting 
<br>
&quot;lives&quot; of their own. Get the English dubbed version, reading subtitles just 
<br>
doesn't make the movie as enjyable (the artwork is phenomenal!).
