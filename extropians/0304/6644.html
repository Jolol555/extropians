&nbsp;Cro-Magnon Clans Urged to Go Slow With Fire (Score:5, Funny)

by reallocate (142797)  on Wednesday April 16, @03:30PM (#5745849)  
<br>
(Cro-Magnon News Agency) -- Shamans and clan activists are questioning the 
<br>
wisdom of allowing widespread use of newly discovered techniques for 
<br>
artificially producing fire.
<br>
<p>A Chauvet-Pont-d'Arc meeting, sponsored by Clans United for Ethical 
<br>
Technology, today issued a resolution calling on clan and tribal leaders to 
<br>
block the spread of fire-making techniques to the general population.
<br>
<p>&quot;We must insure that making fire remains under the strict control of shamans 
<br>
and our clan leaders,&quot; said Clans United chief, Orm Marr-dhuk. &quot;Tests have 
<br>
indicated that fire is dangerous if not handled properly. We fear that its 
<br>
widespread use could result in countless deaths by burning and the loss of 
<br>
many of the forests on which we all depend for shelter and food. Pending new 
<br>
developments, Clans United urges our leaders to decree that fire making will 
<br>
remain the exclusive privilege of the shaman and leadership classes. Perhaps 
<br>
someday, if the common people have developed the skills to use fire without 
<br>
risking life and limb, we can reconsider our recommendation.&quot;
<br>
<p>When asked about the several flaming tar torches that provided light for the 
<br>
meeting at the Cauvet cave, Chief Orm replied that &quot;We shamans have made the 
<br>
appropriate sacrifices to the goddess. She has given us the secrets of safe 
<br>
fire use. We cannot expect ordinary people to understand these things.&quot;
