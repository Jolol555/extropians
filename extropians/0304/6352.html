</em><br>
<p>I agree with your point, but state further that hunter-gatherer cultures
<br>
(those very few that remain) are the best models we have of prehistoric
<br>
Paleolithic cultures. The problem I was pointing out is that many primitive
<br>
cultures studied by cultural anthropologists are not HG cultures, and that
<br>
is a mistake to assume those cultures are models of the Paleolithic
<br>
life-style, which was entirely HG.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; I don't know whether I failed abysmally at communicating or

</em><br>
<p>Right, and I presumed you were referring to hunting tools more sophisticated
<br>
than spears and arrows (and altatl's and boomerangs). 
<br>
<p><em>&gt; Are you presuming that... there are only two
</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>Very roughly speaking, yes. I'm also pointing out that wild game was more
<br>
plentiful in prehistoric times, which helped to offset the increased
<br>
difficulty of hunting with primitive weapons. As I mentioned, it is
<br>
theorized that prehistoric humans actually hunted many species into
<br>
extinction. This may have given impetus to the agricultural revolution.
<br>
Hungry people had to find a way to survive.
<br>
<p>I'll find that Cordain article that you requested off-list, and post
<br>
excerpts here and send you the full text by email.
