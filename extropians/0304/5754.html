</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; Debate - honest, rational debate - requires commitment
</em><br>
<em>&gt; from both sides.  If you enter a situation where the
</em><br>

</em><br>

</em><br>
<p>I have to agree with the above. Even on this forum, where logic, reasonable 
<br>
debate and carefully considered positions are all actively selected for, the 
<br>
actual number of well reasoned debates that I've encountered here have been 
<br>
small.
<br>
<p>One of the major problems that I note is communication.  Its amazing how 
<br>
often one person will very clearly state the position: A-&gt;B, only to have 
<br>
their opponent 'interpret' this as: F(A)-&gt;G(B) where F and G are arbitrary 
<br>
functions imposed during the interpretation such that the results which are 
<br>
'understood' by the opponent have no bearing on what the original poster 
<br>
stated.  When BOTH sides are doing this interpreting (as seems to be the most 
<br>
common case) is it any wonder that nothing can be agreed on?
<br>
<p>One of the ancient Greeks (Aristotle? Sophocles? I forget) once pointed out 
<br>
that in order to have an actual DEBATE you must first carefully sit down and 
<br>
compare your axioms and your language. Otherwise, you wont know what someone 
<br>
else means when they say something, nor will you know those things that they 
<br>
feel go without saying.
<br>
<p>To bring things back to the topic line, I have been in discussions where 
<br>
someone has succeeded in changing my point of view.  So far, this has only 
<br>
ever occurred when discussing something in person and never in an online 
<br>
debate. Examining what these events have in common might shed some light on 
<br>
the whole topic (or perhaps just on what it takes to persuade me of 
<br>
something...)
<br>
<p>So, all of these events seemed to have the following things in common:
<br>
<p>1) They were all long, intense debates.  By that I mean that we traded 
<br>
arguments back and forth at the rate of several a minute for the better part 
<br>
of an hour.  This is not an unsually long conversation, but would be an 
<br>
unusually long thread in most online communities.
<br>
<p>2) There were only two of us. Its hard enough to keep track of what you've 
<br>
discussed and what the other person appears to believe when there are only 
<br>
two of you. When there are three or more, its hopeless.
<br>
<p>3) I was talking with someone who's opinion I respect, and who I know has 
<br>
respect for me.  Thus, whenever things appeared to be heading towards 
<br>
personal attacks or deliberate misinterpretation, I KNEW that it was in fact 
<br>
due to some sort of communications problem, and would focus on that until we 
<br>
were once again on the same wavelength.  Sadly, this is practically unheard-
<br>
of in the online world.
<br>
<p>4) My opponent was willing to SHUT UP long enough for me to think about the 
<br>
implications of what they had said.  I find that in any number of occasions, 
<br>
someone has said something profound during a conversation.  Something that 
<br>
MIGHT potentially challenge my viewpoint, and cause me to change it, but they 
<br>
wont stop talking long enough for me to commit it to memory, and it gets 
<br>
lost. And, of course, they never know what they said that might have been 
<br>
profound (to me) and cannot repeat it.  This at least is not a problem in the 
<br>
online community, where you can take (and should take) as long as you need to 
<br>
think about someone's post before you reply.
<br>
<p>5) The clincher to any debate, the thing that turns the tide, is almost 
<br>
always something trivial to the speaker. Its usually one of the 'goes without 
<br>
saying' things that we disagree on, and until someone actually expresses this 
<br>
minor point, we don't even know that its the sticking point of the entire 
<br>
conversation. Once this point has been brought into the light, we then end up 
<br>
in some sort of agreement, either by someone changing points of view, by 
<br>
discovering that we agreed all along but from different viewpoints, or by 
<br>
discovering that we totally disagree on that one axiom, and there's nothing 
<br>
further to debate on the subject.  I think that because typing takes more 
<br>
effort than speaking (for the vast majority) then its these trivial points 
<br>
that never get stated, since the effort is always put into presenting one's 
<br>
(in one's own oppinion) more complex and more 'persuasive' arguments in as 
<br>
clear a manner as possible.
