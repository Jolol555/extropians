<em>&gt; A few days ago I posted a message here about the conversation I had with my
</em><br>
<em>&gt; girlfriend about your bulbous head theory (the interesting theory that 1)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; modern mate selection in humans is driven mostly by females, and that 2)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; women are attracted to men with large heads because their babies have large
</em><br>
<em>&gt; heads, and that 3) this has caused the evolution of larger heads and larger
</em><br>
<em>&gt; brains.)
</em><br>
<p>Yes g, but we are viewing the field long after the game
<br>
is over.  The notion is that females choosing large-headed
<br>
males because they looked a little like children is a
<br>
mechanism that would have been a factor when human heads
<br>
were much smaller than they are today.  I entertain the
<br>
idea that the mechanism caused a positive feedback loop:
<br>
an isolated population of the human/chimp ancestor
<br>
decided for some odd reason to select for big headedness.
<br>
immediate result is individuals capable of actions that
<br>
can be considered secondary sexual ornamentation, such
<br>
as singing, for instance.  Then the females would choose
<br>
the singers, a group that might be slightly larger-brained,
<br>
who gave rise to a subset capable of hurling stones, which
<br>
allowed them to bring home more meat, etc.  Pimp juice
<br>
gave rise to more and better pimp juice.  The process pushed
<br>
hat sizes up until it reached a limit: the size of the
<br>
female pelvis limited infant head sizes.  A negative
<br>
feedback loop kicked in: big headed babies slew their
<br>
mothers (and often themselves) childbirth.
<br>
<p>It is the positive feedback loop I am primarily interested
<br>
in, for I need to understand this in order to get an idea
<br>
what things we should be looking for in the developments
<br>
that precede an AI or singularity.
<br>
<p><p><em>&gt; We'd likely still be living in caves if it weren't for the female thirst for
</em><br>
<em>&gt; pimp juice. :)
</em><br>
<em>&gt; 
</em><br>
<em>&gt; -gts
</em><br>
<p>After I thought it over, I am no longer convinced that
<br>
it matters so much if the mating is female-choice driven
<br>
or male-choice.  As Lee Corbin pointed out, we have a
<br>
current situation where the females can have as many
<br>
children as they want and males have little say in
<br>
the matter really.  Does that have a specific and
<br>
model-able effect on the path of evolution?  Furthermore,
<br>
if we get gene modification, that throws the mate-selection
<br>
mechanism for evolution into high gear.  Or perhaps it
<br>
needs to be modelled as a completely separate mechanism,
<br>
neither survival selection nor mate selection.
