<p>&quot;Modern nutritional science is incomplete&quot;.  It is.  And the way it keeps
<br>
twisting and turning makes it an unreliable guide.  Fifty years from now
<br>
things will hopefully be better.  But right now it's not unreasonable to view
<br>
science as not very useful for reductionist changes in this area, vs. finding
<br>
a gestalt with historical evidence and eating that.

today?
<br>
<p>Having read a lot myself I think the only reliable nutrition recommendations
<br>
are &quot;eat more fruits and veggies&quot; and &quot;eat less/don't be a pig&quot;.  Avoiding
<br>
added sugar and hydrogenated fats also seems a good bet.  And the right fish

is probably good, but look out for mercury, and maybe worry about the
<br>
conservation side of things too (audubon.org has good fish listings).  Beyond
<br>
that it's all various gambles, whether vegetarianism, supplements, paleo,
<br>
Okinawa, or whathaveyou.  Even CR (sure they live longer, but I wonder about
<br>
effects on the brain.)
